<br>§7503. Relation to other audit requirements
<br>
<br>(a) An audit conducted in accordance with this chapter shall be in lieu of any financial audit of Federal awards which a non-Federal entity is required to undergo under any other Federal law or regulation. To the extent that such audit provides a Federal agency with the information it requires to carry out its responsibilities under Federal law or regulation, a Federal agency shall rely upon and use that information.
<br>
<br>(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a), a Federal agency may conduct or arrange for additional audits which are necessary to carry out its responsibilities under Federal law or regulation. The provisions of this chapter do not authorize any non-Federal entity (or subrecipient thereof) to constrain, in any manner, such agency from carrying out or arranging for such additional audits, except that the Federal agency shall plan such audits to not be duplicative of other audits of Federal awards.
<br>
<br>(c) The provisions of this chapter do not limit the authority of Federal agencies to conduct, or arrange for the conduct of, audits and evaluations of Federal awards, nor limit the authority of any Federal agency Inspector General or other Federal official.

<br>
<br>(e) A Federal agency that provides Federal awards and conducts or arranges for audits of non-Federal entities receiving such awards that are in addition to the audits of non-Federal entities conducted pursuant to this chapter shall, consistent with other applicable law, arrange for funding the full cost of such additional audits. Any such additional audits shall be coordinated with the Federal agency determined under criteria issued under section 7504 to preclude duplication of the audits conducted pursuant to this chapter or other additional audits.
<br>
<br>(f) Upon request by a Federal agency or the Comptroller General, any independent auditor conducting an audit pursuant to this chapter shall make the auditor's working papers available to the Federal agency or the Comptroller General as part of a quality review, to resolve audit findings, or to carry out oversight responsibilities consistent with the purposes of this chapter. Such access to auditor's working papers shall include the right to obtain copies.

<br>(1) "included Federal loan program" has the same meaning given that term in section 6103(l)(3)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 6103(l)(3)(C)).
<br>
<br>(2) "taxpayer identifying number" means the identifying number required under section 6109 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 6109).

<br>
<br>(A) a lender or servicer in a Federal guaranteed or insured loan program administered by the agency;
<br>
<br>(B) an applicant for, or recipient of, a Federal license, permit, right-of-way, grant, or benefit payment administered by the agency or insurance administered by the agency;

<br>
<br>(d) Notwithstanding section 552a(b) of title 5, United States Code, creditor agencies to which a delinquent claim is owed, and their agents, may match their debtor records with Department of Health and Human Services, and Department of Labor records to obtain names (including names of employees), name controls, names of employers, taxpayer identifying numbers, addresses (including addresses of employers), and dates of birth.

<br>
<br>(a) The Secretary shall prescribe by regulation standards for the safeguarding and use of obligations that are government securities described in subparagraph (B) or (C) of section 3(a)(42) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such regulations shall apply only to a depository institution that is not a government securities broker or a government securities dealer and that holds such obligations as fiduciary, custodian, or otherwise for the account of a customer and not for its own account. Such regulations shall provide for the adequate segregation of obligations so held, including obligations which are purchased or sold subject to resale or repurchase.
<br>
<br>(b) Violation of a regulation prescribed under subsection (a) shall constitute adequate basis for the issuance of an order under section 5239(a) or (b) of the Revised Statutes (12 U.S.C. 93(a) or (b)), section 8(b) or 8(c) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, section 5(d)(2) or 5(d)(3) 1 of the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933, section 407(e) or 407(f) 1 of the National Housing Act, or section 206(e) or 206(f) of the Federal Credit Union Act. Such an order may be issued with respect to a depository institution by its appropriate regulatory agency and with respect to a federally insured credit union by the National Credit Union Administration.
<br>
<br>(c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect in any way the powers of such agencies under any other provision of law.
<br>
<br>(d) The Secretary shall, prior to adopting regulations under this section, determine with respect to each appropriate regulatory agency and the National Credit Union Administration Board, whether its rules and standards adequately meet the purposes of regulations to be promulgated under this section, and if the Secretary so determines, shall exempt any depository institution subject to such rules or standards from the regulations promulgated under this section.
<br>
<br>(e) As used in this subsection—
<br>
<br>(1) "depository institution" has the meaning stated in clauses (i) through (vi) of section 19(b)(1)(A) of the Federal Reserve Act and also includes a foreign bank, an agency or branch of a foreign bank, and a commercial lending company owned or controlled by a foreign bank (as such terms are defined in the International Banking Act of 1978).
<br>
<br>(2) "government securities broker" has the meaning prescribed in section 3(a)(43) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
<br>
<br>(3) "government securities dealer" has the meaning prescribed in section 3(a)(44) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

<br>§9303. Use of eligible obligations instead of surety bonds
<br>
<br>(a) If a person is required under a law of the United States to give a surety bond, the person may give an eligible obligation as security instead of a surety bond. The obligation shall—
<br>
<br>(1) be given to the official having authority to approve the surety bond;
<br>
<br>(2) as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, have a market value that is equal to or greater than the amount of the required surety bond; and
<br>
<br>(3) authorize the official receiving the obligation to collect or sell the obligation if the person defaults on a required condition.
<br>
<br>(b)(1) An official receiving an eligible obligation under subsection (a) of this section may deposit it with—
<br>
<br>(A) the Secretary of the Treasury;
<br>
<br>(B) a Federal reserve bank; or
<br>
<br>(C) a depositary designated by the Secretary.
<br>
<br>(2) The Secretary, bank, or depositary shall issue a receipt that describes the obligation deposited.
<br>
<br>(c) Using an eligible obligation instead of a surety bond for security is the same as using—
<br>
<br>(1) a personal or corporate surety bond;
<br>
<br>(2) a certified check;
<br>
<br>(3) a bank draft;
<br>
<br>(4) a post office money order; or
<br>
<br>(5) cash.
<br>
<br>(d) When security is no longer required, an eligible obligation given instead of a surety bond shall be returned to the person giving the obligation. If a person, supplying labor or material to a contractor defaulting under sections 3131 and 3133 of title 40, files with the United States Government the application and affidavit provided under section 3133(a) of title 40, the Government—
<br>
<br>(1) may return to the contractor the eligible obligation given as security (or proceeds of the eligible obligation given) under sections 3131 and 3133 of title 40 only after the 90-day period for bringing a civil action under section 3133(b) of title 40; and
<br>
<br>(2) if a civil action is brought in the 90-day period, shall hold the eligible obligation or the proceeds subject to the order of the court having jurisdiction of the action.
<br>
<br>(e) This section does not affect the—
<br>
<br>(1) priority of a claim of the Government against an eligible obligation given under this section;
<br>
<br>(2) right or remedy of the Government for default on an obligation provided under—
<br>
<br>(A) sections 3131 and 3133 of title 40; or
<br>
<br>(B) this section;
<br>
<br>(3) authority of a court over an eligible obligation given as security in a civil action; and
<br>
<br>(4) authority of an official of the Government authorized by another law to receive an eligible obligation as security.
<br>
<br>(f) To avoid frequent substitution of eligible obligations, the Secretary may prescribe regulations limiting the effect of this section to an eligible obligation maturing more than one year after the date the obligation is given as security.
