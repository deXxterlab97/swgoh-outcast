The Attorney General is authorized to pursue any such assigned rights, title, and interest in those claims for the benefit of the Fund.
<br>(iv) Application for conditional payment

<br>(I) In general
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any such claimant's eligibility for payment and the initial deadline for initial payments set forth in subsection (d)(2), the Special Master shall allocate but withhold payment to an eligible claimant who applies for a conditional payment under this paragraph until such time as an adverse final judgment is entered in both of the proceedings identified in clause (iii).

Such portion shall not exceed the difference between the amount of the conditional payment and the amount the Special Master anticipates such claimant will receive from the proceeds of In Re 650 Fifth Avenue & Related Properties.
<br>
<br>(bb) In the event that a final judgment is entered in favor of the plaintiffs in the proceedings captioned Peterson v. Islamic Republic of Iran, No. 10 Civ. 4518 (S.D.N.Y) and funds are distributed, the payments allocated to claimants who applied for a conditional payment under this subparagraph shall be considered void, and any funds previously allocated to such conditional payments shall be made available and distributed to all other eligible claimants pursuant to subsection (d).

<br>
<br>Amounts in the Fund may not be obligated on or after January 2, 2039.
<br>(B) Closing of Fund
<br>
<br>Effective on the day after all amounts authorized to be paid from the Fund under this section that were obligated before January 2, 2039 are expended, any unobligated balances in the Fund shall be transferred, as appropriate, to either the Department of the Treasury Forfeiture Fund established under section 9705 of title 31 or to the Department of Justice Assets Forfeiture Fund established under section 524(c)(1) of title 28.

<br>SUBCHAPTER I—IMPROVING INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION OF CHILD ABUSE CASES
<br>§20301. Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) over 3,300,000 reports of suspected child abuse and neglect are made each year, and drug abuse is associated with a significant portion of these;
<br>
<br>(2) the investigation and prosecution of child abuse cases is extremely complex, involving numerous agencies and dozens of personnel;
<br>
<br>(3) traditionally, community agencies and professionals have different roles in the prevention, investigation, and intervention process;
<br>
<br>(4) in such cases, too often the system does not pay sufficient attention to the needs and welfare of the child victim, aggravating the trauma that the child victim has already experienced;
<br>
<br>(5) there is a national need to enhance coordination among community agencies and professionals involved in the intervention system;
<br>
<br>(6) multidisciplinary child abuse investigation and prosecution programs have been developed that increase the reporting of child abuse cases, reduce the trauma to the child victim, improve positive outcomes for the child, and increase the successful prosecution of child abuse offenders;
<br>
<br>(7) such programs have proven effective, and with targeted Federal assistance, have expanded dramatically throughout the United States; and
<br>
<br>(8) State chapters of children's advocacy center networks are needed to—
<br>
<br>(A) assist local communities in coordinating their multidisciplinary child abuse investigation, prosecution, and intervention services; and
<br>
<br>(B) provide oversight of, and training and technical assistance in, the effective delivery of evidence-informed programming.
