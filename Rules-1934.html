<br>
<br>(A) not appropriated from the general fund of the Treasury; or
<br>
<br>(B) appropriated from the general fund of the Treasury but by law reimbursable from assessment, tax, or other revenue or receipts.
<br>
<br>(2) In general.—The net proceeds of a disposition or transfer of property described in paragraph (1) shall be—
<br>
<br>(A) credited to the applicable reimbursable fund or appropriation; or
<br>
<br>(B) paid to the federal agency that determined the property to be excess.
<br>
<br>(3) Calculation of net proceeds.—For purposes of this subsection, the net proceeds of a disposition or transfer of property are the proceeds less all expenses incurred for the disposition or transfer, including care and handling.
<br>
<br>(4) Alternative credit to miscellaneous receipts.—If the agency that determined the property to be excess decides that it is uneconomical or impractical to ascertain the amount of net proceeds, the proceeds shall be credited to miscellaneous receipts.
<br>
<br>(b) Special Account for Refunds or Payments for Breach.—
<br>
<br>(1) Deposits.—A federal agency that disposes of surplus property under this chapter may deposit, in a special account in the Treasury, amounts of the proceeds of the dispositions that the agency decides are necessary to permit—
<br>
<br>(A) appropriate refunds to purchasers for dispositions that are rescinded or that do not become final; and
<br>
<br>(B) payments for breach of warranty.
<br>
<br>(2) Withdrawals.—A federal agency that deposits proceeds in a special account under paragraph (1) may withdraw amounts to be refunded or paid from the account without regard to the origin of the amounts withdrawn.
<br>

<br>
<br>(d) Acceptance of Property Instead of Cash.—An executive agency entitled to receive cash under a contract for the lease, sale, or other disposition of surplus property may accept property instead of cash if the President determines that the property is strategic or critical material. The property is valued at the prevailing market price when the cash payment becomes due.
<br>
<br>(e) Management of Credit, Leases, and Permits.—For a disposition of surplus property under this chapter, if credit has been extended, or if the disposition has been by lease or permit, the Administrator of General Services, in a manner and on terms the Administrator determines are in the best interest of the Federal Government—
<br>
<br>(1) shall administer and manage the credit, lease, or permit, and any security for the credit, lease, or permit; and
<br>
<br>(2) may enforce, adjust, and settle any right of the Government with respect to the credit, lease, or permit.

<br>Facilitating Access to Federal Property for Siting of Mobile Services Antennas
<br>
<br>Memorandum of President of the United States, Aug. 10, 1995, 60 F.R. 42023, provided:
<br>
<br>Memorandum for the Heads of Departments and Agencies
<br>
<br>Recent advancements in mobile telecommunications technology present an opportunity for the rapid construction of the Nation's wireless communications infrastructure. As a matter of policy, the Federal Government shall encourage the efficient and timely implementation of such new technologies and the concomitant infrastructure buildout as a means of stimulating economic growth and creating new jobs. The recent auctioning and impending licensing of radio frequencies for mobile personal communications services presents the Federal Government with the opportunity to foster new technologies and to encourage the development of communications infrastructure by making Federal property available for the siting of mobile services antennas.
<br>
<br>Therefore, to the extent permitted by law, I hereby direct the Administrator of General Services, within 90 days, in consultation with the Secretaries of Agriculture, Interior, Defense, and the heads of such other agencies as the Administrator may determine, to develop procedures necessary to facilitate appropriate access to Federal property for the siting of mobile services antennas.
<br>
<br>The procedures should be developed in accordance with the following:
<br>
<br>1. (a) Upon request, and to the extent permitted by law and where practicable, executive departments and agencies shall make available Federal Government buildings and lands for the siting of mobile service antennas. This should be done in accordance with Federal, State, and local laws and regulations, and consistent with national security concerns (including minimizing mutual electromagnetic interactions), public health and safety concerns, environmental and aesthetic concerns, preservation of historic buildings and monuments, protection of natural and cultural resources, protection of national park and wilderness values, protection of National Wildlife Refuge systems, and subject to any Federal requirements promulgated by the agency managing the facility and the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Aviation Administration, National Telecommunications and Information Administration, and other relevant departments and agencies.
<br>
<br>(b) Antennas on Federal buildings or land may not contain any advertising.
<br>
<br>(c) Federal property does not include lands held by the United States in trust for individual or Native American tribal governments.
<br>
<br>(d) Agencies shall retain discretion to reject inappropriate siting requests, and assure adequate protection of public property and timely removal of equipment and structures at the end of service.
<br>
<br>2. All procedures and mechanisms adopted regarding access to Federal property shall be clear and simple so as to facilitate the efficient and rapid buildout of the national wireless communications infrastructure.
<br>
<br>3. Unless otherwise prohibited by or inconsistent with Federal law, agencies shall charge fees based on market value for siting antennas on Federal property, and may use competitive procedures if not all applicants can be accommodated.
<br>
<br>This memorandum does not give the siting of mobile services antennas priority over other authorized uses of Federal buildings or land.
<br>
<br>All independent regulatory commissions and agencies are requested to comply with the provisions of this memorandum.
<br>
<br>This memorandum is not intended to create any right, benefit or trust responsibility, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity by a party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers, or any other person.
<br>
<br>This memorandum shall be published in the Federal Register.
<br>
<br>William J. Clinton.      
<br>§582. Management of buildings by Administrator of General Services
<br>
<br>(a) Request by Federal Agency or Instrumentality.—At the request of a federal agency, a mixed-ownership Government corporation (as defined in chapter 91 of title 31), or the District of Columbia, the Administrator of General Services may operate, maintain, and protect a building that is owned by the Federal Government (or, in the case of a wholly owned or mixed-ownership Government corporation, by the corporation) and occupied by the agency or instrumentality making the request.
<br>
<br>(b) Transfer of Functions by Director of the Office of Management and Budget.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—When the Director of the Office of Management and Budget determines that it is in the interest of economy or efficiency, the Director shall transfer to the Administrator all functions vested in a federal agency with respect to the operation, maintenance, and custody of an office building owned by the Government or a wholly owned Government corporation, or an office building, or part of an office building, that is occupied by a federal agency under a lease.
<br>
<br>(2) Exception for post-office buildings.—A transfer of functions shall not be made under this subsection for a post-office building, unless the Director determines that the building is not used predominantly for post-office purposes. The Administrator may delegate functions with respect to a post-office building that are transferred to the Administrator under this subsection only to another officer or employee of the General Services Administration or to the Postmaster General.
<br>
<br>(3) Exception for buildings in a foreign country.—A transfer of functions shall not be made under this subsection for a building located in a foreign country.
<br>
<br>(4) Exception for department of defense buildings.—A transfer of functions shall not be made under this subsection for a building located on the grounds of a facility of the Department of Defense (including a fort, camp, post, arsenal, navy yard, naval training station, airfield, proving ground, military supply depot, or school) unless and only to the extent that the Secretary of Defense has issued a permit for use by another agency.
<br>
<br>(5) Exception for groups of special purpose buildings.—A transfer of functions shall not be made under this subsection for a building that the Director finds to be a part of a group of buildings that are—
<br>
<br>(A) located in the same vicinity;
<br>
<br>(B) used wholly or predominantly for the special purposes of the agency with custody of the buildings; and
<br>
<br>(C) not generally suitable for use by another agency.
<br>
<br>(6) Exception for certain government buildings.—A transfer of functions shall not be made under this subsection for the Treasury Building, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing Building, the buildings occupied by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the buildings under the jurisdiction of the regents of the Smithsonian Institution.

Section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970, was repealed by section 5(b) of the Act of September 13, 1982 (Public Law 97–258, 96 Stat. 1085), the first section of which enacted Title 31, United States Code, but the successor provision, 31:502, continued the designation as Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
<br>§583. Construction of buildings
<br>
<br>(a) Authority.—At the request of a federal agency, a mixed-ownership Government corporation (as defined in chapter 91 of title 31), or the District of Columbia, the Administrator of General Services may—
<br>
<br>(1) acquire land for a building or project authorized by Congress;
<br>
<br>(2) make or cause to be made (under contract or otherwise) surveys and test borings and prepare plans and specifications for a building or project prior to the Attorney General's approval of the title to the site; and
<br>
<br>(3) contract for, and supervise, the construction, development, and equipping of a building or project.
<br>
<br>(b) Transfer of Amounts.—An amount available to a federal agency or instrumentality for a building or project may be transferred, in advance, to the General Services Administration for purposes the Administrator determines are necessary, including payment of salaries and expenses for preparing plans and specifications and for field supervision.

<br>
<br>In subsection (a), the words "mixed-ownership Government corporation" are substituted for "mixed-ownership corporation" for consistency in the subsection and with chapter 91 of title 31. The words "chapter 91 of title 31" are substituted for "the Government Corporation Control Act" in section 210(c) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 because of section 4(b) of the Act of September 13, 1982 (Public Law 97–258, 96 Stat. 1067), the first section of which enacted Title 31, United States Code.

<br>§584. Assignment and reassignment of space
<br>
<br>(a) Authority.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—Subject to paragraph (2), the Administrator of General Services may assign or reassign space for an executive agency in any Federal Government-owned or leased building.
<br>
<br>(2) Requirements.—The Administrator's authority under paragraph (1) may be exercised only—
<br>
<br>(A) in accordance with policies and directives the President prescribes under section 121(a) of this title;
<br>
<br>(B) after consultation with the head of the executive agency affected; and
<br>
<br>(C) on a determination by the Administrator that the assignment or reassignment is advantageous to the Government in terms of economy, efficiency, or national security.
<br>
<br>(b) Priority for Public Access.—In assigning space on a major pedestrian access level (other than space leased under section 581(h)(1) or (2) of this title), the Administrator shall, where practicable, give priority to federal activities requiring regular contact with the public. If the space is not available, the Administrator shall provide space with maximum ease of access to building entrances.

<br>
<br>Ex. Ord. No. 12411, Mar. 29, 1983, 48 F.R. 13391, provided:
<br>
<br>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America, including Section 486 of Title 40 of the United States Code [now 40 U.S.C. 121], in order to institute fundamental changes in the manner in which Federal work space is managed to ensure its efficient utilization, it is hereby ordered as follows:
<br>
<br>Section 1. In order to make the Federal use of work space (including office space, warehouses and special purpose space, whether federally owned, leased or controlled) and related furnishings more effective in support of agency missions, minimize the acquisition of government resources, and reduce the administrative costs of the Federal government, the heads of all Federal Executive agencies shall:
<br>
<br>(a) Establish programs to reduce the amount of work space, used or held, to that amount which is essential for known agency missions;
<br>
<br>(b) Produce and maintain a total inventory of work space and related furnishings and declare excess to the Administrator of General Services all such holdings that are not necessary to satisfy existing or known and verified planned programs;
<br>
<br>(c) Ensure that the amount of office space used by each employee of the agency, or others using agency-controlled space, is held to the minimum necessary to accomplish the task that must be performed;
<br>
<br>(d) Manage the furniture, equipment, decoration, drapes, carpeting, plants and other accoutrements so that the use of all furnishings by the agency reflects a judicious employment of public moneys;
<br>
<br>(e) Consider, in making decisions concerning the use, acquisition, or disposal of work space and related furnishings, the effects of its actions on costs incurred by other Federal agencies;
<br>
<br>(f) Report all vacant work space retained for future Federal uses to the Administrator of General Services so that it may be made available for the temporary use of other Federal agencies, to the extent consistent with national defense requirements;
<br>
<br>(g) Establish a work space management plan to meet the provisions of this Order, including specification of the goals to be achieved and actions to be taken by the agency in order to improve its utilization of all work space and related furnishings; and
<br>
<br>(h) Establish information systems, implement inventory controls and conduct surveys, in accordance with procedures established by the Administrator of General Services, so that a government-wide reporting system may be developed.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. The Administrator of General Services is delegated authority, to the extent not prohibited by other laws, to conduct surveys, establish agency-wide objectives for work space use for each Executive agency, and establish procedures, guidelines and regulations to be followed by the agencies in developing the work space planning, information and reporting systems required by this Order.

<br>§585. Lease agreements
<br>
<br>(a) In General.—
<br>
<br>(1) Authority.—The Administrator of General Services may enter into a lease agreement with a person, copartnership, corporation, or other public or private entity for the accommodation of a federal agency in a building (or improvement) which is in existence or being erected by the lessor to accommodate the federal agency. The Administrator may assign and reassign the leased space to a federal agency.
<br>
<br>(2) Terms.—A lease agreement under this subsection shall be on terms the Administrator considers to be in the interest of the Federal Government and necessary for the accommodation of the federal agency. However, the lease agreement may not bind the Government for more than 20 years and the obligation of amounts for a lease under this subsection is limited to the current fiscal year for which payments are due without regard to section 1341(a)(1)(B) of title 31.
<br>
<br>(b) Sublease.—
<br>
<br>(1) Application.—This subsection applies to rent received if the Administrator—
<br>
<br>(A) determines that an unexpired portion of a lease of space to the Government is surplus property; and
<br>
<br>(B) disposes of the property by sublease.
<br>
<br>(2) Use of rent.—Notwithstanding section 571(a) of this title, the Administrator may deposit rent received into the Federal Buildings Fund. The Administrator may defray from the fund any costs necessary to provide services to the Government's lessee and to pay the rent (not otherwise provided for) on the lease of the space to the Government.
<br>
<br>(c) Amounts for Rent Available for Lease of Buildings on Government Land.—Amounts made available to the General Services Administration for the payment of rent may be used to lease space, for a period of not more than 30 years, in buildings erected on land owned by the Government.

<br>"(a) Short Title.—This Act may be cited as the 'Secure Federal Leases from Espionage And Suspicious Entanglements Act' or the 'Secure Federal LEASEs Act'.

<br>
<br>"(3) the General Services Administration and Federal agencies with leasing authority may not know if foreign owners have a stake in the buildings leased by the agencies, either through foreign-incorporated legal entities or through ownership in United States-incorporated legal entities, even when the leased space is used for classified operations or to store sensitive data; and
<br>
<br>"(4) according to a report of the Government Accountability Office, dated January 2017, that examined the risks of foreign ownership of Government-leased real estate, 'leasing space in foreign-owned buildings could present security risks such as espionage and unauthorized cyber and physical access'.

<br>§586. Charges for space and services
<br>
<br>(a) Definition.—In this section, "space and services" means space, services, quarters, maintenance, repair, and other facilities.
<br>
<br>(b) Charges by Administrator of General Services.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—The Administrator of General Services shall impose a charge for furnishing space and services.
<br>
<br>(2) Rates.—The Administrator shall, from time to time, determine the rates to be charged for furnishing space and services and shall prescribe regulations providing for the rates. The rates shall approximate commercial charges for comparable space and services. However, for a building for which the Administrator is responsible for alterations only (as the term "alter" is defined in section 3301(a) of this title), the rates shall be fixed to recover only the approximate cost incurred in providing alterations.
<br>
<br>(3) Exemptions.—The Administrator may exempt anyone from the charges required by this subsection when the Administrator determines that charges would be infeasible or impractical.

<br>
<br>(1) In general.—An executive agency, other than the Administration, may impose a charge for furnishing space and services at rates approved by the Administrator.

<br>
<br>(d) Rent Payments for Lease Space.—An agency may make rent payments to the Administration for lease space relating to expansion needs of the agency.

<br>
<br>In subsection (b)(3), the words "Federal Buildings Fund" are substituted for "the fund" for clarity and to execute the probable intent of Congress. Sections 3 and 4 of the Public Buildings Amendments of 1972 (Public Law 92–313, 86 Stat. 218) added subsection (j) of 40:490 (in which the words "the fund" appear) and amended subsection (f) to create a fund into which "charges made pursuant to subsection (j)" are deposited (40:490(f)(1)(A)). That fund was subsequently named "Federal Buildings Fund" by section 153(1) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Public Law 102–486, 106 Stat. 2851). If an exemption from charges is granted under 40:490(j), "the fund" that suffers the loss of revenue is the Federal Buildings Fund.
<br>
<br>In subsection (d), the words "on and after October 6, 1992" are omitted as obsolete. The words "subsection (b)" are substituted for "section 201(j) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended (40 U.S.C. 490(j))" in section 5(a) of the Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 1993, to reflect the probable intent of Congress. Section 201 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 does not contain a subsection (j) and the intended reference was probably "section 210(j)", which is restated in this section. The text of 40:490f(b) is omitted as executed.
<br>§587. Telecommuting and other alternative workplace arrangements
<br>
<br>(a) Definition.—In this section, the term "telecommuting centers" means flexiplace work telecommuting centers.
<br>
<br>(b) Telecommuting Centers Established by Administrator of General Services.—
<br>
<br>(1) Establishment.—The Administrator of General Services may acquire space for, establish, and equip telecommuting centers for use in accordance with this subsection.
<br>
<br>(2) Use.—A telecommuting center may be used by employees of federal agencies, state and local governments, and the private sector. The Administrator shall give federal employees priority in using a telecommuting center. The Administrator may make a telecommuting center available for use by others to the extent it is not fully utilized by federal employees.
