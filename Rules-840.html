<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§420a–420e–1 (June 18, 1934, ch. 569, §§1–6, 48 Stat. 979, 980; July 3, 1946, ch. 537, 60 Stat. 420).
<br>
<br>Section consolidates sections 420a to 420e–1 of Title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with changes in phraseology and arrangement necessary to effect consolidation.
<br>
<br>Provisions designating offense as felony were omitted as unnecessary in view of definitive section 1 of this title. (See reviser's note under section 550 of this title.)
<br>
<br>Subsection (c) of the revised section is derived from title II of the 1946 amendment. It substitutes references to specific sections of the United States Code, 1940 ed., in place of references to numerous acts of Congress, in conformity to the style of the revision bill. Subsection (c) as rephrased will preclude any construction of implied repeal of the specified acts of Congress codified in the sections enumerated.
<br>
<br>The words "attempts or conspires so to do" were substituted for sections 3 and 4 of the 1946 act, omitting as unnecessary the words "participates in an attempt" and the words "or acts in concert with another or with others", in view of section 2 of this title which makes any person who participates in an unlawful enterprise or aids or assists the principal offender, or does anything towards the accomplishment of the crime, a principal himself.
<br>
<br>Words "shall, upon conviction thereof," were omitted as surplusage, since punishment cannot be imposed until a conviction is secured.
