<br>§379j–21. Authority to assess and use generic new animal drug fees
<br>(a) Types of fees
<br>
<br>Beginning with respect to fiscal year 2009, the Secretary shall assess and collect fees in accordance with this section as follows:
<br>(1) Abbreviated application fee
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Each person that submits, on or after July 1, 2008, an abbreviated application for a generic new animal drug shall be subject to a fee as established in subsection (c) for such an application.
<br>(B) Payment
<br>
<br>The fee required by subparagraph (A) shall be due upon submission of the abbreviated application.
<br>(C) Exceptions
<br>(i) Previously filed application
<br>
<br>If an abbreviated application was submitted by a person that paid the fee for such application, was accepted for filing, and was not approved or was withdrawn (without a waiver or refund), the submission of an abbreviated application for the same product by the same person (or the person's licensee, assignee, or successor) shall not be subject to a fee under subparagraph (A).
<br>(ii) Certain abbreviated applications involving combination animal drugs
<br>
<br>An abbreviated application which is subject to the criteria in section 360b(d)(4) of this title and submitted on or after October 1, 2013 shall be subject to a fee equal to 50 percent of the amount of the abbreviated application fee established in subsection (c).
<br>(D) Refund of fee if application refused for filing
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall refund 75 percent of the fee paid under subparagraph (B) for any abbreviated application which is refused for filing.
<br>(E) Refund of fee if application withdrawn
<br>
<br>If an abbreviated application is withdrawn after the application was filed, the Secretary may refund the fee or portion of the fee paid under subparagraph (B) if no substantial work was performed on the application after the application was filed. The Secretary shall have the sole discretion to refund the fee under this subparagraph. A determination by the Secretary concerning a refund under this subparagraph shall not be reviewable.
<br>(2) Generic new animal drug product fee
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Each person—
<br>
<br>(i) who is named as the applicant in an abbreviated application or supplemental abbreviated application for a generic new animal drug product which has been submitted for listing under section 360 of this title; and
<br>
<br>(ii) who, after September 1, 2008, had pending before the Secretary an abbreviated application or supplemental abbreviated application,
<br>
<br>shall pay for each such generic new animal drug product the annual fee established in subsection (c).
<br>(B) Payment; fee due date
<br>
<br>Such fee shall be payable for the fiscal year in which the generic new animal drug product is first submitted for listing under section 360 of this title, or is submitted for relisting under section 360 of this title if the generic new animal drug product has been withdrawn from listing and relisted. After such fee is paid for that fiscal year, such fee shall be due each subsequent fiscal year that the product remains listed, upon the later of—
<br>
<br>(i) the first business day after the date of enactment of an appropriations Act providing for the collection and obligation of fees for such fiscal year under this section; or
<br>
<br>(ii) January 31 of each year.
<br>(C) Limitation
<br>
<br>Such fee shall be paid only once for each generic new animal drug product for a fiscal year in which the fee is payable.
<br>(3) Generic new animal drug sponsor fee
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Each person—
<br>
<br>(i) who meets the definition of a generic new animal drug sponsor within a fiscal year; and
<br>
<br>(ii) who, after September 1, 2008, had pending before the Secretary an abbreviated application, a supplemental abbreviated application, or an investigational submission,

<br>(C) Amount of fee
<br>
<br>Each generic new animal drug sponsor shall pay only 1 such fee each fiscal year, as follows:
<br>
<br>(i) 100 percent of the amount of the generic new animal drug sponsor fee published for that fiscal year under subsection (c) for an applicant with more than 6 approved abbreviated applications.
<br>
<br>(ii) 75 percent of the amount of the generic new animal drug sponsor fee published for that fiscal year under subsection (c) for an applicant with more than 1 and fewer than 7 approved abbreviated applications.
<br>
<br>(iii) 50 percent of the amount of the generic new animal drug sponsor fee published for that fiscal year under subsection (c) for an applicant with 1 or fewer approved abbreviated applications.
<br>(b) Fee revenue amounts
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Subject to subsections (c), (d), (f), and (g), for each of fiscal years 2019 through 2023, the fees required under subsection (a) shall be established to generate a total revenue amount of $18,336,340.
<br>(2) Types of fees
<br>
<br>Of the total revenue amount established for a fiscal year under paragraph (1)—
<br>
<br>(A) 25 percent shall be derived from fees under subsection (a)(1) (relating to abbreviated applications for a generic new animal drug);
<br>
<br>(B) 37.5 percent shall be derived from fees under subsection (a)(2) (relating to generic new animal drug products); and
<br>
<br>(C) 37.5 percent shall be derived from fees under subsection (a)(3) (relating to generic new animal drug sponsors).
<br>(c) Annual fee setting; adjustments
<br>(1) Annual fee setting
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall establish, 60 days before the start of each fiscal year beginning after September 30, 2008, for that fiscal year, abbreviated application fees, generic new animal drug sponsor fees, and generic new animal drug product fees, based on the revenue amounts established under subsection (b) and the adjustments provided under this subsection.
<br>(2) Inflation adjustment
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>For fiscal year 2020 and subsequent fiscal years, the revenue amounts established under subsection (b) shall be adjusted by the Secretary by notice, published in the Federal Register, for a fiscal year, by multiplying such revenue amounts by an amount equal to the sum of—
<br>
<br>(i) one;
<br>
<br>(ii) the average annual percent change in the cost, per full-time equivalent position of the Food and Drug Administration, of all personnel compensation and benefits paid with respect to such positions for the first 3 of the preceding 4 fiscal years for which data are available, multiplied by the average proportion of personnel compensation and benefits costs to total Food and Drug Administration costs for the first 3 of the preceding 4 fiscal years for which data are available; and
<br>
<br>(iii) the average annual percent change that occurred in the Consumer Price Index for urban consumers (Washington-Baltimore, DC–MD–VA–WV; not seasonally adjusted; all items less food and energy; annual index) for the first 3 of the preceding 4 years for which data are available multiplied by the average proportion of all costs other than personnel compensation and benefits costs to total Food and Drug Administration costs for the first 3 of the preceding 4 fiscal years for which data are available.
<br>(B) Compounded basis
<br>
<br>The adjustment made each fiscal year after fiscal year 2020 under this paragraph shall be applied on a compounded basis to the revenue amount calculated under this paragraph for the most recent previous fiscal year.
<br>(3) Workload adjustments
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>For fiscal year 2020 and subsequent fiscal years, after the fee revenue amounts established under subsection (b) are adjusted for inflation in accordance with paragraph (2), the fee revenue amounts shall be further adjusted for each such fiscal year to reflect changes in the workload of the Secretary for the process for the review of abbreviated applications for generic new animal drugs, subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C). With respect to such adjustment—
<br>
<br>(i) this adjustment shall be determined by the Secretary based on a weighted average of the change in the total number of abbreviated applications for generic new animal drugs, manufacturing supplemental abbreviated applications for generic new animal drugs, investigational generic new animal drug study submissions, and investigational generic new animal drug protocol submissions submitted to the Secretary; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register the fees resulting from this adjustment and the supporting methodologies.
<br>(B) Reduction of workload-based increase by amount of certain excess collections
<br>
<br>For each of fiscal years 2021 through 2023, if application of the workload adjustment under subparagraph (A) increases the fee revenue amounts otherwise established for the fiscal year under subsection (b), as adjusted for inflation under paragraph (2), such fee revenue increase shall be reduced by the amount of any excess collections, as described in subsection (g)(4), for the second preceding fiscal year, up to the amount of such fee revenue increase.
<br>(C) Rule of application
<br>
<br>Under no circumstances shall workload adjustments under this paragraph result in fee revenues for a fiscal year that are less than the fee revenues for that fiscal year established under subsection (b), as adjusted for inflation under paragraph (2).
<br>(4) Final year adjustment
<br>
<br>For fiscal year 2023, the Secretary may, in addition to other adjustments under this subsection, further increase the fees under this section, if such an adjustment is necessary, to provide for up to 3 months of operating reserves of carryover user fees for the process for the review of abbreviated applications for generic new animal drugs for the first 3 months of fiscal year 2024. If the Food and Drug Administration has carryover balances for the process for the review of abbreviated applications for generic new animal drugs in excess of 3 months of such operating reserves, then this adjustment shall not be made. If this adjustment is necessary, then the rationale for the amount of the increase shall be contained in the annual notice setting fees for fiscal year 2023.
<br>(5) Limit
<br>
<br>The total amount of fees charged, as adjusted under this subsection, for a fiscal year may not exceed the total costs for such fiscal year for the resources allocated for the process for the review of abbreviated applications for generic new animal drugs.
<br>(d) Fee waiver or reduction; exemption from fees
<br>(1) Fee waiver or reduction
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall grant a waiver from or a reduction of one or more fees assessed under subsection (a) where the Secretary finds that the generic new animal drug is intended solely to provide for a minor use or minor species indication.
<br>(2) Exemption from fees
<br>
<br>Fees under this section shall not apply with respect to any person who—
<br>
<br>(A) not later than September 30, 2023, submits a supplemental abbreviated application for a generic new animal drug approved under section 360b of this title, solely to add the application number to the labeling of the drug in the manner specified in section 352(w)(3) of this title; and
<br>
<br>(B) otherwise would be subject to fees under this section solely on the basis of such supplemental abbreviated application.
<br>(e) Effect of failure to pay fees
<br>
<br>An abbreviated application for a generic new animal drug submitted by a person subject to fees under subsection (a) shall be considered incomplete and shall not be accepted for filing by the Secretary until all fees owed by such person have been paid. An investigational submission for a generic new animal drug that is submitted by a person subject to fees under subsection (a) shall be considered incomplete and shall not be accepted for review by the Secretary until all fees owed by such person have been paid. The Secretary may discontinue review of any abbreviated application for a generic new animal drug, supplemental abbreviated application for a generic new animal drug, or investigational submission for a generic new animal drug from a person if such person has not submitted for payment all fees owed under this section by 30 days after the date upon which they are due.
<br>(f) Assessment of fees
<br>(1) Limitation
<br>
<br>Fees may not be assessed under subsection (a) for a fiscal year beginning after fiscal year 2008 unless appropriations for salaries and expenses of the Food and Drug Administration for such fiscal year (excluding the amount of fees appropriated for such fiscal year) are equal to or greater than the amount of appropriations for the salaries and expenses of the Food and Drug Administration for the fiscal year 2003 (excluding the amount of fees appropriated for such fiscal year) multiplied by the adjustment factor applicable to the fiscal year involved.
<br>(2) Authority
<br>
<br>If the Secretary does not assess fees under subsection (a) during any portion of a fiscal year because of paragraph (1) and if at a later date in such fiscal year the Secretary may assess such fees, the Secretary may assess and collect such fees, without any modification in the rate, for abbreviated applications, generic new animal drug sponsors, and generic new animal drug products at any time in such fiscal year notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) relating to the date fees are to be paid.
<br>(g) Crediting and availability of fees
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Subject to paragraph (2)(C), fees authorized under subsection (a) shall be collected and available for obligation only to the extent and in the amount provided in advance in appropriations Acts. Such fees are authorized to be appropriated to remain available until expended. Such sums as may be necessary may be transferred from the Food and Drug Administration salaries and expenses appropriation account without fiscal year limitation to such appropriation account for salary and expenses with such fiscal year limitation. The sums transferred shall be available solely for the process for the review of abbreviated applications for generic new animal drugs.
<br>(2) Collections and appropriation Acts
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The fees authorized by this section—
<br>
<br>(i) subject to subparagraph (C), shall be collected and available in each fiscal year in an amount not to exceed the amount specified in appropriation Acts, or otherwise made available for obligation for such fiscal year; and
<br>
<br>(ii) shall be available to defray increases in the costs of the resources allocated for the process for the review of abbreviated applications for generic new animal drugs (including increases in such costs for an additional number of full-time equivalent positions in the Department of Health and Human Services to be engaged in such process) over such costs, excluding costs paid from fees collected under this section, for fiscal year 2008 multiplied by the adjustment factor.
<br>(B) Compliance
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall be considered to have met the requirements of subparagraph (A)(ii) in any fiscal year if the costs funded by appropriations and allocated for the process for the review of abbreviated applications for generic new animal drugs—
<br>
<br>(i) are not more than 3 percent below the level specified in subparagraph (A)(ii); or
<br>
<br>(ii)(I) are more than 3 percent below the level specified in subparagraph (A)(ii), and fees assessed for the fiscal year following the subsequent fiscal year are decreased by the amount in excess of 3 percent by which such costs fell below the level specified in subparagraph (A)(ii); and
<br>
<br>(II) such costs are not more than 5 percent below the level specified in subparagraph (A)(ii).
<br>(C) Provision for early payments
<br>
<br>Payment of fees authorized under this section for a fiscal year, prior to the due date for such fees, may be accepted by the Secretary in accordance with authority provided in advance in a prior year appropriations Act.
<br>(3) Authorization of appropriations
<br>
<br>For each of the fiscal years 2019 through 2023, there is authorized to be appropriated for fees under this section an amount equal to the total revenue amount established under subsection (b) for the fiscal year, as adjusted or otherwise affected under subsection (c).
<br>(4) 1 Excess collections
<br>
<br>If the sum total of fees collected under this section for a fiscal year exceeds the amount of fees authorized to be appropriated for such year under paragraph (3), the excess collections shall be credited to the appropriations account of the Food and Drug Administration as provided in paragraph (1).
<br>(4) 1 Offset
<br>
<br>If the sum of the cumulative amount of fees collected under this section for the fiscal years 2014 through 2016 and the amount of fees estimated to be collected under this section for fiscal year 2017 exceeds the cumulative amount appropriated under paragraph (3) for the fiscal years 2014 through 2017, the excess amount shall be credited to the appropriation account of the Food and Drug Administration as provided in paragraph (1), and shall be subtracted from the amount of fees that would otherwise be authorized to be collected under this section pursuant to appropriation Acts for fiscal year 2018.
<br>(h) Collection of unpaid fees
<br>
<br>In any case where the Secretary does not receive payment of a fee assessed under subsection (a) within 30 days after it is due, such fee shall be treated as a claim of the United States Government subject to subchapter II of chapter 37 of title 31.
<br>(i) Written requests for waivers, reductions, and refunds
<br>
<br>To qualify for consideration for a waiver or reduction under subsection (d), or for a refund of any fee collected in accordance with subsection (a), a person shall submit to the Secretary a written request for such waiver, reduction, or refund not later than 180 days after such fee is due.
<br>(j) Construction
<br>
<br>This section may not be construed to require that the number of full-time equivalent positions in the Department of Health and Human Services, for officers, employees, and advisory committees not engaged in the process of the review of abbreviated applications for generic new animal drugs, be reduced to offset the number of officers, employees, and advisory committees so engaged.

<br>
<br>(A) the responsible party for each domestic facility (as defined in section 350d(b) of this title) and the United States agent for each foreign facility subject to a reinspection in such fiscal year, to cover reinspection-related costs for such year;
<br>
<br>(B) the responsible party for a domestic facility (as defined in section 350d(b) of this title) and an importer who does not comply with a recall order under section 350l of this title or under section 350a(f) of this title in such fiscal year, to cover food recall activities associated with such order performed by the Secretary, including technical assistance, follow-up effectiveness checks, and public notifications, for such year;
<br>
<br>(C) each importer participating in the voluntary qualified importer program under section 384b of this title in such year, to cover the administrative costs of such program for such year; and
<br>
<br>(D) each importer subject to a reinspection in such fiscal year, to cover reinspection-related costs for such year.
<br>(2) Definitions
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section—
<br>
<br>(A) the term "reinspection" means—
<br>
<br>(i) with respect to domestic facilities (as defined in section 350d(b) of this title), 1 or more inspections conducted under section 374 of this title subsequent to an inspection conducted under such provision which identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of this chapter, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved to the Secretary's satisfaction; and
<br>
<br>(ii) with respect to importers, 1 or more examinations conducted under section 381 of this title subsequent to an examination conducted under such provision which identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of this chapter, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved to the Secretary's satisfaction;
<br>
<br>(B) the term "reinspection-related costs" means all expenses, including administrative expenses, incurred in connection with—
<br>
<br>(i) arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of reinspections; and
<br>
<br>(ii) assessing and collecting reinspection fees under this section; and
<br>
<br>(C) the term "responsible party" has the meaning given such term in section 350f(a)(1) of this title.
<br>(b) Establishment of fees
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Subject to subsections (c) and (d), the Secretary shall establish the fees to be collected under this section for each fiscal year specified in subsection (a)(1), based on the methodology described under paragraph (2), and shall publish such fees in a Federal Register notice not later than 60 days before the start of each such year.
<br>(2) Fee methodology
<br>(A) Fees
<br>
<br>Fees amounts established for collection—
<br>
<br>(i) under subparagraph (A) of subsection (a)(1) for a fiscal year shall be based on the Secretary's estimate of 100 percent of the costs of the reinspection-related activities (including by type or level of reinspection activity, as the Secretary determines applicable) described in such subparagraph (A) for such year;
<br>
<br>(ii) under subparagraph (B) of subsection (a)(1) for a fiscal year shall be based on the Secretary's estimate of 100 percent of the costs of the activities described in such subparagraph (B) for such year;
<br>
<br>(iii) under subparagraph (C) of subsection (a)(1) for a fiscal year shall be based on the Secretary's estimate of 100 percent of the costs of the activities described in such subparagraph (C) for such year; and

<br>
<br>In establishing the fee amounts under subparagraph (A)(iii) for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall provide for the number of importers who have submitted to the Secretary a notice under section 384b(c) of this title informing the Secretary of the intent of such importer to participate in the program under section 384b of this title in such fiscal year.
<br>(II) 1 Recoupment
<br>
<br>In establishing the fee amounts under subparagraph (A)(iii) for the first 5 fiscal years after January 4, 2011, the Secretary shall include in such fee a reasonable surcharge that provides a recoupment of the costs expended by the Secretary to establish and implement the first year of the program under section 384b of this title.
<br>(ii) Crediting of fees
<br>
<br>In establishing the fee amounts under subparagraph (A) for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall provide for the crediting of fees from the previous year to the next year if the Secretary overestimated the amount of fees needed to carry out such activities, and consider the need to account for any adjustment of fees and such other factors as the Secretary determines appropriate.
<br>(iii) Published guidelines
<br>
<br>Not later than 180 days after January 4, 2011, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a proposed set of guidelines in consideration of the burden of fee amounts on small business. Such consideration may include reduced fee amounts for small businesses. The Secretary shall provide for a period of public comment on such guidelines. The Secretary shall adjust the fee schedule for small businesses subject to such fees only through notice and comment rulemaking.
<br>(3) Use of fees
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall make all of the fees collected pursuant to clause 2 (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) of paragraph (2)(A) available solely to pay for the costs referred to in such clause (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) of paragraph (2)(A), respectively.
<br>(c) Limitations

<br>
<br>Fees under subsection (a) shall be refunded for a fiscal year beginning after fiscal year 2010 unless the amount of the total appropriations for food safety activities at the Food and Drug Administration for such fiscal year (excluding the amount of fees appropriated for such fiscal year) is equal to or greater than the amount of appropriations for food safety activities at the Food and Drug Administration for fiscal year 2009 (excluding the amount of fees appropriated for such fiscal year), multiplied by the adjustment factor under paragraph (3).
<br>(2) Authority
<br>
<br>If—
<br>
<br>(A) the Secretary does not assess fees under subsection (a) for a portion of a fiscal year because paragraph (1) applies; and
<br>
<br>(B) at a later date in such fiscal year, such paragraph (1) ceases to apply,
<br>
<br>the Secretary may assess and collect such fees under subsection (a), without any modification to the rate of such fees, notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) relating to the date fees are to be paid.
<br>(3) Adjustment factor
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The adjustment factor described in paragraph (1) shall be the total percentage change that occurred in the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers (all items; United States city average) for the 12-month period ending June 30 preceding the fiscal year, but in no case shall such adjustment factor be negative.
<br>(B) Compounded basis
<br>
<br>The adjustment under subparagraph (A) made each fiscal year shall be added on a compounded basis to the sum of all adjustments made each fiscal year after fiscal year 2009.
<br>(4) Limitation on amount of certain fees
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of this section and subject to subparagraph (B), the Secretary may not collect fees in a fiscal year such that the amount collected—
<br>
<br>(i) under subparagraph (B) of subsection (a)(1) exceeds $20,000,000; and
<br>
<br>(ii) under subparagraphs (A) and (D) of subsection (a)(1) exceeds $25,000,000 combined.
<br>(B) Exception
<br>
<br>If a domestic facility (as defined in section 350d(b) of this title) or an importer becomes subject to a fee described in subparagraph (A), (B), or (D) of subsection (a)(1) after the maximum amount of fees has been collected by the Secretary under subparagraph (A), the Secretary may collect a fee from such facility or importer.
<br>(d) Crediting and availability of fees
<br>
<br>Fees authorized under subsection (a) shall be collected and available for obligation only to the extent and in the amount provided in appropriations Acts. Such fees are authorized to remain available until expended. Such sums as may be necessary may be transferred from the Food and Drug Administration salaries and expenses account without fiscal year limitation to such appropriation account for salaries and expenses with such fiscal year limitation. The sums transferred shall be available solely for the purpose of paying the operating expenses of the Food and Drug Administration employees and contractors performing activities associated with these food safety fees.
<br>(e) Collection of fees
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall specify in the Federal Register notice described in subsection (b)(1) the time and manner in which fees assessed under this section shall be collected.
<br>(2) Collection of unpaid fees
<br>
<br>In any case where the Secretary does not receive payment of a fee assessed under this section within 30 days after it is due, such fee shall be treated as a claim of the United States Government subject to provisions of subchapter II of chapter 37 of title 31.
<br>(f) Annual report to Congress
<br>
<br>Not later than 120 days after each fiscal year for which fees are assessed under this section, the Secretary shall submit a report to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives, to include a description of fees assessed and collected for each such year and a summary description of the entities paying such fees and the types of business in which such entities engage.
<br>(g) Authorization of appropriations
<br>
<br>For fiscal year 2010 and each fiscal year thereafter, there is authorized to be appropriated for fees under this section an amount equal to the total revenue amount determined under subsection (b) for the fiscal year, as adjusted or otherwise affected under the other provisions of this section.
