<br>16	Wheresoever they went in without bow and arrow, and without shield and sword, their God fought for them and overcame.
<br>17	And there was no one that triumphed over this people, but when they departed from the worship of the Lord their God.
<br>18	But as often as beside their own God, they worshipped any other, they were given to spoil and to the sword, and to reproach.
<br>19	And as often as they were penitent for hav- ing revolted from the worship of their God, the God of heaven gave them power to resist.
<br>20	So they overthrew the king of the Chanaan- ites, and of the Jebusites, and of the Pherezites, and of the Hethites, and of the Hevites, and of the Amorrhites, and all the mighty ones in Hes- ebon, and they possessed their lands, and their
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>cities:
<br>21	And as long as they sinned not in the sight of their God, it was well with them: for their God hateth iniquity.
<br>22	And even some years ago when they had revolted from the way which God had given them to walk therein, they were destroyed in battles by many nations and very many of them were led away captive into a strange land.
<br>23	But of late returning to the Lord their God, from the different places wherein they were scat- tered, they are come together and are gone up into all these mountains, and possess Jerusalem again, where their holies are.
<br>24	Now therefore, my lord, search if there be any iniquity of theirs in the sight of their God: let us go up to them, because their God will surely deliver them to thee, and they shall be brought under the yoke of thy power:
<br>25	But if there be no offence of this people in the sight of their God, we cannot resist them because their God will defend them: and we shall be a reproach to the whole earth.
<br>26	And it came to pass, when Achior had ceased to speak these words, all the great men of Holofernes were angry, and they had a mind to kill him, saying to each other:
<br>27	Who is this, that saith the children of Israel can resist king Nabuchodonosor, and his armies, men unarmed, and without force, and without skill in the art of war?
<br>28	That Achior therefore may know that he deceiveth us, let us go up into the mountains: and when the bravest of them shall be taken, then shall he with them be stabbed with the sword,
<br>29	That every nation may know that Nabu- chodonosor is god of the earth, and besides him there is no other.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 6
<br>And it came to pass when they had left off speak- ing, that Holofernes being in a violent passion, said to Achior:
<br>2	Because thou hast prophesied unto us, say- ing: That the nation of Israel is defended by their God, to shew thee that there is no God, but Nabuchodonosor:
<br>3	When we shall slay them all as one man, then thou also shalt die with them by the sword of the Assyrians, and all Israel shall perish with thee:
<br>4	And thou shalt find that Nabuchodonosor is lord of the whole earth: and then the sword of my soldiers shall pass through thy sides, and thou shalt be stabbed and fall among the wounded of Israel, and thou shalt breathe no more till thou be destroyed with them.
<br>5	But if thou think thy prophecy true, let not thy countenance sink, and let the paleness that is in thy face, depart from thee, if thou imaginest these my words cannot be accomplished.
<br>6	And that thou mayst know that thou shalt experience these things together with them, be- hold from this hour thou shalt be associated to their people, that when they shall receive the punishment they deserve from my sword, thou mayst fall under the same vengeance.
<br>7	Then Holofernes commanded his servants to take Achior, and to lead him to Bethulia, and to deliver him into the hands of the children of Israel.
<br>8	And the servants of Holofernes taking him, went through the plains: but when they came near the mountains, the slingers came out against them.
<br>9	Then turning out of the way by the side of the mountain, they tied Achior to a tree hand and foot, and so left him bound with ropes, and
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>returned to their master.
<br>10	And the children of Israel coming down from Bethulia, came to him, and loosing him they brought him to Bethulia, and setting him in the midst of the people, asked him what was the matter that the Assyrians had left him bound.
<br>11	In those days the rulers there, were Ozias the son of Micha of the tribe of Simeon, and Charmi, called also Gothoniel.
<br>12	And Achior related in the midst of the an- cients, and in the presence of all the people, all that he had said being asked by Holofernes: and how the people of Holofernes would have killed him for this word,
<br>13	And how Holofernes himself being angry had commanded him to be delivered for this cause to the Israelites: that when he should over- come the children of Israel, then he might com- mand Achior also himself to be put to death by diverse torments, for having said: The God of heaven is their defender.
<br>14	And when Achior had declared all these things, all the people fell upon their faces, ador- ing the Lord, and all of them together mourning and weeping poured out their prayers with one accord to the Lord,
<br>15	Saying: O Lord God of heaven and earth, behold their pride, and look on our low condi- tion, and have regard to the face of thy saints, and shew that thou forsakest not them that trust on thee, and that thou humblest them that presume of themselves, and glory in their own strength.
<br>16	So when their weeping was ended, and the peopleâ€™s prayer, in which they continued all the day, was concluded, they comforted Achior,
<br>17	Saying: The God of our fathers, whose power thou hast set forth, will make this return to thee, that thou rather shalt see their destruc- tion.
<br> 
<br>18	And when the Lord our God shall give this liberty to his servants, let God be with thee also in the midst of us: that as it shall please thee, so thou with all thine mayst converse with us.
<br>19	Then Ozias, after the assembly was broken up, received him into his house, and made him a great supper.
<br>20	And all the ancients were invited, and they refreshed themselves together after their fast was over.
<br>21	And afterwards all the people were called together, and they prayed all the night long within the church, desiring help of the God of Israel.
<br>
<br>Chapter 7
<br>But Holofernes on the next day gave orders to his army, to go up against Bethulia.
<br>2	Now there were in his troops a hundred and twenty thousand footmen, and two and twenty thousand horsemen, besides the preparations of those men who had been taken, and who had been brought away out of the provinces and cities of all the youth.
<br>3	All these prepared themselves together to fight against the children of Israel, and they came by the hillside to the top, which looketh toward Dothain, from the place which is called Belma, unto Chelmon, which is over against Esdrelon.
<br>4	But the children of Israel, when they saw the multitude of them, prostrated themselves upon the ground, putting ashes upon their heads, praying with one accord, that the God of Israel would shew his mercy upon his people.
<br>5	And taking their arms of war, they posted themselves at the places, which by a narrow pathway lead directly between the mountains, and they guarded them all day and night.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>6	Now Holofernes, in going round about, found that the fountain which supplied them with water, ran through an aqueduct without the city on the south side: and he commanded their aqueduct to be cut off.
<br>7	Nevertheless there were springs not far from the walls, out of which they were seen secretly to draw water, to refresh themselves a little rather than to drink their fill.
<br>8	But the children of Ammon and Moab came to Holofernes, saying: The children of Israel trust not in their spears, nor in their arrows, but the mountains are their defence, and the steep hills and precipices guard them.
<br>9	Wherefore that thou mayst overcome them without joining battle, set guards at the springs that they may not draw water out of them, and thou shalt destroy them without sword, or at least being wearied out they will yield up their city, which they suppose, because it is situate in the mountains, to be impregnable.
<br>10	And these words pleased Holofernes, and his officers, and he placed all round about a hun- dred men at every spring.
<br>11	And when they had kept this watch for full twenty days, the cisterns, and the reserve of wa- ters failed among all the inhabitants of Bethulia, so that there was not within the city, enough to satisfy them, no not for one day, for water was daily given out to the people by measure.
<br>12	Then all the men and women, young men, and children, gathering themselves together to Ozias, all together with one voice,
<br>13	Said: God be judge between us and thee, for thou hast done evil against us, in that thou wouldst not speak peaceably with the Assyrians, and for this cause God hath sold us into their hands.
<br>14	And therefore there is no one to help us, while we are cast down before their eyes in thirst,
<br> 
<br>and sad destruction.
<br>15	And now assemble ye all that are in the city, that we may of our own accord yield our- selves all up to the people of Holofernes.
<br>16	For it is better, that being captives we should live and bless the Lord, than that we should die, and be a reproach to all flesh, af- ter we have seen our wives and our infants die before our eyes.
<br>17	We call to witness this day heaven and earth, and the God of our fathers, who taketh vengeance upon us according to our sins, con- juring you to deliver now the city into the hand of the army of Holofernes, that our end may be short by the edge of the sword, which is made longer by the drought of thirst.
<br>18	And when they had said these things, there was great weeping and lamentation of all in the assembly, and for many hours with one voice they cried to God, saying:
<br>19	We have sinned with our fathers, we have done unjustly, we have committed iniquity:
<br>20	Have thou mercy on us, because thou art good, or punish our iniquities by chastising us thyself, and deliver not them that trust in thee to a people that knoweth not thee,
<br>21	That they may not say among the Gentiles: Where is their God?
<br>22	And when being wearied with these cries, and tired with these weepings, they held their peace,
<br>23	Ozias rising up all in tears, said: Be of good courage, my brethren, and let us wait these five days for mercy from the Lord.
<br>24	For perhaps he will put a stop to his indig- nation, and will give glory to his own name.
<br>25	But if after five days be past there come no aid, we will do the things which you have spoken.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 8
<br>Now it came to pass, when Judith a widow had heard these words, who was the daughter of Mer- ari, the son of Idox, the son of Joseph, the son of Ozias, the son of Elai, the son of Jamnor, the son of Gedeon, the son of Raphaim, the son of Achitob, the son of Melchias, the son of Enan, the son of Nathanias, the son of Salathiel, the son of Simeon, the son of Ruben:
<br>2	And her husband was Manasses, who died in the time of the barley harvest:
<br>3	For he was standing over them that bound sheaves in the field; and the heat came upon his head, and he died in Bethulia his own city, and was buried there with his fathers.
<br>4	And Judith his relict was a widow now three years and six months.
<br>5	And she made herself a private chamber in the upper part of her house, in which she abode shut up with her maids.
<br>6	And she wore haircloth upon her loins, and fasted all the days of her life, except the sab- baths, and new moons, and the feasts of the house of Israel.
<br>7	And she was exceedingly beautiful, and her husband left her great riches, and very many ser- vants, and large possessions of herds of oxen, and flocks of sheep.
<br>8	And she was greatly renowned among all, because she feared the Lord very much, neither was there any one that spoke an ill word of her. 9 When therefore she had heard that Ozias had promised that he would deliver up the city after the fifth day, she sent to the ancients
<br>Chabri and Charmi.
<br>10	And they came to her, and she said to them: What is this word, by which Ozias hath consented to give up the city to the Assyrians, if within five days there come no aid to us?
<br> 
<br>11	And who are you that tempt the Lord?
<br>12	This is not a word that may draw down mercy, but rather that may stir up wrath, and enkindle indignation.
<br>13	You have set a time for the mercy of the Lord, and you have appointed him a day, accord- ing to your pleasure.
<br>14	But forasmuch as the Lord is patient, let us be penitent for this same thing, and with many tears let us beg his pardon:
<br>15	For God will not threaten like man, nor be inflamed to anger like the son of man.
<br>16	And therefore let us humble our souls be- fore him, and continuing in an humble spirit, in his service:
<br>17	Let us ask the Lord with tears, that accord- ing to his will so he would shew his mercy to us: that as our heart is troubled by their pride, so also we may glorify in our humility.
<br>18	For we have not followed the sins of our fathers, who forsook their God, and worshipped strange gods.
<br>19	For which crime they were given up to their enemies, to the sword, and to pillage, and to confusion: but we know no other God but him. 20 Let us humbly wait for his consolation, and the Lord our God will require our blood of the afflictions of our enemies, and he will humble all the nations that shall rise up against us, and
<br>bring them to disgrace.
<br>21	And now, brethren, as you are the ancients among the people of God, and their very soul resteth upon you: comfort their hearts by your speech, that they may be mindful how our fa- thers were tempted that they might be proved, whether they worshipped their God truly.
<br>22	They must remember how our father Abra- ham was tempted, and being proved by many tribulations, was made the friend of God.
<br>23	So Isaac, so Jacob, so Moses, and all that
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>have pleased God, passed through many tribula- tions, remaining faithful.
<br>24	But they that did not receive the trials with the fear of the Lord, but uttered their impatience and the reproach of their murmuring against the Lord,
<br>25	Were destroyed by the destroyer, and per- ished by serpents.
<br>26	As for us therefore let us not revenge our- selves for these things which we suffer.
<br>27	But esteeming these very punishments to be less than our sins deserve, let us believe that these scourges of the Lord, with which like ser- vants we are chastised, have happened for our amendment, and not for our destruction.
<br>28	And Ozias and the ancients said to her: All things which thou hast spoken are true, and there is nothing to be reprehended in thy words.
<br>29	Now therefore pray for us, for thou art a holy woman, and one fearing God.
<br>30	And Judith said to them: As you know that what I have been able to say is of God:
<br>31	So that which I intend to do prove ye if it be of God, and pray that God may strengthen my design.
<br>32	You shall stand at the gate this night, and I will go out with my maidservant: and pray ye, that as you have said, in five days the Lord may look down upon his people Israel.
<br>33	But I desire that you search not into what I am doing, and till I bring you word let nothing else be done but to pray for me to the Lord our God.
<br>34	And Ozias the prince of Juda said to her: Go in peace, and the Lord be with thee to take revenge of our enemies. So returning they de- parted.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 9
<br>And when they were gone, Judith went into her oratory: and putting on haircloth, laid ashes on her head: and falling down prostrate before the Lord, she cried to the Lord, saying:
<br>2	Lord God of my father Simeon, who gavest him a sword to execute vengeance against strangers, who had defiled by their uncleanness, and uncovered the virgin unto confusion:
<br>3	And who gavest their wives to be made a prey, and their daughters into captivity: and all their spoils to be divided to the servants, who were zealous with thy zeal: assist, I beseech thee, O Lord God, me a widow.
<br>4	For thou hast done the things of old, and hast devised one thing after another: and what thou hast designed hath been done.
<br>5	For all thy ways are prepared, and in thy providence thou hast placed thy judgments.
<br>6	Look upon the camp of the Assyrians now, as thou wast pleased to look upon the camp of the Egyptians, when they pursued armed after thy servants, trusting in their chariots, and in their horsemen, and in a multitude of warriors.
<br>7	But thou lookedst over their camp, and darkness wearied them.
<br>8	The deep held their feet, and the waters overwhelmed them.
<br>9	So may it be with these also, O Lord, who trust in their multitude, and in their chariots, and in their pikes, and in their shields, and in their arrows, and glory in their spears,
<br>10	And know not that thou art our God, who destroyest wars from the beginning, and the Lord is thy name.
<br>11	Lift up thy arm as from the beginning, and crush their power with thy power: let their power fall in their wrath, who promise themselves to vi- olate thy sanctuary, and defile the dwelling place
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>of thy name, and to beat down with their sword the horn of thy altar.
<br>12	Bring to pass, O Lord, that his pride may be cut off with his own sword.
<br>13	Let him be caught in the net of his own eyes in my regard, and do thou strike him by the graces of the words of my lips.
<br>14	Give me constancy in my mind, that I may despise him: and fortitude that I may overthrow him.
<br>15	For this will be a glorious monument for thy name, when he shall fall by the hand of a woman.
<br>16	For thy power, O Lord, is not in a mul- titude, nor is thy pleasure in the strength of horses, nor from the beginning have the proud been acceptable to thee: but the prayer of the humble and the meek hath always pleased thee. 17 O God of the heavens, creator of the wa- ters, and Lord of the whole creation, hear me a poor wretch, making supplication to thee, and
<br>presuming of thy mercy.
<br>18	Remember, O Lord, thy covenant, and put thou words in my mouth, and strengthen the res- olution in my heart, that thy house may continue in thy holiness:
<br>19	And all nations may acknowledge that thou art God, and there is no other besides thee.
<br>
<br>Chapter 10
<br>And it came to pass, when she had ceased to cry to the Lord, that she rose from the place wherein she lay prostrate before the Lord.
<br>2	And she called her maid, and going down into her house she took off her haircloth, and put away the garments of her widowhood,
<br>3	And she washed her body, and anointed her- self with the best ointment, and plaited the hair
<br> 
<br>of her head, and put a bonnet upon her head, and clothed herself with the garments of her gladness, and put sandals on her feet, and took her bracelets, and lilies, and earlets, and rings, and adorned herself with all her ornaments.
<br>4	And the Lord also gave her more beauty: be- cause all this dressing up did not proceed from sensuality, but from virtue: and therefore the Lord increased this her beauty, so that she ap- peared to all menâ€™s eyes incomparably lovely.
<br>5	And she gave to her maid a bottle of wine to carry, and a vessel of oil, and parched corn, and dry figs, and bread and cheese, and went out.
<br>6	And when they came to the gate of the city, they found Ozias, and the ancients of the city waiting.
<br>7	And when they saw her they were aston- ished, and admired her beauty exceedingly.
<br>8	But they asked her no question, only they let her pass, saying: The God of our fathers give thee grace, and may he strengthen all the coun- sel of thy heart with his power, that Jerusalem may glory in thee, and thy name may be in the number of the holy and just.
<br>9	And they that were there said, all with one voice: So be it, so be it.
<br>10	But Judith praying to the Lord, passed through the gates, she and her maid.
<br>11	And it came to pass, when she went down the hill, about break of day, that the watchmen of the Assyrians met her, and stopped her, say- ing: Whence comest thou or whither goest thou? 12 And she answered: I am a daughter of the Hebrews, and I  am fled  from them, because  I knew they would be made a prey to you, be- cause they despised you, and would not of their own accord yield themselves, that they might
<br>find mercy in your sight.
<br>13 For this reason I thought with myself, say- ing: I will go to the presence of the prince
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Holofernes, that I may tell him their secrets, and shew him by what way he may take them, with- out the loss of one man of his army.
<br>14	And when the men had heard her words, they beheld her face, and their eyes were amazed, for they wondered exceedingly at her beauty.
<br>15	And they said to her: Thou hast saved thy life by taking this resolution, to come down to our lord.
<br>16	And be assured of this, that when thou shalt stand before him, he will treat thee well, and thou wilt be most acceptable to his heart. And they brought her to the tent of Holofernes, telling him of her.
<br>17	And when she was come into his presence, forthwith Holofernes was caught by his eyes.
<br>18	And his officers said to him: Who can de- spise the people of the Hebrews, who have such beautiful women, that we should not think it worth our while for their sakes to fight against them?
<br>19	And Judith seeing Holofernes sitting under a canopy, which was woven of purple and gold, with emeralds and precious stones:
<br>20	After she had looked on his face, bowed down to him, prostrating herself to the ground. And the servants of Holofernes lifted her up, by the command of their master.
<br>
<br>Chapter 11
<br>Then Holofernes said to her: Be of good comfort, and fear not in thy heart: for I have never hurt a man that was willing to serve Nabuchodonosor the king.
<br>2	And if thy people had not despised me, I would never have lifted up my spear against them.
<br>3	But now tell me, for what cause hast thou
<br> 
<br>left them, and why it hath pleased thee to come to us?
<br>4	And Judith said to him: Receive the words of thy handmaid, for if thou wilt follow the words of thy handmaid, the Lord will do with thee a perfect thing.
<br>5	For as Nabuchodonosor the king of the earth liveth, and his power liveth which is in thee for chastising of all straying souls: not only men serve him through thee, but also the beasts of the field obey him.
<br>6	For the industry of thy mind is spoken of among all nations, and it is told through the whole world, that thou only art excellent, and mighty in all his kingdom, and thy discipline is cried up in all provinces.
<br>7	It is known also what Achior said, nor are we ignorant of what thou hast commanded to be done to him.
<br>8	For it is certain that our God is so offended with sins, that he hath sent word by his prophets to the people, that he will deliver them up for their sins.
<br>9	And because the children of Israel know they have offended their God, thy dread is upon them. 10 Moreover also a famine hath come upon them, and for drought of water they are already
<br>to be counted among the dead.
<br>11	And they have a design even to kill their cattle, and to drink the blood of them.
<br>12	And the consecrated things of the Lord their God which God forbade them to touch, in corn, wine, and oil, these have they purposed to make use of, and they design to consume the things which they ought not to touch with their hands: therefore because they do these things, it is certain they will be given up to destruction.
<br>13	And I thy handmaid knowing this, am fled from them, and the Lord hath sent me to tell thee these very things.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>14	For I thy handmaid worship God even now that I am with thee, and thy handmaid will go out, and I will pray to God,
<br>15	And he will tell me when he will repay them for their sins, and I will come and tell thee, so that I may bring thee through the midst of Jerusalem, and thou shalt have all the people of Israel, as sheep that have no shepherd, and there shall not so much as one dog bark against thee: 16 Because these things are told me by the
<br>providence of God.
<br>17	And because God is angry with them, I am sent to tell these very things to thee.
<br>18	And all these words pleased Holofernes, and his servants, and they admired her wisdom, and they said one to another:
<br>19	There is not such another woman upon earth in look, in beauty, and in sense of words.
<br>20	And Holofernes said to her: God hath done well who sent thee before the people, that thou mightest give them into our hands:
<br>21	And because thy promise is good, if thy God shall do this for me, he shall also be my God, and thou shalt be great in the house of Nabu- chodonosor, and thy name shall be renowned through all the earth.
<br>
<br>Chapter 12
<br>Then he ordered that she should go in where his treasures were laid up, and bade her tarry there, and he appointed what should be given her from his own table.
<br>2	And Judith answered him and said: Now I cannot eat of these things which thou comman- dest to be given me, lest sin come upon me: but I will eat of the things which I have brought.
<br>3	And Holofernes said to her: If these things which thou hast brought with thee fail thee,
<br> 
<br>what shall we do for thee?
<br>4	And Judith said: As thy soul liveth, my lord, thy handmaid shall not spend all these things till God do by my hand that which I have purposed. And his servants brought her into the tent which he had commanded.
<br>5	And when she was going in, she desired that she might have liberty to go out at night and before day to prayer, and to beseech the Lord.
<br>6	And he commanded his chamberlains, that she might go out and in, to adore her God as she pleased, for three days.
<br>7	And she went out in the nights into the val- ley of Bethulia, and washed herself in a fountain of water.
<br>8	And as she came up, she prayed to the Lord the God of Israel, that he would direct her way to the deliverance of his people.
<br>9	And going in, she remained pure in the tent, until she took her own meat in the evening.
<br>10	And it came to pass on the fourth day, that Holofernes made a supper for his servants, and said to Vagao his eunuch: Go, and persuade that Hebrew woman, to consent of her own accord to dwell with me.
<br>11	For it is looked upon as shameful among the Assyrians, if a woman mock a man, by doing so as to pass free from him.
<br>12	Then Vagao went in to Judith, and said: Let not my good maid be afraid to go in to my lord, that she may be honoured before his face, that she may eat with him and drink wine and be merry.
<br>13	And Judith answered him: Who am I, that I should gainsay my lord?
<br>14	All that shall be good and best before his eyes, I will do. And whatsoever shall please him, that shall be best to me all the days of my life.
<br>15	And she arose and dressed herself out with her garments, and going in she stood before his
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>face.
<br>16	And the heart of Holofernes was smitten, for he was burning with the desire of her.
<br>17	And Holofernes said to her: Drink now, and sit down and be merry; for thou hast found favour before me.
<br>18	And Judith said: I will drink my lord, be- cause my life is magnified this day above all my days.
<br>19	And she took and ate and drank before him what her maid had prepared for her.
<br>20	And Holofernes was made merry on her oc- casion, and drank exceeding much wine, so much as he had never drunk in his life.
<br>
<br>Chapter 13
<br>And when it was grown late, his servants made haste to their lodgings, and Vagao shut the chamber doors, and went his way.
<br>2	And they were all overcharged with wine.
<br>3	And Judith was alone in the chamber.
<br>4	But Holofernes lay on his bed, fast asleep, being exceedingly drunk.
<br>5	And Judith spoke to her maid to stand with- out before the chamber, and to watch:
<br>6	And Judith stood before the bed praying with tears, and the motion of her lips in silence, 7 Saying: Strengthen me, O Lord God of Is- rael, and in this hour look on the works of my hands, that as thou hast promised, thou mayst raise up Jerusalem thy city: and that I may bring to pass that which I have purposed, having a be-
<br>lief that it might be done by thee.
<br>8	And when she had said this, she went to the pillar that was at his bedâ€™s head, and loosed his sword that hung tied upon it.
<br>9	And when she had drawn it out, she took him by the hair of his head, and said: Strengthen
<br> 
<br>me, O Lord God, at this hour.
<br>10	And she struck twice upon his neck, and cut off his head, and took off his canopy from the pillars, and rolled away his headless body.
<br>11	And after a while she went out, and de- livered the head of Holofernes to her maid, and bade her put it into her wallet.
<br>12	And they two went out according to their custom, as it were to prayer, and they passed the camp, and having compassed the valley, they came to the gate of the city.
<br>13	And Judith from afar off cried to the watch- men upon the walls: Open the gates for God is with us, who hath shewn his power in Israel.
<br>14	And it came to pass, when the men had heard her voice, that they called the ancients of the city.
<br>15	And all ran to meet her from the least to the greatest: for they now had no hopes that she would come.
<br>16	And lighting up lights they all gathered round about her: and she went up to a higher place, and commanded silence to be made. And when all had held their peace,
<br>17	Judith said: Praise ye the Lord our God, who hath not forsaken them that hope in him.
<br>18	And by me his handmaid he hath fulfilled his mercy, which he promised to the house of Israel: and he hath killed the enemy of his people by my hand this night.
<br>19	Then she brought forth the head of Holofernes out of the wallet, and shewed it them, saying: Behold the head of Holofernes the gen- eral of the army of the Assyrians, and behold his canopy, wherein he lay in his drunkenness, where the Lord our God slew him by the hand of a woman.
<br>20	But as the same Lord liveth, his angel hath been my keeper both going hence, and abiding there, and returning from thence hither: and the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Lord hath not suffered me his handmaid to be defiled, but hath brought me back to you without pollution of sin, rejoicing for his victory, for my escape, and for your deliverance.
<br>21	Give all of you glory to him, because he is good, because his mercy endureth for ever.
<br>22	And they all adored the Lord, and said to her: The Lord hath blessed thee by his power, because by thee he hath brought our enemies to nought.
<br>23	And Ozias the prince of the people of Israel, said to her: Blessed art thou, O daughter, by the Lord the most high God, above all women upon the earth.
<br>24	Blessed be the Lord who made heaven and earth, who hath directed thee to the cutting off the head of the prince of our enemies.
<br>25	Because he hath so magnified thy name this day, that thy praise shall not depart out of the mouth of men who shall be mindful of the power of the Lord for ever, for that thou hast not spared thy life, by reason of the distress and tribulation of thy people, but hast prevented our ruin in the presence of our God.
<br>26	And all the people said: So be it, so be it. 27 And Achior being called for came, and Ju- dith said to him: The God of Israel, to whom thou gavest testimony, that he revengeth him- self of his enemies, he hath cut off the head of
<br>all the unbelievers this night by my hand.
<br>28	And that thou mayst find that it is so, behold the head of Holofernes, who in the con- tempt of his pride despised the God of Israel: and threatened them with death, saying: When the people of Israel shall be taken, I will com- mand thy sides to be pierced with a sword.
<br>29	Then Achior seeing the head of Holofernes, being seized with a great fear he fell on his face upon the earth, and his soul swooned away.
<br>30	But after he had recovered his spirits he fell
<br> 
<br>down at her feet, and reverenced her, and said:
<br>31	Blessed art thou by thy God in every taber- nacle of Jacob, for in every nation which shall hear thy name, the God of Israel shall be mag- nified on occasion of thee.
<br>
<br>Chapter 14
<br>And Judith said to all the people: Hear me, my brethren, hang ye up this head upon our walls.
<br>2	And as soon as the sun shall rise, let every man take his arms, and rush ye out, not as going down beneath, but as making an assault.
<br>3	Then the watchmen must needs run to awake their prince for the battle.
<br>4	And when the captains of them shall run to the tent of Holofernes, and shall find him without his head wallowing in his blood, fear shall fall upon them.
<br>5	And when you shall know that they are flee- ing, go after them securely, for the Lord will de- stroy them under your feet.
<br>6	Then Achior seeing the power that the God of Israel had wrought, leaving the religion of the Gentiles, he believed God, and circumcised the flesh of his foreskin, and was joined to the people of Israel, with all the succession of his kindred until this present day.
<br>7	And immediately at break of day, they hung up the head of Holofernes upon the walls, and every man took his arms, and they went out with a great noise and shouting.
<br>8	And the watchmen seeing this, ran to the tent of Holofernes.
<br>9	And they that were in the tent came, and made a noise, before the door of the chamber to awake him, endeavouring by art to break his rest, that Holofernes might awake, not by their calling him, but by their noise.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>10	For no man durst knock, or open and go into the chamber of the general of the Assyrians. 11 But when his captains and tribunes were come, and all the chiefs of the army of the king of the Assyrians, they said to the chamberlains: 12 Go in, and awake him, for the mice, coming out of their holes, have presumed to challenge us
<br>to fight.
<br>13	Then Vagao going into his chamber, stood before the curtain, and made a clapping with his hands: for he thought that he was sleeping with Judith.
<br>14	But when with hearkening, he perceived no motion of one lying, he came near to the cur- tain, and lifting it up, and seeing the body of Holofernes, lying upon the ground, without the head, weltering in his blood, he cried out with a loud voice, with weeping, and rent his garments. 15 And he went into the tent of Judith, and
<br>not finding her, he ran out to the people,
<br>16	And said: One Hebrew woman hath made confusion in the house of king Nabuchodonosor: for behold Holofernes lieth upon the ground, and his head is not upon him.
<br>17	Now when the chiefs of the army of the Assyrians had heard this, they all rent their gar- ments, and an intolerable fear and dread fell upon them, and their minds were troubled ex- ceedingly.
<br>18	And there was a very great cry in the midst of their camp.
<br>
<br>Chapter 15
<br>And when all the army heard that Holofernes was beheaded, courage and counsel fled from them, and being seized with trembling and fear they thought only to save themselves by flight.
<br>2 So that no one spoke to his neighbour, but
<br> 
<br>hanging down the head, leaving all things be- hind, they made haste to escape from the He- brews, who, as they heard, were coming armed upon them, and fled by the ways of the fields, and the paths of the hills.
<br>3	So the children of Israel seeing them fleeing, followed after them. And they went down sound- ing with trumpets and shouting after them.
<br>4	And because the Assyrians were not united together, they went without order in their flight; but the children of Israel pursuing in one body, defeated all that they could find.
<br>5	And Ozias sent messengers through all the cities and countries of Israel.
<br>6	And every country, and every city, sent their chosen young men armed after them, and they pursued them with the edge of the sword until they came to the extremities of their confines.
<br>7	And the rest that were in Bethulia went into the camp of the Assyrians, and took away the spoils which the Assyrians in their flight had left behind them, and they were laden exceedingly,
<br>8	But they that returned conquerors to Bethu- lia, brought with them all things that were theirs, so that there was no numbering of their cattle, and beasts, and all their moveables, inso- much that from the least to the greatest all were made rich by their spoils.
<br>9	And Joachim the high priest came from Jerusalem to Bethulia with all his ancients to see Judith.
<br>10	And when she was come out to him, they all blessed her with one voice, saying: Thou art the glory of Jerusalem, thou art the joy of Israel, thou art the honour of our people:
<br>11	For thou hast done manfully, and thy heart has been strengthened, because thou hast loved chastity, and after thy husband hast not known any other: therefore also the hand of the Lord hath strengthened thee, and therefore thou shalt
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>be blessed for ever.
<br>12	And all the people said: So be it, so be it. 13 And thirty days were scarce sufficient for the people of Israel to gather up the spoils of the
<br>Assyrians.
<br>14	But all those things that were proved to be the peculiar goods of Holofernes, they gave to Judith in gold, and silver, and garments and precious stones, and all household stuff, and they all were delivered to her by the people.
<br>15	And all the people rejoiced, with the women, and virgins, and young men, playing on instruments and harps.
<br>
<br>Chapter 16
<br>Then Judith sung this canticle to the Lord, say- ing:
<br>2	Begin ye to the Lord with timbrels, sing ye to the Lord with cymbals, tune unto him a new psalm, extol and call upon his name.
<br>3	The Lord putteth an end to wars, the Lord is his name.
<br>4	He hath set his camp in the midst of his people, to deliver us from the hand of all our enemies.
<br>5	The Assyrian came out of the mountains from the north in the multitude of his strength: his multitude stopped up the torrents, and their horses covered the valleys.
<br>6	He bragged that he would set my borders on fire, and kill my young men with the sword, to make my infants a prey, and my virgins captives. 7 But the almighty Lord hath struck him, and hath delivered him into the hands of a woman,
<br>and hath slain him.
<br>8	For their mighty one did not fall by young men, neither did the sons of Titan strike him, nor tall giants oppose themselves to him, but Judith
<br> 
<br>the daughter of Merari weakened him with the beauty of her face.
<br>9	For she put off her the garments of widow- hood, and put on her the garments of joy, to give joy to the children of Israel.
<br>10	She anointed her face with ointment, and bound up her locks with a crown, she took a new robe to deceive him.
<br>11	Her sandals ravished his eyes, her beauty made his soul her captive, with a sword she cut off his head.
<br>12	The Persians quaked at her constancy, and the Medes at her boldness.
<br>13	Then the camp of the Assyrians howled, when my lowly ones appeared, parched with thirst.
<br>14	The sons of the damsels have pierced them through, and they have killed them like children fleeing away: they perished in battle before the face of the Lord my God.
<br>15	Let us sing a hymn to the Lord, let us sing a new hymn to our God.
<br>16	O Adonai, Lord, great art thou, and glori- ous in thy power, and no one can overcome thee. 17 Let all thy creatures serve thee: because thou hast spoken, and they were made: thou didst send forth thy spirit, and they were cre- ated, and there is no one that can resist thy
<br>voice.
<br>18	The mountains shall be moved from the foundations with the waters: the rocks shall melt as wax before thy face.
<br>19	But they that fear thee, shall be great with thee in all things.
<br>20	Woe be to the nation that riseth up against my people: for the Lord almighty will take re- venge on them, in the day of judgment he will visit them.
<br>21	For he will give fire, and worms into their flesh, that they may burn, and may feel for ever.
<br> 
<br>
<br>22	And it came to pass after these things, that all the people, after the victory, came to Jerusalem to adore the Lord: and as soon as they were purified, they all offered holocausts, and vows, and their promises.
<br>23	And Judith offered for an anathema of oblivion all the arms of Holofernes, which the people gave her, and the canopy that she had taken away out of his chamber.
<br>24	And the people were joyful in the sight of the sanctuary, and for three months the joy of this victory was celebrated with Judith.
<br>25	And after those days every man returned to his house, and Judith was made great in Bethu- lia, and she was most renowned in all the land of Israel.
<br>26	And chastity was joined to her virtue, so that she knew no man all the days of her life, after the death of Manasses her husband.
<br>27	And on festival days she came forth with great glory.
<br>28	And she abode in her husbandâ€™s house a hundred and five years, and made her handmaid free, and she died, and was buried with her hus- band in Bethulia.
<br>29	And all the people mourned for seven days. 30 And all the time of her life there was none that troubled Israel, nor many years after her
<br>death.
<br>31 But the day of the festivity of this vic- tory is received by the Hebrews in the number of holy days, and is religiously observed by the Jews from that time until this day.

<br>Book of Esther
<br>
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>In the days of Assuerus, who reigned from In- dia to Ethiopia over a hundred and twenty seven provinces:
<br>2	When he sat on the throne of his kingdom, the city Susan was the capital of his kingdom.
<br>3	Now in the third year of his reign he made a great feast for all the princes, and for his ser- vants, for the most mighty of the Persians, and the nobles of the Medes, and the governors of the provinces in his sight,
<br>4	That he might shew the riches of the glory of his kingdom, and the greatness, and boasting of his power, for a long time, to wit, for a hundred and fourscore days.
<br>5	And when the days of the feast were expired, he invited all the people that were found in Su- san, from the greatest to the least: and com- manded a feast to be made seven days in the court of the garden, and of the wood, which was planted by the care and the hand of the king.
<br>6	And there were hung up on every side sky coloured, and green, and violet hangings, fas- tened with cords of silk, and of purple, which were put into rings of ivory, and were held up with marble pillars. The beds also were of gold and silver, placed in order upon a floor paved with porphyry and white marble: which was em- bellished with painting of wonderful variety.
<br>7	And they that were invited, drank in golden cups, and the meats were brought in divers ves-
<br> 
<br>
<br>sels one after another. Wine also in abundance and of the best was presented, as was worthy of a kingâ€™s magnificence.
<br>8	Neither was there any one to compel them to drink that were not willing, but as the king had appointed, who set over every table one of his nobles, that every man might take what he would.
<br>9	Also Vasthi the queen made a feast for the women in the palace, where king Assuerus was used to dwell.
<br>10	Now on the seventh day, when the king was merry, and after very much drinking was well warmed with wine, he commanded Mauman, and Bazatha, and Harbona, and Bagatha, and Abgatha, and Zethar, and Charcas, the seven eunuchs that served in his presence,
<br>11	To bring in queen Vasthi before the king, with the crown set upon her head, to shew her beauty to all the people and the princes: for she was exceeding beautiful.
<br>12	But she refused, and would not come at the kingâ€™s commandment, which he had signified to her by the eunuchs. Whereupon the king, being angry, and inflamed with a very great fury,
<br>13	Asked the wise men, who according to the custom of the kings, were always near his person, and all he did was by their counsel, who knew the laws, and judgments of their forefathers:
<br>14	(Now the chief and nearest him were, Charsena, and Sethar, and Admatha, and Thar- sis, and Mares, and Marsana, and Mamuchan,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>seven princes of the Persians and of the Medes, who saw the face of the king, and were used to sit first after him:)
<br>15	What sentence ought to pass upon Vasthi the queen, who had refused to obey the com- mandment of king Assuerus, which he had sent to her by the eunuchs?
<br>16	And Mamuchan answered, in the hearing of the king and the princes: Queen Vasthi hath not only injured the king, but also all the people and princes that are in all the provinces of king Assuerus.
<br>17	For this deed of the queen will go abroad to all women, so that they will despise their hus- bands, and will say: King Assuerus commanded that queen Vasthi should come in to him, and she would not.
<br>18	And by this example all the wives of the princes of the Persians and the Medes will slight the commandments of their husbands: wherefore the kingâ€™s indignation is just.
<br>19	If it please thee, let an edict go out from thy presence, and let it be written according to the law of the Persians and of the Medes, which must not be altered, that Vasthi come in no more to the king, but another, that is better than her, be made queen in her place.
<br>20	And let this be published through all the provinces of thy empire, (which is very wide,) and let all wives, as well of the greater as of the lesser, give honour to their husbands.
<br>21	His counsel pleased the king, and the princes: and the king did according to the coun- sel of Mamuchan.
<br>22	And he sent letters to all the provinces of his kingdom, as every nation could hear and read, in divers languages and characters, that the husbands should be rulers and masters in their houses: and that this should be published to every people.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 2
<br>After this, when the wrath of king Assuerus was appeased, he remembered Vasthi, and what she had done and what she had suffered:
<br>2	And the kingâ€™s servants and his officers said: Let young women be sought for the king, virgins and beautiful,
<br>3	And let some persons be sent through all the provinces to look for beautiful maidens and virgins: and let them bring them to the city of Susan, and put them into the house of the women under the hand of Egeus the eunuch, who is the overseer and keeper of the kingâ€™s women: and let them receive womenâ€™s ornaments, and other things necessary for their use.
<br>4	And whosoever among them all shall please the kingâ€™s eyes, let her be queen instead of Vasthi. The word pleased the king: and he com- manded it should be done as they had suggested. 5 There was a man in the city of Susan, a Jew, named Mardochai, the son of Jair, the son
<br>of Semei, the son of Cis, of the race of Jemini,
<br>6	Who had been carried away from Jerusalem at the time that Nabuchodonosor king of Baby- lon carried away Jechonias king of Juda,
<br>7	And he had brought up his brotherâ€™s daugh- ter Edissa, who by another name was called Es- ther: now she had lost both her parents: and was exceeding fair and beautiful. And her father and mother being dead, Mardochai adopted her for his daughter.
<br>8	And when the kingâ€™s ordinance was noised abroad, and according to his commandment many beautiful virgins were brought to Susan, and were delivered to Egeus the eunuch: Esther also among the rest of the maidens was delivered to him to be kept in the number of the women. 9 And she pleased him, and found favour in his sight. And he commanded the eunuch to hasten
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>the womenâ€™s ornaments, and to deliver to her her part, and seven of the most beautiful maidens of the kingâ€™s house, and to adorn and deck out both her and her waiting maids.
<br>10	And she would not tell him her people nor her country. For Mardochai had charged her to say nothing at all of that:
<br>11	And he walked every day before the court of the house, in which the chosen virgins were kept, having a care for Estherâ€™s welfare, and de- siring to know what would befall her.
<br>12	Now when every virginâ€™s turn came to go in to the king, after all had been done for setting them off to advantage, it was the twelfth month: so that for six months they were anointed with oil of myrrh, and for other six months they used certain perfumes and sweet spices.
<br>13	And when they were going in to the king, whatsoever they asked to adorn themselves they received: and being decked out, as it pleased them, they passed from the chamber of the women to the kingâ€™s chamber.
<br>14	And she that went in at evening, came out in the morning, and from thence she was con- ducted to the second house, that was under the hand of Susagaz the eunuch, who had the charge over the kingâ€™s concubines: neither could she re- turn any more to the king, unless the king de- sired it, and had ordered her by name to come. 15 And as the time came orderly about, the day was at hand, when Esther, the daughter of Abihail the brother of Mardochai, whom he had adopted for his daughter, was to go in to the king. But she sought not womenâ€™s ornaments, but whatsoever Egeus the eunuch the keeper of the virgins had a mind, he gave her to adorn her. For she was exceeding fair, and her incredible beauty made her appear agreeable and amiable
<br>in the eyes of all.
<br>16	So she was brought to the chamber of
<br> 
<br>king Assuerus the tenth month, which is called Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.
<br>17	And the king loved her more than all the women, and she had favour and kindness before him above all the women, and he set the royal crown on her head, and made her queen instead of Vasthi.
<br>18	And he commanded a magnificent feast to be prepared for all the princes, and for his ser- vants, for the marriage and wedding of Esther, And he gave rest to all the provinces, and be- stowed gifts according to princely magnificence.
<br>19	And when the virgins were sought the second time, and gathered together, Mardochai stayed at the kingâ€™s gate,
<br>20	Neither had Esther as yet declared her country and people, according to his command- ment. For whatsoever he commanded, Esther observed: and she did all things in the same manner as she was wont at that time when he brought her up a little one.
<br>21	At that time, therefore, when Mardochai abode at the kingâ€™s gate, Bagathan and Thares, two of the kingâ€™s eunuchs, who were porters, and presided in the first entry of the palace, were angry: and they designed to rise up against the king, and to kill him.
<br>22	And Mardochai had notice of it, and im- mediately he told it to queen Esther: and she to the king in Mardochaiâ€™s name, who had reported the thing unto her.
<br>23	It was inquired into, and found out: and they were both hanged on a gibbet. And it was put in the histories, and recorded in the chroni- cles before the king.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 3
<br>After these things, king Assuerus advanced Aman, the son of Amadathi, who was of the race of Agag: and he set his throne above all the princes that were with him.
<br>2	And all the kingâ€™s servants, that were at the doors of the palace, bent their knees, and worshipped Aman: for so the emperor had com- manded them, only Mardochai did not bend his knee, nor worship him.
<br>3	And the kingâ€™s servants that were chief at the doors of the palace, said to him: Why dost thou alone not observe the kingâ€™s commandment?
<br>4	And when they were saying this often, and he would not hearken to them, they told Aman, desirous to know whether he would continue in his resolution: for he had told them that he was a Jew.
<br>5	Now when Aman had heard this, and had proved by experience that Mardochai did not bend his knee to him, nor worship him, he was exceeding angry.
<br>6	And he counted it nothing to lay his hands upon Mardochai alone: for he had heard that he was of the nation of the Jews, and he chose rather to destroy all the nation of the Jews that were in the kingdom of Assuerus.
<br>7	In the first month (which is called Nisan) in the twelfth year of the reign of Assuerus, the lot was cast into an urn, which in Hebrew is called Phur, before Aman, on what day and what month the nation of the Jews should be de- stroyed: and there came out the twelfth month, which is called Adar.
<br>8	And Aman said to king Assuerus: There is a people scattered through all the provinces of thy kingdom, and separated one from another, that use new laws and ceremonies, and moreover despise the kingâ€™s ordinances: and thou knowest
<br> 
<br>very well that it is not expedient for thy kingdom that they should grow insolent by impunity.
<br>9	If it please thee, decree that they may be destroyed, and I will pay ten thousand talents to thy treasurers.
<br>10	And the king took the ring that he used, from his own hand, and gave it to Aman, the son of Amadathi of the race of Agag, the enemy of the Jews,
<br>11	And he said to him: As to the money which thou promisest, keep it for thyself: and as to the people, do with them as seemeth good to thee.
<br>12	And the kingâ€™s scribes were called in the first month Nisan, on the thirteenth day of the same mouth: and they wrote, as Aman had com- manded, to all the kingâ€™s lieutenants, and to the judges of the provinces, and of divers nations, as every nation could read, and hear according to their different languages, in the name of king Assuerus: and the letters, sealed with his ring,
<br>13	Were sent by the kingâ€™s messengers to all provinces, to kill and destroy all the Jews, both young and old, little children, and women, in one day, that is, on the thirteenth of the twelfth month, which is called Adar, and to make a spoil of their goods.
<br>14	And the contents of the letters were to this effect, that all provinces might know and be ready against that day.
<br>15	The couriers that were sent made haste to fulfil the kingâ€™s commandment. And imme- diately the edict was hung up in Susan, the king and Aman feasting together, and all the Jews that were in the city weeping.
<br>
<br>Chapter 4
<br>Now when Mardochai had heard these things, he rent his garments, and put on sackcloth, strewing
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>ashes on his head and he cried with a loud voice in the street in the midst of the city, shewing the anguish of his mind.
<br>2	And he came lamenting in this manner even to the gate of the palace: for no one clothed with sackcloth might enter the kingâ€™s court.
<br>3	And in all provinces, towns, and places, to which the kingâ€™s cruel edict was come, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting, wailing, and weeping, many using sackcloth and ashes for their bed.
<br>4	Then Estherâ€™s maids and her eunuchs went in, and told her. And when she heard it she was in a consternation and she sent a garment, to clothe him, and to take away the sackcloth: but he would not receive it.
<br>5	And she called for Athach the eunuch, whom the king had appointed to attend upon her, and she commanded him to go to Mardochai, and learn of him why he did this.
<br>6	And Athach going out went to Mardochai, who was standing in the street of the city, before the palace gate:
<br>7	And Mardochai told him all that had hap- pened, how Aman had promised to pay money into the kingâ€™s treasures, to have the Jews de- stroyed.
<br>8	He gave him also a copy of the edict which was hanging up in Susan, that he should shew it to the queen, and admonish her to go in to the king, and to entreat him for her people.
<br>9	And Athach went back and told Esther all that Mardochai had said.
<br>10	She answered him, and bade him say to Mardochai:
<br>11	All the kingâ€™s servants, and all the provinces that are under his dominion, know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, cometh into the kingâ€™s inner court, who is not called for, is immediately to be put to death without any
<br> 
<br>delay: except the king shall hold out the golden sceptre to him, in token of clemency, that so he may live. How then can I go in to the king, who for these thirty days now have not been called unto him?
<br>12	And when Mardochai had heard this,
<br>13	He sent word to Esther again, saying: Think not that thou mayst save thy life only, because thou art in the kingâ€™s house, more than all the Jews:
<br>14	For if thou wilt now hold thy peace, the Jews shall be delivered by some other occasion: and thou, and thy fatherâ€™s house shall perish. And who knoweth whether thou art not there- fore come to the kingdom, that thou mightest be ready in such a time as this?
<br>15	And again Esther sent to Mardochai in these words:
<br>16	Go, and gather together all the Jews whom thou shalt find in Susan, and pray ye for me. Neither eat nor drink for three days and three nights: and I with my handmaids will fast in like manner, and then I will go in to the king, against the law, not being called, and expose myself to death and to danger.
<br>17	So Mardochai went, and did all that Esther had commanded him.
<br>
<br>Chapter 5
<br>And on the third day Esther put on her royal ap- parel, and stood in the inner court of the kingâ€™s house, over against the kingâ€™s hall: now he sat upon his throne in the hall of the palace, over against the door of the house.
<br>2 And when he saw Esther the queen standing, she pleased his eyes, and he held out toward her the golden sceptre, which he held in his hand and she drew near, and kissed the top of his sceptre.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>3	And the king said to her: What wilt thou, queen Esther? what is thy request? if thou shouldst even ask one half of the kingdom, it shall be given to thee.
<br>4	But she answered: If it please the king, I beseech thee to come to me this day, and Aman with thee to the banquet which I have prepared. 5 And the king said forthwith: Call ye Aman quickly, that he may obey Estherâ€™s will. So the king and Aman came to the banquet which the
<br>queen had prepared for them.
<br>6	And the king said to her, after he had drunk wine plentifully: What dost thou desire should be given thee? and for what thing askest thou? although thou shouldst ask the half of my king- dom, thou shalt have it.
<br>7	And Esther answered: My petition and re- quest is this:
<br>8	If I have found favour in the kingâ€™s sight, and if it please the king to give me what I ask, and to fulfil my petition: let the king and Aman come to the banquet which I have prepared them, and to morrow I will open my mind to the king.
<br>9	So Aman went out that day joyful and merry. And when he saw Mardochai sitting be- fore the gate of the palace, and that he not only did not rise up to honour him, but did not so much as move from the place where he sat, he was exceedingly angry:
<br>10	But dissembling his anger, and returning into his house, he called together to him his friends, and Zares his wife:
<br>11	And he declared to them the greatness of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and with how great glory the king had advanced him above all his princes and servants.
<br>12	And after this he said: Queen Esther also hath invited no other to the banquet with the king, but me: and with her I am also to dine to morrow with the king:
<br> 
<br>13	And whereas I have all these things, I think I have nothing, so long as I see Mardochai the Jew sitting before the kingâ€™s gate.
<br>14	Then Zares his wife, and the rest of his friends answered him: Order a great beam to be prepared, fifty cubits high, and in the morn- ing speak to the king, that Mardochai may be hanged upon it, and so thou shalt go full of joy with the king to the banquet. The counsel pleased him, and he commanded a high gibbet to be prepared.
<br>
<br>Chapter 6
<br>That night the king passed without sleep, and he commanded the histories and chronicles of for- mer times to be brought him. And when they were reading them before him,
<br>2	They came to that place where it was writ- ten, how Mardochai had discovered the trea- son of Bagathan and Thares the eunuchs, who sought to kill king Assuerus.
<br>3	And when the king heard this, he said: What honour and reward hath Mardochai re- ceived for this fidelity? His servants and min- isters said to him: He hath received no reward at all.
<br>4	And the king said immediately: Who is in the court? for Aman was coming in to the inner court of the kingâ€™s house, to speak to the king, that he might order Mardochai to be hanged upon the gibbet, which was prepared for him.
<br>5	The servants answered: Aman standeth in the court, and the king said: Let him come in.
<br>6	And when he was come in, he said to him: What ought to be done to the man whom the king is desirous to honour? But Aman thinking in his heart, and supposing that the king would honour no other but himself,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>7	Answered: The man whom the king desireth to honour,
<br>8	Ought to be clothed with the kingâ€™s apparel, and to be set upon the horse that the king rideth upon, and to have the royal crown upon his head, 9 And let the first of the kingâ€™s princes and nobles hold his horse, and going through the street of the city, proclaim before him and say:
<br>Thus shall he be honoured, whom the king hath a mind to honour.
<br>10	And the king said to him: Make haste and take the robe and the horse, and do as thou hast spoken to Mardochai the Jew, who sitteth before the gates of the palace. Beware thou pass over any of those things which thou hast spoken.
<br>11	So Aman took the robe and the horse, and arraying Mardochai in the street of the city, and setting him on the horse, went before him, and proclaimed: This honour is he worthy of, whom the king hath a mind to honour.
<br>12	But Mardochai returned to the palace gate: and Aman made haste to go to his house, mourn- ing and having his head covered:
<br>13	And he told Zares his wife, and his friends, all that had befallen him. And the wise men whom he had in counsel, and his wife answered him: If Mardochai be of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou canst not resist him, but thou shalt fall in his sight.
<br>14	As they were yet speaking, the kingâ€™s eu- nuchs came, and compelled him to go quickly to the banquet which the queen had prepared.
<br>
<br>Chapter 7
<br>So the king and Aman went in, to drink with the queen.
<br>2	And the king said to her again the second day, after he was warm with wine:  What is thy
<br> 
<br>petition, Esther, that it may be granted thee? and what wilt thou have done: although thou ask the half of my kingdom, thou shalt have it.
<br>3	Then she answered: If I have found favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please thee, give me my life for which I ask, and my people for which I request.
<br>4	For we are given up, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. And would God we were sold for bondmen and bondwomen: the evil might be borne with, and I would have mourned in silence: but now we have an enemy, whose cruelty redoundeth upon the king.
<br>5	And king Assuerus answered and said: Who is this, and of what power, that he should do these things?
<br>6	And Esther said: It is this Aman that is our adversary and most wicked enemy. Aman hearing this was forthwith astonished, not being able to bear the countenance of the king and of the queen.
<br>7	But the king being angry rose up, and went from the place of the banquet into the garden set with trees. Aman also rose up to entreat Esther the queen for his life, for he understood that evil was prepared for him by the king.
<br>8	And when the king came back out of the garden set with trees, and entered into the place of the banquet, he found Aman was fallen upon the bed on which Esther lay, and he said: He will force the queen also in my presence, in my own house. The word was not yet gone out of the kingâ€™s mouth, and immediately they covered his face.
<br>9	And Harbona, one of the eunuchs that stood waiting on the king, said: Behold the gibbet which he hath prepared for Mardochai, who spoke for the king, standeth in Amanâ€™s house, being fifty cubits high. And the king said to him: Hang him upon it.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>10	So Aman was hanged on the gibbet, which he had prepared for Mardochai: and the kingâ€™s wrath ceased.
<br>
<br>Chapter 8
<br>On that day king Assuerus gave the house of Aman, the Jewsâ€™ enemy, to queen Esther, and Mardochai came in before the king. For Esther had confessed to him that he was her uncle.
<br>2	And the king took the ring which he had commanded to be taken again from Aman, and gave it to Mardochai. And Esther set Mardochai over her house.
<br>3	And not content with these things, she fell down at the kingâ€™s feet and wept, and speak- ing to him besought him, that he would give or- ders that the malice of Aman the Agagite, and his most wicked devices which he had invented against the Jews, should be of no effect.
<br>4	But he, as the manner was, held out the golden sceptre with his hand, which was the sign of clemency: and she arose up and stood before him,
<br>5	And said: If it please the king, and if I have found favour in his sight, and my request be not disagreeable to him, I beseech thee, that the for- mer letters of Aman the traitor and enemy of the Jews, by which he commanded that they should be destroyed in all the kingâ€™s provinces, may be reversed by new letters.
<br>6	For how can I endure the murdering and slaughter of my people?
<br>7	And king Assuerus answered Esther the queen, and Mardochai the Jew: I have given Amanâ€™s house to Esther, and I have commanded him to be hanged on a gibbet, because he durst lay hands on the Jews.
<br>8	Write ye therefore to the Jews, as it pleaseth
<br> 
<br>you in the kingâ€™s name, and seal the letters with my ring. For this was the custom, that no man durst gainsay the letters which were sent in the kingâ€™s name, and were sealed with his ring.
<br>9	Then the kingâ€™s scribes and secretaries were called for (now it was the time of the third month which is called Siban) the three and twentieth day of the month, and letters were written, as Mardochai had a mind, to the Jews, and to the governors, and to the deputies, and to the judges, who were rulers over the hundred and twenty- seven provinces, from India even to Ethiopia: to province and province, to people and people, ac- cording to their languages and characters, and to the Jews, according as they could read and hear.
<br>10	And these letters which were sent in the kingâ€™s name, were sealed with his ring, and sent by posts: who were to run through all the provinces, to prevent the former letters with new messages.
<br>11	And the king gave orders to them, to speak to the Jews in every city, and to command them to gather themselves together, and to stand for their lives, and to kill and destroy all their ene- mies with their wives and children and all their houses, and to take their spoil.
<br>12	And one day of revenge was appointed through all the provinces, to wit, the thirteenth of the twelfth month Adar.
<br>13	And this was the content of the letter, that it should be notified in all lands and peoples that were subject to the empire of king Assuerus, that the Jews were ready to be revenged of their en- emies.
<br>14	So the swift posts went out carrying the messages, and the kingâ€™s edict was hung up in Susan.
<br>15	And Mardochai going forth out of the palace, and from the kingâ€™s presence, shone in
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>royal apparel, to wit, of violet and sky colour, wearing a golden crown on his head, and clothed with a cloak of silk and purple. And all the city rejoiced, and was glad.
<br>16	But to the Jews, a new light seemed to rise, joy, honour, and dancing.
<br>17	And in all peoples, cities, and provinces, whithersoever the kingâ€™s commandments came, there was wonderful rejoicing, feasts and ban- quets, and keeping holy day: Insomuch that many of other nations and religion, joined them- selves to their worship and ceremonies. For a great dread of the name of the Jews had fallen upon all.
<br>
<br>Chapter 9
<br>So on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which as we have said above is called Adar, when all the Jews were designed to be massacred, and their enemies were greedy after their blood, the case being altered, the Jews began to have the upper hand, and to revenge themselves of their adversaries.
<br>2	And they gathered themselves together in every city, and town, and place, to lay their hands on their enemies, and their persecutors. And no one durst withstand them, for the fear of their power had gone through every people.
<br>3	And the judges of the provinces, and the governors, and lieutenants, and every one in dig- nity, that presided over every place and work, extolled the Jews for fear of Mardochai:
<br>4	For they knew him to be prince of the palace, and to have great power: and the fame of his name increased daily, and was spread abroad through all menâ€™s mouths.
<br>5	So the Jews made a great slaughter of their enemies, and killed them, repaying according to
<br> 
<br>what they had prepared to do to them:
<br>6	Insomuch that even in Susan they killed five hundred men, besides the ten sons of Aman the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews: whose names are these:
<br>7	Pharsandatha, and Delphon, and Esphatha 8 And Phoratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha, 9 And Phermesta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and
<br>Jezatha.
<br>10	And when they had slain them, they would not touch the spoils of their goods.
<br>11	And presently the number of them that were killed in Susan was brought to the king.
<br>12	And he said to the queen: The Jews have killed five hundred men in the city of Susan, be- sides the ten sons of Aman: how many dost thou think they have slain in all the provinces? What askest thou more, and what wilt thou have me to command to be done?
<br>13	And she answered: If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews, to do to morrow in Susan as they have done to day, and that the ten sons of Aman may be hanged upon gibbets. 14 And the king commanded that it should be so done. And forthwith the edict was hung up in
<br>Susan, and the ten sons of Aman were hanged.
<br>15	And on the fourteenth day of the month Adar the Jews gathered themselves together, and they killed in Susan three hundred men: but they took not their substance.
<br>16	Moreover through all the provinces which were subject to the kingâ€™s dominion the Jews stood for their lives, and slew their enemies and persecutors: insomuch that the number of them that were killed amounted to seventy-five thou- sand, and no man took any of their goods.
<br>17	Now the thirteenth day of the month Adar was the first day with them all of the slaugh- ter, and on the fourteenth day they left off. Which they ordained to be kept holy day, so that
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>all times hereafter they should celebrate it with feasting, joy, and banquets.
<br>18	But they that were killing in the city of Su- san, were employed in the slaughter on the thir- teenth and fourteenth day of the same month: and on the fifteenth day they rested. And there- fore they appointed that day to be a holy day of feasting and gladness.
<br>19	But those Jews that dwelt in towns not walled and in villages, appointed the fourteenth day of the month Adar for banquets and glad- ness, so as to rejoice on that day, and send one another portions of their banquets and meats.
<br>20	And Mardochai wrote all these things, and sent them comprised in letters to the Jews that abode in all the kingâ€™s provinces, both those that lay near and those afar off,
<br>21	That they should receive the fourteenth and fifteenth day of the month Adar for holy days, and always at the return of the year should celebrate them with solemn honour:
<br>22	Because on those days the Jews revenged themselves of their enemies, and their mourning and sorrow were turned into mirth and joy, and that these should be days of feasting and glad- ness, in which they should send one to another portions of meats, and should give gifts to the poor.
<br>23	And the Jews undertook to observe with solemnity all they had begun to do at that time, which Mardochai by letters had commanded to be done.
<br>24	For Aman, the son of Amadathi of the race of Agag, the enemy and adversary of the Jews, had devised evil against them, to kill them and destroy them; and had cast Phur, that is, the lot.
<br>25	And afterwards Esther went in to the king, beseeching him that his endeavours might be made void by the kingâ€™s letters: and the evil that
<br> 
<br>he had intended against the Jews, might return upon his own head. And so both he and his sons were hanged upon gibbets.
<br>26	And since that time these days are called Phurim, that is, of lots: because Phur, that is, the lot, was cast into the urn. And all things that were done, are contained in the volume of this epistle, that is, of this book:
<br>27	And the things that they suffered, and that were afterwards changed, the Jews took upon themselves and their seed, and upon all that had a mind to be joined to their religion, so that it should be lawful for none to pass these days with- out solemnity: which the writing testifieth, and certain times require, as the years continually succeed one another.
<br>28	These are the days which shall never be for- got: and which all provinces in the whole world shall celebrate throughout all generations: nei- ther is there any city wherein the days of Phurim, that is, of lots, must not be observed by the Jews, and by their posterity, which is bound to these ceremonies.
<br>29	And Esther the queen, the daughter of Abi- hail, and Mardochai the Jew, wrote also a second epistle, that with all diligence this day should be established a festival for the time to come.
<br>30	And they sent to all the Jews that were in the hundred and twenty-seven provinces of king Assuerus, that they should have peace, and re- ceive truth,
<br>31	And observe the days of lots, and celebrate them with joy in their proper time: as Mardochai and Esther had appointed, and they undertook them to be observed by themselves and by their seed, fasts, and cries, and the days of lots,
<br>32	And all things which are contained in the history of this book, which is called Esther.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 10
<br>And king Assuerus made all the land, and all the islands of the sea tributary.
<br>2	And his strength and his empire, and the dignity and greatness wherewith he exalted Mar- dochai, are written in the books of the Medes, and of the Persians:
<br>3	And how Mardochai of the race of the Jews, was next after king Assuerus: and great among the Jews, and acceptable to the people of his brethren, seeking the good of his people, and speaking those things which were for the welfare of his seed.
<br>4	Then Mardochai said: God hath done these things.
<br>5	I remember a dream that I saw, which signi- fied these same things: and nothing thereof hath failed.
<br>6	The little fountain which grew into a river, and was turned into a light, and into the sun, and abounded into many waters, is Esther, whom the king married, and made queen.
<br>7	But the two dragons are I and Aman.
<br>8	The nations that were assembled are they that endeavoured to destroy the name of the Jews.
<br>9	And my nation is Israel, who cried to the Lord, and the Lord saved his people: and he de- livered us from all evils, and hath wrought great signs and wonders among the nations:
<br>10	And he commanded that there should be two lots, one of the people of God, and the other of all the nations.
<br>11	And both lots came to the day appointed already from that time before God to all nations: 12 And the Lord remembered his people, and
<br>had mercy on his inheritance.
<br>13 And these days shall be observed in the month of Adar on the fourteenth, and fifteenth
<br> 
<br>day of the same month, with all diligence, and joy of the people gathered into one assembly, throughout all the generations hereafter of the people of Israel.
<br>
<br>Chapter 11
<br>In the fourth year of the reign of Ptolemy and Cleopatra, Dositheus, who said he was a priest, and of the Levitical race, and Ptolemy his son brought this epistle of Phurim, which they said Lysimachus the son of Ptolemy had interpreted in Jerusalem.
<br>2	In the second year of the reign of Artaxerxes the great, in the first day of the month Nisan, Mardochai the son of Jair, the son of Semei, the son of Cis, of the tribe of Benjamin:
<br>3	A Jew who dwelt in the city of Susan, a great man and among the first of the kingâ€™s court, had a dream.
<br>4	Now he was of the number of the captives, whom Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon had car- ried away from Jerusalem with Jechonias king of Juda:
<br>5	And this was his dream: Behold there were voices, and tumults, and thunders, and earth- quakes, and a disturbance upon the earth.
<br>6	And behold two great dragons came forth ready to fight one against another.
<br>7	And at their cry all nations were stirred up to fight against the nation of the just.
<br>8	And that was a day of darkness and danger, of tribulation and distress, and great fear upon the earth.
<br>9	And the nation of the just was troubled fear- ing their own evils, and was prepared for death. 10 And they cried to God: and as they were crying, a little fountain grew into a very great
<br>river, and abounded into many waters.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>11	The light and the sun rose up, and the humble were exalted, and they devoured the glo- rious.
<br>12	And when Mardochai had seen this, and arose out of his bed, he was thinking what God would do: and he kept it fixed in his mind, de- sirous to know what the dream should signify.
<br>
<br>Chapter 12
<br>And he abode at that time in the kingâ€™s court with Bagatha and Thara the kingâ€™s eunuchs, who were porters of the palace.
<br>2 And when he understood their designs, and had diligently searched into their projects, he learned that they went about to lay violent hands on king Artaxerxes, and he told the king thereof. 3 Then the king had them both examined, and after they had confessed, commanded them to be
<br>put to death.
<br>4	But the king made a record of what was done: and Mardochai also committed the mem- ory of the thing to writing.
<br>5	And the king commanded him, to abide in the court of the palace, and gave him presents for the information.
<br>6	But Aman the son of Amadathi the Bugite was in great honour with the king, and sought to hurt Mardochai and his people, because of the two eunuchs of the king who were put to death.
<br>
<br>Chapter 13
<br>And this was the copy of the letter: Artax- erxes the great king who reigneth from India to Ethiopia, to the princes and governors of the hundred and twenty-seven provinces, that are subject to his empire, greeting.
<br> 
<br>2	Whereas I reigned over many nations, and had brought all the world under my dominion, I was not willing to abuse the greatness of my power, but to govern my subjects with clemency and that they might live quietly without any ter- ror, and might enjoy peace, which is desired by all men,
<br>3	But when I asked my counsellors how this might be accomplished, one that excelled the rest in wisdom and fidelity, and was second after the king, Aman by name,
<br>4	Told me that there was a people scattered through the whole world, which used new laws, and acted against the customs of all nations, de- spised the commandments of kings, and violated by their opposition the concord of all nations.
<br>5	Wherefore having learned this, and seeing one nation in opposition to all mankind using perverse laws, and going against our command- ments, and disturbing the peace and concord of the provinces subject to us,
<br>6	We have commanded that all whom Aman shall mark out, who is chief over all the provinces, and second after the king, and whom we honour as a father, shall be utterly destroyed by their enemies, with their wives and children, and that none shall have pity on them, on the fourteenth day of the twelfth month Adar of this present year:
<br>7	That these wicked men going down to hell in one day, may restore to our empire the peace which they had disturbed.
<br>8	But Mardochai besought the Lord, remem- bering all his works,
<br>9	And said: O Lord, Lord, almighty king, for all things are in thy power, and there is none that can resist thy will, if thou determine to save Israel.
<br>10	Thou hast made heaven and earth and all things that are under the cope of heaven.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>11	Thou art Lord of all, and there is none that can resist thy majesty.
<br>12	Thou knowest all things, and thou knowest that it was not out of pride and or any desire of glory, that I refused to worship the proud Aman, 13 (For I would willingly and readily for the salvation of Israel have kissed even the steps of
<br>his feet,)
<br>14	But I feared lest I should transfer the hon- our of my God to a man, and lest I should adore any one except my God.
<br>15	And now, O Lord, O king, O God of Abra- ham, have mercy on thy people, because our en- emies resolve to destroy us, and extinguish thy inheritance.
<br>16	Despise not thy portion, which thou hast redeemed for thyself out of Egypt.
<br>17	Hear my supplication, and be merciful to thy lot and inheritance, and turn our mourning into joy, that we may live and praise thy name, O Lord, and shut not the mouths of them that sing to thee.
<br>18	And all Israel with like mind and supplica- tion cried to the Lord, because they saw certain death hanging over their heads.
<br>
<br>Chapter 14
<br>Queen Esther also, fearing the danger that was at hand, had recourse to the Lord.
<br>2	And when she had laid away her royal ap- parel, she put on garments suitable for weep- ing and mourning: instead of divers precious ointments, she covered her head with ashes and dung, and she humbled her body with fasts: and all the places in which before she was accustomed to rejoice, she filled with her torn hair.
<br>3	And she prayed to the Lord the God of Is- rael, saying: O my Lord, who alone art our king,
<br> 
<br>help me a desolate woman, and who have no other helper but thee.
<br>4	My danger is in my hands.
<br>5	I have heard of my father that thou, O Lord, didst take Israel from among all nations, and our fathers from all their predecessors, to pos- sess them as an everlasting inheritance, and thou hast done to them as thou hast promised.
<br>6	We have sinned in thy sight, and therefore thou hast delivered us into the hands of our en- emies:
<br>7	For we have worshipped their gods. Thou art just, O Lord.
<br>8	And now they are not content to oppress us with most hard bondage, but attributing the strength of their hands to the power of their idols.
<br>9	They design to change thy promises, and destroy thy inheritance, and shut the mouths of them that praise thee, and extinguish the glory of thy temple and altar,
<br>10	That they may open the mouths of Gen- tiles, and praise the strength of idols, and mag- nify for ever a carnal king.
<br>11	Give not, O Lord, thy sceptre to them that are not, lest they laugh at our ruin: but turn their counsel upon themselves, and destroy him that hath begun to rage against us.
<br>12	Remember, O Lord, and shew thyself to us in the time of our tribulation,  and give me boldness, O Lord, king of gods, and of all power: 13 Give me a well ordered speech in my mouth in the presence of the lion, and turn his heart to the hatred of our enemy, that both he himself
<br>may perish, and the rest that consent to him.
<br>14	But deliver us by thy hand, and help me, who have no other helper, but thee, O Lord, who hast the knowledge of all things.
<br>15	And thou knowest that I hate the glory of the wicked, and abhor the bed of the uncircum-
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>cised, and of every stranger.
<br>16	Thou knowest my necessity, that I abom- inate the sign of my pride and glory, which is upon my head in the days of my public appear- ance, and detest it as a menstruous rag, and wear it not in the days of my silence,
<br>17	And that I have not eaten at Amanâ€™s table, nor hath the kingâ€™s banquet pleased me, and that I have not drunk the wine of the drink offerings:
<br>18	And that thy handmaid hath never re- joiced, since I was brought hither unto this day but in thee, O Lord, the God of Abraham.
<br>19	O God, who art mighty above all, hear the voice of them, that have no other hope, and de- liver us from the hand of the wicked, and deliver me from my fear.
<br>
<br>Chapter 15
<br>And he commanded her (no doubt but he was Mardochai) to go to the king, and petition for her people, and for her country.
<br>2	Remember, (said he,) the days of thy low estate, how thou wast brought up by my hand, because Aman the second after the king hath spoken against us unto death.
<br>3	And do thou call upon the Lord, and speak to the king for us, and deliver us from death.
<br>4	And on the third day she laid away the gar- ments she wore, and put on her glorious apparel. 5 And glittering in royal robes, after she had called upon God the ruler and Saviour of all, she
<br>took two maids with her,
<br>6	And upon one of them she leaned, as if for delicateness and overmuch tenderness she were not able to bear up her own body.
<br>7	And the other maid followed her lady, bear- ing up her train flowing on the ground.
<br>8	But she with a rosy colour in her face, and
<br> 
<br>with gracious and bright eyes hid a mind full of anguish, and exceeding great fear.
<br>9	So going in she passed through all doors in order, and stood before the king, where he sat upon his royal throne, clothed with his royal robes, and glittering with gold, and precious stones, and he was terrible to behold.
<br>10	And when he had lifted up his countenance, and with burning eyes had shewn the wrath of his heart, the queen sunk down, and her colour turned pale, and she rested her weary head upon her handmaid.
<br>11	And God changed the kingâ€™s spirit into mildness, and all in haste and in fear he leaped from his throne, and holding her up in his arms, till she came to herself, caressed her with these words:
<br>12	What is the matter, Esther? I am thy brother, fear not.
<br>13	Thou shalt not die: for this law is not made for thee, but for all others.
<br>14	Come near then, and touch the sceptre.
<br>15	And as she held her peace, he took the golden sceptre, and laid it upon her neck, and kissed her, and said: Why dost thou not speak to me?
<br>16	She answered: I saw thee, my lord, as an angel of God, and my heart was troubled for fear of thy majesty.
<br>17	For thou, my lord, art very admirable, and thy face is full of graces.
<br>18	And while she was speaking, she fell down again, and was almost in a swoon.
<br>19	But the king was troubled, and all his ser- vants comforted her.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 16
<br>The great king Artaxerxes, from India to Ethiopia, to the governors and princes of a hun- dred and twenty-seven provinces, which obey our command, sendeth greeting.
<br>2	Many have abused unto pride the goodness of princes, and the honour that hath been be- stowed upon them:
<br>3	And not only endeavour to oppress the kingâ€™s subjects, but not bearing the glory that is given them, take in hand, to practise also against them that gave it.
<br>4	Neither are they content not to return thanks for benefits received, and to violate in themselves the laws of humanity, but they think they can also escape the justice of God who seeth all things.
<br>5	And they break out into so great madness, as to endeavour to undermine by lies such as observe diligently the offices committed to them, and do all things in such manner as to be worthy of all menâ€™s praise,
<br>6	While with crafty fraud they deceive the ears of princes that are well meaning, and judge of others by their own nature.
<br>7	Now this is proved both from ancient his- tories, and by the things which are done daily, how the good designs of kings are depraved by the evil suggestions of certain men.
<br>8	Wherefore we must provide for the peace of all provinces.
<br>9	Neither must you think, if we command dif- ferent things, that it cometh of the levity of our mind, but that we give sentence according to the quality and necessity of times, as the profit of the commonwealth requireth.
<br>10	Now that you may more plainly under- stand what we say, Aman the son of Amadathi, a Macedonian both in mind and country, and
<br> 
<br>having nothing of the Persian blood, but with his cruelty staining our goodness, was received being a stranger by us:
<br>11	And found our humanity so great towards him, that he was called our father, and was wor- shipped by all as the next man after the king:
<br>12	But he was so far puffed up with arrogancy, as to go about to deprive us of our kingdom and life.
<br>13	For with certain new and unheard of de- vices he hath sought the destruction of Mar- dochai, by whose fidelity and good services our life was saved, and of Esther the partner of our kingdom with all their nation:
<br>14	Thinking that after they were slain, he might work treason against us left alone with- out friends, and might transfer the kingdom of the Persians to the Macedonians.
<br>15	But we have found that the Jews, who were by that most wicked man appointed to be slain, are in no fault at all, but contrariwise, use just laws,
<br>16	And are the children of the highest and the greatest, and the ever living God, by whose ben- efit the kingdom was given both to our fathers and to us, and is kept unto this day.
<br>17	Wherefore know ye that those letters which he sent in our name, are void and of no effect.
<br>18	For which crime both he himself that de- vised it, and all his kindred hang on gibbets, before the gates of this city Susan: not we, but God repaying him as he deserved.
<br>19	But this edict, which we now send, shall be published in all cities, that the Jews may freely follow their own laws.
<br>20	And you shall aid them that they may kill those who had prepared themselves to kill them, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is called Adar.
<br> 
<br>
<br>21	For the almighty God hath turned this day of sadness and mourning into joy to them.
<br>22	Wherefore you shall also count this day among other festival days, and celebrate it with all joy, that it may be known also in times to come,
<br>23	That all they who faithfully obey the Per- sians, receive a worthy reward for their fidelity: but they that are traitors to their kingdom, are destroyed for their wickedness.
<br>24	And let every province and city, that will not be partaker of this solemnity, perish by the sword and by fire, and be destroyed in such man- ner as to be made unpassable, both to men and beasts, for an example of contempt, and disobe- dience.

<br>Book of Job
<br>
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>There was a man in the land of Hus, whose name was Job, and that man was simple and upright, and fearing God, and avoiding evil.
<br>2	And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters.
<br>3	And his possession was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hun- dred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a family exceedingly great: and this man was great among all the people of the east.
<br>4	And his sons went, and made a feast by houses, every one in his day. And sending, they called their three sisters, to eat and drink with them.
<br>5	And when the days of their feasting were gone about, Job sent to them, and sanctified them: and rising up early, offered holocausts for every one of them. For he said: Lest perhaps my sons have sinned, and have blessed God in their hearts. So did Job all days.
<br>6	Now on a certain day, when the sons of God came to stand before the Lord, Satan also was present among them.
<br>7	And the Lord said to him: Whence comest thou? And he answered and said: I have gone round about the earth, and walked through it.
<br>8	And the Lord said to him: Hast thou con- sidered my servant, Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a simple and upright man, and fearing God, and avoiding evil?
<br> 
<br>
<br>9	And Satan answering, said: Doth Job fear God in vain?
<br>10	Hast thou not made a fence for him, and his house, and all his substance round about, blessed the works of his hands, and his possession hath increased on the earth?
<br>11	But stretch forth thy hand a little, and touch all that he hath, and see if he bless thee not to thy face.
<br>12	Then the Lord said to Satan: Behold, all that he hath is in thy hand: only put not forth thy hand upon his person. And Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord.
<br>13	Now upon a certain day, when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine, in the house of their eldest brother,
<br>14	There came a messenger to Job, and said: The oxen were ploughing, and the asses feeding beside them,
<br>15	And the Sabeans rushed in, and took all away, and slew the servants with the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell thee.
<br>16	And while he was yet speaking, another came, and said: The fire of God fell from heaven, and striking the sheep and the servants, hath consumed them; and I alone have escaped to tell thee.
<br>17	And while he also was yet speaking, there came another, and said: The Chaldeans made three troops, and have fallen upon the camels, and taken them; moreover, they have slain the servants with the sword: and I alone have es-
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>caped to tell thee.
<br>18	He was yet speaking, and behold another came in, and said: Thy sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their eldest brother,
<br>19	A violent wind came on a sudden from the side of the desert, and shook the four corners of the house, and it fell upon thy children, and they are dead: and I alone have escaped to tell thee. 20 Then Job rose up, and rent his garments, and having shaven his head, fell down upon the
<br>ground, and worshipped,
<br>21	And said: Naked came I out of my motherâ€™s womb, and naked shall I return thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away: as it hath pleased the Lord, so is it done: blessed be the name of the Lord.
<br>22	In all these things Job sinned not by his lips, nor spoke he any foolish thing against God.
<br>
<br>Chapter 2
<br>And it came to pass, when on a certain day the sons of God came, and stood before the Lord, and Satan came amongst them, and stood in his sight,
<br>2	That the Lord said to Satan: Whence comest thou? And he answered, and said: I have gone round about the earth, and walked through it.
<br>3	And the Lord said to Satan: Hast thou con- sidered my servant, Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a man simple and upright, and fearing God, and avoiding evil, and still keeping his innocence? But thou hast moved me against him, that I should afflict him without cause.
<br>4	And Satan answered, and said: Skin for skin; and all that a man hath, he will give for his life: 5 But put forth thy hand, and touch his bone
<br> 
<br>and his flesh, and then thou shalt see that he will bless thee to thy face.
<br>6	And the Lord said to Satan: Behold, he is in thy hand, but yet save his life.
<br>7	So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord, and struck Job with a very grievous ulcer, from the sole of the foot even to the top of his head:
<br>8	And he took a potsherd and scraped the corrupt matter, sitting on a dunghill.
<br>9	And his wife said to him: Dost thou still continue in thy simplicity? bless God and die.
<br>10	And he said to her: Thou hast spoken like one of the foolish women: If we have received good things at the hand of God, why should we not receive evil? In all these things Job did not sin with his lips.
<br>11	Now when Jobâ€™s three friends heard all the evil that had befallen him, they came every one from his own place, Eliphaz, the Themanite, and Baldad, the Suhite, and Sophar, the Naamath- ite. For they had made an appointment to come together and visit him, and comfort him.
<br>12	And when they had lifted up their eyes afar off, they knew him not, and crying out, they wept, and rending their garments, they sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.
<br>13	And they sat with him on the ground seven day and seven nights and no man spoke to him a word: for they saw that his grief was very great.
<br>
<br>Chapter 3
<br>After this, Job opened his mouth, and cursed his day,
<br>2	And he said:
<br>3	Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said: A man child is conceived.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>4	Let that day be turned into darkness, let not God regard it from above, and let not the light shine upon it.
<br>5	Let darkness, and the shadow of death, cover it, let a mist overspread it, and let it be wrapped up in bitterness.
<br>6	Let a darksome whirlwind seize upon that night, let it not be counted in the days of the year, nor numbered in the months.
<br>7	Let that night be solitary, and not worthy of praise.
<br>8	Let them curse it who curse the day, who are ready to raise up a leviathan:
<br>9	Let the stars be darkened with the mist thereof: let it expect light, and not see it, nor the rising of the dawning of the day:
<br>10	Because it shut not up the doors of the womb that bore me, nor took away evils from my eyes.
<br>11	Why did I not die in the womb? why did I not perish when I came out of the belly?
<br>12	Why received upon the knees? why suckled at the breasts?
<br>13	For now I should have been asleep and still, and should have rest in my sleep:
<br>14	With kings and consuls of the earth, who build themselves solitudes:
<br>15	Or with princes, that possess gold, and fill their houses with silver:
<br>16	Or as a hidden untimely birth, I should not be; or as they that, being conceived, have not seen the light.
<br>17	There the wicked cease from tumult, and there the wearied in strength are at rest.
<br>18	And they sometime bound together with- out disquiet, have not heard the voice of the op- pressor.
<br>19	The small and great are there, and the ser- vant is free from his master.
<br> 
<br>20	Why is light given to him that is in misery, and life to them that are in bitterness of soul?
<br>21	That look for death, and it cometh not, as they that dig for a treasure:
<br>22	And they rejoice exceedingly when they have found the grave?
<br>23	To a man whose way is hidden, and God hath surrounded him with darkness?
<br>24	Before I eat I sigh: and as overflowing wa- ters, so is my roaring:
<br>25	For the fear which I feared, hath come upon me: and that which I was afraid of, hath befallen me.
<br>26	Have I not dissembled? have I not kept silence? have I not been quiet? and indignation is come upon me.
<br>
<br>Chapter 4
<br>Then Eliphaz, the Themanite, answered, and said:
<br>2	If we begin to speak to thee, perhaps thou wilt take it ill; but who can withhold the words he hath conceived?
<br>3	Behold thou hast taught many, and thou hast strengthened the weary hands:
<br>4	Thy words have confirmed them that were staggering, and thou hast strengthened the trem- bling knees:
<br>5	But now the scourge is come upon thee, and thou faintest: It hath touched thee, and thou art troubled.
<br>6	Where is thy fear, thy fortitude, thy pa- tience, and the perfection of thy ways?
<br>7	Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished being innocent? or when were the just de- stroyed?
<br>8	On the contrary, I have seen those who work iniquity, and sow sorrows, and reap them,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>9	Perishing by the blast of God, and consumed by the spirit of his wrath.
<br>10	The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the lioness, and the teeth of the whelps of lions, are broken:
<br>11	The tiger hath perished for want of prey, and the young lions are scattered abroad.
<br>12	Now there was a word spoken to me in pri- vate, and my ears by stealth, as it were, received the veins of its whisper.
<br>13	In the horror of a vision by night, when deep sleep is wont to hold men,
<br>14	Fear seized upon me, and trembling, and all my bones were affrighted:
<br>15	And when a spirit passed before me, the hair of my flesh stood up.
<br>16	There stood one whose countenance I knew not, an image before my eyes, and I heard the voice, as it were, of a gentle wind.
<br>17	Shall man be justified in comparison of God, or shall a man be more pure than his maker?
<br>18	Behold, they that serve him are not stead- fast, and in his angels he found wickedness:
<br>19	How much more shall they that dwell in houses of clay, who have an earthly foundation, be consumed as with the moth?
<br>20	From morning till evening they shall be cut down: and because no one understandeth, they shall perish for ever.
<br>21	And they that shall be left, shall be taken away from them: they shall die, and not in wis- dom.
<br>
<br>Chapter 5
<br>
<br>Call now, if there be any that will answer thee, and turn to some of the saints.
<br> 
<br>2	Anger indeed killeth the foolish, and envy slayeth the little one.
<br>3	I have seen a fool with a strong root, and I cursed his beauty immediately.
<br>4	His children shall be far from safety, and shall be destroyed in the gate, and there shall be none to deliver them.
<br>5	Whose harvest the hungry shall eat, and the armed man shall take him by violence, and the thirsty shall drink up his riches.
<br>6	Nothing upon earth is done without a cause, and sorrow doth not spring out of the ground.
<br>7	Man is born to labour, and the bird to fly.
<br>8	Wherefore I will pray to the Lord, and ad- dress my speech to God:
<br>9	Who doth great things, and unsearchable and wonderful things without number:
<br>10	Who giveth rain upon the face of the earth, and watereth all things with waters:
<br>11	Who setteth up the humble on high, and comforteth with health those that mourn.
<br>12	Who bringeth to nought the designs of the malignant, so that their hands cannot accom- plish what they had begun:
<br>13	Who catcheth the wise in their craftiness, and disappointeth the counsel of the wicked:
<br>14	They shall meet with darkness in the day, and grope at noonday as in the night.
<br>15	But he shall save the needy from the sword of their mouth, and the poor from the hand of the violent.
<br>16	And to the needy there shall be hope, but iniquity shall draw in her mouth.
<br>17	Blessed is the man whom God correcteth: refuse not, therefore, the chastising of the Lord. 18 For he woundeth, and cureth: he striketh,
<br>and his hands shall heal.
<br>19	In six troubles he shall deliver thee, and in the seventh, evil shall not touch thee.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>20	In famine he shall deliver thee from death; and in battle, from the hand of the sword.
<br>21	Thou shalt be hidden from the scourge of the tongue: and thou shalt not fear calamity when it cometh.
<br>22	In destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: and thou shalt not be afraid of the beasts of the earth.
<br>23	But thou shalt have a covenant with the stones of the lands, and the beasts of the earth shall be at peace with thee.
<br>24	And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle is in peace, and visiting thy beauty, thou shalt not sin.
<br>25	Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be multiplied, and thy offspring like the grass of the earth.
<br>26	Thou shalt enter into the grave in abun- dance, as a heap of wheat is brought in in its season.
<br>27	Behold, this is even so, as we have searched out: which thou having heard, consider it thor- oughly in thy mind.
<br>
<br>Chapter 6
<br>But Job answered, and said:
<br>2	O that my sins, whereby I have deserved wrath, and the calamity that I suffer, were weighed in a balance.
<br>3	As the sand of the sea, this would appear heavier: therefore, my words are full of sorrow:
<br>4	For the arrows of the Lord are in me, the rage whereof drinketh up my spirit, and the ter- rors of the Lord war against me.
<br>5	Will the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or will the ox low when he standeth before a full manger?
<br>6	Or can an unsavoury thing be eaten, that is
<br> 
<br>not seasoned with salt? or can a man taste that which, when tasted, bringeth death?
<br>7	The things which before my soul would not touch, now, through anguish, are my meats.
<br>8	Who will grant that my request may come: and that God may give me what I look for?
<br>9	And that he that hath begun may destroy me, that he may let loose his hand, and cut me off?
<br>10	And that this may be my comfort, that afflicting me with sorrow, he spare not, nor I contradict the words of the Holy one.
<br>11	For what is my strength, that I can hold out? or what is my end, that I should keep pa- tience?
<br>12	My strength is not the strength of stones, nor is my flesh of brass.
<br>13	Behold there is no help for me in myself, and my familiar friends also are departed from me.
<br>14	He that taketh away mercy from his friend, for saketh the fear of the Lord.
<br>15	My brethren have passed by me, as the torrent that passeth swiftly in the valleys.
<br>16	They that fear the hoary frost, the snow shall fall upon them.
<br>17	At the time when they shall be scattered they shall perish: and after it groweth hot, they shall be melted out of their place.
<br>18	The paths of their steps are entangled: they shall walk in vain, and shall perish.
<br>19	Consider the paths of Thema, the ways of Saba, and wait a little while.
<br>20	They arc confounded, because I have hoped: they are come also even unto me, and are covered with shame.
<br>21	Now you are come: and now, seeing my affliction, you are afraid.
<br>22	Did I say: Bring to me, and give me of your substance?
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>23	Or deliver me from the hand of the enemy, and rescue me out of the hand of the mighty?
<br>24	Teach me, and I will hold my peace: and if I have been ignorant of any thing, instruct me.
<br>25	Why have you detracted the words of truth, whereas there is none of you that can reprove me?
<br>26	You dress up speeches only to rebuke, and you utter words to the wind.
<br>27	You rush in upon the fatherless, and you endeavour to overthrow your friend.
<br>28	However, finish what you have begun: give ear and see whether I lie.
<br>29	Answer, I beseech you, without contention: and speaking that which is just, judge ye.
<br>30	And you shall not find iniquity in my tongue, neither shall folly sound in my mouth.
<br>
<br>Chapter 7
<br>The life of man upon earth is a warfare, and his days are like the days of a hireling.
<br>2	As a servant longeth for the shade, as the hireling looketh for the end of his work;
<br>3	So I also have had empty months, and have numbered to myself wearisome nights.
<br>4	If I lie down to sleep, I shall say: When shall I rise?  and again, I shall look for the evening, and shall be filled with sorrows even till darkness. 5 My flesh is clothed with rottenness and the filth of dust; my skin is withered and drawn to-
<br>gether.
<br>6	My days have passed more swiftly than the web is cut by the weaver, and are consumed with- out any hope.
<br>7	Remember that my life is but wind, and my eye shall not return to see good things.
<br>8	Nor shall the sight of man behold me: thy eyes are upon me, and I shall be no more.
<br> 
<br>9	As a cloud is consumed, and passeth away: so he that shall go down to hell shall not come up.
<br>10	Nor shall he return any more into his house, neither shall his place know him any more
<br>11	Wherefore, I will not spare my month, I will speak in the affliction of my spirit: I will talk with the bitterness of my soul.
<br>12	Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou hast inclosed me in a prison?
<br>13	If I say: My bed shall comfort me, and I shall be relieved, speaking with myself on my couch:
<br>14	Thou wilt frighten me with dreams, and terrify me with visions.
<br>15	So that my soul rather chooseth hanging, and my bones death.
<br>16	I have done with hope, I shall now live no longer: spare me, for my days are nothing.
<br>17	What is a man, that thou shouldst magnify him or why dost thou set thy heart upon him?
<br>18	Thou visitest him early in the morning, and thou provest him suddenly.
<br>19	How long wilt thou not spare me, nor suffer me to swallow down my spittle?
<br>20	I have sinned: what shall I do to thee, O keeper of men? why hast thou set me opposite to thee. and am I become burdensome to myself?
<br>21	Why dost thou not remove my sin, and why dost thou not take away my iniquity? Behold now I shall sleep in the dust: and if thou seek me in the morning, I shall not be.
<br>
<br>Chapter 8
<br>Then Baldad, the Suhite, answered, and said:
<br>2	How long wilt thou speak these things, and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>3	Doth God pervert judgment, or doth the Almighty overthrow that which is just?
<br>4	Although thy children have sinned against him, and he hath left them in the hand of their iniquity:
<br>5	Yet if thou wilt arise early to God, and wilt beseech the Almighty:
<br>6	If thou wilt walk clean and upright, he will presently awake unto thee, and will make the dwelling of thy justice peaceable:
<br>7	In so much, that if thy former things were small thy latter things would be multiplied ex- ceedingly.
<br>8	For inquire of the former generation, and search diligently into the memory of the fathers: 9 (For we are but of yesterday, and are igno- rant that our days upon earth are but a shadow 10 And they shall teach thee: they shall speak
<br>to thee, and utter words out of their hearts.
<br>11	Can the rush be green without moisture? or sedge bush grow without water?
<br>12	When it is yet in flower, and is not plucked u with the hand, it withereth before all herbs.
<br>13	Even so are the ways of all that forget God, an the hope of the hypocrite shall perish:
<br>14	His folly shall not please him, and his trust shall be like the spiderâ€™s web.
<br>15	He shall lean upon his house, and it shall no stand: he shall prop it up, and it shall not rise:
<br>16	He seemeth to have moisture before the sun cometh; and at his rising, his blossom shall shoot forth.
<br>17	His roots shall be thick upon a heap of stones; and among the stones he shall abide.
<br>18	If one swallow him up out of his place, he shall deny him, and shall say: I know thee not.
<br>19	For this is the joy of his way, that others may spring again out of the earth.
<br> 
<br>20	God will not cast away the simple, nor reach out his hand to the evil doer:
<br>21	Until thy mouth be filled with laughter, and thy lips with rejoicing.
<br>22	They that hate thee, shall be clothed with confusion: and the dwelling of the wicked shall not stand.
<br>
<br>Chapter 9
<br>
<br>And Job answered, and said:
<br>2	Indeed I know it is so, and that man cannot be justified, compared with God.
<br>3	If he will contend with him, he cannot an- swer him one for a thousand.
<br>4	He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath resisted him, and hath had peace?
<br>5	Who hath removed mountains, and they whom he overthrew in his wrath, knew it not.
<br>6	Who shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.
<br>7	Who commandeth the sun, and it riseth not: and shutteth up the stars, as it were, under a seal:
<br>8	Who alone spreadeth out the heavens, and walketh upon the waves of the sea
<br>9	Who maketh Arcturus, and Orion, and Hyades, and the inner parts of the south.
<br>10	Who doth things great and incomprehensi- ble, and wonderful, of which there is no number. 11 If he come to me, I shall not see him: if he
<br>depart, I shall not understand.
<br>12	If he examine on a sudden, who shall an- swer him? or who can say: Why dost thou so?
<br>13	God, whose wrath no man can resist, and under whom they stoop that bear up the world. 14 What am I then, that I should answer him,
<br>and have words with him?
