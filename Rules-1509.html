<br>§1415. Transfers pursuant to change in bargaining representative
<br>(a) Authority to transfer from old plan to new plan pursuant to employee participation in another multiemployer plan after certified change of representative
<br>
<br>In any case in which an employer has completely or partially withdrawn from a multiemployer plan (hereafter in this section referred to as the "old plan") as a result of a certified change of collective bargaining representative occurring after September 25, 1980, if participants of the old plan who are employed by the employer will, as a result of that change, participate in another multiemployer plan (hereafter in this section referred to as the "new plan"), the old plan shall transfer assets and liabilities to the new plan in accordance with this section.
<br>(b) Notification by employer of plan sponsor of old plan; notification by plan sponsor of old plan of employer and plan sponsor of new plan; appeal by new plan to prevent transfer; further proceedings
<br>
<br>(1) The employer shall notify the plan sponsor of the old plan of a change in multiemployer plan participation described in subsection (a) no later than 30 days after the employer determines that the change will occur.
<br>
<br>(2) The plan sponsor of the old plan shall—
<br>
<br>(A) notify the employer of—
<br>
<br>(i) the amount of the employer's withdrawal liability determined under part 1 of this subtitle with respect to the withdrawal,
<br>
<br>(ii) the old plan's intent to transfer to the new plan the nonforfeitable benefits of the employees who are no longer working in covered service under the old plan as a result of the change of bargaining representative, and
<br>
<br>(iii) the amount of assets and liabilities which are to be transferred to the new plan, and
<br>
<br>(B) notify the plan sponsor of the new plan of the benefits, assets, and liabilities which will be transferred to the new plan.
<br>
<br>(3) Within 60 days after receipt of the notice described in paragraph (2)(B), the new plan may file an appeal with the corporation to prevent the transfer. The transfer shall not be made if the corporation determines that the new plan would suffer substantial financial harm as a result of the transfer. Upon notification described in paragraph (2), if—
<br>
<br>(A) the employer fails to object to the transfer within 60 days after receipt of the notice described in paragraph (2)(A), or
<br>
<br>(B) the new plan either—
<br>
<br>(i) fails to file such an appeal, or
<br>
<br>(ii) the corporation, pursuant to such an appeal, fails to find that the new plan would suffer substantial financial harm as a result of the transfer described in the notice under paragraph (2)(B) within 180 days after the date on which the appeal is filed,
<br>
<br>then the plan sponsor of the old plan shall transfer the appropriate amount of assets and liabilities to the new plan.
<br>(c) Reduction of amount of withdrawal liability of employer upon transfer of appropriate amount of assets and liabilities by plan sponsor of old plan to new plan
<br>
<br>If the plan sponsor of the old plan transfers the appropriate amount of assets and liabilities under this section to the new plan, then the amount of the employer's withdrawal liability (as determined under section 1381(b) of this title without regard to such transfer and this section) with respect to the old plan shall be reduced by the amount by which—
<br>
<br>(1) the value of the unfunded vested benefits allocable to the employer which were transferred by the plan sponsor of the old plan to the new plan, exceeds
<br>
<br>(2) the value of the assets transferred.
<br>(d) Escrow payments by employer upon complete or partial withdrawal and prior to transfer
<br>
<br>In any case in which there is a complete or partial withdrawal described in subsection (a), if—
<br>
<br>(1) the new plan files an appeal with the corporation under subsection (b)(3), and
<br>
<br>(2) the employer is required by section 1399 of this title to begin making payments of withdrawal liability before the earlier of—
<br>
<br>(A) the date on which the corporation finds that the new plan would not suffer substantial financial harm as a result of the transfer, or
<br>
<br>(B) the last day of the 180-day period beginning on the date on which the new plan files its appeal,
<br>
<br>then the employer shall make such payments into an escrow held by a bank or similar financial institution satisfactory to the old plan. If the transfer is made, the amounts paid into the escrow shall be returned to the employer. If the transfer is not made, the amounts paid into the escrow shall be paid to the old plan and credited against the employer's withdrawal liability.
<br>(e) Prohibition on transfer of assets to new plan by plan sponsor of old plan; exemptions
<br>
<br>(1) Notwithstanding subsection (b), the plan sponsor shall not transfer any assets to the new plan if—
<br>
<br>(A) the old plan is in reorganization (within the meaning of section 1421(a) 1 of this title), or
<br>
<br>(B) the transfer of assets would cause the old plan to go into reorganization (within the meaning of section 1421(a) 1 of this title).
<br>
<br>(2) In any case in which a transfer of assets from the old plan to the new plan is prohibited by paragraph (1), the plan sponsor of the old plan shall transfer—
<br>
<br>(A) all nonforfeitable benefits described in subsection (b)(2), if the value of such benefits does not exceed the withdrawal liability of the employer with respect to such withdrawal, or
<br>
<br>(B) such nonforfeitable benefits having a value equal to the withdrawal liability of the employer, if the value of such benefits exceeds the withdrawal liability of the employer.
<br>(f) Agreement between plan sponsors of old plan and new plan to transfer in compliance with other statutory provisions; reduction of withdrawal liability of employer from old plan; amount of withdrawal liability of employer to new plan
<br>
<br>(1) Notwithstanding subsections (b) and (e), the plan sponsors of the old plan and the new plan may agree to a transfer of assets and liabilities that complies with sections 1411 and 1414 of this title, rather than this section, except that the employer's liability with respect to the withdrawal from the old plan shall be reduced under subsection (c) as if assets and liabilities had been transferred in accordance with this section.
<br>
<br>(2) If the employer withdraws from the new plan within 240 months after the effective date of a transfer of assets and liabilities described in this section, the amount of the employer's withdrawal liability to the new plan shall be the greater of—
<br>
<br>(A) the employer's withdrawal liability determined under part 1 of this subtitle with respect to the new plan, or
<br>
<br>(B) the amount by which the employer's withdrawal liability to the old plan was reduced under subsection (c), reduced by 5 percent for each 12-month period following the effective date of the transfer and ending before the date of the withdrawal from the new plan.
<br>(g) Definitions
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section—
<br>
<br>(1) "appropriate amount of assets" means the amount by which the value of the nonforfeitable benefits to be transferred exceeds the amount of the employer's withdrawal liability to the old plan (determined under part 1 of this subtitle without regard to section 1391(e) of this title), and

<br>§1426. Insolvent plans
<br>(a) Suspension of payments of benefits; conditions, amount, etc.
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding sections 1053 and 1054 of this title, in any case in which benefit payments under an insolvent multiemployer plan exceed the resource benefit level, any such payments of benefits which are not basic benefits shall be suspended, in accordance with this section, to the extent necessary to reduce the sum of such payments and the payments of such basic benefits to the greater of the resource benefit level or the level of basic benefits, unless an alternative procedure is prescribed by the corporation under section 1322a(g)(5) of this title.
<br>(b) Determination of insolvency status for plan year; definitions
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, for a plan year—
<br>
<br>(1) a multiemployer plan is insolvent if the plan's available resources are not sufficient to pay benefits under the plan when due for the plan year, or if the plan is determined to be insolvent under subsection (d);
<br>
<br>(2) "resource benefit level" means the level of monthly benefits determined under subsections (c)(1) and (3) and (d)(3) to be the highest level which can be paid out of the plan's available resources;
<br>
<br>(3) "available resources" means the plan's cash, marketable assets, contributions, withdrawal liability payments, and earnings, less reasonable administrative expenses and amounts owed for such plan year to the corporation under section 1431(b)(2) of this title; and
<br>
<br>(4) "insolvency year" means a plan year in which a plan is insolvent.
<br>(c) Determination by plan sponsor of plan in critical status of resource benefit level of plan for each insolvency year; uniform application of suspension of benefits; adjustments of benefit payments
<br>
<br>(1) The plan sponsor of a plan in critical status, as described in subsection 1 1085(b)(2) of this title, shall determine in writing the plan's resource benefit level for each insolvency year, based on the plan sponsor's reasonable projection of the plan's available resources and the benefits payable under the plan.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) The suspension of benefit payments under this section shall, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, apply in substantially uniform proportions to the benefits of all persons in pay status under the plan, except that the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe rules under which benefit suspensions for different participant groups may be varied equitably to reflect variations in contribution rates and other relevant factors including differences in negotiated levels of financial support for plan benefit obligations.
<br>
<br>(B) For purposes of this paragraph—
<br>
<br>(i) the term "person in pay status" means—
<br>
<br>(I) a participant or beneficiary on the last day of the base plan year who, at any time during such year, was paid an early, late, normal, or disability retirement benefit (or a death benefit related to a retirement benefit), and
<br>
<br>(II) to the extent provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, any other person who is entitled to such a benefit under the plan.
<br>
<br>(ii) the base plan year for any plan year is—
<br>
<br>(I) if there is a relevant collective bargaining agreement, the last plan year ending at least 6 months before the relevant effective date, or
<br>
<br>(II) if there is no relevant collective bargaining agreement, the last plan year ending at least 12 months before the beginning of the plan year.
<br>
<br>(iii) a relevant collective bargaining agreement is a collective bargaining agreement—
<br>
<br>(I) which is in effect for at least 6 months during the plan year, and
<br>
<br>(II) which has not been in effect for more than 36 months as of the end of the plan year.
<br>
<br>(iv) the relevant effective date is the earliest of the effective dates for the relevant collective bargaining agreements.
<br>
<br>(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (2), if a plan sponsor determines in writing a resource benefit level for a plan year which is below the level of basic benefits, the payment of all benefits other than basic benefits must be suspended for that plan year.
<br>
<br>(4)(A) If, by the end of an insolvency year, the plan sponsor determines in writing that the plan's available resources in that insolvency year could have supported benefit payments above the resource benefit level for that insolvency year, the plan sponsor shall distribute the excess resources to the participants and beneficiaries who received benefit payments from the plan in that insolvency year, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.
<br>
<br>(B) For purposes of this paragraph, the term "excess resources" means available resources above the amount necessary to support the resource benefit level, but no greater than the amount necessary to pay benefits for the plan year at the benefit levels under the plan.
<br>
<br>(5) If, by the end of an insolvency year, any benefit has not been paid at the resource benefit level, amounts up to the resource benefit level which were unpaid shall be distributed to the participants and beneficiaries, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, to the extent possible taking into account the plan's total available resources in that insolvency year.
<br>
<br>(6) Except as provided in paragraph (4) or (5), a plan is not required to make retroactive benefit payments with respect to that portion of a benefit which was suspended under this section.
<br>(d) Applicability and determinations respecting plan assets; time for determinations of resource benefit level and level of basic benefits
<br>
<br>(1) As of the end of the first plan year in which a plan is in critical status, as described in subsection 1 1085(b)(2) of this title,,2 and at least every 3 plan years thereafter (unless the plan is no longer in critical status, as described in subsection 1 1085(b)(2) of this title,),2 the plan sponsor shall compare the value of plan assets for that plan year with the total amount of benefit payments made under the plan for that plan year. Unless the plan sponsor determines that the value of plan assets exceeds 3 times the total amount of benefit payments, the plan sponsor shall determine whether the plan will be insolvent in any of the next 5 plan years. If the plan sponsor makes such a determination that the plan will be insolvent in any of the next 5 plan years, the plan sponsor shall make the comparison under this paragraph at least annually until the plan sponsor makes a determination that the plan will not be insolvent in any of the next 5 plan years.
<br>
<br>(2) If, at any time, the plan sponsor of a plan in critical status, as described in subsection 1 1085(b)(2) of this title, reasonably determines, taking into account the plan's recent and anticipated financial experience, that the plan's available resources are not sufficient to pay benefits under the plan when due for the next plan year, the plan sponsor shall make such determination available to interested parties.
<br>
<br>(3) The plan sponsor of a plan in critical status, as described in subsection 1 1085(b)(2) of this title, shall determine in writing for each insolvency year the resource benefit level and the level of basic benefits no later than 3 months before the insolvency year.
<br>
<br>(4) For purposes of this subsection, the value of plan assets shall be the value of the available plan assets determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.
<br>(e) Notice, etc., requirements of plan sponsor of plan in critical status regarding insolvency and resource benefit levels
<br>
<br>(1) If the plan sponsor of a plan in critical status, as described in subsection 1 1085(b)(2) of this title, determines under subsection (d)(1) or (2) that the plan may become insolvent (within the meaning of subsection (b)(1)), the plan sponsor shall—
<br>
<br>(A) notify the Secretary of the Treasury,3 the parties described in section 1021(f)(1) of this title of that determination, and
<br>
<br>(B) inform the parties described in section 1021(f)(1) of this title that if insolvency occurs certain benefit payments will be suspended, but that basic benefits will continue to be paid.
<br>
<br>(2) No later than 2 months before the first day of each insolvency year, the plan sponsor of a plan in critical status, as described in subsection 1 1085(b)(2) of this title, shall notify the Secretary of the Treasury, the corporation, and the parties described in paragraph (1)(B) of the resource benefit level determined in writing for that insolvency year.
<br>
<br>(3) In any case in which the plan sponsor anticipates that the resource benefit level for an insolvency year may not exceed the level of basic benefits, the plan sponsor shall notify the corporation.
<br>
<br>(4) Notice required by this subsection shall be given in accordance with regulations prescribed by the corporation, except that notice to the Secretary of the Treasury shall be given in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.
<br>
<br>(5) The corporation may prescribe a time other than the time prescribed by this section for the making of a determination or the filing of a notice under this section.
<br>(f) Financial assistance from corporation; conditions and criteria applicable
<br>
<br>(1) If the plan sponsor of an insolvent plan, for which the resource benefit level is above the level of basic benefits, anticipates that, for any month in an insolvency year, the plan will not have funds sufficient to pay basic benefits, the plan sponsor may apply for financial assistance from the corporation under section 1431 of this title.
<br>
<br>(2) A plan sponsor who has determined a resource benefit level for an insolvency year which is below the level of basic benefits shall apply for financial assistance from the corporation under section 1431 of this title.
<br>(g) Application of subsections (a) and (c)
<br>
<br>Subsections (a) and (c) shall not apply to a plan that, for the plan year, is operating under section 1085(e)(9) of this title, regarding benefit suspensions by certain multiemployer plans in critical and declining status.

<br>
<br>"(i) the plan would have been eligible for the overburden credit in the last plan year beginning before the date of the enactment of this Act [Sept. 26, 1980], if section 4243 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 [former section 1423 of this title] had been in effect for that plan year, and

<br>(a) Amendment of plan by plan sponsor to reduce benefits, and suspension of benefit payments
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding sections 1053 and 1054 of this title, the plan sponsor of a terminated multiemployer plan to which section 1341a(d) of this title applies shall amend the plan to reduce benefits, and shall suspend benefit payments, as required by this section.
<br>(b) Determinations respecting value of nonforfeitable benefits under terminated plan and value of assets of plan
<br>
<br>(1) The value of nonforfeitable benefits under a terminated plan referred to in subsection (a), and the value of the plan's assets, shall be determined in writing, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the corporation, as of the end of the plan year during which section 1341a(d) of this title becomes applicable to the plan, and each plan year thereafter.
<br>
<br>(2) For purposes of this section, plan assets include outstanding claims for withdrawal liability (within the meaning of section 1301(a)(12) of this title).
<br>(c) Amendment of plan by plan sponsor to reduce benefits for conservation of assets; factors applicable
<br>
<br>(1) If, according to the determination made under subsection (b), the value of nonforfeitable benefits exceeds the value of the plan's assets, the plan sponsor shall amend the plan to reduce benefits under the plan to the extent necessary to ensure that the plan's assets are sufficient, as determined and certified in accordance with regulations prescribed by the corporation, to discharge when due all of the plan's obligations with respect to nonforfeitable benefits.
<br>
<br>(2) Any plan amendment required by this subsection shall, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury—
<br>
<br>(A) reduce benefits only to the extent necessary to comply with paragraph (1);
<br>
<br>(B) reduce accrued benefits only to the extent that those benefits are not eligible for the corporation's guarantee under section 1322a(b) of this title;
<br>
<br>(C) comply with the rules for and limitations on benefit reductions under a plan in reorganization, as prescribed in section 1425 1 of this title, except to the extent that the corporation prescribes other rules and limitations in regulations under this section; and
<br>
<br>(D) take effect no later than 6 months after the end of the plan year for which it is determined that the value of nonforfeitable benefits exceeds the value of the plan's assets.
<br>(d) Suspension of benefit payments; determinative factors; powers and duties of plan sponsor; retroactive benefit payments
<br>
<br>(1) In any case in which benefit payments under a plan which is insolvent under paragraph (2)(A) exceed the resource benefit level, any such payments which are not basic benefits shall be suspended, in accordance with this subsection, to the extent necessary to reduce the sum of such payments and such basic benefits to the greater of the resource benefit level or the level of basic benefits, unless an alternative procedure is prescribed by the corporation in connection with a supplemental guarantee program established under section 1322a(g)(2) of this title.
<br>
<br>(2) For purposes of this subsection, for a plan year—
<br>
<br>(A) a plan is insolvent if—
<br>
<br>(i) the plan has been amended to reduce benefits to the extent permitted by subsection (c), and
<br>
<br>(ii) the plan's available resources are not sufficient to pay benefits under the plan when due for the plan year; and
<br>
<br>(B) "resource benefit level" and "available resources" have the meanings set forth in paragraphs (2) and (3), respectively, of section 1426(b) of this title.
<br>
<br>(3) The plan sponsor of a plan which is insolvent (within the meaning of paragraph (2)(A)) shall have the powers and duties of the plan sponsor of a plan in reorganization which is insolvent (within the meaning of section 1426(b)(1) of this title), except that regulations governing the plan sponsor's exercise of those powers and duties under this section shall be prescribed by the corporation, and the corporation shall prescribe by regulation notice requirements which assure that plan participants and beneficiaries receive adequate notice of benefit suspensions.
<br>
<br>(4) A plan is not required to make retroactive benefit payments with respect to that portion of a benefit which was suspended under this subsection, except that the provisions of section 1426(c)(4) and (5) of this title shall apply in the case of plans which are insolvent under paragraph (2)(A), in connection with the plan year during which such section 1341a(d) of this title first became applicable to the plan and every year thereafter, in the same manner and to the same extent as such provisions apply to insolvent plans in reorganization under section 1426 of this title, in connection with insolvency years under such section 1426 of this title.

<br>Pub. L. 96–364, title I, §104(1), Sept. 26, 1980, 94 Stat. 1217, substituted "Subtitle F—Transition Rules and Effective Dates" for "Subtitle E—Effective Date; Special Rules".
<br>§1461. Effective date; special rules
<br>
<br>(a) The provisions of this subchapter take effect on September 2, 1974.
<br>
<br>(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a), the corporation shall pay benefits guaranteed under this subchapter with respect to any plan—
<br>
<br>(1) which is not a multiemployer plan,
<br>
<br>(2) which terminates after June 30, 1974, and before September 2, 1974,
<br>
<br>(3) to which section 1321 of this title would apply if that section were effective beginning on July 1, 1974, and
<br>
<br>(4) with respect to which a notice is filed with the Secretary of Labor and received by him not later than 10 days after September 2, 1974, except that, for reasonable cause shown, such notice may be filed with the Secretary of Labor and received by him not later than October 31, 1974, stating that the plan is a plan described in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3).
<br>
<br>The corporation shall not pay benefits guaranteed under this subchapter with respect to a plan described in the preceding sentence unless the corporation finds substantial evidence that the plan was terminated for a reasonable business purpose and not for the purpose of obtaining the payment of benefits by the corporation under this subchapter or for the purpose of avoiding the liability which might be imposed under subtitle D if the plan terminated on or after September 2, 1974. The provisions of subtitle D do not apply in the case of such a plan which terminates before September 2, 1974. For purposes of determining whether a plan is a plan described in paragraph (2), the provisions of section 1348 of this title shall not apply, but the corporation shall make the determination on the basis of the date on which benefits ceased to accrue or on any other reasonable basis consistent with the purposes of this subsection.
<br>
<br>(c)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (2), (3), and (4), the corporation shall not pay benefits guaranteed under this subchapter with respect to a multiemployer plan which terminates before August 1, 1980. Whenever the corporation exercises the authority granted under paragraph (2) or (3), the corporation shall notify the Committee on Education and Labor and the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, and the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare and the Committee on Finance of the Senate.
<br>
<br>(2) The corporation may, in its discretion, pay benefits guaranteed under this subchapter with respect to a multiemployer plan which terminates after September 2, 1974 and before August 1, 1980, if—
<br>
<br>(A) the plan was maintained during the 60 months immediately preceding the date on which the plan terminates, and
<br>
<br>(B) the corporation determines that the payment by the corporation of benefits guaranteed under this subchapter with respect to that plan will not jeopardize the payments the corporation anticipates it may be required to make in connection with benefits guaranteed under this subchapter with respect to multiemployer plans which terminate after July 31, 1980.
<br>
<br>(3) Notwithstanding any provision of section 1321 or 1322 of this title which would prevent such payments, the corporation, in carrying out its authority under paragraph (2), may pay benefits guaranteed under this subchapter with respect to a multiemployer plan described in paragraph (2) in any case in which those benefits would otherwise not be payable if—
<br>
<br>(A) the plan has been in effect for at least 5 years,
<br>
<br>(B) the plan has been in substantial compliance with the funding requirements for a qualified plan with respect to the employees and former employees in those employment units on the basis of which the participating employers have contributed to the plan for the preceding 5 years, and
<br>
<br>(C) the participating employers and employee organization or organizations had no reasonable recourse other than termination.
<br>
<br>(4) If the corporation determines, under paragraph (2) or (3), that it will pay benefits guaranteed under this subchapter with respect to a multiemployer plan which terminates before August 1, 1980, the corporation—
<br>
<br>(A) may establish requirements for the continuation of payments which commenced before January 2, 1974, with respect to retired participants under the plan,
<br>
<br>(B) may not, notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, make payments with respect to any participant under such a plan who, on January 1, 1974, was receiving payment of retirement benefits, in excess of the amounts and rates payable with respect to such participant on that date,
<br>
<br>(C) shall review from time to time payments made under the authority granted to it by paragraphs (2) and (3), and reduce or terminate such payments to the extent necessary to avoid jeopardizing the ability of the corporation to make payments of benefits guaranteed under this subchapter in connection with multiemployer plans which terminate after July 31, 1980, without increasing premium rates for such plans.
<br>
<br>(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, guaranteed benefits payable by the corporation pursuant to its discretionary authority under this section shall continue to be paid at the level guaranteed under section 1322 of this title, without regard to any limitation on payment under subparagraph (C) of subsection (c)(4).
<br>
<br>(e)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (2), (3), and (4), the amendments to this chapter made by the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980 shall take effect on September 26, 1980.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) Except as provided in this paragraph, part 1 of subtitle E, relating to withdrawal liability, takes effect on September 26, 1980.
<br>
<br>(B) For purposes of determining withdrawal liability under part 1 of subtitle E, an employer who has withdrawn from a plan shall be considered to have withdrawn from a multiemployer plan if, at the time of the withdrawal, the plan was a multiemployer plan as defined in section 1301(a)(3) of this title as in effect at the time of the withdrawal.
<br>
<br>(3) Sections 1421 through 1426 1 of this title, relating to multiemployer plan reorganization, shall take effect, with respect to each plan, on the first day of the first plan year beginning on or after the earlier of—
<br>
<br>(A) the date on which the last collective bargaining agreement providing for employer contributions under the plan, which was in effect on September 26, 1980, expires, without regard to extensions agreed to on or after September 26, 1980, or
<br>
<br>(B) 3 years after September 26, 1980.
<br>
<br>(4) Section 1415 of this title shall take effect on September 26, 1980.
<br>
<br>(f)(1) In the event that before September 26, 1980, the corporation has determined that—
<br>
<br>(A) an employer has withdrawn from a multiemployer plan under section 1363 of this title, and
<br>
<br>(B) the employer is liable to the corporation under such section,
<br>
<br>the corporation shall retain the amount of liability paid to it or furnished in the form of a bond and shall pay such liability to the plan in the event the plan terminates in accordance with section 1341a(a)(2) of this title before the earlier of September 26, 1985, or the day after the 5-year period commencing on the date of such withdrawal.
<br>
<br>(2) In any case in which the plan is not so terminated within the period described in paragraph (1), the liability of the employer is abated and any payment held in escrow shall be refunded without interest to the employer or the employer's bond shall be cancelled.
<br>
<br>(g)(1) In any case in which an employer or employers withdrew from a multiemployer plan before the effective date of part 1 of subtitle E, the corporation may—
<br>
<br>(A) apply section 1363(d) of this title, as in effect before the amendments made by the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, to such plan,
<br>
<br>(B) assess liability against the withdrawn employer with respect to the resulting terminated plan,
<br>
<br>(C) guarantee benefits under the terminated plan under section 1322 of this title, as in effect before such amendments, and
<br>
<br>(D) if necessary, enforce such action through suit brought under section 1303 of this title.
<br>
<br>(2) The corporation shall use the revolving fund used by the corporation with respect to basic benefits guaranteed under section 1322a of this title in guaranteeing benefits under a terminated plan described in this subsection.
<br>
<br>(h)(1) In the case of an employer who entered into a collective bargaining agreement—
<br>
<br>(A) which was effective on January 12, 1979, and which remained in effect through May 15, 1982, and
<br>
<br>(B) under which contributions to a multiemployer plan were to cease on January 12, 1982,
<br>
<br>any withdrawal liability incurred by the employer pursuant to part 1 of subtitle E as a result of the complete or partial withdrawal of the employer from the multiemployer plan before January 16, 1982, shall be void.
<br>
<br>(2) In any case in which—
<br>
<br>(A) an employer engaged in the grocery wholesaling business—
<br>
<br>(i) had ceased all covered operations under a multiemployer plan before June 30, 1981, and had relocated its operations to a new facility in another State, and
<br>
<br>(ii) had notified a local union representative on May 14, 1980, that the employer had tentatively decided to discontinue operations and relocate to a new facility in another State, and
<br>
<br>(B) all State and local approvals with respect to construction of and commencement of operations at the new facility had been obtained, a contract for construction had been entered into, and construction of the new facility had begun before September 26, 1980,
<br>
<br>any withdrawal liability incurred by the employer pursuant to part 1 of subtitle E as a result of the complete or partial withdrawal of the employer from the multiemployer plan before June 30, 1981, shall be void.
<br>
<br>(i) The preceding provisions of this section shall not apply with respect to amendments made to this subchapter in provisions enacted after October 22, 1986.
