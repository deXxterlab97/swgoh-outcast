<br>§5701. Findings and declarations
<br>
<br>The Congress makes the following findings and declarations:
<br>
<br>(1) The Congress recognizes that under the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration:
<br>
<br>(A) The People's Republic of China and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland have agreed that the People's Republic of China will resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997. Until that time, the United Kingdom will be responsible for the administration of Hong Kong.
<br>
<br>(B) The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, beginning on July 1, 1997, will continue to enjoy a high degree of autonomy on all matters other than defense and foreign affairs.
<br>
<br>(C) There is provision for implementation of a "one country, two systems" policy, under which Hong Kong will retain its current lifestyle and legal, social, and economic systems until at least the year 2047.
<br>
<br>(D) The legislature of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will be constituted by elections, and the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, as applied to Hong Kong, shall remain in force.
<br>
<br>(E) Provision is made for the continuation in force of agreements implemented as of June 30, 1997, and for the ability of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to conclude new agreements either on its own or with the assistance of the Government of the People's Republic of China.
<br>
<br>(2) The Congress declares its wish to see full implementation of the provisions of the Joint Declaration.
<br>
<br>(3) The President has announced his support for the policies and decisions reflected in the Joint Declaration.
<br>
<br>(4) Hong Kong plays an important role in today's regional and world economy. This role is reflected in strong economic, cultural, and other ties with the United States that give the United States a strong interest in the continued vitality, prosperity, and stability of Hong Kong.
<br>
<br>(5) Support for democratization is a fundamental principle of United States foreign policy. As such, it naturally applies to United States policy toward Hong Kong. This will remain equally true after June 30, 1997.
<br>
<br>(6) The human rights of the people of Hong Kong are of great importance to the United States and are directly relevant to United States interests in Hong Kong. A fully successful transition in the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong must safeguard human rights in and of themselves. Human rights also serve as a basis for Hong Kong's continued economic prosperity.

<br>"SEC. 3. FINDINGS.
<br>
<br>"Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>"(1) The Joint Declaration and the Basic Law clarify certain obligations and promises that the Government of China has made with respect to the future of Hong Kong.
<br>
<br>"(2) The obligations of the Government of China under the Joint Declaration were codified in a legally-binding treaty, signed by the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and registered with the United Nations.
<br>
<br>"(3) The obligations of the Government of China under the Basic Law originate from the Joint Declaration, were passed into the domestic law of China by the National People's Congress, and are widely considered by citizens of Hong Kong as part of the de facto legal constitution of Hong Kong.
<br>
<br>"(4) Foremost among the obligations of the Government of China to Hong Kong is the promise that, pursuant to Paragraph 3b of the Joint Declaration, 'the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will enjoy a high degree of autonomy, except in foreign and defence affairs which are the responsibilities of the Central People's Government'.
<br>
<br>"(5) The obligation specified in Paragraph 3b of the Joint Declaration is referenced, reinforced, and extrapolated on in several portions of the Basic Law, including Articles 2, 12, 13, 14, and 22.
<br>
<br>"(6) Article 22 of the Basic Law establishes that 'No department of the Central People's Government and no province, autonomous region, or municipality directly under the Central Government may interfere in the affairs which the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region administers on its own in accordance with this Law.'.
<br>
<br>"(7) The Joint Declaration and the Basic Law make clear that additional obligations shall be undertaken by China to ensure the 'high degree of autonomy' of Hong Kong.
<br>
<br>"(8) Paragraph 3c of the Joint Declaration states, as reinforced by Articles 2, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 22 of the Basic Law, that Hong Kong 'will be vested with executive, legislative and independent judicial power, including that of final adjudication'.
<br>
<br>"(9) On multiple occasions, the Government of China has undertaken actions that have contravened the letter or intent of the obligation described in paragraph (8) of this section, including the following:
<br>
<br>"(A) In 1999, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress overruled a decision by the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal on the right of abode.
<br>
<br>"(B) On multiple occasions, the Government of Hong Kong, at the advice of the Government of China, is suspected to have not allowed persons entry into Hong Kong allegedly because of their support for democracy and human rights in Hong Kong and China.
<br>
<br>"(C) The Liaison Office of China in Hong Kong has, despite restrictions on interference in the affairs of Hong Kong as detailed in Article 22 of the Basic Law—
<br>
<br>"(i) openly expressed support for candidates in Hong Kong for Chief Executive and Legislative Council;
<br>
<br>"(ii) expressed views on various policies for the Government of Hong Kong and other internal matters relating to Hong Kong; and
<br>
<br>"(iii) on April 17, 2020, asserted that both the Liaison Office of China in Hong Kong and the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office of the State Council 'have the right to exercise supervision * * * on affairs regarding Hong Kong and the mainland, in order to ensure correct implementation of the Basic Law'.
<br>
<br>"(D) The National People's Congress has passed laws requiring Hong Kong to pass laws banning disrespectful treatment of the national flag and national anthem of China.
<br>
<br>"(E) The State Council of China released a white paper on June 10, 2014, that stressed the 'comprehensive jurisdiction' of the Government of China over Hong Kong and indicated that Hong Kong must be governed by 'patriots'.
<br>
<br>"(F) The Government of China has directed operatives to kidnap and bring to the mainland, or is otherwise responsible for the kidnapping of, residents of Hong Kong, including businessman Xiao Jianhua and bookseller Gui Minhai.
<br>
<br>"(G) The Government of Hong Kong, acting with the support of the Government of China, introduced an extradition bill that would have permitted the Government of China to request and enforce extradition requests for any individual present in Hong Kong, regardless of the legality of the request or the degree to which it compromised the judicial independence of Hong Kong.
<br>
<br>"(H) The spokesman for the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress said, 'Whether Hong Kong's laws are consistent with the Basic Law can only be judged and decided by the National People's Congress Standing Committee. No other authority has the right to make judgments and decisions.'.
<br>
<br>"(10) Paragraph 3e of the Joint Declaration states, as reinforced by Article 5 of the Basic Law, that the 'current social and economic systems in Hong Kong will remain unchanged, as so will the life-style.'.
<br>
<br>"(11) On multiple occasions, the Government of China has undertaken actions that have contravened the letter or intent of the obligation described in paragraph (10) of this section, including the following:
<br>
<br>"(A) In 2002, the Government of China pressured the Government of Hong Kong to introduce 'patriotic' curriculum in primary and secondary schools.
<br>
<br>"(B) The governments of China and Hong Kong proposed the prohibition of discussion of Hong Kong independence and self-determination in primary and secondary schools, which infringes on freedom of speech.
<br>
<br>"(C) The Government of Hong Kong mandated that Mandarin, and not the native language of Cantonese, be the language of instruction in Hong Kong schools.
<br>
<br>"(D) The governments of China and Hong Kong agreed to a daily quota of mainland immigrants to Hong Kong, which is widely believed by citizens of Hong Kong to be part of an effort to 'mainlandize' Hong Kong.
<br>
<br>"(12) Paragraph 3e of the Joint Declaration states, as reinforced by Articles 4, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32[,] 33, 34, and 39 of the Basic Law, that the 'rights and freedoms, including those of person, of speech, of the press, of assembly, of association, of travel, of movement, of correspondence, of strike, of choice of occupation, of academic research and of religious belief will be ensured by law' in Hong Kong.
<br>
<br>"(13) On multiple occasions, the Government of China has undertaken actions that have contravened the letter or intent of the obligation described in paragraph (12) of this section, including the following:
<br>
<br>"(A) On February 26, 2003, the Government of Hong Kong introduced a national security bill that would have placed restrictions on freedom of speech and other protected rights.
<br>
<br>"(B) The Liaison Office of China in Hong Kong has pressured businesses in Hong Kong not to advertise in newspapers and magazines critical of the governments of China and Hong Kong.
<br>
<br>"(C) The Hong Kong Police Force selectively blocked demonstrations and protests expressing opposition to the governments of China and Hong Kong or the policies of those governments.
<br>
<br>"(D) The Government of Hong Kong refused to renew [a] work visa for a foreign journalist, allegedly for hosting a speaker from the banned Hong Kong National Party.
<br>
<br>"(E) The Justice Department of Hong Kong selectively prosecuted cases against leaders of the Umbrella Movement, while failing to prosecute police officers accused of using excessive force during the protests in 2014.
<br>
<br>"(F) On April 18, 2020, the Hong Kong Police Force arrested 14 high-profile democracy activists and campaigners for their role in organizing a protest march that took place on August 18, 2019, in which almost 2,000,000 people rallied against a proposed extradition bill.
<br>
<br>"(14) Articles 45 and 68 of the Basic Law assert that the selection of Chief Executive and all members of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong should be by 'universal suffrage.'.
<br>
<br>"(15) On multiple occasions, the Government of China has undertaken actions that have contravened the letter or intent of the obligation described in paragraph (14) of this section, including the following:
<br>
<br>"(A) In 2004, the National People's Congress created new, antidemocratic procedures restricting the adoption of universal suffrage for the election of the Chief Executive of Hong Kong.
<br>
<br>"(B) The decision by the National People's Congress on December 29, 2007, which ruled out universal suffrage in 2012 elections and set restrictions on when and if universal suffrage will be implemented.
<br>
<br>"(C) The decision by the National People's Congress on August 31, 2014, which placed limits on the nomination process for the Chief Executive of Hong Kong as a condition for adoption of universal suffrage.
<br>
<br>"(D) On November 7, 2016, the National People's Congress interpreted Article 104 of the Basic Law in such a way to disqualify 6 elected members of the Legislative Council.
<br>
<br>"(E) In 2018, the Government of Hong Kong banned the Hong Kong National Party and blocked the candidacy of pro-democracy candidates.
<br>
<br>"(16) The ways in which the Government of China, at times with the support of a subservient Government of Hong Kong, has acted in contravention of its obligations under the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law, as set forth in this section, are deeply concerning to the people of Hong Kong, the United States, and members of the international community who support the autonomy of Hong Kong.
<br>"SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING HONG KONG.
<br>
<br>"It is the sense of Congress that—
<br>
<br>"(1) the United States continues to uphold the principles and policy established in the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 [Pub. L. 102–383] (22 U.S.C. 5701 et seq.) and the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 (Public Law 116–76; 22 U.S.C. 5701 note), which remain consistent with China's obligations under the Joint Declaration and certain promulgated objectives under the Basic Law, including that—
<br>
<br>"(A) as set forth in section 101(1) of the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 (22 U.S.C. 5711(1)), 'The United States should play an active role, before, on, and after July 1, 1997, in maintaining Hong Kong's confidence and prosperity, Hong Kong's role as an international financial center, and the mutually beneficial ties between the people of the United States and the people of Hong Kong.'; and
<br>
<br>"(B) as set forth in section 2(5) of the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 (22 U.S.C. 5701(5)), 'Support for democratization is a fundamental principle of United States foreign policy. As such, it naturally applies to United States policy toward Hong Kong. This will remain equally true after June 30, 1997.';
<br>
<br>"(2) although the United States recognizes that, under the Joint Declaration, the Government of China 'resumed the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong with effect on 1 July 1997', the United States supports the autonomy of Hong Kong in furtherance of the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 and the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 and advances the desire of the people of Hong Kong to continue the 'one country, two systems' regime, in addition to other obligations promulgated by China under the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law;
<br>
<br>"(3) in order to support the benefits and protections that Hong Kong has been afforded by the Government of China under the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law, the United States should establish a clear and unambiguous set of penalties with respect to foreign persons determined by the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, to be involved in the contravention of the obligations of China under the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law and the financial institutions transacting with those foreign persons;
<br>
<br>"(4) the Secretary of State should provide an unclassified assessment of the reason for imposition of certain economic penalties on entities, so as to permit a clear path for the removal of economic penalties if the sanctioned behavior is reversed and verified by the Secretary of State;
<br>
<br>"(5) relevant Federal agencies should establish a multilateral sanctions regime with respect to foreign persons involved in the contravention of the obligations of China under the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law; and
<br>
<br>"(6) in addition to the penalties on foreign persons, and financial institutions transacting with those foreign persons, for the contravention of the obligations of China under the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law, the United States should take steps, in a time of crisis, to assist permanent residents of Hong Kong who are persecuted or fear persecution as a result of the contravention by China of its obligations under the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law to become eligible to obtain lawful entry into the United States.
<br>"SEC. 5. IDENTIFICATION OF FOREIGN PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE EROSION OF THE OBLIGATIONS OF CHINA UNDER THE JOINT DECLARATION OR THE BASIC LAW AND FOREIGN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT CONDUCT SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS WITH THOSE PERSONS.
<br>
<br>"(a) In General.—Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act [July 14, 2020], if the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, determines that a foreign person is materially contributing to, has materially contributed to, or attempts to materially contribute to the failure of the Government of China to meet its obligations under the Joint Declaration or the Basic Law, the Secretary of State shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees and leadership a report that includes—
<br>
<br>"(1) an identification of the foreign person; and
<br>
<br>"(2) a clear explanation for why the foreign person was identified and a description of the activity that resulted in the identification.
<br>
<br>"(b) Identifying Foreign Financial Institutions.—Not earlier than 30 days and not later than 60 days after the Secretary of State submits to the appropriate congressional committees and leadership the report under subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees and leadership a report that identifies any foreign financial institution that knowingly conducts a significant transaction with a foreign person identified in the report under subsection (a).
<br>
<br>"(c) Exclusion of Certain Information.—
<br>
<br>"(1) Intelligence.—The Secretary of State shall not disclose the identity of a person in a report submitted under subsection (a) or (b), or an update under subsection (e), if the Director of National Intelligence determines that such disclosure could compromise an intelligence operation, activity, source, or method of the United States.
<br>
<br>"(2) Law enforcement.—The Secretary of State shall not disclose the identity of a person in a report submitted under subsection (a) or (b), or an update under subsection (e), if the Attorney General, in coordination, as appropriate, with the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the head of any other appropriate Federal law enforcement agency, and the Secretary of the Treasury, determines that such disclosure could reasonably be expected—
<br>
<br>"(A) to compromise the identity of a confidential source, including a State, local, or foreign agency or authority or any private institution that furnished information on a confidential basis;
<br>
<br>"(B) to jeopardize the integrity or success of an ongoing criminal investigation or prosecution;
<br>
<br>"(C) to endanger the life or physical safety of any person; or
<br>
<br>"(D) to cause substantial harm to physical property.
<br>
<br>"(3) Notification required.—If the Director of National Intelligence makes a determination under paragraph (1) or the Attorney General makes a determination under paragraph (2), the Director or the Attorney General, as the case may be, shall notify the appropriate congressional committees and leadership of the determination and the reasons for the determination.

<br>
<br>"(1) Foreign persons.—The President may exclude a foreign person from the report under subsection (a), or an update under subsection (e), or remove a foreign person from the report or update prior to the imposition of sanctions under section 6(a) if the material contribution (as described in subsection (g)) that merited inclusion in that report or update—
<br>
<br>"(A) does not have a significant and lasting negative effect that contravenes the obligations of China under the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law;
<br>
<br>"(B) is not likely to be repeated in the future; and
<br>
<br>"(C) has been reversed or otherwise mitigated through positive countermeasures taken by that foreign person.
<br>
<br>"(2) Foreign financial institutions.—The President may exclude a foreign financial institution from the report under subsection (b), or an update under subsection (e), or remove a foreign financial institution from the report or update prior to the imposition of sanctions under section 7(a) if the significant transaction or significant transactions of the foreign financial institution that merited inclusion in that report or update—
<br>
<br>"(A) does not have a significant and lasting negative effect that contravenes the obligations of China under the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law;
<br>
<br>"(B) is not likely to be repeated in the future; and
<br>
<br>"(C) has been reversed or otherwise mitigated through positive countermeasures taken by that foreign financial institution.
<br>
<br>"(3) Notification required.—If the President makes a determination under paragraph (1) or (2) to exclude or remove a foreign person or foreign financial institution from a report under subsection (a) or (b), as the case may be, the President shall notify the appropriate congressional committees and leadership of the determination and the reasons for the determination.

<br>
<br>"(2) Rule of construction.—Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to terminate the requirement to update the reports under subsections (a) and (b) upon the termination of the requirement to submit the annual report under section 301 of the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 (22 U.S.C. 5731).
<br>

<br>
<br>"(g) Material Contributions Related to Obligations of China Described.—For purposes of this section, a foreign person materially contributes to the failure of the Government of China to meet its obligations under the Joint Declaration or the Basic Law if the person—
<br>
<br>"(1) took action that resulted in the inability of the people of Hong Kong—
<br>
<br>"(A) to enjoy freedom of assembly, speech, press, or independent rule of law; or
<br>
<br>"(B) to participate in democratic outcomes; or
<br>
<br>"(2) otherwise took action that reduces the high degree of autonomy of Hong Kong.

<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13936. The President's Executive Order on Hong Kong Normalization
<br>
<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13936, July 14, 2020, 85 F.R. 43413, provided:
<br>
<br>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 (Public Law 102–393 [102–383]) [22 U.S.C. 5701 et seq.], the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 (Public Law 116–76) [see Short Title of 2019 Amendment note set out above], the Hong Kong Autonomy Act of 2020, signed into law July 14, 2020 [set out as a note above], the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) (NEA), section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (8 U.S.C. 1182(f)), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code,
<br>
<br>I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, determine, pursuant to section 202 of the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 [22 U.S.C. 5722], that the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong (Hong Kong) is no longer sufficiently autonomous to justify differential treatment in relation to the People's Republic of China (PRC or China) under the particular United States laws and provisions thereof set out in this order. In late May 2020, the National People's Congress of China announced its intention to unilaterally and arbitrarily impose national security legislation on Hong Kong. This announcement was merely China's latest salvo in a series of actions that have increasingly denied autonomy and freedoms that China promised to the people of Hong Kong under the 1984 Joint Declaration of the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the People's Republic of China on the Question of Hong Kong (Joint Declaration). As a result, on May 27, 2020, the Secretary of State announced that the PRC had fundamentally undermined Hong Kong's autonomy and certified and reported to the Congress, pursuant to sections 205 and 301 of the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 [22 U.S.C. 5725 and 5731], as amended, respectively, that Hong Kong no longer warrants treatment under United States law in the same manner as United States laws were applied to Hong Kong before July 1, 1997. On May 29, 2020, I directed the heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies) to begin the process of eliminating policy exemptions under United States law that give Hong Kong differential treatment in relation to China.
<br>
<br>China has since followed through on its threat to impose national security legislation on Hong Kong. Under this law, the people of Hong Kong may face life in prison for what China considers to be acts of secession or subversion of state power—which may include acts like last year's widespread anti-government protests. The right to trial by jury may be suspended. Proceedings may be conducted in secret. China has given itself broad power to initiate and control the prosecutions of the people of Hong Kong through the new Office for Safeguarding National Security. At the same time, the law allows foreigners to be expelled if China merely suspects them of violating the law, potentially making it harder for journalists, human rights organizations, and other outside groups to hold the PRC accountable for its treatment of the people of Hong Kong.
<br>
<br>I therefore determine that the situation with respect to Hong Kong, including recent actions taken by the PRC to fundamentally undermine Hong Kong's autonomy, constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. I hereby declare a national emergency with respect to that threat.
<br>
<br>In light of the foregoing, I hereby determine and order:
<br>
<br>Section 1. It shall be the policy of the United States to suspend or eliminate different and preferential treatment for Hong Kong to the extent permitted by law and in the national security, foreign policy, and economic interest of the United States.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. Pursuant to section 202 of the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 (22 U.S.C. 5722), I hereby suspend the application of section 201(a) of the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992, as amended (22 U.S.C. 5721(a)), to the following statutes:
<br>
<br>(a) section 103 of the Immigration Act of 1990 [Pub. L. 101–649] (8 U.S.C. 1152 note);
<br>
<br>(b) sections 203(c), 212(l), and 221(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, as amended (8 U.S.C. 1153(c), 1182(l), and 1201(c), respectively);
<br>
<br>(c) the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.);
<br>
<br>(d) section 721(m) of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (50 U.S.C. 4565(m));
<br>
<br>(e) the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 (50 U.S.C. 4801 et seq.); and
<br>
<br>(f) section 1304 of title 19, United States Code.
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. Within 15 days of the date of this order [July 14, 2020], the heads of agencies shall commence all appropriate actions to further the purposes of this order, consistent with applicable law, including, to:
<br>
<br>(a) amend any regulations implementing those provisions specified in section 2 of this order, and, consistent with applicable law and executive orders, under IEEPA, which provide different treatment for Hong Kong as compared to China;
<br>
<br>(b) amend the regulation at 8 CFR 212.4(i) to eliminate the preference for Hong Kong passport holders as compared to PRC passport holders;
<br>
<br>(c) revoke license exceptions for exports to Hong Kong, reexports to Hong Kong, and transfers (in-country) within Hong Kong of items subject to the Export Administration Regulations, 15 CFR Parts 730–774, that provide differential treatment compared to those license exceptions applicable to exports to China, reexports to China, and transfers (in-country) within China;
<br>
<br>(d) consistent with section 902(b)(2) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 (Public Law 101–246) [22 U.S.C. 2151 note], terminate the export licensing suspensions under section 902(a)(3) of such Act insofar as such suspensions apply to exports of defense articles to Hong Kong persons who are physically located outside of Hong Kong and the PRC and who were authorized to receive defense articles prior to the date of this order;
<br>
<br>(e) give notice of intent to suspend the Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Hong Kong for the Surrender of Fugitive Offenders (TIAS 98–121);
<br>
<br>(f) give notice of intent to terminate the Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Hong Kong for the Transfer of Sentenced Persons (TIAS 99–418);
<br>
<br>(g) take steps to end the provision of training to members of the Hong Kong Police Force or other Hong Kong security services at the Department of State's International Law Enforcement Academies;
<br>
<br>(h) suspend continued cooperation undertaken consistent with the now-expired Protocol Between the U.S. Geological Survey of the Department of the Interior of the United States of America and Institute of Space and Earth Information Science of the Chinese University of Hong Kong Concerning Scientific and Technical Cooperation in Earth Sciences (TIAS 09–1109);
<br>
<br>(i) take steps to terminate the Fulbright exchange program with regard to China and Hong Kong with respect to future exchanges for participants traveling both from and to China or Hong Kong;
<br>
<br>(j) give notice of intent to terminate the agreement for the reciprocal exemption with respect to taxes on income from the international operation of ships effected by the Exchange of Notes Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Hong Kong (TIAS 11892);
<br>
<br>(k) reallocate admissions within the refugee ceiling set by the annual Presidential Determination to residents of Hong Kong based on humanitarian concerns, to the extent feasible and consistent with applicable law; and
<br>
<br>(l) propose for my consideration any further actions deemed necessary and prudent to end special conditions and preferential treatment for Hong Kong.
<br>
<br>Sec. 4. All property and interests in property that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States person, of the following persons are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in:
<br>
<br>(a) Any foreign person determined by the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, or the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State:
<br>
<br>(i) to be or have been involved, directly or indirectly, in the coercing, arresting, detaining, or imprisoning of individuals under the authority of, or to be or have been responsible for or involved in developing, adopting, or implementing, the Law of the People's Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Administrative Region;
<br>
<br>(ii) to be responsible for or complicit in, or to have engaged in, directly or indirectly, any of the following:
<br>
<br>(A) actions or policies that undermine democratic processes or institutions in Hong Kong;
<br>
<br>(B) actions or policies that threaten the peace, security, stability, or autonomy of Hong Kong;
<br>
<br>(C) censorship or other activities with respect to Hong Kong that prohibit, limit, or penalize the exercise of freedom of expression or assembly by citizens of Hong Kong, or that limit access to free and independent print, online or broadcast media; or
<br>
<br>(D) the extrajudicial rendition, arbitrary detention, or torture of any person in Hong Kong or other gross violations of internationally recognized human rights or serious human rights abuse in Hong Kong;
<br>
<br>(iii) to be or have been a leader or official of:
<br>
<br>(A) an entity, including any government entity, that has engaged in, or whose members have engaged in, any of the activities described in subsections (a)(i), (a)(ii)(A), (a)(ii)(B), or (a)(ii)(C) of this section; or
<br>
<br>(B) an entity whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order.
<br>
<br>(iv) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this section;
<br>
<br>(v) to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this section; or
<br>
<br>(vi) to be a member of the board of directors or a senior executive officer of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this section.
<br>
<br>(b) The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section apply except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted before the date of this order.
<br>
<br>Sec. 5. I hereby determine that the making of donations of the types of articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to section 4 of this order would seriously impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in this order, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by section 4 of this order.
<br>
<br>Sec. 6. The prohibitions in section 4(a) of this order include:
<br>
<br>(a) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to section 4(a) of this order; and
<br>
<br>(b) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.
<br>
<br>Sec. 7. The unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens determined to meet one or more of the criteria in section 4(a) of this order, as well as immediate family members of such aliens, or aliens determined by the Secretary of State to be employed by, or acting as an agent of, such aliens, would be detrimental to the interest of the United States, and the entry of such persons into the United States, as immigrants and nonimmigrants, is hereby suspended. Such persons shall be treated as persons covered by section 1 of Proclamation 8693 of July 24, 2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens Subject to United Nations Security Council Travel Bans and International Emergency Economic Powers Act Sanctions) [8 U.S.C. 1182 note]. The Secretary of State shall have the responsibility of implementing this section pursuant to such conditions and procedures as the Secretary has established or may establish pursuant to Proclamation 8693.
<br>
<br>Sec. 8. (a) Any transaction that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.
<br>
<br>(b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.
<br>
<br>Sec. 9. Nothing in this order shall prohibit transactions for the conduct of the official business of the Federal Government by employees, grantees, or contractors thereof.
<br>
<br>Sec. 10. For the purposes of this order:
<br>
<br>(a) the term "person" means an individual or entity;
<br>
<br>(b) the term "entity" means a government or instrumentality of such government, partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization, including an international organization;
<br>
<br>(c) the term "United States person" means any United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign branches), or any person in the United States; and
<br>
<br>(d) The term "immediate family member" means spouses and children of any age.
<br>
<br>Sec. 11. For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to section 4 of this order would render those measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in this order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 4 of this order.
<br>
<br>Sec. 12. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including adopting rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to me by IEEPA as may be necessary to implement this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may, consistent with applicable law, redelegate any of these functions within the Department of the Treasury. All departments and agencies of the United States shall take all appropriate measures within their authority to implement this order.
<br>
<br>Sec. 13. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to submit recurring and final reports to the Congress on the national emergency declared in this order, consistent with section 401(c) of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)) and section 204(c) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)).
<br>
<br>Sec. 14. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
<br>
<br>(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency; or
<br>
<br>(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
<br>
<br>(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
<br>
<br>(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
<br>
<br>Sec. 15. If, based on consideration of the terms, obligations, and expectations expressed in the Joint Declaration, I determine that changes in China's actions ensure that Hong Kong is sufficiently autonomous to justify differential treatment in relation to the PRC under United States law, I will reconsider the determinations made and actions taken and directed under this order.

<br>SUBCHAPTER I—POLICY
<br>§5711. Bilateral ties between United States and Hong Kong
<br>
<br>It is the sense of the Congress that the following, which are based in part on the relevant provisions of the Joint Declaration, should be the policy of the United States with respect to its bilateral relationship with Hong Kong:
<br>
<br>(1) The United States should play an active role, before, on, and after July 1, 1997, in maintaining Hong Kong's confidence and prosperity, Hong Kong's role as an international financial center, and the mutually beneficial ties between the people of the United States and the people of Hong Kong.
<br>

<br>
<br>(3) The United States should seek to maintain, after June 30, 1997, the United States consulate-general in Hong Kong, together with other official and semi-official organizations, such as the United States Information Agency American Library.

<br>
<br>(5) The United States should recognize passports and travel documents issued after June 30, 1997, by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
<br>
<br>(6) The resumption by the People's Republic of China of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong after June 30, 1997, should not affect treatment of Hong Kong residents who apply for visas to visit or reside permanently in the United States, so long as such treatment is consistent with the Immigration and Nationality Act [8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.].

<br>
<br>It is the sense of the Congress that the following, which are based in part on the relevant provisions of the Joint Declaration, should be the policy of the United States with respect to Hong Kong after June 30, 1997:
<br>
<br>(1) The United States should support Hong Kong's participation in all appropriate multilateral conferences, agreements, and organizations in which Hong Kong is eligible to participate.
<br>
<br>(2) The United States should continue to fulfill its obligations to Hong Kong under international agreements, so long as Hong Kong reciprocates, regardless of whether the People's Republic of China is a party to the particular international agreement, unless and until such obligations are modified or terminated in accordance with law.
<br>
<br>(3) The United States should respect Hong Kong's status as a separate customs territory, and as a WTO member country (as defined in section 3501(10) of title 19), whether or not the People's Republic of China participates in the World Trade Organization (as defined in section 3501(8) of title 19).

<br>§5713. Commerce between United States and Hong Kong
<br>
<br>It is the sense of the Congress that the following, which are based in part on the relevant provisions of the Joint Declaration, are and should continue after June 30, 1997, to be the policy of the United States with respect to commerce between the United States and Hong Kong:
<br>
<br>(1) The United States should seek to maintain and expand economic and trade relations with Hong Kong and should continue to treat Hong Kong as a separate territory in economic and trade matters, such as import quotas and certificates of origin.
<br>
<br>(2) The United States should continue to negotiate directly with Hong Kong to conclude bilateral economic agreements.
<br>
<br>(3) The United States should continue to treat Hong Kong as a territory which is fully autonomous from the United Kingdom and, after June 30, 1997, should treat Hong Kong as a territory which is fully autonomous from the People's Republic of China with respect to economic and trade matters.
<br>
<br>(4) The United States should continue to grant the products of Hong Kong nondiscriminatory trade treatment by virtue of Hong Kong's membership in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
<br>
<br>(5) The United States should recognize certificates of origin for manufactured goods issued by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
<br>
<br>(6) The United States should continue to allow the United States dollar to be freely exchanged with the Hong Kong dollar.
<br>
<br>(7) United States businesses should be encouraged to continue to operate in Hong Kong, in accordance with applicable United States and Hong Kong law.
<br>
<br>(8) The United States should continue to support access by Hong Kong to sensitive technologies controlled under the agreement of the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (commonly referred to as "COCOM") for so long as the United States is satisfied that such technologies are protected from improper use or export.
<br>
<br>(9) The United States should encourage Hong Kong to continue its efforts to develop a framework which provides adequate protection for intellectual property rights.
<br>
<br>(10) The United States should negotiate a bilateral investment treaty directly with Hong Kong, in consultation with the Government of the People's Republic of China.
<br>
<br>(11) The change in the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong should not affect ownership in any property, tangible or intangible, held in the United States by any Hong Kong person.
