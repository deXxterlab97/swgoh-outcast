<br>8	But he that possesseth a mind, loveth his own soul, and he that keepeth prudence, shall find good things.
<br>9	A false witness shall not be unpunished: and he that speaketh lies, shall perish.
<br>10	Delicacies are not seemly for a fool: nor for a servant to have rule over princes.
<br>11	The learning of a man is known by pa- tience: and his glory is to pass over wrongs.
<br>12	As the roaring of a lion, so also is the anger of a king: and his cheerfulness as the dew upon the grass.
<br>13	A foolish son is the grief of his father: and a wrangling wife is like a roof continually dropping through.
<br>14	House and riches are given by parents: but a prudent wife is properly from the Lord.
<br>15	Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep, and an idle soul shall suffer hunger.
<br>16	He that keepeth the commandment, keep- eth his own soul: but he that neglecteth his own way, shall die.
<br>17	He that hath mercy on the poor, lendeth to the Lord: and he will repay him.
<br>18	Chastise thy son, despair not: but to the killing of him set not thy soul.
<br>19	He that is impatient, shall suffer damage: and when he shall take away, he shall add an- other thing.
<br>20	Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayst be wise in thy latter end.
<br> 
<br>21	There are many thoughts in the heart of a man: but the will of the Lord shall stand firm.
<br>22	A needy man is merciful: and better is the poor than the lying man.
<br>23	The fear of the Lord is unto life: and he shall abide in the fulness without being visited with evil.
<br>24	The slothful hideth his hand under his armpit, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth.
<br>25	The wicked man being scourged, the fool shall be wiser: but if thou rebuke a wise man, he will understand discipline.
<br>26	He that afflicteth his father, and chaseth away his mother, is infamous and unhappy.
<br>27	Cease not, O my son, to hear instruction, and be not ignorant of the words of knowledge. 28 An unjust witness scorneth judgment: and
<br>the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity.
<br>29 Judgments are prepared for scorners: and striking hammers for the bodies of fools.
<br>
<br>Chapter 20
<br>
<br>Wine is a luxurious thing, and drunkenness ri- otous: whosoever is delighted therewith, shall not be wise.
<br>2	As the roaring of a lion, so also is the dread of a king: he that provoketh him, sinneth against his own soul.
<br>3	It is an honour for a man to separate himself from quarrels: but all fools are meddling with reproaches.
<br>4	Because of the cold the sluggard would not plough: he shall beg therefore in the summer, and it shall not be given him.
<br>5	Counsel in the heart of a man is like deep water: but a wise man will draw it out.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>6	Many men are called merciful: but who shall find a faithful man?
<br>7	The just that walketh in his simplicity, shall leave behind him blessed children.
<br>8	The king, that sitteth on the throne of judg- ment, scattereth away all evil with his look.
<br>9	Who can say: My heart is clean, I am pure from sin?
<br>10	Diverse weights and diverse measures, both are abominable before God.
<br>11	By his inclinations a child is known, if his works be clean and right.
<br>12	The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the Lord hath made them both.
<br>13	Love not sleep, lest poverty oppress thee: open thy eyes, and be filled with bread.
<br>14	It is naught, it is naught, saith every buyer: and when he is gone away, then he will boast.
<br>15	There is gold and a multitude of jewels: but the lips of knowledge are a precious vessel.
<br>16	Take away the garment of him that is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge from him for strangers.
<br>17	The bread of lying is sweet to a man:  but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel. 18 Designs are strengthened by counsels: and
<br>wars are to be managed by governments.
<br>19	Meddle not with him that revealeth secrets, and walketh deceitfully, and openeth wide his lips.
<br>20	He that curseth his father, and mother, his lamp shall be put out in the midst of darkness. 21 The inheritance gotten hastily in the be-
<br>ginning, in the end shall be without a blessing.
<br>22	Say not: I will return evil: wait for the Lord, and he will deliver thee.
<br>23	Diverse weights are an abomination before the Lord: a deceitful balance is not good.
<br>24	The steps of men are guided by the Lord: but who is the man that can understand his own
<br> 
<br>way?
<br>25	It is ruin to a man to devour holy ones, and after vows to retract.
<br>26	A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth over them the wheel.
<br>27	The spirit of a man is the lamp of the Lord, which searcheth all the hidden things of the bow- els.
<br>28	Mercy and truth preserve the king, and his throne is strengthened by clemency.
<br>29	The joy of young men is their strength: and the dignity of old men, their grey hairs.
<br>30	The blueness of a wound shall wipe away evils: and stripes in the more inward parts of the belly.
<br>
<br>Chapter 21
<br>As the divisions of waters, so the heart of the king is in the hand of the Lord: whithersoever he will, he shall turn it.
<br>2	Every way of a man seemeth right to himself: but the Lord weigheth the hearts.
<br>3	To do mercy and judgment, pleaseth the Lord more than victims.
<br>4	Haughtiness of the eyes is the enlarging of the heart: the lamp of the wicked is sin.
<br>5	The thoughts of the industrious always bring forth abundance: but every sluggard is always in want.
<br>6	He that gathereth treasures by a lying tongue, is vain and foolish, and shall stumble upon the snares of death.
<br>7	The robberies of the wicked shall be their downfall, because they would not do judgment. 8 The perverse way of a man is strange: but
<br>as for him that is pure, his work is right.
<br>9 It is better to sit in a corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman, and in a common
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>house.
<br>10	The soul of the wicked desireth evil, he will not have pity on his neighbour.
<br>11	When a pestilent man is punished, the little one will be wiser: and if he follow the wise, he will receive knowledge.
<br>12	The just considereth seriously the house of the wicked, that he may withdraw the wicked from evil.
<br>13	He that stoppeth his ear against the cry of the poor, shall also cry himself, and shall not be heard.
<br>14	A secret present quencheth anger: and a gift in the bosom, the greatest wrath.
<br>15	It is joy to the just to do judgment: and dread to them that work iniquity.
<br>16	A man that shall wander out of the way of doctrine, shall abide in the company of the giants.
<br>17	He that loveth good cheer, shall be in want: he that loveth wine, and fat things, shall not be rich.
<br>18	The wicked is delivered up for the just: and the unjust for the righteous.
<br>19	It is better to dwell in a wilderness, than with a quarrelsome and passionate woman.
<br>20	There is a treasure to be desired, and oil in the dwelling of the just: and the foolish man shall spend it.
<br>21	He that followeth justice and mercy, shall find life, justice, and glory.
<br>22	The wise man hath scaled the city of the strong, and hath cast down the strength of the confidence thereof.
<br>23	He that keepeth his mouth and his tongue, keepeth his soul from distress.
<br>24	The proud and the arrogant is called igno- rant, who in anger worketh pride.
<br>25	Desires kill the slothful: for his hands have refused to work at all.
<br> 
<br>26	He longeth and desireth all the day: but he that is just, will give, and will not cease.
<br>27	The sacrifices of the wicked are abom- inable, because they are offered of wickedness.
<br>28	A lying witness shall perish: an obedient man shall speak of victory.
<br>29	The wicked man impudently hardeneth his face: but he that is righteous, correcteth his way. 30 There is no wisdom, there is no prudence,
<br>there is no counsel against the Lord.
<br>31 The horse is prepared for the day of battle: but the Lord giveth safety.
<br>
<br>Chapter 22
<br>
<br>A good name is better than great riches: and good favour is above silver and gold.
<br>2	The rich and poor have met one another: the Lord is the maker of them both.
<br>3	The prudent man saw the evil, and hid him- self: the simple passed on, and suffered loss.
<br>4	The fruit of humility is the fear of the Lord, riches and glory and life.
<br>5	Arms and swords are in the way of the per- verse: but he that keepeth his own soul, de- parteth far from them.
<br>6	It is a proverb: A young man according to his way, even when he is old, he will not depart from it.
<br>7	The rich ruleth over the poor: and the bor- rower is servant to him that lendeth.
<br>8	He that soweth iniquity, shall reap evils, and with the rod of his anger he shall be consumed. 9 He that is inclined to mercy, shall be blessed: for of his bread he hath given to the poor. He that maketh presents, shall purchase victory and honour: but he carrieth away the souls of the
<br>receivers.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>10	Cast out the scoffer, and contention shall go out with him, and quarrels and reproaches shall cease.
<br>11	He that loveth cleanness of heart, for the grace of his lips shall have the king for his friend. 12 The eyes of the Lord preserve knowledge:
<br>and the words of the unjust are overthrown.
<br>13	The slothful man saith: There is a lion without, I shall be slain in the midst of the streets.
<br>14	The mouth of a strange woman is a deep pit: he whom the Lord is angry with, shall fall into it.
<br>15	Folly is bound up in the heart of a child, and the rod of correction shall drive it away.
<br>16	He that oppresseth the poor, to increase his own riches, shall himself give to one that is richer, and shall be in need.
<br>17	Incline thy ear, and hear the words of the wise: and apply thy heart to my doctrine:
<br>18	Which shall be beautiful for thee, if thou keep it in thy bowels, and it shall flow in thy lips: 19 That thy trust may be in the Lord, where-
<br>fore I have also shewn it to thee this day.
<br>20	Behold I have described it to thee three manner of ways, in thoughts and knowledge:
<br>21	That I might shew thee the certainty, and the words of truth, to answer out of these to them that sent thee.
<br>22	Do no violence to the poor, because he is poor: and do not oppress the needy in the gate: 23 Because the Lord will judge his cause: and
<br>will afflict them that have afflicted his soul.
<br>24	Be not a friend to an angry man, and do not walk with a furious man:
<br>25	Lest perhaps thou learn his ways, and take scandal to thy soul.
<br>26	Be not with them that fasten down their hands, and that offer themselves sureties for debts:
<br> 
<br>27	For if thou have not wherewith to restore, what cause is there that he should take the cov- ering from thy bed?
<br>28	Pass not beyond the ancient bounds which thy fathers have set.
<br>29	Hast thou seen a man swift in his work? he shall stand before kings, and shall not be before those that are obscure.
<br>
<br>Chapter 23
<br>
<br>When thou shalt sit to eat with a prince, con- sider diligently what is set before thy face:
<br>2	And put a knife to thy throat, if it be so that thou have thy soul in thy own power.
<br>3	Be not desirous of his meats, in which is the bread of deceit.
<br>4	Labour not to be rich: but set bounds to thy prudence.
<br>5	Lift not up thy eyes to riches which thou canst not have: because they shall make them- selves wings like those of an eagle, and shall fly towards heaven.
<br>6	Eat not with an envious man, and desire not his meats:
<br>7	Because, like a soothsayer, and diviner, he thinketh that which he knoweth not. Eat and drink, will he say to thee: and his mind is not with thee.
<br>8	The meats which thou hadst eaten, thou shalt vomit up: and shalt lose thy beantiful words.
<br>9	Speak not in the ears of fools: because they will despise the instruction of thy speech.
<br>10	Touch not the bounds of little ones: and enter not into the field of the fatherless:
<br>11	For their near kinsman is strong: and he will judge their cause against thee.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>12	Let thy heart apply itself to instruction and thy ears to words of knowledge.
<br>13	Withhold not correction from a child: for if thou strike him with the rod, he shall not die. 14 Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and de-
<br>liver his soul from hell.
<br>15	My son, if thy mind be wise, my heart shall rejoice with thee:
<br>16	And my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips shall speak what is right.
<br>17	Let not thy heart envy sinners: but be thou in the fear of the Lord all the day long:
<br>18	Because thou shalt have hope in the lat- ter end, and thy expectation shall not be taken away.
<br>19	Hear thou, my son, and be wise: and guide thy mind in the way.
<br>20	Be not in the feasts of great drinkers, nor in their revellings, who contribute flesh to eat:
<br>21	Because they that give themselves to drink- ing, and that club together, shall be consumed: and drowsiness shall be clothed with rags.
<br>22	Hearken to thy father, that begot thee: and despise not thy mother when she is old.
<br>23	Buy truth, and do not sell wisdom, and instruction, and understanding.
<br>24	The father of the just rejoiceth greatly: he that hath begotten a wise son, shall have joy in him.
<br>25	Let thy father and thy mother be joyful, and let her rejoice that bore thee.
<br>26	My son, give me thy heart: and let thy eyes keep my ways.
<br>27	For a harlot is a deep ditch: and a strange woman is a narrow pit.
<br>28	She lieth in wait in the way as a robber, and him whom she shall see unwary, she will kill. 29 Who hath woe? whose father hath woe? who hath contentions? who falls into pits? who
<br> 
<br>hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes?
<br>30	Surely they that pass their time in wine, and study to drink off their cups.
<br>31	Look not upon the wine when it is yellow, when the colour thereof shineth in the glass: it goeth in pleasantly,
<br>32	But in the end, it will bite like a snake, and will spread abroad poison like a basilisk.
<br>33	Thy eyes shall behold strange women, and thy heart shall utter perverse things.
<br>34	And thou shalt be as one sleeping in the midst of the sea, and as a pilot fast asleep when the stern is lost.
<br>35	And thou shalt say: They have beaten me, but I was not sensible of pain: they drew me, and I felt not: when shall I awake and find wine again?
<br>
<br>Chapter 24
<br>
<br>Seek not to be like evil men, neither desire to be with them:
<br>2	Because their mind studieth robberies, and their lips speak deceits.
<br>3	By wisdom the house shall be built, and by prudence it shall be strengthened.
<br>4	By instruction the storerooms shall be filled with all precious and most beautiful wealth.
<br>5	A wise man is strong: and a knowing man, stout and valiant.
<br>6	Because war is managed by due ordering: and there shall be safety where there are many counsels.
<br>7	Wisdom is too high for a fool; in the gate he shall not open his mouth.
<br>8	He that deviseth to do evils, shall be called a fool.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>9	The thought of a fool is sin: and the detrac- tor is the abomination of men.
<br>10	If thou lose hope, being weary in the day of distress, thy strength shall be diminished.
<br>11	Deliver them that are led to death: and those that are drawn to death, forbear not to deliver.
<br>12	If thou say: I have not strength enough: he that seeth into the heart, he understandeth, and nothing deceiveth the keeper of thy soul, and he shall render to a man according to his works.
<br>13	Eat honey, my son, because it is good, and the honeycomb most sweet to thy throat.
<br>14	So also is the doctrine of wisdom to thy soul: which when thou hast found, thou shalt have hope in the end, and thy hope shall not perish.
<br>15	Lie not in wait, nor seek after wickedness in the house of the just, nor spoil his rest.
<br>16	For a just man shall fall seven times, and shall rise again: but the wicked shall fall down into evil.
<br>17	When thy enemy shall fall, be not glad, and in his ruin let not thy heart rejoice:
<br>18	Lest the Lord see, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him.
<br>19	Contend not with the wicked, nor seek to be like the ungodly.
<br>20	For evil men have no hope of things to come, and the lamp of the wicked shall be put out.
<br>21	My son, fear the Lord, and the king: and have nothing to do with detractors.
<br>22	For their destruction shall rise suddenly: and who knoweth the ruin of both?
<br>23	These things also to the wise: It is not good to have respect to persons in judgment.
<br>24	They that say to the wicked man: Thou art just: shall be cursed by the people, and the tribes shall abhor them.
<br> 
<br>25	They that rebuke him shall be praised: and a blessing shall come upon them.
<br>26	He shall kiss the lips, who answereth right words.
<br>27	Prepare thy work without, and diligently till thy ground: that afterward thou mayst build thy house.
<br>28	Be not witness without cause against thy neighbour: and deceive not any man with thy lips.
<br>29	Say not: I will do to him as he hath done to me: I will render to every one according to his work.
<br>30	I passed by the field of the slothful man, and by the vineyard of the foolish man:
<br>31	And behold it was all filled with nettles, and thorns had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall was broken down.
<br>32	Which when I had seen, I laid it up in my heart, and by the example I received instruction. 33 Thou wilt sleep a little, said I, thou wilt slumber a little, thou wilt fold thy hands a little
<br>to rest.
<br>34 And poverty shall come to thee as a runner, and beggary as an armed man.
<br>
<br>Chapter 25
<br>These are also parables of Solomon, which the men of Ezechias, king of Juda, copied out.
<br>2 It is the glory of God to conceal the word, and the glory of kings to search out the speech. 3 The heaven above and the earth beneath,
<br>and the heart of kings is unsearchable.
<br>4	Take away the rust from silver, and there shall come forth a most pure vessel:
<br>5	Take away wickedness from the face of the king, and his throne shall be established with justice.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>6	Appear not glorious before the king, and stand not in the place of great men.
<br>7	For it is better that it should be said to thee: Come up hither; than that thou shouldst be humbled before the prince.
<br>8	The things which thy eyes have seen, ut- ter not hastily in a quarrel: lest afterward thou mayst not be able to make amends, when thou hast dishonoured thy friend.
<br>9	Treat thy cause with thy friend, and discover not the secret to a stranger:
<br>10	Lest he insult over thee, when he hath heard it, and cease not to upbraid thee. Grace and friendship deliver a man: keep these for thy- self, lest thou fall under reproach.
<br>11	To speak a word in due time, is like apples of gold on beds of silver.
<br>12	As an earring of gold and a bright pearl, so is he that reproveth the wise, and the obedient ear.
<br>13	As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to him that sent him, for he refresheth his soul.
<br>14	As clouds, and wind, when no rain fol- loweth, so is the man that boasteth, and doth not fulfil his promises.
<br>15	By patience a prince shall be appeased, and a soft tongue shall break hardness.
<br>16	Thou hast found honey, eat what is suffi- cient for thee, lest being glutted therewith thou vomit it up.
<br>17	Withdraw thy foot from the house of thy neighbour, lest having his fill he hate thee.
<br>18	A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour, is like a dart and a sword and a sharp arrow.
<br>19	To trust in an unfaithful man in the time of trouble, is like a rotten tooth, and weary foot, 20 And one that looseth his garment in cold weather. As vinegar upon nitre, so is he that
<br> 
<br>singeth songs to a very evil heart. As a moth doth by a garment, and a worm by the wood: so the sadness of a man consumeth the heart.
<br>21	If thy enemy be hungry, give him to eat: if he thirst, give him water to drink:
<br>22	For thou shalt heap hot coals upon his head, and the Lord will reward thee.
<br>23	The north wind driveth away rain, as doth a sad countenance a backbiting tongue.
<br>24	It is better to sit in a corner of the house- top: than with a brawling woman, and in a com- mon house.
<br>25	As cold water to a thirsty soul, so are good tidings from a far country.
<br>26	A just man falling down before the wicked, is as a fountain troubled with the foot and a corrupted spring.
<br>27	As it is not good for a man to eat much honey, so he that is a searcher of majesty shall be overwhelmed by glory.
<br>28	As a city that lieth open and is not com- passed with walls, so is a man that cannot refrain his own spirit in speaking.
<br>
<br>Chapter 26
<br>As snow in summer, and rain in harvest, so glory is not seemly for a fool.
<br>2	As a bird flying to other places, and a spar- row going here or there: so a curse uttered with- out cause shall come upon a man.
<br>3	A whip for a horse, and a snaffle for an ass, and a rod for the back of fools.
<br>4	Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou be made like him.
<br>5	Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he imagine himself to be wise.
<br>6	He that sendeth words by a foolish messen- ger, is lame of feet and drinketh iniquity.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>7	As a lame man hath fair legs in vain: so a parable is unseemly in the mouth of fools.
<br>8	As he that casteth a stone into the heap of Mercury: so is he that giveth honour to a fool.
<br>9	As if a thorn should grow in the hand of a drunkard: so is a parable in the mouth of fools. 10 Judgment determineth causes: and he that
<br>putteth a fool to silence, appeaseth anger.
<br>11	As a dog that returneth to his vomit, so is the fool that repeateth his folly.
<br>12	Hast thou seen a man wise in his own con- ceit? there shall be more hope of a fool than of him.
<br>13	The slothful man saith: There is a lion in the way, and a lioness in the roads.
<br>14	As the door turneth upon its hinges, so doth the slothful upon his bed.
<br>15	The slothful hideth his hand under his armpit, and it grieveth him to turn it to his mouth.
<br>16	The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit, than seven men that speak sentences.
<br>17	As he that taketh a dog by the ears, so is he that passeth by in anger, and meddleth with another man’s quarrel.
<br>18	As he is guilty that shooteth arrows, and lances unto death.
<br>19	So is the man that hurteth his friend de- ceitfully: and when he is taken, saith: I did it in jest.
<br>20	When the wood faileth, the fire shall go out: and when the talebearer is taken away, con- tentions shall cease.
<br>21	As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire, so an angry man stirreth up strife.
<br>22	The words of a talebearer are as it were simple, but they reach to the innermost parts of the belly.
<br>23	Swelling lips joined with a corrupt heart, are like an earthern vessel adorned with silver
<br> 
<br>dross.
<br>24	An enemy is known by his lips, when in his heart he entertaineth deceit.
<br>25	When he shall speak low, trust him not: because there are seven mischiefs in his heart.
<br>26	He that covereth hatred deceitfully, his malice shall be laid open in the public assembly. 27 He that diggeth a pit, shall fall into it: and
<br>he that rolleth a stone, it shall return to him.
<br>28 A deceitful tongue loveth not truth: and a slippery mouth worketh ruin.
<br>
<br>Chapter 27
<br>
<br>Boast not for to morrow, for thou knowest not what the day to come may bring forth.
<br>2	Let another praise thee, and not thy own mouth: a stranger, and not thy own lips.
<br>3	A stone is heavy, and sand weighty: but the anger of a fool is heavier than them both.
<br>4	Anger hath no mercy: nor fury, when it breaketh forth: and who can bear the violence of one provoked?
<br>5	Open rebuke is better than hidden love.
<br>6	Better are the wounds of a friend, than the deceitful kisses of an enemy.
<br>7	A soul that is full shall tread upon the hon- eycomb: and a soul that is hungry shall take even bitter for sweet.
<br>8	As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that leaveth his place.
<br>9	Ointment and perfumes rejoice the heart: and the good counsels of a friend are sweet to the soul.
<br>10	Thy own friend, and thy father’s friend, forsake not: and go not into thy brother’s house in the day of thy affliction. Better is a neighbour that is near than a brother afar off.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>11	Study wisdom, my son, and make my heart joyful, that thou mayst give an answer to him that reproacheth.
<br>12	The prudent man seeing evil hideth him- self: little ones passing on have suffered losses.
<br>13	Take away his garment that hath been surety for a stranger: and take from him a pledge for strangers.
<br>14	He that blesseth his neighbour with a loud voice, rising in the night, shall be like to him that curseth.
<br>15	Roofs dropping through in a cold day, and a contentious woman are alike.
<br>16	He that retaineth her, is as he that would hold the wind, and shall call the oil of his right hand.
<br>17	Iron sharpeneth iron, so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.
<br>18	He that keepeth the fig tree, shall eat the fruit thereof: and he that is the keeper of his master, shall be glorified.
<br>19	As the faces of them that look therein, shine in the water, so the hearts of men are laid open to the wise.
<br>20	Hell and destruction are never filled: so the eyes of men are never satisfied.
<br>21	As silver is tried in the fining-pot, and gold in the furnace: so a man is tried by the mouth of him that praiseth. The heart of the wicked seeketh after evils, but the righteous heart seeketh after knowledge.
<br>22	Though thou shouldst bray a fool in the mortar, as when a pestle striketh upon sodden barley, his folly would not be taken from him.
<br>23	Be diligent to know the countenance of thy cattle, and consider thy own flocks:
<br>24	For thou shalt not always have power: but a crown shall be given to generation and gener- ation.
<br> 
<br>25	The meadows are open, and the green herbs have appeared, and the hay is gathered out of the mountains.
<br>26	Lambs are for thy clothing: and kids for the price of the field.
<br>27	Let the milk of the goats be enough for thy food, and for the necessities of thy house, and for maintenance for thy handmaids.
<br>
<br>Chapter 28
<br>The wicked man fleeth, when no man pursueth: but the just, bold as a lion, shall be without dread.
<br>2	For the sins of the land many are the princes thereof: and for the wisdom of a man, and the knowledge of those things that are said, the life of the prince shall be prolonged.
<br>3	A poor man that oppresseth the poor, is like a violent shower, which bringeth a famine.
<br>4	They that forsake the law, praise the wicked man: they that keep it, are incensed against him. 5 Evil men think not on judgment: but they that seek after the Lord, take notice of all things. 6 Better is the poor man walking in his sim-
<br>plicity, than the rich in crooked ways.
<br>7	He that keepeth the law, is a wise son: but he that feedeth gluttons, shameth his father.
<br>8	He that heapeth together riches by usury and loan, gathereth them for him that will be bountiful to the poor.
<br>9	He that turneth away his ears from hearing the law, his prayer shall be an abomination.
<br>10	He that deceiveth the just in a wicked way, shall fall in his own destruction: and the upright shall possess his goods.
<br>11	The rich man seemeth to himself wise: but the poor man that is prudent shall search him out.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>12	In the joy of the just there is great glory: when the wicked reign, men are ruined.
<br>13	He that hideth his sins, shall not prosper: but he that shall confess, and forsake them, shall obtain mercy.
<br>14	Blessed is the man that is always fearful: but he that is hardened in mind shall fall into evil.
<br>15	As a roaring lion, and a hungry bear, so is a wicked prince over the poor people.
<br>16	A prince void of prudence shall oppress many by calumny: but he that hateth covetous- ness, shall prolong his days.
<br>17	A man that doth violence to the blood of a person, if he flee even to the pit, no man will stay him.
<br>18	He that walketh uprightly, shall be saved: he that is perverse in his ways, shall fall at once. 19 He that tilleth his ground, shall be filled with bread: but he that followeth idleness, shall
<br>be filled with poverty.
<br>20	A faithful man shall be much praised: but he that maketh haste to be rich, shall not be innocent.
<br>21	He that hath respect to a person in judg- ment, doth not well: such a man even for a morsel of bread forsaketh the truth.
<br>22	A man that maketh haste to be rich, and envieth others, is ignorant that poverty shall come upon him.
<br>23	He that rebuketh a man, shall afterward find favour with him, more than he that by a flattering tongue deceiveth him.
<br>24	He that stealeth any thing from his father, or from his mother: and saith, This is no sin, is the partner of a murderer.
<br>26 He that boasteth and puffeth up himself, stirreth up quarrels: but he that trusteth in the Lord, shall be healed.
<br> 
<br>26	He that trusteth in his own heart, is a fool: but he that walketh wisely, he shall be saved.
<br>27	He that giveth to the poor shall not want: he that despiseth his intreaty, shall suffer indi- gence.
<br>28	When the wicked rise up, men shall hide themselves: when they perish, the just shall be multiplied.
<br>
<br>Chapter 29
<br>The man that with a stiff neck despiseth him that reproveth him, shall suddenly be destroyed: and health shall not follow him.
<br>2	When just men increase, the people shall re- joice: when the wicked shall bear rule, the people shall mourn.
<br>3	A man that loveth wisdom, rejoiceth his father: but he that maintaineth harlots, shall squander away his substance.
<br>4	A just king setteth up the land: a covetous man shall destroy it.
<br>5	A man that speaketh to his friend with flat- tering and dissembling words, spreadeth a net for his feet.
<br>6	A snare shall entangle the wicked man when he sinneth: and the just shall praise and rejoice. 7 The just taketh notice of the cause of the
<br>poor: the wicked is void of knowledge.
<br>8	Corrupt men bring a city to ruin: but wise men turn away wrath.
<br>9	If a wise man contend with a fool, whether he be angry, or laugh, he shall find no rest.
<br>10	Bloodthirsty men hate the upright: but just men seek his soul.
<br>11	A fool uttereth all his mind: a wise man deferreth, and keepeth it till afterwards.
<br>12	A prince that gladly heareth lying words, hath all his servants wicked.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>13	The poor man and the creditor have met one another: the Lord is the enlightener of them both.
<br>14	The king that judgeth the poor in truth, his throne shall be established for ever.
<br>15	The rod and reproof give wisdom: but the child that is left to his own will, bringeth his mother to shame.
<br>16	When the wicked are multiplied, crimes shall be multiplied: but the just shall see their downfall.
<br>17	Instruct thy son and he shall refresh thee, and shall give delight to thy soul.
<br>18	When prophecy shall fail, the people shall be scattered abroad: but he that keepeth the law, is blessed.
<br>19	A slave will not be corrected by words: be- cause he understandeth what thou sayest, and will not answer.
<br>20	Hast thou seen a man hasty to speak? folly is rather to be looked for, than his amendment. 21 He that nourisheth his servant delicately from his childhood, afterwards shall find him
<br>stubborn.
<br>22	A passionate man provoketh quarrels: and he that is easily stirred up to wrath, shall be more prone to sin.
<br>23	Humiliation followeth the proud: and glory shall uphold the humble of spirit.
<br>24	He that is partaker with a thief, hateth his own soul: he heareth one putting him to his oath, and discovereth not.
<br>25	He that feareth man shall quickly fall: he that trusteth in the Lord, shall be set on high.
<br>26	Many seek the face of the prince: but the judgment of every one cometh forth from the Lord.
<br>27	The just abhor a wicked man: and the wicked loathe them that are in the right way.
<br> 
<br>The son that keepeth the word, shall be free from destruction.
<br>
<br>Chapter 30
<br>
<br>The words of Gatherer the son of Vomiter. The vision which the man spoke, with whom God is, and who being strengthened by God, abiding with him, said:
<br>2	I am the most foolish of men, and the wis- dom of men is not with me.
<br>3	I have not learned wisdom, and have not known the science of saints.
<br>4	Who hath ascended up into heaven, and de- scended? who hath held the wind in his hands? who hath bound up the waters together as in a garment? who hath raised up all the borders of the earth? what is his name, and what is the name of his son, if thou knowest?
<br>5	Every word of God is fire tried: he is a buck- ler to them that hope in him.
<br>6	Add not any thing to his words, lest thou be reproved and found a liar:
<br>7	Two things I have asked of thee, deny them not to me before I die.
<br>8	Remove far from me vanity, and lying words. Give me neither beggary, nor riches: give me only the necessaries of life:
<br>9	Lest perhaps being filled, I should be tempted to deny, and say: Who is the Lord? or being compelled by poverty, I should steal, and forswear the name of my God.
<br>10	Accuse not a servant to his master, lest he curse thee, and thou fall.
<br>11	There is a generation that curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother.
<br>12	A generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet are not washed from their filthiness.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>13	A generation, whose eyes are lofty, and their eyelids lifted up on high.
<br>14	A generation that for teeth hath swords, and grindeth with their jaw teeth, to devour the needy from off the earth, and the poor from among men.
<br>15	The horseleech hath two daughters that say: Bring, bring. There are three things that never are satisfied, and the fourth never saith: It is enough.
<br>16	Hell and the mouth of the womb, and the earth which is not satisfied with water: and the fire never saith: It is enough.
<br>17	The eye that mocketh at his father, and that despiseth the labour of his mother in bear- ing him, let the ravens of the brooks pick it out, and the young eagles eat it.
<br>18	Three things are hard to me, and the fourth I am utterly ignorant of.
<br>19	The way of an eagle in the air, the way of a serpent upon a rock, the way of a ship in the midst of the sea, and the way of a man in youth.
<br>20	Such also is the way of an adulterous woman, who eateth and wipeth her mouth, and saith: I have done no evil.
<br>21	By three things the earth is disturbed, and the fourth it cannot bear.
<br>22	By a slave when he reigneth: by a fool when be is filled with meat:
<br>23	By an odious woman when she is married: and by a bondwoman when she is heir to her mistress.
<br>24	There are four very little things of the earth, and they are wiser than the wise.
<br>25	The ants, a feeble people, which provide themselves food in the harvest:
<br>26	The rabbit, a weak people, which maketh its bed in the rock:
<br>27	The locust hath no king, yet they all go out by their bands:
<br> 
<br>28	The stellio supporteth itself on hands, and dwelleth in kings’ houses.
<br>19 There are three things, which go well, and the fourth that walketh happily:
<br>30	A lion, the strongest of beasts, who hath no fear of any thing he meeteth:
<br>31	A cock girded about the loins: and a ram: and a king, whom none can resist.
<br>32	There is that hath appeared a fool after he was lifted up on high: for if he had understood, he would have laid his hand upon his mouth.
<br>33	And he that strongly squeezeth the paps to bring out milk, straineth out butter:   and he that violently bloweth his nose, bringeth out blood: and he that provoketh wrath, bringeth forth strife.
<br>
<br>Chapter 31
<br>
<br>The words of king Lamuel. The vision wherewith his mother instructed him.
<br>2	What, O my beloved, what, O the beloved of my womb, what, O the beloved of my vows?
<br>3	Give not thy substance to women, and thy riches to destroy kings.
<br>4	Give not to kings, O Lamuel, give not wine to kings: because there is no secret where drunk- enness reigneth:
<br>5	And lest they drink and forget judgments, and pervert the cause of the children of the poor. 6 Give strong drink to them that are sad; and
<br>wine to them that are grieved in mind:
<br>7	Let them drink, and forget their want, and remember their sorrow no more.
<br>8	Open thy mouth for the dumb, and for the causes of all the children that pass.
<br>9	Open thy mouth, decree that which is just, and do justice to the needy and poor.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>10	Who shall find a valiant woman? far, and from the uttermost coasts is the price of her.
<br>11	The heart of her husband trusteth in her, and he shall have no need of spoils.
<br>12	She will render him good, and not evil all the days of her life.
<br>13	She hath sought wool and flax, and hath wrought by the counsel of her hands.
<br>14	She is like the merchant’s ship, she bringeth her bread from afar.
<br>15	And she hath risen in the night, and given a prey to her household, and victuals to her maid- ens.
<br>16	She hath considered a field, and bought it: with the fruit of her hands she hath planted a vineyard.
<br>17	She hath girded her loins with strength, and hath strengthened her arm.
<br>18	She hath tasted, and seen that her traffic is good: her lamp shall not be put out in the night. 19 She hath put out her hand to strong things,
<br>and her fingers have taken hold of the spindle.
<br>20	She hath opened her hand to the needy, and stretched out her hands to the poor.
<br>21	She shall not fear for her house in the cold of snow: for all her domestics are clothed with double garments.
<br>22	She hath made for herself clothing of tapestry: fine linen, and purple, is her covering. 23 Her husband is honourable in the gates, when he sitteth among the senators of the land. 24 She made fine linen, and sold it, and deliv-
<br>ered a girdle to the Chanaanite.
<br>25	Strength and beauty are her clothing, and she shall laugh in the latter day.
<br>26	She hath opened her mouth to wisdom, and the law of clemency is on her tongue.
<br>27	She hath looked well on the paths of her house, and hath not eaten her bread idle.
<br> 
<br>28	Her children rose up, and called her blessed: her husband, and he praised her.
<br>29	Many daughters have gathered together riches: thou hast surpassed them all.
<br>30	Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: the woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised.
<br>31	Give her of the fruit of her hands: and let her works praise her in the gates.

<br>Ecclesiastes
<br>
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>The words of Ecclesiastes, the son of David, king of Jerusalem.
<br>2	Vanity of vanities, said Ecclesiastes: vanity of vanities, and all is vanity.
<br>3	What hath a man more of all his labour, that he taketh under the sun?
<br>4	One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth standeth for ever.
<br>5	The sun riseth, and goeth down, and retur- neth to his place: and there rising again,
<br>6	Maketh his round by the south, and turneth again to the north: the spirit goeth forward sur- veying all places round about, and returneth to his circuits.
<br>7	All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea doth not overflow: unto the place from whence the rivers come, they return, to flow again.
<br>8	All things are hard: man cannot explain them by word. The eye is not filled with see- ing, neither is the ear filled with hearing.
<br>9	What is it that hath been? the same thing that shall be. What is it that hath been done? the same that shall be done.
<br>10	Nothing under the sun is new, neither is any man able to say: Behold this is new: for it hath already gone before in the ages that were before us.
<br>11	There is no remembrance of former things: nor indeed of those things which hereafter are
<br> 
<br>
<br>to come, shall there be any remembrance with them that shall be in the latter end.
<br>12	I Ecclesiastes was king over Israel in Jerusalem,
<br>13	And I proposed in my mind to seek and search out wisely concerning all things that are done under the sun. This painful occupation hath God given to the children of men, to be exercised therein.
<br>14	I have seen all things that are done under the sun, and behold all is vanity, and vexation of spirit.
<br>15	The perverse are hard to be corrected, and the number of fools is infinite.
<br>16	I have spoken in my heart, saying: Behold I am become great, and have gone beyond all in wisdom, that were before me in Jerusalem: and my mind hath contemplated many things wisely, and I have learned.
<br>17	And I have given my heart to know pru- dence, and learning, and errors, and folly: and I have perceived that in these also there was labour, and vexation of spirit,
<br>18	Because in much wisdom there is much in- dignation: and he that addeth knowledge, ad- deth also labour.
<br>
<br>Chapter 2
<br>I said in my heart: I will go, and abound with delights, and enjoy good things. And I saw that
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>this also was vanity.
<br>2	Laughter I counted error: and to mirth I said: Why art thou vainly deceived?
<br>3	I thought in my heart, to withdraw my flesh from wine, that I might turn my mind to wisdom, and might avoid folly, till I might see what was profitable for the children of men: and what they ought to do under the sun, all the days of their life.
<br>4	I made me great works, I built me houses, and planted vineyards,
<br>5	I made gardens, and orchards, and set them with trees of all kinds,
<br>6	And I made me ponds of water, to water therewith the wood of the young trees,
<br>7	I got me menservants, and maidservants, and had a great family: and herds of oxen, and great flocks of sheep, above all that were before me in Jerusalem:
<br>8	I heaped together for myself silver and gold, and the wealth of kings, and provinces: I made me singing men, and singing women, and the delights of the sons of men, cups and vessels to serve to pour out wine:
<br>9	And I surpassed in riches all that were before me in Jerusalem: my wisdom also remained with me.
<br>10	And whatsoever my eyes desired, I refused them not: and I withheld not my heart from enjoying every pleasure, and delighting itself in the things which I had prepared: and esteemed this my portion, to make use of my own labour. 11 And when I turned myself to all the works which my hands had wrought, and to the labours wherein I had laboured in vain, I saw in all things vanity, and vexation of mind, and that nothing
<br>was lasting under the sun.
<br>12 I passed further to behold wisdom, and er- rors and folly, (What is man, said I that he can follow the King his maker?)
<br> 
<br>13	And I saw that wisdom excelled folly, as much as light differeth from darkness.
<br>14	The eyes of a wise man are in his head: the fool walketh in darkness: and I learned that they were to die both alike.
<br>15	And I said in my heart: If the death of the fool and mine shall be one, what doth it avail me, that I have applied myself more to the study of wisdom? And speaking with my own mind, I perceived that this also was vanity.
<br>16	For there shall be no remembrance of the wise no more than of the fool forever, and the times to come shall cover all things together with oblivion: the learned dieth in like manner as the unlearned.
<br>17	And therefore I was weary of my life, when I saw that all things under the sun are evil, and all vanity and vexation of spirit.
<br>18	Again I hated all my application wherewith I had earnestly laboured under the sun, being like to have an heir after me,
<br>19	Whom I know not whether he will be a wise man or a fool, and he shall have rule over all my labours with which I have laboured and been solicitous: and is there anything so vain?
<br>20	Wherefore I left off and my heart re- nounced labouring anymore under the sun.
<br>21	For when a man laboureth in wisdom, and knowledge, and carefulness, he leaveth what he hath gotten to an idle man: so this also is vanity, and a great evil.
<br>22	For what profit shall a man have of all his labour, and vexation of spirit, with which he hath been tormented under the sun?
<br>23	All his days are full of sorrows and miseries, even in the night he doth not rest in mind: and is not this vanity?
<br>24	Is it not better to eat and drink, and to shew his soul good things of his labours? and this is from the hand of God.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>25	Who shall so feast and abound with de- lights as I?
<br>26	God hath given to a man that is good in his sight, wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he hath given vexation, and super- fluous care, to heap up and to gather together, and to give it to him that hath pleased God: but this also is vanity, and a fruitless solicitude of the mind.
<br>
<br>Chapter 3
<br>All things have their season, and in their times all things pass under heaven.
<br>2	A time to be born and a time to die. A time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted.
<br>3	A time to kill, and a time to heal. A time to destroy, and a time to build.
<br>4	A time to weep, and a time to laugh. A time to mourn, and a time to dance.
<br>5	A time to scatter stones, and a time to gather. A time to embrace, and a time to be far from embraces.
<br>6	A time to get, and a time to lose. A time to keep, and a time to cast away.
<br>7	A time to rend, and a time to sew. A time to keep silence, and a time to speak.
<br>8	A time of love, and a time of hatred. A time of war, and a time of peace.
<br>9	What hath man more of his labour?
<br>10	I have seen the trouble, which God hath given the sons of men to be exercised in it.
<br>11	He hath made all things good in their time, and hath delivered the world to their considera- tion, so that man cannot find out the work which God hath made from the beginning to the end.
<br>12	And I have known that there was no better thing than to rejoice, and to do well in this life.
<br> 
<br>13	For every man that eateth and drinketh, and seeth good of his labour, this is the gift of God.
<br>14	I have learned that all the works which God hath made, continue for ever: we cannot add any thing, nor take away from those things which God hath made that he may be feared.
<br>15	That which hath been made, the same con- tinueth: the things that shall be, have already been: and God restoreth that which is past.
<br>16	I saw under the sun in the place of judg- ment wickedness, and in the place of justice in- iquity.
<br>17	And I said in my heart: God shall judge both the just and the wicked, and then shall be the time of every thing.
<br>18	I said in my heart concerning the sons of men, that God would prove them, and shew them to be like beasts.
<br>19	Therefore the death of man, and of beasts is one, and the condition of them both is equal: as man dieth, so they also die: all things breathe alike, and man hath nothing more than beast: all things are subject to vanity.
<br>20	And all things go to one place: of earth they were made, and into earth they return to- gether.
<br>21	Who knoweth if the spirit of the children of Adam ascend upward, and if the spirit of the beasts descend downward?
<br>22	And I have found that nothing is better than for a man to rejoice in his work, and that this is his portion. For who shall bring him to know the things that shall be after him?
<br>
<br>Chapter 4
<br>I turned myself to other things, and I saw the oppressions that are done under the sun, and the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>tears of the innocent, and they had no comforter; and they were not able to resist their violence, being destitute of help from any.
<br>2	And I praised the dead rather than the liv- ing:
<br>3	And I judged him happier than them both, that is not yet born, nor hath seen the evils that are done under the sun.
<br>4	Again I considered all the labours of men, and I remarked that their industries are exposed to the envy of their neighbour: so in this also there is vanity, and fruitless care.
<br>5	The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh, saying:
<br>6	Better is a handful with rest, than both hands full with labour, and vexation of mind.
<br>7	Considering I found also another vanity un- der the sun:
<br>8	There is but one, and he hath not a second, no child, no brother, and yet he ceaseth not to labour, neither are his eyes satisfied with riches, neither doth he reflect, saying: For whom do I labour, and defraud my soul of good things? in this also is vanity, and a grievous vexation.
<br>9	It is better therefore that two should be to- gether, than one: for they have the advantage of their society:
<br>10	If one fall he shall be supported by the other: woe to him that is alone, for when he falleth, he hath none to lift him up.
<br>11	And if two lie together, they shall warm one another: how shall one alone be warmed?
<br>12	And if a man prevail against one, two shall withstand him: a threefold cord is not easily bro- ken.
<br>13	Better is a child that is poor and wise, than a king that is old and foolish, who knoweth not to foresee for hereafter.
<br>14	Because out of prison and chains sometimes a man cometh forth to a kingdom: and another
<br> 
<br>born king is consumed with poverty.
<br>15	I saw all men living, that walk under the sun with the second young man, who shall rise up in his place.
<br>16	The number of the people, of all that were before him is infinite: and they that shall come afterwards, shall not rejoice in him: but this also is vanity, and vexation of spirit.
<br>17	Keep thy foot, when thou goest into the house of God, and draw nigh to hear. For much better is obedience, than the victims of fools, who know not what evil they do.
<br>
<br>Chapter 5
<br>Speak not any thing rashly, and let not thy heart be hasty to utter a word before God. For God is in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.
<br>2	Dreams follow many cares: and in many words shall be found folly.
<br>3	If thou hast vowed any thing to God, de- fer not to pay it: for an unfaithful and foolish promise displeaseth him: but whatsoever thou hast vowed, pay it.
<br>4	And it is much better not to vow, than after a vow not to perform the things promised.
<br>5	Give not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin: and say not before the angel: There is no providence: lest God be angry at thy words, and destroy all the works of thy hands.
<br>6	Where there are many dreams, there are many vanities, and words without number: but do thou fear God.
<br>7	If thou shalt see the oppressions of the poor, and violent judgments, and justice perverted in the province, wonder not at this matter: for he that is high hath another higher, and there are others still higher than these:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>8	Moreover there is the king that reigneth over all the land subject to him.
<br>9	A covetous man shall not be satisfied with money: and he that loveth riches shall reap no fruit from them: so this also is vanity.
<br>10	Where there are great riches, there are also many to eat them. And what doth it profit the owner, but that he seeth the riches with his eyes?
<br>11	Sleep is sweet to a labouring man, whether he eat little or much: but the fulness of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.
<br>12	There is also another grievous evil, which I have seen under the sun: riches kept to the hurt of the owner.
<br>13	For they are lost with very great affliction: he hath begotten a son, who shall be in extremity of want.
<br>14	As he came forth naked from his mother’s womb, so shall he return, and shall take nothing away with him of his labour.
<br>15	A most deplorable evil: as he came, so shall he return. What then doth it profit him that he hath laboured for the wind?
<br>16	All the days of his life he eateth in darkness, and in many cares, and in misery, and sorrow.
<br>17	This therefore hath seemed good to me, that a man should eat and drink, and enjoy the fruit of his labour, wherewith he hath laboured under the sun, all the days of his life, which God hath given him: and this is his portion.
<br>18	And every man to whom God hath given riches, and substance, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to enjoy his portion, and to rejoice of his labour: this is the gift of God.
<br>19	For he shall not much remember the days of his life, because God entertaineth his heart with delight.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 6
<br>
<br>There is also another evil, which I have seen un- der the sun, and that frequent among men:
<br>2	A man to whom God hath given riches, and substance, and honour, and his soul wan- teth nothing of all that he desireth: yet God doth not give him power to eat thereof, but a stranger shall eat it up. This is vanity and a great misery.
<br>3	If a man beget a hundred children, and live many years, and attain to a great age, and his soul make no use of the goods of his substance, and he be without burial: of this man I pro- nounce, that the untimely born is better than he.
<br>4	For he came in vain, and goeth to darkness, and his name shall be wholly forgotten.
<br>5	He hath not seen the sun, nor known the distance of good and evil:
<br>6	Although he lived two thousand years, and hath not enjoyed good things: do not all make haste to one place?
<br>7	All the labour of man is for his mouth, but his soul shall not be filled.
<br>8	What hath the wise man more than the fool? and what the poor man, but to go thither, where there is life?
<br>9	Better it is to see what thou mayst desire, than to desire that which thou canst not know. But this also is vanity, and presumption of spirit.
<br>10	He that shall be, his name is already called: and it is known, that he is a man, and cannot contend in judgment with him that is stronger than himself.
<br>11	There are many words that have much van- ity in disputing.
<br>

<br> 
<br>Chapter 7
<br>What needeth a man to seek things that are above him, whereas he knoweth not what is profitable for him in his life, in all the days of his pilgrimage, and the time that passeth like a shadow? Or who can tell him what shall be after him under the sun?
<br>2	A good name is better than precious oint- ments: and the day of death than the day of one’s birth.
<br>3	It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to the house of feasting: for in that we are put in mind of the end of all, and the living thinketh what is to come.
<br>4	Anger is better than laughter: because by the sadness of the countenance the mind of the offender is corrected.
<br>5	The heart of the wise is where there is mourning, and the heart of fools where there is mirth.
<br>6	It is better to be rebuked by a wise man, than to be deceived by the flattery of fools.
<br>7	For as the crackling of thorns burning under a pot, so is the laughter of a fool: now this also is vanity.
<br>8	Oppression troubleth the wise, and shall de- stroy the strength of his heart.
<br>9	Better is the end of a speech than the be- ginning. Better is the patient man than the pre- sumptuous.
<br>10	Be not quickly angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of a fool.
<br>11	Say not: What thinkest thou is the cause that former times were better than they are now? for this manner of question is foolish.
<br>12	Wisdom with riches is more profitable, and bringeth more advantage to them that see the sun.
<br>13	For as wisdom is a defence, so money is a
<br> 
<br>defence: but learning and wisdom excel in this, that they give life to him that possesseth them. 14 Consider the works of God, that no man
<br>can correct whom he hath despised.
<br>15	In the good day enjoy good things, and beware beforehand of the evil day: for God hath made both the one and the other, that man may not find against him any just complaint.
<br>16	These things also I saw in the days of my vanity: A just man perisheth in his justice, and a wicked man liveth a long time in his wickedness. 17 Be not over just: and be not more wise
<br>than is necessary, lest thou become stupid.
<br>18	Be not overmuch wicked: and be not fool- ish, lest thou die before thy time.
<br>19	It is good that thou shouldst hold up the just, yea and from him withdraw not thy hand: for he that feareth God, neglecteth nothing.
<br>20	Wisdom hath strengthened the wise more than ten princes of the city.
<br>21	For there is no just man upon earth, that doth good, and sinneth not.
<br>22	But do not apply thy heart to all words that are spoken: lest perhaps thou hear thy ser- vant reviling thee.
<br>23	For thy conscience knoweth that thou also hast often spoken evil of others.
<br>24	I have tried all things in wisdom. I have said: I will be wise: and it departed farther from me,
<br>25	Much more than it was: it is a great depth, who shall find it out?
<br>26	I have surveyed all things with my mind, to know, and consider, and seek out wisdom and reason: and to know the wickedness of the fool, and the error of the imprudent:
<br>27	And I have found a woman more bitter than death, who is the hunter’s snare, and her heart is a net, and her hands are bands. He that
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>pleaseth God shall escape from her: but he that is a sinner, shall be caught by her.
<br>28	Lo this have I found, said Ecclesiastes, weighing one thing after another, that I might find out the account,
<br>29	Which yet my soul seeketh, and I have not found it. One man among a thousand I have found, a woman among them all I have not found.
<br>30	Only this I have found, that God made man right, and he hath entangled himself with an infinity of questions. Who is as the wise man? and who hath known the resolution of the word?
<br>
<br>Chapter 8
<br>The wisdom of a man shineth in his countenance, and the most mighty will change his face.
<br>2	I observe the mouth of the king, and the commandments of the oath of God.
<br>3	Be not hasty to depart from his face, and do not continue in an evil work: for he will do all that pleaseth him:
<br>4	And his word is full of power: neither can any man say to him: Why dost thou so?
<br>5	He that keepeth the commandment, shall find no evil. The heart of a wiser man under- standeth time and answer.
<br>6	There is a time and opportunity for every business, and great affliction for man:
<br>7	Because he is ignorant of things past, and things to come he cannot know by any messen- ger.
<br>8	It is not in man’s power to stop the spirit, neither hath he power in the day of death, nei- ther is he suffered to rest when war is at hand, neither shall wickedness save the wicked.
<br>9	All these things I have considered, and ap- plied my heart to all the works that are done
<br> 
<br>under the sun. Sometimes one man ruleth over another to his own hurt.
<br>10	I saw the wicked buried: who also when they were yet living were in the holy place, and were praised in the city as men of just works: but this also is vanity.
<br>11	For because sentence is not speedily pro- nounced against the evil, the children of men commit evils without any fear.
<br>12	But though a sinner do evil a hundred times, and by patience be borne withal, I know from thence that it shall be well with them that fear God, who dread his face.
<br>13	But let it not be well with the wicked, nei- ther let his days be prolonged, but as a shadow let them pass away that fear not the face of the Lord.
<br>14	There is also another vanity, which is done upon the earth. There are just men to whom evils happen, as though they had done the works of the wicked: and there are wicked men, who are as secure as though they had the deeds of the just: but this also I judge most vain.
<br>15	Therefore I commended mirth, because there was no good for a man under the sun, but to eat, and drink, and be merry, and that he should take nothing else with him of his labour in the days of his life, which God hath given him under the sun.
<br>16	And I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to understand the distraction that is upon earth: for there are some that day and night take no sleep with their eyes.
<br>17	And I understood that man can find no reason of all those works of God that are done under the sun: and the more he shall labour to seek, so much the less shall he find: yea, though the wise man shall say, that he knoweth it, he shall not be able to find it.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 9
<br>All these things have I considered in my heart, that I might carefully understand them: there are just men and wise men, and their works are in the hand of God: and yet man knoweth not whether he be worthy of love, or hatred:
<br>2 But all things are kept uncertain for the time to come, because all things equally happen to the just and to the wicked, to the good and to the evil, to the clean and to the unclean, to him that offereth victims, and to him that despiseth sacrifices. As the good is, so also is the sinner: as the perjured, so he also that sweareth truth. 3 This is a very great evil among all things that are done under the sun, that the same things happen to all men:	whereby also the hearts of the children of men are filled with evil, and with contempt while they live, and after-
<br>wards they shall be brought down to hell.
<br>4	There is no man that liveth always, or that hopeth for this: a living dog is better than a dead lion.
<br>5	For the living know that they shall die, but the dead know nothing more, neither have they a reward any more: for the memory of them is forgotten.
<br>6	Their love also, and their hatred, and their envy are all perished, neither have they any part in this world, and in the work that is done under the sun.
<br>7	Go then, and eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with gladness: because thy works please God.
<br>8	At all times let thy garments be white, and let not oil depart from thy head.
<br>9	Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest, all the days of thy unsteady life, which are given to thee under the sun, all the time of thy vanity: for this is thy portion in life, and in thy labour
<br> 
<br>wherewith thou labourest under the sun.
<br>10	Whatsoever thy hand is able to do,   do it earnestly: for neither work, nor reason, nor wisdom, nor knowledge shall be in hell, whither thou art hastening.
<br>11	I turned me to another thing, and I saw that under the sun, the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, nor bread to the wise, nor riches to the learned, nor favour to the skilful: but time and chance in all.
<br>12	Man knoweth not his own end: but as fishes are taken with the hook, and as birds are caught with the snare, so men are taken in the evil time, when it shall suddenly come upon them.
<br>13	This wisdom also I have seen under the sun, and it seemed to me to be very great:
<br>14	A little city, and few men in it: there came against it a great king, and invested it, and built bulwarks round about it, and the siege was per- fect.
<br>15	Now there was found in it a man poor and wise, and he delivered the city by his wisdom, and no man afterward remembered that poor man.
<br>16	And I said that wisdom is better than strength: how then is the wisdom of the poor man slighted, and his words not heard?
<br>17	The words of the wise are heard in silence, more than the cry of a prince among fools.
<br>18	Better is wisdom, than weapons of war: and he that shall offend in one, shall lose many good things.
<br>
<br>Chapter 10
<br>
<br>Dying flies spoil the sweetness of the ointment. Wisdom and glory is more precious than a small and shortlived folly.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>2	The heart of a wise man is in his right hand, and the heart of a fool is in his left hand.
<br>3	Yea, and the fool when he walketh in the way, whereas he himself is a fool, esteemeth all men fools.
<br>4	If the spirit of him that hath power, ascend upon thee, leave not thy place: because care will make the greatest sins to cease.
<br>5	There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, as it were by an error proceeding from the face of the prince:
<br>6	A fool set in high dignity, and the rich sitting beneath.
<br>7	I have seen servants upon horses: and princes walking on the ground as servants.
<br>8	He that diggeth a pit, shall fall into it: and he that breaketh a hedge, a serpent shall bite him.
<br>9	He that removeth stones, shall be hurt by them: and he that cutteth trees, shall be wounded by them.
<br>10	If the iron be blunt, and be not as before, but be made blunt, with much labour it shall be sharpened: and after industry shall follow wis- dom.
<br>11	If a serpent bite in silence, he is nothing better that backbiteth secretly.
<br>12	The words of the mouth of a wise man are grace: but the lips of a fool shall throw him down headlong.
<br>13	The beginning of his words is folly, and the end of his talk is a mischievous error.
<br>14	A fool multiplieth words. A man cannot tell what hath been before him: and what shall be after him, who can tell him?
<br>15	The labour of fools shall afflict them that know not how to go to the city.
<br>16	Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and when the princes eat in the morning.
<br> 
<br>17	Blessed is the land, whose king is noble, and whose princes eat in due season for refresh- ment, and not for riotousness.
<br>18	By slothfulness a building shall be brought down, and through the weakness of hands, the house shall drop through.
<br>19	For laughter they make bread, and wine that the living may feast: and all things obey money.
<br>20	Detract not the king, no not in thy thought; and speak not evil of the rich man in thy private chamber: because even the birds of the air will carry thy voice, and he that hath wings will tell what thou hast said.
<br>
<br>Chapter 11
<br>
<br>Cast thy bread upon the running waters: for af- ter a long time thou shalt find it again.
<br>2	Give a portion to seven, and also to eight: for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth.
<br>3	If the clouds be full, they will pour out rain upon the earth. If the tree fall to the south, or to the north, in what place soever it shall fall, there shall it be.
<br>4	He that observeth the wind, shall not sow: and he that considereth the clouds, shall never reap.
<br>5	As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit, nor how the bones are joined together in the womb of her that is with child: so thou know- est not the works of God, who is the maker of all.
<br>6	In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening let not thy hand cease: for thou knowest not which may rather spring up, this or that: and if both together, it shall be the better.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>7	The light is sweet, and it is delightful for the eyes to see the sun.
<br>8	If a man live many years, and have rejoiced in them all, he must remember the darksome time, and the many days: which when they shall come, the things past shall be accused of vanity.
<br>9	Rejoice therefore, O young man, in thy youth, and let thy heart be in that which is good in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the sight of thy eyes: and know that for all these God will bring thee into judgment.
<br>10	Remove anger from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh. For youth and plea- sure are vain.
<br>
<br>Chapter 12
<br>Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth, before the time of affliction come, and the years draw nigh of which thou shalt say: They please me not:
<br>2	Before the sun, and the light, and the moon, and the stars be darkened, and the clouds return after the rain:
<br>3	When the keepers of the house shall trem- ble, and the strong men shall stagger, and the grinders shall be idle in a small number, and they that look through the holes shall be darkened:
<br>4	And they shall shut the doors in the street, when the grinder’s voice shall be low, and they shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of music shall grow deaf.
<br>5	And they shall fear high things, and they shall be afraid in the way, the almond tree shall flourish, the locust shall be made fat, and the ca- per tree shall be destroyed: because man shall go into the house of his eternity, and the mourners shall go round about in the street.
<br> 
<br>6	Before the silver cord be broken, and the golden fillet shrink back, and the pitcher be crushed at the fountain, and the wheel be broken upon the cistern,
<br>7	And the dust return into its earth, from whence it was, and the spirit return to God, who gave it.
<br>8	Vanity of vanities, said Ecclesiastes, and all things are vanity.
<br>9	And whereas Ecclesiastes was very wise, he taught the people, and declared the things that he had done: and seeking out, he set forth many parables.
<br>10	He sought profitable words, and wrote words most right, and full of truth.
<br>11	The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails deeply fastened in, which by the counsel of masters are given from one shepherd.
<br>12	More than these, my son, require not. Of making many books there is no end: and much study is an affliction of the flesh.
<br>13	Let us all hear together the conclusion of the discourse. Fear God, and keep his command- ments: for this is all man:
<br>14	And all things that are done, God will bring into judgment for every error, whether it be good or evil.
<br>
<br>Chapter 1
<br>Let him kiss me with the kiss of his mouth: for thy breasts are better than wine,
<br>2	Smelling sweet of the best ointments. Thy name is as oil poured out: therefore young maid- ens have loved thee.
<br>3	Draw me: we will run after thee to the odour of thy ointments. The king hath brought me into his storerooms: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, remembering thy breasts more than wine:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>the rightous love thee.
<br>4	I am black but beautiful, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Cedar, as the curtains of Solomon.
<br>5	Do not consider me that I am brown, be- cause the sun hath altered my colour: the sons of my mother have fought against me, they have made me the keeper in the vineyards: my vine- yard I have not kept.
<br>6	Shew me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou liest in the mid- day, lest I begin to wander after the flocks of thy companions.
<br>7	If thou know not thyself, O fairest among women, go forth, and follow after the steps of the flocks, and feed thy kids beside the tents of the shepherds.
<br>8	To my company of horsemen, in Pharao’s chariots, have I likened thee, O my love.
<br>9	Thy cheeks are beautiful as the turtledove’s, thy neck as jewels.
<br>10	We will make thee chains of gold, inlaid with silver.
<br>11	While the king was at his repose, my spike- nard sent forth the odour thereof.
<br>12	A bundle of myrrh is my beloved to me, he shall abide between my breasts.
<br>13	A cluster of cypress my love is to me, in the vineyards of Engaddi.
<br>14	Behold thou are fair, O my love, behold thou are fair, thy eyes are as those of doves.
<br>15	Behold thou art fair, my beloved, and comely. Our bed is flourishing.
<br>16	The beams of our houses are of cedar, our rafters of cypress trees.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 2
<br>I am the flower of the field, and the lily of the valleys.
<br>2	As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.
<br>3	As the apple tree among the trees of the woods, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow, whom I desired: and his fruit was sweet to my palate.
<br>4	He brought me into the cellar of wine, he set in order charity in me.
<br>5	Stay me up with flowers, compass me about with apples: because I languish with love.
<br>6	His left hand is under my head, and his right hand shall embrace me.
<br>7	I adjure you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and the harts of the field, that you stir not up, nor make the beloved to awake, till she please.
<br>8	The voice of my beloved, behold he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping over the hills.
<br>9	My beloved is like a roe, or a young hart. Behold he standeth behind our wall, looking through the windows, looking through the lat- tices.
<br>10	Behold my beloved speaketh to me: Arise, make haste, my love, my dove, my beautiful one, and come.
<br>11	For winter is now past, the rain is over and gone.
<br>12	The flowers have appeared in our land, the time of pruning is come: the voice of the turtle is heard in our land:
<br>13	The fig tree hath put forth her green figs: the vines in flower yield their sweet smell. Arise, my love, my beautiful one, and come:
<br>14	My dove in the clefts of the rock, in the hollow places of the wall, shew me thy face, let
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>thy voice sound in my ears: for thy voice is sweet, and thy face comely.
<br>15	Catch us the little foxes that destroy the vines: for our vineyard hath flourished.
<br>16	My beloved to me, and I to him who feedeth among the lilies,
<br>17	Till the day break, and the shadows retire. Return: be like, my beloved, to a roe, or to a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.
<br>
<br>Chapter 3
<br>In my bed by night I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, and found him not.
<br>2	I will rise, and will go about the city: in the streets and the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, and I found him not.
<br>3	The watchmen who keep the city, found me: Have you seen him, whom my soul loveth?
<br>4	When I had a little passed by them, I found him whom my soul loveth: I held him: and I will not let him go, till I bring him into my mother’s house, and into the chamber of her that bore me. 5 I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes and the harts of the fields, that you stir
<br>not up, nor awake my beloved, till she please.
<br>6	Who is she that goeth up by the desert, as a pillar of smoke of aromatical spices, of myrrh, and frankincense, and of all the powders of the perfumer?
<br>7	Behold threescore valiant ones of the most valiant of Israel, surrounded the bed of Solomon? 8 All holding swords, and most expert in war: every man’s sword upon his thigh, because of
<br>fears in the night.
<br>9	King Solomon hath made him a litter of the wood of Libanus:
<br>10	The pillars thereof he made of silver, the
<br> 
<br>seat of gold, the going up of purple: the midst he covered with charity for the daughters of Jerusalem.
<br>11	Go forth, ye daughters of Sion, and see king Solomon in the diadem, wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of the joy of his heart.
<br>
<br>Chapter 4
<br>How beautiful art thou, my love, how beautiful art thou! thy eyes are doves’ eyes, besides what is hid within. Thy hair is as flocks of goats, which come up from mount Galaad.
<br>2	Thy teeth as flocks of sheep, that are shorn, which come up from the washing, all with twins, and there is none barren among them.
<br>3	Thy lips are as a scarlet lace: and thy speech sweet.   Thy cheeks are as a piece of a pomegranate, besides that which lieth hid within.
<br>4	Thy neck, is as the tower of David, which is built with bulwarks: a thousand bucklers hang upon it, all the armour of valiant men.
<br>5	Thy two breasts like two young roes that are twins, which feed among the lilies.
<br>6	Till the day break, and the shadows retire, I will go to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.
<br>7	Thou art all fair, O my love, and there is not a spot in thee.
<br>8	Come from Libanus, my spouse, come from Libanus, come: thou shalt be crowned from the top of Amana, from the top of Sanir and Her- mon, from the dens of the lions, from the moun- tains of the leopards.
<br>9	Thou hast wounded my heart, my sister, my spouse, thou hast wounded my heart with one of thy eyes, and with one hair of thy neck.
<br>10	How beautiful are thy breasts, my sister,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>my spouse! thy breasts are more beautiful than wine, and the sweet smell of thy ointments above all aromatical spices.
<br>11	Thy lips, my spouse, are as a dropping hon- eycomb, honey and milk are under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments, as the smell of frankincense.
<br>12	My sister, my spouse, is a garden enclosed, a garden enclosed, a fountain sealed up.
<br>13	Thy plants are a paradise of pomegranates with the fruits of the orchard. Cypress with spikenard.
<br>14	Spikenard and saffron, sweet cane and cin- namon, with all the trees of Libanus, myrrh and aloes with all the chief perfumes.
<br>15	The fountain of gardens: the well of liv- ing waters, which run with a strong stream from Libanus.
<br>16	Arise, O north wind, and come, O south wind, blow through my garden, and let the aro- matical spices thereof flow.
<br>
<br>Chapter 5
<br>Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat the fruit of his apple trees. I am come into my gar- den, O my sister, my spouse, I have gathered my myrrh, with my aromatical spices: I have eaten the honeycomb with my honey, I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends, and drink, and be inebriated, my dearly beloved.
<br>2	I sleep, and my heart watcheth: the voice of my beloved knocking: Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is full of dew, and my locks of the drops of the nights.
<br>3	I have put off my garment, how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet, how shall I defile them?
<br> 
<br>4	My beloved put his hand through the key hole, and my bowels were moved at his touch.
<br>5	I arose up to open to my beloved: my hands dropped with myrrh, and my fingers were full of the choicest myrrh.
<br>6	I opened the bolt of my door to my beloved: but he had turned aside, and was gone. My soul melted when he spoke: I sought him, and found him not: I called, and he did not answer me.
<br>7	The keepers that go about the city found me: they struck me: and wounded me: the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.
<br>8	I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if you find my beloved, that you tell him that I languish with love.
<br>9	What manner of one is thy beloved of the beloved, O thou most beautiful among women? what manner of one is thy beloved of the beloved, that thou hast so adjured us?
<br>10	My beloved is white and ruddy, chosen out of thousands.
<br>11	His head is as the finest gold: his locks as branches of palm trees, black as a raven.
<br>12	His eyes as doves upon brooks of waters, which are washed with milk, and sit beside the plentiful streams.
<br>13	His cheeks are as beds of aromatical spices set by the perfumers. His lips are as lilies drop- ping choice myrrh.
<br>14	His hands are turned and as of gold, full of hyacinths. His belly as of ivory, set with sap- phires.
<br>15	His legs as pillars of marble, that are set upon bases of gold. His form as of Libanus, ex- cellent as the cedars.
<br>16	His throat most sweet, and he is all lovely: such is my beloved, and he is my friend, O ye daughters of Jerusalem.
<br>17	Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou most beautiful among women? whither is thy beloved
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>turned aside, and we will seek him with thee?
<br>
<br>Chapter 6
<br>
<br>My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the bed of aromatical spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.
<br>2	I to my beloved, and my beloved to me, who feedeth among the lilies.
<br>3	Thou art beautiful, O my love, sweet and comely as Jerusalem terrible as an army set in array.
<br>4	Turn away thy eyes from me, for they have made me flee away. Thy hair is as a flock of goats, that appear from Galaad.
<br>5	Thy teeth as a flock of sheep, which come up from the washing, all with twins, and there is none barren among them.
<br>6	Thy cheeks are as the bark of a pomegranate, beside what is hidden within thee.
<br>7	There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and young maidens without number. 8 One is my dove, my perfect one is but one, she is the only one of her mother,  the chosen of her that bore her. The daughters saw her, and declared her most blessed: the queens and
<br>concubines, and they praised her.
<br>9	Who is she that cometh forth as the morn- ing rising, fair as the moon, bright as the sun, terrible as an army set in array?
<br>10	I went down into the garden of nuts, to see the fruits of the valleys, and to look if the vineyard had flourished, and the pomegranates budded.
<br>11	I knew not: my soul troubled me for the chariots of Aminadab.
<br>12	Return, return, O Sulamitess: return, re- turn that we may behold thee.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 7
<br>What shalt thou see in the Sulamitess but the companies of camps? How beautiful are thy steps in shoes, O prince’s daughter! The joints of thy thighs are like jewels, that are made by the hand of a skilful workman.
<br>2	Thy navel is like a round bowl never wanting cups. Thy belly is like a heap of wheat, set about with lilies.
<br>3	Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins.
<br>4	Thy neck as a tower of ivory. Thy eyes like the fishpools in Hesebon, which are in the gate of the daughter of the multitude. Thy nose is as the tower of Libanus, that looketh toward Dam- ascus.
<br>5	Thy head is like Carmel: and the hairs of thy head as the purple of the king bound in the channels.
<br>6	How beautiful art thou, and how comely, my dearest, in delights!
<br>7	Thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters of grapes.
<br>8	I said: I will go up into the palm tree, and will take hold of the fruit thereof: and thy breasts shall be as the clusters of the vine: and the odour of thy mouth like apples.
<br>9	Thy throat like the best wine, worthy for my beloved to drink, and for his lips and his teeth to ruminate.
<br>10	I to my beloved, and his turning is towards me.
<br>11	Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field, let us abide in the villages.
<br>12	Let us get up early to the vineyards, let us see if the vineyard flourish, if the flowers be ready to bring forth fruits, if the pomegranates flourish: there will I give thee my breasts.
<br>13	The mandrakes give a smell. In our gates
<br>

<br> 
<br>are all fruits: the new and the old, my beloved, I have kept for thee.
<br>
<br>Chapter 8
<br>Who shall give thee to me for my brother, suck- ing the breasts of my mother, that I may find thee without, and kiss thee, and now no man may despise me?
<br>2	I will take hold of thee, and bring thee into my mother’s house: there thou shalt teach me, and I will give thee a cup of spiced wine and new wine of my pomegranates.
<br>3	His left hand under my head, and his right hand shall embrace me.
<br>4	I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that you stir not up, nor awake my love till she please. 5 Who is this that cometh up from the desert, flowing with delights, leaning upon her beloved? Under the apple tree I raised thee up: there thy mother was corrupted, there she was defloured
<br>that bore thee.
<br>6	Put me as a seal upon thy heart, as a seal upon thy arm, for love is strong as death, jeal- ousy as hard as hell, the lamps thereof are fire and flames.
<br>7	Many waters cannot quench charity, neither can the floods drown it: if a man should give all the substance of his house for love, he shall despise it as nothing.
<br>8	Our sister is little, and hath no breasts. What shall we do to our sister in the day when she is to be spoken to?
<br>9	If she be a wall: let us build upon it bulwarks of silver: if she be a door, let us join it together with boards of cedar.
<br>10	I am a wall: and my breasts are as a tower since I am become in his presence as one finding peace.
<br> 
<br>11	The peaceable had a vineyard, in that which hath people: he let out the same to keep- ers, every man bringeth for the fruit thereof a thousand peices of silver.
<br>12	My vineyard is before me. A thousand are for thee, the peaceable, and two hundred for them that keep the fruit thereof.
<br>13	Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the friends hearken: make me hear thy voice.
<br>14	Flee away, O my beloved, and be like to the roe, and to the young hart upon the mountains of aromatical spices.

<br>Book of Wisdom
<br>
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>Love justice, you that are the judges of the earth. Think of the Lord in goodness, and seek him in simplicity of heart:
<br>2	For he is found by them that tempt him not: and he sheweth himself to them that have faith in him.
<br>3	For perverse thoughts separate from God: and his power, when it is tried, reproveth the unwise:
<br>4	For wisdom will not enter into a malicious soul, nor dwell in a body subject to sins.
<br>5	For the Holy Spirit of discipline will flee from the deceitful, and will withdraw himself from thoughts that are without understanding, and he shall not abide when iniquity cometh in.
<br>6	For the spirit of wisdom is benevolent, and will not acquit the evil speaker from his lips: for God is witness of his reins, and he is a true searcher of his heart, and a hearer of his tongue. 7 For the Spirit of the Lord hath filled the whole world:	and that which containeth all
<br>things, hath knowledge of the voice.
<br>8	Therefore he that speaketh unjust things, cannot be hid, neither shall the chastising judg- ment pass him by.
<br>9	For inquisition shall be made into the thoughts of the ungodly, and the hearing of his words shall come to God, to the chastising of his iniquities.
<br>10	For the ear of jealousy heareth all things,
<br> 
<br>
<br>and the tumult of murmuring shall not be hid.
<br>11	Keep yourselves, therefore, from murmur- ing, which profiteth nothing, and refrain your tongue from detraction, for an obscure speech shall not go for nought: and the mouth that be- lieth, killeth the soul.
<br>12	Seek not death in the error of your life, neither procure ye destruction by the works of your hands.
<br>13	For God made not death, neither hath he pleasure in the destruction of the living.
<br>14	For he created all things that they might be: and he made the nations of the earth for health: and there is no poison of destruction in them, nor kingdom of hell upon the earth.
<br>15	For justice is perpetual and immortal.
<br>16	But the wicked with works and words have called it to them: and esteeming it a friend, have fallen away and have made a covenant with it: because they are worthy to be of the part thereof.
<br>
<br>Chapter 2
<br>For they have said, reasoning with themselves, but not right: The time of our life is short and tedious, and in the end of a man there is no remedy, and no man hath been known to have returned from hell:
<br>2	For we are born of nothing, and after this we shall be as if we had not been: for the breath in our nostrils is smoke: and speech a spark to
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>move our heart,
<br>3	Which being put out, our body shall be ashes, and our spirit shall be poured abroad as soft air, and our life shall pass away as the trace of a cloud, and shall be dispersed as a mist, which is driven away by the beams of the sun, and overpowered with the heat thereof:
<br>4	And our name in time shall be forgotten, and no man shall have any remembrance of our works.
<br>5	For our time is as the passing of a shadow, and there is no going back of our end: for it is fast sealed, and no man returneth:
<br>6	Come, therefore, and let us enjoy the good things that are present, and let us speedily use the creatures as in youth.
<br>7	Let us fill ourselves with costly wine, and ointments: and let not the flower of the time pass by us.
<br>8	Let us crown ourselves with roses, before they be withered: let no meadow escape our riot. 9 Let none of us go without his part in luxury: let us every where leave tokens of joy: for this is
<br>our portion, and this our lot.
<br>10	Let us oppress the poor just man, and not spare the widow, nor honour thc ancient grey hairs of the aged.
<br>11	But let our strength be the law of justice: for that which is feeble is found to be nothing worth.
<br>12	Let us, therefore, lie in wait for the just, because he is not for our turn, and he is contrary to our doings, and upbraideth us with transgres- sions of the law, and divulgeth against us the sins of our way of life.
<br>13	He boasteth that he hath the knowledge of God, and calleth himself the son of God.
<br>14	He is become a censurer of our thoughts.
<br>15	He is grievous unto us, even to behold: for his life is not like other men’s, and his ways are
<br> 
<br>very different.
<br>16	We are esteemed by him as triflers, and he abstaineth from our ways as from filthiness, and he preferreth the latter end of the just, and glorieth that he hath God for his father.
<br>17	Let us see then if his words be true, and let us prove what shall happen to him, and we shall know what his end shall be.
<br>18	For if he be the true son of God, he will defend him, and will deliver him from the hands of his enemies.
<br>19	Let us examine him by outrages and tor- tures, that we may know his meekness, and try his patience.
<br>20	Let us condemn him to a most shameful death: for there shall be respect had unto him by his words.
<br>21	These things they thought, and were de- ceived: for their own malice blinded them.
<br>22	And they knew not the secrets of God, nor hoped for the wages of justice, nor esteemed the honour of holy souls.
<br>23	For God created man incorruptible, and to the image of his own likeness he made him.
<br>24	But by the envy of the devil, death came into the world:
<br>25	And they follow him that are of his side.
<br>
<br>Chapter 3
<br>
<br>But the souls of the just are in the hand of God, and the torment of death shall not touch them. 2 In the sight of the unwise they seemed to
<br>die: and their departure was taken for misery:
<br>3	And their going away from us, for utter de- struction: but they are in peace.
<br>4	And though in the sight of men they suffered torments, their hope is full of immortality.
