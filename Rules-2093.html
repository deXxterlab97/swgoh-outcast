<br>
<br>In subsection (a), before paragraph (1), the words "or either of them" are omitted as unnecessary. The words "are liable for personal injury to a passenger or damage to a passenger's baggage" are substituted for "Whenever damage is sustained by any passenger or his baggage" and "shall be liable to each and every person so injured" for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words. The words "from explosion, fire, collision, or other cause" are omitted as unnecessary. The words "caused by" are substituted for "if it happens through" to eliminate unnecessary words. In paragraph (1), the words "part B or F of subtitle II of this title" are substituted for "title 52 of the Revised Statutes" because of the prior codification of subtitle II of title 46. In paragraph (2), the word "imperfections" is omitted as included in "defect".
<br>
<br>Subsection (b) is substituted for "to the full amount of damage" for clarity. See Hines v. Butler, 278 F. 877, 880, 881 (4th Cir. 1921), cert. denied, 257 U.S. 659 (1922); The Annie Faxon, 75 F. 312, 317–319 (9th Cir. 1896).

<br>
<br>(1) negligence or willful misconduct; or
<br>

<br>
<br>In subsection (a), the words "A seaman injured in the course of employment or, if the seaman dies from the injury, the personal representative of the seaman" are substituted for "Any seaman who shall suffer personal injury in the course of his employment" and "in case of the death of any seaman as a result of any such personal injury the personal representative" to eliminate unnecessary words. The words "bring a civil action" are substituted for "maintain an action" for consistency with rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 App. U.S.C.). The words "for damages" are omitted as unnecessary. The words "against the employer" are added for clarity. The words "Laws of the United States regulating recovery for personal injury to, or death of, a railway employee" are substituted for "all statutes of the United States modifying or extending the common-law right or remedy in cases of personal injury to railway employees" and "all statutes of the United States conferring or regulating the right of action for death in the case of railway employees" to eliminate unnecessary words.
<br>
<br>In subsection (b), the words "An action under this section shall be brought" are substituted for "Jurisdiction in such actions shall be under" because 46 App. U.S.C. 688(a) (last sentence) provides for venue, not jurisdiction. Panama R.R. Co. v. Johnson, 264 U.S. 375 (1924). As to the relationship between 46 App. U.S.C. 688(a) (last sentence) and 28 U.S.C. 1391(c), see Pure Oil Co. v. Suarez, 384 U.S. 202 (1966).

<br>  	46 App.:189 	June 26, 1884, ch. 121, §18, 23 Stat. 57.
<br>
<br>In subsection (a), the words "Except as provided in section 30506 of this title" are substituted for "except in the cases provided for in subsection (b) of this section" because 46 App. U.S.C. 183(b) is restated in section 30506 of the revised title. The words "whether American or foreign" are omitted as unnecessary because of section 30502 of the revised title. The words "shall not exceed the value of the vessel and pending freight" are substituted for "shall not . . . exceed the amount or value of . . . such vessel, and her freight then pending" in 46 App. U.S.C. 183(a) and for "the aggregate liabilities of all the owners of a vessel on account of the same shall not exceed the value of such vessels and freight pending" in 46 App. U.S.C. 189 for consistency and to eliminate unnecessary words. The last sentence is substituted for "the interest of such owner in" in 46 App. U.S.C. 183(a) and for "The individual liability of a shipowner shall be limited to the proportion of any or all debts and liabilities that his individual share of the vessel bears to the whole" in 46 App. U.S.C. 189 for clarity and consistency. The words "Provided, That this provision shall not prevent any claimant from joining all the owners in one action" in 46 App. U.S.C. 189 are omitted as unnecessary.
<br>
<br>Subsection (c) is substituted for "nor shall the same apply to wages due to persons employed by said shipowners" in 46 App. U.S.C. 189 because of the reorganization of the source provisions.
<br>§30506. Limit of liability for personal injury or death
<br>
<br>(a) Application.—This section applies only to seagoing vessels, but does not apply to pleasure yachts, tugs, towboats, towing vessels, tank vessels, fishing vessels, fish tender vessels, canal boats, scows, car floats, barges, lighters, or nondescript vessels.
<br>
<br>(b) Minimum Liability.—If the amount of the vessel owner's liability determined under section 30505 of this title is insufficient to pay all losses in full, and the portion available to pay claims for personal injury or death is less than $420 times the tonnage of the vessel, that portion shall be increased to $420 times the tonnage of the vessel. That portion may be used only to pay claims for personal injury or death.
<br>
<br>(c) Calculation of Tonnage.—Under subsection (b), the tonnage of a self-propelled vessel is the gross tonnage without deduction for engine room, and the tonnage of a sailing vessel is the tonnage for documentation. However, space for the use of seamen is excluded.
<br>
<br>(d) Claims Arising on Distinct Occasions.—Separate limits of liability apply to claims for personal injury or death arising on distinct occasions.
<br>
<br>(e) Privity or Knowledge.—In a claim for personal injury or death, the privity or knowledge of the master or the owner's superintendent or managing agent, at or before the beginning of each voyage, is imputed to the owner.

<br>
<br>(2) bringing a civil action for personal injury or death to less than one year after the date of the injury or death.
<br>
<br>(c) Effect of Failure To Give Notice.—When notice of a claim for personal injury or death is required by a contract, the failure to give the notice is not a bar to recovery if—
<br>
<br>(1) the court finds that the owner, master, or agent of the vessel had knowledge of the injury or death and the owner has not been prejudiced by the failure;
<br>
<br>(2) the court finds there was a satisfactory reason why the notice could not have been given; or
<br>
<br>(3) the owner of the vessel fails to object to the failure to give the notice.
<br>
<br>(d) Tolling of Period To Give Notice.—If a claimant is a minor or mental incompetent, or if a claim is for wrongful death, any period provided by a contract for giving notice of the claim is tolled until the earlier of—
<br>
<br>(1) the date a legal representative is appointed for the minor, incompetent, or decedent's estate; or
<br>

<br>
<br>This chapter codifies the Act of February 13, 1893 (ch. 105, 27 Stat. 445) (commonly known as the Harter Act). Changes are made to simplify, clarify, and modernize the language and style, but the intent is that these changes should not result in changes in substance.
<br>
<br>A definition of "carrier" is added based on language appearing in various provisions of the Harter Act. The definition avoids the need to repeat in various sections of this chapter the list of persons to whom the requirements and restrictions of this chapter apply, and it ensures that the list of persons is consistent in the chapter.
