<br>SUBCHAPTER I—EQUAL EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES
<br>Part 1—Policy and Purpose
<br>§1701. Congressional declaration of policy
<br>(a) Entitlement to equal educational opportunity; neighborhood as appropriate basis
<br>
<br>The Congress declares it to be the policy of the United States that—
<br>
<br>(1) all children enrolled in public schools are entitled to equal educational opportunity without regard to race, color, sex, or national origin; and
<br>
<br>(2) the neighborhood is the appropriate basis for determining public school assignments.
<br>(b) Purpose
<br>
<br>In order to carry out this policy, it is the purpose of this subchapter to specify appropriate remedies for the orderly removal of the vestiges of the dual school system.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 93–380, title II, §202, Aug. 21, 1974, 88 Stat. 514.)
<br>Effective Date
<br>
<br>Section effective on and after sixtieth day after Aug. 21, 1974, see section 2(c) of Pub. L. 93–380, set out as a note under section 1221–1 of this title.
<br>Short Title
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 93–380, title II, §201, Aug. 21, 1974, 88 Stat. 514, provided that: "This title [enacting this chapter and section 1228 of this title and amending section 1608 of this title] may be cited as the 'Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974'."
<br>§1702. Congressional findings
<br>(a) Dual school systems as denial of equal protection; depletion of financial resources of local educational agencies; transportation of students; inadequacy of guidelines
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) the maintenance of dual school systems in which students are assigned to schools solely on the basis of race, color, sex, or national origin denies to those students the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment;
<br>
<br>(2) for the purpose of abolishing dual school systems and eliminating the vestiges thereof, many local educational agencies have been required to reorganize their school systems, to reassign students, and to engage in the extensive transportation of students;
<br>
<br>(3) the implementation of desegregation plans that require extensive student transportation has, in many cases, required local educational agencies to expend large amounts of funds, thereby depleting their financial resources available for the maintenance or improvement of the quality of educational facilities and instruction provided;
<br>
<br>(4) transportation of students which creates serious risks to their health and safety, disrupts the educational process carried out with respect to such students, and impinges significantly on their educational opportunity, is excessive;
<br>
<br>(5) the risks and harms created by excessive transportation are particularly great for children enrolled in the first six grades; and
<br>
<br>(6) the guidelines provided by the courts for fashioning remedies to dismantle dual school systems have been, as the Supreme Court of the United States has said, "incomplete and imperfect," and have not established, a clear, rational, and uniform standard for determining the extent to which a local educational agency is required to reassign and transport its students in order to eliminate the vestiges of a dual school system.
<br>(b) Necessity of Congress to specify appropriate remedies for elimination of dual school systems
<br>
<br>For the foregoing reasons, it is necessary and proper that the Congress, pursuant to the powers granted to it by the Constitution of the United States, specify appropriate remedies for the elimination of the vestiges of dual school systems, except that the provisions of this chapter are not intended to modify or diminish the authority of the courts of the United States to enforce fully the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the Constitution of the United States.

<br>Part 2—Unlawful Practices
<br>§1703. Denial of equal educational opportunity prohibited
<br>
<br>No State shall deny equal educational opportunity to an individual on account of his or her race, color, sex, or national origin, by—
<br>
<br>(a) the deliberate segregation by an educational agency of students on the basis of race, color, or national origin among or within schools;
<br>
<br>(b) the failure of an educational agency which has formerly practiced such deliberate segregation to take affirmative steps, consistent with part 4 of this subchapter, to remove the vestiges of a dual school system;
<br>
<br>(c) the assignment by an educational agency of a student to a school, other than the one closest to his or her place of residence within the school district in which he or she resides, if the assignment results in a greater degree of segregation of students on the basis of race, color, sex, or national origin among the schools of such agency than would result if such student were assigned to the school closest to his or her place of residence within the school district of such agency providing the appropriate grade level and type of education for such student;
<br>
<br>(d) discrimination by an educational agency on the basis of race, color, or national origin in the employment, employment conditions, or assignment to schools of its faculty or staff, except to fulfill the purposes of subsection (f) below;
<br>
<br>(e) the transfer by an educational agency, whether voluntary or otherwise, of a student from one school to another if the purpose and effect of such transfer is to increase segregation of students on the basis of race, color, or national origin among the schools of such agency; or
<br>
<br>(f) the failure by an educational agency to take appropriate action to overcome language barriers that impede equal participation by its students in its instructional programs.

<br>§1704. Balance not required
<br>
<br>The failure of an educational agency to attain a balance, on the basis of race, color, sex, or national origin, of students among its schools shall not constitute a denial of equal educational opportunity, or equal protection of the laws.

<br>§1705. Assignment on neighborhood basis not a denial of equal educational opportunity
<br>
<br>Subject to the other provisions of this subchapter, the assignment by an educational agency of a student to the school nearest his place of residence which provides the appropriate grade level and type of education for such student is not a denial of equal educational opportunity or of equal protection of the laws unless such assignment is for the purpose of segregating students on the basis of race, color, sex, or national origin, or the school to which such student is assigned was located on its site for the purpose of segregating students on such basis.

<br>
<br>When a court of competent jurisdiction determines that a school system is desegregated, or that it meets the constitutional requirements, or that it is a unitary system, or that it has no vestiges of a dual system, and thereafter residential shifts in population occur which result in school population changes in any school within such a desegregated school system, such school population changes so occurring shall not, per se, constitute a cause for civil action for a new plan of desegregation or for modification of the court approved plan.

<br>
<br>(a) assigning students to the schools closest to their places of residence which provide the appropriate grade level and type of education for such students, taking into account school capacities and natural physical barriers;
<br>
<br>(b) assigning students to the schools closest to their places of residence which provide the appropriate grade level and type of education for such students, taking into account only school capacities;
<br>
<br>(c) permitting students to transfer from a school in which a majority of the students are of their race, color, or national origin to a school in which a minority of the students are of their race, color, or national origin;
<br>
<br>(d) the creation or revision of attendance zones or grade structures without requiring transportation beyond that described in section 1714 of this title;
<br>
<br>(e) the construction of new schools or the closing of inferior schools;
<br>
<br>(f) the construction or establishment of magnet schools; or

<br>§1714. Transportation of students
<br>(a) Limitation to school closest or next closest to place of residence
<br>
<br>No court, department, or agency of the United States shall, pursuant to section 1713 of this title, order the implementation of a plan that would require the transportation of any student to a school other than the school closest or next closest to his place of residence which provides the appropriate grade level and type of education for such student.
<br>(b) Health risks; impingement on educational process
<br>
<br>No court, department, or agency of the United States shall require directly or indirectly the transportation of any student if such transportation poses a risk to the health of such student or constitutes a significant impingement on the educational process with respect to such student.
<br>(c) School population changes resulting from population changes
<br>
<br>When a court of competent jurisdiction determines that a school system is desegregated, or that it meets the constitutional requirements, or that it is a unitary system, or that it has no vestiges of a dual system, and thereafter residential shifts in population occur which result in school population changes in any school within such a desegregated school system, no educational agency because of such shifts shall be required by any court, department, or agency of the United States to formulate, or implement any new desegregation plan, or modify or implement any modification of the court approved desegregation plan, which would require transportation of students to compensate wholly or in part for such shifts in school population so occurring.
