<br>Saith the LORD of hosts; Therefore take heed to your spirit, That ye deal not treacherously.
<br>
<br>17Ye have wearied the LORD with your words.
<br>Yet ye say: ‘Wherein have we wearied Him?’
<br>In that ye say: ‘Every one that doeth evil
<br> 
<br>Is good in the sight of the LORD, And He delighteth in them;
<br>Or where is the God of justice?’
<br>
<br>Behold, I send My messenger, And he shall clear the way before
<br>Me;
<br>And the Lord, whom ye seek,
<br>Will suddenly come to His temple, And the messenger of the covenant, Whom ye delight in,
<br>Behold, he cometh, Saith the LORD of hosts.
<br>2But who may abide the day of his coming?
<br>And who shall stand when he appeareth?
<br>For he is like a refiner’s fire, And like fullers’soap;
<br>3And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver;
<br>And he shall purify the sons of Levi, And purge them as gold and silver;
<br>And there shall be they that shall offer unto the LORD
<br>Offerings in righteousness.
<br>4Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem
<br>Be pleasant unto the LORD, As in the days of old,
<br>And as in ancient years.
<br>
<br>5And I will come near to you to judgment;
<br>And I will be a swift witness Against the sorcerers, and against
<br>the adulterers,
<br>And against false swearers;
<br> 
<br>And against those that oppress the hireling in his wages,
<br>The widow, and the fatherless,
<br>And that turn aside the stranger from his right,
<br>And fear not Me,
<br>Saith the LORD of hosts.
<br>6For I the LORD change not;
<br>And ye, O sons of Jacob, are not consumed.
<br>
<br>7From the days of your fathers ye have turned aside
<br>From Mine ordinances, and have not kept them.
<br>Return unto Me, and I will return unto you,
<br>Saith the LORD of hosts.
<br>But ye say: ‘Wherein shall we return?’
<br>8Will a man rob God? Yet ye rob Me.
<br>But ye say: ‘Wherein have we robbed Thee?’
<br>In tithes and heave-offerings. 9Ye are cursed with the curse, Yet ye rob Me,
<br>Even this whole nation.
<br>10Bring ye the whole tithe into the store-house,
<br>That there may be food in My house,
<br>And try Me now herewith, Saith the LORD of hosts,
<br>If I will not open you the windows of heaven,
<br>And pour you out a blessing,
<br>That there shall be more than sufficiency.
<br> 
<br>11And I will rebuke the devourer for your good,
<br>And he shall not destroy the fruits of your land;
<br>Neither shall your vine cast its fruit before the time in the field,
<br>Saith the LORD of hosts.
<br>12And all nations shall call you happy;
<br>For ye shall be a delightsome land, Saith the LORD of hosts.
<br>
<br>13Your words have been all too strong against Me,
<br>Saith the LORD.
<br>Yet ye say: ‘Wherein have we spoken against thee?’
<br>14Ye have said: ‘It is vain to serve God;
<br>And what profit is it that we have kept His charge,
<br>And that we have walked mournfully
<br>Because of the LORD of hosts?
<br>15And now we call the proud happy;
<br>Yea, they that work wickedness are built up;
<br>Yea, they try God, and are delivered.’
<br>16Then they that feared the LORD Spoke one with another;
<br>And the LORD hearkened, and heard,
<br>And a book of remembrance was written before Him,
<br>For them that feared the LORD, and that thought upon His name.
<br>17And they shall be Mine, saith the LORD of hosts,
<br> 
<br>In the day that I do make, even Mine own treasure;
<br>And I will spare them, as a man spareth
<br>His own son that serveth him.
<br>18Then shall ye again discern between the righteous and the wicked,
<br>Between him that serveth God And him that serveth Him not. 19For, behold, the day cometh, It burneth as a furnace;
<br>And all the proud, and all that work wickedness, shall be stubble;
<br>And the day that cometh shall set them ablaze,
<br>Saith the LORD of hosts,
<br>That it shall leave them neither root nor branch.
<br>20But unto you that fear My name Shall the sun of righteousness arise
<br>with healing in its wings;
<br>And ye shall go forth, and gambol As calves of the stall.
<br>21And ye shall tread down the wicked;
<br>For they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet
<br>In the day that I do make, Saith the LORD of hosts.
<br>
<br>22Remember ye the law of Moses My servant,
<br>Which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel,
<br>Even statutes and ordinances. 23Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet
<br>Before the coming
<br> 
<br>Of the great and terrible day of the LORD.
<br>24And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children,
<br> 
<br>And the heart of the children to their fathers;
<br>Lest I come and smite the land with utter destruction.
<br> 
<br>
<br>Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet Before the coming
<br>Of the great and terrible day of the LORD.

<br>Why are the nations in an uproar?
<br> 
<br>BOOK I
<br>HAPPY IS the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the wicked,
<br>Nor stood in the way of sinners, Nor sat in the seat of the scornful. 2But his delight is in the law of the
<br>LORD;
<br>And in His law doth he meditate day and night.
<br>3And he shall be like a tree planted by streams of water,
<br>That bringeth forth its fruit in its season,
<br>And whose leaf doth not wither;
<br>And in whatsoever he doeth he shall prosper.
<br>
<br>4Not so the wicked;
<br>But they are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.
<br>5Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment,
<br>Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
<br>6For the LORD regardeth the way of the righteous;
<br>But the way of the wicked shall perish.
<br> 
<br>And why do the peoples mutter in vain?
<br>2 The kings of the earth stand up, And the rulers take counsel together,
<br>Against the LORD, and against His anointed:
<br>3 'Let us break their bands asunder, And cast away their cords from us.'
<br>
<br>4 He that sitteth in heaven laugheth, The Lord hath them in derision.
<br>5 Then will He speak unto them in His wrath,
<br>And affright them in His sore displeasure:
<br>6 'Truly it is I that have established My king
<br>Upon Zion, My holy mountain.'
<br>
<br>7 I will tell of the decree:
<br>The LORD said unto me: 'Thou art My son,
<br>This day have I begotten thee.
<br>8 Ask of Me, and I will give the nations for thine inheritance,
<br>And the ends of the earth for thy possession.
<br>9 Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron;
<br>Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.'
<br> 
<br>
<br>10 Now therefore, O ye kings, be wise;
<br>Be admonished, ye judges of the earth.
<br>11Serve the LORD with fear, And rejoice with trembling.
<br>12Do homage in purity, lest He be angry, and ye perish in the way,
<br>When suddenly His wrath is kindled.
<br>
<br>Happy are all they that take refuge in Him.
<br>
<br>A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son.
<br>
<br>2LORD, how many are mine adversaries become!
<br>Many are they that rise up against me.
<br>3Many there are that say of my soul: 'There is no salvation for him in
<br>God.'	Selah
<br>
<br>4But thou, O LORD, art a shield about me;
<br>My glory, and the lifter up of my head.
<br>5With my voice I call unto the LORD,
<br>And He answereth me out of His holy mountain.	Selah
<br>
<br>6I lay me down, and I sleep;
<br>I awake, for the LORD sustaineth me.
<br>7I am not afraid of ten thousands of people,
<br> 
<br>That have set themselves against me round about.
<br>
<br>8Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God;
<br>For Thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek,
<br>Thou hast broken the teeth of the wicked.
<br>
<br>9Salvation belongeth unto the LORD; Thy blessing be upon Thy people.
<br>Selah
<br>
<br>For the Leader; with string-music. A Psalm of David.
<br>
<br>2Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness,
<br>Thou who didst set me free when I was in distress;
<br>Be gracious unto me, and hear my prayer.
<br>3O ye sons of men, how long shall my glory be put to shame,
<br>In that ye love vanity, and seek after falsehood?	Selah
<br>4But know that the LORD hath set apart the godly man as His own;
<br>The LORD will hear when I call unto Him.
<br>
<br>5Tremble, and sin not;
<br>Commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah
<br>6Offer the sacrifices of righteousness,
<br>And put your trust in the LORD.
<br> 
<br>7Many there are that say: 'Oh that we could see some good!'
<br>LORD, lift Thou up the light of Thy countenance upon us.
<br>8Thou hast put gladness in my heart,
<br>More than when their corn and their wine increase.
<br>9In peace will I both lay me down and sleep;
<br>For Thou, LORD, makest me dwell alone in safety.
<br>
<br>For the Leader; upon the Nehiloth. A Psalm of David.
<br>
<br>2Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.
<br>3Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God;
<br>For unto Thee do I pray.
<br>
<br>4O LORD, in the morning shalt Thou hear my voice;
<br>In the morning will I order my prayer unto Thee, and will look forward.
<br>5For Thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness;
<br>Evil shall not sojourn with Thee.
<br>6The boasters shall not stand in Thy sight;
<br>Thou hatest all workers of iniquity.
<br>7Thou destroyest them that speak falsehood;
<br>The LORD abhorreth the man of blood and of deceit.
<br>8But as for me, in the abundance of Thy lovingkindness will I come into Thy house;
<br> 
<br>I will bow down toward Thy holy temple in the fear of Thee.
<br>
<br>9O LORD, lead me in Thy righteousness because of them that lie in wait for me;
<br>Make Thy way straight before my face.
<br>10For there is no sincerity in their mouth;
<br>Their inward part is a yawning gulf, Their throat is an open sepulchre; They make smooth their tongue.
<br>11Hold them guilty, O God,
<br>Let them fall by their own counsels;
<br>Cast them down in the multitude of their transgressions;
<br>For they have rebelled against Thee.
<br>
<br>12So shall all those that take refuge in Thee rejoice,
<br>They shall ever shout for joy, And Thou shalt shelter them;
<br>Let them also that love Thy name exult in Thee.
<br>13For Thou dost bless the righteous;
<br>O LORD, Thou dost encompass him with favour as with a shield.
<br>
<br>For the Leader; with string-music; on the Sheminith. A Psalm of David.
<br>
<br>2O LORD, rebuke me not in Thine anger,
<br>Neither chasten me in Thy wrath.
<br>3Be gracious unto me, O LORD, for I languish away;
<br> 
<br>Heal me, O LORD, for my bones are affrighted.
<br>4My soul also is sore affrighted; And Thou, O LORD, how long?
<br>
<br>5Return, O LORD, deliver my soul; Save me for Thy mercy's sake.
<br>6For in death there is no remembrance of Thee;
<br>In the nether-world who will give Thee thanks?
<br>7I am weary with my groaning; Every night make I my bed to swim;
<br>I melt away my couch with my tears.
<br>8Mine eye is dimmed because of vexation;
<br>It waxeth old because of all mine adversaries.
<br>
<br>9Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity;
<br>For the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping.
<br>10The LORD hath heard my supplication;
<br>The LORD receiveth my prayer.
<br>11All mine enemies shall be ashamed and sore affrighted;
<br>They shall turn back, they shall be ashamed suddenly.
<br>
<br>Shiggaion of David, which he sang unto the LORD, concerning
<br>Cush a Benjamite.
<br>
<br>2O LORD my God, in Thee have I taken refuge;
<br> 
<br>Save me from all them that pursue me, and deliver me;
<br>3Lest he tear my soul like a lion,
<br>Rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.
<br>
<br>4O LORD my God, if I have done this;
<br>If there be iniquity in my hands;
<br>5If I have requited him that did evil unto me,
<br>Or spoiled mine adversary unto emptiness;
<br>6Let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it,
<br>And tread my life down to the earth;
<br>Yea, let him lay my glory in the dust.	Selah
<br>
<br>7Arise, O LORD, in Thine anger,
<br>Lift up Thyself in indignation against mine adversaries;
<br>Yea, awake for me at the judgment which Thou hast commanded.
<br>8And let the congregation of the peoples compass Thee about,
<br>And over them return Thou on high.
<br>
<br>9O LORD, who ministerest judgment to the peoples,
<br>Judge me, O LORD,
<br>According to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is in me.
<br>10Oh that a full measure of evil might come upon the wicked,
<br>And that Thou wouldest establish the righteous;
<br> 
<br>For the righteous God trieth the heart and reins.
<br>11My shield is with God,
<br>Who saveth the upright in heart.
<br>12God is a righteous judge,
<br>Yea, a God that hath indignation every day:
<br>13If a man turn not, He will whet His sword,
<br>He hath bent His bow, and made it ready;
<br>14He hath also prepared for him the weapons of death,
<br>Yea, His arrows which He made sharp.
<br>15Behold, he travaileth with iniquity;
<br>Yea, he conceiveth mischief, and bringeth forth falsehood.
<br>16He hath digged a pit, and hollowed it,
<br>And is fallen into the ditch which he made.
<br>17His mischief shall return upon his own head,
<br>And his violence shall come down upon his own pate.
<br>
<br>18I will give thanks unto the LORD according to His righteousness;
<br>And will sing praise to the name of the LORD Most High.
<br>
<br>For the Leader; upon the Gittith. A Psalm of David.
<br>
<br>2O LORD, our Lord,
<br>How glorious is Thy name in all the earth!
<br> 
<br>Whose majesty is rehearsed above the heavens.
<br>3Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast Thou founded strength,
<br>Because of Thine adversaries;
<br>That Thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.
<br>
<br>4When I behold Thy heavens, the work of Thy fingers,
<br>The moon and the stars, which Thou hast established;
<br>5What is man, that Thou art mindful of him?
<br>And the son of man, that Thou thinkest of him?
<br>6Yet Thou hast made him but little lower than the angels,
<br>And hast crowned him with glory and honour.
<br>7Thou hast made him to have dominion over the works of Thy hands;
<br>Thou hast put all things under His feet:
<br>8Sheep and oxen, all of them, Yea, and the beasts of the field;
<br>9The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea;
<br>Whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.
<br>
<br>10O LORD, our Lord,
<br>How glorious is Thy name in all the earth!
<br>
<br>For the Leader; upon Muthlabben. A Psalm of David.
<br> 
<br>
<br>2I will give thanks unto the LORD with my whole heart;
<br>I will tell of all Thy marvellous works.
<br>3I will be glad and exult in Thee; I will sing praise to Thy name, O
<br>Most High:
<br>
<br>4When mine enemies are turned back,
<br>They stumble and perish at Thy presence;
<br>5For Thou hast maintained my right and my cause;
<br>Thou sattest upon the throne as the righteous Judge.
<br>
<br>6Thou hast rebuked the nations, Thou hast destroyed the wicked,
<br>Thou hast blotted out their name for ever and ever.
<br>7O thou enemy, the waste places are come to an end for ever;
<br>And the cities which thou didst uproot,
<br>Their very memorial is perished.
<br>
<br>8But the LORD is enthroned for ever;
<br>He hath established His throne for judgment.
<br>9And He will judge the world in righteousness,
<br>He will minister judgment to the peoples with equity.
<br>
<br>10The LORD also will be a high tower for the oppressed,
<br>A high tower in times of trouble;
<br> 
<br>11And they that know Thy name will put their trust in Thee;
<br>For thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek Thee.
<br>
<br>12Sing praises to the LORD, who dwelleth in Zion;
<br>Declare among the peoples His doings.
<br>13For He that avengeth blood hath remembered them;
<br>He hath not forgotten the cry of the humble.
<br>
<br>14Be gracious unto me, O LORD,
<br>Behold mine affliction at the hands of them that hate me;
<br>Thou that liftest me up from the gates of death;
<br>15That I may tell of all Thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion, That I may rejoice in Thy salvation.
<br>
<br>16The nations are sunk down in the pit that they made;
<br>In the net which they hid is their own foot taken.
<br>17The LORD hath made Himself known, He hath executed judgment,
<br>The wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion.	Selah
<br>
<br>18The wicked shall return to the nether-world,
<br>Even all the nations that forget God.
<br>19For the needy shall not alway be forgotten,
<br> 
<br>Nor the expectation of the poor perish for ever.
<br>20Arise, O LORD, let not man prevail;
<br>Let the nations be judged in Thy sight.
<br>21Set terror over them, O LORD;
<br>Let the nations know they are but men.	Selah
<br>
<br>Why standest Thou afar off, O LORD?
<br>Why hidest Thou Thyself in times of trouble?
<br>2Through the pride of the wicked the poor is hotly pursued,
<br>They are taken in the devices that they have imagined.
<br>
<br>3For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire,
<br>And the covetous vaunteth himself, though he contemn the LORD.
<br>4The wicked, in the pride of his countenance [, saith]: 'He will not require';
<br>All his thoughts are: 'There is no God.'
<br>5His ways prosper at all times;
<br>Thy judgments are far above out of his sight;
<br>As for all his adversaries, he puffeth at them.
<br>6He saith in his heart: 'I shall not be moved,
<br>I who to all generations shall not be in adversity.'
<br>7His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and oppression;
<br> 
<br>Under his tongue is mischief and iniquity.
<br>8He sitteth in the lurking-places of the villages;
<br>In secret places doth he slay the innocent;
<br>His eyes are on the watch for the helpless.
<br>9He lieth in wait in a secret place as a lion in his lair,
<br>He lieth in wait to catch the poor;
<br>He doth catch the poor, when he draweth him up in his net.
<br>10He croucheth, he boweth down,
<br>And the helpless fall into his mighty claws.
<br>11He hath said in his heart: 'God hath forgotten;
<br>He hideth His face; He will never see.'
<br>
<br>12Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up Thy hand;
<br>Forget not the humble.
<br>13Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God,
<br>And say in his heart: 'Thou wilt not require'?
<br>14Thou hast seen; for Thou beholdest trouble and vexation, to requite them with Thy hand;
<br>Unto Thee the helpless committeth himself;
<br>Thou hast been the helper of the fatherless.
<br>
<br>15Break Thou the arm of the wicked;
<br> 
<br>And as for the evil man, search out his wickedness, till none be found.
<br>16The LORD is King for ever and ever;
<br>The nations are perished out of His land.
<br>
<br>17LORD, Thou hast heard the desire of the humble:
<br>Thou wilt direct their heart, Thou wilt cause Thine ear to attend;
<br>18To right the fatherless and the oppressed,
<br>That man who is of the earth may be terrible no more.
<br>
<br>For the Leader. [A Psalm] of David.
<br>
<br>In the LORD have I taken refuge; How say ye to my soul:
<br>'Flee thou! to your mountain, ye birds'?
<br>
<br>2For, lo, the wicked bend the bow,
<br>They have made ready their arrow upon the string,
<br>That they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart.
<br>3When the foundations are destroyed,
<br>What hath the righteous wrought?
<br>
<br>4The LORD is in His holy temple, The LORD, His throne is in heaven;
<br>His eyes behold, His eyelids try, the children of men.
<br>5The LORD trieth the righteous;
<br> 
<br>But the wicked and him that loveth violence His soul hateth.
<br>6Upon the wicked He will cause to rain coals;
<br>Fire and brimstone and burning wind shall be the portion of their cup.
<br>
<br>7For the LORD is righteous, He loveth righteousness;
<br>The upright shall behold His face.
<br>
<br>For the Leader; on the Sheminith. A Psalm of David.
<br>
<br>2Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth;
<br>For the faithful fail from among the children of men.
<br>3They speak falsehood every one with his neighbour;
<br>With flattering lip, and with a double heart, do they speak.
<br>
<br>4May the LORD cut off all flattering lips,
<br>The tongue that speaketh proud things!
<br>5Who have said: 'Our tongue will we make mighty;
<br>Our lips are with us: who is lord over us?'
<br>
<br>6'For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy,
<br>Now will I arise', saith the LORD; 'I will set him in safety at whom
<br>they puff.'
<br> 
<br>7The words of the LORD are pure words,
<br>As silver tried in a crucible on the earth, refined seven times.
<br>
<br>8Thou wilt keep them, O LORD;
<br>Thou wilt preserve us from this generation for ever.
<br>9The wicked walk on every side,
<br>When vileness is exalted among the sons of men.
<br>
<br>For the Leader. A Psalm of David.
<br>
<br>2How long, O LORD, wilt Thou forget me for ever?
<br>How long wilt Thou hide Thy face from me?
<br>3How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart by day?
<br>How long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?
<br>4Behold Thou, and answer me, O LORD my God;
<br>Lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death;
<br>5Lest mine enemy say: 'I have prevailed against him';
<br>Lest mine adversaries rejoice when I am moved.
<br>
<br>6But as for me, in Thy mercy do I trust;
<br>My heart shall rejoice in Thy salvation.
<br>6I will sing unto the LORD,
<br> 
<br>Because He hath dealt bountifully with me.
<br>
<br>For the Leader. [A Psalm] of David.
<br>
<br>The fool hath said in his heart: 'There is no God';
<br>They have dealt corruptly, they have done abominably;
<br>There is none that doeth good.
<br>2The LORD looked forth from heaven upon the children of men,
<br>To see if there were any man of understanding, that did seek after God.
<br>3They are all corrupt, they are together become impure;
<br>There is none that doeth good, no, not one.
<br>
<br>4’Shall not all the workers of iniquity know it,
<br>Who eat up My people as they eat bread,
<br>And call not upon the LORD?'
<br>5There are they in great fear;
<br>For God is with the righteous generation.
<br>6Ye would put to shame the counsel of the poor,
<br>But the LORD is his refuge.
<br>7Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion!
<br>When the LORD turneth the captivity of His people,
<br>Let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad.
<br> 
<br>15	A Psalm of David.
<br>LORD, who shall sojourn in Thy
<br>tabernacle?
<br>Who shall dwell upon Thy holy mountain?
<br>2He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness,
<br>And speaketh truth in his heart;
<br>3That hath no slander upon his tongue,
<br>Nor doeth evil to his fellow,
<br>Nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour;
<br>4In whose eyes a vile person is despised,
<br>But he honoureth them that fear the LORD;
<br>He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not;
<br>5He that putteth not out his money on interest,
<br>Nor taketh a bribe against the innocent.
<br>He that doeth these things shall never be moved.
<br>16	Michtam of David.
<br>Keep me, O God; for I have taken
<br>refuge in Thee.
<br>2I have said unto the LORD: 'Thou art my Lord;
<br>I have no good but in Thee';
<br>3As for the holy that are in the earth,
<br>They are the excellent in whom is all my delight.
<br>4Let the idols of them be multiplied that make suit unto another;
<br> 
<br>Their drink-offerings of blood will I not offer,
<br>Nor take their names upon my lips.
<br>5O LORD, the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup,
<br>Thou maintainest my lot.
<br>
<br>6The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places;
<br>Yea, I have a goodly heritage.
<br>7I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel;
<br>Yea, in the night seasons my reins instruct me.
<br>8I have set the LORD always before me;
<br>Surely He is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.
<br>9Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth; my flesh also dwelleth in safety;
<br>10For Thou wilt not abandon my soul to the nether-world;
<br>Neither wilt Thou suffer Thy godly one to see the pit.
<br>11Thou makest me to know the path of life;
<br>In Thy presence is fulness of joy,
<br>In Thy right hand bliss for evermore.
<br>17	A Prayer of David.
<br>Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto
<br>my cry;
<br>Give ear unto my prayer from lips without deceit.
<br>2Let my judgment come forth from Thy presence;
<br> 
<br>Let Thine eyes behold equity.
<br>3Thou hast tried my heart, Thou hast visited it in the night;
<br>Thou hast tested me, and Thou findest not
<br>That I had a thought which should not pass my mouth.
<br>4As for the doings of men, by the word of Thy lips
<br>I have kept me from the ways of the violent.
<br>5My steps have held fast to Thy paths,
<br>My feet have not slipped.
<br>
<br>6As for me, I call upon Thee, for Thou wilt answer me, O God;
<br>Incline Thine ear unto me, hear my speech.
<br>7Make passing great Thy mercies, O Thou that savest by Thy right hand
<br>From assailants them that take refuge in Thee.
<br>8Keep me as the apple of the eye,
<br>Hide me in the shadow of Thy wings,
<br>9From the wicked that oppress,
<br>My deadly enemies, that compass me about.
<br>10Their gross heart they have shut tight,
<br>With their mouth they speak proudly.
<br>11At our every step they have now encompassed us;
<br>They set their eyes to cast us down to the earth.
<br> 
<br>12He is like a lion that is eager to tear in pieces,
<br>And like a young lion lurking in secret places.
<br>
<br>13Arise, O LORD, confront him, cast him down;
<br>Deliver my soul from the wicked, by Thy sword;
<br>14From men, by Thy hand, O LORD,
<br>From men of the world, whose portion is in this life,
<br>And whose belly Thou fillest with Thy treasure;
<br>Who have children in plenty,
<br>And leave their abundance to their babes.
<br>15As for me, I shall behold Thy face in righteousness;
<br>I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with Thy likeness.
<br>
<br>For the Leader. [A Psalm] of David the servant of the LORD,
<br>who spoke unto the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul; 2And he said:
<br>I love thee, O LORD, my strength.
<br>3The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;
<br>My God, my rock, in Him I take refuge;
<br>My shield, and my horn of salvation, my high tower.
<br>4Praised, I cry, is the LORD,
<br>And I am saved from mine enemies.
<br> 
<br>5The cords of Death compassed me,
<br>And the floods of aBelial assailed me.
<br>6The cords of aSheol surrounded me; The snares of Death confronted me. 7In my distress I called upon the
<br>LORD,
<br>And cried unto my God;
<br>Out of His temple He heard my voice,
<br>And my cry came before Him unto His ears.
<br>
<br>8Then the earth did shake and quake,
<br>The foundations also of the mountains did tremble;
<br>They were shaken, because He was wroth.
<br>9Smoke arose up in His nostrils,
<br>And fire out of His mouth did devour;
<br>Coals flamed forth from Him.
<br>10He bowed the heavens also, and came down;
<br>And thick darkness was under His feet.
<br>11And He rode upon a cherub, and did fly;
<br>Yea, He did swoop down upon the wings of the wind.
<br>12He made darkness His hiding- place, His pavilion round about Him;
<br>Darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.
<br>
<br>
<br>a That is, the nether-world.
<br> 
<br>13At the brightness before Him, there passed through His thick clouds
<br>Hailstones and coals of fire.
<br>14The LORD also thundered in the heavens,
<br>And the Most High gave forth His voice;
<br>Hailstones and coals of fire.
<br>15And He sent out His arrows, and scattered them;
<br>And He shot forth lightnings, and discomfited them.
<br>16And the channels of waters appeared,
<br>And the foundations of the world were laid bare,
<br>At Thy rebuke, O LORD,
<br>At the blast of the breath of Thy nostrils.
<br>
<br>17He sent from on high, He took me; He drew me out of many waters.
<br>18He delivered me from mine enemy most strong,
<br>And from them that hated me, for they were too mighty for me.
<br>19They confronted me in the day of my calamity;
<br>But the LORD was a stay unto me.
<br>20He brought me forth also into a large place;
<br>He delivered me, because He delighted in me.
<br>21The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness;
<br>According to the cleanness of my hands hath He recompensed me.
<br> 
<br>22For I have kept the ways of the LORD,
<br>And have not wickedly departed from my God.
<br>23For all His ordinances were before me,
<br>And I put not away His statutes from me.
<br>24And I was single-hearted with Him,
<br>And I kept myself from mine iniquity.
<br>25Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness,
<br>According to the cleanness of my hands in His eyes.
<br>26With the merciful Thou dost show Thyself merciful,
<br>With the upright man Thou dost show Thyself upright;
<br>27With the pure Thou dost show Thyself pure;
<br>And with the crooked Thou dost show Thyself subtle.
<br>28For Thou dost save the afflicted people;
<br>But the haughty eyes Thou dost humble.
<br>
<br>29For Thou dost light my lamp;
<br>The LORD my God doth lighten my darkness.
<br>30For by Thee I run upon a troop; And by my God do I scale a wall. 31As for God, His way is perfect; The word of the LORD is tried;
<br>He is a shield unto all them that take refuge in Him.
<br> 
<br>
<br>32For who is God, save the LORD? And who is a Rock, except our
<br>God?
<br>33The God that girdeth me with strength,
<br>And maketh my way straight;
<br>34Who maketh my feet like hinds',
<br>And setteth me upon my high places;
<br>35Who traineth my hands for war,
<br>So that mine arms do bend a bow of brass.
<br>36Thou hast also given me Thy shield of salvation,
<br>And Thy right hand hath holden me up;
<br>And Thy condescension hath made me great.
<br>37Thou hast enlarged my steps under me,
<br>And my feet have not slipped.
<br>
<br>38I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them;
<br>Neither did I turn back till they were consumed.
<br>39I have smitten them through, so that they are not able to rise;
<br>They are fallen under my feet.
<br>40For Thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle;
<br>Thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.
<br>41Thou hast also made mine enemies turn their backs unto me,
<br>And I did cut off them that hate me.
<br>42They cried, but there was none to save;
<br> 
<br>Even unto the LORD, but He answered them not.
<br>43Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind;
<br>I did cast them out as the mire of the streets.
<br>44Thou hast delivered me from the contentions of the people;
<br>Thou hast made me the head of the nations;
<br>A people whom I have not known serve me.
<br>45As soon as they hear of me, they obey me;
<br>The sons of the stranger dwindle away before me.
<br>46The sons of the stranger fade away,
<br>And come trembling out of their close places.
<br>
<br>47The LORD liveth, and blessed be my Rock;
<br>And exalted be the God of my salvation;
<br>48Even the God that executeth vengeance for me,
<br>And subdueth peoples under me.
<br>49He delivereth me from mine enemies;
<br>Yea, Thou liftest me up above them that rise up against me;
<br>Thou deliverest me from the violent man.
<br>50Therefore I will give thanks unto Thee, O LORD, among the nations,
<br>And will sing praises unto Thy name.
<br> 
<br>51Great salvation giveth He to His king;
<br>And showeth mercy to His anointed,
<br>To David and to his seed, for evermore.
<br>
<br>For the Leader. A Psalm of David.
<br>
<br>2The heavens declare the glory of God,
<br>And the firmament showeth His handiwork;
<br>3Day unto day uttereth speech,
<br>And night unto night revealeth knowledge;
<br>4There is no speech, there are no words,
<br>Neither is their voice heard.
<br>5Their line is gone out through all the earth,
<br>And their words to the end of the world.
<br>In them hath He set a tent for the sun,
<br>6Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber,
<br>And rejoiceth as a strong man to run his course.
<br>7His going forth is from the end of the heaven,
<br>And his circuit unto the ends of it;
<br>And there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.
<br>
<br>8The law of the LORD is perfect, restoring the soul;
<br>The testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.
<br> 
<br>9The precepts of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart;
<br>The commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.
<br>10The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever;
<br>The ordinances of the LORD are true, they are righteous altogether;
<br>11More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold;
<br>Sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.
<br>12Moreover by them is Thy servant warned;
<br>In keeping of them there is great reward.
<br>13Who can discern his errors? Clear Thou me from hidden faults. 14Keep back Thy servant also from
<br>presumptuous sins,
<br>That they may not have dominion over me; then shall I be faultless,
<br>And I shall be clear from great transgression.
<br>15Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable before Thee,
<br>O LORD, my Rock, and my Redeemer.
<br>
<br>For the Leader. A Psalm of David.
<br>
<br>2The LORD answer thee in the day of trouble;
<br>The name of the God of Jacob set thee up on high;
<br>3Send forth thy help from the sanctuary,
<br> 
<br>And support thee out of Zion;
<br>4Receive the memorial of all thy meal-offerings,
<br>And accept the fat of thy burnt- sacrifice;	Selah
<br>5Grant thee according to thine own heart,
<br>And fulfil all thy counsel.
<br>6We will shout for joy in thy victory,
<br>And in the name of our God we will set up our standards;
<br>The LORD fulfil all thy petitions.
<br>
<br>7Now know I that the LORD saveth His anointed;
<br>He will answer him from His holy heaven
<br>With the mighty acts of His saving right hand.
<br>8Some trust in chariots, and some in horses;
<br>But we will make mention of the name of the LORD our God.
<br>9They are bowed down and fallen; But we are risen, and stand upright. 10Save, LORD;
<br>Let the King answer us in the day that we call.
<br>
<br>For the Leader. A Psalm of David.
<br>
<br>2O LORD, in Thy strength the king rejoiceth;
<br>And in Thy salvation how greatly doth he exult!
<br>3Thou hast given him his heart's desire,
<br> 
<br>And the request of his lips Thou hast not withholden.	Selah
<br>4For Thou meetest him with choicest blessings;
<br>Thou settest a crown of fine gold on his head.
<br>5He asked life of Thee, Thou gavest it him;
<br>Even length of days for ever and ever.
<br>6His glory is great through Thy salvation;
<br>Honour and majesty dost Thou lay upon him.
<br>7For Thou makest him most blessed for ever;
<br>Thou makest him glad with joy in Thy presence.
<br>8For the king trusteth in the LORD, Yea, in the mercy of the Most High;
<br>he shall not be moved.
<br>
<br>9Thy hand shall be equal to all thine enemies;
<br>Thy right hand shall overtake those that hate thee.
<br>10Thou shalt make them as a fiery furnace in the time of thine anger;
<br>The LORD shall swallow them up in His wrath,
<br>And the fire shall devour them.
<br>11Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth,
<br>And their seed from among the children of men.
<br>12For they intended evil against thee,
<br>They imagined a device, wherewith they shall not prevail.
<br> 
<br>13For thou shalt make them turn their back,
<br>Thou shalt make ready with thy bowstrings against the face of them.
<br>
<br>14Be Thou exalted, O LORD, in Thy strength;
<br>So will we sing and praise Thy power.
<br>
<br>For the Leader; upon Aijeleth ha-Shahar. A Psalm of David.
<br>
<br>2My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me,
<br>And art far from my help at the words of my cry?
<br>3O my God, I call by day, but Thou answerest not;
<br>And at night, and there is no surcease for me.
<br>4Yet Thou art holy,
<br>O Thou that art enthroned upon the praises of Israel.
<br>5In Thee did our fathers trust;
<br>They trusted, and Thou didst deliver them.
<br>6Unto Thee they cried, and escaped;
<br>In Thee did they trust, and were not ashamed.
<br>7But I am a worm, and no man;
<br>A reproach of men, and despised of the people.
<br>8All they that see me laugh me to scorn;
<br>They shoot out the lip, they shake the head:
<br> 
<br>9'Let him commit himself unto the LORD! let Him rescue him;
<br>Let Him deliver him, seeing He delighteth in him.'
<br>
<br>10For Thou art He that took me out of the womb;
<br>Thou madest me trust when I was upon my mother's breasts.
<br>11Upon Thee I have been cast from my birth;
<br>Thou art my God from my mother's womb.
<br>12Be not far from me; for trouble is near;
<br>For there is none to help.
<br>13Many bulls have encompassed me;
<br>Strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round.
<br>14They open wide their mouth against me,
<br>As a ravening and a roaring lion.
<br>15I am poured out like water,
<br>And all my bones are out of joint; My heart is become like wax;
<br>It is melted in mine inmost parts.
<br>16My strength is dried up like a potsherd;
<br>And my tongue cleaveth to my throat;
<br>And Thou layest me in the dust of death.
<br>17For dogs have encompassed me;
<br>A company of evil-doers have inclosed me;
<br>Like a lion, they are at my hands and my feet.
<br>18I may count all my bones; They look and gloat over me.
<br> 
<br>19They part my garments among them,
<br>And for my vesture do they cast lots.
<br>20But Thou, O LORD, be not far off;
<br>O Thou my strength, hasten to help me.
<br>21Deliver my soul from the sword;
<br>Mine only one from the power of the dog.
<br>22Save me from the lion's mouth; Yea, from the horns of the wild-
<br>oxen do Thou answer me.
<br>
<br>23I will declare Thy name unto my brethren;
<br>In the midst of the congregation will I praise Thee.
<br>24'Ye that fear the LORD, praise Him; All ye the seed of Jacob, glorify
<br>Him;
<br>And stand in awe of Him, all ye the seed of Israel.
<br>25For He hath not despised nor abhorred the lowliness of the poor;
<br>Neither hath He hid His face from him;
<br>But when he cried unto Him, He heard.'
<br>26From Thee cometh my praise in the great congregation;
<br>I will pay my vows before them that fear Him.
<br>27Let the humble eat and be satisfied;
<br>Let them praise the LORD that seek after Him;
<br> 
<br>May your heart be quickened for ever!
<br>28All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn unto the LORD;
<br>And all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before Thee.
<br>29For the kingdom is the LORD’S; And He is the ruler over the nations. 30All the fat ones of the earth shall
<br>eat and worship;
<br>All they that go down to the dust shall kneel before Him,
<br>Even he that cannot keep his soul alive.
<br>31A seed shall serve him;
<br>It shall be told of the Lord unto the next generation.
<br>32They shall come and shall declare His righteousness
<br>Unto a people that shall be born, that He hath done it.
<br>23	A Psalm of David.
<br>The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not
<br>want.
<br>2He maketh me to lie down in green pastures;
<br>He leadeth me beside the still waters.
<br>3He restoreth my soul;
<br>He guideth me in straight paths for His name's sake.
<br>4Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
<br>I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me;
<br>Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me.
<br> 
<br>5Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies;
<br>Thou hast anointed my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
<br>6Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life;
<br>And I shall dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.
<br>24	A Psalm of David.
<br>The earth is the LORD’S, and the
<br>fulness thereof;
<br>The world, and they that dwell therein.
<br>2For He hath founded it upon the seas,
<br>And established it upon the floods.
<br>3Who shall ascend into the mountain of the LORD?
<br>And who shall stand in His holy place?
<br>4He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart;
<br>Who hath not taken My name in vain,
<br>And hath not sworn deceitfully.
<br>5He shall receive a blessing from the LORD,
<br>And righteousness from the God of his salvation.
<br>6Such is the generation of them that seek after Him,
<br>That seek Thy face, even Jacob.
<br>Selah
<br>
<br>7Lift up your heads, O ye gates,
<br>And be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors;
<br> 
<br>That the King of glory may come in.
<br>8'Who is the King of glory?' 'The LORD strong and mighty, The LORD mighty in battle.' 9Lift up your heads, O ye gates,
<br>Yea, lift them up, ye everlasting doors;
<br>That the King of glory may come in. 10'Who then is the King of glory?' 'The LORD of hosts;
<br>He is the King of glory.'	Selah
<br>25	[A Psalm] of David.
<br>א Unto Thee, O LORD, do I lift up my
<br>soul.
<br>ב 2O my God, in Thee have I trusted, let me not be ashamed;
<br>Let not mine enemies triumph over me.
<br>ג 3Yea, none that wait for Thee shall be ashamed;
<br>They shall be ashamed that deal treacherously without cause.
<br>ד 4Show me Thy ways, O LORD; teach me Thy paths.
<br>הו 5Guide me in Thy truth, and teach me;
<br>For Thou art the God of my salvation;
<br>For Thee do I wait all the day. ז 6Remember, O LORD, Thy
<br>compassions and Thy mercies; For they have been from of old.
<br>ח 7Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions;
<br>According to Thy mercy remember Thou me,
<br>For Thy goodness' sake, O LORD.
<br> 
<br>ט 8Good and upright is the LORD;
<br>Therefore doth He instruct sinners in the way.
<br>י 9He guideth The humble in justice;
<br>And He teacheth the humble His way.
<br>כ 10All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth
<br>Unto such as keep His covenant and His testimonies.
<br>ל 11For Thy name's sake, O LORD, Pardon mine iniquity, for it is great.
<br>מ 12What man is he that feareth the LORD?
<br>Him will He instruct in the way that He should choose.
<br>נ 13His soul shall abide in prosperity; And his seed shall inherit the land.
<br>ס 14The counsel of the LORD is with them that fear Him;
<br>And His covenant, to make them know it.
<br>ע 15Mine eyes are ever toward the LORD;
<br>For He will bring forth my feet out of the net.
<br>פ 16Turn Thee unto me, and be gracious unto me;
<br>For I am solitary and afflicted. צ 17The troubles of my heart are
<br>enlarged;
<br>O bring Thou me out of my distresses.
<br>ר 18See mine affliction and my travail; And forgive all my sins.
<br>19Consider how many are mine enemies,
<br>And the cruel hatred wherewith they hate me.
<br> 
<br>ש 20O keep my soul, and deliver me;
<br>Let me not be ashamed, for I have taken refuge in Thee.
<br>ת 21Let integrity and uprightness preserve me,
<br>Because I wait for Thee.
<br>
<br>22Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.
<br>26	[A Psalm] of David.
<br>Judge me, O LORD, for I have
<br>walked in mine integrity,
<br>And I have trusted in the LORD without wavering.
<br>2Examine me, O LORD, and try me; Test my reins and my heart.
<br>3For Thy mercy is before mine eyes; And I have walked in Thy truth.
<br>4I have not sat with men of falsehood;
<br>Neither will I go in with dissemblers.
<br>5I hate the gathering of evil doers, And will not sit with the wicked.
