<br>§3651. Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds and declares that—
<br>
<br>(1) there is a government-to-government relationship between the United States and Indian tribes;
<br>
<br>(2) Indian tribes are sovereign entities and are responsible for exercising governmental authority over Indian lands;
<br>
<br>(3) the rate of violent crime committed in Indian country is approximately twice the rate of violent crime committed in the United States as a whole;
<br>
<br>(4) in any community, a high rate of violent crime is a major obstacle to investment, job creation and economic growth;
<br>
<br>(5) tribal justice systems are an essential part of tribal governments and serve as important forums for ensuring the health and safety and the political integrity of tribal governments;
<br>
<br>(6) Congress and the Federal courts have repeatedly recognized tribal justice systems as the most appropriate forums for the adjudication of disputes affecting personal and property rights on Native lands;
<br>
<br>(7) enhancing tribal court systems and improving access to those systems serves the dual Federal goals of tribal political self-determination and economic self-sufficiency;
<br>
<br>(8) there is both inadequate funding and an inadequate coordinating mechanism to meet the technical and legal assistance needs of tribal justice systems and this lack of adequate technical and legal assistance funding impairs their operation;
<br>
<br>(9) tribal court membership organizations have served a critical role in providing training and technical assistance for development and enhancement of tribal justice systems;
<br>
<br>(10) Indian legal services programs, as funded partially through the Legal Services Corporation, have an established record of providing cost effective legal assistance to Indian people in tribal court forums, and also contribute significantly to the development of tribal courts and tribal jurisprudence; and
<br>
<br>(11) the provision of adequate technical assistance to tribal courts and legal assistance to both individuals and tribal courts is an essential element in the development of strong tribal court systems.

<br>(a) Tribal recognition
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall conduct all land management activities on Indian agricultural land in accordance with goals and objectives set forth in the approved agricultural resource management plan, in an integrated resource management plan, and in accordance with all tribal laws and ordinances, except in specific instances where such compliance would be contrary to the trust responsibility of the United States.
<br>(b) Tribal laws
<br>
<br>Unless otherwise prohibited by Federal law, the Secretary shall comply with tribal laws and ordinances pertaining to Indian agricultural lands, including laws regulating the environment and historic or cultural preservation, and laws or ordinances adopted by the tribal government to regulate land use or other activities under tribal jurisdiction. The Secretary shall—
<br>
<br>(1) provide assistance in the enforcement of such tribal laws;
<br>
<br>(2) provide notice of such laws to persons or entities undertaking activities on Indian agricultural lands; and

<br>(c) Concurrent jurisdiction
<br>
<br>Indian tribes which adopt the regulations promulgated by the Secretary pursuant to subsection (a) shall have concurrent jurisdiction with the United States to enforce the provisions of this section and the regulations promulgated thereunder. The Bureau and other agencies of the Federal Government shall, at the request of the tribal government, defer to tribal prosecutions of Indian agricultural land trespass cases.

<br>(a) Assessment
<br>
<br>Within six months after December 3, 1993, the Secretary, in consultation with affected Indian tribes, shall enter into a contract with a non-Federal entity knowledgeable in agricultural management on Federal and private lands to conduct an independent assessment of Indian agricultural land management and practices.

<br>
<br>(1) to establish a comprehensive assessment of the improvement, funding, and development needs for all Indian agricultural lands;

<br>
<br>(3) to identify any obstacles to Indian access to Federal or private programs relating to agriculture or related rural development programs generally available to the public at large.

<br>
<br>(2) lease or permit agricultural lands to the highest responsible bidder at rates less than the Federal appraisal after satisfactorily advertising such lands for lease, when, in the opinion of the Secretary, such action would be in the best interest of the Indian landowner.
<br>(b) Authority of tribe
<br>
<br>When authorized by an appropriate tribal resolution establishing a general policy for leasing of Indian agricultural lands, the Secretary—
<br>
<br>(1) shall provide a preference to Indian operators in the issuance and renewal of agricultural leases and permits so long as the lessor receives fair market value for his property;

<br>
<br>(3) shall provide for posting of other collateral or security in lieu of surety or other bonds;

<br>
<br>(5) shall approve leases and permits of tribally owned agricultural lands at rates determined by the tribal governing body.
<br>(c) Rights of individual landowners
<br>
<br>(1) Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or altering the authority or right of an individual allottee or Indian tribe in the legal or beneficial use of his, her, or its own land or to enter into an agricultural lease of the surface interest of his, her, or its allotment or land under any other provision of law.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) The owners of a majority interest in any trust or restricted land are authorized to enter into an agricultural lease of the surface interest of a trust or restricted allotment, and such lease shall be binding upon the owners of the minority interests in such land if the terms of the lease provide such minority interests with not less than fair market value for such land.
<br>
<br>(B) For the purposes of subparagraph (A), a majority interest in trust or restricted land is an interest greater than 50 percent of the legal or beneficial title.
<br>
<br>(3) The provisions of subsection (b) shall not apply to a parcel of trust or restricted land if the owners of at least 50 percent of the legal or beneficial interest in such land file with the Secretary a written objection to the application of all or any part of such tribal rules to the leasing of such parcel of land.
