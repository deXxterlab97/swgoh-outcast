<br>§5202. Eisenhower Exchange Fellowship Program Trust Fund
<br>(a) Establishment
<br>
<br>There is established in the Treasury of the United States a trust fund to be known as the Eisenhower Exchange Fellowship Program Trust Fund (hereinafter in this chapter referred to as the "fund"). The fund shall consist of amounts authorized to be appropriated under section 5204 of this title.
<br>(b) Investment in interest-bearing obligations
<br>
<br>It shall be the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury to invest in full amounts appropriated to the fund. Such investments may be made only in interest-bearing obligations of the United States or in obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interests 1 by the United States. For such purpose, such obligations may be acquired (1) on original issue at the issue price, or (2) by purchase of outstanding obligations at the market price. The purposes for which obligations of the United States may be issued under chapter 31 of title 31, are hereby extended to authorize the issuance at par of special obligations exclusively to the fund. Such special obligations shall bear interest at a rate equal to the average rate of interest, computed as to the end of the calendar month next preceding the date of such issue borne by all marketable interest-bearing obligations of the United States then forming a part of the public debt; except that where such average rate is not a multiple of one-eighth of 1 percent, the rate of interest of such special obligations shall be the multiple of one-eighth of 1 percent next lower than such average rate. Such special obligations shall be issued only if the Secretary determines that the purchase of other interest-bearing obligations of the United States, or of obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States or original issue or at the market price, is not in the public interest.
<br>(c) Sale and redemption of obligations
<br>
<br>Any obligation acquired by the fund (except special obligations issued exclusively to the fund) may be sold by the Secretary of the Treasury at the market price, and such special obligations may be redeemed at par plus accrued interest.
<br>(d) Credit to fund of interest and proceeds of sale or redemption
<br>
<br>The interest on, and the proceeds from the sale or redemption of, any obligations held in the fund shall be credited to and form a part of the fund.

<br>§5501. Findings and policy
<br>(a) Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) Threats to human health and environmental quality are increasingly complex, involving a wide range of conventional and toxic contaminants in the air and water and on the land.
<br>
<br>(2) There is growing evidence of international environmental problems, such as global warming, ocean pollution, and declines in species diversity, and that these problems pose serious threats to human health and the environment on a global scale.
<br>
<br>(3) Environmental problems represent as significant a threat to the quality of life and the economic vitality of urban areas as they do the natural balance of rural areas.
<br>
<br>(4) Effective response to complex environmental problems requires understanding of the natural and built environment, awareness of environmental problems and their origins (including those in urban areas), and the skills to solve these problems.
<br>
<br>(5) Development of effective solutions to environmental problems and effective implementation of environmental programs requires a well educated and trained, professional work force.
<br>
<br>(6) Current Federal efforts to inform and educate the public concerning the natural and built environment and environmental problems are not adequate.
<br>
<br>(7) Existing Federal support for development and training of professionals in environmental fields is not sufficient.
<br>
<br>(8) The Federal Government, acting through the Environmental Protection Agency, should work with local education institutions, State education agencies, not-for-profit educational and environmental organizations, noncommercial educational broadcasting entities, and private sector interests to support development of curricula, special projects, and other activities, to increase understanding of the natural and built environment and to improve awareness of environmental problems.
<br>
<br>(9) The Federal Government, acting through the coordinated efforts of its agencies and with the leadership of the Environmental Protection Agency, should work with local education institutions, State education agencies, not-for-profit educational and environmental organizations, noncommercial educational broadcasting entities, and private sector interests to develop programs to provide increased emphasis and financial resources for the purpose of attracting students into environmental engineering and assisting them in pursuing the programs to complete the advanced technical education required to provide effective problem solving capabilities for complex environmental issues.
<br>
<br>(10) Federal natural resource agencies such as the United States Forest Service have a wide range of environmental expertise and a long history of cooperation with educational institutions and technology transfer that can assist in furthering the purposes of the 1 chapter.
<br>(b) Policy
<br>
<br>It is the policy of the United States to establish and support a program of education on the environment, for students and personnel working with students, through activities in schools, institutions of higher education, and related educational activities, and to encourage postsecondary students to pursue careers related to the environment.
