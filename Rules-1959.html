<br>§4712. Enhancement of contractor protection from reprisal for disclosure of certain information
<br>
<br>(a) Prohibition of Reprisals.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—An employee of a contractor, subcontractor, grantee, or subgrantee or personal services contractor may not be discharged, demoted, or otherwise discriminated against as a reprisal for disclosing to a person or body described in paragraph (2) information that the employee reasonably believes is evidence of gross mismanagement of a Federal contract or grant, a gross waste of Federal funds, an abuse of authority relating to a Federal contract or grant, a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety, or a violation of law, rule, or regulation related to a Federal contract (including the competition for or negotiation of a contract) or grant.
<br>
<br>(2) Persons and bodies covered.—The persons and bodies described in this paragraph are the persons and bodies as follows:
<br>
<br>(A) A Member of Congress or a representative of a committee of Congress.

<br>(F) A court or grand jury.
<br>
<br>(G) A management official or other employee of the contractor, subcontractor, grantee, or subgrantee who has the responsibility to investigate, discover, or address misconduct.
<br>
<br>(3) Rules of construction.—For the purposes of paragraph (1)—
<br>
<br>(A) an employee who initiates or provides evidence of contractor, subcontractor, grantee, or subgrantee misconduct in any judicial or administrative proceeding relating to waste, fraud, or abuse on a Federal contract or grant shall be deemed to have made a disclosure covered by such paragraph; and
<br>
<br>(B) a reprisal described in paragraph (1) is prohibited even if it is undertaken at the request of an executive branch official, unless the request takes the form of a non-discretionary directive and is within the authority of the executive branch official making the request.
<br>
<br>(b) Investigation of Complaints.—
<br>
<br>(1) Submission of complaint.—A person who believes that the person has been subjected to a reprisal prohibited by subsection (a) may submit a complaint to the Inspector General of the executive agency involved. Unless the Inspector General determines that the complaint is frivolous, fails to allege a violation of the prohibition in subsection (a), or has previously been addressed in another Federal or State judicial or administrative proceeding initiated by the complainant, the Inspector General shall investigate the complaint and, upon completion of such investigation, submit a report of the findings of the investigation to the person, the contractor, subcontractor, grantee, or subgrantee concerned, and the head of the agency.
<br>
<br>(2) Inspector general action.—
<br>
<br>(A) Determination or submission of report on findings.—Except as provided under subparagraph (B), the Inspector General shall make a determination that a complaint is frivolous, fails to allege a violation of the prohibition in subsection (a), or has previously been addressed in another Federal or State judicial or administrative proceeding initiated by the complainant or submit a report under paragraph (1) within 180 days after receiving the complaint.
<br>
<br>(B) Extension of time.—If the Inspector General is unable to complete an investigation in time to submit a report within the 180-day period specified in subparagraph (A) and the person submitting the complaint agrees to an extension of time, the Inspector General shall submit a report under paragraph (1) within such additional period of time, up to 180 days, as shall be agreed upon between the Inspector General and the person submitting the complaint.
<br>
<br>(3) Prohibition on disclosure.—The Inspector General may not respond to any inquiry or disclose any information from or about any person alleging the reprisal, except to the extent that such response or disclosure is—
<br>
<br>(A) made with the consent of the person alleging the reprisal;
<br>
<br>(B) made in accordance with the provisions of section 552a of title 5 or as required by any other applicable Federal law; or
<br>
<br>(C) necessary to conduct an investigation of the alleged reprisal.
<br>
<br>(4) Time limitation.—A complaint may not be brought under this subsection more than three years after the date on which the alleged reprisal took place.
<br>
<br>(c) Remedy and Enforcement Authority.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—Not later than 30 days after receiving an Inspector General report pursuant to subsection (b), the head of the executive agency concerned shall determine whether there is sufficient basis to conclude that the contractor, subcontractor, grantee, or subgrantee concerned has subjected the complainant to a reprisal prohibited by subsection (a) and shall either issue an order denying relief or shall take one or more of the following actions:
<br>
<br>(A) Order the contractor, subcontractor, grantee, or subgrantee to take affirmative action to abate the reprisal.
<br>
<br>(B) Order the contractor, subcontractor, grantee, or subgrantee to reinstate the person to the position that the person held before the reprisal, together with compensatory damages (including back pay), employment benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment that would apply to the person in that position if the reprisal had not been taken.
<br>
<br>(C) Order the contractor, subcontractor, grantee, or subgrantee to pay the complainant an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and expert witnesses' fees) that were reasonably incurred by the complainant for, or in connection with, bringing the complaint regarding the reprisal, as determined by the head of the executive agency.
<br>
<br>(2) Exhaustion of remedies.—If the head of an executive agency issues an order denying relief under paragraph (1) or has not issued an order within 210 days after the submission of a complaint under subsection (b), or in the case of an extension of time under paragraph (b)(2)(B), not later than 30 days after the expiration of the extension of time, and there is no showing that such delay is due to the bad faith of the complainant, the complainant shall be deemed to have exhausted all administrative remedies with respect to the complaint, and the complainant may bring a de novo action at law or equity against the contractor, subcontractor, grantee, or subgrantee to seek compensatory damages and other relief available under this section in the appropriate district court of the United States, which shall have jurisdiction over such an action without regard to the amount in controversy. Such an action shall, at the request of either party to the action, be tried by the court with a jury. An action under this paragraph may not be brought more than two years after the date on which remedies are deemed to have been exhausted.
<br>
<br>(3) Admissibility of evidence.—An Inspector General determination and an agency head order denying relief under paragraph (2) shall be admissible in evidence in any de novo action at law or equity brought pursuant to this subsection.
<br>
<br>(4) Enforcement of orders.—Whenever a person fails to comply with an order issued under paragraph (1), the head of the executive agency concerned shall file an action for enforcement of such order in the United States district court for a district in which the reprisal was found to have occurred. In any action brought under this paragraph, the court may grant appropriate relief, including injunctive relief, compensatory and exemplary damages, and attorney fees and costs. The person upon whose behalf an order was issued may also file such an action or join in an action filed by the head of the executive agency.
<br>
<br>(5) Judicial review.—Any person adversely affected or aggrieved by an order issued under paragraph (1) may obtain review of the order's conformance with this subsection, and any regulations issued to carry out this section, in the United States court of appeals for a circuit in which the reprisal is alleged in the order to have occurred. No petition seeking such review may be filed more than 60 days after issuance of the order by the head of the executive agency. Review shall conform to chapter 7 of title 5. Filing such an appeal shall not act to stay the enforcement of the order of the head of an executive agency, unless a stay is specifically entered by the court.
<br>
<br>(6) Burdens of proof.—The legal burdens of proof specified in section 1221(e) of title 5 shall be controlling for the purposes of any investigation conducted by an Inspector General, decision by the head of an executive agency, or judicial or administrative proceeding to determine whether discrimination prohibited under this section has occurred.
<br>
<br>(7) Rights and remedies not waivable.—The rights and remedies provided for in this section may not be waived by any agreement, policy, form, or condition of employment.
<br>
<br>(d) Notification of Employees.—The head of each executive agency shall ensure that contractors, subcontractors, grantees, and subgrantees of the agency inform their employees in writing of the rights and remedies provided under this section, in the predominant native language of the workforce.
<br>
<br>(e) Construction.—Nothing in this section may be construed to authorize the discharge of, demotion of, or discrimination against an employee for a disclosure other than a disclosure protected by subsection (a) or to modify or derogate from a right or remedy otherwise available to the employee.
<br>
<br>(f) Exceptions.—(1) This section shall not apply to any element of the intelligence community, as defined in section 3(4) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 401a(4)).
<br>
<br>(2) This section shall not apply to any disclosure made by an employee of a contractor, subcontractor, grantee, or subgrantee of an element of the intelligence community if such disclosure—
<br>
<br>(A) relates to an activity of an element of the intelligence community; or
<br>
<br>(B) was discovered during contract, subcontract, grantee, or subgrantee services provided to an element of the intelligence community.
<br>
<br>(g) Definitions.—In this section:
<br>
<br>(1) The term "abuse of authority" means an arbitrary and capricious exercise of authority that is inconsistent with the mission of the executive agency concerned or the successful performance of a contract or grant of such agency.
<br>
<br>(2) The term "Inspector General" means an Inspector General appointed under the Inspector General Act of 1978 and any Inspector General that receives funding from, or has oversight over contracts or grants awarded for or on behalf of, the executive agency concerned.
<br>
<br>(h) Construction.—Nothing in this section, or the amendments made by this section,1 shall be construed to provide any rights to disclose classified information not otherwise provided by law.

<br>
<br>(a) Authority.—Subject to subsection (b), the head of an executive agency may carry out a covered procurement action.
<br>
<br>(b) Determination and Notification.—Except as authorized by subsection (c) to address an urgent national security interest, the head of an executive agency may exercise the authority provided in subsection (a) only after—
<br>
<br>(1) obtaining a joint recommendation, in unclassified or classified form, from the chief acquisition officer and the chief information officer of the agency, or officials performing similar functions in the case of executive agencies that do not have such officials, which includes a review of any risk assessment made available by the executive agency identified under section 1323(a)(3) of this title, that there is a significant supply chain risk in a covered procurement;
<br>
<br>(2) providing notice of the joint recommendation described in paragraph (1) to any source named in the joint recommendation advising—
<br>
<br>(A) that a recommendation is being considered or has been obtained;
<br>
<br>(B) to the extent consistent with the national security and law enforcement interests, of information that forms the basis for the recommendation;
<br>
<br>(C) that, within 30 days after receipt of the notice, the source may submit information and argument in opposition to the recommendation; and
<br>
<br>(D) of the procedures governing the consideration of the submission and the possible exercise of the authority provided in subsection (a);
<br>
<br>(3) making a determination in writing, in unclassified or classified form, after considering any information submitted by a source under paragraph (2) and in consultation with the chief information security officer of the agency, that—
<br>
<br>(A) use of the authority under subsection (a) is necessary to protect national security by reducing supply chain risk;
<br>
<br>(B) less intrusive measures are not reasonably available to reduce such supply chain risk; and
<br>
<br>(C) the use of such authorities will apply to a single covered procurement or a class of covered procurements, and otherwise specifies the scope of the determination; and
<br>
<br>(4) providing a classified or unclassified notice of the determination made under paragraph (3) to the appropriate congressional committees and leadership that includes—
<br>
<br>(A) the joint recommendation described in paragraph (1);
<br>
<br>(B) a summary of any risk assessment reviewed in support of the joint recommendation required by paragraph (1); and
<br>
<br>(C) a summary of the basis for the determination, including a discussion of less intrusive measures that were considered and why such measures were not reasonably available to reduce supply chain risk.
<br>
<br>(c) Procedures To Address Urgent National Security Interests.—In any case in which the head of an executive agency determines that an urgent national security interest requires the immediate exercise of the authority provided in subsection (a), the head of the agency—
<br>
<br>(1) may, to the extent necessary to address such national security interest, and subject to the conditions in paragraph (2)—
<br>
<br>(A) temporarily delay the notice required by subsection (b)(2);
<br>
<br>(B) make the determination required by subsection (b)(3), regardless of whether the notice required by subsection (b)(2) has been provided or whether the notified source has submitted any information in response to such notice;
<br>
<br>(C) temporarily delay the notice required by subsection (b)(4); and
<br>
<br>(D) exercise the authority provided in subsection (a) in accordance with such determination within 60 calendar days after the day the determination is made; and
<br>
<br>(2) shall take actions necessary to comply with all requirements of subsection (b) as soon as practicable after addressing the urgent national security interest, including—
<br>
<br>(A) providing the notice required by subsection (b)(2);
<br>
<br>(B) promptly considering any information submitted by the source in response to such notice, and making any appropriate modifications to the determination based on such information;
<br>
<br>(C) providing the notice required by subsection (b)(4), including a description of the urgent national security interest, and any modifications to the determination made in accordance with subparagraph (B); and
<br>
<br>(D) providing notice to the appropriate congressional committees and leadership within 7 calendar days of the covered procurement actions taken under this section.

<br>
<br>In subsection (a), before paragraph (1), the words "In this section" are substituted for "as used in this Act" as the probable intent of Congress. Section 9(a) of the Act of August 2, 1946 (ch. 744, 60 Stat. 809) restated 41:5 generally and section 9(c) of the Act, an independent provision, was editorially added as the last paragraph of 41:5. The definitions which apply to "as used in this Act" are probably intended to apply also to 41:5 as restated by the Act. The definitions for "department" and "continental United States" are omitted because those terms do not appear in 41:5. In paragraph (1), the words "section 9104 of title 31" are substituted for "section 104 of the Government Corporation Control Act, approved December 6, 1945" because of section 4(b) of Public Law. 97–258 (31 U.S.C. note prec. 101). In paragraphs (1) and (2), the word "includes" is substituted for "shall be construed to include" and for "shall be construed as including", respectively, to eliminate unnecessary words.
<br>
<br>In subsection (c), the words "as authorized by section 29 of the Surplus Property Act of 1944 (50 U.S.C. App. 1638)" in section 3709 of the Revised Statutes are omitted because section 29 was repealed by section 602(a)(1) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (ch. 288, 63 Stat. 399).

<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13658. Establishing a Minimum Wage for Contractors
<br>
<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13658, Feb. 12, 2014, 79 F.R. 9851, as amended by Ex. Ord. 13838, §2, May 25, 2018, 83 F.R. 25341, provided:
<br>
<br>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act [of 1949], 40 U.S.C. 101 et seq., and in order to promote economy and efficiency in procurement by contracting with sources who adequately compensate their workers, it is hereby ordered as follows:
<br>
<br>Section 1. Policy. This order seeks to increase efficiency and cost savings in the work performed by parties who contract with the Federal Government by increasing to $10.10 the hourly minimum wage paid by those contractors. Raising the pay of low-wage workers increases their morale and the productivity and quality of their work, lowers turnover and its accompanying costs, and reduces supervisory costs. These savings and quality improvements will lead to improved economy and efficiency in Government procurement.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. Establishing a minimum wage for Federal contractors and subcontractors. (a) Executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall, to the extent permitted by law, ensure that new contracts, contract-like instruments, and solicitations (collectively referred to as "contracts"), as described in section 7 of this order, include a clause, which the contractor and any subcontractors shall incorporate into lower-tier subcontracts, specifying, as a condition of payment, that the minimum wage to be paid to workers, including workers whose wages are calculated pursuant to special certificates issued under 29 U.S.C. 214(c), in the performance of the contract or any subcontract thereunder, shall be at least:
<br>
<br>(i) $10.10 per hour beginning January 1, 2015; and
<br>
<br>(ii) beginning January 1, 2016, and annually thereafter, an amount determined by the Secretary of Labor (Secretary). The amount shall be published by the Secretary at least 90 days before such new minimum wage is to take effect and shall be:
<br>
<br>(A) not less than the amount in effect on the date of such determination;
<br>
<br>(B) increased from such amount by the annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (United States city average, all items, not seasonally adjusted), or its successor publication, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics; and
<br>
<br>(C) rounded to the nearest multiple of $0.05.
<br>
<br>(b) In calculating the annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for purposes of subsection (a)(ii)(B) of this section, the Secretary shall compare such Consumer Price Index for the most recent month, quarter, or year available (as selected by the Secretary prior to the first year for which a minimum wage is in effect pursuant to subsection (a)(ii)(B)) with the Consumer Price Index for the same month in the preceding year, the same quarter in the preceding year, or the preceding year, respectively.
<br>
<br>(c) Nothing in this order shall excuse noncompliance with any applicable Federal or State prevailing wage law, or any applicable law or municipal ordinance establishing a minimum wage higher than the minimum wage established under this order.
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. Application to tipped workers. (a) For workers covered by section 2 of this order who are tipped employees pursuant to 29 U.S.C. 203(t), the hourly cash wage that must be paid by an employer to such workers shall be at least:
<br>
<br>(i) $4.90 an hour, beginning on January 1, 2015;
<br>
<br>(ii) for each succeeding 1-year period until the hourly cash wage under this section equals 70 percent of the wage in effect under section 2 of this order for such period, an hourly cash wage equal to the amount determined under this section for the preceding year, increased by the lesser of:
<br>
<br>(A) $0.95; or
<br>
<br>(B) the amount necessary for the hourly cash wage under this section to equal 70 percent of the wage under section 2 of this order; and
<br>
<br>(iii) for each subsequent year, 70 percent of the wage in effect under section 2 for such year rounded to the nearest multiple of $0.05.
<br>
<br>(b) Where workers do not receive a sufficient additional amount on account of tips, when combined with the hourly cash wage paid by the employer, such that their wages are equal to the minimum wage under section 2 of this order, the cash wage paid by the employer, as set forth in this section for those workers, shall be increased such that their wages equal the minimum wage under section 2 of this order. Consistent with applicable law, if the wage required to be paid under the Service Contract Act [of 1965], 41 U.S.C. 6701 et seq., or any other applicable law or regulation is higher than the wage required by section 2, the employer shall pay additional cash wages sufficient to meet the highest wage required to be paid.
<br>
<br>Sec. 4. Regulations and Implementation. (a) The Secretary shall issue regulations by October 1, 2014, to the extent permitted by law and consistent with the requirements of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, to implement the requirements of this order, including providing exclusions from the requirements set forth in this order where appropriate. To the extent permitted by law, within 60 days of the Secretary issuing such regulations, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council shall issue regulations in the Federal Acquisition Regulation to provide for inclusion of the contract clause in Federal procurement solicitations and contracts subject to this order.
<br>
<br>(b) Within 60 days of the Secretary issuing regulations pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, agencies shall take steps, to the extent permitted by law, to exercise any applicable authority to ensure that contracts as described in section 7(d)(i)(C) and (D) of this order, entered into after January 1, 2015, consistent with the effective date of such agency action, comply with the requirements set forth in sections 2 and 3 of this order.
<br>
<br>(c) Any regulations issued pursuant to this section should, to the extent practicable and consistent with section 8 of this order, incorporate existing definitions, procedures, remedies, and enforcement processes under the Fair Labor Standards Act [of 1938], 29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.; the Service Contract Act, 41 U.S.C. 6701 et seq.; and the Davis-Bacon Act, 40 U.S.C. 3141 et seq.
<br>
<br>Sec. 5. Enforcement. (a) The Secretary shall have the authority for investigating potential violations of and obtaining compliance with this order.
<br>
<br>(b) This order creates no rights under the Contract Disputes Act [of 1978], and disputes regarding whether a contractor has paid the wages prescribed by this order, to the extent permitted by law, shall be disposed of only as provided by the Secretary in regulations issued pursuant to this order.
<br>
<br>Sec. 6. Severability. If any provision of this order, or applying such provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of the provisions of such to any person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
<br>
<br>Sec. 7. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
<br>
<br>(i) the authority granted by law to an agency or the head thereof; or
<br>
<br>(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
<br>
<br>(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
<br>
<br>(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
<br>
<br>(d) This order shall apply only to a new contract or contract-like instrument, as defined by the Secretary in the regulations issued pursuant to section 4(a) of this order, if:
<br>
<br>(i)(A) it is a procurement contract for services or construction;
<br>
<br>(B) it is a contract or contract-like instrument for services covered by the Service Contract Act;
<br>
<br>(C) it is a contract or contract-like instrument for concessions, including any concessions contract excluded by Department of Labor regulations at 29 C.F.R. 4.133(b); or
<br>
<br>(D) it is a contract or contract-like instrument entered into with the Federal Government in connection with Federal property or lands and related to offering services for Federal employees, their dependents, or the general public; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the wages of workers under such contract or contract-like instrument are governed by the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Service Contract Act, or the Davis-Bacon Act.
<br>
<br>(e) For contracts or contract-like instruments covered by the Service Contract Act or the Davis-Bacon Act, this order shall apply only to contracts or contract-like instruments at the thresholds specified in those statutes. For procurement contracts where workers' wages are governed by the Fair Labor Standards Act, this order shall apply only to contracts or contract-like instruments that exceed the micro-purchase threshold, as defined in 41 U.S.C. 1902(a), unless expressly made subject to this order pursuant to regulations or actions taken under section 4 of this order.
<br>
<br>(f) This order shall not apply to grants; contracts and agreements with and grants to Indian Tribes under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (Public Law 93–638), as amended; or any contracts or contract-like instruments expressly excluded by the regulations issued pursuant to section 4(a) of this order. This order shall not apply to contracts or contract-like instruments entered into with the Federal Government in connection with seasonal recreational services or seasonal recreational equipment rental for the general public on Federal lands, but this exemption shall not apply to lodging and food services associated with seasonal recreational services. Seasonal recreational services include river running, hunting, fishing, horseback riding, camping, mountaineering activities, recreational ski services, and youth camps.
<br>
<br>(g) Independent agencies are strongly encouraged to comply with the requirements of this order.
<br>
<br>Sec. 8. Effective Date. (a) This order is effective immediately and shall apply to covered contracts where the solicitation for such contract has been issued on or after:
<br>
<br>(i) January 1, 2015, consistent with the effective date for the action taken by the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council pursuant to section 4(a) of this order; or
<br>
<br>(ii) for contracts where an agency action is taken pursuant to section 4(b) of this order, January 1, 2015, consistent with the effective date for such action.
<br>
<br>(b) This order shall not apply to contracts or contract-like instruments entered into pursuant to solicitations issued on or before the effective date for the relevant action taken pursuant to section 4 of this order.
<br>
<br>(c) For all new contracts and contract-like instruments negotiated between the date of this order and the effective dates set forth in this section, agencies are strongly encouraged to take all steps that are reasonable and legally permissible to ensure that individuals working pursuant to those contracts and contract-like instruments are paid an hourly wage of at least $10.10 (as set forth under sections 2 and 3 of this order) as of the effective dates set forth in this section.
<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13706. Establishing Paid Sick Leave for Federal Contractors
<br>
<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13706, Sept. 7, 2015, 80 F.R. 54697, provided:
<br>
<br>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including 40 U.S.C. 121, and in order to promote economy and efficiency in procurement by contracting with sources that allow their employees to earn paid sick leave, it is hereby ordered as follows:
<br>
<br>Section 1. Policy. This order seeks to increase efficiency and cost savings in the work performed by parties that contract with the Federal Government by ensuring that employees on those contracts can earn up to 7 days or more of paid sick leave annually, including paid leave allowing for family care. Providing access to paid sick leave will improve the health and performance of employees of Federal contractors and bring benefits packages at Federal contractors in line with model employers, ensuring that they remain competitive employers in the search for dedicated and talented employees. These savings and quality improvements will lead to improved economy and efficiency in Government procurement.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. Establishing paid sick leave for Federal contractors and subcontractors. (a) Executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall, to the extent permitted by law, ensure that new contracts, contract-like instruments, and solicitations (collectively referred to as "contracts"), as described in section 6 of this order, include a clause, which the contractor and any subcontractors shall incorporate into lower-tier subcontracts, specifying, as a condition of payment, that all employees, in the performance of the contract or any subcontract thereunder, shall earn not less than 1 hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked.
<br>
<br>(b) A contractor may not set a limit on the total accrual of paid sick leave per year, or at any point in time, at less than 56 hours.
<br>
<br>(c) Paid sick leave earned under this order may be used by an employee for an absence resulting from:
<br>
<br>(i) physical or mental illness, injury, or medical condition;
<br>
<br>(ii) obtaining diagnosis, care, or preventive care from a health care provider;
<br>
<br>(iii) caring for a child, a parent, a spouse, a domestic partner, or any other individual related by blood or affinity whose close association with the employee is the equivalent of a family relationship who has any of the conditions or needs for diagnosis, care, or preventive care described in paragraphs (i) or (ii) of this subsection or is otherwise in need of care; or
<br>
<br>(iv) domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking, if the time absent from work is for the purposes otherwise described in paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this subsection, to obtain additional counseling, to seek relocation, to seek assistance from a victim services organization, to take related legal action, including preparation for or participation in any related civil or criminal legal proceeding, or to assist an individual related to the employee as described in paragraph (iii) of this subsection in engaging in any of these activities.
<br>
<br>(d) Paid sick leave accrued under this order shall carry over from 1 year to the next and shall be reinstated for employees rehired by a covered contractor within 12 months after a job separation.
<br>
<br>(e) The use of paid sick leave cannot be made contingent on the requesting employee finding a replacement to cover any work time to be missed.
<br>
<br>(f) The paid sick leave required by this order is in addition to a contractor's obligations under 41 U.S.C. chapter 67 (Service Contract Act [of 1965]) and 40 U.S.C. chapter 31, subchapter IV (Davis-Bacon Act), and contractors may not receive credit toward their prevailing wage or fringe benefit obligations under those Acts for any paid sick leave provided in satisfaction of the requirements of this order.
<br>
<br>(g) A contractor's existing paid leave policy provided in addition to the fulfillment of Service Contract Act or Davis-Bacon Act obligations, if applicable, and made available to all covered employees will satisfy the requirements of this order if the amount of paid leave is sufficient to meet the requirements of this section and if it may be used for the same purposes and under the same conditions described herein.
<br>
<br>(h) Paid sick leave shall be provided upon the oral or written request of an employee that includes the expected duration of the leave, and is made at least 7 calendar days in advance where the need for the leave is foreseeable, and in other cases as soon as is practicable.
<br>
<br>(i) Certification.
<br>
<br>(i) A contractor may only require certification issued by a health care provider for paid sick leave used for the purposes listed in subsections (c)(i), (c)(ii), or (c)(iii) of this section for employee absences of 3 or more consecutive workdays, to be provided no later than 30 days from the first day of the leave.
<br>
<br>(ii) If 3 or more consecutive days of paid sick leave is used for the purposes listed in subsection (c)(iv) of this section, documentation may be required to be provided from an appropriate individual or organization with the minimum necessary information establishing a need for the employee to be absent from work. The contractor shall not disclose any verification information and shall maintain confidentiality about the domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking, unless the employee consents or when disclosure is required by law.
<br>
<br>(j) Nothing in this order shall require a covered contractor to make a financial payment to an employee upon a separation from employment for accrued sick leave that has not been used, but unused leave is subject to reinstatement as prescribed in subsection (d) of this section.
<br>
<br>(k) A covered contractor may not interfere with or in any other manner discriminate against an employee for taking, or attempting to take, paid sick leave as provided for under this order or in any manner asserting, or assisting any other employee in asserting, any right or claim related to this order.
<br>
<br>(l) Nothing in this order shall excuse noncompliance with or supersede any applicable Federal or State law, any applicable law or municipal ordinance, or a collective bargaining agreement requiring greater paid sick leave or leave rights than those established under this order.
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. Regulations and Implementation. (a) The Secretary of Labor (Secretary) shall issue such regulations by September 30, 2016, as are deemed necessary and appropriate to carry out this order, to the extent permitted by law and consistent with the requirements of 40 U.S.C. 121, including providing exclusions from the requirements set forth in this order where appropriate; defining terms used in this order; and requiring contractors to make, keep, and preserve such employee records as the Secretary deems necessary and appropriate for the enforcement of the provisions of this order or the regulations thereunder. To the extent permitted by law, within 60 days of the Secretary issuing such regulations, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council shall issue regulations in the Federal Acquisition Regulation to provide for inclusion in Federal procurement solicitations and contracts subject to this order the contract clause described in section 2(a) of this order.
<br>
<br>(b) Within 60 days of the Secretary issuing regulations pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, agencies shall take steps, to the extent permitted by law, to exercise any applicable authority to ensure that contracts as described in section 6(d)(i)(C) and (D) of this order, entered into after January 1, 2017, consistent with the effective date of such agency action, comply with the requirements set forth in section 2 of this order.
<br>
<br>(c) Any regulations issued pursuant to this section should, to the extent practicable and consistent with section 7 of this order, incorporate existing definitions, procedures, remedies, and enforcement processes under the Fair Labor Standards Act [of 1938], 29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.; the Service Contract Act; the Davis-Bacon Act; the Family and Medical Leave Act [of 1993], 29 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.; the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, 42 U.S.C. 13925 et seq. [now 34 U.S.C. 12291 et seq.]; and Executive Order 13658 of February 12, 2014, Establishing a Minimum Wage for Contractors.
<br>
<br>Sec. 4. Enforcement. (a) The Secretary shall have the authority for investigating potential violations of and obtaining compliance with this order, including the prohibitions on interference and discrimination in section 2(k) of this order.
<br>
<br>(b) This order creates no rights under the Contract Disputes Act [of 1978], and disputes regarding whether a contractor has provided employees with paid sick leave prescribed by this order, to the extent permitted by law, shall be disposed of only as provided by the Secretary in regulations issued pursuant to this order.
<br>
<br>Sec. 5. Severability. If any provision of this order, or applying such provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of the provisions of such to any person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
<br>
<br>Sec. 6. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
<br>

<br>(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
<br>
<br>(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
<br>
<br>(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
<br>
<br>(d) This order shall apply only to a new contract or contract-like instrument, as defined by the Secretary in the regulations issued pursuant to section 3(a) of this order, if:
<br>
<br>(i)(A) it is a procurement contract for services or construction;
<br>
<br>(B) it is a contract or contract-like instrument for services covered by the Service Contract Act;

<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13838. Exemption From Executive Order 13658 for Recreational Services on Federal Lands
<br>
<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13838, May 25, 2018, 83 F.R. 25341, provided:
<br>
<br>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act [of 1949], 40 U.S.C. 101 et seq., and in order to ensure that the Federal Government can economically and efficiently provide the services that allow visitors of all means to enjoy the natural beauty of Federal parks and other Federal lands, it is hereby ordered as follows:
<br>
<br>Section 1. Policy. Executive Order 13658 of February 12, 2014 (Establishing a Minimum Wage for Contractors) [set out above], established a minimum wage to be paid by parties who contract with the Federal Government and applies to outfitters and guides operating on Federal lands. These individuals often conduct multiday recreational tours through Federal lands, and may be required to work substantial overtime hours. The implementation of Executive Order 13658 threatens to raise significantly the cost of guided hikes and tours on Federal lands, preventing many visitors from enjoying the great beauty of America's outdoors. Seasonal recreational workers have irregular work schedules, a high incidence of overtime pay, and an unusually high turnover rate, among other distinguishing characteristics. As a consequence, a minimum wage increase would generally entail large negative effects on hours worked by recreational service workers. Thus, applying Executive Order 13658 to these service contracts does not promote economy and efficiency in making these services available to those who seek to enjoy our Federal lands. That rationale, however, does not apply with the same force to lodging and food services associated with seasonal recreational services, which generally involve more regular work schedules and normal amounts of overtime work. Executive Order 13658 therefore should continue to apply to lodging and food services associated with seasonal recreational services.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. Exemption from Executive Order 13658. [Amended Ex. Ord. No. 13658, set out above.]
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. Agency Implementation. Executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall promptly take appropriate action to implement this exemption and to ensure that all applicable regulations and agency guidance are consistent with this order. Agencies shall modify existing authorizations and solicitations for contracts or contract-like instruments affected by section 2 of this order by removing clauses requiring compliance with Executive Order 13658 (including the contract clause set forth at title 29, part 10, appendix A, Code of Federal Regulations) as soon as practicable and consistent with applicable law. Agencies shall remove such clauses without impairing the recreational activities or uses authorized by those permits and contracts.
<br>
<br>Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
<br>
<br>(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or
<br>
<br>(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
<br>
<br>(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
<br>
<br>(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

<br>§6305. Prohibition on transfer of contract and certain allowable assignments
<br>
<br>(a) General Prohibition on Transfer of Contracts.—The party to whom the Federal Government gives a contract or order may not transfer the contract or order, or any interest in the contract or order, to another party. A purported transfer in violation of this subsection annuls the contract or order so far as the Federal Government is concerned, except that all rights of action for breach of contract are reserved to the Federal Government.
<br>
<br>(b) Assignment.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—Notwithstanding subsection (a) and in accordance with the requirements of this subsection, amounts due from the Federal Government under a contract may be assigned to a bank, trust company, Federal lending agency, or other financing institution.
<br>
<br>(2) Minimum amount.—This subsection applies only to a contract under which the aggregate amounts due from the Federal Government total at least $1,000.
<br>
<br>(3) Accord with contract terms.—Assignment may not be made under this subsection if the contract forbids the assignment.
<br>
<br>(4) Full balance due.—Unless otherwise expressly permitted by the contract, an assignment under this subsection must cover the balance of all amounts due from the Federal Government under the contract.
<br>
<br>(5) Single assignment.—Unless otherwise expressly permitted by the contract, an assignment under this subsection may not be made to more than one party or be subject to further assignment, except that assignment may be made to one party as agent or trustee for 2 or more parties participating in the financing.
<br>
<br>(6) Written notice.—The assignee of an assignment under this subsection shall file written notice of the assignment and a true copy of the instrument of assignment with—
<br>
<br>(A) the contracting officer or head of the officer's department or agency;
<br>
<br>(B) the surety on any bond connected with the contract; and
<br>
<br>(C) the disbursing officer, if any, designated in the contract to make payment.
<br>
<br>(7) Validity.—Notwithstanding any law to the contrary governing the validity of assignments, an assignment under this subsection is a valid assignment for all purposes.
<br>
<br>(8) No refund to cover assignor's liability.—The assignee of an assignment under this subsection is not liable to make any refund to the Federal Government because of an assignor's liability to the Federal Government, whether that liability arises from the contract or independently.
<br>
<br>(9) Avoiding reduction or setoff with certain contracts.—
<br>
<br>(A) Contract provision.—A contract of the Department of Defense, the General Services Administration, the Department of Energy, or another department or agency of the Federal Government designated by the President may, on a determination of need by the President, provide or be amended without consideration to provide that payments made to an assignee under the contract are not subject to reduction or setoff. Each determination of need by the President under this subparagraph shall be published in the Federal Register.
<br>
<br>(B) Carrying out contract provision.—When a "no reduction or setoff" provision as described in subparagraph (A) is included in a contract, payments to the assignee are not subject to reduction or setoff for an assignor's liability arising—
<br>
<br>(i) independently of the contract;
<br>
<br>(ii) on account of renegotiation under a renegotiation statute or under a statutory renegotiation article in the contract;
<br>
<br>(iii) on account of fines;
<br>
<br>(iv) on account of penalties; or
<br>
<br>(v) on account of taxes, social security contributions, or the withholding or non-withholding of taxes or social security contributions, whether arising from or independently of the contract.
<br>
<br>(C) Limitation.—Subparagraph (B)(iv) does not apply to amounts which may be collected or withheld from the assignor in accordance with or for failure to comply with the terms of the contract.

<br>
<br>In subsection (a), the words "The party to whom the Federal Government gives a contract or order" are substituted for "the party to whom such contract or order is given" for clarity. The words "A purported transfer in violation of this subsection" are substituted for "any such transfer" because an actual transfer is precluded by this provision.
<br>
<br>In subsection (b)(1), the words "amounts due from the Federal Government" are substituted for "moneys due or to become due from the United States or from any agency or department thereof" to eliminate unnecessary words. The words "may be assigned" are added to provide explicitly for authority that is necessarily implied by the source provision.
<br>
<br>In subsection (b)(3), the words "in the case of any contract entered into after October 9, 1940" are omitted as obsolete.
<br>
<br>In subsection (b)(5), the words "participating in such financing" are omitted as unnecessary.
<br>
<br>In subsection (b)(8), the words "is not liable to make any refund to the Federal Government" are substituted for "no [liability] . . . shall create or impose any liability on the part of the assignee to make restitution, refund, or repayment to the United States of any amount heretofore since July 1, 1950, or hereafter received under the assignment" to eliminate unnecessary words. The words "an assignor's liability to the Federal Government" are substituted for "liability of any nature of the assignor to the United States or any department or agency thereof " for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words.
<br>
<br>In subsection (b)(9)(A), the words "except any such contract under which full payment has been made" are omitted as unnecessary because subsection (b)(8) precludes refund where full payment has already been made. The words "payments made to an assignee under the contract" are substituted for "payments to be made to the assignee of any moneys due or to become due under such contract" to eliminate unnecessary words.
<br>
<br>In subsection (b)(9)(B), the words "When a 'no reduction or setoff ' provision as described in subparagraph (A) is included in a contract" are substituted for "If a provision described in subsection (e) of this section or a provision to the same general effect has been at any time heretofore or is hereafter included or inserted in any such contract", the words "payments to the assignee" are substituted for "payments to be made thereafter to an assignee of any moneys due or to become due", and the words "an assignor's liability" are substituted for "any liability of any nature of the assignor to the United States or any department or agency thereof ", for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words.
<br>
<br>In subsection (b)(9)(C), the text of 40:15(g), which provided that nothing in 40:15 affected rights and obligations accrued before subsection (g) was added by the Act of May 15, 1951 (ch. 75, 65 Stat. 41), is omitted as obsolete.
