<br>§7106. Agency board procedures for accelerated and small claims
<br>
<br>(a) Accelerated Procedure Where $100,000 or Less in Dispute.—The rules of each agency board shall include a procedure for the accelerated disposition of any appeal from a decision of a contracting officer where the amount in dispute is $100,000 or less. The accelerated procedure is applicable at the sole election of the contractor. An appeal under the accelerated procedure shall be resolved, whenever possible, within 180 days from the date the contractor elects to use the procedure.
<br>
<br>(b) Small Claims Procedure.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—The rules of each agency board shall include a procedure for the expedited disposition of any appeal from a decision of a contracting officer where the amount in dispute is $50,000 or less, or in the case of a small business concern (as defined in the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 631 et seq.) and regulations under that Act), $150,000 or less. The small claims procedure is applicable at the sole election of the contractor.
<br>
<br>(2) Simplified rules of procedure.—The small claims procedure shall provide for simplified rules of procedure to facilitate the decision of any appeal. An appeal under the small claims procedure may be decided by a single member of the agency board with such concurrences as may be provided by rule or regulation.
<br>
<br>(3) Time of decision.—An appeal under the small claims procedure shall be resolved, whenever possible, within 120 days from the date the contractor elects to use the procedure.
<br>
<br>(4) Finality of decision.—A decision against the Federal Government or against the contractor reached under the small claims procedure is final and conclusive and may not be set aside except in cases of fraud.
<br>
<br>(5) No precedent.—Administrative determinations and final decisions under this subsection have no value as precedent for future cases under this chapter.
<br>
<br>(6) Review of requisite amounts in controversy.—The Administrator, from time to time, may review the dollar amounts specified in paragraph (1) and adjust the amounts in accordance with economic indexes selected by the Administrator.

<br>
<br>In subsection (a), the word "only" is omitted for consistency with a similar provision in 41:608(a) and because the word "only" is redundant with the word "sole".
<br>
<br>In subsection (b)(6), the words "from time to time, may review" are substituted for "is authorized to review at least every three years" because the source law, while effectively granting the Administrator authority to conduct the reviews, does not require the Administrator to conduct any reviews, and does not restrict the number of reviews the Administrator may conduct during any time period. The words "beginning with the third year after November 1, 1978" are omitted as obsolete. The words "the dollar amount specified in paragraph (1)" are substituted for "the dollar amount defined in subsection (a) of this section as a small claim" to eliminate unnecessary words and because 41:608(a), restated as paragraph (1), does not explicitly provide a definition for the term "small claim".
<br>Senate Revision Amendment

<br>In subsec. (b)(6), "amounts" substituted for "amount" in heading and "amounts" substituted for "amount" in two places in text by S. Amdt. 4726 (111th Cong.). See 156 Cong. Rec. 18683 (2010).

<br>
<br>(2) Tennessee valley authority.—Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a decision of the board of contract appeals of the Tennessee Valley Authority is final, except that—

<br>
<br>(b) Finality of Agency Board Decisions on Questions of Law and Fact.—Notwithstanding any contract provision, regulation, or rule of law to the contrary, in an appeal by a contractor or the Federal Government from the decision of an agency board pursuant to subsection (a)—
<br>
<br>(1) the decision of the agency board on a question of law is not final or conclusive; but
<br>
<br>(2) the decision of the agency board on a question of fact is final and conclusive and may not be set aside unless the decision is—
<br>
<br>(A) fraudulent, arbitrary, or capricious;

<br>(B) so grossly erroneous as to necessarily imply bad faith; or
<br>
<br>(C) not supported by substantial evidence.

<br>
<br>(d) Consolidation.—If 2 or more actions arising from one contract are filed in the United States Court of Federal Claims and one or more agency boards, for the convenience of parties or witnesses or in the interest of justice, the United States Court of Federal Claims may order the consolidation of the actions in that court or transfer any actions to or among the agency boards involved.
<br>
<br>(e) Judgments as to Fewer Than All Claims or Parties.—In an action filed pursuant to this chapter involving 2 or more claims, counterclaims, cross-claims, or third-party claims, and where a portion of one of the claims can be divided for purposes of decision or judgment, and in any action where multiple parties are involved, the court, whenever appropriate, may enter a judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or portions of claims or parties.
<br>
<br>(f) Advisory Opinions.—

However, the Renegotiation Act of 1951 (Mar. 23, 1951, ch. 15, 65 Stat. 7) was omitted from the Code pursuant to section 102(c)(1) of the Act (65 Stat. 8), amended several times, the last being Public Law 94–185 (89 Stat. 1061), which provided that most provisions of that Act do not apply to receipts and accruals attributable to contract performance after September 30, 1976, and in view of the termination of the Renegotiation Board and the transfer of property and records of the Board to the Administrator of the General Services Administration on March 31, 1979, pursuant to Public Law 95–431 (92 Stat. 1043). Although the Renegotiation Board is no longer in existence, Federal agencies, including the General Services Administration, are required to use interest rates that are computed under the criteria set out in this subsection. See 31:3902(a) and the website of the Bureau of the Public Debt, available at http://www.publicdebt.treas.gov/opd/opdprmt2.htm.

<br>
<br>(a) In General.—
<br>
<br>(1) Persons other than individuals.—A person other than an individual shall not be considered a responsible source (as defined in section 113 of this title) for the purposes of being awarded a contract for the procurement of any property or services of a value greater than the simplified acquisition threshold (as defined in section 134 of this title) by a Federal agency, other than a contract for the procurement of commercial products or commercial services (as defined in sections 103 and 103a, respectively, of this title), unless the person agrees to provide a drug-free workplace by—
<br>
<br>(A) publishing a statement notifying employees that the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, or use of a controlled substance is prohibited in the person's workplace and specifying the actions that will be taken against employees for violations of the prohibition;
<br>
<br>(B) establishing a drug-free awareness program to inform employees about—
<br>
<br>(i) the dangers of drug abuse in the workplace;
<br>
<br>(ii) the person's policy of maintaining a drug-free workplace;
<br>
<br>(iii) available drug counseling, rehabilitation, and employee assistance programs; and
<br>
<br>(iv) the penalties that may be imposed on employees for drug abuse violations;
<br>
<br>(C) making it a requirement that each employee to be engaged in the performance of the contract be given a copy of the statement required by subparagraph (A);
<br>
<br>(D) notifying the employee in the statement required by subparagraph (A) that as a condition of employment on the contract the employee will—
<br>
<br>(i) abide by the terms of the statement; and
<br>
<br>(ii) notify the employer of any criminal drug statute conviction for a violation occurring in the workplace no later than 5 days after the conviction;
<br>
<br>(E) notifying the contracting agency within 10 days after receiving notice under subparagraph (D)(ii) from an employee or otherwise receiving actual notice of a conviction;
<br>
<br>(F) imposing a sanction on, or requiring the satisfactory participation in a drug abuse assistance or rehabilitation program by, any employee who is convicted, as required by section 8104 of this title; and
<br>
<br>(G) making a good faith effort to continue to maintain a drug-free workplace through implementation of subparagraphs (A) to (F).
<br>
<br>(2) Individuals.—A Federal agency shall not make a contract with an individual unless the individual agrees not to engage in the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, or use of a controlled substance in the performance of the contract.
<br>
<br>(b) Suspension, Termination, or Debarment of Contractor.—
<br>
<br>(1) Grounds for suspension, termination, or debarment.—Payment under a contract awarded by a Federal agency may be suspended and the contract may be terminated, and the contractor or individual who made the contract with the agency may be suspended or debarred in accordance with the requirements of this section, if the head of the agency determines that—
<br>

<br>
<br>(B) the number of employees of the contractor who have been convicted of violations of criminal drug statutes for violations occurring in the workplace indicates that the contractor has failed to make a good faith effort to provide a drug-free workplace as required by subsection (a).
<br>
<br>(2) Conduct of suspension, termination, and debarment proceedings.—A contracting officer who determines in writing that cause for suspension of payments, termination, or suspension or debarment exists shall initiate an appropriate action, to be conducted by the agency concerned in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation and applicable agency procedures. The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall be revised to include rules for conducting suspension and debarment proceedings under this subsection, including rules providing notice, opportunity to respond in writing or in person, and other procedures as may be necessary to provide a full and fair proceeding to a contractor or individual.
<br>
<br>(3) Effect of debarment.—A contractor or individual debarred by a final decision under this subsection is ineligible for award of a contract by a Federal agency, and for participation in a future procurement by a Federal agency, for a period specified in the decision, not to exceed 5 years.

<br>
<br>(b) To the extent permitted by law, determination of public interest waivers shall be made by the head of the agency with the authority over the Federal financial assistance award or Federal procurement under consideration.
<br>
<br>(c) To the extent permitted by law, before granting a public interest waiver, the relevant agency shall take appropriate account of whether a significant portion of the cost advantage of a foreign-sourced product is the result of the use of dumped steel, iron, or manufactured goods or the use of injuriously subsidized steel, iron, or manufactured goods, and it shall integrate any findings into its waiver determination as appropriate.
<br>
<br>Sec. 5. Ensuring the Integrity of the Immigration System in Order to "Hire American." (a) In order to advance the policy outlined in section 2(b) of this order, the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Labor, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, as soon as practicable, and consistent with applicable law, propose new rules and issue new guidance, to supersede or revise previous rules and guidance if appropriate, to protect the interests of United States workers in the administration of our immigration system, including through the prevention of fraud or abuse.

<br>(i) programs for which providing a domestic preference is inconsistent with law; or
<br>
<br>(ii) programs providing Federal financial assistance that are subject to comparable domestic preferences.
<br>
<br>(f) "Domestic Preference" means a preference for the purchase, acquisition, or use of goods, products, or materials produced in the United States, including iron and aluminum as well as steel, cement, and other manufactured products.
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. Application of Buy-American Principles to Covered Programs.

<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13881. Maximizing Use of American-Made Goods, Products, and Materials
<br>
<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13881, July 15, 2019, 84 F.R. 34257, provided:
<br>
<br>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and to promote the principles underlying the Buy American Act of 1933 (41 U.S.C. 8301–8305), it is hereby ordered as follows:
<br>
<br>Section 1. Policy. (a) As expressed in Executive Order 13788 of April 18, 2017 (Buy American and Hire American) [set out above], and in Executive Order 13858 of January 31, 2019 (Strengthening Buy-American Preferences for Infrastructure Projects) [set out above], it is the policy of the United States to buy American and to maximize, consistent with law, the use of goods, products, and materials produced in the United States. To those ends, my Administration shall enforce the Buy American Act to the greatest extent permitted by law.
<br>
<br>(b) In Executive Order 10582 of December 17, 1954 (Prescribing Uniform Procedures for Certain Determinations Under the Buy-American Act) [41 U.S.C. 8303 note], President Eisenhower established that materials shall be, for purposes of the Buy American Act, considered of foreign origin if the cost of the foreign products used in such materials constitutes 50 percent or more of the cost of all the products used in such materials. He also established that, in determining whether the bid or offered price of materials of domestic origin is unreasonable or inconsistent with the public interest, the executive agencies shall either (1) add 6 percent to the total bid or offered price of materials of foreign origin, or (2) add 10 percent to the total bid or offered price of materials of foreign origin less certain specified costs as follows. Where the foreign bid or offer is less than $25,000, applicable duty is excluded from the calculation. Where the foreign bid or offer is more than $25,000, both applicable duty, and all costs incurred after arrival in the United States, are excluded from the calculation.
<br>
<br>(c) The policies described in section 1(b) of this order were adopted by the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council (FAR Council) in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), title 48, Code of Federal Regulations. The FAR should be reviewed and revised, as appropriate, to most effectively carry out the goals of the Buy American Act and my Administration's policy of enforcing the Buy American Act to its maximum lawful extent. I therefore direct the members of the FAR Council to consider measures that may better effectuate this policy.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. Proposed Rules. (a) Within 180 days of the date of this order [July 15, 2019], the FAR Council shall consider proposing for notice and public comment:
<br>
<br>(i) an amendment to the applicable provisions in the FAR that would provide that materials shall be considered to be of foreign origin if:
<br>
<br>(A) for iron and steel end products, the cost of foreign iron and steel used in such iron and steel end products constitutes 5 percent or more of the cost of all the products used in such iron and steel end products; or
<br>
<br>(B) for all other end products, the cost of the foreign products used in such end products constitutes 45 percent or more of the cost of all the products used in such end products; and
<br>
<br>(ii) an amendment to the applicable provisions in the FAR that would provide that the executive agency concerned shall in each instance conduct the reasonableness and public interest determination referred to in sections 8302 and 8303 of title 41, United States Code, on the basis of the following-described differential formula, subject to the terms thereof: the sum determined by computing 20 percent (for other than small businesses), or 30 percent (for small businesses), of the offer or offered price of materials of foreign origin.
<br>
<br>(b) The FAR Council shall consider and evaluate public comments on any regulations proposed pursuant to section 2(a) of this order and shall promptly issue a final rule, if appropriate and consistent with applicable law and the national security interests of the United States. The head of each executive agency shall issue such regulations as may be necessary to ensure that agency procurement practices conform to the provisions of any final rule issued pursuant to this order.
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. Effect on Executive Order 10582. Executive Order 10582 is superseded to the extent that it is inconsistent with this order. Upon the issuance of a final rule pursuant to section 2 of this order, subsections 2(a) and 2(c) of Executive Order 10582 are revoked.
<br>
<br>Sec. 4. Additional Actions. Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall, in consultation with the FAR Council, the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the Assistant to the President for Trade and Manufacturing Policy, submit to the President a report on any other changes to the FAR that the FAR Council should consider in order to better enforce the Buy American Act and to otherwise act consistent with the policy described in section 1 of this order, including whether and when to further decrease, including incrementally, the threshold percentage in subsection 2(a)(i)(B) of this order from the proposed 45 percent to 25 percent. The report shall include recommendations based on the feasibility and desirability of any decreases, including the timing of such decreases.
<br>
<br>Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
<br>
<br>(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof, including, for example, the authority to utilize non-availability and public interest exceptions as delineated in section 8303 of title 41, United States Code, and 48 CFR 25.103; or
<br>
<br>(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
<br>
<br>(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
<br>
<br>(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

<br>§8303. Contracts for public works
<br>
<br>(a) In General.—Every contract for the construction, alteration, or repair of any public building or public work in the United States shall contain a provision that in the performance of the work the contractor, subcontractors, material men, or suppliers shall use only—
<br>
<br>(1) unmanufactured articles, materials, and supplies that have been mined or produced in the United States; and
<br>
<br>(2) manufactured articles, materials, and supplies that have been manufactured in the United States substantially all from articles, materials, or supplies mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States.
<br>
<br>(b) Exceptions.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—This section does not apply—
<br>
<br>(A) to articles, materials, or supplies for use outside the United States;
<br>
<br>(B) if articles, materials, or supplies of the class or kind to be used, or the articles, materials, or supplies from which they are manufactured, are not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities and are not of a satisfactory quality; and
<br>
<br>(C) to manufactured articles, materials, or supplies procured under any contract with an award value that is not more than the micro-purchase threshold under section 1902 of this title.
<br>
<br>(2) Particular article, material, or supply.—If the head of the department or independent establishment making the contract finds that it is impracticable to comply with subsection (a) for a particular article, material, or supply or that it would unreasonably increase the cost, an exception shall be noted in the specifications for that article, material, or supply and a public record of the findings that justified the exception shall be made.
<br>
<br>(3) Inconsistent with public interest.—Subsection (a) shall be regarded as requiring the purchase, for public use within the United States, of articles, materials, or supplies manufactured in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities and of a satisfactory quality, unless the head of the department or independent establishment concerned determines their purchase to be inconsistent with the public interest or their cost to be unreasonable.
<br>
<br>(c) Results of Failure To Comply.—If the head of a department, bureau, agency, or independent establishment that has made a contract containing the provision required by subsection (a) finds that there has been a failure to comply with the provision in the performance of the contract, the head of the department, bureau, agency, or independent establishment shall make the findings public. The findings shall include the name of the contractor obligated under the contract.

<br>
<br>Section 1. As used in this order, (a) the term "materials" includes articles and supplies, (b) the term "executive agency" includes executive department, independent establishment, and other instrumentality of the executive branch of the Government, and (c) the term "bid or offered price of materials of foreign origin" means the bid or offered price of such materials delivered at the place specified in the invitation to bid including applicable duty and all costs incurred after arrival in the United States.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. (a) For the purposes of this order materials shall be considered to be of foreign origin if the cost of the foreign products used in such materials constitutes fifty per centum or more of the cost of all the products used in such materials.
<br>
<br>(b) For the purposes of the said act of March 3, 1933 [probably means act Mar. 3, 1933, ch. 212, title III, 47 Stat. 1520, see 41 U.S.C. 8301 et seq.], and the other laws referred to in the first paragraph of the preamble of this order, the bid or offered price of materials of domestic origin shall be deemed to be unreasonable, or the purchase of such materials shall be deemed to be inconsistent with the public interest, if the bid or offered price thereof exceeds the sum of the bid or offered price of like materials of foreign origin and a differential computed as provided in subsection (c) of this section.
<br>
<br>(c) The executive agency concerned shall in each instance determine the amount of the differential referred to in subsection (b) of this section on the basis of one of the following-described formulas, subject to the terms thereof:
<br>
<br>(1) The sum determined by computing six per centum of the bid or offered price of materials of foreign origin.
<br>
<br>(2) The sum determined by computing ten per centum of the bid or offered price of materials of foreign origin exclusive of applicable duty and all costs incurred after arrival in the United States: provided that when the bid or offered price of materials of foreign origin amounts to less than $25,000, the sum shall be determined by computing ten per centum of such price exclusive only of applicable duty.
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. Nothing in this order shall affect the authority or responsibility of an executive agency:
<br>
<br>(a) To reject any bid or offer for reasons of the national interest not described or referred to in this order; or
<br>
<br>(b) To place a fair proportion of the total purchases with small business concerns in accordance with section 302(b) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended [former 41 U.S.C. 252(b)] [now 41 U.S.C. 3104], [former] section 2(b) of the Armed Services Procurement Act of 1947, as amended, and [former] section 202 of the Small Business Act of 1953; or
<br>
<br>(c) To reject a bid or offer to furnish material of foreign origin in any situation in which the domestic supplier offering the lowest price for furnishing the desired materials undertakes to produce substantially all of such materials in areas of substantial unemployment, as determined by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with such appropriate regulations as he may establish and during such period as the President may determine that it is in the national interest to provide to such areas preference in the award of Government contracts: Provided, that nothing in this section shall prevent the rejection of a bid or offered price which is excessive; or
<br>
<br>(d) To reject any bid or offer for materials of foreign origin if such rejection is necessary to protect essential national-security interests after receiving advice with respect thereto from the President or from the Director [now Administrator] of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. In providing this advice the Director [Administrator] shall be governed by the principle that exceptions under this section shall be made only upon a clear showing that the payment of a greater differential than the procedures of this section generally prescribe is justified by consideration of national security.
<br>
<br>Sec. 4. The head of each executive agency shall issue such regulations as may be necessary to insure that procurement practices under his jurisdiction conform to the provisions of this order.
<br>
<br>Sec. 5. This order shall apply only to contracts entered into after the date hereof. In any case in which the head of an executive agency proposing to purchase domestic materials determines that a greater differential than that provided in this order between the cost of such materials of domestic origin and materials of foreign origin is not unreasonable or that the purchase of materials of domestic origin is not inconsistent with the public interest, this order shall not apply. A written report of the facts of each case in which such a determination is made shall be submitted to the President through the Director of the Office of Management and Budget by the official making the determination within 30 days thereafter.
<br>
<br>[Ex. Ord. No. 10582, set out above, superseded to the extent that it is inconsistent with Ex. Ord. No. 13881, and section 2(a) and (c) of Ex. Ord.

<br>§8304. Waiver rescission
<br>
<br>(a) Type of Agreement.—An agreement referred to in subsection (b) is a reciprocal defense procurement memorandum of understanding between the United States and a foreign country pursuant to which the Secretary of Defense has prospectively waived this chapter for certain products in that country.
<br>
<br>(b) Determination by Secretary of Defense.—If the Secretary of Defense, after consultation with the United States Trade Representative, determines that a foreign country that is party to an agreement described in subsection (a) has violated the agreement by discriminating against certain types of products produced in the United States that are covered by the agreement, the Secretary of Defense shall rescind the Secretary's blanket waiver of this chapter with respect to those types of products produced in that country.

<br>
<br>(8) Severely disabled individual.—The term "severely disabled individual" means an individual or class of individuals under a physical or mental disability, other than blindness, which (according to criteria established by the Committee after consultation with appropriate entities of the Federal Government and taking into account the views of non-Federal Government entities representing the disabled) constitutes a substantial handicap to employment and is of a nature that prevents the individual from currently engaging in normal competitive employment.

<br>
<br>In this chapter, the word "disabled" is substituted for "handicapped" for consistency with the name of the Committee. The word "product" is substituted for "commodity" to reflect the current usage of the items produced in the Committee's program.
<br>
<br>In this section, the text of 41:48b(6) is omitted as unnecessary.
<br>
<br>In paragraph (9), the words "the Northern Mariana Islands" are substituted for "the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands" because the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands terminated. See 48 U.S.C. note prec. 1681. However, section 502(a)(2) of the Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of America (48 U.S.C. 1801 note) provided that laws in existence on the effective date of section 502 that were applicable to Guam and that were of general application to the several States would apply to the Northern Mariana Islands. The Marshall Islands, Palau, and the Federated States of Micronesia are not included because although they were part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, they are independent entities and not part of the United States.
