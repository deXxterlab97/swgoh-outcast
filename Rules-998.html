<br>For purposes of subparagraph (A)(i), the percentage of grant or loan assistance under this subchapter that has been earned by the student is—
<br>
<br>(i) equal to the percentage of the payment period or period of enrollment for which assistance was awarded that was completed (as determined in accordance with subsection (d)) as of the day the student withdrew, provided that such date occurs on or before the completion of 60 percent of the payment period or period of enrollment; or

<br>
<br>(ii) applying the percentage determined under clause (i) to the total amount of such grant and loan assistance that was disbursed (and that could have been disbursed) to the student, or on the student's behalf, for the payment period or period of enrollment, as of the day the student withdrew.
<br>(4) Differences between amounts earned and amounts received
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>After determining the eligibility of the student for a late disbursement or post-withdrawal disbursement (as required in regulations prescribed by the Secretary), the institution of higher education shall contact the borrower and obtain confirmation that the loan funds are still required by the borrower. In making such contact, the institution shall explain to the borrower the borrower's obligation to repay the funds following any such disbursement. The institution shall document in the borrower's file the result of such contact and the final determination made concerning such disbursement.

<br>Notwithstanding paragraph (1), if the institution determines that a student did not begin the withdrawal process, or otherwise notify the institution of the intent to withdraw, due to illness, accident, grievous personal loss, or other such circumstances beyond the student's control, the institution may determine the appropriate withdrawal date.
<br>(d) Percentage of the payment period or period of enrollment completed

<br>In this section, the term "service in the uniformed services" means service (whether voluntary or involuntary) on active duty in the Armed Forces, including such service by a member of the National Guard or Reserve, for a period of more than 30 days under a call or order to active duty of more than 30 days.
<br>(b) Discrimination against students who serve in the uniformed services prohibited
<br>
<br>A person who is a member of, applies to be a member of, performs, has performed, applies to perform, or has an obligation to perform, service in the uniformed services shall not be denied readmission to an institution of higher education on the basis of that membership, application for membership, performance of service, application for service, or obligation.
<br>(c) Readmission procedures
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Any student whose absence from an institution of higher education is necessitated by reason of service in the uniformed services shall be entitled to readmission to the institution of higher education if—

<br>
<br>(ii) a pending or ongoing mission, operation, exercise, or requirement that may be compromised or otherwise adversely affected by public knowledge.

<br>
<br>Any student (or an appropriate officer of the Armed Forces or official of the Department of Defense) who did not give advance written or verbal notice of service to the appropriate official at the institution of higher education in accordance with paragraph (1)(A) may meet the notice requirement by submitting, at the time the student seeks readmission, an attestation to the student's institution of higher education that the student performed service in the uniformed services that necessitated the student's absence from the institution of higher education.
<br>(3) Applicability
<br>
<br>This section shall apply to a student who is absent from an institution of higher education by reason of service in the uniformed services if such student's cumulative period of service in the Armed Forces (including the National Guard or Reserve), with respect to the institution of higher education for which a student seeks readmission, does not exceed five years, except that any such period of service shall not include any service—
<br>
<br>(A) that is required, beyond five years, to complete an initial period of obligated service;
<br>
<br>(B) during which such student was unable to obtain orders releasing such student from a period of service in the uniformed services before the expiration of such five-year period and such inability was through no fault of such student; or

<br>References in Text
<br>
<br>Sections 251 and 252 of title 14, referred to in subsec. (c)(3)(C)(i), probably should be references to sections 2127 and 2128 of title 14. Prior to amendment by Pub. L. 115–232, §1204(b)(2) (see 2018 Amendment note below), those references were to sections 331 and 332 of title 14 and probably should not have been amended by Pub. L. 115–232 to conform to the renumbering of those sections as sections 251 and 252 because the renumbered sections were in title 10 of the Code and not title 14. Sections 331 and 332 of title 14 were renumbered sections 2127 and 2128, respectively, of title 14 by Pub. L. 115–282, title I, §112(b), Dec. 4, 2018, 132 Stat. 4216, and references to sections 331 and 332 of title 14 deemed to refer to such redesignated sections, see section 123(b)(1) of Pub. L. 115–282, set out as a References to Sections of Title 14 as Redesignated by Pub. L. 115–282 note preceding section 101 of Title 14, Coast Guard.
<br>
<br>Sections 359, 360, 367, and 712 of title 14, referred to in subsec. (c)(3)(C)(i), were renumbered sections 2308, 2309, 2314, and 3713, respectively, of title 14 by Pub. L. 115–282, title I, §§113(b), 118(b), Dec. 4, 2018, 132 Stat. 4221, 4233, and references to sections 359, 360, 367, and 712 of title 14 considered to refer to such sections, see section 123(b)(1) of Pub.
