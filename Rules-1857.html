<br>
<br>(c)(1) Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, if there are two parents, but they are not living together, the monthly rate of dependency and indemnity compensation paid to each such parent shall be $412, as increased from time to time under section 5312(b)(1) of this title and reduced by an amount, based upon the amount of such parent's annual income, determined in accordance with regulations which the Secretary shall prescribe under section 5312(b)(2) of this title.

<br>
<br>(e) The Secretary may require as a condition of granting or continuing dependency and indemnity compensation to a parent that such parent, other than one who has attained seventy-two years of age and has been paid dependency and indemnity compensation during two consecutive calendar years, file for a calendar year with the Secretary (on the form prescribed by the Secretary) a report showing the total income which such parent expects to receive in that year and the total income which such parent received in the preceding year. The parent or parents shall notify the Secretary whenever there is a material change in annual income.
