The corporation is authorized to waive the requirement of the preceding sentence with respect to any or all reportable events with respect to any plan, and to require the notification to be made by including the event in the annual report made by the plan.
<br>(b) Notification that event is about to occur
<br>
<br>(1) The requirements of this subsection shall be applicable to a contributing sponsor if, as of the close of the preceding plan year—
<br>
<br>(A) the  aggregate  unfunded  vested  benefits (as determined under section 1306(a)(3)(E)(iii) of this title) of plans subject to this subchapter which are maintained by such sponsor and members of such sponsor's controlled groups (disregarding plans with no unfunded vested benefits) exceed $50,000,000, and
<br>
<br>(B) the funded vested benefit percentage for such plans is less than 90 percent.
<br>
<br>For purposes of subparagraph (B), the funded vested benefit percentage means the percentage which the aggregate value of the assets of such plans bears to the aggregate vested benefits of such plans (determined in accordance with section 1306(a)(3)(E)(iii) of this title).

<br>(3) when the number of active participants is less than 80 percent of the number of such participants at the beginning of the plan year, or is less than 75 percent of the number of such participants at the beginning of the previous plan year;
<br>
<br>(4) when the Secretary of the Treasury determines that there has been a termination or partial termination of the plan within the meaning of section 411(d)(3) of title 26, but the occurrence of such a termination or partial termination does not, by itself, constitute or require a termination of a plan under this subchapter;
<br>
<br>(5) when the plan fails to meet the minimum funding standards under section 412 of title 26 (without regard to whether the plan is a plan described in section 1321(a)(2) of this title) or under section 1082 of this title;
<br>
<br>(6) when the plan is unable to pay benefits thereunder when due;

<br>
<br>(9) when, as a result of an event, a person ceases to be a member of the controlled group;

<br>(10) when a contributing sponsor or a member of a contributing sponsor's controlled group liquidates in a case under title 11, or under any similar Federal law or law of a State or political subdivision of a State;
<br>
<br>(11) when a contributing sponsor or a member of a contributing sponsor's controlled group declares an extraordinary dividend (as defined in section 1059(c) of title 26) or redeems, in any 12-month period, an aggregate of 10 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote, or an aggregate of 10 percent or more of the total value of shares of all classes of stock, of a contributing sponsor and all members of its controlled group;

<br>
<br>(13) when any other event occurs that may be indicative of a need to terminate the plan and that is prescribed by the corporation in regulations.

<br>
<br>(3) Third, in the case of benefits payable as an annuity—
<br>
<br>(A) in the case of the benefit of a participant or beneficiary which was in pay status as of the beginning of the 3-year period ending on the termination date of the plan, to each such benefit, based on the provisions of the plan (as in effect during the 5-year period ending on such date) under which such benefit would be the least,
<br>
<br>(B) in the case of a participant's or beneficiary's benefit (other than a benefit described in subparagraph (A)) which would have been in pay status as of the beginning of such 3-year period if the participant had retired prior to the beginning of the 3-year period and if his benefits had commenced (in the normal form of annuity under the plan) as of the beginning of such period, to each such benefit based on the provisions of the plan (as in effect during the 5-year period ending on such date) under which such benefit would be the least.
<br>
<br>For purposes of subparagraph (A), the lowest benefit in pay status during a 3-year period shall be considered the benefit in pay status for such period.
<br>
<br>(4) Fourth—
<br>
<br>(A) to all other benefits (if any) of individuals under the plan guaranteed under this subchapter (determined without regard to section 1322b(a) of this title), and
<br>
<br>(B) to the additional benefits (if any) which would be determined under subparagraph (A) if section 1322(b)(5)(B) of this title did not apply.
<br>
<br>For purposes of this paragraph, section 1321 of this title shall be applied without regard to subsection (c) thereof.
<br>
<br>(5) Fifth, to all other nonforfeitable benefits under the plan.
<br>
<br>(6) Sixth, to all other benefits under the plan.
<br>(b) Adjustment of allocations; reallocations; mandatory contributions; establishment of subclasses and categories
<br>
<br>For purposes of subsection (a)—
<br>
<br>(1) The amount allocated under any paragraph of subsection (a) with respect to any benefit shall be properly adjusted for any allocation of assets with respect to that benefit under a prior paragraph of subsection (a).
<br>
<br>(2) If the assets available for allocation under any paragraph of subsection (a) (other than paragraphs (4), (5), and (6)) are insufficient to satisfy in full the benefits of all individuals which are described in that paragraph, the assets shall be allocated pro rata among such individuals on the basis of the present value (as of the termination date) of their respective benefits described in that paragraph.
<br>
<br>(3) If assets available for allocation under paragraph (4) of subsection (a) are insufficient to satisfy in full the benefits of all individuals who are described in that paragraph, the assets shall be allocated first to benefits described in subparagraph (A) of that paragraph. Any remaining assets shall then be allocated to benefits described in subparagraph (B) of that paragraph. If assets allocated to such subparagraph (B) are insufficient to satisfy in full the benefits described in that subparagraph, the assets shall be allocated pro rata among individuals on the basis of the present value (as of the termination date) of their respective benefits described in that subparagraph.
<br>
<br>(4) This paragraph applies if the assets available for allocation under paragraph (5) of subsection (a) are not sufficient to satisfy in full the benefits of individuals described in that paragraph.
<br>
<br>(A) If this paragraph applies, except as provided in subparagraph (B), the assets shall be allocated to the benefits of individuals described in such paragraph (5) on the basis of the benefits of individuals which would have been described in such paragraph (5) under the plan as in effect at the beginning of the 5-year period ending on the date of plan termination.
<br>
<br>(B) If the assets available for allocation under subparagraph (A) are sufficient to satisfy in full the benefits described in such subparagraph (without regard to this subparagraph), then for purposes of subparagraph (A), benefits of individuals described in such subparagraph shall be determined on the basis of the plan as amended by the most recent plan amendment effective during such 5-year period under which the assets available for allocation are sufficient to satisfy in full the benefits of individuals described in subparagraph (A) and any assets remaining to be allocated under such subparagraph shall be allocated under subparagraph (A) on the basis of the plan as amended by the next succeeding plan amendment effective during such period.
<br>
<br>(5) If the Secretary of the Treasury determines that the allocation made pursuant to this section (without regard to this paragraph) results in discrimination prohibited by section 401(a)(4) of title 26 then, if required to prevent the disqualification of the plan (or any trust under the plan) under section 401(a) or 403(a) of title 26, the assets allocated under subsections (a)(4)(B), (a)(5), and (a)(6) shall be reallocated to the extent necessary to avoid such discrimination.
<br>
<br>(6) The term "mandatory contributions" means amounts contributed to the plan by a participant which are required as a condition of employment, as a condition of participation in such plan, or as a condition of obtaining benefits under the plan attributable to employer contributions. For this purpose, the total amount of mandatory contributions of a participant is the amount of such contributions reduced (but not below zero) by the sum of the amounts paid or distributed to him under the plan before its termination.
<br>
<br>(7) A plan may establish subclasses and categories within the classes described in paragraphs (1) through (6) of subsection (a) in accordance with regulations prescribed by the corporation.
<br>(c) Increase or decrease in value of assets
<br>
<br>Any increase or decrease in the value of the assets of a single-employer plan occurring during the period beginning on the later of (1) the date a trustee is appointed under section 1342(b) of this title or (2) the date on which the plan is terminated is to be allocated between the plan and the corporation in the manner determined by the court (in the case of a court-appointed trustee) or as agreed upon by the corporation and the plan administrator in any other case. Any increase or decrease in the value of the assets of a single-employer plan occurring after the date on which the plan is terminated shall be credited to, or suffered by, the corporation.
<br>(d) Distribution of residual assets; restrictions on reversions pursuant to recently amended plans; assets attributable to employee contributions; calculation of remaining assets
<br>
<br>(1) Subject to paragraph (3), any residual assets of a single-employer plan may be distributed to the employer if—
<br>
<br>(A) all liabilities of the plan to participants and their beneficiaries have been satisfied,
<br>
<br>(B) the distribution does not contravene any provision of law, and
<br>
<br>(C) the plan provides for such a distribution in these circumstances.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) In determining the extent to which a plan provides for the distribution of plan assets to the employer for purposes of paragraph (1)(C), any such provision, and any amendment increasing the amount which may be distributed to the employer, shall not be treated as effective before the end of the fifth calendar year following the date of the adoption of such provision or amendment.
<br>
<br>(B) A distribution to the employer from a plan shall not be treated as failing to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph if the plan has been in effect for fewer than 5 years and the plan has provided for such a distribution since the effective date of the plan.
<br>
<br>(C) Except as otherwise provided in regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury, in any case in which a transaction described in section 1058 of this title occurs, subparagraph (A) shall continue to apply separately with respect to the amount of any assets transferred in such transaction.
<br>
<br>(D) For purposes of this subsection, the term "employer" includes any member of the controlled group of which the employer is a member. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term "controlled group" means any group treated as a single employer under subsection (b), (c), (m) or (o) of section 414 of title 26.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) Before any distribution from a plan pursuant to paragraph (1), if any assets of the plan attributable to employee contributions remain after satisfaction of all liabilities described in subsection (a), such remaining assets shall be equitably distributed to the participants who made such contributions or their beneficiaries (including alternate payees, within the meaning of section 1056(d)(3)(K) of this title).
<br>
<br>(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the portion of the remaining assets which are attributable to employee contributions shall be an amount equal to the product derived by multiplying—
<br>
<br>(i) the market value of the total remaining assets, by
<br>
<br>(ii) a fraction—
<br>
<br>(I) the numerator of which is the present value of all portions of the accrued benefits with respect to participants which are derived from participants' mandatory contributions (referred to in subsection (a)(2)), and
<br>
<br>(II) the denominator of which is the present value of all benefits with respect to which assets are allocated under paragraphs (2) through (6) of subsection (a).
<br>
<br>(C) For purposes of this paragraph, each person who is, as of the termination date—
<br>
<br>(i) a participant under the plan, or
<br>
<br>(ii) an individual who has received, during the 3-year period ending with the termination date, a distribution from the plan of such individual's entire nonforfeitable benefit in the form of a single sum distribution in accordance with section 1053(e) of this title or in the form of irrevocable commitments purchased by the plan from an insurer to provide such nonforfeitable benefit,
<br>
<br>shall be treated as a participant with respect to the termination, if all or part of the nonforfeitable benefit with respect to such person is or was attributable to participants' mandatory contributions (referred to in subsection (a)(2)).
<br>
<br>(4) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit the requirements of section 4980(d) of title 26 (as in effect immediately after the enactment of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990) or section 1104(d) of this title with respect to any distribution of residual assets of a single-employer plan to the employer.
<br>(e) Bankruptcy filing substituted for termination date
<br>
<br>If a contributing sponsor of a plan has filed or has had filed against such person a petition seeking liquidation or reorganization in a case under title 11 or under any similar Federal law or law of a State or political subdivision, and the case has not been dismissed as of the termination date of the plan, then subsection (a)(3) shall be applied by treating the date such petition was filed as the termination date of the plan.
<br>(f) Valuation of section 1362(c) liability for determining amounts payable by corporation to participants and beneficiaries
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>In the case of a terminated plan, the value of the recovery of liability under section 1362(c) of this title allocable as a plan asset under this section for purposes of determining the amount of benefits payable by the corporation shall be determined by multiplying—
<br>
<br>(A) the amount of liability under section 1362(c) of this title as of the termination date of the plan, by
<br>
<br>(B) the applicable section 1362(c) recovery ratio.
<br>(2) Section 1362(c) recovery ratio
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subsection—
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subparagraph (C), the term "section 1362(c) recovery ratio" means the ratio which—
<br>
<br>(i) the sum of the values of all recoveries under section 1362(c) of this title determined by the corporation in connection with plan terminations described under subparagraph (B), bears to
<br>
<br>(ii) the sum of all the amounts of liability under section 1362(c) of this title with respect to such plans as of the termination date in connection with any such prior termination.
<br>(B) Prior terminations
<br>
<br>A plan termination described in this subparagraph is a termination with respect to which—
<br>
<br>(i) the value of recoveries under section 1362(c) of this title have been determined by the corporation, and
<br>
<br>(ii) notices of intent to terminate were provided (or in the case of a termination by the corporation, a notice of determination under section 1342 of this title was issued) during the 5-Federal fiscal year period ending with the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year in which occurs the date of the notice of intent to terminate (or the notice of determination under section 1342 of this title) with respect to the plan termination for which the recovery ratio is being determined.
<br>(C) Exception
<br>
<br>In the case of a terminated plan with respect to which the outstanding amount of benefit liabilities exceeds $20,000,000, the term "section 1362(c) recovery ratio" means, with respect to the termination of such plan, the ratio of—
<br>
<br>(i) the value of the recoveries on behalf of the plan under section 1362(c) of this title, to
<br>
<br>(ii) the amount of the liability owed under section 1362(c) of this title as of the date of plan termination to the trustee appointed under section 1342(b) or (c) of this title.
<br>(3) Subsection not to apply
<br>
<br>This subsection shall not apply with respect to the determination of—
<br>
<br>(A) whether the amount of outstanding benefit liabilities exceeds $20,000,000, or
<br>
<br>(B) the amount of any liability under section 1362 of this title to the corporation or the trustee appointed under section 1342(b) or (c) of this title.
<br>(4) Determinations
<br>
<br>Determinations under this subsection shall be made by the corporation. Such determinations shall be binding unless shown by clear and convincing evidence to be unreasonable.

<br>§1347. Restoration of plans
<br>
<br>Whenever the corporation determines that a plan which is to be terminated under section 1341 or 1342 of this title, or which is in the process of being terminated under section 1341 or 1342 of this title, should not be terminated under section 1341 or 1342 of this title as a result of such circumstances as the corporation determines to be relevant, the corporation is authorized to cease any activities undertaken to terminate the plan, and to take whatever action is necessary and within its power to restore the plan to its status prior to the determination that the plan was to be terminated under section 1341 or 1342 of this title. In the case of a plan which has been terminated under section 1341 or 1342 of this title the corporation is authorized in any such case in which the corporation determines such action to be appropriate and consistent with its duties under this subchapter, to take such action as may be necessary to restore the plan to its pretermination status, including, but not limited to, the transfer to the employer or a plan administrator of control of part or all of the remaining assets and liabilities of the plan.

<br>A plan administrator satisfies section 1341(b)(3)(A) of this title in the case of a missing participant only if the plan administrator—

<br>(A) transfers the participant's designated benefit to the corporation or purchases an irrevocable commitment from an insurer in accordance with clause (i) of section 1341(b)(3)(A) of this title, and
<br>
<br>(B) provides the corporation such information and certifications with respect to such designated benefits or irrevocable commitments as the corporation shall specify.
<br>(2) Treatment of transferred assets

<br>(3) Payment by the corporation
<br>
<br>After a missing participant whose designated benefit was transferred to the corporation is located—
<br>
<br>(A) in any case in which the plan could have distributed the benefit of the missing participant in a single sum without participant or spousal consent under section 1055(g) of this title, the corporation shall pay the participant or beneficiary a single sum benefit equal to the designated benefit paid the corporation plus interest as specified by the corporation, and
<br>
<br>(B) in any other case, the corporation shall pay a benefit based on the designated benefit and the assumptions prescribed by the corporation at the time that the corporation received the designated benefit.
<br>
<br>The corporation shall make payments under subparagraph (B) available in the same forms and at the same times as a guaranteed benefit under section 1322 of this title would be available to be paid, except that the corporation may make a benefit available in the form of a single sum if the plan provided a single sum benefit (other than a single sum described in subsection (b)(2)(A)).
<br>(b) Definitions

<br>§1362. Liability for termination of single-employer plans under a distress termination or a termination by corporation

<br>
<br>In any case in which a single-employer plan is terminated in a distress termination under section 1341(c) of this title or a termination otherwise instituted by the corporation under section 1342 of this title, any person who is, on the termination date, a contributing sponsor of the plan or a member of such a contributing sponsor's controlled group shall incur liability under this section. The liability under this section of all such persons shall be joint and several. The liability under this section consists of—
<br>
<br>(1) liability to the corporation, to the extent provided in subsection (b), and
<br>
<br>(2) liability to the trustee appointed under subsection (b) or (c) of section 1342 of this title, to the extent provided in subsection (c).
<br>(b) Liability to corporation
<br>(1) Amount of liability
<br>(A) In general
<br>

<br>(B) Special rule in case of subsequent insufficiency
<br>
<br>For purposes of subparagraph (A), in any case described in section 1341(c)(3)(C)(ii) of this title, actuarial present values shall be determined as of the date of the notice to the corporation (or the finding by the corporation) described in such section.

<br>
<br>Payment of so much of the liability under paragraph (1)(A) as exceeds 30 percent of the collective net worth of all persons described in subsection (a) (including interest) shall be made under commercially reasonable terms prescribed by the corporation. The parties involved shall make a reasonable effort to reach agreement on such commercially reasonable terms. Any such terms prescribed by the corporation shall provide for deferral of 50 percent of any amount of liability otherwise payable for any year under this subparagraph if a person subject to such liability demonstrates to the satisfaction of the corporation that no person subject to such liability has any individual pre-tax profits for such person's fiscal year ending during such year.
<br>(3) Alternative arrangements
<br>
<br>The corporation and any person liable under this section may agree to alternative arrangements for the satisfaction of liability to the corporation under this subsection.

<br>
<br>(2) the sum of the waiver amortization charge (within the meaning of section 1083(e)(1) of this title and 430(e)(1) 1 of title 26) with respect to the plan (if any) for the plan year in which the termination date occurs, plus the aggregate total of waiver amortization installments (if any) determined for succeeding plan years under section 1083(e)(2) of this title and section 430(e)(2) of title 26,
<br>
<br>together with interest (at a reasonable rate) calculated from the termination date in accordance with regulations prescribed by the corporation.

<br>
<br>(ii) increased by the amount of any transfers of assets made by the person which are determined by the corporation to be improper under the circumstances, including any such transfers which would be inappropriate under title 11 if the person were a debtor in a case under chapter 7 of such title.
<br>(C) Timing of determination
<br>
<br>For purposes of this paragraph, determinations of net worth shall be made as of a day chosen by the corporation (during the 120-day period ending with the termination date) and shall be computed without regard to any liability under this section.
<br>(2) Pre-tax profits
<br>
<br>The term "pre-tax profits" means—
<br>

<br>(e) Treatment of substantial cessation of operations
<br>(1) General rule
<br>
<br>Except as provided in paragraphs (3) and (4), if there is a substantial cessation of operations at a facility in any location, the employer shall be treated with respect to any single employer plan established and maintained by the employer covering participants at such facility as if the employer were a substantial employer under a plan under which more than one employer makes contributions and the provisions of sections 1363, 1364, and 1365 of this title shall apply.
<br>(2) Substantial cessation of operations
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subsection:
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The term "substantial cessation of operations" means a permanent cessation of operations at a facility which results in a workforce reduction of a number of eligible employees at the facility equivalent to more than 15 percent of the number of all eligible employees of the employer, determined immediately before the earlier of—
<br>
<br>(i) the date of the employer's decision to implement such cessation, or
<br>
<br>(ii) in the case of a workforce reduction which includes 1 or more eligible employees described in paragraph (6)(B), the earliest date on which any such eligible employee was separated from employment.
<br>(B) Workforce reduction
<br>
<br>Subject to subparagraphs (C) and (D), the term "workforce reduction" means the number of eligible employees at a facility who are separated from employment by reason of the permanent cessation of operations of the employer at the facility.
<br>(C) Relocation of workforce
<br>
<br>An eligible employee separated from employment at a facility shall not be taken into account in computing a workforce reduction if, within a reasonable period of time, the employee is replaced by the employer, at the same or another facility located in the United States, by an employee who is a citizen or resident of the United States.
<br>(D) Dispositions
<br>
<br>If, whether by reason of a sale or other disposition of the assets or stock of a contributing sponsor (or any member of the same controlled group as such a sponsor) of the plan relating to operations at a facility or otherwise, an employer (the "transferee employer") other than the employer which experiences the substantial cessation of operations (the "transferor employer") conducts any portion of such operations, then—
<br>
<br>(i) an eligible employee separated from employment with the transferor employer at the facility shall not be taken into account in computing a workforce reduction if—
<br>
<br>(I) within a reasonable period of time, the employee is replaced by the transferee employer by an employee who is a citizen or resident of the United States; and
<br>
<br>(II) in the case of an eligible employee who is a participant in a single employer plan maintained by the transferor employer, the transferee employer, within a reasonable period of time, maintains a single employer plan which includes the assets and liabilities attributable to the accrued benefit of the eligible employee at the time of separation from employment with the transferor employer; and
<br>
<br>(ii) an eligible employee who continues to be employed at the facility by the transferee employer shall not be taken into account in computing a workforce reduction if—
<br>
<br>(I) the eligible employee is not a participant in a single employer plan maintained by the transferor employer, or
<br>
<br>(II) in any other case, the transferee employer, within a reasonable period of time, maintains a single employer plan which includes the assets and liabilities attributable to the accrued benefit of the eligible employee at the time of separation from employment with the transferor employer.
<br>(3) Exemption for plans with limited underfunding
<br>
<br>Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to a single employer plan if, for the plan year preceding the plan year in which the cessation occurred—
<br>
<br>(A) there were fewer than 100 participants with accrued benefits under the plan as of the valuation date of the plan for the plan year (as determined under section 1083(g)(2) of this title); or
<br>
<br>(B) the ratio of the market value of the assets of the plan to the funding target of the plan for the plan year was 90 percent or greater.
<br>(4) Election to make additional contributions to satisfy liability
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>An employer may elect to satisfy the employer's liability with respect to a plan by reason of paragraph (1) by making additional contributions to the plan in the amount determined under subparagraph (B) for each plan year in the 7-plan-year period beginning with the plan year in which the cessation occurred. Any such additional contribution for a plan year shall be in addition to any minimum required contribution under section 1083 of this title for such plan year and shall be paid not later than the earlier of—
<br>
<br>(i) the due date for the minimum required contribution for such year under section 1083(j) of this title; or
<br>
<br>(ii) in the case of the first such contribution, the date that is 1 year after the date on which the employer notifies the Corporation of the substantial cessation of operations or the date the Corporation determines a substantial cessation of operations has occurred, and in the case of subsequent contributions, the same date in each succeeding year.
<br>(B) Amount determined
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in clause (iii), the amount determined under this subparagraph with respect to each plan year in the 7-plan-year period is the product of—
<br>
<br>(I) 1/7 of the unfunded vested benefits determined under section 1306(a)(3)(E) of this title as of the valuation date of the plan (as determined under section 1083(g)(2) of this title) for the plan year preceding the plan year in which the cessation occurred; and
<br>
<br>(II) the reduction fraction.
<br>(ii) Reduction fraction
<br>
<br>For purposes of clause (i), the reduction fraction of a single employer plan is equal to—
<br>
<br>(I) the number of participants with accrued benefits in the plan who were included in computing the workforce reduction under paragraph (2)(B) as a result of the cessation of operations at the facility; divided by
<br>
<br>(II) the number of eligible employees of the employer who are participants with accrued benefits in the plan, determined as of the same date the determination under paragraph (2)(A) is made.
<br>(iii) Limitation
<br>
<br>The additional contribution under this subparagraph for any plan year shall not exceed the excess, if any, of—
<br>
<br>(I) 25 percent of the difference between the market value of the assets of the plan and the funding target of the plan for the preceding plan year; over
<br>
<br>(II) the minimum required contribution under section 1083 of this title for the plan year.
<br>(C) Permitted cessation of annual installments when plan becomes sufficiently funded
<br>
<br>An employer's obligation to make additional contributions under this paragraph shall not apply to—
<br>
<br>(i) the first plan year (beginning on or after the first day of the plan year in which the cessation occurs) for which the ratio of the market value of the assets of the plan to the funding target of the plan for the plan year is 90 percent or greater, or
<br>
<br>(ii) any plan year following such first plan year.
<br>(D) Coordination with funding waivers
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>If the Secretary of the Treasury issues a funding waiver under section 1082(c) of this title with respect to the plan for a plan year in the 7-plan-year period under subparagraph (A), the additional contribution with respect to such plan year shall be permanently waived.
<br>(ii) Notice
<br>
<br>An employer maintaining a plan with respect to which such a funding waiver has been issued or a request for such a funding waiver is pending shall provide notice to the Secretary of the Treasury, in such form and at such time as the Secretary of the Treasury shall provide, of a cessation of operations to which paragraph (1) applies.
<br>(E) Enforcement
<br>(i) Notice
<br>
<br>An employer making the election under this paragraph shall provide notice to the Corporation, in accordance with rules prescribed by the Corporation, of—
<br>
<br>(I) such election, not later than 30 days after the earlier of the date the employer notifies the Corporation of the substantial cessation of operations or the date the Corporation determines a substantial cessation of operations has occurred;
<br>
<br>(II) the payment of each additional contribution, not later than 10 days after such payment;
<br>
<br>(III) any failure to pay the additional contribution in the full amount for any year in the 7-plan-year period, not later than 10 days after the due date for such payment;
<br>
<br>(IV) the waiver under subparagraph (D)(i) of the obligation to make an additional contribution for any year, not later than 30 days after the funding waiver described in such subparagraph is granted; and
<br>
<br>(V) the cessation of any obligation to make additional contributions under subparagraph (C), not later than 10 days after the due date for payment of the additional contribution for the first plan year to which such cessation applies.
<br>(ii) Acceleration of liability to the plan for failure to pay
<br>
<br>If an employer fails to pay the additional contribution in the full amount for any year in the 7-plan-year period by the due date for such payment, the employer shall, as of such date, be liable to the plan in an amount equal to the balance which remains unpaid as of such date of the aggregate amount of additional contributions required to be paid by the employer during such 7-year-plan period. The Corporation may waive or settle the liability described in the preceding sentence, at the discretion of the Corporation.
<br>(iii) Civil action
<br>
<br>The Corporation may bring a civil action in the district courts of the United States in accordance with section 1303(e) of this title to compel an employer making such election to pay the additional contributions required under this paragraph.
<br>(5) Definitions
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subsection:
<br>(A) Eligible employee
<br>
<br>The term "eligible employee" means an employee who is eligible to participate in an employee pension benefit plan (as defined in section 1002(2) of this title) established and maintained by the employer.
<br>(B) Funding target
<br>
<br>The term "funding target" means, with respect to any plan year, the funding target as determined under section 1306(a)(3)(E)(iii)(I) of this title for purposes of determining the premium paid to the Corporation under section 1307 of this title for the plan year.
<br>(C) Market value
<br>
<br>The market value of the assets of a plan shall be determined in the same manner as for purposes of section 1306(a)(3)(E) of this title.
<br>(6) Special rules
<br>(A) Change in operation of certain facilities and property
<br>
<br>For purposes of paragraphs (1) and (2), an employer shall not be treated as ceasing operations at a qualified lodging facility (as defined in section 856(d)(9)(D) of title 26) if such operations are continued by an eligible independent contractor (as defined in section 856(d)(9)(A) of such title) pursuant to an agreement with the employer.
<br>(B) Aggregation of prior separations
<br>
<br>The workforce reduction under paragraph (2) with respect to any cessation of operations shall be determined by taking into account any separation from employment of any eligible employee at the facility (other than a separation which is not taken into account as workforce reduction by reason of subparagraph (C) or (D) of paragraph (2)) which—
<br>
<br>(i) is related to the permanent cessation of operations of the employer at the facility, and
<br>
<br>(ii) occurs during the 3-year period preceding such cessation.
<br>(C) No addition to prefunding balance
<br>
<br>For purposes of section 1083(f)(6)(B) of this title and section 430(f)(6)(B) of title 26, any additional contribution made under paragraph (4) shall be treated in the same manner as a contribution an employer is required to make in order to avoid a benefit reduction under paragraph (1), (2), or (4) of section 1056(g) of this title or subsection (b), (c), or (e) of section 436 of title 26 for the plan year.
