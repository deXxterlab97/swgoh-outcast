<br>§1087bb. Allocation of funds
<br>(a) Allocation based on previous allocation
<br>
<br>(1) From the amount appropriated pursuant to section 1087aa(b) 1 of this title for each fiscal year, the Secretary shall first allocate to each eligible institution an amount equal to—
<br>
<br>(A) 100 percent of the amount received under subsections (a) and (b) of this section for fiscal year 1999 (as such subsections were in effect with respect to allocations for such fiscal year), multiplied by
<br>
<br>(B) the institution's default penalty, as determined under subsection (e),
<br>
<br>except that if the institution has a cohort default rate in excess of the applicable maximum cohort default rate under subsection (f), the institution may not receive an allocation under this paragraph.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) From the amount so appropriated, the Secretary shall next allocate to each eligible institution that began participation in the program under this part after fiscal year 1999 but is not a first or second time participant, an amount equal to the greater of—
<br>
<br>(i) $5,000; or
<br>
<br>(ii) 100 percent of the amount received and expended under this part for the first year it participated in the program.
<br>
<br>(B) From the amount so appropriated, the Secretary shall next allocate to each eligible institution that began participation in the program under this part after fiscal year 1999 and is a first or second time participant, an amount equal to the greatest of—
<br>
<br>(i) $5,000;
<br>
<br>(ii) an amount equal to (I) 90 percent of the amount received and used under this part in the second preceding fiscal year by eligible institutions offering comparable programs of instruction, divided by (II) the number of students enrolled at such comparable institutions in such fiscal year, multiplied by (III) the number of students enrolled at the applicant institution in such fiscal year; or
<br>
<br>(iii) 90 percent of the institution's allocation under this part for the preceding fiscal year.
<br>
<br>(C) Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph, the Secretary shall allocate to each eligible institution which—
<br>
<br>(i) was a first-time participant in the program in fiscal year 2000 or any subsequent fiscal year, and
<br>
<br>(ii) received a larger amount under this subsection in the second year of participation,
<br>
<br>an amount equal to 90 percent of the amount it received under this subsection in its second year of participation.
<br>
<br>(D) For any fiscal year after a fiscal year in which an institution receives an allocation under subparagraph (A), (B), or (C), the Secretary shall allocate to such institution an amount equal to the product of—
<br>
<br>(i) the amount determined under subparagraph (A), (B), or (C), multiplied by
<br>
<br>(ii) the institution's default penalty, as determined under subsection (e),
<br>
<br>except that if the institution has a cohort default rate in excess of the applicable maximum cohort default rate under subsection (f), the institution may not receive an allocation under this paragraph.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) If the amount appropriated for any fiscal year is less than the amount required to be allocated to all institutions under paragraph (1) of this subsection, then the amount of the allocation to each such institution shall be ratably reduced.
<br>
<br>(B) If the amount appropriated for any fiscal year is more than the amount required to be allocated to all institutions under paragraph (1) but less than the amount required to be allocated to all institutions under paragraph (2), then—
<br>
<br>(i) the Secretary shall allot the amount required to be allocated to all institutions under paragraph (1), and
<br>
<br>(ii) the amount of the allocation to each institution under paragraph (2) shall be ratably reduced.
<br>
<br>(C) If additional amounts are appropriated for any such fiscal year, such reduced amounts shall be increased on the same basis as they were reduced (until the amount allocated equals the amount required to be allocated under paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection).
<br>(b) Allocation of excess based on share of excess eligible amounts
<br>
<br>(1) From the remainder of the amount appropriated pursuant to section 1087aa(b) 1 of this title after making the allocations required by subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall allocate to each eligible institution which has an excess eligible amount an amount which bears the same ratio to such remainder as such excess eligible amount bears to the sum of the excess eligible amounts of all such eligible institutions (having such excess eligible amounts).
<br>
<br>(2) For any eligible institution, the excess eligible amount is the amount, if any, by which—
<br>
<br>(A)(i) that institution's eligible amount (as determined under paragraph (3)), divided by (ii) the sum of the eligible amounts of all institutions (as so determined), multiplied by (iii) the amount appropriated pursuant to section 1087aa(b) 1 of this title for the fiscal year; exceeds
<br>
<br>(B) the amount required to be allocated to that institution under subsection (a),
<br>
<br>except that an eligible institution which has a cohort default rate in excess of the applicable maximum cohort default rate under subsection (f) may not receive an allocation under this paragraph.
<br>
<br>(3) For any eligible institution, the eligible amount of that institution is equal to—
<br>
<br>(A) the amount of the institution's self-help need, as determined under subsection (c); minus
<br>
<br>(B) the institution's anticipated collections; multiplied by
<br>
<br>(C) the institution's default penalty, as determined under subsection (e);
<br>
<br>except that, if the institution has a cohort default rate in excess of the applicable maximum cohort default rate under subsection (f), the eligible amount of that institution is zero.
<br>(c) Determination of institution's self-help need
<br>
<br>(1) The amount of an institution's self-help need is equal to the sum of the self-help need of the institution's eligible undergraduate students and the self-help need of the institution's eligible graduate and professional students.
<br>
<br>(2) To determine the self-help need of an institution's eligible undergraduate students, the Secretary shall—
<br>
<br>(A) establish various income categories for dependent and independent undergraduate students;
<br>
<br>(B) establish an expected family contribution for each income category of dependent and independent undergraduate students, determined on the basis of the average expected family contribution (computed in accordance with part F of this subchapter) of a representative sample within each income category for the second preceding fiscal year;
<br>
<br>(C) compute 25 percent of the average cost of attendance for all undergraduate students;
<br>
<br>(D) multiply the number of eligible dependent students in each income category by the lesser of—
<br>
<br>(i) 25 percent of the average cost of attendance for all undergraduate students determined under subparagraph (C); or
<br>
<br>(ii) the average cost of attendance for all undergraduate students minus the expected family contribution determined under subparagraph (B) for that income category, except that the amount computed by such subtraction shall not be less than zero;
<br>
<br>(E) add the amounts determined under subparagraph (D) for each income category of dependent students;
<br>
<br>(F) multiply the number of eligible independent students in each income category by the lesser of—
<br>
<br>(i) 25 percent of the average cost of attendance for all undergraduate students determined under subparagraph (C); or
<br>
<br>(ii) the average cost of attendance for all undergraduate students minus the expected family contribution determined under subparagraph (B) for that income category, except that the amount computed by such subtraction for any income category shall not be less than zero;
<br>
<br>(G) add the amounts determined under subparagraph (F) for each income category of independent students; and
<br>
<br>(H) add the amounts determined under subparagraphs (E) and (G).
<br>
<br>(3) To determine the self-help need of an institution's eligible graduate and professional students, the Secretary shall—
<br>
<br>(A) establish various income categories for graduate and professional students;
<br>
<br>(B) establish an expected family contribution for each income category of graduate and professional students, determined on the basis of the average expected family contribution (computed in accordance with part F of this subchapter) of a representative sample within each income category for the second preceding fiscal year;
<br>
<br>(C) determine the average cost of attendance for all graduate and professional students;
<br>
<br>(D) subtract from the average cost of attendance for all graduate and professional students (determined under subparagraph (C)), the expected family contribution (determined under subparagraph (B)) for each income category, except that the amount computed by such subtraction for any income category shall not be less than zero;
<br>
<br>(E) multiply the amounts determined under subparagraph (D) by the number of eligible students in each category;
<br>
<br>(F) add the amounts determined under subparagraph (E) for each income category.
<br>
<br>(4)(A) For purposes of paragraphs (2) and (3), the term "average cost of attendance" means the average of the attendance costs for undergraduate students and for graduate and professional students, which shall include (i) tuition and fees determined in accordance with subparagraph (B), (ii) standard living expenses determined in accordance with subparagraph (C), and (iii) books and supplies determined in accordance with subparagraph (D).
<br>
<br>(B) The average undergraduate and graduate and professional tuition and fees described in subparagraph (A)(i) shall be computed on the basis of information reported by the institution to the Secretary, which shall include (i) total revenue received by the institution from undergraduate and graduate tuition and fees for the second year preceding the year for which it is applying for an allocation, and (ii) the institution's enrollment for such second preceding year.
<br>
<br>(C) The standard living expense described in subparagraph (A)(ii) is equal to 150 percent of the difference between the income protection allowance for a family of five with one in college and the income protection allowance for a family of six with one in college for a single independent student.
<br>
<br>(D) The allowance for books and supplies described in subparagraph (A)(iii) is equal to $600.
<br>(d) Anticipated collections
<br>
<br>(1) An institution's anticipated collections are equal to the amount which was collected during the second year preceding the beginning of the award period, multiplied by 1.21.
<br>
<br>(2) The Secretary shall establish an appeals process by which the anticipated collections required in paragraph (1) may be waived for institutions with low cohort default rates in the program assisted under this part.
<br>(e) Default penalties
<br>(1) Years preceding fiscal year 2000
<br>
<br>For any fiscal year preceding fiscal year 2000, any institution with a cohort default rate that—
<br>
<br>(A) equals or exceeds 15 percent, shall establish a default reduction plan pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary, except that such plan shall not be required with respect to an institution that has a default rate of less than 20 percent and that has less than 100 students who have loans under this part in such academic year;
<br>
<br>(B) equals or exceeds 20 percent, but is less than 25 percent, shall have a default penalty of 0.9;
<br>
<br>(C) equals or exceeds 25 percent, but is less than 30 percent, shall have a default penalty of 0.7; and
<br>
<br>(D) equals or exceeds 30 percent shall have a default penalty of zero.
<br>(2) Years following fiscal year 2000
<br>
<br>For fiscal year 2000 and any succeeding fiscal year, any institution with a cohort default rate (as defined under subsection (g)) that equals or exceeds 25 percent shall have a default penalty of zero.
<br>(3) Ineligibility
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>For fiscal year 2000 and any succeeding fiscal year, any institution with a cohort default rate (as defined in subsection (g)) that equals or exceeds 50 percent for each of the 3 most recent years for which data are available shall not be eligible to participate in a program under this part for the fiscal year for which the determination is made and the 2 succeeding fiscal years, unless, within 30 days of receiving notification from the Secretary of the loss of eligibility under this paragraph, the institution appeals the loss of eligibility to the Secretary. The Secretary shall issue a decision on any such appeal within 45 days after the submission of the appeal. Such decision may permit the institution to continue to participate in a program under this part if—
<br>
<br>(i) the institution demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the calculation of the institution's cohort default rate is not accurate, and that recalculation would reduce the institution's cohort default rate for any of the 3 fiscal years below 50 percent; or
<br>
<br>(ii) there are, in the judgment of the Secretary, such a small number of borrowers entering repayment that the application of this subparagraph would be inequitable.
<br>(B) Continued participation
<br>
<br>During an appeal under subparagraph (A), the Secretary may permit the institution to continue to participate in a program under this part.
<br>(C) Return of funds
<br>
<br>Within 90 days after the date of any termination pursuant to subparagraph (A), or the conclusion of any appeal pursuant to subparagraph (B), whichever is later, the balance of the student loan fund established under this part by the institution that is the subject of the termination shall be distributed as follows:
<br>
<br>(i) The Secretary shall first be paid an amount which bears the same ratio to such balance (as of the date of such distribution) as the total amount of Federal capital contributions to such fund by the Secretary under this part bears to the sum of such Federal capital contributions and the capital contributions to such fund made by the institution.
<br>
<br>(ii) The remainder of such student loan fund shall be paid to the institution.
<br>(D) Use of returned funds
<br>
<br>Any funds returned to the Secretary under this paragraph shall be reallocated to institutions of higher education pursuant to subsection (i).
<br>(E) Definition
<br>
<br>For the purposes of subparagraph (A), the term "loss of eligibility" shall be defined as the mandatory liquidation of an institution's student loan fund, and assignment of the institution's outstanding loan portfolio to the Secretary.
<br>(f) Applicable maximum cohort default rate
<br>(1) Award years prior to 2000
<br>
<br>For award years prior to award year 2000, the applicable maximum cohort default rate is 30 percent.
<br>(2) Award year 2000 and succeeding award years
<br>
<br>For award year 2000 and subsequent years, the applicable maximum cohort default rate is 25 percent.
<br>(g) "Cohort default rate" defined
<br>
<br>(1)(A) The term "cohort default rate" means, for any award year in which 30 or more current and former students at the institution enter repayment on loans under this part (received for attendance at the institution), the percentage of those current and former students who enter repayment on such loans (received for attendance at that institution) in that award year who default before the end of the following award year.
<br>
<br>(B) For any award year in which less than 30 of the institution's current and former students enter repayment, the term "cohort default rate" means the percentage of such current and former students who entered repayment on such loans in any of the three most recent award years and who default before the end of the award year immediately following the year in which they entered repayment.
<br>
<br>(C) A loan on which a payment is made by the institution of higher education, its owner, agency, contractor, employee, or any other entity or individual affiliated with such institution, in order to avoid default by the borrower, is considered as in default for the purposes of this subsection.
<br>
<br>(D) In the case of a student who has attended and borrowed at more than one school, the student (and his or her subsequent repayment or default) is attributed to the school for attendance at which the student received the loan that entered repayment in the award year.
<br>
<br>(E) In determining the number of students who default before the end of such award year, the institution, in calculating the cohort default rate, shall exclude—
<br>
<br>(i) any loan on which the borrower has, after the time periods specified in paragraph (2)—
<br>
<br>(I) voluntarily made 6 consecutive payments;
<br>
<br>(II) voluntarily made all payments currently due;
<br>
<br>(III) repaid in full the amount due on the loan; or
<br>
<br>(IV) received a deferment or forbearance, based on a condition that began prior to such time periods;
<br>
<br>(ii) any loan which has, after the time periods specified in paragraph (2), been rehabilitated or canceled; and
<br>
<br>(iii) any other loan that the Secretary determines should be excluded from such determination.
<br>
<br>(F) The Secretary shall prescribe regulations designed to prevent an institution from evading the application to that institution of a cohort default rate determination under this subsection through the use of such measures as branching, consolidation, change of ownership or control or other means as determined by the Secretary.
<br>
<br>(2) For purposes of calculating the cohort default rate under this subsection, a loan shall be considered to be in default—
<br>
<br>(A) 240 days (in the case of a loan repayable monthly), or
<br>
<br>(B) 270 days (in the case of a loan repayable quarterly),
<br>
<br>after the borrower fails to make an installment payment when due or to comply with other terms of the promissory note.
<br>(h) Filing deadlines
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall, from time to time, set dates before which institutions must file applications for allocations under this part.
<br>(i) Reallocation of excess allocations
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>(A) If an institution of higher education returns to the Secretary any portion of the sums allocated to such institution under this section for any fiscal year, the Secretary shall reallocate 80 percent of such returned portions to participating institutions in an amount not to exceed such participating institution's excess eligible amounts as determined under paragraph (2).
<br>
<br>(B) For the purpose of this subsection, the term "participating institution" means an institution of higher education that—
<br>
<br>(i) was a participant in the program assisted under this part in fiscal year 1999; and
<br>
<br>(ii) did not receive an allocation under subsection (a) in the fiscal year for which the reallocation determination is made.
<br>(2) Excess eligible amount
<br>
<br>For any participating institution, the excess eligible amount is the amount, if any, by which—
<br>
<br>(A)(i) that institution's eligible amount (as determined under subsection (b)(3)), divided by (ii) the sum of the eligible amounts of all participating institutions (as determined under paragraph (3)), multiplied by (iii) the amount of funds available for reallocation under this subsection; exceeds
<br>
<br>(B) the amount required to be allocated to that institution under subsection (b).
<br>(3) Remainder
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall reallocate the remainder of such returned portions in accordance with regulations of the Secretary.
<br>(4) Allocation reductions
<br>
<br>If under paragraph (1) of this subsection an institution returns more than 10 percent of its allocation, the institution's allocation for the next fiscal year shall be reduced by the amount returned. The Secretary may waive this paragraph for a specific institution if the Secretary finds that enforcing it is contrary to the interest of the program.

<br>(ii) $8,000, in the case of a graduate or professional student (as defined in regulations issued by the Secretary).
<br>
<br>(B) Except as provided in paragraph (4), the aggregate unpaid principal amount for all loans made to a student by institutions of higher education from loan funds established pursuant to agreements under this part may not exceed—
<br>
<br>(i) $60,000, in the case of any graduate or professional student (as defined by regulations issued by the Secretary, and including any loans from such funds made to such person before such person became a graduate or professional student);
<br>
<br>(ii) $27,500, in the case of a student who has successfully completed 2 years of a program of education leading to a bachelor's degree but who has not completed the work necessary for such a degree (determined under regulations issued by the Secretary), and including any loans from such funds made to such person before such person became such a student; and
<br>
<br>(iii) $11,000, in the case of any other student.
<br>
<br>(3) Regulations of the Secretary under paragraph (1) shall be designed to prevent the impairment of the capital student loan funds to the maximum extent practicable and with a view toward the objective of enabling the student to complete his course of study.
<br>
<br>(4) In the case of a program of study abroad that is approved for credit by the home institution at which a student is enrolled and that has reasonable costs in excess of the home institution's budget, the annual and aggregate loan limits for the student may exceed the amounts described in paragraphs (2)(A) and (2)(B) by 20 percent.
<br>(b) Demonstration of need and eligibility required
<br>
<br>(1) A loan from a student loan fund assisted under this part may be made only to a student who demonstrates financial need in accordance with part F of this subchapter, who meets the requirements of section 1091 of this title, and who provides the institution with the student's drivers license number, if any, at the time of application for the loan. A student who is in default on a loan under this part shall not be eligible for an additional loan under this part unless such loan meets one of the conditions for exclusion under section 1087bb(g)(1)(E) of this title.

<br>
<br>(iv) if the borrower is determined by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to be unemployable due to a service-connected disability;

<br>
<br>(3)(A) The Secretary is authorized, when good cause is shown, to extend, in accordance with regulations, the 10-year maximum repayment period provided for in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) with respect to individual loans.
<br>
<br>(B) Pursuant to uniform criteria established by the Secretary, the repayment period for any student borrower who during the repayment period is a low-income individual may be extended for a period not to exceed 10 years and the repayment schedule may be adjusted to reflect the income of that individual.
<br>
<br>(4) The repayment period for a loan made under this part shall begin on the day immediately following the expiration of the period, specified in paragraph (1)(A), after the student ceases to carry the required academic workload, unless the borrower requests and is granted a repayment schedule that provides for repayment to commence at an earlier point in time, and shall exclude any period of authorized deferment, forbearance, or cancellation.
<br>

Such period of exclusion shall include the period necessary to resume enrollment at the borrower's next available regular enrollment period.
<br>(d) Availability of loan fund to all eligible students
<br>
<br>An agreement under this part for payment of Federal capital contributions shall include provisions designed to make loans from the student loan fund established pursuant to such agreement reasonably available (to the extent of the available funds in such fund) to all eligible students in such institutions in need thereof.
<br>(e) Forbearance
<br>
<br>(1) The Secretary shall ensure that, as documented in accordance with paragraph (2), an institution of higher education shall grant a borrower forbearance of principal and interest or principal only, renewable at 12-month intervals for a period not to exceed 3 years, on such terms as are otherwise consistent with the regulations issued by the Secretary and agreed upon in writing by the parties to the loan, if—
<br>
<br>(A) the borrower's debt burden equals or exceeds 20 percent of such borrower's gross income;
<br>
<br>(B) the institution determines that the borrower should qualify for forbearance for other reasons; or
<br>
<br>(C) the borrower is eligible for interest payments to be made on such loan for service in the Armed Forces under section 2174 of title 10 and, pursuant to that eligibility, the interest on such loan is being paid under subsection (j), except that the form of a forbearance under this paragraph shall be a temporary cessation of all payments on the loan other than payments of interest on the loan that are made under subsection (j).
<br>
<br>(2) For the purpose of paragraph (1), the terms of forbearance agreed to by the parties shall be documented by—
<br>
<br>(A) confirming the agreement of the borrower by notice to the borrower from the institution of higher education; and
<br>
<br>(B) recording the terms in the borrower's file.
<br>(f) Special repayment rule authority
<br>
<br>(1) Subject to such restrictions as the Secretary may prescribe to protect the interest of the United States, in order to encourage repayment of loans made under this part which are in default, the Secretary may, in the agreement entered into under this part, authorize an institution of higher education to compromise on the repayment of such defaulted loans in accordance with paragraph (2). The Federal share of the compromise repayment shall bear the same relation to the institution's share of such compromise repayment as the Federal capital contribution to the institution's loan fund under this part bears to the institution's capital contribution to such fund.
<br>
<br>(2) No compromise repayment of a defaulted loan as authorized by paragraph (1) may be made unless the student borrower pays—
<br>
<br>(A) 90 percent of the loan under this part;
<br>
<br>(B) the interest due on such loan; and
<br>
<br>(C) any collection fees due on such loan;
<br>
<br>in a lump sum payment.
<br>(g) Discharge
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>If a student borrower who received a loan made under this part on or after January 1, 1986, is unable to complete the program in which such student is enrolled due to the closure of the institution, then the Secretary shall discharge the borrower's liability on the loan (including the interest and collection fees) and shall subsequently pursue any claim available to such borrower against the institution and the institution's affiliates and principals, or settle the loan obligation pursuant to the financial responsibility standards described in section 1099c(c) of this title.
<br>(2) Assignment
<br>
<br>A borrower whose loan has been discharged pursuant to this subsection shall be deemed to have assigned to the United States the right to a loan refund in an amount that does not exceed the amount discharged against the institution and the institution's affiliates and principals.
<br>(3) Eligibility for additional assistance
<br>
<br>The period during which a student was unable to complete a course of study due to the closing of the institution shall not be considered for purposes of calculating the student's period of eligibility for additional assistance under this subchapter.
<br>(4) Special rule
<br>
<br>A borrower whose loan has been discharged pursuant to this subsection shall not be precluded, because of that discharge, from receiving additional grant, loan, or work assistance under this subchapter for which the borrower would be otherwise eligible (but for the default on the discharged loan). The amount discharged under this subsection shall be treated as an amount canceled under section 1087ee(a) of this title.
<br>(5) Reporting
<br>
<br>The Secretary or institution, as the case may be, shall report to consumer reporting agencies with respect to loans that have been discharged pursuant to this subsection.
<br>(h) Rehabilitation of loans
<br>(1) Rehabilitation
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>If the borrower of a loan made under this part who has defaulted on the loan makes 9 on-time, consecutive, monthly payments of amounts owed on the loan, as determined by the institution, or by the Secretary in the case of a loan held by the Secretary, the loan shall be considered rehabilitated, and the institution that made that loan (or the Secretary, in the case of a loan held by the Secretary) shall request that any consumer reporting agency to which the default was reported remove the default from the borrower's credit history.
<br>(B) Comparable conditions
<br>
<br>As long as the borrower continues to make scheduled repayments on a loan rehabilitated under this paragraph, the rehabilitated loan shall be subject to the same terms and conditions, and qualify for the same benefits and privileges, as other loans made under this part.
<br>(C) Additional assistance
<br>
<br>The borrower of a rehabilitated loan shall not be precluded by section 1091 of this title from receiving additional grant, loan, or work assistance under this subchapter (for which the borrower is otherwise eligible) on the basis of defaulting on the loan prior to such rehabilitation.
<br>(D) Limitations
<br>
<br>A borrower only once may obtain the benefit of this paragraph with respect to rehabilitating a loan under this part.
<br>(2) Restoration of eligibility
<br>
<br>If the borrower of a loan made under this part who has defaulted on that loan makes 6 ontime, consecutive, monthly payments of amounts owed on such loan, the borrower's eligibility for grant, loan, or work assistance under this subchapter shall be restored to the extent that the borrower is otherwise eligible. A borrower only once may obtain the benefit of this paragraph with respect to restored eligibility.
<br>(i) Incentive repayment program
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Each institution of higher education may establish, with the approval of the Secretary, an incentive repayment program designed to reduce default and to replenish student loan funds established under this part. Each such incentive repayment program may—
<br>
<br>(A) offer a reduction of the interest rate on a loan on which the borrower has made 48 consecutive, monthly repayments, but in no event may the rate be reduced by more than 1 percent;
<br>
<br>(B) provide for a discount on the balance owed on a loan on which the borrower pays the principal and interest in full prior to the end of the applicable repayment period, but in no event may the discount exceed 5 percent of the unpaid principal balance due on the loan at the time the early repayment is made; and
<br>
<br>(C) include such other incentive repayment options as the institution determines will carry out the objectives of this subsection.
<br>(2) Limitation
<br>
<br>No incentive repayment option under an incentive repayment program authorized by this subsection may be paid for with Federal funds, including any Federal funds from the student loan fund, or with institutional funds from the student loan fund.
<br>(j) Armed Forces and NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps student loan interest payment programs
<br>(1) Authority
<br>
<br>Using funds received by transfer to the Secretary under section 2174 of title 10 or section 3078 of title 33 for the payment of interest on a loan made under this part to a member of the Armed Forces or an officer in the commissioned officer corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, respectively, the Secretary shall pay the interest on the loan as due for a period not in excess of 36 consecutive months. The Secretary may not pay interest on such a loan out of any funds other than funds that have been so transferred.
<br>(2) Forbearance
<br>
<br>During the period in which the Secretary is making payments on a loan under paragraph (1), the institution of higher education shall grant the borrower forbearance in accordance with subsection (e)(1)(C).
<br>(k) Additional safeguards
<br>
<br>The Secretary may develop such additional safeguards as the Secretary determines necessary to prevent fraud and abuse in the cancellation of liability under subsection (c)(1)(F). Notwithstanding subsection (c)(1)(F), the Secretary may promulgate regulations to resume collection on loans cancelled under subsection (c)(1)(F) in any case in which—
