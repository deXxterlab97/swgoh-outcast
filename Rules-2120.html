<br>(1) Filing of informational tariff
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Each provider of operator services shall file, within 90 days after October 17, 1990, and shall maintain, update regularly, and keep open for public inspection, an informational tariff specifying rates, terms, and conditions, and including commissions, surcharges, any fees which are collected from consumers, and reasonable estimates of the amount of traffic priced at each rate, with respect to calls for which operator services are provided. Any changes in such rates, terms, or conditions shall be filed no later than the first day on which the changed rates, terms, or conditions are in effect.
<br>(B) Waiver authority
<br>
<br>The Commission may, after 4 years following October 17, 1990, waive the requirements of this paragraph only if—
<br>
<br>(i) the findings and conclusions of the Commission in the final report issued under paragraph (3)(B)(iii) state that the regulatory objectives specified in subsection (d)(1)(A) and (B) have been achieved; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the Commission determines that such waiver will not adversely affect the continued achievement of such regulatory objectives.
<br>(2) Review of informational tariffs
<br>
<br>If the rates and charges filed by any provider of operator services under paragraph (1) appear upon review by the Commission to be unjust or unreasonable, the Commission may require such provider of operator services to do either or both of the following:
<br>
<br>(A) demonstrate that its rates and charges are just and reasonable, and
<br>
<br>(B) announce that its rates are available on request at the beginning of each call.
<br>(3) Proceeding required
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Within 60 days after October 17, 1990, the Commission shall initiate a proceeding to determine whether the regulatory objectives specified in subsection (d)(1)(A) and (B) are being achieved. The proceeding shall—
<br>
<br>(i) monitor operator service rates;
<br>
<br>(ii) determine the extent to which offerings made by providers of operator services are improvements, in terms of service quality, price, innovation, and other factors, over those available before the entry of new providers of operator services into the market;
<br>
<br>(iii) report on (in the aggregate and by individual provider) operator service rates, incidence of service complaints, and service offerings;
<br>
<br>(iv) consider the effect that commissions and surcharges, billing and validation costs, and other costs of doing business have on the overall rates charged to consumers; and
<br>
<br>(v) monitor compliance with the provisions of this section, including the periodic placement of telephone calls from aggregator locations.
<br>(B) Reports
<br>

<br>
<br>(ii) Not later than 11 months after the commencement of such proceeding, the Commission shall report to the Congress on its interim findings as a result of the proceeding.
<br>
<br>(iii) Not later than 23 months after the commencement of such proceeding, the Commission shall submit a final report to the Congress on its findings and conclusions.
<br>(4) Implementing regulations
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Unless the Commission makes the determination described in subparagraph (B), the Commission shall, within 180 days after submission of the report required under paragraph (3)(B)(iii), complete a rulemaking proceeding pursuant to this subchapter to establish regulations for implementing the requirements of this subchapter (and paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection) that rates and charges for operator services be just and reasonable. Such regulations shall include limitations on the amount of commissions or any other compensation given to aggregators by providers of operator service.
<br>(B) Limitation
<br>
<br>The requirement of subparagraph (A) shall not apply if, on the basis of the proceeding under paragraph (3)(A), the Commission makes (and includes in the report required by paragraph (3)(B)(iii)) a factual determination that market forces are securing rates and charges that are just and reasonable, as evidenced by rate levels, costs, complaints, service quality, and other relevant factors.
<br>(i) Statutory construction
<br>
<br>Nothing in this section shall be construed to alter the obligations, powers, or duties of common carriers or the Commission under the other sections of this chapter.

<br>Statutory Notes and Related Subsidiaries
<br>Congressional Findings
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 101–435, §2, Oct. 17, 1990, 104 Stat. 986, provided that: "The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>"(1) the divestiture of AT&T and decisions allowing open entry for competitors in the telephone marketplace produced a variety of new services and many new providers of existing telephone services;
<br>
<br>"(2) the growth of competition in the telecommunications market makes it essential to ensure that safeguards are in place to assure fairness for consumers and service providers alike;
<br>
<br>"(3) a variety of providers of operator services now compete to win contracts to provide operator services to hotels, hospitals, airports, and other aggregators of telephone business from consumers;
<br>
<br>"(4) the mere existence of a variety of service providers in the operator services marketplace is significant in making that market competitive only when consumers are able to make informed choices from among those service providers;
<br>
<br>"(5) however, often consumers have no choices in selecting a provider of operator services, and often attempts by consumers to reach their preferred long distance carrier by using a telephone billing card, credit card, or prearranged access code number are blocked;
<br>
<br>"(6) a number of State regulatory authorities have taken action to protect consumers using intrastate operator services;
<br>
<br>"(7) from January 1988 through February 1990, the Federal Communications Commission received over 4,000 complaints from consumers about operator services;
<br>
<br>"(8) those consumers have complained that they are denied access to the interexchange carrier of their choice, that they are deceived about the identity of the company providing operator services for their calls and the rates being charged, that they lack information on what they can do to complain about unfair treatment by an operator service provider, and that they are, accordingly, being deprived of the free choice essential to the operation of a competitive market;
<br>
<br>"(9) the Commission has testified that its actions have been insufficient to correct the problems in the operator services industry to date; and
<br>
<br>"(10) a combination of industry self-regulation and government regulation is required to ensure that competitive operator services are provided in a fair and reasonable manner."

<br>
<br> except that this clause shall not apply in the case of an unsolicited advertisement that is sent based on an established business relationship with the recipient that was in existence before July 9, 2005, if the sender possessed the facsimile machine number of the recipient before July 9, 2005; and
<br>
<br>(iii) the unsolicited advertisement contains a notice meeting the requirements under paragraph (2)(D),
<br>

<br>
<br>(D) to use an automatic telephone dialing system in such a way that two or more telephone lines of a multi-line business are engaged simultaneously.
<br>(2) Regulations; exemptions and other provisions
<br>
<br>The Commission shall prescribe regulations to implement the requirements of this subsection. In implementing the requirements of this subsection, the Commission—
<br>
<br>(A) shall consider prescribing regulations to allow businesses to avoid receiving calls made using an artificial or prerecorded voice to which they have not given their prior express consent;
<br>
<br>(B) may, by rule or order, exempt from the requirements of paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, subject to such conditions as the Commission may prescribe—
<br>
<br>(i) calls that are not made for a commercial purpose; and
<br>
<br>(ii) such classes or categories of calls made for commercial purposes as the Commission determines—
<br>
<br>(I) will not adversely affect the privacy rights that this section is intended to protect; and
<br>
<br>(II) do not include the transmission of any unsolicited advertisement;
<br>
<br>(C) may, by rule or order, exempt from the requirements of paragraph (1)(A)(iii) of this subsection calls to a telephone number assigned to a cellular telephone service that are not charged to the called party, subject to such conditions as the Commission may prescribe as necessary in the interest of the privacy rights this section is intended to protect;
<br>
<br>(D) shall provide that a notice contained in an unsolicited advertisement complies with the requirements under this subparagraph only if—
<br>
<br>(i) the notice is clear and conspicuous and on the first page of the unsolicited advertisement;
<br>
<br>(ii) the notice states that the recipient may make a request to the sender of the unsolicited advertisement not to send any future unsolicited advertisements to a telephone facsimile machine or machines and that failure to comply, within the shortest reasonable time, as determined by the Commission, with such a request meeting the requirements under subparagraph (E) is unlawful;
<br>
<br>(iii) the notice sets forth the requirements for a request under subparagraph (E);
<br>
<br>(iv) the notice includes—
<br>
<br>(I) a domestic contact telephone and facsimile machine number for the recipient to transmit such a request to the sender; and
<br>
<br>(II) a cost-free mechanism for a recipient to transmit a request pursuant to such notice to the sender of the unsolicited advertisement; the Commission shall by rule require the sender to provide such a mechanism and may, in the discretion of the Commission and subject to such conditions as the Commission may prescribe, exempt certain classes of small business senders, but only if the Commission determines that the costs to such class are unduly burdensome given the revenues generated by such small businesses;
<br>
<br>(v) the telephone and facsimile machine numbers and the cost-free mechanism set forth pursuant to clause (iv) permit an individual or business to make such a request at any time on any day of the week; and
<br>
<br>(vi) the notice complies with the requirements of subsection (d);
<br>
<br>(E) shall provide, by rule, that a request not to send future unsolicited advertisements to a telephone facsimile machine complies with the requirements under this subparagraph only if—
<br>
<br>(i) the request identifies the telephone number or numbers of the telephone facsimile machine or machines to which the request relates;
<br>
<br>(ii) the request is made to the telephone or facsimile number of the sender of such an unsolicited advertisement provided pursuant to subparagraph (D)(iv) or by any other method of communication as determined by the Commission; and
<br>
<br>(iii) the person making the request has not, subsequent to such request, provided express invitation or permission to the sender, in writing or otherwise, to send such advertisements to such person at such telephone facsimile machine;
<br>
<br>(F) may, in the discretion of the Commission and subject to such conditions as the Commission may prescribe, allow professional or trade associations that are tax-exempt nonprofit organizations to send unsolicited advertisements to their members in furtherance of the association's tax-exempt purpose that do not contain the notice required by paragraph (1)(C)(iii), except that the Commission may take action under this subparagraph only—
<br>
<br>(i) by regulation issued after public notice and opportunity for public comment; and
<br>
<br>(ii) if the Commission determines that such notice required by paragraph (1)(C)(iii) is not necessary to protect the ability of the members of such associations to stop such associations from sending any future unsolicited advertisements;
<br>
<br>(G)(i) may, consistent with clause (ii), limit the duration of the existence of an established business relationship, however, before establishing any such limits, the Commission shall—
<br>
<br>(I) determine whether the existence of the exception under paragraph (1)(C) relating to an established business relationship has resulted in a significant number of complaints to the Commission regarding the sending of unsolicited advertisements to telephone facsimile machines;
<br>
<br>(II) determine whether a significant number of any such complaints involve unsolicited advertisements that were sent on the basis of an established business relationship that was longer in duration than the Commission believes is consistent with the reasonable expectations of consumers;
<br>
<br>(III) evaluate the costs to senders of demonstrating the existence of an established business relationship within a specified period of time and the benefits to recipients of establishing a limitation on such established business relationship; and
<br>
<br>(IV) determine whether with respect to small businesses, the costs would not be unduly burdensome; and
<br>
<br>(ii) may not commence a proceeding to determine whether to limit the duration of the existence of an established business relationship before the expiration of the 3-month period that begins on July 9, 2005;
<br>
<br>(H) may restrict or limit the number and duration of calls made to a telephone number assigned to a cellular telephone service to collect a debt owed to or guaranteed by the United States; and
<br>
<br>(I) shall ensure that any exemption under subparagraph (B) or (C) contains requirements for calls made in reliance on the exemption with respect to—
<br>
<br>(i) the classes of parties that may make such calls;
<br>
<br>(ii) the classes of parties that may be called; and
<br>
<br>(iii) the number of such calls that a calling party may make to a particular called party.
<br>(3) Private right of action
<br>
<br>A person or entity may, if otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of a State, bring in an appropriate court of that State—
<br>
<br>(A) an action based on a violation of this subsection or the regulations prescribed under this subsection to enjoin such violation,
<br>
<br>(B) an action to recover for actual monetary loss from such a violation, or to receive $500 in damages for each such violation, whichever is greater, or
<br>
<br>(C) both such actions.
<br>
<br>If the court finds that the defendant willfully or knowingly violated this subsection or the regulations prescribed under this subsection, the court may, in its discretion, increase the amount of the award to an amount equal to not more than 3 times the amount available under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.
<br>(4) Civil forfeiture
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Any person that is determined by the Commission, in accordance with paragraph (3) or (4) of section 503(b) of this title, to have violated this subsection shall be liable to the United States for a forfeiture penalty pursuant to section 503(b)(1) of this title. Paragraph (5) of section 503(b) of this title shall not apply in the case of a violation of this subsection. A forfeiture penalty under this subparagraph shall be in addition to any other penalty provided for by this chapter. The amount of the forfeiture penalty determined under this subparagraph shall be determined in accordance with subparagraphs (A) through (F) of section 503(b)(2) of this title.
<br>(B) Violation with intent
<br>
<br>Any person that is determined by the Commission, in accordance with paragraph (3) or (4) of section 503(b) of this title, to have violated this subsection with the intent to cause such violation shall be liable to the United States for a forfeiture penalty pursuant to section 503(b)(1) of this title. Paragraph (5) of section 503(b) of this title shall not apply in the case of a violation of this subsection. A forfeiture penalty under this subparagraph shall be in addition to any other penalty provided for by this chapter. The amount of the forfeiture penalty determined under this subparagraph shall be equal to an amount determined in accordance with subparagraphs (A) through (F) of section 503(b)(2) of this title plus an additional penalty not to exceed $10,000.
<br>(C) Recovery
<br>
<br>Any forfeiture penalty determined under subparagraph (A) or (B) shall be recoverable under section 504(a) of this title.
<br>(D) Procedure
<br>
<br>No forfeiture liability shall be determined under subparagraph (A) or (B) against any person unless such person receives the notice required by section 503(b)(3) of this title or section 503(b)(4) of this title.
<br>(E) Statute of limitations
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding paragraph (6) of section 503(b) of this title, no forfeiture penalty shall be determined or imposed against any person—
<br>
<br>(i) under subparagraph (A) if the violation charged occurred more than 1 year prior to the date of issuance of the required notice or notice of apparent liability; or
<br>
<br>(ii) under subparagraph (B) if the violation charged occurred more than 4 years prior to the date of issuance of the required notice or notice of apparent liability.
<br>(F) Rule of construction
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the Commission may not determine or impose a forfeiture penalty on a person under both subparagraphs (A) and (B) based on the same conduct.
<br>(c) Protection of subscriber privacy rights
<br>(1) Rulemaking proceeding required
<br>
<br>Within 120 days after December 20, 1991, the Commission shall initiate a rulemaking proceeding concerning the need to protect residential telephone subscribers' privacy rights to avoid receiving telephone solicitations to which they object. The proceeding shall—
<br>
<br>(A) compare and evaluate alternative methods and procedures (including the use of electronic databases, telephone network technologies, special directory markings, industry-based or company-specific "do not call" systems, and any other alternatives, individually or in combination) for their effectiveness in protecting such privacy rights, and in terms of their cost and other advantages and disadvantages;
<br>
<br>(B) evaluate the categories of public and private entities that would have the capacity to establish and administer such methods and procedures;
<br>
<br>(C) consider whether different methods and procedures may apply for local telephone solicitations, such as local telephone solicitations of small businesses or holders of second class mail permits;
<br>
<br>(D) consider whether there is a need for additional Commission authority to further restrict telephone solicitations, including those calls exempted under subsection (a)(3) of this section, and, if such a finding is made and supported by the record, propose specific restrictions to the Congress; and
<br>
<br>(E) develop proposed regulations to implement the methods and procedures that the Commission determines are most effective and efficient to accomplish the purposes of this section.
<br>(2) Regulations
<br>
<br>Not later than 9 months after December 20, 1991, the Commission shall conclude the rulemaking proceeding initiated under paragraph (1) and shall prescribe regulations to implement methods and procedures for protecting the privacy rights described in such paragraph in an efficient, effective, and economic manner and without the imposition of any additional charge to telephone subscribers.
<br>(3) Use of database permitted
<br>
<br>The regulations required by paragraph (2) may require the establishment and operation of a single national database to compile a list of telephone numbers of residential subscribers who object to receiving telephone solicitations, and to make that compiled list and parts thereof available for purchase. If the Commission determines to require such a database, such regulations shall—
<br>
<br>(A) specify a method by which the Commission will select an entity to administer such database;
<br>
<br>(B) require each common carrier providing telephone exchange service, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Commission, to inform subscribers for telephone exchange service of the opportunity to provide notification, in accordance with regulations established under this paragraph, that such subscriber objects to receiving telephone solicitations;
<br>
<br>(C) specify the methods by which each telephone subscriber shall be informed, by the common carrier that provides local exchange service to that subscriber, of (i) the subscriber's right to give or revoke a notification of an objection under subparagraph (A), and (ii) the methods by which such right may be exercised by the subscriber;
<br>
<br>(D) specify the methods by which such objections shall be collected and added to the database;
<br>
<br>(E) prohibit any residential subscriber from being charged for giving or revoking such notification or for being included in a database compiled under this section;
<br>
<br>(F) prohibit any person from making or transmitting a telephone solicitation to the telephone number of any subscriber included in such database;
<br>
<br>(G) specify (i) the methods by which any person desiring to make or transmit telephone solicitations will obtain access to the database, by area code or local exchange prefix, as required to avoid calling the telephone numbers of subscribers included in such database; and (ii) the costs to be recovered from such persons;
<br>
<br>(H) specify the methods for recovering, from persons accessing such database, the costs involved in identifying, collecting, updating, disseminating, and selling, and other activities relating to, the operations of the database that are incurred by the entities carrying out those activities;
<br>
<br>(I) specify the frequency with which such database will be updated and specify the method by which such updating will take effect for purposes of compliance with the regulations prescribed under this subsection;
<br>
<br>(J) be designed to enable States to use the database mechanism selected by the Commission for purposes of administering or enforcing State law;
<br>
<br>(K) prohibit the use of such database for any purpose other than compliance with the requirements of this section and any such State law and specify methods for protection of the privacy rights of persons whose numbers are included in such database; and
<br>
<br>(L) require each common carrier providing services to any person for the purpose of making telephone solicitations to notify such person of the requirements of this section and the regulations thereunder.
<br>(4) Considerations required for use of database method
<br>
<br>If the Commission determines to require the database mechanism described in paragraph (3), the Commission shall—
<br>
<br>(A) in developing procedures for gaining access to the database, consider the different needs of telemarketers conducting business on a national, regional, State, or local level;
<br>
<br>(B) develop a fee schedule or price structure for recouping the cost of such database that recognizes such differences and—
<br>
<br>(i) reflect the relative costs of providing a national, regional, State, or local list of phone numbers of subscribers who object to receiving telephone solicitations;
<br>
<br>(ii) reflect the relative costs of providing such lists on paper or electronic media; and
<br>
<br>(iii) not place an unreasonable financial burden on small businesses; and
<br>
<br>(C) consider (i) whether the needs of telemarketers operating on a local basis could be met through special markings of area white pages directories, and (ii) if such directories are needed as an adjunct to database lists prepared by area code and local exchange prefix.
<br>(5) Private right of action
<br>
<br>A person who has received more than one telephone call within any 12-month period by or on behalf of the same entity in violation of the regulations prescribed under this subsection may, if otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of a State bring in an appropriate court of that State—
<br>
<br>(A) an action based on a violation of the regulations prescribed under this subsection to enjoin such violation,
<br>
<br>(B) an action to recover for actual monetary loss from such a violation, or to receive up to $500 in damages for each such violation, whichever is greater, or
<br>
<br>(C) both such actions.
<br>
<br>It shall be an affirmative defense in any action brought under this paragraph that the defendant has established and implemented, with due care, reasonable practices and procedures to effectively prevent telephone solicitations in violation of the regulations prescribed under this subsection. If the court finds that the defendant willfully or knowingly violated the regulations prescribed under this subsection, the court may, in its discretion, increase the amount of the award to an amount equal to not more than 3 times the amount available under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.
<br>(6) Relation to subsection (b)
<br>
<br>The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to permit a communication prohibited by subsection (b).
<br>(d) Technical and procedural standards
<br>(1) Prohibition
<br>
<br>It shall be unlawful for any person within the United States—
<br>

<br>Congressional Statement of Findings
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 102–243, §2, Dec. 20, 1991, 105 Stat. 2394, provided that: "The Congress finds that:
<br>
<br>"(1) The use of the telephone to market goods and services to the home and other businesses is now pervasive due to the increased use of cost-effective telemarketing techniques.
<br>
<br>"(2) Over 30,000 businesses actively telemarket goods and services to business and residential customers.
<br>
<br>"(3) More than 300,000 solicitors call more than 18,000,000 Americans every day.
<br>
<br>"(4) Total United States sales generated through telemarketing amounted to $435,000,000,000 in 1990, a more than four-fold increase since 1984.
<br>
<br>"(5) Unrestricted telemarketing, however, can be an intrusive invasion of privacy and, when an emergency or medical assistance telephone line is seized, a risk to public safety.
<br>
<br>"(6) Many consumers are outraged over the proliferation of intrusive, nuisance calls to their homes from telemarketers.
<br>
<br>"(7) Over half the States now have statutes restricting various uses of the telephone for marketing, but telemarketers can evade their prohibitions through interstate operations; therefore, Federal law is needed to control residential telemarketing practices.
<br>
<br>"(8) The Constitution does not prohibit restrictions on commercial telemarketing solicitations.
<br>
<br>"(9) Individuals' privacy rights, public safety interests, and commercial freedoms of speech and trade must be balanced in a way that protects the privacy of individuals and permits legitimate telemarketing practices.
<br>
<br>"(10) Evidence compiled by the Congress indicates that residential telephone subscribers consider automated or prerecorded telephone calls, regardless of the content or the initiator of the message, to be a nuisance and an invasion of privacy.
<br>
<br>"(11) Technologies that might allow consumers to avoid receiving such calls are not universally available, are costly, are unlikely to be enforced, or place an inordinate burden on the consumer.
<br>
<br>"(12) Banning such automated or prerecorded telephone calls to the home, except when the receiving party consents to receiving the call or when such calls are necessary in an emergency situation affecting the health and safety of the consumer, is the only effective means of protecting telephone consumers from this nuisance and privacy invasion.
<br>
<br>"(13) While the evidence presented to the Congress indicates that automated or prerecorded calls are a nuisance and an invasion of privacy, regardless of the type of call, the Federal Communications Commission should have the flexibility to design different rules for those types of automated or prerecorded calls that it finds are not considered a nuisance or invasion of privacy, or for noncommercial calls, consistent with the free speech protections embodied in the First Amendment of the Constitution.
<br>
<br>"(14) Businesses also have complained to the Congress and the Federal Communications Commission that automated or prerecorded telephone calls are a nuisance, are an invasion of privacy, and interfere with interstate commerce.
<br>
<br>"(15) The Federal Communications Commission should consider adopting reasonable restrictions on automated or prerecorded calls to businesses as well as to the home, consistent with the constitutional protections of free speech."

<br>During the time of a delay of compliance granted under subparagraph (A)(ii), the Commission shall require, pursuant to the authority of the Commission, that any provider subject to such delay shall implement an appropriate robocall mitigation program to prevent unlawful robocalls from originating on the network of the provider.
<br>(ii) Additional requirements
<br>
<br>If the consortium registered under section 13(d) identifies a provider of voice service that is subject to a delay of compliance granted under subparagraph (A)(ii) as repeatedly originating large-scale unlawful robocall campaigns, the Commission shall require such provider to take action to ensure that such provider does not continue to originate such calls.
<br>(iii) Minimization of burden
<br>
<br>The Commission shall make reasonable efforts to minimize the burden of any robocall mitigation required pursuant to clause (ii), which may include prescribing certain specific robocall mitigation practices for providers of voice service that have repeatedly originated large-scale unlawful robocall campaigns.
<br>(D) Full participation
<br>
<br>The Commission shall take reasonable measures to address any issues in an assessment under subparagraph (A)(i) and enable as promptly as reasonable full participation of all classes of providers of voice service and types of voice calls to receive the highest level of trust. Such measures shall include, without limitation, as appropriate, limiting or terminating a delay of compliance granted to a provider under subparagraph (B) if the Commission determines in such assessment that the provider is not making reasonable efforts to develop the call authentication protocol described in such subparagraph.
<br>(E) Alternative methodologies
<br>
<br>The Commission shall identify, in consultation with small providers of voice service and those in rural areas, alternative effective methodologies to protect customers from unauthenticated calls during any delay of compliance granted under subparagraph (A)(ii).
<br>(F) Revision of delay of compliance
<br>
<br>Not less frequently than annually after the first delay of compliance is granted under subparagraph (A)(ii), the Commission—
<br>
<br>(i) shall consider revising or extending any delay of compliance granted under subparagraph (A)(ii);
<br>
<br>(ii) may revise such delay of compliance; and
<br>
<br>(iii) shall issue a public notice with regard to whether such delay of compliance remains necessary, including—
<br>
<br>(I) why such delay of compliance remains necessary; and
<br>
<br>(II) when the Commission expects to achieve the goal of full participation as described in subparagraph (D).
<br>(6) No additional cost to consumers or small business customers
<br>
<br>The Commission shall prohibit providers of voice service from adding any additional line item charges to consumer or small business customer subscribers for the effective call authentication technology required under paragraph (1).
<br>(7) Accurate identification
<br>
<br>Not later than 12 months after December 30, 2019, the Commission shall issue best practices that providers of voice service may use as part of the implementation of effective call authentication frameworks under paragraph (1) to take steps to ensure the calling party is accurately identified.
