flowage easements shall be paid for by the United States over properties subject to frequent overflow in the Atchafalaya Basin below the approximate latitude of Krotz Springs: Provided further, That payment for rights-of-way, easements, and flowage rights acquired under this section, or reimbursement to the States or local interests furnishing them, shall be made as soon as the Chief of Engineers is satisfied that such rights-of-way, easements, or flowage rights have been acquired in conformity with local custom or legal procedure in such matters; and, thereafter, no liability of any kind shall attach to or rest upon the United States for any further damage by reason of diversions or flood waters: And provided further, That if the Secretary of Agriculture shall determine to acquire any of the properties within the floodways herein referred to, for national forests, wildlife refuges, or other purposes of his Department, the Secretary of the Army may, upon recommendation by the Chief

<br>(c) Tensas-Cocodrie backwater area
<br>
<br>In the development of the authorized project, the construction of a levee and improvements contemplated in the report of March 7, 1941, of the Mississippi River Commission from the main-line levee on the west bank of the Mississippi River in the vicinity of Shaw, Louisiana, westward and northward to the vicinity of Newlight, Louisiana, for the protection of that part of the Red River backwater known as the Tensas-Cocodrie area at an estimated cost of $6,976,000 is authorized: Provided, That the Chief of Engineers shall fix the grade of said levee, with a higher levee in his discretion, so that its construction will give the maximum practical protection without jeopardizing the safety and integrity of the main Mississippi River levees: And provided further, That prior to the beginning of construction local authorities shall furnish satisfactory assurances that they will (1) maintain the levee in accordance with the provisions of section 702c of this title, and will (2) not raise the said levee above the limiting elevations established therefor by the Chief of Engineers: Provided further, That subject to the foregoing conditions of local cooperation the Chief of Engineers may in his discretion substitute other levees and appurtenant works for, or make such modifications of, the levees and improvements herein authorized for the protection of the Tensas-Cocodrie area as may be found after further investigation to afford protection to a larger area in the Red River Backwater at a total cost not to exceed $29,000,000 and without jeopardizing the safety and integrity of the main Mississippi River levees and without preventing or jeopardizing the diversions contemplated in the adopted project through the Atchafalaya River and Atchafalaya Basin.
<br>(d) Reimbursement of local authorities for certain expenses
<br>
<br>The Chief of Engineers, with approval of the Secretary of the Army, shall reimburse local authorities for actual expenditures found by the Chief of Engineers to be reasonable, for providing at the request of the United States, in accordance with local legal procedure or custom, rights-of-way and flowage easements required for future setbacks of main-line Mississippi River levees.
<br>(e) Saint Francis River
<br>
<br>The existing engineering plan for flood control of the Saint Francis River is modified so as to permit the substitution for the suspended portions of the original project below Oak Donnick, Arkansas, of the construction of a ditch in Cross County, Arkansas, beginning in the vicinity of the outlet end of the existing Oak Donnick to Saint Francis Bay floodway and terminating in Saint Francis Bay about two miles north of Riverfront, including the construction of a highway bridge at State Highway Numbered 42 made necessary by the ditch construction: Provided, That local interests give assurances satisfactory to the Secretary of the Army that they will (1) provide without cost to the United States all lands, easements, and rights-of-way necessary for the construction; (2) hold and save the United States free from damages due to the construction works; and (3) maintain the works after completion in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Army.

<br>(g) Increased authorizations for alluvial valley, Mississippi River
<br>
<br>The total authorizations heretofore made for the flood control project of the alluvial valley of the Mississippi River shall not be increased by reason of any provision in this Act, except for the additional amounts necessary for the Yazoo and Red River backwater improvements, and any appropriations heretofore or hereafter made or authorized for said project as herein or heretofore modified may be expended upon any feature of the said project, notwithstanding any restrictions, limitations, or requirements of existing law: Provided, That funds hereafter expended for maintenance shall not be considered as reducing present remaining balances of authorizations.

(c) of this section (see 1950 Amendment note above), should be applied to such project.
<br>§702b. Local contribution toward cost of flood control work
<br>
<br>It is declared to be the sense of Congress that the principle of local contribution toward the cost of flood control work, which has been incorporated in all previous national legislation on the subject, is sound, as recognizing the special interest of the local population in its own protection, and as a means of preventing inordinate requests for unjustified items of work having no material national interest. As a full compliance with this principle in view of the great expenditure estimated at approximately $292,000,000, prior to May 15, 1928, made by the local interests in the alluvial valley of the Mississippi River for protection against the floods of that river; in view of the extent of national concern in the control of these floods in the interests of national prosperity, the flow of interstate commerce, and the movement of the United States mails; and, in view of the gigantic scale of the project, involving flood waters of a volume and flowing from a drainage area largely outside the States most affected, and far exceeding those of any other river in the United States, no local contribution to the project herein adopted is required.
