<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13621. White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for African Americans
<br>
<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13621, July 26, 2012, 77 F.R. 45471, provided:
<br>
<br>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, to restore the country to its role as the global leader in education, to strengthen the Nation by improving educational outcomes for African Americans of all ages, and to help ensure that all African Americans receive an education that properly prepares them for college, productive careers, and satisfying lives, it is hereby ordered as follows:
<br>
<br>Section 1. Policy. Over the course of America's history, African American men and women have strengthened our Nation, including by leading reforms, overcoming obstacles, and breaking down barriers. In the less than 60 years since the Brown v. Board of Education decision put America on a path toward equal educational opportunity, America's educational system has undergone a remarkable transformation, and many African American children who attended the substandard segregated schools of the 1950s have grown up to see their children attend integrated elementary and secondary schools, colleges, and universities.
<br>
<br>However, substantial obstacles to equal educational opportunity still remain in America's educational system. African Americans lack equal access to highly effective teachers and principals, safe schools, and challenging college-preparatory classes, and they disproportionately experience school discipline and referrals to special education. African American student achievement not only lags behind that of their domestic peers by an average of two grade levels, but also behind students in almost every other developed nation. Over a third of African American students do not graduate from high school on time with a regular high school diploma, and only four percent of African American high school graduates interested in college are college-ready across a range of subjects. An even greater number of African American males do not graduate with a regular high school diploma, and African American males also experience disparate rates of incarceration.
<br>
<br>Significantly improving the educational outcomes of African Americans will provide substantial benefits for our country by, among other things, increasing college completion rates, productivity, employment rates, and the number of African American teachers. Enhanced educational outcomes lead to more productive careers, improved economic opportunity, and greater social well-being for all Americans. Complementing the role of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in preparing generations of African American students for successful careers, and the work of my Administration's separate White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities, this new Initiative's focus on improving all the sequential levels of education will produce a more effective educational continuum for all African American students.
<br>
<br>To reach the ambitious education goals we have set for our Nation, as well as to ensure equality of access and opportunity for all, we must provide the support that will enable African American students to improve their level of educational achievement through rigorous and well-rounded academic and support services that will prepare them for college, a career, and a lifetime of learning.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for African Americans. (a) Establishment. There is hereby established the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for African Americans (Initiative), to be housed in the Department of Education (Department). There shall be an Executive Director of the Initiative, to be appointed by the Secretary of Education (Secretary). The Initiative shall be supported by the Interagency Working Group established under subsection (c) of this section and advised by the Commission established under section 3 of this order.
<br>
<br>(b) Mission and Functions.
<br>
<br>(1) The Initiative will help to restore the United States to its role as the global leader in education; strengthen the Nation by improving educational outcomes for African Americans of all ages; and help ensure that African Americans receive a complete and competitive education that prepares them for college, a satisfying career, and productive citizenship.
<br>
<br>(2) The Initiative will complement and reinforce the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Initiative established by Executive Order 13532 of February 26, 2010, and together, they both will support enhanced educational outcomes for African Americans at every level of the American education system, including early childhood education; elementary, secondary, and postsecondary education; career and technical education; and adult education.
<br>
<br>(3) To help expand educational opportunities, improve educational outcomes, and deliver a complete and competitive education for all African Americans, the Initiative shall, consistent with applicable law, promote, encourage, and undertake efforts designed to meet the following objectives:
<br>
<br>(i) increasing general understanding of the causes of the educational challenges faced by African American students, whether they are in urban, suburban, or rural learning environments;
<br>
<br>(ii) increasing the percentage of African American children who enter kindergarten ready for success by improving their access to high-quality programs and services that enable early learning and development of children from birth through age 5;
<br>
<br>(iii) decreasing the disproportionate number of referrals of African American children from general education to special education by addressing the root causes of the referrals and eradicating discriminatory referrals;
<br>
<br>(iv) implementing successful and innovative education reform strategies and practices in America's public schools to ensure that African American students receive a rigorous and well-rounded education in safe and healthy environments, and have access to high-level, rigorous course work and support services that will prepare them for college, a career, and civic participation;
<br>
<br>(v) ensuring that all African American students have comparable access to the resources necessary to obtain a high-quality education, including effective teachers and school leaders, in part by supporting efforts to improve the recruitment, preparation, development, and retention of successful African American teachers and school leaders and other effective teachers and school leaders responsible for the education of African American students;
<br>
<br>(vi) reducing the dropout rate of African American students and helping African American students graduate from high school prepared for college and a career, in part by promoting a positive school climate that does not rely on methods that result in disparate use of disciplinary tools, and by supporting successful and innovative dropout prevention and recovery strategies that better engage African American youths in their learning, help them catch up academically, and provide those who have left the educational system with pathways to reentry;
<br>
<br>(vii) increasing college access and success for African American students and providing support to help ensure that a greater percentage of African Americans complete college and contribute to the goal of having America again lead the world in the proportion of adults who are college graduates by 2020, in part through strategies to strengthen the capacity of institutions of higher education that serve large numbers of African American students, including community colleges, HBCUs, Predominantly Black Institutions (PBIs), and other institutions; and
<br>
<br>(viii) enhancing the educational and life opportunities of African Americans by fostering positive family and community engagement in education; reducing racial isolation and resegregation of elementary and secondary schools to promote understanding and tolerance among all Americans; improving the quality of, and expanding access to, adult education, literacy, and career and technical education; and increasing opportunities for education and career advancement in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.
<br>
<br>(4) In working to fulfill its mission and objectives, the Initiative shall, consistent with applicable law:
<br>
<br>(i) identify evidence-based best practices that can provide African American students a rigorous and well-rounded education in safe and healthy environments, as well as access to support services, which will prepare them for college, a career, and civic participation;
<br>
<br>(ii) develop a national network of individuals, organizations, and communities to share and implement best practices related to the education of African Americans, including those identified as most at risk;
<br>
<br>(iii) help ensure that Federal programs and initiatives administered by the Department and other agencies are serving and meeting the educational needs of African Americans, including by encouraging agencies to incorporate best practices into appropriate discretionary programs where permitted by law;
<br>
<br>(iv) work closely with the Executive Office of the President on key Administration priorities related to the education of African Americans;
<br>
<br>(v) increase the participation of the African American community, including institutions that serve that community, in the Department's programs and in education-related programs at other agencies;
<br>
<br>(vi) advise the officials of the Department and other agencies on issues related to the educational attainment of African Americans;
<br>
<br>(vii) advise the Secretary on the development, implementation, and coordination of educational programs and initiatives at the Department and other agencies that are designed to improve educational opportunities and outcomes for African Americans of all ages; and
<br>
<br>(viii) encourage and develop partnerships with public, private, philanthropic, and nonprofit stakeholders to improve African Americans' readiness for school, college, and career, as well as their college persistence and completion.
<br>
<br>(5) The Initiative shall periodically publish reports on its activities. The Secretary and the Executive Director of the Initiative, in consultation with the Working Group and the Chair of the Commission established under subsection (c) of this section and section 3 of this order, respectively, may develop and submit to the President recommendations designed to advance and promote educational opportunities and attainment for African Americans.
<br>
<br>(c) Interagency Working Group.
<br>
<br>(1) There is established the Federal Interagency Working Group on Educational Excellence for African Americans (Working Group), which shall be convened and chaired by the Initiative's Executive Director and that shall support the efforts of the Initiative described in subsection (b) of this section.
<br>
<br>(2) The Working Group shall consist of senior officials from the Department, the White House Domestic Policy Council, the Department of Justice, the Department of Labor, the Department of Health and Human Services, the National Science Foundation, the Department of Defense, and such additional agencies and offices as the President may subsequently designate. Senior officials shall be designated by the heads of their respective agencies and offices.
<br>
<br>(3) The Initiative's Executive Director may establish subgroups of the Working Group to focus on different aspects of the educational system (such as early childhood education, K–12 education, higher education (including HBCUs and PBIs), career and technical education, adult education, or correctional education and reengagement) or educational challenges facing particular populations of African Americans (such as young men, disconnected or out-of-school youth, individuals with disabilities, children identified as gifted and talented, single-parent households, or adults already in the workforce).
<br>
<br>(d) Administration. The Department shall provide funding and administrative support for the Initiative and the Working Group, to the extent permitted by law and within existing appropriations. To the extent permitted by law, other agencies and offices represented on the Working Group may detail personnel to the Initiative, to assist the Department in meeting the objectives of this order.
<br>
<br>(e) Collaboration Among White House Initiatives. The Initiative may collaborate with the White House Initiatives on American Indian and Alaska Native Education, Educational Excellence for Hispanics, Asian-American and Pacific Islanders, and (consistent with section 3(c) of this order) Historically Black Colleges and Universities, whenever appropriate in light of their shared objectives.
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. President's Advisory Commission on Educational Excellence for African Americans. (a) Establishment. There is established in the Department the President's Advisory Commission on Educational Excellence for African Americans (Commission).
<br>

<br>
<br>(2) The Commission may include individuals with relevant experience or subject-matter expertise that the President deems appropriate, as well as individuals who may serve as representatives of a variety of sectors, including the education sector (early childhood education, elementary and secondary education, higher education (including HBCUs and PBIs), career and technical education, and adult education), labor organizations, research institutions, the military, corporate and financial institutions, public and private philanthropic organizations, and nonprofit and community-based organizations at the national, State, regional, or local levels.

<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13935. White House Hispanic Prosperity Initiative
<br>
<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13935, July 9, 2020, 85 F.R. 42683, provided:
<br>
<br>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to improve Hispanic Americans' access to educational and economic opportunities, it is hereby ordered as follows:
<br>
<br>Section 1. Purpose. The success of Hispanic Americans is integral to the economic future of our country. As more than 60 million Hispanics live in the United States today, Hispanics are the largest minority group in the country. Hispanics are also the Nation's youngest major racial or ethnic group. Generations of Hispanics constituting different backgrounds and cultures have contributed to building a strong and prosperous America. Their collective contributions continue a legacy of inspiration that is a cherished part of the American experience.
<br>
<br>While we celebrate the many ways Hispanic Americans have contributed to our Nation, we also recognize that they face challenges in accessing educational and economic opportunities. In the last 3 years, my Administration has supported school choice, Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), and new career pathways, including apprenticeships and work-based learning initiatives, because quality education options offering multiple pathways to economic success are critical to developing our Nation's potential for the jobs of tomorrow. My Administration has also supported investment in economically distressed communities, including through Opportunity Zones, and economic opportunities for small and minority-owned businesses. The initiative set forth in this order increases emphasis on the connection between educational and economic opportunities, and exploring and promoting opportunities for Hispanic Americans, both through and outside traditional education options, that lead to economic prosperity. Today, Americans have more paths to prosperity than any previous generation, and it is necessary to ensure that Hispanic Americans have every opportunity to access these pathways and to fulfill their educational and economic aspirations.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. White House Hispanic Prosperity Initiative. There is established the White House Hispanic Prosperity Initiative (Initiative), housed in the Department of Education (Department).
<br>
<br>(a) The mission of the Initiative shall be to improve access by Hispanic Americans to educational and economic opportunities. Consistent with its mission, the Initiative shall:
<br>
<br>(i) identify and promote educational and workforce development practices that have improved educational, professional, and economic outcomes for Hispanic Americans;
<br>
<br>(ii) encourage private-sector initiatives and foster public-private partnerships that improve access to educational and economic opportunities for Hispanic Americans;
<br>
<br>(iii) develop a national network of individuals, organizations, and communities, with which to consult and collaborate regarding practices and policies that improve access to educational and economic opportunities for Hispanic Americans;
<br>
<br>(iv) monitor the development, implementation, and coordination of Federal Government educational, workforce, and business development programs designed to improve outcomes for Hispanic Americans; and
<br>
<br>(v) advise the President, through the Secretary of Education (Secretary), on issues of importance to Hispanic Americans and policies relating to Hispanic Americans' prosperity.
<br>
<br>(b) The Initiative shall be led by an Executive Director, designated by the Secretary. The Executive Director shall also serve as Executive Director of the Commission created by section 3 of this order. In addition to leading the work of the Initiative, the Executive Director shall coordinate the work of, and provide administrative support for, the Commission. As appropriate, the Department shall provide the Initiative with staff, resources, and administrative support, to the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
<br>

<br>Creating and Expanding Ladders of Opportunity for Boys and Young Men of Color
<br>
<br>Memorandum of President of the United States, Feb. 27, 2014, 79 F.R. 12923, as amended by Memorandum of President of the United States, §1, Jan. 13, 2017, 82 F.R. 7623, provided:
<br>
<br>Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
<br>
<br>Over the course of my Administration, we have made consistent progress on important goals such as reducing high school dropout rates and lowering unemployment and crime. Yet as the Congress, State and local governments, research institutions, and leading private-sector organizations have all recognized, persistent gaps in employment, educational outcomes, and career skills remain for many boys and young men of color throughout their lives.
<br>
<br>Many boys and young men of color will arrive at kindergarten less prepared than their peers in early language and literacy skills, leaving them less likely to finish school. Labor-force participation rates for young men of color have dropped, and far too many lack the skills they need to succeed. The disproportionate number of African American and Hispanic young men who are unemployed or involved in the criminal justice system undermines family and community stability and is a drag on State and Federal budgets. And, young men of color are far more likely to be victims of murder than their white peers, accounting for almost half of the country's murder victims each year. These outcomes are troubling, and they represent only a portion of the social and economic cost to our Nation when the full potential of so many boys and young men is left unrealized.
<br>
<br>By focusing on the critical challenges, risk factors, and opportunities for boys and young men of color at key life stages, we can improve their long-term outcomes and ability to contribute to the Nation's competiveness, economic mobility and growth, and civil society. Unlocking their full potential will benefit not only them, but all Americans.
<br>
<br>Therefore, I am establishing the Task Force on Improving the Lives of Boys and Young Men of Color and Underserved Youth, an interagency effort to improve measurably the expected educational and life outcomes for and address the persistent opportunity gaps faced by boys and young men of color. The Task Force will help us determine the public and private efforts that are working and how to expand upon them, how the Federal Government's own policies and programs can better support these efforts, and how to better involve State and local officials, the private sector, and the philanthropic community.
<br>
<br>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct the following:
<br>
<br>Section 1. Task Force on Improving the Lives of Boys and Young Men of Color and Underserved Youth. (a) There is established a Task Force on Improving the Lives of Boys and Young Men of Color and Underserved Youth (Task Force) to develop a coordinated Federal effort to improve significantly the expected life outcomes for boys and young men of color (including African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Native Americans) and their contributions to U.S. prosperity. The Task Force shall be chaired by the Assistant to the President and Cabinet Secretary. In addition to the Chair, the Task Force shall consist of the following members:
<br>
<br>(i) the Attorney General;
<br>
<br>(ii) the Secretary of Agriculture;
<br>
<br>(iii) the Secretary of Commerce;
<br>
<br>(iv) the Secretary of Defense;
<br>
<br>(v) the Secretary of Education;
<br>
<br>(vi) the Secretary of Energy;
<br>
<br>(vii) the Secretary of Health and Human Services;
<br>
<br>(viii) the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development;
<br>
<br>(ix) the Secretary of the Interior;
<br>
<br>(x) the Secretary of Labor;
<br>
<br>(xi) the Secretary of Transportation;
<br>
<br>(xii) the Director of the Office of Management and Budget;
<br>
<br>(xiii) the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers;
<br>
<br>(xiv) the Director of the Office of Personnel Management;
<br>
<br>(xv) the Administrator of the Small Business Administration;
<br>
<br>(xvi) the Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission;
<br>
<br>(xvii) the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation for National and Community Service;
<br>
<br>(xviii) the Director of the National Science Foundation;
<br>
<br>(xix) the Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental Affairs and Public Engagement;
<br>
<br>(xx) the Director of the Domestic Policy Council;
<br>
<br>(xxi) the Director of the National Economic Council;
<br>
<br>(xxii) the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy; and
<br>
<br>(xxiii) the heads of such other executive departments, agencies, and offices as the Chair may, from time to time, designate.
<br>
<br>(b) A member of the Task Force may designate a senior-level official who is from the member's department, agency, or office, and is a full-time officer or employee of the Federal Government, to perform the day-to-day Task Force functions of the member. At the direction of the Chair, the Task Force may establish subgroups consisting exclusively of Task Force members or their designees under this subsection, as appropriate.
<br>
<br>(c) The Deputy Secretary of Education shall serve as Executive Director of the Task Force, determine its agenda, convene regular meetings of the Task Force, and supervise its work under the direction of the Chair. The Department of Education shall provide funding and administrative support for the Task Force to the extent permitted by law and within existing appropriations.

<br>
<br>Sec. 2. Mission and Function of the Task Force. (a) The Task Force shall, consistent with applicable law, work across executive departments and agencies to:

<br>
<br>(ii) assess the impact of Federal policies, regulations, and programs of general applicability on boys and young men of color, so as to develop proposals that will enhance positive outcomes and eliminate or reduce negative ones;
<br>
<br>(iii) create an Administration-wide, online public portal to identify and disseminate successful programs and practices that improve outcomes for boys and young men of color;
<br>
<br>(iv) recommend, where appropriate, incentives for the broad adoption by national, State, and local public and private decisionmakers of effective and innovative strategies and practices for providing opportunities to and improving outcomes for boys and young men of color;
<br>
<br>(v) consistent with applicable privacy laws and regulations, provide relevant Federal data assets and expertise to public and private efforts to increase opportunities and improve life outcomes for boys and young men of color and underserved youth, and explore ways to coordinate with State and local governments and non-governmental actors with useful data and expertise;
<br>
<br>(vi) ensure coordination with other Federal interagency groups and relevant public-private initiatives;
<br>
<br>(vii) work with external stakeholders to highlight the opportunities, challenges, and efforts affecting boys and young men of color and underserved youth; and
<br>
<br>(viii) recommend to the President means of ensuring sustained efforts within the Federal Government and continued partnership with the private sector and philanthropic community as set forth in this memorandum.
<br>
<br>(b) The Task Force shall focus on evidence-based intervention points and issues facing boys and young men of color up to the age of 25, with a particular focus on issues important to young men under the age of 15. Specifically, the Task Force shall focus on the following issues, among others: access to early childhood supports; grade school literacy; pathways to college and a career, including issues arising from school disciplinary action; access to mentoring services and support networks; and interactions with the criminal justice system and violent crime.
<br>
<br>(c) Within 30 days of the date of this memorandum, each member of the Task Force shall provide recommended indicators of life outcomes for the public Web site described in subsection (a)(i) of this section, and a plan for providing data on such indicators.
<br>
<br>(d) Within 45 days of the date of this memorandum, each member of the Task Force shall identify any relevant programs and data-driven assessments within the member's department or agency for consideration in the portal described in subsection (a)(iii) of this section.
<br>
<br>(e) Within 90 days of the date of this memorandum, the Task Force shall provide the President with a report on its progress and recommendations with respect to the functions set forth in subsection (a) of this section.
