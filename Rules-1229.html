<br>§6067. Settlement of outstanding United States claims to confiscated property in Cuba
<br>(a) Report to Congress
<br>
<br>Not later than 180 days after March 12, 1996, the Secretary of State shall provide a report to the appropriate congressional committees containing an assessment of the property dispute question in Cuba, including—
<br>
<br>(1) an estimate of the number and amount of claims to property confiscated by the Cuban Government that are held by United States nationals in addition to those claims certified under section 1643f of this title;

<br>SUBCHAPTER III—PROTECTION OF PROPERTY RIGHTS OF UNITED STATES NATIONALS
<br>§6081. Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>(1) Individuals enjoy a fundamental right to own and enjoy property which is enshrined in the United States Constitution.
<br>
<br>(2) The wrongful confiscation or taking of property belonging to United States nationals by the Cuban Government, and the subsequent exploitation of this property at the expense of the rightful owner, undermines the comity of nations, the free flow of commerce, and economic development.
<br>
<br>(3) Since Fidel Castro seized power in Cuba in 1959—
<br>
<br>(A) he has trampled on the fundamental rights of the Cuban people; and
<br>
<br>(B) through his personal despotism, he has confiscated the property of—
<br>
<br>(i) millions of his own citizens;
<br>
<br>(ii) thousands of United States nationals; and
<br>
<br>(iii) thousands more Cubans who claimed asylum in the United States as refugees because of persecution and later became naturalized citizens of the United States.
<br>
<br>(4) It is in the interest of the Cuban people that the Cuban Government respect equally the property rights of Cuban nationals and nationals of other countries.
<br>
<br>(5) The Cuban Government is offering foreign investors the opportunity to purchase an equity interest in, manage, or enter into joint ventures using property and assets some of which were confiscated from United States nationals.
<br>
<br>(6) This "trafficking" in confiscated property provides badly needed financial benefit, including hard currency, oil, and productive investment and expertise, to the current Cuban Government and thus undermines the foreign policy of the United States—
<br>
<br>(A) to bring democratic institutions to Cuba through the pressure of a general economic embargo at a time when the Castro regime has proven to be vulnerable to international economic pressure; and
<br>
<br>(B) to protect the claims of United States nationals who had property wrongfully confiscated by the Cuban Government.
<br>
<br>(7) The United States Department of State has notified other governments that the transfer to third parties of properties confiscated by the Cuban Government "would complicate any attempt to return them to their original owners".
<br>
<br>(8) The international judicial system, as currently structured, lacks fully effective remedies for the wrongful confiscation of property and for unjust enrichment from the use of wrongfully confiscated property by governments and private entities at the expense of the rightful owners of the property.
<br>
<br>(9) International law recognizes that a nation has the ability to provide for rules of law with respect to conduct outside its territory that has or is intended to have substantial effect within its territory.
<br>
<br>(10) The United States Government has an obligation to its citizens to provide protection against wrongful confiscations by foreign nations and their citizens, including the provision of private remedies.
<br>
<br>(11) To deter trafficking in wrongfully confiscated property, United States nationals who were the victims of these confiscations should be endowed with a judicial remedy in the courts of the United States that would deny traffickers any profits from economically exploiting Castro's wrongful seizures.

<br>§6082. Liability for trafficking in confiscated property claimed by United States nationals
<br>(a) Civil remedy
<br>(1) Liability for trafficking
<br>
<br>(A) Except as otherwise provided in this section, any person that, after the end of the 3-month period beginning on the effective date of this subchapter, traffics in property which was confiscated by the Cuban Government on or after January 1, 1959, shall be liable to any United States national who owns the claim to such property for money damages in an amount equal to the sum of—
<br>
<br>(i) the amount which is the greater of—
<br>
<br>(I) the amount, if any, certified to the claimant by the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission under the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949 [22 U.S.C. 1621 et seq.], plus interest;
<br>
<br>(II) the amount determined under section 6083(a)(2) of this title, plus interest; or
<br>
<br>(III) the fair market value of that property, calculated as being either the current value of the property, or the value of the property when confiscated plus interest, whichever is greater; and
<br>
<br>(ii) court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees.
<br>
<br>(B) Interest under subparagraph (A)(i) shall be at the rate set forth in section 1961 of title 28, computed by the court from the date of confiscation of the property involved to the date on which the action is brought under this subsection.
<br>(2) Presumption in favor of the certified claims
<br>
<br>There shall be a presumption that the amount for which a person is liable under clause (i) of paragraph (1)(A) is the amount that is certified as described in subclause (I) of that clause. The presumption shall be rebuttable by clear and convincing evidence that the amount described in subclause (II) or (III) of that clause is the appropriate amount of liability under that clause.
<br>(3) Increased liability
<br>
<br>(A) Any person that traffics in confiscated property for which liability is incurred under paragraph (1) shall, if a United States national owns a claim with respect to that property which was certified by the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission under title V of the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949 [22 U.S.C. 1643 et seq.], be liable for damages computed in accordance with subparagraph (C).
<br>
<br>(B) If the claimant in an action under this subsection (other than a United States national to whom subparagraph (A) applies) provides, after the end of the 3-month period described in paragraph (1) notice to—
<br>
<br>(i) a person against whom the action is to be initiated, or
<br>
<br>(ii) a person who is to be joined as a defendant in the action,
<br>
<br>at least 30 days before initiating the action or joining such person as a defendant, as the case may be, and that person, after the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date the notice is provided, traffics in the confiscated property that is the subject of the action, then that person shall be liable to that claimant for damages computed in accordance with subparagraph (C).
<br>
<br>(C) Damages for which a person is liable under subparagraph (A) or subparagraph (B) are money damages in an amount equal to the sum of—
<br>
<br>(i) the amount determined under paragraph (1)(A)(ii), and
<br>
<br>(ii) 3 times the amount determined applicable under paragraph (1)(A)(i).
<br>
<br>(D) Notice to a person under subparagraph (B)—
<br>
<br>(i) shall be in writing;
<br>
<br>(ii) shall be posted by certified mail or personally delivered to the person; and
<br>
<br>(iii) shall contain—
<br>
<br>(I) a statement of intention to commence the action under this section or to join the person as a defendant (as the case may be), together with the reasons therefor;
<br>
<br>(II) a demand that the unlawful trafficking in the claimant's property cease immediately; and
<br>
<br>(III) a copy of the summary statement published under paragraph (8).
<br>(4) Applicability
<br>
<br>(A) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, actions may be brought under paragraph (1) with respect to property confiscated before, on, or after March 12, 1996.
<br>
<br>(B) In the case of property confiscated before March 12, 1996, a United States national may not bring an action under this section on a claim to the confiscated property unless such national acquires ownership of the claim before March 12, 1996.
<br>
<br>(C) In the case of property confiscated on or after March 12, 1996, a United States national who, after the property is confiscated, acquires ownership of a claim to the property by assignment for value, may not bring an action on the claim under this section.
<br>(5) Treatment of certain actions
<br>
<br>(A) In the case of a United States national who was eligible to file a claim with the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission under title V of the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949 [22 U.S.C. 1643 et seq.] but did not so file the claim, that United States national may not bring an action on that claim under this section.
<br>
<br>(B) In the case of any action brought under this section by a United States national whose underlying claim in the action was timely filed with the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission under title V of the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949 but was denied by the Commission, the court shall accept the findings of the Commission on the claim as conclusive in the action under this section.
<br>
<br>(C) A United States national, other than a United States national bringing an action under this section on a claim certified under title V of the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949, may not bring an action on a claim under this section before the end of the 2-year period beginning on March 12, 1996.
<br>
<br>(D) An interest in property for which a United States national has a claim certified under title V of the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949 may not be the subject of a claim in an action under this section by any other person. Any person bringing an action under this section whose claim has not been so certified shall have the burden of establishing for the court that the interest in property that is the subject of the claim is not the subject of a claim so certified.
<br>(6) Inapplicability of act of state doctrine
<br>
<br>No court of the United States shall decline, based upon the act of state doctrine, to make a determination on the merits in an action brought under paragraph (1) .
<br>(7) Licenses not required
<br>
<br>(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an action under this section may be brought and may be settled, and a judgment rendered in such action may be enforced, without obtaining any license or other permission from any agency of the United States, except that this paragraph shall not apply to the execution of a judgment against, or the settlement of actions involving, property blocked under the authorities of section 4305(b) of title 50, that were being exercised on July 1, 1977, as a result of a national emergency declared by the President before such date, and are being exercised on March 12, 1996.
<br>
<br>(B) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, and for purposes of this subchapter only, any claim against the Cuban Government shall not be deemed to be an interest in property the transfer of which to a United States national required before March 12, 1996, or requires after March 12, 1996, a license issued by, or the permission of, any agency of the United States.
<br>(8) Publication by Attorney General
<br>
<br>Not later than 60 days after March 12, 1996, the Attorney General shall prepare and publish in the Federal Register a concise summary of the provisions of this subchapter, including a statement of the liability under this subchapter of a person trafficking in confiscated property, and the remedies available to United States nationals under this subchapter.
<br>(b) Amount in controversy
<br>
<br>An action may be brought under this section by a United States national only where the amount in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $50,000, exclusive of interest, costs, and attorneys' fees. In calculating $50,000 for purposes of the preceding sentence, the applicable amount under subclause (I), (II), or (III) of subsection (a)(1)(A)(i) may not be tripled as provided in subsection (a)(3).
<br>(c) Procedural requirements
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in this subchapter, the provisions of title 28 and the rules of the courts of the United States apply to actions under this section to the same extent as such provisions and rules apply to any other action brought under section 1331 of title 28.
<br>(2) Service of process
<br>
<br>In an action under this section, service of process on an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state in the conduct of a commercial activity, or against individuals acting under color of law, shall be made in accordance with section 1608 of title 28.
<br>(d) Enforceability of judgments against Cuban Government
<br>
<br>In an action brought under this section, any judgment against an agency or instrumentality of the Cuban Government shall not be enforceable against an agency or instrumentality of either a transition government in Cuba or a democratically elected government in Cuba.
<br>(e) Omitted
<br>(f) Election of remedies
<br>(1) Election
<br>
<br>Subject to paragraph (2)—
<br>
<br>(A) any United States national that brings an action under this section may not bring any other civil action or proceeding under the common law, Federal law, or the law of any of the several States, the District of Columbia, or any commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States, that seeks monetary or nonmonetary compensation by reason of the same subject matter; and
<br>
<br>(B) any person who brings, under the common law or any provision of law other than this section, a civil action or proceeding for monetary or nonmonetary compensation arising out of a claim for which an action would otherwise be cognizable under this section may not bring an action under this section on that claim.
<br>(2) Treatment of certified claimants
<br>
<br>(A) In the case of any United States national that brings an action under this section based on a claim certified under title V of the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949 [22 U.S.C. 1643 et seq.]—
<br>
<br>(i) if the recovery in the action is equal to or greater than the amount of the certified claim, the United States national may not receive payment on the claim under any agreement entered into between the United States and Cuba settling claims covered by such title, and such national shall be deemed to have discharged the United States from any further responsibility to represent the United States national with respect to that claim;
<br>
<br>(ii) if the recovery in the action is less than the amount of the certified claim, the United States national may receive payment under a claims agreement described in clause (i) but only to the extent of the difference between the amount of the recovery and the amount of the certified claim; and
<br>
<br>(iii) if there is no recovery in the action, the United States national may receive payment on the certified claim under a claims agreement described in clause (i) to the same extent as any certified claimant who does not bring an action under this section.
<br>
<br>(B) In the event some or all actions brought under this section are consolidated by judicial or other action in such manner as to create a pool of assets available to satisfy the claims in such actions, including a pool of assets in a proceeding in bankruptcy, every claimant whose claim in an action so consolidated was certified by the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission under title V of the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949 [22 U.S.C. 1643 et seq.] shall be entitled to payment in full of its claim from the assets in such pool before any payment is made from the assets in such pool with respect to any claim not so certified.
<br>(g) Deposit of excess payments by Cuba under claims agreement
<br>
<br>Any amounts paid by Cuba under any agreement entered into between the United States and Cuba settling certified claims under title V of the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949 [22 U.S.C. 1643 et seq.] that are in excess of the payments made on such certified claims after the application of subsection (f) shall be deposited into the United States Treasury.
<br>(h) Termination of rights
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>All rights created under this section to bring an action for money damages with respect to property confiscated by the Cuban Government—
<br>
<br>(A) may be suspended under section 6064(a) of this title; and
<br>
<br>(B) shall cease upon transmittal to the Congress of a determination of the President under section 6063(c)(3) of this title that a democratically elected government in Cuba is in power.
<br>(2) Pending suits
<br>
<br>The suspension or termination of rights under paragraph (1) shall not affect suits commenced before the date of such suspension or termination (as the case may be), and in all such suits, proceedings shall be had, appeals taken, and judgments rendered in the same manner and with the same effect as if the suspension or termination had not occurred.
<br>(i) Imposition of filing fees
<br>
<br>The Judicial Conference of the United States shall establish a uniform fee that shall be imposed upon the plaintiff or plaintiffs in each action brought under this section. The fee should be established at a level sufficient to recover the costs to the courts of actions brought under this section.

<br>§6101. Establishment of Fellowship Program
<br>(a) Establishment
<br>
<br>(1) There is hereby established the "Mike Mansfield Fellowship Program" pursuant to which the Director of the United States Information Agency will make grants, subject to the availability of appropriations, to the Mansfield Center for Pacific Affairs to award fellowships to eligible United States citizens for periods of 2 years each (or, pursuant to section 6102(5)(C) of this title, for such shorter period of time as the Center may determine based on a Fellow's level of proficiency in the Japanese language or knowledge of the political economy of Japan) as follows:
<br>
<br>(A) During the first year each fellowship recipient will study the Japanese language as well as Japan's political economy.
<br>
<br>(B) During the second year each fellowship recipient will serve as a fellow in a parliamentary office, ministry, or other agency of the Government of Japan or, subject to the approval of the Center, a nongovernmental Japanese institution associated with the interests of the fellowship recipient, and the agency of the United States Government from which the fellow originated, consistent with the purposes of this chapter.
<br>
<br>(2) Fellowships under this chapter may be known as "Mansfield Fellowships", and individuals awarded such fellowships may be known as "Mansfield Fellows".
<br>(b) Eligibility of Center for grants
<br>
<br>Grants may be made to the Center under this section only if the Center agrees to comply with the requirements of section 6102 of this title.
<br>(c) International agreement
<br>
<br>The Director of the United States Information Agency should enter into negotiations for an agreement with the Government of Japan for the purpose of placing fellows in the Government of Japan.
<br>(d) Private sources
<br>
<br>The Center is authorized to accept, use, and dispose of gifts or donations of services or property in carrying out the fellowship program, subject to the review and approval of the Director of the United States Information Agency.
<br>(e) Use of Federal facilities
<br>
<br>The George P. Shultz National Foreign Affairs Training Center is authorized and encouraged to assist, on a reimbursable basis, in carrying out Japanese language training by the Center through the provision of teachers, classroom space, teaching materials, and facilities, to the extent that such provision is not detrimental to the Institute's carrying out its other responsibilities under law.

<br>
<br>(4) During the period of the fellowship, the Center shall provide—
<br>
<br>(A) to each fellow who is not a detailee a stipend at a rate of pay equal to the rate of pay that individual was receiving when he or she entered the program, plus a cost-of-living adjustment calculated at the same rate of pay, and for the same period of time, for which such adjustments were made to the salaries of individuals occupying competitive positions in the civil service during the same period as the fellowship; and
<br>
<br>(B) to each fellow (including detailees) certain allowances and benefits as that individual would have been entitled to, but for his or her separation from Government service, as a United States Government civilian employee overseas under the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas) of the Department of State, as follows: a living quarters allowance to cover the higher cost of housing in Japan, a post allowance to cover the significantly higher costs of living in Japan, an education allowance to assist parents in providing their children with educational services ordinarily provided without charge by United States public schools, moving expenses of up to $1,000 for personal belongings of fellows and their families in their move to Japan and one-round-trip economy-class airline ticket to Japan for each fellow and the fellow's immediate family.

<br>
<br>(7) The Center shall select fellows based solely on merit. The Center shall make positive efforts to recruit candidates reflecting the cultural, racial, and ethnic diversity of the United States.

<br>
<br>(11) The Center shall provide a report of the audit to the Director of the United States Information Agency no later than six months following the close of the fiscal year for which the audit is made. The report shall set forth the scope of the audit and include such statements, together with the independent auditor's opinion of those statements, as are necessary to present fairly the Center's assets and liabilities, surplus or deficit, with reasonable detail, including a statement of the Center's income and expenses during the year, including a schedule of all contracts and grants requiring payments in excess of $5,000 and any payments of compensation, salaries, or fees at a rate in excess of $5,000 per year.

<br>(1) It is the policy of the United States to promote the right of freedom of opinion and expression, including the freedom "to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers," in accordance with Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
<br>
<br>(2) Open communication of information and ideas among the peoples of the world contributes to international peace and stability and the promotion of such communication is in the interests of the United States.
<br>
<br>(3) It is in the interest of the United States to support broadcasting to other nations consistent with the requirements of this chapter.
<br>
<br>(4) The continuation of existing United States international broadcasting, and the creation of a new broadcasting service to the people of the People's Republic of China and other countries of Asia which lack adequate sources of free information, would enhance the promotion of information and ideas, while advancing the goals of United States foreign policy.
<br>
<br>(5) The reorganization and consolidation of United States international broadcasting will achieve important economies and strengthen the capability of the United States to use broadcasting to support freedom and democracy in a rapidly changing international environment.

<br>§6202. Standards and principles
<br>(a) Broadcasting standards
<br>
<br>United States international broadcasting shall—
<br>
<br>(1) be consistent with the broad foreign policy objectives of the United States;
<br>
<br>(2) be consistent with the international telecommunications policies and treaty obligations of the United States;
<br>
<br>(3) not duplicate the activities of private United States broadcasters;
<br>
<br>(4) not duplicate the activities of government supported broadcasting entities of other democratic nations;
<br>
<br>(5) be conducted in accordance with the highest professional standards of broadcast journalism;
<br>
<br>(6) be based on reliable information about its potential audience;
<br>
<br>(7) be designed so as to effectively reach a significant audience; and
<br>
<br>(8) promote respect for human rights, including freedom of religion.
<br>(b) Broadcasting principles
<br>
<br>United States international broadcasting shall include—
<br>
<br>(1) news which is consistently reliable and authoritative, accurate, objective, and comprehensive;
<br>
<br>(2) a balanced and comprehensive projection of United States thought and institutions, reflecting the diversity of United States culture and society;
<br>
<br>(3) clear and effective presentation of the policies of the United States Government and responsible discussion and opinion on those policies, including editorials, broadcast by the Voice of America, which present the views of the United States Government;
<br>
<br>(4) the capability to provide a surge capacity to support United States foreign policy objectives during crises abroad;
<br>
<br>(5) programming to meet needs which remain unserved by the totality of media voices available to the people of certain nations;
<br>
<br>(6) information about developments in each significant region of the world;
<br>
<br>(7) a variety of opinions and voices from within particular nations and regions prevented by censorship or repression from speaking to their fellow countrymen;
<br>
<br>(8) reliable research capacity to meet the criteria under this section;
<br>
<br>(9) adequate transmitter and relay capacity to support the activities described in this section; and
<br>
<br>(10) training and technical support for independent indigenous media through government agencies or private United States entities.
<br>(c) Voice of America broadcasts
<br>
<br>The long-range interests of the United States are served by communicating directly with the peoples of the world by radio. To be effective, the Voice of America must win the attention and respect of listeners. These principles will therefore govern Voice of America (VOA) broadcasts:
<br>
<br>(1) VOA will serve as a consistently reliable and authoritative source of news. VOA news will be accurate, objective, and comprehensive.
<br>
<br>(2) VOA will represent America, not any single segment of American society, and will therefore present a balanced and comprehensive projection of significant American thought and institutions.
<br>
<br>(3) VOA will present the policies of the United States clearly and effectively, and will also present responsible discussions and opinion on these policies.

<br>Pub. L. 116–283, div. A, title XII, §1299Q(b), Jan. 1, 2021, 134 Stat. 4021, which directed amendment of this section and was not executed, was itself amended by Pub. L. 116–260, div. O, title XIII, §1301, Dec. 27, 2020, 134 Stat. 2158, to make it effective 90 days after Jan. 1, 2021. However, the amendment by Pub. L. 116–260 could not be executed because it was enacted before the provision from Pub. L. 116–283 that it amended.
<br>Amendments
<br>
<br>2021—Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 116–283, §1299Q(b)(1), which directed insertion of ", including editorial independence" in subsec. (a) "before the semicolon at the end", was not executed because subsec. (a) contains 6 pars. that have a semicolon at the end and the probable intent of Congress could not be determined.
<br>
<br>Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 116–283, §1299Q(b)(2), which directed amendment of subsec. (b) by inserting ", including editorial independence," after "programing", was not executed because the word "programing" did not appear and the word "programming" at the beginning of par. (5) could not be clearly identified as the intended target.
<br>
<br>1998—Subsec. (a)(8). Pub. L. 105–292 added par. (8).
