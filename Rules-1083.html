<br>(2) Applicability despite orphan designation of certain indications
<br>
<br>This section shall apply with respect to a drug or biological product for which an indication has been granted orphan designation under 360bb 1 of this title if the investigation described in subsection (a)(3) applies to the drug or biological product as described in subsection (a)(1)(B).
<br>(l) New active ingredient
<br>(1) Non-interchangeable biosimilar biological product
<br>
<br>A biological product that is biosimilar to a reference product under section 262 of title 42, and that the Secretary has not determined to meet the standards described in subsection (k)(4) of such section for interchangeability with the reference product, shall be considered to have a new active ingredient under this section.
<br>(2) Interchangeable biosimilar biological product
<br>
<br>A biological product that is interchangeable with a reference product under section 262 of title 42 shall not be considered to have a new active ingredient under this section.

<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Within one year of August 18, 2017, the Secretary shall establish and update regularly, and shall publish on the internet website of the Food and Drug Administration—
<br>
<br>(A) a list of molecular targets considered, on the basis of data the Secretary determines to be adequate, to be substantially relevant to the growth and progression of a pediatric cancer, and that may trigger the requirements under this section; and
<br>
<br>(B) a list of molecular targets of new cancer drugs and biological products in development for which pediatric cancer study requirements under this section will be automatically waived.
<br>(2) Consultation
<br>
<br>In establishing the lists described in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall consult the National Cancer Institute, members of the internal committee under section 355d of this title, and the Pediatric Oncology Subcommittee of the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee, and shall take into account comments from the meeting under subsection (c).
<br>(3) Rule of construction
<br>
<br>Nothing in paragraph (1) shall be construed—
<br>
<br>(A) to require the inclusion of a molecular target on the list published under such paragraph as a condition for triggering the requirements under subsection (a)(1)(B) with respect to a drug or biological product directed at such molecular target; or
<br>
<br>(B) to authorize the disclosure of confidential commercial information, as prohibited under section 331(j) of this title or section 1905 of title 18.

<br>
<br>"(C) the scientific or operational challenges for which the Secretary may issue deferrals or waivers for an investigation described in subsection (a)(3) of such section 505B, including adverse impacts on current pediatric studies underway in a pediatric patient population, studies involving drugs designated as orphan drugs, treatment of a pediatric patient population, or the ability to complete adult clinical trials;
<br>
<br>"(D) how the Secretary and sponsors will facilitate collaboration among pediatric networks, academic centers, and experts in pediatric cancer to conduct an investigation described in subsection (a)(3) of such section 505B;
<br>
<br>"(E) scientific and regulatory considerations for study designs, including the applicability of innovative clinical trial designs for pediatric cancer drug and biological product developments under sections 505A and 505B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355a, 355c);
<br>
<br>"(F) approaches to streamline and improve the amendment process, including when studies contained in a request under such section 505A are not feasible due to the ethical, practical, or other barriers to conducting clinical trials in pediatric cancer populations;
<br>
<br>"(G) the process for submission of an initial pediatric study plan for the investigation described in section 505B(a)(3) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355c(a)(3)), including the process for a sponsor to meet and reach agreement with the Secretary on the initial pediatric study plan; and
