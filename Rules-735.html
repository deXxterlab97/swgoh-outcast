<br>
<br>Each lessor shall give a lessee prior to the consummation of the lease a dated written statement on which the lessor and lessee are identified setting out accurately and in a clear and conspicuous manner the following information with respect to that lease, as applicable:
<br>
<br>(1) A brief description or identification of the leased property;

<br>(3) The amount paid or payable by the lessee for official fees, registration, certificate of title, or license fees or taxes;
<br>
<br>(4) The amount of other charges payable by the lessee not included in the periodic payments, a description of the charges and that the lessee shall be liable for the differential, if any, between the anticipated fair market value of the leased property and its appraised actual value at the termination of the lease, if the lessee has such liability;
<br>
<br>(5) A statement of the amount or method of determining the amount of any liabilities the lease imposes upon the lessee at the end of the term and whether or not the lessee has the option to purchase the leased property and at what price and time;
<br>
<br>(6) A statement identifying all express warranties and guarantees made by the manufacturer or lessor with respect to the leased property, and identifying the party responsible for maintaining or servicing the leased property together with a description of the responsibility;
<br>
<br>(7) A brief description of insurance provided or paid for by the lessor or required of the lessee, including the types and amounts of the coverages and costs;
<br>
<br>(8) A description of any security interest held or to be retained by the lessor in connection with the lease and a clear identification of the property to which the security interest relates;
<br>
<br>(9) The number, amount, and due dates or periods of payments under the lease and the total amount of such periodic payments;
<br>
<br>(10) Where the lease provides that the lessee shall be liable for the anticipated fair market value of the property on expiration of the lease, the fair market value of the property at the inception of the lease, the aggregate cost of the lease on expiration, and the differential between them; and
<br>
<br>(11) A statement of the conditions under which the lessee or lessor may terminate the lease prior to the end of the term and the amount or method of determining any penalty or other charge for delinquency, default, late payments, or early termination.

<br>§1667b. Lessee's liability on expiration or termination of lease
<br>(a) Estimated residual value of property as basis; presumptions; action by lessor for excess liability; mutually agreeable final adjustment
<br>
<br>Where the lessee's liability on expiration of a consumer lease is based on the estimated residual value of the property such estimated residual value shall be a reasonable approximation of the anticipated actual fair market value of the property on lease expiration. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the estimated residual value is unreasonable to the extent that the estimated residual value exceeds the actual residual value by more than three times the average payment allocable to a monthly period under the lease. In addition, where the lessee has such liability on expiration of a consumer lease there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the lessor's estimated residual value is not in good faith to the extent that the estimated residual value exceeds the actual residual value by more than three times the average payment allocable to a monthly period under the lease and such lessor shall not collect from the lessee the amount of such excess liability on expiration of a consumer lease unless the lessor brings a successful action with respect to such excess liability. In all actions, the lessor shall pay the lessee's reasonable attorney's fees. The presumptions stated in this section shall not apply to the extent the excess of estimated over actual residual value is due to physical damage to the property beyond reasonable wear and use, or to excessive use, and the lease may set standards for such wear and use if such standards are not unreasonable. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the right of a willing lessee to make any mutually agreeable final adjustment with respect to such excess residual liability, provided such an agreement is reached after termination of the lease.
<br>(b) Penalties and charges for delinquency, default, or early termination
<br>
<br>Penalties or other charges for delinquency, default, or early termination may be specified in the lease but only at an amount which is reasonable in the light of the anticipated or actual harm caused by the delinquency, default, or early termination, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience or nonfeasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy.
<br>(c) Independent professional appraisal of residual value of property at termination of lease; finality
<br>
<br>If a lease has a residual value provision at the termination of the lease, the lessee may obtain at his expense, a professional appraisal of the leased property by an independent third party agreed to by both parties. Such appraisal shall be final and binding on the parties.
<br>

<br>§1667c. Consumer lease advertising; liability of advertising media
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>If an advertisement for a consumer lease includes a statement of the amount of any payment or a statement that any or no initial payment is required, the advertisement shall clearly and conspicuously state, as applicable—
<br>
<br>(1) the transaction advertised is a lease;
<br>
<br>(2) the total amount of any initial payments required on or before consummation of the lease or delivery of the property, whichever is later;
<br>
<br>(3) that a security deposit is required;
<br>
<br>(4) the number, amount, and timing of scheduled payments; and
<br>
<br>(5) with respect to a lease in which the liability of the consumer at the end of the lease term is based on the anticipated residual value of the property, that an extra charge may be imposed at the end of the lease term.
<br>(b) Advertising medium not liable
<br>
<br>No owner or employee of any entity that serves as a medium in which an advertisement appears or through which an advertisement is disseminated, shall be liable under this section.
<br>(c) Radio advertisements
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>An advertisement by radio broadcast to aid, promote, or assist, directly or indirectly, any consumer lease shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of subsection (a) if such advertisement clearly and conspicuously—
<br>
<br>(A) states the information required by paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a);
<br>
<br>(B) states the number, amounts, due dates or periods of scheduled payments, and the total of such payments under the lease;
<br>
<br>(C) includes—
<br>
<br>(i) a referral to—
<br>
<br>(I) a toll-free telephone number established in accordance with paragraph (2) that may be used by consumers to obtain the information required under subsection (a); or
<br>
<br>(II) a written advertisement that—
<br>
<br>(aa) appears in a publication in general circulation in the community served by the radio station on which such advertisement is broadcast during the period beginning 3 days before any such broadcast and ending 10 days after such broadcast; and
<br>
<br>(bb) includes the information required to be disclosed under subsection (a); and
<br>
<br>(ii) the name and dates of any publication referred to in clause (i)(II); and
<br>
<br>(D) includes any other information which the Bureau determines necessary to carry out this part.
<br>(2) Establishment of toll-free number
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>In the case of a radio broadcast advertisement described in paragraph (1) that includes a referral to a toll-free telephone number, the lessor who offers the consumer lease shall—
<br>
<br>(i) establish such a toll-free telephone number not later than the date on which the advertisement including the referral is broadcast;
<br>
<br>(ii) maintain such telephone number for a period of not less than 10 days, beginning on the date of any such broadcast; and
<br>
<br>(iii) provide the information required under subsection (a) with respect to the lease to any person who calls such number.
<br>(B) Form of information
<br>
<br>The information required to be provided under subparagraph (A)(iii) shall be provided verbally or, if requested by the consumer, in written form.
<br>(3) No effect on other law
<br>
<br>Nothing in this subsection shall affect the requirements of Federal law as such requirements apply to advertisement by any medium other than radio broadcast.

<br>Effective Date
<br>
<br>Section 2605(b)(2) of div. A of Pub. L. 104–208 provided that:
<br>
<br>"(A) In general.—Any regulation of the Board, or any amendment or interpretation of any regulation of the Board issued pursuant to section 187 of the Truth in Lending Act [15 U.S.C. 1667f] (as added by paragraph (1) of this subsection), shall become effective on the first October 1 that follows the date of promulgation of that regulation, amendment, or interpretation by not less than 6 months.
<br>
<br>"(B) Longer period.—The Board may, at the discretion of the Board, extend the time period referred to in subparagraph (A) in accordance with subparagraph (C), to permit lessors to adjust their disclosure forms to accommodate the requirements of section 127 [187] of the Truth in Lending Act (as added by paragraph (1) of this subsection).
<br>

<br>Congressional Findings and Declaration of Purposes
<br>
<br>Section 2605(a) of div. A of Pub. L. 104–208 provided that:
<br>
<br>"(1) Findings.—The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>"(A) competition among the various financial institutions and other firms engaged in the business of consumer leasing is greatest when there is informed use of leasing;
<br>
<br>"(B) the informed use of leasing results from an awareness of the cost of leasing by consumers; and
<br>
<br>"(C) there has been a continued trend toward leasing automobiles and other durable goods for consumer use as an alternative to installment credit sales and that leasing product advances have occurred such that lessors have been unable to provide consistent industry-wide disclosures to fully account for the competitive progress that has occurred.
<br>
<br>"(2) Purposes.—The purposes of this section are—
<br>
<br>"(A) to assure a simple, meaningful disclosure of leasing terms so that the consumer will be able to compare more readily the various leasing terms available to the consumer and avoid the uninformed use of leasing, and to protect the consumer against inaccurate and unfair leasing practices;
<br>
<br>"(B) to provide for adequate cost disclosures that reflect the marketplace without impairing competition and the development of new leasing products; and
<br>
<br>"(C) to provide the Board with the regulatory authority to assure a simplified, meaningful definition and disclosure of the terms of certain leases of personal property for personal, family, or household purposes so as to—
<br>
<br>"(i) enable the lessee to compare more readily the various lease terms available to the lessee;
<br>
<br>"(ii) enable comparison of lease terms with credit terms, as appropriate; and
<br>
<br>"(iii) assure meaningful and accurate disclosures of lease terms in advertisements."
<br>
<br>1 So in original. Probably should be "this".
<br>SUBCHAPTER II—RESTRICTIONS ON GARNISHMENT
<br>§1671. Congressional findings and declaration of purpose
<br>(a) Disadvantages of garnishment
<br>
<br>The Congress finds:
<br>
<br>(1) The unrestricted garnishment of compensation due for personal services encourages the making of predatory extensions of credit. Such extensions of credit divert money into excessive credit payments and thereby hinder the production and flow of goods in interstate commerce.
<br>
<br>(2) The application of garnishment as a creditors' remedy frequently results in loss of employment by the debtor, and the resulting disruption of employment, production, and consumption constitutes a substantial burden on interstate commerce.
<br>
<br>(3) The great disparities among the laws of the several States relating to garnishment have, in effect, destroyed the uniformity of the bankruptcy laws and frustrated the purposes thereof in many areas of the country.
<br>(b) Necessity for regulation
<br>
<br>On the basis of the findings stated in subsection (a) of this section, the Congress determines that the provisions of this subchapter are necessary and proper for the purpose of carrying into execution the powers of the Congress to regulate commerce and to establish uniform bankruptcy laws.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 90–321, title III, §301, May 29, 1968, 82 Stat. 163.)
<br>Effective Date
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 90–321, title V, §504(c), May 29, 1968, 82 Stat. 167, provided that: "Title III [enacting this section and sections 1672 to 1677 of this title] takes effect on July 1, 1970."
<br>§1672. Definitions
<br>
<br>For the purposes of this subchapter:
<br>
<br>(a) The term "earnings" means compensation paid or payable for personal services, whether denominated as wages, salary, commission, bonus, or otherwise, and includes periodic payments pursuant to a pension or retirement program.
<br>
<br>(b) The term "disposable earnings" means that part of the earnings of any individual remaining after the deduction from those earnings of any amounts required by law to be withheld.
<br>
<br>(c) The term "garnishment" means any legal or equitable procedure through which the earnings of any individual are required to be withheld for payment of any debt.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 90–321, title III, §302, May 29, 1968, 82 Stat. 163.)
<br>§1673. Restriction on garnishment
<br>(a) Maximum allowable garnishment
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subsection (b) and in section 1675 of this title, the maximum part of the aggregate disposable earnings of an individual for any workweek which is subjected to garnishment may not exceed
<br>
<br>(1) 25 per centum of his disposable earnings for that week, or
<br>
<br>(2) the amount by which his disposable earnings for that week exceed thirty times the Federal minimum hourly wage prescribed by section 206(a)(1) of title 29 in effect at the time the earnings are payable,
<br>
<br>whichever is less. In the case of earnings for any pay period other than a week, the Secretary of Labor shall by regulation prescribe a multiple of the Federal minimum hourly wage equivalent in effect to that set forth in paragraph (2).
<br>(b) Exceptions
<br>
<br>(1) The restrictions of subsection (a) do not apply in the case of
<br>
<br>(A) any order for the support of any person issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or in accordance with an administrative procedure, which is established by State law, which affords substantial due process, and which is subject to judicial review.
<br>
<br>(B) any order of any court of the United States having jurisdiction over cases under chapter 13 of title 11.
<br>
<br>(C) any debt due for any State or Federal tax.
<br>
<br>(2) The maximum part of the aggregate disposable earnings of an individual for any workweek which is subject to garnishment to enforce any order for the support of any person shall not exceed—
<br>
<br>(A) where such individual is supporting his spouse or dependent child (other than a spouse or child with respect to whose support such order is used), 50 per centum of such individual's disposable earnings for that week; and
<br>
<br>(B) where such individual is not supporting such a spouse or dependent child described in clause (A), 60 per centum of such individual's disposable earnings for that week;
<br>
<br>except that, with respect to the disposable earnings of any individual for any workweek, the 50 per centum specified in clause (A) shall be deemed to be 55 per centum and the 60 per centum specified in clause (B) shall be deemed to be 65 per centum, if and to the extent that such earnings are subject to garnishment to enforce a support order with respect to a period which is prior to the twelve-week period which ends with the beginning of such workweek.
<br>(c) Execution or enforcement of garnishment order or process prohibited
<br>

<br>SUBCHAPTER II–A—CREDIT REPAIR ORGANIZATIONS
<br>§1679. Findings and purposes
<br>(a) Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>(1) Consumers have a vital interest in establishing and maintaining their credit worthiness and credit standing in order to obtain and use credit. As a result, consumers who have experienced credit problems may seek assistance from credit repair organizations which offer to improve the credit standing of such consumers.
<br>
<br>(2) Certain advertising and business practices of some companies engaged in the business of credit repair services have worked a financial hardship upon consumers, particularly those of limited economic means and who are inexperienced in credit matters.
<br>(b) Purposes
<br>
<br>The purposes of this subchapter are—
<br>
<br>(1) to ensure that prospective buyers of the services of credit repair organizations are provided with the information necessary to make an informed decision regarding the purchase of such services; and
<br>
<br>(2) to protect the public from unfair or deceptive advertising and business practices by credit repair organizations.

<br>§1679c. Disclosures
<br>(a) Disclosure required
<br>
<br>Any credit repair organization shall provide any consumer with the following written statement before any contract or agreement between the consumer and the credit repair organization is executed:
<br>"Consumer Credit File Rights Under State and Federal Law
<br>
<br>"You have a right to dispute inaccurate information in your credit report by contacting the credit bureau directly. However, neither you nor any 'credit repair' company or credit repair organization has the right to have accurate, current, and verifiable information removed from your credit report. The credit bureau must remove accurate, negative information from your report only if it is over 7 years old. Bankruptcy information can be reported for 10 years.
<br>
<br>"You have a right to obtain a copy of your credit report from a credit bureau. You may be charged a reasonable fee. There is no fee, however, if you have been turned down for credit, employment, insurance, or a rental dwelling because of information in your credit report within the preceding 60 days. The credit bureau must provide someone to help you interpret the information in your credit file. You are entitled to receive a free copy of your credit report if you are unemployed and intend to apply for employment in the next 60 days, if you are a recipient of public welfare assistance, or if you have reason to believe that there is inaccurate information in your credit report due to fraud.
<br>
<br>"You have a right to sue a credit repair organization that violates the Credit Repair Organization Act. This law prohibits deceptive practices by credit repair organizations.
<br>
<br>"You have the right to cancel your contract with any credit repair organization for any reason within 3 business days from the date you signed it.
<br>
<br>"Credit bureaus are required to follow reasonable procedures to ensure that the information they report is accurate. However, mistakes may occur.
<br>
<br>"You may, on your own, notify a credit bureau in writing that you dispute the accuracy of information in your credit file. The credit bureau must then reinvestigate and modify or remove inaccurate or incomplete information. The credit bureau may not charge any fee for this service. Any pertinent information and copies of all documents you have concerning an error should be given to the credit bureau.
<br>
<br>"If the credit bureau's reinvestigation does not resolve the dispute to your satisfaction, you may send a brief statement to the credit bureau, to be kept in your file, explaining why you think the record is inaccurate. The credit bureau must include a summary of your statement about disputed information with any report it issues about you.
<br>

<br>"The Public Reference Branch
<br>"Federal Trade Commission
<br>"Washington, D.C. 20580".
<br>(b) Separate statement requirement
<br>
<br>The written statement required under this section shall be provided as a document which is separate from any written contract or other agreement between the credit repair organization and the consumer or any other written material provided to the consumer.
<br>(c) Retention of compliance records
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The credit repair organization shall maintain a copy of the statement signed by the consumer acknowledging receipt of the statement.
<br>(2) Maintenance for 2 years
<br>
<br>The copy of any consumer's statement shall be maintained in the organization's files for 2 years after the date on which the statement is signed by the consumer.

<br>SUBCHAPTER III—CREDIT REPORTING AGENCIES
<br>§1681. Congressional findings and statement of purpose
<br>(a) Accuracy and fairness of credit reporting
<br>
<br>The Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>(1) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.
<br>
<br>(2) An elaborate mechanism has been developed for investigating and evaluating the credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, and general reputation of consumers.
<br>
<br>(3) Consumer reporting agencies have assumed a vital role in assembling and evaluating consumer credit and other information on consumers.
<br>
<br>(4) There is a need to insure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and a respect for the consumer's right to privacy.
<br>(b) Reasonable procedures
<br>
<br>It is the purpose of this subchapter to require that consumer reporting agencies adopt reasonable procedures for meeting the needs of commerce for consumer credit, personnel, insurance, and other information in a manner which is fair and equitable to the consumer, with regard to the confidentiality, accuracy, relevancy, and proper utilization of such information in accordance with the requirements of this subchapter.

<br>"(a) Study Required.—The Commission and the Board, in consultation with the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, shall conduct a study of—

<br>"(1) the effects of the use of credit scores and credit-based insurance scores on the availability and affordability of financial products and services, including credit cards, mortgages, auto loans, and property and casualty insurance;
<br>
<br>"(2) the statistical relationship, utilizing a multivariate analysis that controls for prohibited factors under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act [15 U.S.C. 1691 et seq.] and other known risk factors, between credit scores and credit-based insurance scores and the quantifiable risks and actual losses experienced by businesses;
<br>
<br>"(3) the extent to which, if any, the use of credit scoring models, credit scores, and credit-based insurance scores impact on the availability and affordability of credit and insurance to the extent information is currently available or is available through proxies, by geography, income, ethnicity, race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex, marital status, and creed, including the extent to which the consideration or lack of consideration of certain factors by credit scoring systems could result in negative or differential treatment of protected classes under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and the extent to which, if any, the use of underwriting systems relying on these models could achieve comparable results through the use of factors with less negative impact; and
<br>
<br>"(4) the extent to which credit scoring systems are used by businesses, the factors considered by such systems, and the effects of variables which are not considered by such systems.
<br>
<br>"(b) Public Participation.—The Commission shall seek public input about the prescribed methodology and research design of the study described in subsection (a), including from relevant Federal regulators, State insurance regulators, community, civil rights, consumer, and housing groups.

<br>
<br>"(A) the efficacy of increasing the number of points of identifying information that a credit reporting agency is required to match to ensure that a consumer is the correct individual to whom a consumer report relates before releasing a consumer report to a user, including—
<br>
<br>"(i) the extent to which requiring additional points of such identifying information to match would—
<br>
<br>     "(I) enhance the accuracy of credit reports; and
<br>
<br>     "(II) combat the provision of incorrect consumer reports to users;
<br>
<br>"(ii) the extent to which requiring an exact match of the first and last name, social security number, and address and ZIP Code of the consumer would enhance the likelihood of increasing credit report accuracy; and
<br>
<br>"(iii) the effects of allowing consumer reporting agencies to use partial matches of social security numbers and name recognition software on the accuracy of credit reports;
<br>
<br>"(B) requiring notification to consumers when negative information has been added to their credit reports, including—
<br>
<br>"(i) the potential impact of such notification on the ability of consumers to identify errors on their credit reports; and
<br>
<br>"(ii) the potential impact of such notification on the ability of consumers to remove fraudulent information from their credit reports;
<br>
<br>"(C) the effects of requiring that a consumer who has experienced an adverse action based on a credit report receives a copy of the same credit report that the creditor relied on in taking the adverse action, including—
<br>
<br>"(i) the extent to which providing such reports to consumers would increase the ability of consumers to identify errors in their credit reports; and
<br>
<br>"(ii) the extent to which providing such reports to consumers would increase the ability of consumers to remove fraudulent information from their credit reports;
<br>
<br>"(D) any common financial transactions that are not generally reported to the consumer reporting agencies, but would provide useful information in determining the credit worthiness of consumers; and
<br>
<br>"(E) any actions that might be taken within a voluntary reporting system to encourage the reporting of the types of transactions described in subparagraph (D).
<br>
<br>"(3) Costs and benefits.—With respect to each area of study described in paragraph (2), the Commission shall consider the extent to which such requirements would benefit consumers, balanced against the cost of implementing such provisions.
<br>
<br>"(b) Report Required.—Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act [Dec. 4, 2003], the chairman of the Commission shall submit a report to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives containing a detailed summary of the findings and conclusions of the study under this section, together with such recommendations for legislative or administrative actions as may be appropriate."
