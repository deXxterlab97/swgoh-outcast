<br>(C) available information regarding the emission reduction effectiveness and cost effectiveness of technologies identified in this paragraph, taking into consideration air quality and health effects.
<br>
<br>(3) Priority consideration.—States and metropolitan planning organizations shall give priority in areas designated as nonattainment or maintenance for PM2.5 under the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) in distributing funds received for congestion mitigation and air quality projects and programs from apportionments under section 104(b)(4) to projects that are proven to reduce PM2.5, including diesel retrofits.
<br>
<br>(4) No effect on authority or restrictions.—Nothing in this subsection modifies or otherwise affects any authority or restriction established under the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) or any other law (other than provisions of this title relating to congestion mitigation and air quality).
<br>
<br>(h) Interagency Consultation.—The Secretary shall encourage States and metropolitan planning organizations to consult with State and local air quality agencies in nonattainment and maintenance areas on the estimated emission reductions from proposed congestion mitigation and air quality improvement programs and projects.
<br>
<br>(i) Evaluation and Assessment of Projects.—
<br>
<br>(1) Database.—
<br>
<br>(A) In general.—Using appropriate assessments of projects funded under the congestion mitigation and air quality program and results from other research, the Secretary shall maintain and disseminate a cumulative database describing the impacts of the projects, including specific information about each project, such as the project name, location, sponsor, cost, and, to the extent already measured by the project sponsor, cost-effectiveness, based on reductions in congestion and emissions.
<br>
<br>(B) Availability.—The database shall be published or otherwise made readily available by the Secretary in electronically accessible format and means, such as the Internet, for public review.
<br>
<br>(2) Cost effectiveness.—
<br>
<br>(A) In general.—The Secretary, in consultation with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, shall evaluate projects on a periodic basis and develop a table or other similar medium that illustrates the cost-effectiveness of a range of project types eligible for funding under this section as to how the projects mitigate congestion and improve air quality.
<br>
<br>(B) Contents.—The table described in subparagraph (A) shall show measures of cost-effectiveness, such as dollars per ton of emissions reduced, and assess those measures over a variety of timeframes to capture impacts on the planning timeframes outlined in section 134.
<br>
<br>(C) Use of table.—States and metropolitan planning organizations shall consider the information in the table when selecting projects or developing performance plans under subsection (l).
<br>
<br>(j) Optional Programmatic Eligibility.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—At the discretion of a metropolitan planning organization, a technical assessment of a selected program of projects may be conducted through modeling or other means to demonstrate the emissions reduction projection required under this section.
<br>
<br>(2) Applicability.—If an assessment described in paragraph (1) successfully demonstrates an emissions reduction, all projects included in such assessment shall be eligible for obligation under this section without further demonstration of emissions reduction of individual projects included in such assessment.
<br>
<br>(k) Priority for Use of Funds in PM2.5 Areas.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—For any State that has a nonattainment or maintenance area for fine particulate matter, an amount equal to 25 percent of the funds apportioned to each State under section 104(b)(4) for a nonattainment or maintenance area that are based all or in part on the weighted population of such area in fine particulate matter nonattainment shall be obligated to projects that reduce such fine particulate matter emissions in such area, including diesel retrofits.
<br>
<br>(2) Construction equipment and vehicles.—In order to meet the requirements of paragraph (1), a State or metropolitan planning organization may elect to obligate funds to install diesel emission control technology on nonroad diesel equipment or on-road diesel equipment that is operated on a highway construction project within a PM2.5 nonattainment or maintenance area.
<br>
<br>(3) PM2.5 nonattainment and maintenance in low population density states.—
<br>
<br>(A) Exception.—In any State with a population density of 80 or fewer persons per square mile of land area, based on the most recent decennial census, the requirements under subsection (g)(3) and paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection shall not apply to a nonattainment or maintenance area in the State if—
<br>
<br>(i) the nonattainment or maintenance area does not have projects that are part of the emissions analysis of a metropolitan transportation plan or transportation improvement program; and
<br>
<br>(ii) regional motor vehicle emissions are an insignificant contributor to the air quality problem for PM2.5 in the nonattainment or maintenance area.
<br>
<br>(B) Calculation.—If subparagraph (A) applies to a nonattainment or maintenance area in a State, the percentage of the PM2.5 set-aside under paragraph (1) shall be reduced for that State proportionately based on the weighted population of the area in fine particulate matter nonattainment.
<br>
<br>(4) Port-related equipment and vehicles.—To meet the requirements under paragraph (1), a State or metropolitan planning organization may elect to obligate funds to the most cost-effective projects to reduce emissions from port-related landside nonroad or on-road equipment that is operated within the boundaries of a PM2.5 nonattainment or maintenance area.
<br>
<br>(l) Performance Plan.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—Each metropolitan planning organization serving a transportation management area (as defined in section 134) with a population over 1,000,000 people representing a nonattainment or maintenance area shall develop a performance plan that—
<br>
<br>(A) includes an area baseline level for traffic congestion and on-road mobile source emissions for which the area is in nonattainment or maintenance;
<br>
<br>(B) describes progress made in achieving the air quality and traffic congestion performance targets described in section 150(d); and
<br>
<br>(C) includes a description of projects identified for funding under this section and how such projects will contribute to achieving emission and traffic congestion reduction targets.
<br>
<br>(2) Updated plans.—Performance plans shall be updated biennially and include a separate report that assesses the progress of the program of projects under the previous plan in achieving the air quality and traffic congestion targets of the previous plan.
<br>
<br>(m) Operating Assistance.—A State may obligate funds apportioned under section 104(b)(4) in an area of such State that is otherwise eligible for obligations of such funds for operating costs under chapter 53 of title 49 or on a system for which CMAQ funding was made available, obligated or expended in fiscal year 2012, or on a State-Supported 1 Amtrak route with a valid cost-sharing agreement under section 209 of the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 and no current nonattainment areas under subsection (d), and shall have no imposed time limitation.
