<br>§3722. Protections against transshipment
<br>(a) Preferential treatment conditioned on enforcement measures
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The preferential treatment under section 3721(a) of this title shall not be provided to textile and apparel articles that are imported from a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country unless that country—
<br>
<br>(A) has adopted an effective visa system, domestic laws, and enforcement procedures applicable to covered articles to prevent unlawful transshipment of the articles and the use of counterfeit documents relating to the importation of the articles into the United States;
<br>
<br>(B) has enacted legislation or promulgated regulations that would permit United States Customs Service verification teams to have the access necessary to investigate thoroughly allegations of transshipment through such country;
<br>
<br>(C) agrees to report, on a timely basis, at the request of the United States Customs Service, on the total exports from and imports into that country of covered articles, consistent with the manner in which the records are kept by that country;
<br>
<br>(D) will cooperate fully with the United States to address and take action necessary to prevent circumvention as provided in Article 5 of the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing;
<br>
<br>(E) agrees to require all producers and exporters of covered articles in that country to maintain complete records of the production and the export of covered articles, including materials used in the production, for at least 2 years after the production or export (as the case may be); and
<br>
<br>(F) agrees to report, on a timely basis, at the request of the United States Customs Service, documentation establishing the country of origin of covered articles as used by that country in implementing an effective visa system.
<br>(2) Country of origin documentation
<br>
<br>For purposes of paragraph (1)(F), documentation regarding the country of origin of the covered articles includes documentation such as production records, information relating to the place of production, the number and identification of the types of machinery used in production, the number of workers employed in production, and certification from both the manufacturer and the exporter.
<br>(b) Customs procedures and enforcement
<br>(1) In general
<br>(A) Regulations
<br>
<br>Any importer that claims preferential treatment under section 3721 of this title shall comply with customs procedures similar in all material respects to the requirements of article 5.4.1 of the USMCA as implemented pursuant to United States law, in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury.
<br>(B) Determination
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>In order to qualify for the preferential treatment under section 3721 of this title and for a Certificate of Origin to be valid with respect to any article for which such treatment is claimed, there shall be in effect a determination by the President that each country described in clause (ii)—
<br>
<br>(I) has implemented and follows; or
<br>
<br>(II) is making substantial progress toward implementing and following,
<br>
<br> procedures and requirements similar in all material respects to the relevant procedures and requirements under chapter 5 of the USMCA.
<br>(ii) Country described
<br>
<br>A country is described in this clause if it is a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country—
<br>
<br>(I) from which the article is exported; or
<br>
<br>(II) in which materials used in the production of the article originate or in which the article or such materials, undergo production that contributes to a claim that the article is eligible for preferential treatment.
<br>(2) Certificate of Origin
<br>
<br>The Certificate of Origin that otherwise would be required pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (1) shall not be required in the case of an article imported under section 3721 of this title if such Certificate of Origin would not be required under article 5.5 of the USMCA (as implemented pursuant to United States law), if the article were imported from Mexico.
<br>(3) Penalties for exporters
<br>
<br>If the President determines, based on sufficient evidence, that an exporter has engaged in transshipment as defined in paragraph (4), then the President shall deny for a period of 5 years all benefits under section 3721 of this title to such exporter, any successor of such exporter, and any other entity owned or operated by the principal of the exporter.
<br>(4) Transshipment described
<br>
<br>Transshipment within the meaning of this subsection has occurred when preferential treatment for a textile or apparel article under this chapter 1 has been claimed on the basis of material false information concerning the country of origin, manufacture, processing, or assembly of the article or any of its components. For purposes of this paragraph, false information is material if disclosure of the true information would mean or would have meant that the article is or was ineligible for preferential treatment under section 3721 of this title.
<br>(5) Monitoring and reports to Congress
<br>
<br>The Customs Service shall monitor and the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection shall submit to Congress, not later than March 31 of each year, a report on the effectiveness of the visa systems and the implementation of legislation and regulations described in subsection (a) and on measures taken by countries in sub-Saharan Africa which export textiles or apparel to the United States to prevent circumvention as described in Article 5 of the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing.
<br>(c) Customs Service enforcement
<br>
<br>The Customs Service shall—
<br>
<br>(1) make available technical assistance to the beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries—
<br>
<br>(A) in the development and implementation of visa systems, legislation, and regulations described in subsection (a)(1)(A); and
<br>
<br>(B) to train their officials in anti-transshipment enforcement;
<br>
<br>(2) send production verification teams to at least four beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries each year; and
<br>
<br>(3) to the extent feasible, place beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries on the Electronic Visa (ELVIS) program.
<br>(d) Authorization of appropriations
<br>
<br>There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out subsection (c) the sum of $5,894,913.

<br>SUBCHAPTER III—ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT RELATED ISSUES
<br>§3731. Sense of the Congress regarding comprehensive debt relief for the world's poorest countries
<br>(a) Findings
<br>
<br>Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>(1) The burden of external debt has become a major impediment to economic growth and poverty reduction in many of the world's poorest countries.
<br>
<br>(2) Until recently, the United States Government and other official creditors sought to address this problem by rescheduling loans and in some cases providing limited debt reduction.
<br>
<br>(3) Despite such efforts, the cumulative debt of many of the world's poorest countries continued to grow beyond their capacity to repay.
<br>
<br>(4) In 1997, the Group of Seven, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund adopted the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC), a commitment by the international community that all multilateral and bilateral creditors, acting in a coordinated and concerted fashion, would reduce poor country debt to a sustainable level.
<br>
<br>(5) The HIPC Initiative is currently undergoing reforms to address concerns raised about country conditionality, the amount of debt forgiven, and the allocation of savings realized through the debt forgiveness program to ensure that the Initiative accomplishes the goals of economic growth and poverty alleviation in the world's poorest countries.
<br>(b) Sense of the Congress
<br>
<br>It is the sense of the Congress that—
<br>
<br>(1) Congress and the President should work together, without undue delay and in concert with the international community, to make comprehensive debt relief available to the world's poorest countries in a manner that promotes economic growth and poverty alleviation;
<br>
<br>(2) this program of bilateral and multilateral debt relief should be designed to strengthen and expand the private sector, encourage increased trade and investment, support the development of free markets, and promote broad-scale economic growth in beneficiary countries;
<br>
<br>(3) this program of debt relief should also support the adoption of policies to alleviate poverty and to ensure that benefits are shared widely among the population, such as through initiatives to advance education, improve health, combat AIDS, and promote clean water and environmental protection;
<br>
<br>(4) these debt relief agreements should be designed and implemented in a transparent manner and with the broad participation of the citizenry of the debtor country and should ensure that country circumstances are adequately taken into account;
<br>
<br>(5) no country should receive the benefits of debt relief if that country does not cooperate with the United States on terrorism or narcotics enforcement, is a gross violator of the human rights of its citizens, or is engaged in conflict or spends excessively on its military; and
<br>
<br>(6) in order to prevent adverse impact on a key industry in many developing countries, the International Monetary Fund must mobilize its own resources for providing debt relief to eligible countries without allowing gold to reach the open market, or otherwise adversely affecting the market price of gold.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 106–200, title I, §121, May 18, 2000, 114 Stat. 267.)
<br>§3732. Executive branch initiatives
<br>(a) Statement of the Congress
<br>
<br>The Congress recognizes that the stated policy of the executive branch in 1997, the "Partnership for Growth and Opportunity in Africa" initiative, is a step toward the establishment of a comprehensive trade and development policy for sub-Saharan Africa. It is the sense of the Congress that this Partnership is a companion to the policy goals set forth in this chapter.
<br>(b) Technical assistance to promote economic reforms and development
<br>
<br>In addition to continuing bilateral and multilateral economic and development assistance, the President shall target technical assistance toward—
<br>
<br>(1) developing relationships between United States firms and firms in sub-Saharan Africa through a variety of business associations and networks;
<br>
<br>(2) providing assistance to the governments of sub-Saharan African countries to—
<br>
<br>(A) liberalize trade and promote exports;
<br>
<br>(B) bring their legal regimes into compliance with the standards of the World Trade Organization in conjunction with membership in that Organization;
<br>
<br>(C) make financial and fiscal reforms; and
<br>
<br>(D) promote greater agribusiness linkages;
<br>
<br>(3) addressing such critical agricultural policy issues as market liberalization, agricultural export development, and agribusiness investment in processing and transporting agricultural commodities;
<br>
<br>(4) increasing the number of reverse trade missions to growth-oriented countries in sub-Saharan Africa;
<br>
<br>(5) increasing trade in services; and
<br>
<br>(6) encouraging greater sub-Saharan African participation in future negotiations in the World Trade Organization on services and making further commitments in their schedules to the General Agreement on Trade in Services in order to encourage the removal of tariff and nontariff barriers.

<br>§3733. Overseas Private Investment Corporation initiatives
<br>(a) Initiation of funds
<br>
<br>It is the sense of the Congress that the Overseas Private Investment Corporation 1 should exercise the authorities it has to initiate an equity fund or equity funds in support of projects in the countries in sub-Saharan Africa, in addition to the existing equity fund for sub-Saharan Africa created by the Corporation.
<br>(b) Structure and types of funds

<br>(2) Capitalization
<br>
<br>Each fund should be capitalized with a combination of private equity capital, which is not guaranteed by the Corporation, and debt for which the Corporation provides guaranties.
<br>(3) Infrastructure fund
<br>
<br>One or more of the funds, with combined assets of up to $500,000,000, should be used in support of infrastructure projects in countries of sub-Saharan Africa.

<br>The Corporation shall ensure that the funds are used to provide support in particular to women entrepreneurs and to innovative investments that expand opportunities for women and maximize employment opportunities for poor individuals.

<br>

<br>
<br>It is the sense of the Congress that the Board of Directors of the Bank shall continue to take comprehensive measures, consistent with the credit standards otherwise required by law, to promote the expansion of the Bank's financial commitments in sub-Saharan Africa under the loan, guarantee and insurance programs of the Bank.
<br>(b) Sub-Saharan Africa Advisory Committee
<br>
<br>The sub-Saharan Africa Advisory Committee (SAAC) is to be commended for aiding the Bank in advancing the economic partnership between the United States and the nations of sub-Saharan Africa by doubling the number of sub-Saharan African countries in which the Bank is open for traditional financing and by increasing by tenfold the Bank's support for sales to sub-Saharan Africa from fiscal year 1998 to fiscal year 1999. The Board of Directors of the Bank and its staff shall continue to review carefully the sub-Saharan Africa Advisory Committee recommendations on the development and implementation of new and innovative policies and programs designed to promote the Bank's expansion in sub-Saharan Africa.

<br>§3735. Expansion of the United States and Foreign Commercial Service in sub-Saharan Africa
<br>(a) Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>(1) The United States and Foreign Commercial Service (hereafter in this section referred to as the "Commercial Service") plays an important role in helping United States businesses identify export opportunities and develop reliable sources of information on commercial prospects in foreign countries.
<br>
<br>(2) During the 1980s, the presence of the Commercial Service in sub-Saharan Africa consisted of 14 professionals providing services in eight countries. By early 1997, that presence had been reduced by half to seven professionals in only four countries.
<br>
<br>(3) Since 1997, the Department of Commerce has slowly begun to increase the presence of the Commercial Service in sub-Saharan Africa, adding five full-time officers to established posts.
<br>
<br>(4) Although the Commercial Service Officers in these countries have regional responsibilities, this kind of coverage does not adequately service the needs of United States businesses attempting to do business in sub-Saharan Africa.
<br>
<br>(5) The Congress has, on several occasions, encouraged the Commercial Service to focus its resources and efforts in countries or regions in Europe or Asia to promote greater United States export activity in those markets, and similar encouragement should be provided for countries in sub-Saharan Africa as well.
<br>
<br>(6) Because market information is not widely available in many sub-Saharan African countries, the presence of additional Commercial Service Officers and resources can play a significant role in assisting United States businesses in markets in those countries.
<br>(b) Appointments
<br>
<br>Subject to the availability of appropriations, by not later than December 31, 2001, the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Director General of the United States and Foreign Commercial Service, shall take steps to ensure that—
<br>
<br>(1) at least 20 full-time Commercial Service employees are stationed in sub-Saharan Africa; and
<br>
<br>(2) full-time Commercial Service employees are stationed in not less than 10 different sub-Saharan African countries.
<br>(c) Initiative for sub-Saharan Africa
<br>
<br>In order to encourage the export of United States goods and services to sub-Saharan African countries, the International Trade Administration shall make a special effort to—
<br>
<br>(1) identify United States goods and services which are the best prospects for export by United States companies to sub-Saharan Africa;
<br>
<br>(2) identify, where appropriate, tariff and nontariff barriers that are preventing or hindering sales of United States goods and services to, or the operation of United States companies in, sub-Saharan Africa;
<br>
<br>(3) hold discussions with appropriate authorities in sub-Saharan Africa on the matters described in paragraphs (1) and (2) with a view to securing increased market access for United States exporters of goods and services;
<br>
<br>(4) identify current resource allocations and personnel levels in sub-Saharan Africa for the Commercial Service and consider plans for the deployment of additional resources or personnel to that region; and
<br>
<br>(5) make available to the public, through printed and electronic means of communication, the information derived pursuant to paragraphs (1) through (4) for each of the 4 years after May 18, 2000.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 106–200, title I, §125, May 18, 2000, 114 Stat. 270.)
<br>§3736. Donation of air traffic control equipment to eligible sub-Saharan African countries
<br>
<br>It is the sense of the Congress that, to the extent appropriate, the United States Government should make every effort to donate to governments of sub-Saharan African countries determined to be eligible under section 3703 of this title air traffic control equipment that is no longer in use, including appropriate related reimbursable technical assistance.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 106–200, title I, §126, May 18, 2000, 114 Stat. 271.)
<br>§3737. Additional authorities and increased flexibility to provide assistance under the Development Fund for Africa
<br>(a) Use of sustainable development assistance to support further economic growth
<br>
<br>It is the sense of the Congress that sustained economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa depends in large measure upon the development of a receptive environment for trade and investment, and that to achieve this objective the United States Agency for International Development should continue to support programs which help to create this environment. Investments in human resources, development, and implementation of free market policies, including policies to liberalize agricultural markets and improve food security, and the support for the rule of law and democratic governance should continue to be encouraged and enhanced on a bilateral and regional basis.
<br>(b) Declarations of policy
<br>
<br>The Congress makes the following declarations:
<br>
<br>(1) The Development Fund for Africa established under chapter 10 of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2293 et seq.) has been an effective tool in providing development assistance to sub-Saharan Africa since 1988.
<br>
<br>(2) The Development Fund for Africa will complement the other provisions of this chapter and lay a foundation for increased trade and investment opportunities between the United States and sub-Saharan Africa.
<br>
<br>(3) Assistance provided through the Development Fund for Africa will continue to support programs and activities that promote the long term economic development of sub-Saharan Africa, such as programs and activities relating to the following:
<br>
<br>(A) Strengthening primary and vocational education systems, especially the acquisition of middle-level technical skills for operating modern private businesses and the introduction of college level business education, including the study of international business, finance, and stock exchanges.
<br>
<br>(B) Strengthening health care systems.
<br>
<br>(C) Supporting democratization, good governance and civil society and conflict resolution efforts.
<br>
<br>(D) Increasing food security by promoting the expansion of agricultural and agriculture-based industrial production and productivity and increasing real incomes for poor individuals.
<br>
<br>(E) Promoting an enabling environment for private sector-led growth through sustained economic reform, privatization programs, and market-led economic activities.
