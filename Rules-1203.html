<br>
<br>The Congress finds and declares that the proliferation of nuclear explosive devices or of the direct capability to manufacture or otherwise acquire such devices poses a grave threat to the security interests of the United States and to continued international progress toward world peace and development. Recent events emphasize the urgency of this threat and the imperative need to increase the effectiveness of international safeguards and controls on peaceful nuclear activities to prevent proliferation. Accordingly, it is the policy of the United States to—
<br>
<br>(a) actively pursue through international initiatives mechanisms for fuel supply assurances and the establishment of more effective international controls over the transfer and use of nuclear materials and equipment and nuclear technology for peaceful purposes in order to prevent proliferation, including the establishment of common international sanctions;
<br>
<br>(b) take such actions as are required to confirm the reliability of the United States in meeting its commitments to supply nuclear reactors and fuel to nations which adhere to effective non-proliferation policies by establishing procedures to facilitate the timely processing of requests for subsequent arrangements and export licenses;
<br>
<br>(c) strongly encourage nations which have not ratified the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to do so at the earliest possible date; and
<br>
<br>(d) cooperate with foreign nations in identifying and adapting suitable technologies for energy production and, in particular, to identify alternative options to nuclear power in aiding such nations to meet their energy needs, consistent with the economic and material resources of those nations and environmental protection.

<br>"SEC. 3132. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE PREVENTION OF NUCLEAR TERRORISM.
<br>
<br>"It is the sense of Congress that—
<br>
<br>"(1) the President should make the prevention of a nuclear terrorist attack on the United States a high priority;
<br>
<br>"(2) the President should accelerate programs, requesting additional funding as appropriate, to prevent nuclear terrorism, including combating nuclear smuggling, securing and accounting for nuclear weapons, and eliminating, removing, or securing and accounting for formula quantities of strategic special nuclear material wherever such quantities may be;
<br>
<br>"(3) the United States, together with the international community, should take a comprehensive approach to reducing the danger of nuclear terrorism, including by making additional efforts to identify and eliminate terrorist groups that aim to acquire nuclear weapons, to ensure that nuclear weapons worldwide are secure and accounted for and that formula quantities of strategic special nuclear material worldwide are eliminated, removed, or secure and accounted for to a degree sufficient to defeat the threat that terrorists and criminals have shown they can pose, and to increase the ability to find and stop terrorist efforts to manufacture nuclear explosives or to transport nuclear explosives and materials anywhere in the world;
<br>
<br>"(4) within such a comprehensive approach, a high priority must be placed on ensuring that all nuclear weapons worldwide are secure and accounted for and that all formula quantities of strategic special nuclear material worldwide are eliminated, removed, or secure and accounted for; and
<br>
<br>"(5) the International Atomic Energy Agency should be funded appropriately to fulfill its role in coordinating international efforts to protect nuclear material and to combat nuclear smuggling.

<br>"(1) ensures that nuclear weapons and formula quantities of strategic special nuclear material are secure and accounted for to a sufficient level to defeat the threats posed by terrorists and criminals;
<br>
<br>"(2) takes into account the limitations of equipment and human performance; and
<br>
<br>"(3) includes steps to provide confidence that the needed measures have in fact been implemented.
<br>
<br>"(c) International Efforts.—It is the sense of Congress that, in furtherance of the policy described in subsection (a), the President, in consultation with relevant Federal departments and agencies, should—
<br>
<br>"(1) work with other countries and the International Atomic Energy Agency to assist as appropriate, and if necessary work to convince, the governments of any and all countries in possession of nuclear weapons or formula quantities of strategic special nuclear material to ensure that security is upgraded to meet the standard described in subsection (b) as rapidly as possible and in a manner that—
<br>
<br>"(A) accounts for the nature of the terrorist and criminal threat in each such country; and
<br>
<br>"(B) ensures that any measures to which the United States and any such country agree are sustained after United States and other international assistance ends;
<br>
<br>"(2) ensure that United States financial and technical assistance is available, as appropriate, to countries for which the provision of such assistance would accelerate the implementation of, or improve the effectiveness of, such security upgrades; and

<br>§3301. Congressional findings and declaration of policy
<br>(a) Findings
<br>
<br>The President having terminated governmental relations between the United States and the governing authorities on Taiwan recognized by the United States as the Republic of China prior to January 1, 1979, the Congress finds that the enactment of this chapter is necessary—
<br>
<br>(1) to help maintain peace, security, and stability in the Western Pacific; and
<br>
<br>(2) to promote the foreign policy of the United States by authorizing the continuation of commercial, cultural, and other relations between the people of the United States and the people on Taiwan.
<br>(b) Policy
<br>
<br>It is the policy of the United States—
<br>
<br>(1) to preserve and promote extensive, close, and friendly commercial, cultural, and other relations between the people of the United States and the people on Taiwan, as well as the people on the China mainland and all other peoples of the Western Pacific area;
<br>
<br>(2) to declare that peace and stability in the area are in the political, security, and economic interests of the United States, and are matters of international concern;
<br>
<br>(3) to make clear that the United States decision to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China rests upon the expectation that the future of Taiwan will be determined by peaceful means;
<br>
<br>(4) to consider any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means, including by boycotts or embargoes, a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to the United States;
<br>
<br>(5) to provide Taiwan with arms of a defensive character; and
<br>
<br>(6) to maintain the capacity of the United States to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security, or the social or economic system, of the people on Taiwan.
<br>(c) Human rights
<br>
<br>Nothing contained in this chapter shall contravene the interest of the United States in human rights, especially with respect to the human rights of all the approximately eighteen million inhabitants of Taiwan. The preservation and enhancement of the human rights of all the people on Taiwan are hereby reaffirmed as objectives of the United States.

<br>
<br>"(a) Statement of Policy.—It is the policy of the United States—
<br>
<br>"(1) that the Taiwan Relations Act (Public Law 96–8; 22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.) and the Six Assurances provided by the United States to Taiwan in July 1982 are the foundation for United States-Taiwan relations;
<br>
<br>"(2) to fully pursue the deepening of the extensive, close, and friendly relations of the United States and Taiwan pursuant to the Taiwan Relations Act (Public Law 96–8; 22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.), the intent of which is to facilitate greater cooperation and the broadening and deepening of United States-Taiwan relations;

<br>
<br>"(4) that, as set forth in the Taiwan Relations Act (Public Law 96–8; 22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.), the United States decision to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China rests upon the expectation that the future of Taiwan will be determined by peaceful means, and that any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means, including boycotts and embargoes, is a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to the United States;
<br>
<br>"(5) that the increasingly coercive and aggressive behavior of the People's Republic of China towards Taiwan is contrary to the expectation of the peaceful resolution of the future of Taiwan; and
<br>
<br>"(6) as set forth in the Taiwan Relations Act (Public Law 96–8; 22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.), to maintain the capacity to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security, or the social or economic system, of the people on Taiwan.
<br>
<br>"(b) Sense of Congress.—It is the sense of Congress that—
<br>
<br>"(1) the United States should continue to support the development of capable, ready, and modern defense forces necessary for Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability, including by—
<br>
<br>"(A) supporting acquisition by Taiwan of defense articles and services through foreign military sales, direct commercial sales, and industrial cooperation, with an emphasis on capabilities that support the asymmetric defense strategy of Taiwan, including anti-ship, coastal defense, anti-armor, air defense, undersea warfare, advanced command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, and resilient command and control capabilities;
<br>
<br>"(B) ensuring timely review of and response to requests of Taiwan for defense articles and services;
<br>
<br>"(C) conducting practical training and military exercises with Taiwan that enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability;
<br>
<br>"(D) examining the potential for expanding professional military education and technical training opportunities in the United States for military personnel of Taiwan;
<br>
<br>"(E) increasing exchanges between senior defense officials and general officers of the United States and Taiwan at the strategic, policy, and functional levels, consistent with the Taiwan Travel Act (Public Law 115–135; 132 Stat. 341), especially for the purposes of—
<br>
<br>"(i) enhancing cooperation on defense planning;
<br>
<br>"(ii) improving the interoperability of the military forces of the United States and Taiwan; and
<br>
<br>"(iii) improving the reserve force of Taiwan; and
<br>
<br>"(F) expanding cooperation in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief;
<br>
<br>"(2) the Secretary of State should ensure that any policy guidance related to United States-Taiwan relations is fully consistent with the statement of policy set forth in subsection (a);
<br>
<br>"(3) the Secretary of Defense should ensure that policy guidance related to United States-Taiwan defense relations is fully consistent with the statement of policy set forth in subsection (a); and
<br>
<br>"(4) the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and the heads of other Federal agencies and departments, as appropriate, should issue new guidance as required to carry out such policy."

<br>
<br>Pub. L. 116–260, div. FF, title III, §314, Dec. 27, 2020, 134 Stat. 3100, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(a) Sense of Congress.—It is the sense of Congress that the People's Republic of China's attempts to dictate the terms of Taiwan's participation in international organizations, has, in many cases, resulted in Taiwan's exclusion from such organizations even when statehood is not a requirement, and that such exclusion—
<br>
<br>"(1) is detrimental to global health, civilian air safety, and efforts to counter transnational crime;
<br>
<br>"(2) negatively impacts the safety and security of citizens globally; and
<br>
<br>"(3) negatively impacts the security of Taiwan and its democracy.
