<br>(2) Considerations
<br>
<br>In determining whether a financial market utility or payment, clearing, or settlement activity is, or is likely to become, systemically important, the Council shall take into consideration the following:
<br>
<br>(A) The aggregate monetary value of transactions processed by the financial market utility or carried out through the payment, clearing, or settlement activity.
<br>
<br>(B) The aggregate exposure of the financial market utility or a financial institution engaged in payment, clearing, or settlement activities to its counterparties.
<br>
<br>(C) The relationship, interdependencies, or other interactions of the financial market utility or payment, clearing, or settlement activity with other financial market utilities or payment, clearing, or settlement activities.
<br>

<br>
<br>The Council, on a nondelegable basis and by a vote of not fewer than 2/3 of members then serving, including an affirmative vote by the Chairperson of the Council, shall rescind a designation of systemic importance for a designated financial market utility or designated activity if the Council determines that the utility or activity no longer meets the standards for systemic importance.
<br>(2) Effect of rescission

<br>(D) Written submissions
<br>
<br>Upon receipt of a timely request, the Council shall fix a time, not more than 30 days after receipt of the request, unless extended at the request of the financial market utility or financial institution, and place at which the financial market utility or financial institution may appear, personally or through counsel, to submit written materials, or, at the sole discretion of the Council, oral testimony or oral argument.

<br>(B) Notice of waiver or modification
<br>
<br>The Council shall provide notice of the waiver or modification to the financial market utility concerned or, in the case of a payment, clearing, or settlement activity, to financial institutions, as soon as practicable, which shall be no later than 24 hours after the waiver or modification in the case of a financial market utility and 3 business days in the case of financial institutions.

<br>(2) Special procedures for designated clearing entities and designated activities of certain financial institutions
<br>(A) CFTC and Commission
<br>
<br>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Commission may each prescribe regulations, in consultation with the Council and the Board of Governors, containing risk management standards, taking into consideration relevant international standards and existing prudential requirements, for those designated clearing entities and financial institutions engaged in designated activities for which each is the Supervisory Agency or the appropriate financial regulator, governing—

<br>(C) Written determination
<br>
<br>Any determination by the Board of Governors under subparagraph (B) shall be provided in writing to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission or the Commission, as applicable, and the Council, and shall explain why existing prudential requirements, considered as a whole, are insufficient to ensure that the operations and activities of the designated clearing entities or the activities of financial institutions described in subparagraph (B) will not pose significant liquidity, credit, operational, or other risks to the financial markets or to the financial stability of the United States. The Board of Governors' determination shall contain a detailed analysis supporting its findings and identify the specific prudential requirements that are insufficient.
<br>(D) CFTC and Commission response
<br>
<br>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission or the Commission, as applicable, shall within 60 days either object to the Board of Governors' determination with a detailed analysis as to why existing prudential requirements are sufficient, or submit an explanation to the Council and the Board of Governors describing the actions to be taken in response to the Board of Governors' determination.
<br>(E) Authorization
<br>
<br>Upon an affirmative vote by not fewer than 2/3 of members then serving on the Council, the Council shall either find that the response submitted under subparagraph (D) is sufficient, or require the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or the Commission, as applicable, to prescribe such risk management standards as the Council determines is necessary to address the specific prudential requirements that are determined to be insufficient." 1
<br>(b) Objectives and principles
<br>
<br>The objectives and principles for the risk management standards prescribed under subsection (a) shall be to—

<br>(e) Threshold level
<br>

Any extension under this subparagraph will extend the time periods under subparagraphs (E) and (G).
<br>(I) Change allowed earlier if notified of no objection
<br>
<br>A designated financial market utility may implement a change in less than 60 days from the date of receipt of the notice of proposed change by the Supervisory Agency, or the date the Supervisory Agency receives any further information it requested, if the Supervisory Agency notifies the designated financial market utility in writing that it does not object to the proposed change and authorizes the designated financial market utility to implement the change on an earlier date, subject to any conditions imposed by the Supervisory Agency.
<br>(2) Emergency changes

<br>
<br>The Supervisory Agency shall provide the Board of Governors concurrently with a complete copy of any notice, request, or other information it issues, submits, or receives under this subsection.
<br>(4) Consultation with Board of Governors
<br>
<br>Before taking any action on, or completing its review of, a change proposed by a designated financial market utility, the Supervisory Agency shall consult with the Board of Governors.

<br>Editorial Notes
<br>References in Text
<br>
<br>The Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010, referred to in subsecs. (a) and (b), is title VII of Pub. L. 111–203, July 21, 2010, 124 Stat. 1641. Section 728 of the Act amended the act of Sept. 21, 1922, ch. 369, to add a new section 21 which is classified to section 24a of Title 7, Agriculture. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under section 8301 of Title 15, Commerce and Trade, and Tables.
<br>
<br>Section 745(b)(3) of the Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010, referred to in subsec. (a)(2), probably means section 5c(c)(3) of the Commodity Exchange Act, which is classified to section 7a–2(c)(3) of Title 7, Agriculture. Section 745(b) of the Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010, which is section 745(b) of Pub. L. 111–203, added subsec. (c) of section 7a–2 of Title 7 and struck out former subsec. (c) of that section. Section 7a–2(c)(3) of Title 7 relates to stays of the certification for rules. Section 745(b) of Pub. L. 111–203 does not contain a par. (3).
