<br>(F) De minimis waivers
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>The President may disregard subparagraph (A)(i)(II) with respect to any eligible article from any beneficiary developing country if the aggregate appraised value of the imports of such article into the United States during the preceding calendar year does not exceed the applicable amount for such preceding calendar year.
<br>(ii) Applicable amount
<br>
<br>For purposes of applying clause (i), the applicable amount is—
<br>
<br>(I) for calendar year 1996, $13,000,000, and

<br>(II) for each calendar year thereafter, an amount equal to the applicable amount in effect for the preceding calendar year plus $500,000.
<br>(d) Waiver of competitive need limitation
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The President may waive the application of subsection (c)(2) with respect to any eligible article of any beneficiary developing country if, before November 1 of the calendar year beginning after the calendar year for which a determination described in subsection (c)(2)(A) was made with respect to such eligible article, the President—
<br>
<br>(A) receives the advice of the International Trade Commission under section 1332 of this title on whether any industry in the United States is likely to be adversely affected by such waiver,
<br>
<br>(B) determines, based on the considerations described in sections 2461 and 2462(c) of this title and the advice described in subparagraph (A), that such waiver is in the national economic interest of the United States, and
<br>
<br>(C) publishes the determination described in subparagraph (B) in the Federal Register.
<br>(2) Considerations by the President
<br>
<br>In making any determination under paragraph (1), the President shall give great weight to—
<br>
<br>(A) the extent to which the beneficiary developing country has assured the United States that such country will provide equitable and reasonable access to the markets and basic commodity resources of such country, and
<br>
<br>(B) the extent to which such country provides adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights.
<br>(3) Other bases for waiver
<br>
<br>The President may waive the application of subsection (c)(2) if, before November 1 of the calendar year beginning after the calendar year for which a determination described in subsection (c)(2) was made with respect to a beneficiary developing country, the President determines that—
<br>
<br>(A) there has been a historical preferential trade relationship between the United States and such country,
<br>
<br>(B) there is a treaty or trade agreement in force covering economic relations between such country and the United States, and
<br>
<br>(C) such country does not discriminate against, or impose unjustifiable or unreasonable barriers to, United States commerce,
<br>
<br>and the President publishes that determination in the Federal Register.
<br>(4) Limitations on waivers
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The President may not exercise the waiver authority under this subsection with respect to a quantity of an eligible article entered during any calendar year beginning after 1995, the aggregate appraised value of which equals or exceeds 30 percent of the aggregate appraised value of all articles that entered duty-free under this subchapter during the preceding calendar year.
<br>(B) Other waiver limits
<br>
<br>(i) The President may not exercise the waiver authority provided under this subsection with respect to a quantity of an eligible article entered during any calendar year beginning after 1995, the aggregate appraised value of which exceeds 15 percent of the aggregate appraised value of all articles that have entered duty-free under this subchapter during the preceding calendar year from those beneficiary developing countries which for the preceding calendar year—
<br>
<br>(I) had a per capita gross national product (calculated on the basis of the best available information, including that of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development) of $5,000 or more; or
<br>
<br>(II) had exported (either directly or indirectly) to the United States a quantity of articles that was duty-free under this subchapter that had an aggregate appraised value of more than 10 percent of the aggregate appraised value of all articles that entered duty-free under this subchapter during that year.
<br>
<br>(ii) Not later than November 1 of each year, the President should revoke any waiver that has then been in effect with respect to an article for 5 years or more if the beneficiary developing country has exported to the United States (directly or indirectly) during the preceding calendar year a quantity of the article—
<br>
<br>(I) having an appraised value in excess of 1.5 times the applicable amount set forth in subsection (c)(2)(A)(ii) for that calendar year; or
<br>
<br>(II) exceeding 75 percent of the appraised value of the total imports of that article into the United States during that calendar year.
<br>(C) Calculation of limitations
<br>
<br>There shall be counted against the limitations imposed under subparagraphs (A) and (B) for any calendar year only that value of any eligible article of any country that—
<br>
<br>(i) entered duty-free under this subchapter during such calendar year; and
<br>
<br>(ii) is in excess of the value of that article that would have been so entered during such calendar year if the limitations under subsection (c)(2)(A) applied.
<br>(5) Effective period of waiver
<br>
<br>Any waiver granted under this subsection shall remain in effect until the President determines that such waiver is no longer warranted due to changed circumstances.
<br>(e) International Trade Commission advice
<br>
<br>Before designating articles as eligible articles under subsection (a)(1), the President shall publish and furnish the International Trade Commission with lists of articles which may be considered for designation as eligible articles for purposes of this subchapter. The provisions of sections 2151, 2152, 2153, and 2154 of this title shall be complied with as though action under section 2461 of this title and this section were action under section 2133 of this title to carry out a trade agreement entered into under section 2133 of this title.
<br>(f) Special rule concerning Puerto Rico
<br>

<br>The President may provide duty-free treatment for any article described in section 2463(b)(1)(B) through (G) of this title that is the growth, product, or manufacture of a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country described in subsection (a), if, after receiving the advice of the International Trade Commission in accordance with section 2463(e) of this title, the President determines that such article is not import-sensitive in the context of imports from beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries.
<br>(2) Rules of origin
<br>
<br>The duty-free treatment provided under paragraph (1) shall apply to any article described in that paragraph that meets the requirements of section 2463(a)(2) of this title, except that—

<br>(2) Notification
<br>
<br>The President may not withdraw, suspend, or limit the application of duty-free treatment under paragraph (1) unless, at least 60 days before such withdrawal, suspension, or limitation, the President notifies Congress and notifies the country of the President's intention to withdraw, suspend, or limit such duty-free treatment, together with the considerations entering into the decision to terminate such designation.

<br>
<br>(4) The term "ad valorem equivalent" means the ad valorem equivalent of a specific rate or, in the case of a combination of rates including a specific rate, the sum of the ad valorem equivalent of the specific rate and of the ad valorem rate. The ad valorem equivalent shall be determined by the President on the basis of the value of imports of the article concerned during the most recent representative period. In determining the value of imports, the President shall utilize, to the maximum extent practicable, the standards of valuation contained in section 1401a or 1402 1 of this title (as in effect before the effective date of the amendments made by title II of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979) or in section 1401a of this title (as in effect on the effective date of such title II amendments) whichever is applicable to the article concerned during such representative period.
<br>
<br>(5) An imported article is "directly competitive with" a domestic article at an earlier or later stage of processing, and a domestic article is "directly competitive with" an imported article at an earlier or later stage of processing, if the importation of the article has an economic effect on producers of the domestic article comparable to the effect of importation of articles in the same stage of processing as the domestic article. For purposes of this paragraph, the unprocessed article is at an earlier stage of processing.
<br>
<br>(6) The term "modification", as applied to any duty or other import restriction, includes the elimination of any duty or other import restriction.

<br>Clarification of Designation of Normal Trade Relations
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 105–206, title V, §5003(a), July 22, 1998, 112 Stat. 789, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(1) Findings.—The Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>"(A) Since the 18th century, the principle of nondiscrimination among countries with which the United States has trade relations, commonly referred to as 'most-favored-nation' treatment, has been a cornerstone of United States trade policy.
<br>
<br>"(B) Although the principle remains firmly in place as a fundamental concept in United States trade relations, the term 'most-favored-nation' is a misnomer which has led to public misunderstanding.
<br>
<br>"(C) It is neither the purpose nor the effect of the most-favored-nation principle to treat any country as 'most favored'. To the contrary, the principle reflects the intention to confer on a country the same trade benefits that are conferred on any other country, that is, the intention not to discriminate among trading partners.
<br>
<br>"(D) The term 'normal trade relations' is a more accurate description of the principle of nondiscrimination as it applies to the tariffs applicable generally to imports from United States trading partners, that is, the general rates of duty set forth in column 1 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States.
<br>
<br>"(2) Policy.—It is the sense of the Congress that—
<br>
<br>"(A) the language used in United States laws, treaties, agreements, executive orders, directives, and regulations should more clearly and accurately reflect the underlying principles of United States trade policy; and
<br>
<br>"(B) accordingly, the term 'normal trade relations' should, where appropriate, be substituted for the term 'most-favored-nation'."

<br>Delegation of Functions
<br>
<br>Authority of President under this section to embody rectifications, technical or conforming changes, or similar modifications in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule delegated to the United States Trade Representative by par. (4) of Proc. No. 6969, Jan. 27, 1997, 62 F.R. 4417.
<br>Proc. No. 6914. To Modify the Allocation of Tariff-Rate Quotas for Certain Cheeses
<br>
<br>Proc. No. 6914, Aug. 26, 1996, 61 F.R. 45851, provided:
<br>
<br>1. On January 1, 1995, Austria, Finland, and Sweden acceded to the European Communities (EC), and the EC customs union of 12 member countries ("EC-12") was enlarged to a customs union of 15 member countries ("EC-15"). At that time, the EC-12, Austria, Finland, and Sweden withdrew their tariff schedules under the World Trade Organization and applied the common external tariff of the EC-12 to imports into the EC-15. The United States and the EC then entered into negotiations under Article XXIV:6 and Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 to compensate the United States for the resulting increase in some tariffs on U.S. exports to Austria, Finland, and Sweden.
<br>
<br>2. On July 22, 1996, the United States and the EC signed an agreement concluding the negotiations on compensation. To recognize the membership of Austria, Finland, and Sweden in the EC-15, the tariff-rate quota (TRQ) allocations for cheeses from these countries will become part of the total TRQ allocations for cheeses from the EC-15, but will be reserved for use by these countries through 1997.
<br>
<br>3. Section 404(d)(3) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA) (19 U.S.C. 3601(d)(3)) authorizes the President to allocate the in-quota quantity of a tariff-rate quota for any agricultural product among supplying countries or customs areas and to modify any allocation as the President determines appropriate. Pursuant to section 404(d)(3) of the URAA, I have determined that it is appropriate to modify the TRQ allocations for cheeses by providing that the TRQ allocations for cheeses from Austria, Finland, and Sweden will become part of the total TRQ allocations for cheeses from the EC-15, but will be reserved for use by these countries through 1997.
<br>
<br>4. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended ("Trade Act") (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, and of other Acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. The modification of the TRQ allocations for cheeses is such an action.
<br>
<br>5. In paragraph (3) of Proclamation 6763 of December 23, 1994, I delegated my authority under section 404(d)(3) of the Trade Act [probably means section 404(d)(3) of the URAA, 19 U.S.C. 3601(d)(3)] to the United States Trade Representative (USTR). I have determined that it is appropriate to authorize the USTR to exercise my authority under section 604 of the Trade Act [19 U.S.C. 2483] to embody in the HTS the substance of any action taken by the USTR under section 404(d)(3) of the URAA.
<br>
<br>NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including but not limited to section 301 of title 3, United States Code, section 404(d)(3) of the URAA, and section 604 of the Trade Act do proclaim that:
<br>
<br>(1) Additional U.S. notes to chapter 4 of the HTS are modified as specified in the Annex to this proclamation.
<br>
<br>(2) The USTR is authorized to exercise my authority under section 604 of the Trade Act [19 U.S.C. 2483] to embody in the HTS the substance of any actions taken by USTR under section 404(d)(3) of the URAA [19 U.S.C. 3601(d)(3)].
<br>
<br>(3) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive orders that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
<br>
<br>(4) This proclamation is effective on the date of signature of this proclamation, and the modifications to the HTS made by the Annex to this proclamation shall be effective on the dates that are specified in that Annex.
<br>
<br>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of August, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-first.
<br>
<br>William J. Clinton.

<br>§2484. International drug control

<br>SUBCHAPTER VII—TARIFF TREATMENT OF PRODUCTS OF, AND OTHER SANCTIONS AGAINST, UNCOOPERATIVE MAJOR DRUG PRODUCING OR DRUG-TRANSIT COUNTRIES
<br>§2491. Short title
<br>
<br>This subchapter may be cited as the "Narcotics Control Trade Act".
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 93–618, title VIII, §801, as added Pub. L. 99–570, title IX, §9001, Oct. 27, 1986, 100 Stat. 3207–164.)
<br>§2492. Tariff treatment of products of uncooperative major drug producing or drug-transit countries
<br>(a) Required action by President
<br>
<br>Subject to subsection (b), for every major drug producing country and every major drug-transit country, the President shall, on or after March 1, 1987, and March 1 of each succeeding year, to the extent considered necessary by the President to achieve the purposes of this subchapter—
<br>
<br>(1) deny to any or all of the products of that country tariff treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences, the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act [19 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.], or any other law providing preferential tariff treatment;
<br>
<br>(2) apply to any or all of the dutiable products of that country an additional duty at a rate not to exceed 50 percent ad valorem or the specific rate equivalent;
<br>
<br>(3) apply to one or more duty-free products of that country a duty at a rate not to exceed 50 percent ad valorem;
<br>
<br>(4) take the steps described in subsection (d)(1) or (d)(2), or both, to curtail air transportation between the United States and that country;
<br>
<br>(5) withdraw the personnel and resources of the United States from participation in any arrangement with that country for the pre-clearance of customs by visitors between the United States and that country; or
<br>
<br>(6) take any combination of the actions described in paragraphs (1) through (5).
<br>(b) Certifications; Congressional action
<br>
<br>(1)(A) Subject to paragraph (3), subsection (a) shall not apply with respect to a country if the President determines and certifies to the Congress, at the time of the submission of the report required by section 2291h of title 22, that—
<br>
<br>(i) during the previous year the country has cooperated fully with the United States, or has taken adequate steps on its own—
<br>
<br>(I) in satisfying the goals agreed to in an applicable bilateral narcotics agreement with the United States (as described in paragraph (B)) or a multilateral agreement which achieves the objectives of paragraph (B),
<br>
<br>(II) in preventing narcotic and psychotropic drugs and other controlled substances produced or processed, in whole or in part, in such country or transported through such country, from being sold illegally within the jurisdiction of such country to United States Government personnel or their dependents or from being transported, directly or indirectly, into the United States,
<br>
<br>(III) in preventing and punishing the laundering in that country of drug-related profits or drug-related moneys, and
<br>
<br>(IV) in preventing and punishing bribery and other forms of public corruption which facilitate the illicit production, processing, or shipment of narcotic and psychotropic drugs and other controlled substances, or which discourage the investigation and prosecution of such acts; or
<br>
<br>(ii) for a country that would not otherwise qualify for certification under clause (i), the vital national interests of the United States require that subsection (a) not be applied with respect to that country.
<br>
<br>(B) A bilateral narcotics agreement referred to in subparagraph (A)(i)(I) is an agreement between the United States and a foreign country in which the foreign country agrees to take specific activities, including, where applicable, efforts to—
<br>
<br>(i) reduce drug production, drug consumption, and drug trafficking within its territory, including activities to address illicit crop eradication and crop substitution;
<br>
<br>(ii) increase drug interdiction and enforcement;
<br>
<br>(iii) increase drug education and treatment programs;
<br>
<br>(iv) increase the identification of and elimination of illicit drug laboratories;
<br>
<br>(v) increase the identification and elimination of the trafficking of essential precursor chemicals for the use in production of illegal drugs;
<br>
<br>(vi) increase cooperation with United States drug enforcement officials; and
<br>
<br>(vii) where applicable, increase participation in extradition treaties, mutual legal assistance provisions directed at money laundering, sharing of evidence, and other initiatives for cooperative drug enforcement.
<br>
<br>(C) A country which in the previous year was designated as a major drug producing country or a major drug-transit country may not be determined to be cooperating fully under subparagraph (A)(i) unless it has in place a bilateral narcotics agreement with the United States or a multilateral agreement which achieves the objectives of subparagraph (B).
<br>
<br>(D) If the President makes a certification with respect to a country pursuant to subparagraph (A)(ii), he shall include in such certification—
<br>
<br>(i) a full and complete description of the vital national interests placed at risk if action is taken pursuant to subsection (a) with respect to that country; and
<br>
<br>(ii) a statement weighing the risk described in clause (i) against the risks posed to the vital national interests of the United States by the failure of such country to cooperate fully with the United States in combating narcotics or to take adequate steps to combat narcotics on its own.
<br>
<br>(E) The President may make a certification under subparagraph (A)(i) with respect to a major drug producing country or drug-transit country which is also a producer of licit opium only if the President determines that such country has taken steps to prevent significant diversion of its licit cultivation and production into the illicit market, maintains production and stockpiles at levels no higher than those consistent with licit market demand, and prevents illicit cultivation and production.
<br>
<br>(2) In determining whether to make the certification required by paragraph (1) with respect to a country, the President shall consider the following:
<br>
<br>(A) Have the actions of the government of that country resulted in the maximum reductions in illicit drug production which were determined to be achievable pursuant to section 2291(e)(4) 1 of title 22? In the case of a major drug producing country, the President shall give foremost consideration, in determining whether to make the certification required by paragraph (1), to whether the government of that country has taken actions which have resulted in such reductions.
<br>
<br>(B) Has that government taken the legal and law enforcement measures to enforce in its territory, to the maximum extent possible, the elimination of illicit cultivation and the suppression of illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in narcotic and psychotropic drugs and other controlled substances, as evidenced by seizures of such drugs and substances and of illicit laboratories and the arrest and prosecution of violators involved in the traffic in such drugs and substances significantly affecting the United States?
<br>
<br>(C) Has that government taken the legal and law enforcement steps necessary to eliminate, to the maximum extent possible, the laundering in that country of drug-related profits or drug-related moneys, as evidenced by—
<br>
<br>(i) the enactment and enforcement by that government of laws prohibiting such conduct,
<br>
<br>(ii) that government entering into, and cooperating under the terms of, mutual legal assistance agreements with the United States governing (but not limited to) money laundering, and
<br>
<br>(iii) the degree to which that government otherwise cooperates with United States law enforcement authorities on anti-money laundering efforts?
<br>
<br>(D) Has that government taken the legal and law enforcement steps necessary to eliminate, to the maximum extent possible, bribery and other forms of public corruption which facilitate the illicit production, processing, or shipment of narcotic and psychotropic drugs and other controlled substances, or which discourage the investigation and prosecution of such acts, as evidenced by the enactment and enforcement of laws prohibiting such conduct?
<br>
<br>(E) Has that government, as a matter of government policy, encouraged or facilitated the production or distribution of illicit narcotic and psychotropic drugs and other controlled substances?
<br>
<br>(F) Does any senior official of that government engage in, encourage, or facilitate the production or distribution of illicit narcotic and psychotropic drugs and other controlled substances?
<br>
<br>(G) Has that government investigated aggressively all cases in which any member of an agency of the United States Government engaged in drug enforcement activities since January 1, 1985, has been the victim of acts or threats of violence, inflicted by or with the complicity of any law enforcement or other officer of such country or any political subdivision thereof, and has energetically sought to bring the perpetrators of such offense or offenses to justice?
<br>
<br>(H) Having been requested to do so by the United States Government, does that government fail to provide reasonable cooperation to lawful activities of United States drug enforcement agents, including the refusal of permission to such agents engaged in interdiction of aerial smuggling into the United States to pursue suspected aerial smugglers a reasonable distance into the airspace of the requested country?
<br>
<br>(I) Has that government made necessary changes in legal codes in order to enable law enforcement officials to move more effectively against narcotics traffickers, such as new conspiracy laws and new asset seizure laws?
<br>
<br>(J) Has that government expeditiously processed United States extradition requests relating to narcotics trafficking?
<br>
<br>(K) Has that government refused to protect or give haven to any known drug traffickers, and has it expeditiously processed extradition requests relating to narcotics trafficking made by other countries?
<br>
<br>(3) Subsection (a) shall apply to a country without regard to paragraph (1) of this subsection if the Congress enacts, within 45 days of continuous session after receipt of a certification under paragraph (1), a joint resolution disapproving the determination of the President contained in that certification.
<br>
<br>(4) If the President takes action under subsection (a), that action shall remain in effect until—
<br>
<br>(A) the President makes the certification under paragraph (1), a period of 45 days of continuous session of Congress elapses, and during that period the Congress does not enact a joint resolution of disapproval; or
<br>
<br>(B) the President submits at any other time a certification of the matters described in paragraph (1) with respect to that country, a period of 45 days of continuous session of Congress elapses, and during that period the Congress does not enact a joint resolution of disapproving the determination contained in that certification.
<br>
<br>(5) For the purpose of expediting the consideration and enactment of joint resolutions under paragraphs (3) and (4)—
<br>
<br>(A) a motion to proceed to the consideration of any such joint resolution after it has been reported by the Committee on Ways and Means shall be treated as highly privileged in the House of Representatives; and
<br>
<br>(B) a motion to proceed to the consideration of any such joint resolution after it has been reported by the Committee on Finance shall be treated as privileged in the Senate.
<br>(c) Duration of action
<br>
<br>The action taken by the President under paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of subsection (a) shall apply to the products of a foreign country that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, during the period that such action is in effect.
<br>(d) Presidential action regarding aviation
<br>
<br>(1)(A) The President is authorized to notify the government of a country against which is imposed the sanction described in subsection (a)(4) of his intention to suspend the authority of foreign air carriers owned or controlled by the government or nationals of that country to engage in foreign air transportation to or from the United States.
<br>
<br>(B) Within 10 days after the date of notification of a government under subparagraph (A), the Secretary of Transportation shall take all steps necessary to suspend at the earliest possible date the authority of any foreign air carrier owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by the government or nationals of that country to engage in foreign air transportation to or from the United States, notwithstanding any agreement relating to air services.
<br>
<br>(C) The President may also direct the Secretary of Transportation to take such steps as may be necessary to suspend the authority of any air carrier to engage in foreign air transportation between the United States and that country.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) The President may direct the Secretary of State to terminate any air service agreement between the United States and a country against which the sanction described in subsection (a)(4) is imposed in accordance with the provisions of that agreement.
<br>
<br>(B) Upon termination of an agreement under this paragraph, the Secretary of Transportation shall take such steps as may be necessary to revoke at the earliest possible date the right of any foreign air carrier owned, or controlled, directly or indirectly, by the government or nationals of that country to engage in foreign air transportation to or from the United States.
<br>
<br>(C) Upon termination of an agreement under this paragraph, the Secretary of Transportation may also revoke the authority of any air carrier to engage in foreign air transportation between the United States and that country.
<br>
<br>(3) The Secretary of Transportation may provide for such exceptions from paragraphs (1) and (2) as the Secretary considers necessary to provide for emergencies in which the safety of an aircraft or its crew or passengers is threatened.
<br>
<br>(4) For purposes of this subsection, the terms "air transportation", "air carrier", "foreign air carrier" and "foreign air transportation" have the meanings such terms have under section 40102(a) of title 49.
<br>(e) Standards and guidelines for determining major drug-transit countries
<br>
<br>For each calendar year, the Secretary of State, after consultation with the appropriate committees of the Congress, shall establish numerical standards and other guidelines for determining which countries will be considered to be major drug-transit countries under section 2495(3)(A) and (B) of this title.
