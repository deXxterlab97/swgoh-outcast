<br>
<br>(3) When Service Is Complete. Service by electronic means is complete on filing or sending, unless the person making service receives notice that the document was not received by the person served. Service by mail or by commercial carrier is complete on mailing or delivery to the carrier.
<br>
<br>(d) Proof of Service.
<br>
<br>(1) What Is Required. A document presented for filing must contain either of the following if it was served other than through the court's electronic-filing system:
<br>
<br>(A) an acknowledgment of service by the person served; or
<br>
<br>(B) proof of service consisting of a statement by the person who made service certifying:
<br>
<br>(i) the date and manner of service;
<br>
<br>(ii) the names of the persons served; and
<br>
<br>(iii) the mail or electronic address, the fax number, or the address of the place of delivery, as appropriate for the manner of service, for each person served.
<br>
<br>(2) Delayed Proof. The district or BAP clerk may permit documents to be filed without acknowledgment or proof of service, but must require the acknowledgment or proof to be filed promptly thereafter.
<br>
<br>(3) Brief or Appendix. When a brief or appendix is filed, the proof of service must also state the date and manner by which it was filed.
<br>
<br>(e) Signature. Every document filed electronically must include the electronic signature of the person filing it or, if the person is represented, the electronic signature of counsel. A filing made through a person's electronic-filing account and authorized by that person, together with that person's name on a signature block, constitutes the person's signature. Every document filed in paper form must be signed by the person filing the document or, if the person is represented, by counsel.

<br>Prior Rule
<br>
<br>A prior Rule 8011, Apr. 25, 1983, eff. Aug. 1, 1983, related to motions, prior to revision of Part VIII, Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.
<br>Committee Notes on Rules—2014
<br>
<br>This rule is derived from former Rule 8008 and F.R.App.P. 25. It adopts some of the additional details of the appellate rule, and it provides greater recognition of the possibility of electronic filing and service.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (a) governs the filing of documents in the district court or BAP. Consistent with other provisions of these Part VIII rules, subdivision (a)(2) requires electronic filing of documents, including briefs and appendices, unless the district court's or BAP's procedures permit or require other methods of delivery to the court. An electronic filing is timely if it is received by the district or BAP clerk within the time fixed for filing. No additional copies need to be submitted when documents are filed electronically, by mail, or by delivery unless the district court or BAP requires them.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (a)(3) provides that the district or BAP clerk may not refuse to accept a document for filing solely because its form does not comply with these rules or any local rule or practice. The district court or BAP may, however, direct the correction of any deficiency in any document that does not conform to the requirements of these rules or applicable local rules, and may prescribe such other relief as the court deems appropriate.
<br>
<br>Subdivisions (b) and (c) address the service of documents in the district court or BAP. Except for documents that the district or BAP clerk must serve, a party that makes a filing must serve copies of the document on the other parties to the appeal. Service on represented parties must be made on counsel. Subdivision (c) expresses the general requirement under these Part VIII rules that documents be sent electronically. See Rule 8001(c). Local court rules, however, may provide for other means of service, and subdivision (c) specifies non-electronic methods of service by or on an unrepresented party. Electronic service is complete upon transmission, unless the party making service receives notice that the transmission did not reach the person intended to be served in a readable form.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (d) retains the former rule's provisions regarding proof of service of a document filed in the district court or BAP. In addition, it provides that a certificate of service must state the mail or electronic address or fax number to which service was made.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (e) is a new provision that requires an electronic signature of counsel or an unrepresented filer for documents that are filed electronically in the district court or BAP. A local rule may specify a method of providing an electronic signature that is consistent with any standards established by the Judicial Conference of the United States. Paper copies of documents filed in the district court or BAP must bear an actual signature of counsel or the filer. By requiring a signature, subdivision (e) ensures that a readily identifiable attorney or party takes responsibility for every document that is filed.
<br>
<br>Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes were made after publication and comment.
<br>Committee Notes on Rules—2018 Amendment
<br>
<br>The rule is amended to conform to the amendments to F.R.App.P. 25 on inmate filing, electronic filing, signature, service, and proof of service.
<br>
<br>Consistent with Rule 8001(c), subdivision (a)(2) generally makes electronic filing mandatory. The rule recognizes exceptions for persons proceeding without an attorney, exceptions for good cause, and variations established by local rule.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (a)(2)(A)(iii) is revised to conform to F.R.App.P. 25(a)(2)(A)(iii), which was recently amended to streamline and clarify the operation of the inmate-filing rule. The rule requires the inmate to show timely deposit and prepayment of postage. It is amended to specify that a notice is timely if it is accompanied by a declaration or notarized statement stating the date the notice was deposited in the institution's mail system and attesting to the prepayment of first-class postage. The declaration must state that first-class postage "is being prepaid," not (as directed by the former rule) that first-class postage "has been prepaid." This change reflects the fact that inmates may need to rely upon the institution to affix postage after the inmate has deposited the document in the institution's mail system. A new Director's Form sets out a suggested form of the declaration.
<br>
<br>The amended rule also provides that a notice is timely without a declaration or notarized statement if other evidence accompanying the notice shows that the notice was deposited on or before the due date and that postage was prepaid. If the notice is not accompanied by evidence that establishes timely deposit and prepayment of postage, then the appellate court—district court, BAP, or court of appeals in the case of a direct appeal—has discretion to accept a declaration or notarized statement at a later date. The rule uses the phrase "exercises its discretion to permit"—rather than simply "permits"—to help ensure that pro se inmates are aware that a court will not necessarily forgive a failure to provide the declaration initially.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (c) is amended to authorize electronic service by means of the court's electronic-filing system on registered users without requiring their written consent. All other forms of electronic service require the written consent of the person served.
<br>
<br>Service is complete when a person files the paper with the court's electronic-filing system for transmission to a registered user, or when one person sends it to another person by other electronic means that the other person has consented to in writing. But service is not effective if the person who filed with the court or the person who sent by other agreed-upon electronic means receives notice that the paper did not reach the person to be served. The rule does not make the court responsible for notifying a person who filed the paper with the court's electronic-filing system that an attempted transmission by the court's system failed. But a filer who receives notice that the transmission failed is responsible for making effective service.
<br>
<br>As amended, subdivision (d) eliminates the requirement of proof of service when service is made through the electronic-filing system. The notice of electronic filing generated by the system serves that purpose.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (e) requires the signature of counsel or an unrepresented party on every document that is filed. A filing made through a person's electronic-filing account and authorized by that person, together with that person's name on a signature block, constitutes the person's signature. A person's electronic-filing account means an account established by the court for use of the court's electronic-filing system, which account the person accesses with the user name and password (or other credentials) issued to that person by the court.
<br>Rule 8012. Disclosure Statement
<br>
<br>(a) Nongovernmental Corporations. Any nongovernmental corporation that is a party to a proceeding in the district court or BAP must file a statement that identifies any parent corporation and any publicly held corporation that owns 10% or more of its stock or states that there is no such corporation. The same requirement applies to a nongovernmental corporation that seeks to intervene.
<br>
<br>(b) Disclosure About the Debtor. The debtor, the trustee, or, if neither is a party, the appellant must file a statement that:
<br>
<br>(1) identifies each debtor not named in the caption; and
<br>
<br>(2) for each debtor that is a corporation, discloses the information required by Rule 8012(a).
<br>
<br>(c) Time to File; Supplemental Filing. A Rule 8012 statement must:
<br>
<br>(1) be filed with the principal brief or upon filing a motion, response, petition, or answer in the district court or BAP, whichever occurs first, unless a local rule requires earlier filing;
<br>
<br>(2) be included before the table of contents in the principal brief; and
<br>
<br>(3) be supplemented whenever the information required by Rule 8012 changes.
<br>
<br>(Added Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014; amended Apr. 27, 2020, eff. Dec. 1, 2020.)
<br>Prior Rule
<br>
<br>A prior Rule 8012, Apr. 25, 1983, eff. Aug. 1, 1983, related to oral argument, prior to revision of Part VIII, Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.
<br>Committee Notes on Rules—2014
<br>
<br>This rule is derived from F.R.App.P. 26.1. It requires the filing of corporate disclosure statements and supplemental statements in order to assist district court and BAP judges in determining whether they should recuse themselves. Rule 9001 makes the definitions in §101 of the Code applicable to these rules. Under §101(9) the word "corporation" includes a limited liability company, limited liability partnership, business trust, and certain other entities that are not designated under applicable law as corporations.
<br>
<br>If filed separately from a brief, motion, response, petition, or answer, the statement must be filed and served in accordance with Rule 8011. Under Rule 8015(a)(7)(B)(iii), the corporate disclosure statement is not included in calculating applicable word-count limitations.
<br>
<br>Changes Made After Publication and Comment. A sentence was added to the Committee Note to draw attention to the broad definition of "corporation" under §101(9) of the Bankruptcy Code.
<br>Committee Notes on Rules—2020 Amendment
<br>
<br>The rule is amended to conform to recent amendments to F.R.App.P. 26.1. Subdivision (a) is amended to encompass nongovernmental corporations that seek to intervene on appeal.
<br>
<br>New subdivision (b) requires disclosure of the name of all of the debtors in the bankruptcy case. The names of the debtors are not always included in the caption of appeals. It also requires, for corporate debtors, disclosure of the same information required to be disclosed under subdivision (a).
<br>
<br>Subdivision (c), previously subdivision (b), now applies to all the disclosure requirements in Rule 8012.
<br>Rule 8013. Motions; Intervention
<br>
<br>(a) Contents of a Motion; Response; Reply.
<br>
<br>(1) Request for Relief. A request for an order or other relief is made by filing a motion with the district or BAP clerk.
<br>
<br>(2) Contents of a Motion.
<br>
<br>(A) Grounds and the Relief Sought. A motion must state with particularity the grounds for the motion, the relief sought, and the legal argument necessary to support it.
<br>
<br>(B) Motion to Expedite an Appeal. A motion to expedite an appeal must explain what justifies considering the appeal ahead of other matters. If the district court or BAP grants the motion, it may accelerate the time to transmit the record, the deadline for filing briefs and other documents, oral argument, and the resolution of the appeal. A motion to expedite an appeal may be filed as an emergency motion under subdivision (d).
<br>
<br>(C) Accompanying Documents.
<br>
<br>(i) Any affidavit or other document necessary to support a motion must be served and filed with the motion.
<br>
<br>(ii) An affidavit must contain only factual information, not legal argument.
<br>
<br>(iii) A motion seeking substantive relief must include a copy of the bankruptcy court's judgment, order, or decree, and any accompanying opinion as a separate exhibit.
<br>
<br>(D) Documents Barred or Not Required.
<br>
<br>(i) A separate brief supporting or responding to a motion must not be filed.
<br>
<br>(ii) Unless the court orders otherwise, a notice of motion or a proposed order is not required.
<br>
<br>(3) Response and Reply; Time to File. Unless the district court or BAP orders otherwise,
<br>
<br>(A) any party to the appeal may file a response to the motion within 7 days after service of the motion; and
<br>
<br>(B) the movant may file a reply to a response within 7 days after service of the response, but may only address matters raised in the response.
<br>
<br>(b) Disposition of a Motion for a Procedural Order. The district court or BAP may rule on a motion for a procedural order—including a motion under Rule 9006(b) or (c)—at any time without awaiting a response. A party adversely affected by the ruling may move to reconsider, vacate, or modify it within 7 days after the procedural order is served.
<br>
<br>(c) Oral Argument. A motion will be decided without oral argument unless the district court or BAP orders otherwise.
<br>
<br>(d) Emergency Motion.
<br>
<br>(1) Noting the Emergency. When a movant requests expedited action on a motion because irreparable harm would occur during the time needed to consider a response, the movant must insert the word "Emergency" before the title of the motion.
<br>
<br>(2) Contents of the Motion. The emergency motion must
<br>
<br>(A) be accompanied by an affidavit setting out the nature of the emergency;
<br>
<br>(B) state whether all grounds for it were submitted to the bankruptcy court and, if not, why the motion should not be remanded for the bankruptcy court to consider;
<br>
<br>(C) include the e-mail addresses, office addresses, and telephone numbers of moving counsel and, when known, of opposing counsel and any unrepresented parties to the appeal; and
<br>
<br>(D) be served as prescribed by Rule 8011.
<br>
<br>(3) Notifying Opposing Parties. Before filing an emergency motion, the movant must make every practicable effort to notify opposing counsel and any unrepresented parties in time for them to respond. The affidavit accompanying the emergency motion must state when and how notice was given or state why giving it was impracticable.
<br>
<br>(e) Power of a Single BAP Judge to Entertain a Motion.
<br>
<br>(1) Single Judge's Authority. A BAP judge may act alone on any motion, but may not dismiss or otherwise determine an appeal, deny a motion for leave to appeal, or deny a motion for a stay pending appeal if denial would make the appeal moot.
<br>
<br>(2) Reviewing a Single Judge's Action. The BAP may review a single judge's action, either on its own motion or on a party's motion.
<br>
<br>(f) Form of Documents; Length Limits; Number of Copies.
<br>
<br>(1) Format of a Paper Document. Rule 27(d)(1) F.R.App.P. applies in the district court or BAP to a paper version of a motion, response, or reply.
<br>
<br>(2) Format of an Electronically Filed Document. A motion, response, or reply filed electronically must comply with the requirements for a paper version regarding covers, line spacing, margins, typeface, and type style. It must also comply with the length limits under paragraph (3).
<br>
<br>(3) Length Limits. Except by the district court's or BAP's permission, and excluding the accompanying documents authorized by subdivision (a)(2)(C):
<br>
<br>(A) a motion or a response to a motion produced using a computer must include a certificate under Rule 8015(h) and not exceed 5,200 words;
<br>
<br>(B) a handwritten or typewritten motion or a response to a motion must not exceed 20 pages;
<br>
<br>(C) a reply produced using a computer must include a certificate under Rule 8015(h) and not exceed 2,600 words; and
<br>
<br>(D) a handwritten or typewritten reply must not exceed 10 pages.
<br>
<br>(4) Paper Copies. Paper copies must be provided only if required by local rule or by an order in a particular case.
<br>
<br>(g) Intervening in an Appeal. Unless a statute provides otherwise, an entity that seeks to intervene in an appeal pending in the district court or BAP must move for leave to intervene and serve a copy of the motion on the parties to the appeal. The motion or other notice of intervention authorized by statute must be filed within 30 days after the appeal is docketed. It must concisely state the movant's interest, the grounds for intervention, whether intervention was sought in the bankruptcy court, why intervention is being sought at this stage of the proceeding, and why participating as an amicus curiae would not be adequate.
<br>
<br>(Added Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014; amended Apr. 26, 2018, eff. Dec. 1, 2018; Apr. 27, 2020, eff. Dec. 1, 2020.)
<br>Prior Rule
<br>
<br>A prior Rule 8013, Apr. 25, 1983, eff. Aug. 1, 1983, as amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987, related to disposition of appeal and weight accorded bankruptcy judge's findings of fact, prior to revision of Part VIII, Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.
<br>Committee Notes on Rules—2014
<br>
<br>This rule is derived from former Rule 8011 and F.R.App.P. 15(d) and 27. It adopts many of the provisions of the appellate rules that specify the form and page limits of motions and accompanying documents, while also adjusting those requirements for electronic filing. In addition, it prescribes the procedure for seeking to intervene in the district court or BAP.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (a) retains much of the content of former Rule 8011(a) regarding the contents of a motion, response, and reply. It also specifies the documents that may accompany a motion. Unlike the former rule, which allowed the filing of separate briefs supporting a motion, subdivision (a) now adopts the practice of F.R.App.P. 27(a) of prohibiting the filing of briefs supporting or responding to a motion. The motion or response itself must include the party's legal arguments.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (a)(2)(B) clarifies the procedure for seeking to expedite an appeal. A motion under this provision seeks to expedite the time for the disposition of the appeal as a whole, whereas an emergency motion—which is addressed by subdivision (d)—typically involves an urgent request for relief short of disposing of the entire appeal (for example, an emergency request for a stay pending appeal to prevent imminent mootness). In appropriate cases—such as when there is an urgent need to resolve the appeal quickly to prevent harm—a party may file a motion to expedite the appeal as an emergency motion.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (b) retains the substance of former Rule 8011(b). It authorizes the district court or BAP to act on a motion for a procedural order without awaiting a response to the motion. It specifies that a party seeking reconsideration, vacation, or modification of the order must file a motion within 7 days after service of the order.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (c) continues the practice of former Rule 8011(c) and F.R.App.P. 27(e) of dispensing with oral argument of motions in the district court or BAP unless the court orders otherwise.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (d), which carries forward the content of former Rule 8011(d), governs emergency motions that the district court or BAP may rule on without awaiting a response when necessary to prevent irreparable harm. A party seeking expedited action on a motion in the district court or BAP must explain the nature of the emergency, whether all grounds in support of the motion were first presented to the bankruptcy court, and, if not, why the district court or BAP should not remand for reconsideration. The moving party must also explain the steps taken to notify opposing counsel and any unrepresented parties in advance of filing the emergency motion and, if they were not notified, why it was impracticable to do so.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (e), like former Rule 8011(e) and similar to F.R.App.P. 27(c), authorizes a single BAP judge to rule on certain motions. This authority, however, does not extend to issuing rulings that would dispose of the appeal. For that reason, the rule now prohibits a single BAP judge from denying a motion for a stay pending appeal when the effect of that ruling would be to require dismissal of the appeal as moot. A ruling by a single judge is subject to review by the BAP.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (f) incorporates by reference the formatting and appearance requirements of F.R.App.P. 27(d)(1). When paper versions of the listed documents are filed, they must comply with the requirements of the specified rules regarding reproduction, covers, binding, appearance, and format. When these documents are filed electronically, they must comply with the relevant requirements of the specified rules regarding covers and format. Subdivision (f) also specifies page limits for motions, responses, and replies, which is a matter that former Rule 8011 did not address.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (g) clarifies the procedure for seeking to intervene in a proceeding that has been appealed. It is based on F.R.App.P. 15(d), but it also requires the moving party to explain why intervention is being sought at the appellate stage. The former Part VIII rules did not address intervention.
<br>
<br>Changes Made After Publication and Comment. Subdivision (a)(2)(D) was changed to allow the court to require a notice of motion or proposed order. A stylistic change was made to subdivision (d)(2)(B).
<br>Committee Notes on Rules—2018 Amendment
<br>
<br>Subdivision (f)(3) is amended to conform to F.R.App.P. 27(d)(2), which was recently amended to replace page limits with word limits for motions and responses produced using a computer. The word limits were derived from the current page limits, using the assumption that one page is equivalent to 260 words. Documents produced using a computer must include the certificate of compliance required by Rule 8015(h); Official Form 417C suffices to meet that requirement. Page limits are retained for papers prepared without the aid of a computer (i.e., handwritten or typewritten papers). For both the word limit and the page limit, the calculation excludes the accompanying documents required by Rule 8013(a)(2)(C) and any items listed in Rule 8015(h).
<br>Committee Notes on Rules—2020 Amendment
<br>
<br>Subdivision (a)(1) is amended to delete the reference to proof of service. This change reflects the recent amendment to Rule 8011(d) that eliminated the requirement of proof of service when filing and service are completed using a court's electronic-filing system.

<br>Prior Rule
<br>
<br>A prior Rule 8014, Apr. 25, 1983, eff. Aug. 1, 1983, as amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987, related to costs, prior to revision of Part VIII, Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.
<br>Committee Notes on Rules—2014
<br>
<br>This rule is derived from former Rule 8010(a) and (b) and F.R.App.P. 28. Adopting much of the content of Rule 28, it provides greater detail than former Rule 8010 contained regarding appellate briefs.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (a) prescribes the content and structure of the appellant's brief. It largely follows former Rule 8010(a)(1), but, to ensure national uniformity, it eliminates the provision authorizing a district court or BAP to alter these requirements. Subdivision (a)(1) provides that when Rule 8012 requires an appellant to file a corporate disclosure statement, it must be placed at the beginning of the appellant's brief. Subdivision (a)(10) is new. It implements the requirement under Rule 8015(a)(7)(C) and (b) for the filing of a certificate of compliance with the limit on the number of words or lines allowed to be in a brief.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (b) carries forward the provisions of former Rule 8010(a)(2).
<br>
<br>Subdivision (c) is derived from F.R.App.P. 28(c). It authorizes an appellant to file a reply brief, which will generally complete the briefing process.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (d) is similar to former Rule 8010(b), but it is reworded to reflect the likelihood that briefs will generally be filed electronically rather than in paper form.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (e) mirrors F.R.App.P. 28(i). It authorizes multiple appellants or appellees to join in a single brief. It also allows a party to incorporate by reference portions of another party's brief.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (f) adopts the procedures of F.R.App.P. 28(j) with respect to the filing of supplemental authorities with the district court or BAP after a brief has been filed or after oral argument. Unlike the appellate rule, it specifies a period of 7 days for filing a response to a submission of supplemental authorities. The supplemental submission and response must comply with the signature requirements of Rule 8011(e).
<br>
<br>Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes were made after publication and comment.
<br>Rule 8015. Form and Length of Briefs; Form of Appendices and Other Papers
<br>
<br>(a) Paper Copies of a Brief. If a paper copy of a brief may or must be filed, the following provisions apply:
<br>

<br>
<br>(Added Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014; amended Apr. 26, 2018, eff. Dec. 1, 2018; Apr. 27, 2020, eff. Dec. 1, 2020.)
<br>Prior Rule
<br>
<br>A prior Rule 8015, Apr. 25, 1983, eff. Aug. 1, 1983, as amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Mar. 26, 2009, eff. Dec. 1, 2009, related to motion for rehearing, prior to revision of Part VIII, Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.
<br>Committee Notes on Rules—2014
<br>
<br>This rule is derived primarily from F.R.App.P. 32. Former Rule 8010(c) prescribed page limits for principal briefs and reply briefs. Those limits are now addressed by subdivision (a)(7) of this rule. In addition, the rule incorporates most of the detail of F.R.App.P. 32 regarding the appearance and format of briefs, appendices, and other documents, along with new provisions that apply when those documents are filed electronically.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (a) prescribes the form requirements for briefs that are filed in paper form. It incorporates F.R.App.P. 32(a), except it does not include color requirements for brief covers, it requires the cover of a brief to include counsel's e-mail address, and cross-references to the appropriate bankruptcy rules are substituted for references to the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (a)(7) decreases the length of briefs, as measured by the number of pages, that was permitted by former Rule 8010(c). Page limits are reduced from 50 to 30 pages for a principal brief and from 25 to 15 for a reply brief in order to achieve consistency with F.R.App.P. 32(a)(7). But as permitted by the appellate rule, subdivision (a)(7) also permits the limits on the length of a brief to be measured by a word or line count, as an alternative to a page limit. Basing the calculation of brief length on either of the type-volume methods specified in subdivision (a)(7)(B) will result in briefs that may exceed the designated page limits in (a)(7)(A) and that may be approximately as long as allowed by the prior page limits.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (b) adapts for briefs that are electronically filed subdivision (a)'s form requirements. With the use of electronic filing, the method of reproduction, method of binding, and use of paper become irrelevant. But information required on the cover, formatting requirements, and limits on brief length remain the same.
<br>
<br>Subdivisions (c) and (d) prescribe the form requirements for appendices. Subdivision (c), applicable to paper appendices, is derived from F.R.App.P. 32(b), and subdivision (d) adapts those requirements for electronically filed appendices.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (e), which is based on F.R.App.P. 32(c), addresses the form required for documents—in paper form or electronically filed—that these rules do not otherwise cover.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (f), like F.R.App.P. 32(e), provides assurance to lawyers and parties that compliance with this rule's form requirements will allow a brief or other document to be accepted by any district court or BAP. A court may, however, by local rule or, under Rule 8028 by order in a particular case, choose to accept briefs and documents that do not comply with all of this rule's requirements. The decision whether to accept a brief that appears not to be in compliance with the rules must be made by the court. Under Rule 8011(a)(3), the clerk may not refuse to accept a document for filing solely because it is not presented in proper form as required by these rules or any local rule or practice.
<br>
<br>Under Rule 8011(e), the party filing the document or, if represented, its counsel must sign all briefs and other submissions. If the document is filed electronically, an electronic signature must be provided in accordance with Rule 8011(e).
<br>
<br>Changes Made After Publication and Comment. In subdivision (f), "or order in a particular case" was deleted as unnecessary. The discussion in the Committee Note about brief lengths was revised, and the discussion of subdivision (f) was expanded.
<br>Committee Notes on Rules—2018 Amendment
<br>
<br>The rule is amended to conform to recent amendments to F.R.App.P. 32, which reduced the word limits generally allowed for briefs. When Rule 32(a)(7)(B)'s type-volume limits for briefs were adopted in 1998, the word limits were based on an estimate of 280 words per page. Amended F.R.App.P. 32 applies a conversion ratio of 260 words per page and reduces the word limits accordingly. Rule 8015(a)(7) adopts the same reduced word limits for briefs prepared by computer.
<br>
<br>In a complex case, a party may need to file a brief that exceeds the type-volume limitations specified in these rules, such as to include unusually voluminous information explaining relevant background or legal provisions or to respond to multiple briefs by opposing parties or amici. The Committee expects that courts will accommodate those situations by granting leave to exceed the type-volume limitations as appropriate.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (f) is amended to make clear a court's ability (by local rule or order in a case) to increase the length limits for briefs and other documents. Subdivision (f) already established this authority as to the length limits in Rule 8015(a)(7); the amendment makes clear that this authority extends to all length limits in Part VIII of the Bankruptcy Rules.
<br>
<br>A new subdivision (g) is added to set out a global list of items excluded from length computations, and the list of exclusions in former subdivision (a)(7)(B)(iii) is deleted. The certificate-of-compliance provision formerly in subdivision (a)(7)(C) is relocated to a new subdivision (h) and now applies to filings under all type-volume limits (other than Rule 8014(f)'s word limit)—including the new word limits in Rules 8013, 8016, 8017, and 8022. Conforming amendments are made to Official Form 417C.
<br>Committee Notes on Rules—2020 Amendment
<br>
<br>The amendment to subdivision (g) is made to reflect recent amendments to Rule 8011(d) that eliminated the requirement of proof of service when filing and service are completed using a court's electronic-filing system. Because each item listed in Rule 8015(g) will not always be required, the initial article is deleted. The word "corporate" is deleted before "disclosure statement" to reflect a concurrent change in the title of Rule 8012.
<br>Rule 8016. Cross-Appeals
<br>
<br>(a) Applicability. This rule applies to a case in which a cross-appeal is filed. Rules 8014(a)–(c), 8015(a)(7)(A)–(B), and 8018(a)(1)–(3) do not apply to such a case, except as otherwise provided in this rule.
<br>
<br>(b) Designation of Appellant. The party who files a notice of appeal first is the appellant for purposes of this rule and Rule 8018(a)(4) and (b) and Rule 8019. If notices are filed on the same day, the plaintiff, petitioner, applicant, or movant in the proceeding below is the appellant. These designations may be modified by the parties' agreement or by court order.
<br>
<br>(c) Briefs. In a case involving a cross-appeal:
<br>
<br>(1) Appellant's Principal Brief. The appellant must file a principal brief in the appeal. That brief must comply with Rule 8014(a).
<br>
<br>(2) Appellee's Principal and Response Brief. The appellee must file a principal brief in the cross-appeal and must, in the same brief, respond to the principal brief in the appeal. That brief must comply with Rule 8014(a), except that the brief need not include a statement of the case unless the appellee is dissatisfied with the appellant's statement.
<br>
<br>(3) Appellant's Response and Reply Brief. The appellant must file a brief that responds to the principal brief in the cross-appeal and may, in the same brief, reply to the response in the appeal. That brief must comply with Rule 8014(a)(2)–(8) and (10), except that none of the following need appear unless the appellant is dissatisfied with the appellee's statement in the cross-appeal:
<br>
<br>(A) the jurisdictional statement;
<br>
<br>(B) the statement of the issues and the applicable standard of appellate review; and
<br>
<br>(C) the statement of the case.
<br>
<br>(4) Appellee's Reply Brief. The appellee may file a brief in reply to the response in the cross-appeal. That brief must comply with Rule 8014(a)(2)–(3) and (10) and must be limited to the issues presented by the cross-appeal.
<br>
<br>(d) Length.
<br>
<br>(1) Page Limitation. Unless it complies with paragraph (2), the appellant's principal brief must not exceed 30 pages; the appellee's principal and response brief, 35 pages; the appellant's response and reply brief, 30 pages; and the appellee's reply brief, 15 pages.
<br>
<br>(2) Type-volume Limitation.
<br>
<br>(A) The appellant's principal brief or the appellant's response and reply brief is acceptable if it includes a certificate under Rule 8015(h) and:
<br>
<br>(i) contains no more than 13,000 words; or
<br>
<br>(ii) uses a monospaced face and contains no more than 1,300 lines of text.
<br>
<br>(B) The appellee's principal and response brief is acceptable if it includes a certificate under Rule 8015(h) and:
<br>
<br>(i) contains no more than 15,300 words; or
<br>
<br>(ii) uses a monospaced face and contains no more than 1,500 lines of text.
<br>
<br>(C) The appellee's reply brief is acceptable if it includes a certificate under Rule 8015(h) and contains no more than half of the type volume specified in subparagraph (A).
<br>
<br>(e) Time to Serve and File a Brief. Briefs must be served and filed as follows, unless the district court or BAP by order in a particular case excuses the filing of briefs or specifies different time limits:
<br>
<br>(1) the appellant's principal brief, within 30 days after the docketing of notice that the record has been transmitted or is available electronically;
<br>
<br>(2) the appellee's principal and response brief, within 30 days after the appellant's principal brief is served;
<br>
<br>(3) the appellant's response and reply brief, within 30 days after the appellee's principal and response brief is served; and
<br>
<br>(4) the appellee's reply brief, within 14 days after the appellant's response and reply brief is served, but at least 7 days before scheduled argument unless the district court or BAP, for good cause, allows a later filing.
<br>
<br>(Added Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014; amended Apr. 26, 2018, eff. Dec. 1, 2018.)
<br>Prior Rule
<br>
<br>A prior Rule 8016, Apr. 25, 1983, eff. Aug. 1, 1983, as amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991, related to duties of clerk of district court and bankruptcy appellate panel, prior to revision of Part VIII, Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.
<br>Committee Notes on Rules—2014
<br>
<br>This rule is derived from F.R.App.P. 28.1. It governs the timing, content, length, filing, and service of briefs in bankruptcy appeals in which there is a cross-appeal. The former Part VIII rules did not separately address the topic of cross-appeals.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (b) prescribes which party is designated the appellant when there is a cross-appeal. Generally, the first to file a notice of appeal will be the appellant.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (c) specifies the briefs that the appellant and the appellee may file. Because of the dual role of the parties to the appeal and cross-appeal, each party is permitted to file a principal brief and a response to the opposing party's brief, as well as a reply brief. For the appellee, the principal brief in the cross-appeal and the response in the appeal are combined into a single brief. The appellant, on the other hand, initially files a principal brief in the appeal and later files a response to the appellee's principal brief in the cross-appeal, along with a reply brief in the appeal. The final brief that may be filed is the appellee's reply brief in the cross-appeal.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (d), which prescribes page limits for briefs, is adopted from F.R.App.P. 28.1(e). It applies to briefs that are filed electronically, as well as to those filed in paper form. Like Rule 8015(a)(7), it imposes limits measured by either the number of pages or the number of words or lines of text.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (e) governs the time for filing briefs in cases in which there is a cross-appeal. It adapts the provisions of F.R.App.P. 28.1(f).
<br>
<br>Changes Made After Publication and Comment. Subdivision (d)(2)(D) was added, and subdivision (f) was deleted. In subdivision (a), the statement that Rule 8018(a) does not apply was changed to refer to Rule 8018(a)(1)–(3). In subdivision (b), Rule 8018(a)(4) was added to the list of rules. Conforming changes were made to the Committee Note.
<br>Committee Notes on Rules—2018 Amendment
<br>
<br>The rule is amended to conform to recent amendments to F.R.App.P. 28.1, which reduced the word limits generally allowed for briefs in cross-appeals. When Rule 28.1 was adopted in 2005, it modeled its type-volume limits on those set forth in F.R.App.P. 32(a)(7) for briefs in cases that did not involve a cross-appeal. At that time, Rule 32(a)(7)(B) set word limits based on an estimate of 280 words per page. Amended F.R.App.P. 32 and 28.1 apply a conversion ratio of 260 words per page and reduce the word limits accordingly. Rule 8016(d)(2) adopts the same reduced word limits.
<br>
<br>In a complex case, a party may need to file a brief that exceeds the type-volume limitations specified in these rules, such as to include unusually voluminous information explaining relevant background or legal provisions or to respond to multiple briefs by opposing parties or amici. The Committee expects that courts will accommodate those situations by granting leave to exceed the type-volume limitations as appropriate.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (d) is amended to refer to new Rule 8015(h) (which now contains the certificate-of-compliance provision formerly in Rule 8015(a)(7)(C)).
<br>Rule 8017. Brief of an Amicus Curiae
<br>
<br>(a) During Initial Consideration of a Case on the Merits.
<br>
<br>(1) Applicability. This Rule 8017(a) governs amicus filings during a court's initial consideration of a case on the merits.
<br>
<br>(2) When Permitted. The United States or its officer or agency or a state may file an amicus brief without the consent of the parties or leave of court. Any other amicus curiae may file a brief only by leave of court or if the brief states that all parties have consented to its filing, but a district court or BAP may prohibit the filing of or may strike an amicus brief that would result in a judge's disqualification. On its own motion, and with notice to all parties to an appeal, the district court or BAP may request a brief by an amicus curiae.
<br>
<br>(3) Motion for Leave to File. The motion must be accompanied by the proposed brief and state:
<br>
<br>(A) the movant's interest; and
<br>
<br>(B) the reason why an amicus brief is desirable and why the matters asserted are relevant to the disposition of the appeal.
<br>
<br>(4) Contents and Form. An amicus brief must comply with Rule 8015. In addition to the requirements of Rule 8015, the cover must identify the party or parties supported and indicate whether the brief supports affirmance or reversal. If an amicus curiae is a corporation, the brief must include a disclosure statement like that required of parties by Rule 8012. An amicus brief need not comply with Rule 8014, but must include the following:
<br>
<br>(A) a table of contents, with page references;
<br>
<br>(B) a table of authorities—cases (alphabetically arranged), statutes, and other authorities—with references to the pages of the brief where they are cited;
<br>
<br>(C) a concise statement of the identity of the amicus curiae, its interest in the case, and the source of its authority to file;
<br>
<br>(D) unless the amicus curiae is one listed in the first sentence of subdivision (a)(2), a statement that indicates whether:
<br>
<br>(i) a party's counsel authored the brief in whole or in part;
<br>
<br>(ii) a party or a party's counsel contributed money that was intended to fund preparing or submitting the brief; and
<br>
<br>(iii) a person—other than the amicus curiae, its members, or its counsel— contributed money that was intended to fund preparing or submitting the brief and, if so, identifies each such person;
<br>
<br>(E) an argument, which may be preceded by a summary and need not include a statement of the applicable standard of review; and
<br>
<br>(F) a certificate of compliance, if required by Rule 8015(h).
<br>
<br>(5) Length. Except by the district court's or BAP's permission, an amicus brief must be no more than one-half the maximum length authorized by these rules for a party's principal brief. If the court grants a party permission to file a longer brief, that extension does not affect the length of an amicus brief.
<br>
<br>(6) Time for Filing. An amicus curiae must file its brief, accompanied by a motion for filing when necessary, no later than 7 days after the principal brief of the party being supported is filed. An amicus curiae that does not support either party must file its brief no later than 7 days after the appellant's principal brief is filed. The district court or BAP may grant leave for later filing, specifying the time within which an opposing party may answer.
<br>
<br>(7) Reply Brief. Except by the district court's or BAP's permission, an amicus curiae may not file a reply brief.
<br>
<br>(8) Oral Argument. An amicus curiae may participate in oral argument only with the district court's or BAP's permission.
<br>
<br>(b) During Consideration of Whether to Grant Rehearing.
<br>
<br>(1) Applicability. This Rule 8017(b) governs amicus filings during a district court's or BAP's consideration of whether to grant rehearing, unless a local rule or order in a case provides otherwise.
<br>
<br>(2) When Permitted. The United States or its officer or agency or a state may file an amicus brief without the consent of the parties or leave of court. Any other amicus curiae may file a brief only by leave of court.
<br>
<br>(3) Motion for Leave to File. Rule 8017(a)(3) applies to a motion for leave.
<br>
<br>(4) Contents, Form, and Length. Rule 8017(a)(4) applies to the amicus brief. The brief must include a certificate under Rule 8015(h) and not exceed 2,600 words.
<br>
<br>(5)Time for Filing. An amicus curiae supporting the motion for rehearing or supporting neither party must file its brief, accompanied by a motion for filing when necessary, no later than 7 days after the motion is filed. An amicus curiae opposing the motion for rehearing must file its brief, accompanied by a motion for filing when necessary, no later than the date set by the court for the response.
<br>
<br>(Added Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014; amended Apr. 26, 2018, eff. Dec. 1, 2018.)
<br>Prior Rule
<br>
<br>A prior Rule 8017, Apr. 25, 1983, eff. Aug. 1, 1983, as amended Mar. 26, 2009, eff. Dec. 1, 2009, related to stay of judgment of district court or bankruptcy appellate panel, prior to revision of Part VIII, Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.
<br>Committee Notes on Rules—2014
<br>
<br>This rule is derived from F.R.App.P. 29. The former Part VIII rules did not address the participation by an amicus curiae in a bankruptcy appeal.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (a) adopts the provisions of F.R.App.P. 29(a). In addition, it authorizes the district court or BAP on its own motion—with notice to the parties—to request the filing of a brief by an amicus curiae.
<br>
<br>Subdivisions (b)–(g) adopt F.R.App.P. 29(b)–(g).
<br>
<br>Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes were made after publication and comment.
<br>Committee Notes on Rules—2018 Amendment
<br>
<br>Rule 8017 is amended to conform to the recent amendment to F.R.App.P. 29, which now addresses amicus filings in connection with petitions for rehearing. Former Rule 8017 is renumbered Rule 8017(a), and language is added to that subdivision (a) to state that its provisions apply to amicus filings during the district court's or BAP's initial consideration of a case on the merits. New subdivision (b) is added to address amicus filings in connection with a motion for rehearing. Subdivision (b) sets default rules that apply when a district court or BAP does not provide otherwise by local rule or by order in a case. A court remains free to adopt different rules governing whether amicus filings are permitted in connection with motions for rehearing and the procedures when such filings are permitted.
<br>
<br>The amendment to subdivision (a)(2) authorizes orders or local rules that prohibit the filing of or permit the striking of an amicus brief by party consent if the brief would result in a judge's disqualification. The amendment does not alter or address the standards for when an amicus brief requires a judge's disqualification. It is modeled on an amendment to F.R.App.P. 29(a). A comparable amendment to subdivision (b) is not necessary. Subdivision (b)(1) authorizes local rules and orders governing filings during a court's consideration of whether to grant rehearing. These local rules or orders may prohibit the filing of or permit the striking of an amicus brief that would result in a judge's disqualification. In addition, under subdivision (b)(2), a court may deny leave to file an amicus brief that would result in a judge's disqualification.
<br>Rule 8018. Serving and Filing Briefs; Appendices
<br>
<br>(a) Time to Serve and File a Brief. The following rules apply unless the district court or BAP by order in a particular case excuses the filing of briefs or specifies different time limits:
<br>
<br>(1) The appellant must serve and file a brief within 30 days after the docketing of notice that the record has been transmitted or is available electronically.
<br>
<br>(2) The appellee must serve and file a brief within 30 days after service of the appellant's brief.
<br>
<br>(3) The appellant may serve and file a reply brief within 14 days after service of the appellee's brief, but a reply brief must be filed at least 7 days before scheduled argument unless the district court or BAP, for good cause, allows a later filing.
<br>
<br>(4) If an appellant fails to file a brief on time or within an extended time authorized by the district court or BAP, an appellee may move to dismiss the appeal—or the district court or BAP, after notice, may dismiss the appeal on its own motion. An appellee who fails to file a brief will not be heard at oral argument unless the district court or BAP grants permission.
<br>
<br>(b) Duty to Serve and File an Appendix to the Brief.
<br>
<br>(1) Appellant. Subject to subdivision (e) and Rule 8009(d), the appellant must serve and file with its principal brief excerpts of the record as an appendix. It must contain the following:
<br>
<br>(A) the relevant entries in the bankruptcy docket;
<br>
<br>(B) the complaint and answer, or other equivalent filings;
<br>
<br>(C) the judgment, order, or decree from which the appeal is taken;
<br>
<br>(D) any other orders, pleadings, jury instructions, findings, conclusions, or opinions relevant to the appeal;
<br>
<br>(E) the notice of appeal; and
<br>
<br>(F) any relevant transcript or portion of it.
<br>
<br>(2) Appellee. The appellee may also serve and file with its brief an appendix that contains material required to be included by the appellant or relevant to the appeal or cross-appeal, but omitted by the appellant.
<br>
<br>(3) Cross-Appellee. The appellant as cross-appellee may also serve and file with its response an appendix that contains material relevant to matters raised initially by the principal brief in the cross-appeal, but omitted by the cross-appellant.
<br>
<br>(c) Format of the Appendix. The appendix must begin with a table of contents identifying the page at which each part begins. The relevant docket entries must follow the table of contents. Other parts of the record must follow chronologically. When pages from the transcript of proceedings are placed in the appendix, the transcript page numbers must be shown in brackets immediately before the included pages. Omissions in the text of documents or of the transcript must be indicated by asterisks. Immaterial formal matters (captions, subscriptions, acknowledgments, and the like) should be omitted.
<br>
<br>(d) Exhibits. Exhibits designated for inclusion in the appendix may be reproduced in a separate volume or volumes, suitably indexed.
<br>
<br>(e) Appeal on the Original Record Without an Appendix. The district court or BAP may, either by rule for all cases or classes of cases or by order in a particular case, dispense with the appendix and permit an appeal to proceed on the original record, with the submission of any relevant parts of the record that the district court or BAP orders the parties to file.

<br>Prior Rule
<br>
<br>A prior Rule 8018, Apr. 25, 1983, eff. Aug. 1, 1983, as amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 27, 1995, eff. Dec. 1, 1995, related to rules by circuit councils and district courts and procedure when there is no controlling law, prior to revision of Part VIII, Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.
<br>Committee Notes on Rules—2014
<br>
<br>This rule is derived from former Rule 8009 and F.R.App.P. 30 and 31. Like former Rule 8009, it addresses the timing of serving and filing briefs and appendices, as well as the content and format of appendices. Rule 8011 governs the methods of filing and serving briefs and appendices.
<br>
<br>The rule retains the bankruptcy practice of permitting the appellee to file its own appendix, rather than requiring the appellant to include in its appendix matters designated by the appellee. Rule 8016 governs the timing of serving and filing briefs when a cross-appeal is taken. This rule's provisions about appendices apply to all appeals, including cross-appeals.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (a) retains former Rule 8009's provision that allows the district court or BAP to dispense with briefing or to provide different time periods than this rule specifies. It increases some of the time periods for filing briefs from the periods prescribed by the former rule, while still retaining shorter time periods than some provided by F.R.App.P. 31(a). The time for filing the appellant's brief is increased from 14 to 30 days after the docketing of the notice of the transmission of the record or notice of the availability of the record. That triggering event is equivalent to docketing the appeal under former Rule 8007. Appellate Rule 31(a)(1), by contrast, provides the appellant 40 days after the record is filed to file its brief. The shorter time period for bankruptcy appeals reflects the frequent need for greater expedition in the resolution of bankruptcy appeals, while still providing the appellant more time to prepare its brief than the former rule provided.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (a)(2) similarly expands the time period for filing the appellee's brief from 14 to 30 days after the service of the appellant's brief. This period is the same as F.R.App.P. 31(a)(1) provides.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (a)(3) retains the 14-day time period for filing a reply brief that the former rule prescribed, but it qualifies that period to ensure that the final brief is filed at least 7 days before oral argument.
<br>
<br>If a district court or BAP has a mediation procedure for bankruptcy appeals, that procedure could affect when briefs must be filed. See Rule 8027.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (a)(4) is new. Based on F.R.App.P. 31(c), it provides for actions that may be taken—dismissal of the appeal or denial of participation in oral argument—if the appellant or appellee fails to file its brief.
<br>
<br>Subdivisions (b) and (c) govern the content and format of the appendix to a brief. Subdivision (b) is similar to former Rule 8009(b), and subdivision (c) is derived from F.R.App.P. 30(d).
<br>
<br>Subdivision (d), which addresses the inclusion of exhibits in the appendix, is derived from F.R.App.P. 30(e).
<br>
<br>Changes Made After Publication and Comment. Subdivision (a)(4) was revised to provide more detail about the procedure for dismissing an appeal due to appellant's failure to timely file a brief.
<br>Rule 8018.1. District-Court Review of a Judgment that the Bankruptcy Court Lacked the Constitutional Authority to Enter
<br>
<br>If, on appeal, a district court determines that the bankruptcy court did not have the power under Article III of the Constitution to enter the judgment, order, or decree appealed from, the district court may treat it as proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.
<br>
<br>(Added Apr. 26, 2018, eff. Dec. 1, 2018.)
<br>Committee Notes on Rules—2018
<br>
<br>This rule is new. It is added to prevent a district court from having to remand an appeal whenever it determines that the bankruptcy court lacked constitutional authority to enter the judgment, order, or decree appealed from. Consistent with the Supreme Court's decision in Executive Benefits Ins. Agency v. Arkison, 134 S. Ct. 2165 (2014), the district court in that situation may treat the bankruptcy court's judgment as proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. Upon making the determination to proceed in that manner, the district court may choose to allow the parties to file written objections to specific proposed findings and conclusions and to respond to another party's objections, see Rule 9033; treat the parties' briefs as objections and responses; or prescribe other procedures for the review of the proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.
<br>Rule 8019. Oral Argument
<br>
<br>(a) Party's Statement. Any party may file, or a district court or BAP may require, a statement explaining why oral argument should, or need not, be permitted.
<br>
<br>(b) Presumption of Oral Argument and Exceptions. Oral argument must be allowed in every case unless the district judge—or all the BAP judges assigned to hear the appeal—examine the briefs and record and determine that oral argument is unnecessary because
<br>
<br>(1) the appeal is frivolous;
<br>
<br>(2) the dispositive issue or issues have been authoritatively decided; or
<br>
<br>(3) the facts and legal arguments are adequately presented in the briefs and record, and the decisional process would not be significantly aided by oral argument.
<br>
<br>(c) Notice of Argument; Postponement. The district court or BAP must advise all parties of the date, time, and place for oral argument, and the time allowed for each side. A motion to postpone the argument or to allow longer argument must be filed reasonably in advance of the hearing date.
<br>
<br>(d) Order and Contents of Argument. The appellant opens and concludes the argument. Counsel must not read at length from briefs, the record, or authorities.
<br>
<br>(e) Cross-Appeals and Separate Appeals. If there is a cross-appeal, Rule 8016(b) determines which party is the appellant and which is the appellee for the purposes of oral argument. Unless the district court or BAP directs otherwise, a cross-appeal or separate appeal must be argued when the initial appeal is argued. Separate parties should avoid duplicative argument.
<br>
<br>(f) Nonappearance of a Party. If the appellee fails to appear for argument, the district court or BAP may hear the appellant's argument. If the appellant fails to appear for argument, the district court or BAP may hear the appellee's argument. If neither party appears, the case will be decided on the briefs unless the district court or BAP orders otherwise.
<br>
<br>(g) Submission on Briefs. The parties may agree to submit a case for decision on the briefs, but the district court or BAP may direct that the case be argued.
<br>
<br>(h) Use of Physical Exhibits at Argument; Removal. Counsel intending to use physical exhibits other than documents at the argument must arrange to place them in the courtroom on the day of the argument before the court convenes. After the argument, counsel must remove the exhibits from the courtroom unless the district court or BAP directs otherwise. The clerk may destroy or dispose of the exhibits if counsel does not reclaim them within a reasonable time after the clerk gives notice to remove them.

<br>Prior Rule
<br>
<br>A prior Rule 8019, Apr. 25, 1983, eff. Aug. 1, 1983, as amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987, related to suspension of rules in Part VIII, prior to revision of Part VIII, Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.
<br>Committee Notes on Rules—2014
<br>
<br>This rule generally retains the provisions of former Rule 8012 and adds much of the additional detail of F.R.App.P. 34. By incorporating the more detailed provisions of the appellate rule, Rule 8019 promotes national uniformity regarding oral argument in bankruptcy appeals.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (a), like F.R.App.P. 34(a)(1), now allows a party to submit a statement explaining why oral argument is or is not needed. It also authorizes a court to require this statement. Former Rule 8012 only authorized statements explaining why oral argument should be allowed.
<br>
<br>Subdivision (b) retains the reasons set forth in former Rule 8012 for the district court or BAP to conclude that oral argument is not needed.
<br>
<br>The remainder of this rule adopts the provisions of F.R.App.P. 34(b)–(g), with one exception. Rather than requiring the district court or BAP to hear appellant's argument if the appellee does not appear, subdivision (f) authorizes the district court or BAP to go forward with the argument in the appellee's absence. Should the court decide, however, to postpone the oral argument in that situation, it would be authorized to do so.
<br>
<br>Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes were made after publication and comment.
<br>Rule 8020. Frivolous Appeal and Other Misconduct
<br>
<br>(a) Frivolous Appeal—Damages and Costs. If the district court or BAP determines that an appeal is frivolous, it may, after a separately filed motion or notice from the court and reasonable opportunity to respond, award just damages and single or double costs to the appellee.
<br>
<br>(b) Other Misconduct. The district court or BAP may discipline or sanction an attorney or party appearing before it for other misconduct, including failure to comply with any court order. First, however, the court must afford the attorney or party reasonable notice, an opportunity to show cause to the contrary, and, if requested, a hearing.

<br>Committee Notes on Rules—2014
<br>
<br>This rule is derived from former Rule 8020 and F.R.App.P. 38 and 46(c). Subdivision (a) permits an award of damages and costs to an appellee for a frivolous appeal. Subdivision (b) permits the district court or BAP to impose on parties as well as their counsel sanctions for misconduct other than taking a frivolous appeal. Failure to comply with a court order, for which sanctions may be imposed, may include a failure to comply with a local court rule.
<br>
<br>Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes were made after publication and comment.
<br>Rule 8021. Costs
<br>
<br>(a) Against Whom Assessed. The following rules apply unless the law provides or the district court or BAP orders otherwise:
<br>
<br>(1) if an appeal is dismissed, costs are taxed against the appellant, unless the parties agree otherwise;
<br>
<br>(2) if a judgment, order, or decree is affirmed, costs are taxed against the appellant;
<br>
<br>(3) if a judgment, order, or decree is reversed, costs are taxed against the appellee;
<br>
<br>(4) if a judgment, order, or decree is affirmed or reversed in part, modified, or vacated, costs are taxed only as the district court or BAP orders.
<br>
<br>(b) Costs For and Against the United States. Costs for or against the United States, its agency, or its officer may be assessed under subdivision (a) only if authorized by law.
<br>
<br>(c) Costs on Appeal Taxable in the Bankruptcy Court. The following costs on appeal are taxable in the bankruptcy court for the benefit of the party entitled to costs under this rule:
<br>
<br>(1) the production of any required copies of a brief, appendix, exhibit, or the record;
<br>
<br>(2) the preparation and transmission of the record;
<br>
<br>(3) the reporter's transcript, if needed to determine the appeal;
<br>
<br>(4) premiums paid for a bond or other security to preserve rights pending appeal; and
<br>
<br>(5) the fee for filing the notice of appeal.
<br>
<br>(d) Bill of Costs; Objections. A party who wants costs taxed must, within 14 days after entry of judgment on appeal, file with the bankruptcy clerk and serve an itemized and verified bill of costs. Objections must be filed within 14 days after service of the bill of costs, unless the bankruptcy court extends the time.
<br>
<br>(Added Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014; amended Apr. 26, 2018, eff. Dec. 1, 2018; Apr. 27, 2020, eff. Dec. 1, 2020.)
<br>Committee Notes on Rules—2014
<br>
<br>This rule is derived from former Rule 8014 and F.R.App.P. 39. It retains the former rule's authorization for taxing appellate costs against the losing party and its specification of the costs that may be taxed. The rule also incorporates some of the additional details regarding the taxing of costs contained in F.R.App.P. 39. Consistent with former Rule 8014, the bankruptcy clerk has the responsibility for taxing all costs. Subdivision (b), derived from F.R.App.P. 39(b), clarifies that additional authority is required for the taxation of costs by or against federal governmental parties.
<br>
<br>Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes were made after publication and comment.
<br>Committee Notes on Rules—2018 Amendment
<br>
<br>The amendment of subdivision (c) conforms this rule with the amendment of F.R.Civ.P. 62, which is made applicable in adversary proceedings by Rule 7062. Rule 62 formerly required a party to provide a "supersedeas bond" to obtain a stay of the judgment and proceedings to enforce the judgment. As amended, Rule 62(b) allows a party to obtain a stay by providing a "bond or other security."
<br>Committee Notes on Rules—2020 Amendment
<br>
<br>Subdivision (d) is amended to delete the reference to proof of service. This change reflects the recent amendment to Rule 8011(d) that eliminated the requirement of proof of service when filing and service are completed using a court's electronic-filing system.
<br>Rule 8022. Motion for Rehearing
<br>
<br>(a) Time to File; Contents; Response; Action by the District Court or BAP if Granted.
<br>
<br>(1) Time. Unless the time is shortened or extended by order or local rule, any motion for rehearing by the district court or BAP must be filed within 14 days after entry of judgment on appeal.
<br>
<br>(2) Contents. The motion must state with particularity each point of law or fact that the movant believes the district court or BAP has overlooked or misapprehended and must argue in support of the motion. Oral argument is not permitted.
<br>
<br>(3) Response. Unless the district court or BAP requests, no response to a motion for rehearing is permitted. But ordinarily, rehearing will not be granted in the absence of such a request.
<br>
<br>(4) Action by the District Court or BAP. If a motion for rehearing is granted, the district court or BAP may do any of the following:
<br>
<br>(A) make a final disposition of the appeal without reargument;
<br>
<br>(B) restore the case to the calendar for reargument or resubmission; or
<br>
<br>(C) issue any other appropriate order.
<br>
<br>(b) Form of the Motion; Length. The motion must comply in form with Rule 8013(f)(1) and (2). Copies must be served and filed as provided by Rule 8011. Except by the district court's or BAP's permission:
<br>
<br>(1) a motion for rehearing produced using a computer must include a certificate under Rule 8015(h) and not exceed 3,900 words; and
<br>
<br>(2) a handwritten or typewritten motion must not exceed 15 pages.
<br>

<br>Committee Notes on Rules—2014
<br>
<br>This rule is derived from former Rule 8015 and F.R.App.P. 40. It deletes the provision of former Rule 8015 regarding the time for appeal to the court of appeals because the matter is addressed by F.R.App.P. 6(b)(2)(A).
<br>
<br>Changes Made After Publication and Comment. In subdivision (b), the reference to local rule was deleted as unnecessary.
<br>Committee Notes on Rules—2018 Amendment
<br>
<br>Subdivision (b) is amended to conform to the recent amendment to F.R.App.P. 40(b), which was one of several appellate rules in which word limits were substituted for page limits for documents prepared by computer. The word limits were derived from the previous page limits using the assumption that one page is equivalent to 260 words. Documents produced using a computer must include the certificate of compliance required by Rule 8015(h); completion of Official Form 417C suffices to meet that requirement.
<br>
<br>Page limits are retained for papers prepared without the aid of a computer (i.e., handwritten or typewritten papers). For both the word limit and the page limit, the calculation excludes any items listed in Rule 8015(g).
<br>Rule 8023. Voluntary Dismissal
<br>
<br>The clerk of the district court or BAP must dismiss an appeal if the parties file a signed dismissal agreement specifying how costs are to be paid and pay any fees that are due. An appeal may be dismissed on the appellant's motion on terms agreed to by the parties or fixed by the district court or BAP.
<br>
<br>(Added Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.)
<br>Committee Notes on Rules—2014
<br>
<br>This rule is derived from former Rule 8001(c) and F.R.App.P. 42. The provision of the former rule regarding dismissal of appeals in the bankruptcy court prior to docketing of the appeal has been deleted. Now that docketing occurs promptly after a notice of appeal is filed, see Rules 8003(d) and 8004(c), an appeal likely will not be voluntarily dismissed before docketing.
<br>
<br>The rule retains the provision of the former rule that the district or BAP clerk must dismiss an appeal upon the parties' agreement. District courts and BAPs continue to have discretion to dismiss an appeal on an appellant's motion. Nothing in the rule prohibits a district court or BAP from dismissing an appeal for other reasons authorized by law, such as the failure to prosecute an appeal.
<br>
<br>Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes were made after publication and comment.
<br>Rule 8024. Clerk's Duties on Disposition of the Appeal
<br>
<br>(a) Judgment on Appeal. The district or BAP clerk must prepare, sign, and enter the judgment after receiving the court's opinion or, if there is no opinion, as the court instructs. Noting the judgment on the docket constitutes entry of judgment.
<br>
<br>(b) Notice of a Judgment. Immediately upon the entry of a judgment, the district or BAP clerk must:
<br>
<br>(1) transmit a notice of the entry to each party to the appeal, to the United States trustee, and to the bankruptcy clerk, together with a copy of any opinion; and
<br>
<br>(2) note the date of the transmission on the docket.
<br>
<br>(c) Returning Physical Items. If any physical items were transmitted as the record on appeal, they must be returned to the bankruptcy clerk on disposition of the appeal.
<br>
<br>(Added Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.)
<br>Committee Notes on Rules—2014
<br>
<br>This rule is derived from former Rule 8016, which was adapted from F.R.App.P. 36 and 45(c) and (d). The rule is reworded to reflect that only items in the record that are physically, as opposed to electronically, transmitted to the district court or BAP need to be returned to the bankruptcy clerk. Other changes to the former rule are stylistic.
<br>
<br>Changes Made After Publication and Comment. Stylistic changes were made to subdivision (c) and the Committee Note.
<br>Rule 8025. Stay of a District Court or BAP Judgment
<br>
<br>(a) Automatic Stay of Judgment on Appeal. Unless the district court or BAP orders otherwise, its judgment is stayed for 14 days after entry.
<br>
<br>(b) Stay Pending Appeal to the Court of Appeals.
<br>
<br>(1) In General. On a party's motion and notice to all other parties to the appeal, the district court or BAP may stay its judgment pending an appeal to the court of appeals.
<br>
<br>(2) Time Limit. The stay must not exceed 30 days after the judgment is entered, except for cause shown.
<br>
<br>(3) Stay Continued. If, before a stay expires, the party who obtained the stay appeals to the court of appeals, the stay continues until final disposition by the court of appeals.
<br>
<br>(4) Bond or Other Security. A bond or other security may be required as a condition for granting or continuing a stay of the judgment. A bond or other security may be required if a trustee obtains a stay, but not if a stay is obtained by the United States or its officer or agency or at the direction of any department of the United States government.
<br>
<br>(c) Automatic Stay of an Order, Judgment, or Decree of a Bankruptcy Court. If the district court or BAP enters a judgment affirming an order, judgment, or decree of the bankruptcy court, a stay of the district court's or BAP's judgment automatically stays the bankruptcy court's order, judgment, or decree for the duration of the appellate stay.
<br>
<br>(d) Power of a Court of Appeals Not Limited. This rule does not limit the power of a court of appeals or any of its judges to do the following:
<br>
<br>(1) stay a judgment pending appeal;
<br>
<br>(2) stay proceedings while an appeal is pending;
<br>
<br>(3) suspend, modify, restore, vacate, or grant a stay or an injunction while an appeal is pending; or
<br>
<br>(4) issue any order appropriate to preserve the status quo or the effectiveness of any judgment to be entered.
<br>
<br>(Added Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.)
<br>Committee Notes on Rules—2014
<br>
<br>This rule is derived from former Rule 8017. Most of the changes to the former rule are stylistic. Subdivision (c) is new. It provides that if a district court or BAP affirms the bankruptcy court ruling and the appellate judgment is stayed, the bankruptcy court's order, judgment, or decree that is affirmed on appeal is automatically stayed to the same extent as the stay of the appellate judgment.
<br>
<br>Changes Made After Publication and Comment. No changes were made after publication and comment.
<br>Rule 8026. Rules by Circuit Councils and District Courts; Procedure When There is No Controlling Law
<br>
<br>(a) Local Rules by Circuit Councils and District Courts.
<br>
<br>(1) Adopting Local Rules. A circuit council that has authorized a BAP under 28 U.S.C. §158(b) may make and amend rules governing the practice and procedure on appeal from a judgment, order, or decree of a bankruptcy court to the BAP. A district court may make and amend rules governing the practice and procedure on appeal from a judgment, order, or decree of a bankruptcy court to the district court. Local rules must be consistent with, but not duplicative of, Acts of Congress and these Part VIII rules. Rule 83 F.R.Civ.P. governs the procedure for making and amending rules to govern appeals.
<br>
<br>(2) Numbering. Local rules must conform to any uniform numbering system prescribed by the Judicial Conference of the United States.
<br>
<br>(3) Limitation on Imposing Requirements of Form. A local rule imposing a requirement of form must not be enforced in a way that causes a party to lose any right because of a nonwillful failure to comply.
<br>
<br>(b) Procedure When There is No Controlling Law.
<br>
<br>(1) In General. A district court or BAP may regulate practice in any manner consistent with federal law, applicable federal rules, the Official Forms, and local rules.
<br>
<br>(2) Limitation on Sanctions. No sanction or other disadvantage may be imposed for noncompliance with any requirement not in federal law, applicable federal rules, the Official Forms, or local rules unless the alleged violator has been furnished in the particular case with actual notice of the requirement.

<br>
<br>(1) "Bankruptcy clerk" means a clerk appointed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §156(b).
<br>
<br>(2) "Bankruptcy Code" or "Code" means title 11 of the United States Code.
<br>
<br>(3) "Clerk" means bankruptcy clerk, if one has been appointed, otherwise clerk of the district court.
<br>
<br>(4) "Court" or "judge" means the judicial officer before whom a case or proceeding is pending.
<br>
<br>(5) "Debtor." When any act is required by these rules to be performed by a debtor or when it is necessary to compel attendance of a debtor for examination and the debtor is not a natural person: (A) if the debtor is a corporation, "debtor" includes, if designated by the court, any or all of its officers, members of its board of directors or trustees or of a similar controlling body, a controlling stockholder or member, or any other person in control; (B) if the debtor is a partnership, "debtor" includes any or all of its general partners or, if designated by the court, any other person in control.
<br>

<br>
<br>(7) "Judgment" means any appealable order.
<br>

<br>
<br>(As amended Mar. 30, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991; Apr. 25, 2005, eff. Dec. 1, 2005; Apr. 28, 2010, eff. Dec. 1, 2010.)
<br>Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1987 Amendment
<br>
<br>The terms "bankruptcy clerk" and "clerk" have been defined to reflect that unless otherwise stated, for the purpose of these rules, the terms are meant to identify the court officer for the bankruptcy records. If a bankruptcy clerk is appointed, all filings are made with the bankruptcy clerk. If one has not been appointed, all filings are with the clerk of the district court. Rule 5005.
<br>
<br>The rule is also amended to include a definition of "court or judge". Since a case or proceeding may be before a bankruptcy judge or a judge of the district court, "court or judge" is defined to mean the judicial officer before whom the case or proceeding is pending.
<br>Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1991 Amendment
<br>
<br>Section 582 of title 28 provides that the Attorney General may appoint one or more assistant United States trustees in any region when the public interest so requires. This rule is amended to clarify that an assistant United States trustee, as well as any designee of the United States trustee, is included within the meaning of "United States trustee" in the rules.
<br>Committee Notes on Rules—2005 Amendment
<br>
<br>The rule is amended to add the definition of a notice provider and to renumber the final three definitions in the rule. A notice provider is an entity approved by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts to enter into agreements with entities to give notice to those entities in the form and manner agreed to by those parties. The new definition supports the amendment to Rule 2002(g)(4) that authorizes a notice provider to give notices under Rule 2002.
<br>
<br>Many entities conduct business on a national scale and receive vast numbers of notices in bankruptcy cases throughout the country. Those entities can agree with a notice provider to receive their notices in a form and at an address or addresses that the creditor and notice provider agree upon. There are processes currently in use that provide substantial assurance that notices are not misdirected. Any notice provider would have to demonstrate to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts that it could provide the service in a manner that ensures the proper delivery of notice to creditors. Once the Administrative Office of the United States Courts approves the notice provider to enter into agreements with creditors, the notice provider and other entities can establish the relationship that will govern the delivery of notices in cases as provided in Rule 2002(g)(4).
