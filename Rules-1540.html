<br>§1401. Congressional findings and declaration of purpose
<br>(a) Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) the United States' requirements for hard minerals to satisfy national industrial needs will continue to expand and the demand for such minerals will increasingly exceed the available domestic sources of supply;
<br>
<br>(2) in the case of certain hard minerals, the United States is dependent upon foreign sources of supply and the acquisition of such minerals from foreign sources is a significant factor in the national balance-of-payments position;
<br>
<br>(3) the present and future national interest of the United States requires the availability of hard mineral resources which is independent of the export policies of foreign nations;
<br>
<br>(4) there is an alternate source of supply, which is significant in relation to national needs, of certain hard minerals, including nickel, copper, cobalt, and manganese, contained in the nodules existing in great abundance on the deep seabed;
<br>
<br>(5) the nations of the world, including the United States, will benefit if the hard mineral resources of the deep seabed beyond limits of national jurisdiction can be developed and made available for their use;
<br>
<br>(6) in particular, future access to the nickel, copper, cobalt, and manganese resources of the deep seabed will be important to the industrial needs of the nations of the world, both developed and developing;
<br>
<br>(7) on December 17, 1970, the United States supported (by affirmative vote) the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2749 (XXV) declaring inter alia the principle that the mineral resources of the deep seabed are the common heritage of mankind, with the expectation that this principle would be legally defined under the terms of a comprehensive international Law of the Sea Treaty yet to be agreed upon;
<br>
<br>(8) it is in the national interest of the United States and other nations to encourage a widely acceptable Law of the Sea Treaty, which will provide a new legal order for the oceans covering a broad range of ocean interests, including exploration for and commercial recovery of hard mineral resources of the deep seabed;
<br>
<br>(9) the negotiations to conclude such a Treaty and establish the international regime governing the exercise of rights over, and exploration of, the resources of the deep seabed, referred to in General Assembly Resolution 2749 (XXV) are in progress but may not be concluded in the near future;
<br>
<br>(10) even if such negotiations are completed promptly, much time will elapse before such an international regime is established and in operation;
<br>
<br>(11) development of technology required for the exploration and recovery of hard mineral resources of the deep seabed will require substantial investment for many years before commercial production can occur, and must proceed at this time if deep seabed minerals are to be available when needed;
<br>
<br>(12) it is the legal opinion of the United States that exploration for and commercial recovery of hard mineral resources of the deep seabed are freedoms of the high seas subject to a duty of reasonable regard to the interests of other states in their exercise of those and other freedoms recognized by general principles of international law;
<br>
<br>(13) pending a Law of the Sea Treaty, and in the absence of agreement among states on applicable principles of international law, the uncertainty among potential investors as to the future legal regime is likely to discourage or prevent the investments necessary to develop deep seabed mining technology;
<br>
<br>(14) pending a Law of the Sea Treaty, the protection of the marine environment from damage caused by exploration or recovery of hard mineral resources of the deep seabed depends upon the enactment of suitable interim national legislation;
<br>
<br>(15) a Law of the Sea Treaty is likely to establish financial arrangements which obligate the United States or United States citizens to make payments to an international organization with respect to exploration or recovery of the hard mineral resources of the deep seabed; and
<br>
<br>(16) legislation is required to establish an interim legal regime under which technology can be developed and the exploration and recovery of the hard mineral resources of the deep seabed can take place until such time as a Law of the Sea Treaty enters into force with respect to the United States.
<br>(b) Purposes
<br>
<br>The Congress declares that the purposes of this chapter are—
<br>
<br>(1) to encourage the successful conclusion of a comprehensive Law of the Sea Treaty, which will give legal definition to the principle that the hard mineral resources of the deep seabed are the common heritage of mankind and which will assure, among other things, nondiscriminatory access to such resources for all nations;
<br>
<br>(2) pending the ratification by, and entering into force with respect to, the United States of such a Treaty, to provide for the establishment of an international revenue-sharing fund the proceeds of which shall be used for sharing with the international community pursuant to such Treaty;
<br>
<br>(3) to establish, pending the ratification by, and entering into force with respect to, the United States of such a Treaty, an interim program to regulate the exploration for and commercial recovery of hard mineral resources of the deep seabed by United States citizens;
<br>
<br>(4) to accelerate the program of environmental assessment of exploration for and commercial recovery of hard mineral resources of the deep seabed and assure that such exploration and recovery activities are conducted in a manner which will encourage the conservation of such resources, protect the quality of the environment, and promote the safety of life and property at sea; and
<br>
<br>(5) to encourage the continued development of technology necessary to recover the hard mineral resources of the deep seabed.

<br>SUBCHAPTER I—REGULATION OF EXPLORATION AND COMMERCIAL RECOVERY BY UNITED STATES CITIZENS
<br>§1411. Prohibited activities by United States citizens
<br>(a) Prohibited activities and exceptions
<br>
<br>(1) No United States citizen may engage in any exploration or commercial recovery unless authorized to do so under—
<br>
<br>(A) a license or a permit issued under this subchapter;
<br>
<br>(B) a license, permit, or equivalent authorization issued by a reciprocating state; or
<br>
<br>(C) an international agreement which is in force with respect to the United States.
<br>
<br>(2) The prohibitions of this subsection shall not apply to any of the following activities:
<br>
<br>(A) Scientific research, including that concerning hard mineral resources.
<br>
<br>(B) Mapping, or the taking of any geophysical, geochemical, oceanographic, or atmospheric measurements or random bottom samplings of the deep seabed, if such taking does not significantly alter the surface or subsurface of the deep seabed or significantly affect the environment.
<br>
<br>(C) The design, construction, or testing of equipment and facilities which will or may be used for exploration or commercial recovery, if such design, construction, or testing is conducted on shore, or does not involve the recovery of any but incidental hard mineral resources.
<br>
<br>(D) The furnishing of machinery, products, supplies, services, or materials for any exploration or commercial recovery conducted under a license or permit issued under this subchapter, a license or permit or equivalent authorization issued by a reciprocating state, or under an international agreement.
<br>
<br>(E) Activities, other than exploration or commercial recovery activities, of the Federal Government.
<br>(b) Existing exploration
<br>
<br>(1) Subsection (a)(1)(A) shall not be deemed to prohibit any United States citizen who is engaged in exploration before June 28, 1980, from continuing to engage in such exploration—
<br>
<br>(A) if such citizen applies for a license under section 1413(a) of this title with respect to such exploration within such reasonable period of time, after the date on which initial regulations to implement section 1413(a) of this title are issued, as the Administrator shall prescribe; and
<br>
<br>(B) until such license is issued to such citizen or a final administrative or judicial determination is made affirming the denial of certification of the application for, or issuance of, such license.
<br>
<br>(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), if the President by Executive order determines that immediate suspension of exploration activities is necessary for the reasons set forth in section 1416(a)(2)(B) of this title or the Administrator determines that immediate suspension of activities is necessary to prevent a significant adverse effect on the environment or to preserve the safety of life and property at sea, the Administrator is authorized, notwithstanding any other requirement of this chapter, to issue an emergency order requiring any United States citizen who is engaged in exploration before June 28, 1980, to immediately suspend exploration activities. The issuance of such emergency order is subject to judicial review as provided in chapter 7 of title 5.
<br>
<br>(3) The timely filing of any application for a license under paragraph (1)(A) shall entitle the applicant to priority of right for the issuance of such license under section 1413(b) of this title. In any case in which more than one application referred to in paragraph (1) is filed based on exploration plans required by section 1413(a)(2) of this title which refer to all or part of the same deep seabed area, the Administrator shall, in taking action on such applications, apply principles of equity which take into consideration, among other things, the date on which the applicants or predecessors in interest, or component organizations thereof, commenced exploration activities and the continuity and extent of such exploration and amount of funds expended with respect to such exploration.
<br>(c) Interference
<br>
<br>No United States citizen may interfere or participate in interference with any activity conducted by any licensee or permittee which is authorized to be undertaken under a license or permit issued by the United States to the licensee or permittee under this chapter or with any activity conducted by the holder of, and authorized to be undertaken under, a license or permit or equivalent authorization issued by a reciprocating state for the exploration or commercial recovery of hard mineral resources. United States citizens shall exercise their rights on the high seas with reasonable regard for the interests of other states in their exercise of the freedoms of the high seas.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 96–283, title I, §101, June 28, 1980, 94 Stat. 557.)
<br>§1412. Licenses for exploration and permits for commercial recovery
<br>(a) Authority to issue
<br>
<br>Subject to the provisions of this chapter, the Administrator shall issue to applicants who are eligible therefor licenses for exploration and permits for commercial recovery.
<br>(b) Nature of licenses and permits
<br>
<br>(1) A license or permit issued under this subchapter shall authorize the holder thereof to engage in exploration or commercial recovery, as the case may be, consistent with the provisions of this chapter, the regulations issued by the Administrator to implement the provisions of this chapter, and the specific terms, conditions, and restrictions applied to the license or permit by the Administrator.
<br>
<br>(2) Any license or permit issued under this subchapter shall be exclusive with respect to the holder thereof as against any other United States citizen or any citizen, national or governmental agency of, or any legal entity organized or existing under the laws of, any reciprocating state.
<br>
<br>(3) A valid existing license shall entitle the holder, if otherwise eligible under the provisions of this chapter and regulations issued under this chapter, to a permit for commercial recovery. Such a permit recognizes the right of the holder to recover hard mineral resources, and to own, transport, use, and sell hard mineral resources recovered, under the permit and in accordance with the requirements of this chapter.
<br>
<br>(4) In the event of interference with the exploration or commercial recovery activities of a licensee or permittee by nationals of other states, the Secretary of State shall use all peaceful means to resolve the controversy by negotiation, conciliation, arbitration, or resort to agreed tribunals.
<br>(c) Restrictions
<br>
<br>(1) The Administrator may not issue—
<br>
<br>(A) any license or permit after the date on which an international agreement is ratified by and enters into force with respect to the United States, except to the extent that issuance of such license or permit is not inconsistent with such agreement;
<br>
<br>(B) any license or permit the exploration plan or recovery plan of which, submitted pursuant to section 1413(a)(2) of this title, would apply to an area to which applies, or would conflict with, (i) any exploration plan or recovery plan submitted with any pending application to which priority of right for issuance applies under section 1413(b) of this title, (ii) any exploration plan or recovery plan associated with any existing license or permit, or (iii) any equivalent authorization which has been issued, or for which formal notice of application has been submitted, by a reciprocating state prior to the filing date of any relevant application for licenses or permits pursuant to this subchapter;
<br>
<br>(C) a permit authorizing commercial recovery within any area of the deep seabed in which exploration is authorized under a valid existing license if such permit is issued to other than the licensee for such area;
<br>
<br>(D) any exploration license before July 1, 1981, or any permit which authorizes commercial recovery to commence before January 1, 1988;
<br>
<br>(E) any license or permit the exploration plan or recovery plan for which applies to any area of the deep seabed if, within the 3-year period before the date of application for such license or permit, (i) the applicant therefor surrendered or relinquished such area under an exploration plan or recovery plan associated with a previous license or permit issued to such applicant, or (ii) a license or permit previously issued to the applicant had an exploration plan or recovery plan which applied to such area and such license or permit was revoked under section 1416 of this title; or
<br>
<br>(F) a license or permit, or approve the transfer of a license or permit, except to a United States citizen.
<br>
<br>(2) No permittee may use any vessel for the commercial recovery of hard mineral resources or for the processing at sea of hard mineral resources recovered under the permit issued to the permittee unless the vessel is documented under the laws of the United States.
<br>
<br>(3) Each permittee shall use at least one vessel documented under the laws of the United States for the transportation from each mining site of hard mineral resources recovered under the permit issued to the permittee.
<br>
<br>(4) For purposes of the shipping laws of the United States, any vessel documented under the laws of the United States and used in the commercial recovery, processing, or transportation from any mining site of hard mineral resources recovered under a permit issued under this subchapter shall be deemed to be used in, and used in an essential service in, the foreign commerce or foreign trade of the United States, as defined in section 109 of title 46, and shall be deemed to be a vessel as defined in section 53701(13) 1 of title 46.
<br>
<br>(5) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the processing on land of hard mineral resources recovered pursuant to a permit shall be conducted within the United States: Provided, That the President does not determine that such restrictions contravene the overriding national interests of the United States. The Administrator may allow the processing of hard mineral resources at a place other than within the United States if he finds, after opportunity for an agency hearing, that—
<br>
<br>(A) the processing of the quantity concerned of such resource at a place other than within the United States is necessary for the economic viability of the commercial recovery activities of a permittee; and
<br>
<br>(B) satisfactory assurances have been given by the permittee that such resource, after processing, to the extent of the permittee's ownership therein, will be returned to the United States for domestic use, if the Administrator so requires after determining that the national interest necessitates such return.

The area set forth in an exploration plan shall be of sufficient size to allow for intensive exploration.
<br>
<br>(C) The recovery plan for a permit shall set forth the activities proposed to be carried out during the period of the permit, and shall include the intended schedule of commercial recovery, environmental safeguards and monitoring systems, details of the area or areas proposed for commercial recovery, a resource assessment thereof, the methods and technology to be used for commercial recovery and processing, the methods to be used for disposal of wastes from recovery and processing, and such other information as is necessary and appropriate to carry out the provisions of this subchapter.
<br>
<br>(D) The applicant shall select the size and location of the area of the exploration plan or recovery plan, which area shall be approved unless the Administrator finds that—
<br>
<br>(i) the area is not a logical mining unit; or
<br>
<br>(ii) commercial recovery activities in the proposed location would result in a significant adverse impact on the quality of the environment which cannot be avoided by the imposition of reasonable restrictions.
<br>
<br>(E) For purposes of subparagraph (D), "logical mining unit" means—
<br>
<br>(i) in the case of a license for exploration, an area of the deep seabed which can be explored under the license in an efficient, economical, and orderly manner with due regard for conservation and protection of the environment, taking into consideration the resource data, other relevant physical and environmental characteristics, and the state of the technology of the applicant as set forth in the exploration plan; or
<br>
<br>(ii) in the case of a permit, an area of the deep seabed—
<br>
<br>(I) in which hard mineral resources can be recovered in sufficient quantities to satisfy the permittee's estimated production requirements over the initial 20-year term of the permit in an efficient, economical, and orderly manner with due regard for conservation and protection of the environment, taking into consideration the resource data, other relevant physical and environmental characteristics, and the state of the technology of the applicant set out in the recovery plan;
<br>
<br>(II) which is not larger than is necessary to satisfy the permittee's estimated production requirements over the initial 20-year term of the permit; and
<br>
<br>(III) in relation to which the permittee's estimated production requirements are not found by the Administrator to be unreasonable.
<br>(b) Priority of right for issuance
<br>
<br>Subject to section 1411(b) of this title, priority of right for the issuance of licenses to applicants shall be established on the basis of the chronological order in which license applications which are in substantial compliance with the requirements established under subsection (a)(2) of this section are filed with the Administrator. Priority of right shall not be lost in the case of any application filed which is in substantial but not full compliance with such requirements if the applicant thereafter brings the application into conformity with such requirements within such reasonable period of time as the Administrator shall prescribe in regulations.
<br>(c) Eligibility for certification
<br>
<br>Before the Administrator may certify any application for issuance or transfer of a license for exploration or permit for commercial recovery, the Administrator must find in writing, after consultation with other departments and agencies pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, that—
<br>
<br>(1) the applicant has demonstrated that, upon issuance or transfer of the license or permit, the applicant will be financially responsible to meet all obligations which may be required of a licensee or permittee to engage in the exploration or commercial recovery proposed in the application;
<br>
<br>(2) the applicant has demonstrated that, upon issuance or transfer of the license or permit, the applicant will have the technological capability to engage in such exploration or commercial recovery;
<br>
<br>(3) the applicant has satisfactorily fulfilled all obligations under any license or permit previously issued or transferred to the applicant under this chapter; and
<br>
<br>(4) the proposed exploration plan or recovery plan of the applicant meets the requirements of this chapter and the regulations issued under this chapter.
<br>(d) Antitrust review
<br>
<br>(1) Whenever the Administrator receives any application for issuance or transfer of a license for exploration or permit for commercial recovery, the Administrator shall transmit promptly a complete copy of such application to the Attorney General of the United States and the Federal Trade Commission.
<br>
<br>(2) The Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission shall conduct such antitrust review of the application as they deem appropriate and shall, if they deem appropriate, advise the Administrator of the likely effects of such issuance or transfer on competition.
<br>
<br>(3) The Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission may make any recommendations they deem advisable to avoid any action upon such application by the Administrator which would create or maintain a situation inconsistent with the antitrust laws. Such recommendations may include, without limitation, the denial of issuance or transfer of the license or permit or issuance or transfer upon such terms and conditions as may be appropriate.
<br>
<br>(4) Any advice or recommendation submitted by the Attorney General or the Federal Trade Commission pursuant to this subsection shall be submitted within 90 days after receipt by them of the application. The Administrator shall not issue or transfer the license or permit during that 90-day period, except upon written confirmation by the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission that neither intends to submit any further advice or recommendation with respect to the application.
<br>
<br>(5) If the Administrator decides to issue or transfer the license or permit with respect to which denial of the issuance or transfer of the license or permit has been recommended by the Attorney General or the Federal Trade Commission, or to issue or transfer the license or permit without imposing those terms and conditions recommended by the Attorney General or the Federal Trade Commission as appropriate to prevent any situation inconsistent with the antitrust laws, the Administrator shall, prior to or upon issuance or transfer of the license or permit, notify the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission of the reasons for such decision.
<br>
<br>(6) The issuance or transfer of a license or permit under this subchapter shall not be admissible in any way as a defense to any civil or criminal action for violation of the antitrust laws of the United States, nor shall it in any way modify or abridge any private right of action under such laws.
<br>
<br>(7) As used in this subsection, the term "antitrust laws" means the Act of July 2, 1890 (commonly known as the Sherman Act; 15 U.S.C. 1–7); sections 73 through 76 of the Act of August 27, 1894 (commonly known as the Wilson Tariff Act; 15 U.S.C. 8–11); the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12 et seq.); the Act of June 19, 1936 (commonly known as the Robinson-Patman Price Discrimination Act; 15 U.S.C. 13–13b and 21a); and the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.).
<br>(e) Other Federal agencies
<br>
<br>The Administrator shall provide by regulation for full consultation and cooperation, prior to certification of an application for the issuance or transfer of any license for exploration or permit for commercial recovery and prior to the issuance or transfer of such a license or permit, with other Federal agencies or departments which have programs or activities within their statutory responsibilities which would be affected by the activities proposed in the application for the issuance or transfer of a license or permit. Not later than 30 days after June 28, 1980, the heads of any Federal departments or agencies having expertise concerning, or jurisdiction over, any aspect of the recovery or processing of hard mineral resources shall transmit to the Administrator written comments as to their expertise or statutory responsibilities pursuant to this chapter or any other Federal law. To the extent possible, such agencies shall cooperate to reduce the number of separate actions required to satisfy the statutory responsibilities of these agencies. The Administrator shall transmit to each such agency or department a complete copy of each application and each such agency or department, based on its legal responsibilities and authorities, may, not later than 60 days after receipt of the application, recommend certification of the application, issuance or transfer of the license or permit, or denial of such certification, issuance, or transfer. In any case in which an agency or department recommends such a denial, it shall set forth in detail the manner in which the application does not comply with any law or regulation within its area of responsibility and shall indicate how the application may be amended, or how terms, conditions, or restrictions might be added to the license or permit, to assure compliance with such law or regulation.
<br>(f) Review period
<br>
<br>All time periods for the review of an application for issuance or transfer of a license or permit established pursuant to this section shall, to the maximum extent practicable, run concurrently from the date on which the application is received by the Administrator.
<br>(g) Application certification
<br>
<br>Upon making the applicable determinations and findings required in sections 1411, 1412 of this title, and this section with respect to any applicant for the issuance or transfer of a license or a permit and the exploration or commercial recovery proposed by such applicant, after completion of procedures for receiving the application required by this chapter, and upon payment by the applicant of the fee required under section 1414 of this title, the Administrator shall certify the application for the issuance or transfer of the license or permit. The Administrator, to the maximum extent possible, shall endeavor to complete certification action on the application within 100 days after its submission. If final certification or denial of certification has not occurred within 100 days after submission of the application, the Administrator shall inform the applicant in writing of the then pending unresolved issues, the Administrator's efforts to resolve them, and an estimate of the time required to do so.

<br>§1415. License and permit terms, conditions, and restrictions; issuance and transfer of licenses and permits
<br>(a) Eligibility for issuance or transfer of license or permit
<br>
<br>Before issuing or transferring a license for exploration or permit for commercial recovery, the Administrator must find in writing, after consultation with interested departments and agencies pursuant to section 1413(e) of this title, and upon considering public comments received with respect to the license or permit, that the exploration or commercial recovery proposed in the application—
<br>
<br>(1) will not unreasonably interfere with the exercise of the freedoms of the high seas by other states, as recognized under general principles of international law;
<br>
<br>(2) will not conflict with any international obligation of the United States established by any treaty or international convention in force with respect to the United States;
<br>
<br>(3) will not create a situation which may reasonably be expected to lead to a breach of international peace and security involving armed conflict;
<br>
<br>(4) cannot reasonably be expected to result in a significant adverse effect on the quality of the environment, taking into account the analyses and information in any applicable environmental impact statement prepared pursuant to section 1419(c) or 1419(d) of this title; and
<br>
<br>(5) will not pose an inordinate threat to the safety of life and property at sea.
<br>(b) Issuance and transfer of licenses and permits with terms, conditions, and restrictions
<br>
<br>(1) Within 180 days after certification of any application for the issuance or transfer of a license or permit under section 1413(g) of this title, the Administrator shall propose terms and conditions for, and restrictions on, the exploration or commercial recovery proposed in the application which are consistent with the provisions of this chapter and regulations issued under this chapter. If additional time is needed, the Administrator shall notify the applicant in writing of the reasons for the delay and indicate the approximate date on which the proposed terms, conditions, and restrictions will be completed. The Administrator shall provide to each applicant a written statement of the proposed terms, conditions, and restrictions. Such terms, conditions, and restrictions shall be generally specified in regulations with general criteria and standards to be used in establishing such terms, conditions, and restrictions for a license or permit and shall be uniform in all licenses or permits, except to the extent that differing physical and environmental conditions require the establishment of special terms, conditions, and restrictions for the conservation of natural resources, protection of the environment, or the safety of life and property at sea.
<br>
<br>(2) After preparation and consideration of the final environmental impact statement pursuant to section 1419(d) of this title on the proposed issuance of a license or permit and subject to the other provisions of this chapter, the Administrator shall issue to the applicant the license or permit with the terms, conditions, and restrictions incorporated therein.
<br>
<br>(3) The licensee or permittee to whom a license or permit is issued or transferred shall be deemed to have accepted the terms, conditions, and restrictions in the license or permit if the licensee or permittee does not notify the Administrator within 60 days after receipt of the license or permit of each term, condition, or restriction with which the licensee or permittee takes exception. The licensee or permittee may, in addition to such objections as may be raised under applicable provisions of law, object to any term, condition, or restriction on the ground that the term, condition, or restriction is inconsistent with this chapter or the regulations promulgated thereunder. If, after the Administrator takes final action on these objections, the licensee or permittee demonstrates that a dispute remains on a material issue of fact, the licensee or permittee is entitled to a decision on the record after the opportunity for an agency hearing pursuant to sections 556 and 557 of title 5. Any such decision made by the Administrator shall be subject to judicial review as provided in chapter 7 of title 5.
<br>(c) Modification and revision of terms, conditions, and restrictions
<br>
<br>(1) After the issuance or transfer of any license or permit under subsection (b), the Administrator, after consultation with interested agencies and the licensee or permittee, may modify any term, condition, or restriction in such license or permit—
<br>
<br>(A) to avoid unreasonable interference with the interests of other states in their exercise of the freedoms of the high seas, as recognized under general principles of international law;
<br>
<br>(B) if relevant data and other information (including, but not limited to, data resulting from exploration or commercial recovery activities under the license or permit) indicate that modification is required to protect the quality of the environment or to promote the safety of life and property at sea and if such modification is consistent with the regulations issued to carry out section 1419(b) of this title;
<br>
<br>(C) to avoid a conflict with any international obligation of the United States, established by any treaty or convention in force with respect to the United States, as determined in writing by the President; or
<br>
<br>(D) to avoid any situation which may reasonably be expected to lead to a breach of international peace and security involving armed conflict, as determined in writing by the President.
<br>
<br>(2) During the term of a license or a permit, the licensee or permittee may submit to the Administrator an application for a revision of the license or permit or the exploration plan or recovery plan associated with the license or permit. The Administrator shall approve such application upon a finding in writing that the revision will comply with the requirements of this chapter and the regulations issued under this chapter.
<br>
<br>(3) The Administrator shall establish, by regulation, guidelines for a determination of the scale or extent of a proposed modification or revision for which any or all license or permit application requirements and procedures, including a public hearing, shall apply. Any increase in the size of the area, or any change in the location of an area, to which an exploration plan or a recovery plan applies, except an incidental increase or change, must be made by application for another license or permit.
<br>
<br>(4) The procedures set forth in subsection (b)(3) of this section shall apply with respect to any modification under this subsection in the same manner, and to the same extent, as if such modification were an initial term, condition, or restriction proposed by the Administrator.
<br>(d) Prior consultations
<br>
<br>Prior to making a determination to issue, transfer, modify, or renew a license or permit under this section, the Administrator shall consult with any affected Regional Fishery Management Council established pursuant to section 1852 of title 16, if the activities undertaken pursuant to such license or permit could adversely affect any fishery within the Fishery Conservation Zone, or any anadromous species or Continental Shelf fishery resource subject to the exclusive management authority of the United States beyond such zone.

<br>§1416. Denial of certification of applications and of issuance, transfer, suspension, and revocation of licenses and permits; suspension and modification of activities
<br>(a) Denial, suspension, modification, and revocation
<br>
<br>(1) The Administrator may deny certification of an application for the issuance or transfer of, and may deny the issuance or transfer of, a license for exploration or permit for commercial recovery if the Administrator finds that the applicant, or the activities proposed to be undertaken by the applicant, do not meet the requirements set forth in section 1413(c) of this title, section 1415(a) of this title, or in any other provision of this chapter, or any regulation issued under this chapter, for the issuance or transfer of a license or permit.
<br>
<br>(2) The Administrator may—
<br>
<br>(A) in addition to, or in lieu of, the imposition of any civil penalty under section 1462(a) of this title, or in addition to the imposition of any fine under section 1463 of this title, suspend or revoke any license or permit issued under this chapter, or suspend or modify any particular activities under such a license or permit, if the licensee or permittee, as the case may be, substantially fails to comply with any provision of this chapter, any regulation issued under this chapter, or any term, condition, or restriction of the license or permit; and
<br>
<br>(B) suspend or modify particular activities under any license or permit, if the President determines that such suspension or modification is necessary (i) to avoid any conflict with any international obligation of the United States established by any treaty or convention in force with respect to the United States, or (ii) to avoid any situation which may reasonably be expected to lead to a breach of international peace and security involving armed conflict.
<br>
<br>(3) No action may be taken by the Administrator to deny issuance or transfer of or to revoke any license or permit or, except as provided in subsection (c), to suspend any license or permit or suspend or modify particular activities under a license or permit, unless the Administrator—
<br>
<br>(A) publishes in the Federal Register and gives the applicant, licensee, or permittee, as the case may be, written notice of the intention of the Administrator to deny the issuance or transfer of or to suspend, modify, or revoke the license or permit and the reason therefor; and
<br>
<br>(B) if the reason for the proposed denial, suspension, modification, or revocation is a deficiency which the applicant, licensee, or permittee can correct, affords the applicant, licensee, or permittee a reasonable time, but not more than 180 days from the date of the notice or such longer period as the Administrator may establish for good cause shown, to correct such deficiency.
<br>
<br>(4) The Administrator shall deny issuance or transfer of, or suspend or revoke, any license or permit or order the suspension or modification of particular activities under a license or permit—
<br>
<br>(A) on the thirtieth day after the date of the notice given to the applicant, licensee, or permittee under paragraph (3)(A) unless before such day the applicant, licensee, or permittee requests a review of the proposed denial, suspension, modification, or revocation; or
<br>
<br>(B) on the last day of the period established under paragraph (3)(B) in which the applicant, licensee, or permittee must correct a deficiency, if such correction has not been made before such day.
<br>(b) Administrative review of proposed denial, suspension, modification, or revocation
<br>
<br>Any applicant, licensee, or permittee, as the case may be, who makes a timely request under subsection (a) for review of a denial of issuance or transfer, or a suspension or revocation, of a license for exploration or permit for commercial recovery, or a suspension or modification of particular activities under such a license or permit, is entitled to an adjudication on the record after an opportunity for an agency hearing with respect to such denial or suspension, revocation, or modification.
<br>(c) Effect on activities; emergency orders
<br>
<br>The issuance of any notice of proposed suspension or revocation of a license for exploration or permit for commercial recovery or proposed suspension or modification of particular activities under such a license or permit shall not affect the continuation of exploration or commercial recovery activities by the licensee or permittee. The provisions of paragraphs (3) and (4) of subsection (a) and the first sentence of this subsection shall not apply when the President determines by Executive order that an immediate suspension of a license for exploration or permit for commercial recovery, or immediate suspension or modification of particular activities under such a license or permit, is necessary for the reasons set forth in subsection (a)(2)(B), or the Administrator determines that an immediate suspension of such a license or permit, or immediate suspension or modification of particular activities under such a license or permit, is necessary to prevent a significant adverse effect on the environment or to preserve the safety of life and property at sea, and the Administrator issues an emergency order requiring such immediate suspension.
<br>(d) Judicial review
<br>
<br>Any determination of the Administrator, after any appropriate administrative review under subsection (b), to certify or deny certification of an application for the issuance or transfer of, or to issue, deny issuance of, transfer, deny the transfer of, modify, renew, suspend, or revoke any license for exploration or permit for commercial recovery, or suspend or modify particular activities under such a license or permit, or any immediate suspension of such a license or permit, or immediate suspension or modification of particular activities under such a license or permit, pursuant to subsection (c), is subject to judicial review as provided in chapter 7 of title 5.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 96–283, title I, §106, June 28, 1980, 94 Stat. 565.)
<br>§1417. Duration of licenses and permits
<br>(a) Duration of a license
<br>
<br>Each license for exploration shall be issued for a period of 10 years. If the licensee has substantially complied with the license and the exploration plan associated therewith and has requested extensions of the license, the Administrator shall extend the license on terms, conditions, and restrictions consistent with this chapter and the regulations issued under this chapter for periods of not more than 5 years each.
<br>(b) Duration of a permit
<br>
<br>Each permit for commercial recovery shall be issued for a term of 20 years and for so long thereafter as hard mineral resources are recovered annually in commercial quantities from the area to which the recovery plan associated with the permit applies. The permit of any permittee who is not recovering hard mineral resources in commercial quantities at the end of 10 years shall be terminated; except that the Administrator shall for good cause shown, including force majeure, adverse economic conditions, unavoidable delays in construction, major unanticipated vessel repairs that prevent the permittee from conducting commercial recovery activities during an annual period, or other circumstances beyond the control of the permittee, extend the 10-year period, but not beyond the initial 20-year term of the permit.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 96–283, title I, §107, June 28, 1980, 94 Stat. 567.)
<br>§1418. Diligence requirements
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>The exploration plan or recovery plan and the terms, conditions, and restrictions of each license and permit issued under this subchapter shall be designed to assure diligent development. Each licensee shall pursue diligently the activities described in the exploration plan of the licensee, and each permittee shall pursue diligently the activities described in the recovery plan of the permittee.
<br>(b) Expenditures
<br>
<br>Each license shall require such periodic reasonable expenditures for exploration by the licensee as the Administrator shall establish, taking into account the size of the area of the deep seabed to which the exploration plan associated with the license applies and the amount of funds which is estimated by the Administrator to be required for commercial recovery of hard mineral resources to begin within the time limit established by the Administrator. Such required expenditures shall not be established at a level which would discourage exploration by persons with less costly technology than is prevalently in use.
<br>(c) Commercial recovery
<br>
<br>Once commercial recovery is achieved, the Administrator shall, within reasonable limits and taking into consideration all relevant factors, require the permittee to maintain commercial recovery throughout the period of the permit; except that the Administrator shall for good cause shown, including force majeure, adverse economic conditions, or other circumstances beyond the control of the permittee, authorize the temporary suspension of commercial recovery activities. The duration of such a suspension shall not exceed one year at any one time, unless the Administrator determines that conditions justify an extension of the suspension.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 96–283, title I, §108, June 28, 1980, 94 Stat. 567.)
<br>§1419. Protection of the environment
<br>(a) Environmental assessment
<br>(1) Deep ocean mining environmental study (DOMES)
<br>
<br>The Administrator shall expand and accelerate the program assessing the effects on the environment from exploration and commercial recovery activities, including seabased processing and the disposal at sea of processing wastes, so as to provide an assessment, as accurate as practicable, of environmental impacts of such activities for the implementation of subsections (b), (c), and (d).
<br>(2) Supporting ocean research
<br>
<br>The Administrator also shall conduct a continuing program of ocean research to support environmental assessment activity through the period of exploration and commercial recovery authorized by this chapter. The program shall include the development, acceleration, and expansion, as appropriate, of studies of the ecological, geological, and physical aspects of the deep seabed in general areas of the ocean where exploration and commercial development under the authority of this chapter are likely to occur, including, but not limited to—
<br>
<br>(A) natural diversity of the deep seabed biota;
<br>
<br>(B) life histories of major benthic, midwater, and surface organisms most likely to be affected by commercial recovery activities;
<br>
<br>(C) long- and short-term effects of commercial recovery on the deep seabed biota; and
<br>
<br>(D) assessment of the effects of seabased processing activities.
<br>
<br>Within 160 days after June 28, 1980, the Administrator shall prepare a plan to carry out the program described in this subsection, including necessary funding levels for the next five fiscal years, and shall submit the plan to the Congress.
<br>(b) Terms, conditions, and restrictions
<br>
<br>Each license and permit issued under this subchapter shall contain such terms, conditions, and restrictions, established by the Administrator, which prescribe the actions the licensee or permittee shall take in the conduct of exploration and commercial recovery activities to assure protection of the environment. The Administrator shall require in all activities under new permits, and wherever practicable in activities under existing permits, the use of the best available technologies for the protection of safety, health, and the environment wherever such activities would have a significant effect on safety, health, or the environment, except where the Administrator determines that the incremental benefits are clearly insufficient to justify the incremental costs of using such technologies. Before establishing such terms, conditions, and restrictions, the Administrator shall consult with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Secretary of State, and the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, concerning such terms, conditions, and restrictions, and the Administrator shall take into account and give due consideration to the information contained in each final environmental impact statement prepared with respect to such license or permit pursuant to subsection (d).
<br>(c) Programmatic environmental impact statement
<br>
<br>(1) If the Administrator, in consultation with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and with the assistance of other appropriate Federal agencies, determines that a programmatic environmental impact statement is required, the Administrator shall, as soon as practicable after June 28, 1980, with respect to the areas of the oceans in which any United States citizen is expected to undertake exploration and commercial recovery under the authority of this chapter—
<br>
<br>(A) prepare and publish draft programmatic environmental impact statements which assess the environmental impacts of exploration and commercial recovery in such areas;
<br>
<br>(B) afford all interested parties a reasonable time after such dates of publication to submit comments to the Administrator on such draft statements; and
<br>
<br>(C) thereafter prepare (giving full consideration to all comments submitted under subparagraph (B)) and publish final programmatic environmental impact statements regarding such areas.
<br>
<br>(2) With respect to the area of the oceans in which exploration and commercial recovery by any United States citizen will likely first occur under the authority of this chapter, the Administrator shall prepare a draft and final programmatic environmental impact statement as required under paragraph (1), except that—
<br>
<br>(A) the draft programmatic environmental impact statement shall be prepared and published as soon as practicable but not later than 270 days (or such longer period as the Administrator may establish for good cause shown) after June 28, 1980; and
<br>
<br>(B) the final programmatic environmental impact statement shall be prepared and published within 180 days (or such longer period as the Administrator may establish for good cause shown) after the date on which the draft statement is published.
<br>(d) Environmental impact statements on issuance of licenses and permits
<br>
<br>The issuance of, but not the certification of an application for, any license or permit under this subchapter shall be deemed to be a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment for purposes of section 4332 of title 42. In preparing an environmental impact statement pursuant to this subsection, the Administrator shall consult with the agency heads referred to in subsection (b) and shall take into account, and give due consideration to, the relevant information contained in any applicable studies and any other environmental impact statement prepared pursuant to this section. Each draft environmental impact statement prepared pursuant to this subsection shall be published, with the terms, conditions, and restrictions proposed pursuant to section 1415(b) of this title, within 180 days (or such longer period as the Administrator may establish for good cause shown in writing) following the date on which the application for the license or permit concerned is certified by the Administrator. Each final environmental impact statement shall be published 180 days (or such longer period as the Administrator may establish for good cause shown in writing) following the date on which the draft environmental impact statement is published.
<br>(e) Effect on other law
<br>
<br>For the purposes of this chapter, any vessel or other floating craft engaged in commercial recovery or exploration shall not be deemed to be "a vessel or other floating craft" under section 502(12)(B) of the Clean Water Act [33 U.S.C. 1362(12)(B)] and any discharge of a pollutant from such vessel or other floating craft shall be subject to the Clean Water Act [33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.].
<br>(f) Stable reference areas
<br>
<br>(1) Within one year after June 28, 1980, the Secretary of State shall, in cooperation with the Administrator and as part of the international consultations pursuant to section 1428(f) of this title, negotiate with all nations that are identified in such subsection for the purpose of establishing international stable reference areas in which no mining shall take place: Provided, however, That this subsection shall not be construed as requiring any substantial withdrawal of deep seabed areas from deep seabed mining authorized by this chapter.
<br>
<br>(2) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as authorizing the United States to unilaterally establish such reference area or areas nor shall the United States recognize the unilateral claim to such reference area or areas by any State.
<br>
<br>(3) Within four years after June 28, 1980, the Secretary of State shall submit a report to Congress on the progress of establishing such stable reference areas, including the designation of appropriate zones to insure a representative and stable biota of the deep seabed.
<br>
<br>(4) For purposes of this section "stable reference areas" shall mean an area or areas of the deep seabed to be used as a reference zone or zones for purposes of resource evaluation and environmental assessment of deep seabed mining in which no mining will occur.

<br>§1420. Conservation of natural resources
<br>
<br>For the purpose of conservation of natural resources, each license and permit issued under this subchapter shall contain, as needed, terms, conditions, and restrictions which have due regard for the prevention of waste and the future opportunity for the commercial recovery of the unrecovered balance of the hard mineral resources in the area to which the license or permit applies. In establishing these terms, conditions, and restrictions, the Administrator shall consider the state of the technology, the processing system utilized and the value and potential use of any waste, the environmental effects of the exploration or commercial recovery activities, economic and resource data, and the national need for hard mineral resources. As used in this chapter, the term "conservation of natural resources" is not intended to grant, imply, or create any inference of production controls or price regulation, in particular those which would affect the volume of production, prices, profits, markets, or the decision of which minerals or metals are to be recovered, except as such effects may be incidental to actions taken pursuant to this section.
