<br>(B) for a drug initially approved without elements to assure safe use, other elements under subsections (c), (d), and (e) are not sufficient to mitigate such serious risk.
<br>(2) Assuring access and minimizing burden
<br>
<br>Such elements to assure safe use under paragraph (1) shall—
<br>
<br>(A) be commensurate with the specific serious risk listed in the labeling of the drug;
<br>
<br>(B) within 30 days of the date on which any element under paragraph (1) is imposed, be posted publicly by the Secretary with an explanation of how such elements will mitigate the observed safety risk;
<br>
<br>(C) considering such risk, not be unduly burdensome on patient access to the drug, considering in particular—
<br>
<br>(i) patients with serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions;
<br>
<br>(ii) patients who have difficulty accessing health care (such as patients in rural or medically underserved areas); and
<br>
<br>(iii) patients with functional limitations; and
<br>
<br>(D) to the extent practicable, so as to minimize the burden on the health care delivery system—
<br>
<br>(i) conform with elements to assure safe use for other drugs with similar, serious risks; and
<br>
<br>(ii) be designed to be compatible with established distribution, procurement, and dispensing systems for drugs.
<br>(3) Elements to assure safe use
<br>
<br>The elements to assure safe use under paragraph (1) shall include 1 or more goals to mitigate a specific serious risk listed in the labeling of the drug and, to mitigate such risk, may require that—
<br>
<br>(A) health care providers who prescribe the drug have particular training or experience, or are specially certified (the opportunity to obtain such training or certification with respect to the drug shall be available to any willing provider from a frontier area in a widely available training or certification method (including an on-line course or via mail) as approved by the Secretary at reasonable cost to the provider);
<br>
<br>(B) pharmacies, practitioners, or health care settings that dispense the drug are specially certified (the opportunity to obtain such certification shall be available to any willing provider from a frontier area);
<br>
<br>(C) the drug be dispensed to patients only in certain health care settings, such as hospitals;
<br>
<br>(D) the drug be dispensed to patients with evidence or other documentation of safe-use conditions, such as laboratory test results;

<br>(E) each patient using the drug be subject to certain monitoring; or
<br>
<br>(F) each patient using the drug be enrolled in a registry.
<br>(4) Implementation system
<br>
<br>The elements to assure safe use under paragraph (1) that are described in subparagraphs (B), (C), and (D) of paragraph (3) may include a system through which the applicant is able to take reasonable steps to—
<br>
<br>(A) monitor and evaluate implementation of such elements by health care providers, pharmacists, and other parties in the health care system who are responsible for implementing such elements; and
<br>
<br>(B) work to improve implementation of such elements by such persons.
<br>(5) Evaluation of elements to assure safe use
<br>
<br>The Secretary, through the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee (or successor committee) or other advisory committee of the Food and Drug Administration, shall—
<br>
<br>(A) seek input from patients, physicians, pharmacists, and other health care providers about how elements to assure safe use under this subsection for 1 or more drugs may be standardized so as not to be—
<br>
<br>(i) unduly burdensome on patient access to the drug; and
<br>
<br>(ii) to the extent practicable, minimize the burden on the health care delivery system;
<br>
<br>(B) periodically evaluate, for 1 or more drugs, the elements to assure safe use of such drug to assess whether the elements—
<br>
<br>(i) assure safe use of the drug;
<br>
<br>(ii) are not unduly burdensome on patient access to the drug; and
<br>
<br>(iii) to the extent practicable, minimize the burden on the health care delivery system; and
<br>
<br>(C) considering such input and evaluations—
<br>
<br>(i) issue or modify agency guidance about how to implement the requirements of this subsection; and
<br>
<br>(ii) modify elements under this subsection for 1 or more drugs as appropriate.
<br>(6) Additional mechanisms to assure access
<br>
<br>The mechanisms under section 360bbb of this title to provide for expanded access for patients with serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may be used to provide access for patients with a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, the treatment of which is not an approved use for the drug, to a drug that is subject to elements to assure safe use under this subsection. The Secretary shall promulgate regulations for how a physician may provide the drug under the mechanisms of section 360bbb of this title.
<br>(7) Repealed. Pub. L. 113–5, title III, §302(c)(1), Mar. 13, 2013, 127 Stat. 185
<br>(8) Limitation
<br>
<br>No holder of an approved covered application shall use any element to assure safe use required by the Secretary under this subsection to block or delay approval of an application under section 355(b)(2) or (j) of this title or to prevent application of such element under subsection (i)(1)(B) to a drug that is the subject of an abbreviated new drug application.

<br>
<br>(I) a single, shared system with the listed drug under subsection (f); or
<br>
<br>(II) a different, comparable aspect of the elements to assure safe use under subsection (f).
<br>
<br>(ii) The Secretary may require a drug that is the subject of an application under section 355(j) of this title and the listed drug to use a single, shared system under subsection (f), if the Secretary determines that no different, comparable aspect of the elements to assure safe use could satisfy the requirements of subsection (f).
<br>(2) Action by Secretary
<br>
<br>For an applicable listed drug for which a drug is approved under section 355(j) of this title, the Secretary—
<br>
<br>(A) shall undertake any communication plan to health care providers required under subsection (e)(3) for the applicable listed drug;
<br>
<br>(B) shall permit packaging systems and safe disposal packaging or safe disposal systems that are different from those required for the applicable listed drug under subsection (e)(4); and
<br>
<br>(C) shall inform the responsible person for the drug that is so approved if the risk evaluation and mitigation strategy for the applicable listed drug is modified.
<br>(3) Shared REMS
<br>
<br>If the Secretary approves, in accordance with paragraph (1)(C)(i)(II), a different, comparable aspect of the elements to assure safe use under subsection (f) for a drug that is the subject of an abbreviated new drug application under section 355(j) of this title, the Secretary may require that such different comparable aspect of the elements to assure safe use can be used with respect to any other drug that is the subject of an application under section 355(j) or 355(b) of this title that references the same listed drug.
<br>(j) Drug Safety Oversight Board
<br>(1) In general
<br>
