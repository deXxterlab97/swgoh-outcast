<br>(a) Short title
<br>
<br>This chapter may be cited as the "Telephone Disclosure and Dispute Resolution Act".
<br>(b) Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds the following:
<br>
<br>(1) The use of pay-per-call services, most commonly through the use of 900 telephone numbers, has grown exponentially in the past few years into a national, billion-dollar industry as a result of recent technological innovations. Such services are convenient to consumers, cost-effective to vendors, and profitable to communications common carriers.
<br>
<br>(2) Many pay-per-call businesses provide valuable information, increase consumer choices, and stimulate innovative and responsive services that benefit the public.
<br>
<br>(3) The interstate nature of the pay-per-call industry means that its activities are beyond the reach of individual States and therefore requires Federal regulatory treatment to protect the public interest.
<br>
<br>(4) The lack of nationally uniform regulatory guidelines has led to confusion for callers, subscribers, industry participants, and regulatory agencies as to the rights of callers and the oversight responsibilities of regulatory authorities, and has allowed some pay-per-call businesses to engage in practices that abuse the rights of consumers.
<br>
<br>(5) Some interstate pay-per-call businesses have engaged in practices which are misleading to the consumer, harmful to the public interest, or contrary to accepted standards of business practices and thus cause harm to the many reputable businesses that are serving the public.
<br>
<br>(6) Because the consumer most often incurs a financial obligation as soon as a pay-per-call transaction is completed, the accuracy and descriptiveness of vendor advertisements become crucial in avoiding consumer abuse. The obligation for accuracy should include price-per-call and duration-of-call information, odds disclosure for lotteries, games, and sweepstakes, and obligations for obtaining parental consent from callers under 18.
<br>
<br>(7) The continued growth of the legitimate pay-per-call industry is dependent upon consumer confidence that unfair and deceptive behavior will be effectively curtailed and that consumers will have adequate rights of redress.
<br>
<br>(8) Vendors of telephone-billed goods and services must also feel confident in their rights and obligations for resolving billing disputes if they are to use this new marketplace for the sale of products of more than nominal value.

<br>SUBCHAPTER I—REGULATION OF UNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE ACTS AND PRACTICES IN CONNECTION WITH PAY-PER-CALL SERVICES
<br>§5711. Federal Trade Commission regulations
<br>(a) In general
<br>(1) Advertising regulations
<br>
<br>The Commission shall prescribe rules in accordance with this subsection to prohibit unfair and deceptive acts and practices in any advertisement for pay-per-call services. Such rules shall require that the person offering such pay-per-call services—
<br>
<br>(A) clearly and conspicuously disclose in any advertising the cost of the use of such telephone number, including the total cost or the cost per minute and any other fees for that service and for any other pay-per-call service to which the caller may be transferred;
<br>
<br>(B) in the case of an advertisement which offers a prize or award or a service or product at no cost or for a reduced cost, clearly and conspicuously disclose the odds of being able to receive such prize, award, service, or product at no cost or reduced cost, or, if such odds are not calculable in advance, disclose the factors determining such odds;
<br>
<br>(C) in the case of an advertisement that promotes a service that is not operated or expressly authorized by a Federal agency but that provides information on a Federal program, include at the beginning of such advertisement a clear disclosure that the service is not authorized, endorsed, or approved by any Federal agency;
<br>
<br>(D) shall not direct such advertisement at children under the age of 12, unless such service is a bona fide educational service;
<br>
<br>(E) in the case of advertising directed primarily to individuals under the age of 18, clearly and conspicuously state in such advertising that such individual must have the consent of such individual's parent or legal guardian for the use of such services;
<br>
<br>(F) be prohibited from using advertisements that emit electronic tones which can automatically dial a pay-per-call telephone number;
<br>
<br>(G) ensure that, whenever the number to be called is shown in television and print media advertisements, the charges for the call are clear and conspicuous and (when shown in television advertisements) displayed for the same duration as that number is displayed;
<br>
<br>(H) in delivering any telephone message soliciting calls to a pay-per-call service, specify clearly, and at no less than the audible volume of the solicitation, the total cost and the cost per minute and any other fees for that service and for any other pay-per-call service to which the caller may be transferred; and
<br>
<br>(I) not advertise an 800 telephone number, or any other telephone number advertised or widely understood to be toll free, from which callers are connected to an access number for a pay-per-call service.
<br>(2) Pay-per-call service standards
<br>
<br>The Commission shall prescribe rules to require that each provider of pay-per-call services—
<br>
<br>(A) include in each pay-per-call message an introductory disclosure message that—
<br>
<br>(i) describes the service being provided;
<br>
<br>(ii) specifies clearly and at a reasonably understandable volume the total cost or the cost per minute and any other fees for that service and for any other pay-per-call service to which the caller may be transferred;
<br>
<br>(iii) informs the caller that charges for the call begin at the end of the introductory message;
<br>
<br>(iv) informs the caller that parental consent is required for calls made by children; and
<br>
<br>(v) in the case of a pay-per-call service that is not operated or expressly authorized by a Federal agency but that provides information on any Federal program, a statement that clearly states that the service is not authorized, endorsed, or approved by any Federal agency;
<br>
<br>(B) enable the caller to hang up at or before the end of the introductory message without incurring any charge whatsoever;
<br>
<br>(C) not direct such services at children under the age of 12, unless such service is a bona fide educational service;
<br>
<br>(D) stop the assessment of time-based charges immediately upon disconnection by the caller;
<br>
<br>(E) disable any bypass mechanism which allows frequent callers to avoid listening to the disclosure message described in subparagraph (A) after the institution of any price increase and for a period of time sufficient to give such frequent callers adequate and sufficient notice of the price change;
<br>
<br>(F) be prohibited from providing pay-per-call services through an 800 number or other telephone number advertised or widely understood to be toll free;
<br>
<br>(G) be prohibited from billing consumers in excess of the amounts described in the introductory message and from billing for services provided in violation of the rules prescribed by the Commission pursuant to this section;
<br>
<br>(H) ensure that any billing statement for such provider's charges shall—
<br>
<br>(i) display any charges for pay-per-call services in a part of the consumer's bill that is identified as not being related to local and long distance telephone charges; and
<br>
<br>(ii) for each charge so displayed, specify, at a minimum, the type of service, the amount of the charge, and the date, time, and duration of the call;
<br>
<br>(I) be liable for refunds to consumers who have been billed for pay-per-call services pursuant to programs that have been found to have violated the regulations prescribed pursuant to this section or subchapter II of this chapter or any other Federal law; and
<br>
<br>(J) comply with such additional standards as the Commission may prescribe to prevent abusive practices.
<br>(3) Access to information
<br>
<br>The Commission shall by rule require a common carrier that provides telephone services to a provider of pay-per-call services to make available to the Commission any records and financial information maintained by such carrier relating to the arrangements (other than for the provision of local exchange service) between such carrier and any provider of pay-per-call services.
<br>(4) Evasions
<br>
<br>The rules issued by the Commission under this section shall include provisions to prohibit unfair or deceptive acts or practices that evade such rules or undermine the rights provided to customers under this subchapter, including through the use of alternative billing or other procedures.
<br>(5) Exemptions
<br>
<br>The regulations prescribed by the Commission pursuant to paragraph (2)(A) may exempt from the requirements of such paragraph—
<br>
<br>(A) calls from frequent callers or regular subscribers using a bypass mechanism to avoid listening to the disclosure message required by such regulations, subject to the requirements of paragraph (2)(E); or
<br>
<br>(B) pay-per-call services provided at nominal charges, as defined by the Commission in such regulations.
<br>(6) Consideration of other rules required
<br>
<br>In conducting a proceeding under this section, the Commission shall consider requiring, by rule or regulation, that providers of pay-per-call services—
<br>
<br>(A) automatically disconnect a call after one full cycle of the program; and
<br>
<br>(B) include a beep tone or other appropriate and clear signal during a live interactive group program so that callers will be alerted to the passage of time.
<br>(7) Special rule for infrequent publications
<br>
<br>The rules prescribed by the Commission under subparagraphs (A) and (G) of paragraph (1) may permit, in the case of publications that are widely distributed, that are printed annually or less frequently, and that have an established policy of not publishing specific prices, advertising that in lieu of the cost disclosures required by such subparagraphs, clearly and conspicuously disclose that use of the telephone number may result in a substantial charge.
<br>(8) Treatment of rules
<br>
<br>A rule issued under this subsection shall be treated as a rule issued under section 57a(a)(1)(B) of this title.
<br>(b) Rulemaking
<br>
<br>The Commission shall prescribe the rules under subsection (a) within 270 days after October 28, 1992. Such rules shall be prescribed in accordance with section 553 of title 5.
<br>(c) Enforcement
<br>
<br>Any violation of any rule prescribed under subsection (a) shall be treated as a violation of a rule respecting unfair or deceptive acts or practices under section 45 of this title. Notwithstanding section 45(a)(2) of this title, communications common carriers shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission for purposes of this subchapter.

<br>§5901. Findings
<br>
<br>Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) the distribution of goods and services to consumers in the United States requires the free flow of currency, bullion, securities, supplemental nutrition assistance program benefits, and other items of unusual value in interstate commerce;
<br>
<br>(2) the armored car industry transports and protects such items in interstate commerce, including daily transportation of currency and supplemental nutrition assistance program benefits valued at more than $1,000,000,000;
<br>
<br>(3) armored car crew members are often subject to armed attack by individuals attempting to steal such items;
<br>
<br>(4) to protect themselves and the items they transport, such crew members are armed with weapons;
<br>
<br>(5) various States require both weapons training and a criminal record background check before licensing a crew member to carry a weapon; and
<br>
<br>(6) there is a need for each State to reciprocally accept weapons licenses of other States for armored car crew members to assure the free and safe transport of valuable items in interstate commerce.

<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>The Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration may, in accordance with section 6002 of this title, make grants to States, political subdivisions of States, and nonprofit organizations for programs that require or encourage individuals under the age of 16 to wear approved bicycle helmets.

<br>§6101. Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>(1) Telemarketing differs from other sales activities in that it can be carried out by sellers across State lines without direct contact with the consumer. Telemarketers also can be very mobile, easily moving from State to State.
<br>
<br>(2) Interstate telemarketing fraud has become a problem of such magnitude that the resources of the Federal Trade Commission are not sufficient to ensure adequate consumer protection from such fraud.
<br>
<br>(3) Consumers and others are estimated to lose $40 billion a year in telemarketing fraud.
<br>
<br>(4) Consumers are victimized by other forms of telemarketing deception and abuse.
<br>
<br>(5) Consequently, Congress should enact legislation that will offer consumers necessary protection from telemarketing deception and abuse.

<br>Congressional Findings
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 106–534, §2, Nov. 22, 2000, 114 Stat. 2555, provided that: "Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>"(1) Older Americans are among the most rapidly growing segments of our society.
<br>
<br>"(2) Our Nation's elderly are too frequently the victims of violent crime, property crime, and consumer and telemarketing fraud.
<br>
<br>"(3) The elderly are often targeted and retargeted in a range of fraudulent schemes.
<br>
<br>"(4) The TRIAD program, originally sponsored by the National Sheriffs' Association, International Association of Chiefs of Police, and the American Association of Retired Persons unites sheriffs, police chiefs, senior volunteers, elder care providers, families, and seniors to reduce the criminal victimization of the elderly.
<br>
<br>"(5) Congress should continue to support TRIAD and similar community partnerships that improve the safety and quality of life for millions of senior citizens.
<br>
<br>"(6) There are few other community-based efforts that forge partnerships to coordinate criminal justice and social service resources to improve the safety and security of the elderly.
<br>
<br>"(7) According to the National Consumers League, telemarketing fraud costs consumers nearly $40,000,000,000 each year.
<br>
<br>"(8) Senior citizens are often the target of telemarketing fraud.
<br>
<br>"(9) Fraudulent telemarketers compile the names of consumers who are potentially vulnerable to telemarketing fraud into the so-called 'mooch lists'.
<br>
<br>"(10) It is estimated that 56 percent of the names on such 'mooch lists' are individuals age 50 or older.
<br>
<br>"(11) The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Federal Trade Commission have provided resources to assist private-sector organizations to operate outreach programs to warn senior citizens whose names appear on confiscated 'mooch lists'.
<br>
<br>"(12) The Administration on Aging was formed, in part, to provide senior citizens with the resources, information, and assistance their special circumstances require.
<br>
<br>"(13) The Administration on Aging has a system in place to inform senior citizens of the dangers of telemarketing fraud.
<br>
<br>"(14) Senior citizens need to be warned of the dangers of telemarketing fraud before they become victims of such fraud."

<br>"(a) In General.—The Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services for Aging, shall provide to the Attorney General of each State and publicly disseminate in each State, including dissemination to area agencies on aging, information designed to educate senior citizens and raise awareness about the dangers of fraud, including telemarketing and sweepstakes fraud.
<br>
<br>"(b) Information.—In carrying out subsection (a), the Secretary shall—
<br>
<br>"(1) inform senior citizens of the prevalence of telemarketing and sweepstakes fraud targeted against them;

<br>
<br>"(3) inform senior citizens how to identify telemarketing and sweepstakes fraud;

<br>
<br>"(5) inform senior citizens how to report suspected attempts at or acts of fraud;
<br>
<br>"(6) inform senior citizens of their consumer protection rights under Federal law; and
<br>
<br>"(7) provide such other information as the Secretary considers necessary to protect senior citizens against fraudulent telemarketing and sweepstakes promotions.
<br>
<br>"(c) Means of Dissemination.—The Secretary shall determine the means to disseminate information under this section. In making such determination, the Secretary shall consider—

<br>"(3) an Internet website;

<br>§6102. Telemarketing rules
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>(1) The Commission shall prescribe rules prohibiting deceptive telemarketing acts or practices and other abusive telemarketing acts or practices.
<br>
<br>(2) The Commission shall include in such rules respecting deceptive telemarketing acts or practices a definition of deceptive telemarketing acts or practices which shall include fraudulent charitable solicitations, and which may include acts or practices of entities or individuals that assist or facilitate deceptive telemarketing, including credit card laundering.
<br>
<br>(3) The Commission shall include in such rules respecting other abusive telemarketing acts or practices—
<br>

<br>
<br>(C) a requirement that any person engaged in telemarketing for the sale of goods or services shall promptly and clearly disclose to the person receiving the call that the purpose of the call is to sell goods or services and make such other disclosures as the Commission deems appropriate, including the nature and price of the goods and services; 1 and
<br>
<br>(D) a requirement that any person engaged in telemarketing for the solicitation of charitable contributions, donations, or gifts of money or any other thing of value, shall promptly and clearly disclose to the person receiving the call that the purpose of the call is to solicit charitable contributions, donations, or gifts, and make such other disclosures as the Commission considers appropriate, including the name and mailing address of the charitable organization on behalf of which the solicitation is made.
