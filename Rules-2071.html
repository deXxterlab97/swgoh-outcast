<br>§836. Employee protection
<br>(a) General
<br>
<br>Fair and equitable arrangements shall be provided, in accordance with this section, to protect the interests of any employees not otherwise protected under title V of the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 (45 U.S.C. 771 et seq.), who may be affected by actions taken pursuant to authorizations or approval obtained under this subchapter. Such arrangements shall be determined by the execution of an agreement between the representatives of the railroads and the representatives of their employees, within 120 days after February 5, 1976. In the absence of such an executed agreement, the Secretary of Labor shall prescribe the applicable protective arrangements, within 150 days after February 5, 1976.
<br>(b) Terms
<br>
<br>The arrangements required by subsection (a) of this section shall apply to each employee who has an employment relationship with a railroad on the date on which such railroad first applies for applicable financial assistance under this subchapter. Such arrangements shall include such provisions as may be necessary for the negotiation and execution of agreements as to the manner in which the protective arrangements shall be applied, including notice requirements. Such agreements shall be executed prior to implementation of work funded from financial assistance under this subchapter. If such an agreement is not reached within 30 days after the date on which an application for such assistance is approved, either party to the dispute may submit the issue for final and binding arbitration. The decision on any such arbitration shall be rendered within 30 days after such submission. Such arbitration decision shall in no way modify the protection afforded in the protective arrangements established pursuant to this section, shall be final and binding on the parties thereto, and shall become a part of the agreement. Such arrangements shall also include such provisions as may be necessary—
<br>
<br>(1) for the preservation of compensation (including subsequent general wage increases, vacation allowances, and monthly compensation guarantees), rights, privileges, and benefits (including fringe benefits such as pensions, hospitalization, and vacations, under the same conditions and so long as such benefits continue to be accorded to other employees of the employing railroad in active service or on furlough, as the case may be) to such employees under existing collective-bargaining agreements or otherwise;
<br>
<br>(2) to provide for final and binding arbitration of any dispute which cannot be settled by the parties, with respect to the interpretation, application, or enforcement of the provisions of the protective arrangements;
<br>
<br>(3) to provide that an employee who is unable to secure employment by the exercise of his or her seniority rights, as a result of actions taken with financial assistance obtained under this subchapter, shall be offered reassignment and, where necessary, retraining to fill a position comparable to the position held at the time of such adverse effect and for which he is, or by training and retraining can become, physically and mentally qualified, so long as such offer is not in contravention of collective bargaining agreements relating thereto; and
<br>
<br>(4) to provide that the protection afforded pursuant to this section shall not be applicable to employees benefited solely as a result of the work which is financed by funds provided pursuant to this subchapter.
<br>(c) Subcontracting
<br>
<br>The arrangements which are required to be negotiated by the parties or prescribed by the Secretary of Labor, pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this section, shall include provisions regulating subcontracting by the railroads of work which is financed by funds provided pursuant to this subchapter.

<br>§901. Congressional findings
<br>
<br>(a) Congress hereby finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) the severe operating losses and the deteriorating plant and equipment of the Milwaukee Railroad threaten to cause cessation of its operations in the near future;
<br>
<br>(2) a cessation of operations by the Milwaukee Railroad would have serious repercussions on the economies of the States in which such railroad principally operates (the States of Washington, Montana, Idaho, North Dakota, South Dakota, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Michigan, Indiana, Minnesota, and Wisconsin);
<br>
<br>(3) a cessation of operations of the Milwaukee Railroad would result in the loss of many thousands of jobs of railroad workers and other workers whose employment is dependent upon rail service over the lines presently operated by the Milwaukee Railroad;
<br>
<br>(4) experienced railroad employees make a valuable contribution toward strengthening the railroad industry; and other railroads have the ability and willingness to employ displaced employees of the Milwaukee Railroad;
<br>
<br>(5) the ownership by employees or by employees and shippers of part or all of the Milwaukee Railroad may be a valuable tool in reorganization and should be given serious consideration;
<br>
<br>(6) cessation of essential transportation services by the Milwaukee Railroad would endanger the public welfare;
<br>
<br>(7) cessation of such services is imminent; and
<br>
<br>(8) there is no other practicable means of obtaining funds to meet payroll and other expenses necessary for continuation of services and reorganization of the Milwaukee Railroad.
<br>
<br>(b) The Congress declares that emergency measures set forth in this chapter must be taken to restructure the Milwaukee Railroad and to avoid the potential unemployment and damage to the economy of the region and of the Nation which a cessation of essential services by the Milwaukee Railroad would otherwise cause.

<br>Pub. L. 96–101, §1, Nov. 4, 1979, 93 Stat. 736, provided: "That this Act [enacting this chapter and amending sections 231f, 662, 721, 821, and 825 of this title] may be cited as the 'Milwaukee Railroad Restructuring Act'."
<br>Statement of Purpose
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 97–468, title II, subtitle A, §211, Jan. 14, 1983, 96 Stat. 2543, provided that: "It is the purpose of this subtitle [amending sections 915 and 1017 of this title and enacting provisions set out as notes under this section] to continue the effort by Congress to assure service over the lines of rail carriers subject to liquidation in instances where rail carriers are willing to provide service over such lines and financially responsible persons are willing to purchase the lines for continued rail operations."
<br>Congressional Findings
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 97–468, title II, §212, Jan. 14, 1983, 96 Stat. 2543, provided that: "The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>"(1) it is necessary to establish procedures to facilitate and expedite the acquisition of rail lines of carriers subject to liquidation by financially responsible persons in instances where service is not being provided over the line by the carrier and where the financially responsible person seeks to provide rail service over the line;
<br>
<br>"(2) procedures set forth in the amendments made by this title [see Short Title of 1983 Amendment note above] represent an exercise of the powers of the Congress under the Constitution to regulate commerce among the several States which will provide a practicable means for preserving rail service, thus benefiting shippers, employees, and the economies of the States in which such carriers subject to liquidation have operated service, and for facilitating interstate commerce, while at the same time providing safeguards to protect the interest of the estates of such carriers by requiring compensation which is not less than the constitutionally required minimum; and
<br>
<br>"(3) it is in the public interest that the Interstate Commerce Commission's authority to issue orders involving temporary authority to operate service over lines of carriers subject to liquidation be clarified."

<br>§904. Court approved abandonments and sales
<br>(a) Abandonment of lines of railroad under section 1170 of title 11
<br>
<br>(1) Upon the occurrence of an event described in section 920(b) of this title, or on April 1, 1980, whichever first occurs, the bankruptcy court may authorize the abandonment of lines of the Milwaukee Railroad pursuant to section 1170 of title 11. Pending the expiration of the time for appeal of an abandonment order or the determination of any such appeal, the bankruptcy court may authorize the termination of service on a line to be abandoned, and the order authorizing such termination may not be stayed. In authorizing any abandonment pursuant to this section, the court shall require the carrier to provide a fair arrangement at least as protective of the interests of employees as that required under section 11347 1 of title 49.
<br>
<br>(2) Prior to the date specified in paragraph (1) of this subsection, the bankruptcy court may hear and consider any request for the abandonment of lines of the Milwaukee Railroad, and may fix the time for the Commission's report on the request, but it may take final action authorizing such abandonment only in accordance with such paragraph (1).
<br>(b) Sale or transfer of lines of railroad
<br>
<br>(1) Upon the occurrence of an event described in section 920(b) of this title, or on April 1, 1980, whichever first occurs, the bankruptcy court may authorize the sale or transfer of a line of the Milwaukee Railroad to be used in continued rail operations, subject to the approval of the Commission under paragraph (2) of this subsection. In authorizing any such sale or transfer, the court shall provide a fair arrangement at least as protective of the interest 2 of employees as that required under section 11347 1 of title 49.
<br>
<br>(2) The bankruptcy court may not authorize a sale or transfer pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection unless an appropriate application with respect to such sale or transfer is initiated with the Commission and, within such time as the court may fix, not exceeding 180 days, the Commission, with or without a hearing, as the Commission may determine, and with or without modification or condition, approves such application, or does not act on such application. Any action or order of the Commission approving, modifying, conditioning, or disapproving such application is subject to review by the court only under sections 706(2)(A), 706(2)(B), 706(2)(C), and 706(2)(D) of title 5. An application may be initiated with the Commission prior to the date specified in paragraph (1) of this subsection.
<br>
<br>(3) Pending review of an application by the Commission pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, the bankruptcy court may, on a preliminary basis, authorize the sale or transfer of lines of the Milwaukee Railroad to another rail carrier. The court may permit the purchasing carrier to operate interim service as a common carrier over the lines to be purchased, without regard to section 10901 of title 49. In operating such service, the purchasing carrier shall use employees of the Milwaukee Railroad to the extent necessary for the operation of such service. The bankruptcy court may take final action authorizing any such sale or transfer only in accordance with paragraph (1) of this subsection.
