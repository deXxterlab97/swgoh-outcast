<br>
<br>• Establishing the policies for performing such functions as are transferred to the Director by Section 451 of the Act [6 U.S.C. 271] or otherwise vested in the Director by law.

<br>
<br>• Advising the Deputy Secretary with respect to any policy or operation of the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services that may affect the Bureau of Border Security [now Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement] of the Department, including potentially conflicting policies or operations.
<br>
<br>• Establishing national immigration services policies and priorities.

<br>

<br>
<br>b. Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman: Will report directly to the Deputy Secretary; and will be responsible for the following:
<br>
<br>• Assisting individuals and employers in resolving problems with the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services;
<br>
<br>• Identifying areas in which individuals and employers have problems in dealing with the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services; and
<br>
<br>• Proposing changes in the administrative practices of the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services to mitigate identified problems.
<br>
<br>(3) Specification of the funds available to each agency that will be transferred to the Department as a result of transfers under the plan.
<br>
<br>• The attached tables [not set out in the Code] provide estimates of the funds available to the agencies and entities that will be transferred to the Department by operation of the Act. The two tables include total funding (mandatory and discretionary including fees) and discretionary funding net of fees. The tables provide the enacted levels for 2002 and 2002 supplementals, and the President's requested levels for 2003.
<br>
<br>Because of the current state of the 2003 budget process, information concerning the funds that will be available to each transferring agency on the date of the proposed transfers is not currently available and will not likely be available during the time period in which the President is to submit this Reorganization Plan. As additional information becomes available, it will be provided as may be required in accordance with the procedures under the Act for modification of this Plan or other applicable law.
<br>
<br>(4) Specification of the proposed allocations within the Department of unexpended funds transferred in connection with transfers under the plan.
<br>
<br>• The attached tables [not set out in the Code] provide estimates of the unobligated balances as of September 30, 2002, for the agencies and programs that will be transferred to the Department. The first table provides estimates of unobligated balances for the accounts that are moving to the Department in whole. The second table provides estimates of the unobligated balances in the accounts of which only a portion will be transferring to the new Department. These latter estimates, however, are of the unobligated balances for the full account, only a portion of which are associated with the activities that will be transferred to the Department. In addition, these unobligated balances are based on the Department of Treasury's estimates as of September 30, 2002, which are the latest available figures. Since October 1, 2002, Departments and agencies (except the Department of Defense) have been operating under continuing resolutions, and, as such, have been spending these balances to maintain current operations.
<br>
<br>Authority to reallocate unexpended funds of agencies transferred under this Plan is found in H.J. Res. 124 [Pub. L. 107–294, Nov. 23, 2002, 116 Stat. 2062], the continuing resolution in effect currently and until January 11, 2003. The resolution provides authority for the Office of Management and Budget to transfer an amount not to exceed $140,000,000 from unobligated balances of appropriations enacted before October 1, 2002 "for organizations and entities that will be transferred to the new Department and for salaries and expenses associated with the initiation of the Department." Such authority may be exercised upon providing 15 days' notice to the Appropriations Committees. We anticipate that it may be necessary to provide funding through such transfers both for transferring entities and for salaries and expenses associated with the initiation of the Department, including, for example, those associated with establishing the Office of the Secretary and other new offices provided for in the Act. Any plan to use such funding will follow the procedures required under the continuing resolution, including the provision of at least 15 days' notice to the Appropriations Committees.
<br>
<br>(5) Specification of any proposed disposition of property, facilities, contracts, records, and other assets and obligations of agencies transferred under the plan.
<br>
<br>• There is no intention to dispose of property, facility, contracts, records, and other assets and obligations of agencies transferred under the plan. All of such assets and obligations will transfer with each agency pursuant to Section 1511(d)(1) of the Act [6 U.S.C. 551(d)(1)].
<br>
<br>• Prior to and during the transition period (as defined by Section 1501(a)(2) of the Act [6 U.S.C. 541(a)(2)]), the Department may identify property, facilities, contracts, records, and other assets and obligations of agencies transferred that would be candidates for disposition due to duplication, non-use, obsolescence, and the like. If and when any such proposed dispositions are identified, we will follow provisions of the Act relating to modification of this plan or further notification of Congress.
<br>
<br>(6) Specification of the proposed allocations within the Department of the functions of the agencies and subdivisions that are not related directly to securing the homeland.
<br>
<br>• As agencies and subdivisions are transferred into the Department, any functions of those entities that are not directly related to securing the homeland will continue to be allocated to the agencies and subdivisions in which they are currently incorporated.

<br>January 30, 2003
<br>H. Doc. No. 108–32, 108th Congress, 1st Session, provided:
<br>Introduction
<br>
<br>This Reorganization Plan Modification is submitted pursuant to the Homeland Security Act ("the Act") of 2002 [Pub. L. 107–296, Nov. 25, 2002, 116 Stat. 2135]. All elements of the Department of Homeland Security Reorganization Plan of November 25, 2002 ("the Plan") [set out above] remain as submitted except for those modifications addressed herein.
<br>Purpose of Modification
<br>
<br>This modification of the Plan is to establish and specify organizational units within the Border and Transportation Security Directorate. This modification presents a structural change, but does not consolidate, discontinue, or diminish transferred agencies' current operations in the field.
<br>Plan Modifications
<br>
<br>(a) Rename the "Bureau of Border Security" the "Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement." As required by the Act, this Bureau will be headed by an Assistant Secretary who will report directly to the Undersecretary for Border and Transportation Security.
<br>
<br>This Bureau will comprise Immigration Naturalization Service (INS) interior enforcement functions, including the detention and removal program, the intelligence program, and the investigations program. At the same time, pursuant to this modification, the interior enforcement resources and missions of the Customs Service and the Federal Protective Service will be added to this Bureau. The mission of the Bureau is:
<br>
<br>1. To enforce the full range of immigration and customs laws within the interior of the United States; and,
<br>
<br>2. To protect specified federal buildings.
<br>
<br>The Assistant Secretary will:
<br>
<br>1. Establish and oversee the administration of the policies for performing the detention and removal program, the intelligence program, and the investigation program functions as are—
<br>
<br>(a) transferred to the Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security by Section 441 of the Act [6 U.S.C. 251] and delegated to the Assistant Secretary by the Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security; or
<br>
<br>(b) otherwise vested in the Assistant Secretary by law.
<br>
<br>2. Advise the Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security with respect to any policy or operation of the Bureau that may affect the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services established under subtitle E of the Act [probably means subtitle E of title IV of the Act, 6 U.S.C. 271 et seq.], including potentially conflicting policies and operations.
<br>
<br>(b) Rename the "Customs Service" the "Bureau of Customs and Border Protection." This Bureau will be headed by the Commissioner of Customs and will report to the Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security.
<br>
<br>The Bureau will contain the resources and missions relating to borders and ports of entry of the Customs Service, the INS, including the Border Patrol and the inspections program, and the agricultural inspections function of the Agricultural Quarantine Inspection program.
<br>
<br>The Commissioner will:
<br>
<br>1. Establish and oversee the administration of the policies for performing the Border Patrol and inspections program functions as are—
<br>
<br>(a) transferred to the Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security by Section 441 of the Act [6 U.S.C. 251] and delegated to the Commissioner by the Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security; or
<br>
<br>(b) otherwise vested in the Assistant Secretary [probably should be "Commissioner"] by law.
<br>
<br>2. Advise the Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security with respect to any policy or operation of the Bureau that may affect the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services established under subtitle E of the Act [probably means subtitle E of title IV of the Act, 6 U.S.C. 271 et seq.], including potentially conflicting policies and operations.
<br>Implementation Date
<br>
<br>March 1, 2003
<br>Elements Required by the Act To Be Submitted With Modified Plan
<br>
<br>(1) Identification of any functions of agencies transferred to the Department pursuant to this Act that will not be transferred to the Department under the plan.
<br>
<br>None.
<br>
<br>(2) Specification of the steps to be taken by the Secretary to organize the Department, including the delegation or assignment of functions transferred to the Department among officers of the Department in order to permit the Department to carry out the functions transferred under the plan.
<br>
<br>See plan modifications above.
<br>
<br>(3) Specification of the funds available to each agency that will be transferred to the Department as a result of transfers under the plan.
<br>
<br>The table attached at Tab A [not set out in the Code] provides estimates of the funds available to the agencies affected by this modification that will be transferred to the Department by operation of the Act. The table includes total funding (mandatory and discretionary including fees) and discretionary funding net of fees. The table provides the President's requested levels for 2003.
<br>
<br>Because of the current state of the 2003 budget process, information concerning the funds that will be available to each transferring agency on the date of the proposed transfers is not currently available. As additional information becomes available, it will be provided as may be required in accordance with the procedures under the Act for modification of this Plan or other applicable law.
<br>
<br>(4) Specification of the proposed allocations within the Department of unexpended funds transferred in connection with transfers under the plan.
<br>
<br>The table attached at Tab B [not set out in the Code] provides updated estimates of the unobligated balances as of September 30, 2002, for the agencies affected by this modification that will be transferred to the Department. Since October 1, 2002, these agencies have been operating under continuing resolutions, and, as such, have been spending these balances to maintain current operations. As additional information becomes available, it will be provided as may be required in accordance with the procedures under the Act for modification of this Plan or other applicable law.
<br>
<br>(5) Specification of any proposed disposition of property, facilities, contracts, records, and other assets and obligations of agencies transferred under the plan.
<br>
<br>There is no intention to dispose of property, facilities, contracts, records, and other assets and obligations of agencies transferred under this modification. All such assets and obligations will transfer with each agency pursuant to Section 1511(d)(1) of the Act [6 U.S.C. 551(d)(1)].
<br>
<br>(6) Specification of the proposed allocations within the Department of the functions of the agencies and subdivisions that are not related directly to securing the homeland.
<br>
<br>The functions of the agencies affected by this modification that are not directly related to securing the homeland will continue to be performed by the bureaus formed by this planned reorganization.
