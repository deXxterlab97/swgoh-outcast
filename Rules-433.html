<br>(B) Stringency
<br>
<br>If the appropriate Federal banking agency or the Corporation determines that the application of any generally accepted accounting principle to any insured depository institution is inconsistent with the objectives described in paragraph (1), the agency or the Corporation may, with respect to reports or statements required to be filed with such agency or Corporation, prescribe an accounting principle which is applicable to such institutions which is no less stringent than generally accepted accounting principles.

<br>(B) Modification of noncomplying measures
<br>
<br>Modify or eliminate any accounting principle or reporting requirement of such Federal agency which the agency determines fails to comply with the objectives and standards established under paragraphs (1) and (2).
<br>(C) Inclusion of "off balance sheet" items
<br>
<br>Develop and prescribe regulations which require that all assets and liabilities, including contingent assets and liabilities, of insured depository institutions be reported in, or otherwise taken into account in the preparation of any balance sheet, financial statement, report of condition, or other report of such institution, required to be filed with a Federal banking agency.
<br>(b) Uniform accounting of capital standards
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Each appropriate Federal banking agency shall maintain uniform accounting standards to be used for determining compliance with statutory or regulatory requirements of depository institutions.
<br>(2) Transition provision
<br>
<br>Any standards in effect on December 19, 1991, under section 1833d 1 of this title shall continue in effect after December 19, 1991, until amended by the appropriate Federal banking agency under paragraph (1).
<br>(c) Reports to banking committees

<br>
<br>The Federal banking agencies shall jointly submit an annual report to the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate containing a description of any difference between any accounting or capital standard used by any such agency and any accounting or capital standard used by any other agency.
<br>(2) Explanation of reasons for discrepancy
<br>
<br>Each report submitted under paragraph (1) shall contain an explanation of the reasons for any discrepancy between any accounting or capital standard used by any such agency and any accounting or capital standard used by any other agency.

<br>
<br>(iii) prepare and submit a written report to the appropriate Federal banking agency and to Congress on the results of any determination by the Inspector General, including—
<br>
<br>(I) an identification of any loss that warrants an in-depth review, together with the reasons why such review is warranted, or, if the Inspector General determines that no review is warranted, an explanation of such determination; and
<br>
<br>(II) for each loss identified under subclause (I) that warrants an in-depth review, the date by which such review, and a report on such review prepared in a manner consistent with reports under paragraph (1)(A), will be completed and submitted to the Federal banking agency and Congress.
