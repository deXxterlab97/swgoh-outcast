<br>§1843. Limitations and conditions of loan guarantees
<br>(a) Necessary findings
<br>
<br>A guarantee of a loan may be made under this chapter only if—
<br>
<br>(1) the Board finds that (A) the loan is needed to enable the borrower to continue to furnish goods or services and failure to meet this need would adversely and seriously affect the economy of or employment in the Nation or any region thereof, (B) credit is not otherwise available to the borrower under reasonable terms or conditions, and (C) the prospective earning power of the borrower, together with the character and value of the security pledged, furnish reasonable assurance that it will be able to repay the loan within the time fixed, and afford reasonable protection to the United States; and
<br>
<br>(2) the lender certifies that it would not make the loan without such guarantee.
<br>(b) Term of loans; renewal
<br>
<br>Loans guaranteed under this chapter shall be payable in not more than five years, but may be renewable for not more than an additional three years.
<br>(c) Interest rates, determination; guarantee fee
<br>
<br>(1) Loans guaranteed under this chapter shall bear interest payable to the lending institutions at rates determined by the Board taking into account the reduction in risk afforded by the loan guarantee and rates charged by lending institutions on otherwise comparable loans.
<br>
<br>(2) The Board shall prescribe and collect a guarantee fee in connection with each loan guaranteed under this chapter. Such fee shall reflect the Government's administrative expense in making the guarantee and the risk assumed by the Government and shall not be less than an amount which, when added to the amount of interest payable to the lender of such loan, produces a total charge appropriate for loan agreements of comparable risk and maturity if supplied by the normal capital markets.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 92–70, §4, Aug. 9, 1971, 85 Stat. 178.)
<br>§1844. Security for loan guarantees
<br>
<br>In negotiating a loan guarantee under this chapter, the Board shall make every effort to arrange that the payment of the principal of and interest on any plan guaranteed shall be secured by sufficient property of the enterprise to collateralize fully the amount of the loan guarantee.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 92–70, §5, Aug. 9, 1971, 85 Stat. 179.)
<br>§1845. Requirements applicable to loan guarantees
<br>(a) Stock dividends or other payments, prohibition; waiver
<br>
<br>A guarantee agreement made under this chapter with respect to an enterprise shall require that while there is any principal or interest remaining unpaid on a guaranteed loan to that enterprise the enterprise may not—
<br>
<br>(1) declare a dividend on its common stock; or
<br>
<br>(2) make any payment on its other indebtedness to a lender whose loan has been guaranteed under this chapter.
<br>
<br>The Board may waive either or both of the requirements set forth in this subsection, as specified in the guarantee agreement covering a loan to any particular enterprise, if it determines that such waiver is not inconsistent with the reasonable protection of the interests of the United States under the guarantee.
<br>(b) Managerial changes
<br>
<br>If the Board determines that the inability of an enterprise to obtain credit without a guarantee under this chapter is the result of a failure on the part of management to exercise reasonable business prudence in the conduct of the affairs of the enterprise, the Board shall require before guaranteeing any loan to the enterprise that the enterprise make such management changes as the Board deems necessary to give the enterprise a sound managerial base.
<br>(c) Financial statement; access to documents
<br>
<br>A guarantee of a loan to any enterprise shall not be made under this chapter unless—
<br>
<br>(1) the Board has received an audited financial statement of the enterprise; and
<br>
<br>(2) the enterprise permits the Board to have the same access to its books and other documents as the Board would have under section 1846 of this title in the event the loan is guaranteed.
<br>(d) Exhaustion of remedies
<br>
<br>No payment shall be made or become due under a guarantee entered into under this chapter unless the lender has exhausted any remedies which it may have under the guarantee agreement.
<br>(e) Protective provisions; advances
<br>
<br>(1) Prior to making any guarantee under this chapter, the Board shall satisfy itself that the underlying loan agreement on which the guarantee is sought contains all the affirmative and negative covenants and other protective provisions which are usual and customary in loan agreements of a similar kind, including previous loan agreements between the lender and the borrower, and that it cannot be amended, or any provisions waived, without the Board's prior consent.
<br>
<br>(2) On each occasion when the borrower seeks an advance under the loan agreement, the guarantee authorized by this chapter shall be in force as to the funds advanced only if—
<br>
<br>(A) the lender gives the Board at least ten days' notice in writing of its intent to provide the borrower with funds pursuant to the loan agreement;
<br>
<br>(B) the lender certifies to the Board before an advance is made that, as of the date of the notice provided for in subparagraph (A), the borrower is not in default under the loan agreement: Provided, That if a default has occurred the lender shall report the facts and circumstances relating thereto to the Board and the Board may expressly and in writing waive such default in any case where it determines that such waiver is not inconsistent with the reasonable protection of the interests of the United States under the guarantee; and
<br>
<br>(C) the borrower provides the Board with a plan setting forth the expenditures for which the advance will be used and the period during which the expenditures will be made, and, upon the expiration of such periods, reports to the Board any instances in which amounts advanced have not been expended in accordance with the plan.
<br>(f) Loan security, priority; collateral
<br>
<br>(1) A guarantee agreement made under this chapter shall contain a requirement that as between the Board and the lender, the Board shall have a priority with respect to, and to the extent of, the lender's interest in any collateral securing the loan and any earlier outstanding loans. The Board shall take all steps necessary to assure such priority against any other persons.
<br>
<br>(2) As used in paragraph (1) of this subsection, the term "collateral" includes all assets pledged under loan agreements and, if appropriate in the opinion of the Board, all sums of the borrower on deposit with the lender and subject to offset under section 68 of the Bankruptcy Act.

<br>§2051. Congressional findings and declaration of purpose
<br>
<br>(a) The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) an unacceptable number of consumer products which present unreasonable risks of injury are distributed in commerce;
<br>
<br>(2) complexities of consumer products and the diverse nature and abilities of consumers using them frequently result in an inability of users to anticipate risks and to safeguard themselves adequately;
<br>
<br>(3) the public should be protected against unreasonable risks of injury associated with consumer products;
<br>
<br>(4) control by State and local governments of unreasonable risks of injury associated with consumer products is inadequate and may be burdensome to manufacturers;
<br>
<br>(5) existing Federal authority to protect consumers from exposure to consumer products presenting unreasonable risks of injury is inadequate; and
<br>
<br>(6) regulation of consumer products the distribution or use of which affects interstate or foreign commerce is necessary to carry out this chapter.
<br>
<br>(b) The purposes of this chapter are—
<br>
<br>(1) to protect the public against unreasonable risks of injury associated with consumer products;
<br>
<br>(2) to assist consumers in evaluating the comparative safety of consumer products;
<br>
<br>(3) to develop uniform safety standards for consumer products and to minimize conflicting State and local regulations; and
<br>
<br>(4) to promote research and investigation into the causes and prevention of product-related deaths, illnesses, and injuries.

<br>§2053. Consumer Product Safety Commission
<br>(a) Establishment; Chairman
<br>
<br>An independent regulatory commission is hereby established, to be known as the Consumer Product Safety Commission, consisting of five Commissioners who shall be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. In making such appointments, the President shall consider individuals who, by reason of their background and expertise in areas related to consumer products and protection of the public from risks to safety, are qualified to serve as members of the Commission. The Chairman shall be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, from among the members of the Commission. An individual may be appointed as a member of the Commission and as Chairman at the same time. Any member of the Commission may be removed by the President for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office but for no other cause.
<br>(b) Term; vacancies
<br>
<br>(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), (A) the Commissioners first appointed under this section shall be appointed for terms ending three, four, five, six, and seven years, respectively, after October 27, 1972, the term of each to be designated by the President at the time of nomination; and (B) each of their successors shall be appointed for a term of seven years from the date of the expiration of the term for which his predecessor was appointed.

<br>(c) Restrictions on Commissioner's outside activities
<br>
<br>Not more than three of the Commissioners shall be affiliated with the same political party. No individual (1) in the employ of, or holding any official relation to, any person engaged in selling or manufacturing consumer products, or (2) owning stock or bonds of substantial value in a person so engaged, or (3) who is in any other manner pecuniarily interested in such a person, or in a substantial supplier of such a person, shall hold the office of Commissioner. A Commissioner may not engage in any other business, vocation, or employment.
<br>(d) Quorum; seal; Vice Chairman

<br>No vacancy in the Commission shall impair the right of the remaining Commissioners to exercise all the powers of the Commission, but three members of the Commission shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, except that if there are only three members serving on the Commission because of vacancies in the Commission, two members of the Commission shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and if there are only two members serving on the Commission because of vacancies in the Commission, two members shall constitute a quorum for the six month period beginning on the date of the vacancy which caused the number of Commission members to decline to two. The Commission shall have an official seal of which judicial notice shall be taken.

<br>
<br>(2) In carrying out any of his functions under the provisions of this subsection the Chairman shall be governed by general policies of the Commission and by such regulatory decisions, findings, and determinations as the Commission may by law be authorized to make.
<br>
<br>(3) Requests or estimates for regular, supplemental, or deficiency appropriations on behalf of the Commission may not be submitted by the Chairman without the prior approval of the Commission.

<br>
<br>(B)(i) No individual may be appointed to such a position on an acting basis for a period longer than 90 days unless such appointment is approved by the Commission.
<br>
<br>(ii) The Chairman, with the approval of the Commission, may remove any individual serving in a position appointed under subparagraph (A).
<br>
<br>(C) Subparagraph (A) shall not be construed to prohibit appropriate reorganizations or changes in classification.
<br>
<br>(2) The Chairman, subject to subsection (f)(2), may employ such other officers and employees (including attorneys) as are necessary in the execution of the Commission's functions.
<br>
<br>(3) In addition to the number of positions authorized by section 5108(a) of title 5, the Chairman, subject to the approval of the Commission, and subject to the standards and procedures prescribed by chapter 51 of title 5, may place a total of twelve positions in grades GS–16, GS–17, and GS–18.

<br>(h) Omitted
<br>(i) Civil action against United States
<br>
<br>Subsections (a) and (h) of section 2680 of title 28 do not prohibit the bringing of a civil action on a claim against the United States which—

<br>(1) is based upon—
<br>
<br>(A) misrepresentation or deceit on the part of the Commission or any employee thereof, or
<br>
<br>(B) any exercise or performance, or failure to exercise or perform, a discretionary function on the part of the Commission or any employee thereof, which exercise, performance, or failure was grossly negligent; and
<br>
<br>(2) is not made with respect to any agency action (as defined in section 551(13) of title 5).
<br>
<br>In the case of a civil action on a claim based upon the exercise or performance of, or failure to exercise or perform, a discretionary function, no judgment may be entered against the United States unless the court in which such action was brought determines (based upon consideration of all the relevant circumstances, including the statutory responsibility of the Commission and the public interest in encouraging rather than inhibiting the exercise of discretion) that such exercise, performance, or failure to exercise or perform was unreasonable.
<br>(j) Agenda and priorities; establishment and comments
<br>
<br>At least 30 days before the beginning of each fiscal year, the Commission shall establish an agenda for Commission action under the Acts under its jurisdiction and, to the extent feasible, shall establish priorities for such actions. Before establishing such agenda and priorities, the Commission shall conduct a public hearing on the agenda and priorities and shall provide reasonable opportunity for the submission of comments.

<br>"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.
<br>
<br>"(a) Short Title.—This Act may be cited as the 'Fire Safe Cigarette Act of 1990'.
<br>
<br>"(b) Findings.—The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>"(1) cigarette-ignited fires are the leading cause of fire deaths in the United States,
<br>
<br>"(2) in 1987, there were 1,492 deaths from cigarette-ignited fires, 3,809 serious injuries, and $395,000,000 in property damage caused by such fires,
<br>
<br>"(3) the final report of the Technical Study Group on Cigarette and Little Cigar Fire Safety under the Cigarette Safety Act of 1984 [set out below] determined that (A) it is technically feasible and may be commercially feasible to develop a cigarette that will have a significantly reduced propensity to ignite furniture and mattresses, and (B) the overall impact on other aspects of the United States society and economy may be minimal,
<br>
<br>"(4) the final report of the Technical Study Group on Cigarette and Little Cigar Fire Safety under the Cigarette Safety Act of 1984 further determined that the value of a cigarette with less of a likelihood to ignite furniture and mattresses which would prevent property damage and personal injury and loss of life is economically incalculable,
<br>
<br>"(5) it is appropriate for the Congress to require by law the completion of the research described in the final report of the Technical Study Group on Cigarette and Little Cigar Fire Safety and an assessment of the practicability of developing a performance standard to reduce cigarette ignition propensity, and
<br>
<br>"(6) it is appropriate for the Consumer Product Safety Commission to utilize its expertise to complete the recommendations for further work and report to Congress in a timely fashion.
