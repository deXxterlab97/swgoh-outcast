<br>SUBCHAPTER IX—MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT PREVENTION
<br>§12611. Motor vehicle theft prevention program
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>Not later than 180 days after September 13, 1994, the Attorney General shall develop, in cooperation with the States, a national voluntary motor vehicle theft prevention program (in this section referred to as the "program") under which—
<br>
<br>(1) the owner of a motor vehicle may voluntarily sign a consent form with a participating State or locality in which the motor vehicle owner—
<br>
<br>(A) states that the vehicle is not normally operated under certain specified conditions; and
<br>
<br>(B) agrees to—
<br>
<br>(i) display program decals or devices on the owner's vehicle; and
<br>
<br>(ii) permit law enforcement officials in any State to stop the motor vehicle and take reasonable steps to determine whether the vehicle is being operated by or with the permission of the owner, if the vehicle is being operated under the specified conditions; and
<br>
<br>(2) participating States and localities authorize law enforcement officials in the State or locality to stop motor vehicles displaying program decals or devices under specified conditions and take reasonable steps to determine whether the vehicle is being operated by or with the permission of the owner.
<br>(b) Uniform decal or device designs
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The motor vehicle theft prevention program developed pursuant to this section shall include a uniform design or designs for decals or other devices to be displayed by motor vehicles participating in the program.
<br>(2) Type of design
<br>
<br>The uniform design shall—
<br>
<br>(A) be highly visible; and
<br>
<br>(B) explicitly state that the motor vehicle to which it is affixed may be stopped under the specified conditions without additional grounds for establishing a reasonable suspicion that the vehicle is being operated unlawfully.
<br>(c) Voluntary consent form
<br>
<br>The voluntary consent form used to enroll in the program shall—
<br>
<br>(1) clearly state that participation in the program is voluntary;
<br>
<br>(2) clearly explain that participation in the program means that, if the participating vehicle is being operated under the specified conditions, law enforcement officials may stop the vehicle and take reasonable steps to determine whether it is being operated by or with the consent of the owner, even if the law enforcement officials have no other basis for believing that the vehicle is being operated unlawfully;
<br>
<br>(3) include an express statement that the vehicle is not normally operated under the specified conditions and that the operation of the vehicle under those conditions would provide sufficient grounds for a prudent law enforcement officer to reasonably believe that the vehicle was not being operated by or with the consent of the owner; and
<br>
<br>(4) include any additional information that the Attorney General may reasonably require.
<br>(d) Specified conditions under which stops may be authorized
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Attorney General shall promulgate rules establishing the conditions under which participating motor vehicles may be authorized to be stopped under this section. These conditions may not be based on race, creed, color, national origin, gender, or age. These conditions may include—
<br>
<br>(A) the operation of the vehicle during certain hours of the day; or
<br>
<br>(B) the operation of the vehicle under other circumstances that would provide a sufficient basis for establishing a reasonable suspicion that the vehicle was not being operated by the owner, or with the consent of the owner.
<br>(2) More than one set of conditions
<br>
<br>The Attorney General may establish more than one set of conditions under which participating motor vehicles may be stopped. If more than one set of conditions is established, a separate consent form and a separate design for program decals or devices shall be established for each set of conditions. The Attorney General may choose to satisfy the requirement of a separate design for program decals or devices under this paragraph by the use of a design color that is clearly distinguishable from other design colors.
<br>(3) No new conditions without consent
<br>
<br>After the program has begun, the conditions under which a vehicle may be stopped if affixed with a certain decal or device design may not be expanded without the consent of the owner.
<br>(4) Limited participation by States and localities
<br>
<br>A State or locality need not authorize the stopping of motor vehicles under all sets of conditions specified under the program in order to participate in the program.
<br>(e) Motor vehicles for hire
<br>(1) Notification to lessees
<br>
<br>Any person who is in the business of renting or leasing motor vehicles and who rents or leases a motor vehicle on which a program decal or device is affixed shall, prior to transferring possession of the vehicle, notify the person to whom the motor vehicle is rented or leased about the program.
<br>(2) Type of notice
<br>
<br>The notice required by this subsection shall—
<br>
<br>(A) be in writing;
<br>
<br>(B) be in a prominent format to be determined by the Attorney General; and
<br>
<br>(C) explain the possibility that if the motor vehicle is operated under the specified conditions, the vehicle may be stopped by law enforcement officials even if the officials have no other basis for believing that the vehicle is being operated unlawfully.
<br>(3) Fine for failure to provide notice
<br>
<br>Failure to provide proper notice under this subsection shall be punishable by a fine not to exceed $5,000.
<br>(f) Notification of police
<br>
<br>As a condition of participating in the program, a State or locality must agree to take reasonable steps to ensure that law enforcement officials throughout the State or locality are familiar with the program, and with the conditions under which motor vehicles may be stopped under the program.
<br>(g) Regulations
<br>
<br>The Attorney General shall promulgate regulations to implement this section.
<br>(h) Authorization of appropriations
<br>
<br>There are authorized to carry out this section.1
<br>
<br>(1) $1,500,000 for fiscal year 1996;
<br>
<br>(2) $1,700,000 for fiscal year 1997; and
<br>
<br>(3) $1,800,000 for fiscal year 1998.

<br>
<br>Not later than 180 days after March 23, 2018, the Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and leading research, advocacy, self-advocacy, and service organizations, shall establish standards and best practices relating to the use of non-invasive and non-permanent tracking technology, where a guardian or parent has determined that a non-invasive and non-permanent tracking device is the least restrictive alternative, to locate individuals as described in subsection (a)(2) of section 12621 of this title, as added by this Act.
<br>(2) Requirements
<br>
<br>In establishing the standards and best practices required under paragraph (1), the Attorney General shall—
<br>
<br>(A) determine—
<br>
<br>(i) the criteria used to determine which individuals would benefit from the use of a tracking device;

<br>(B) establish standards and best practices the Attorney General determines are necessary to the administration of a tracking system, including procedures to—
<br>
<br>(i) safeguard the privacy of the data used by the tracking device such that—
<br>
<br>(I) access to the data is restricted to law enforcement and health agencies determined necessary by the Attorney General; and
<br>
<br>(II) collection, use, and retention of the data is solely for the purpose of preventing injury to or death of the individual wearing the tracking device;
<br>
<br>(ii) establish criteria to determine whether use of the tracking device is the least restrictive alternative in order to prevent risk of injury or death before issuing the tracking device, including the previous consideration of less restrictive alternatives;
<br>
<br>(iii) provide training for law enforcement agencies to recognize signs of abuse during interactions with applicants for tracking devices;
<br>
<br>(iv) protect the civil rights and liberties of the individuals who use tracking devices, including their rights under the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.);
<br>
<br>(v) establish a complaint and investigation process to address—
<br>
<br>(I) incidents of noncompliance by recipients of grants under subsection (a)(2) of section 12621 of this title, as added by this Act, with the best practices established by the Attorney General or other applicable law; and
<br>
<br>(II) use of a tracking device over the objection of an individual; and
<br>
<br>(vi) determine the role that State agencies should have in the administration of a tracking system.
<br>(3) Effective date
<br>
<br>The standards and best practices established pursuant to paragraph (1) shall take effect 90 days after publication of such standards and practices by the Attorney General.
<br>(b) Required compliance
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Each entity that receives a grant under subsection (a)(2) of section 12621 of this title, as added by this Act, shall comply with any standards and best practices relating to the use of tracking devices established by the Attorney General in accordance with subsection (a).
<br>(2) Determination of compliance

<br>The Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall determine whether an entity that receives a grant under subsection (a)(2) of section 12621 of this title, as added by this Act, acts in compliance with the standards and best practices described in paragraph (1).
<br>(c) Applicability of standards and best practices
<br>
<br>The standards and best practices established by the Attorney General under subsection (a) shall apply only to the grant programs authorized under subsection (a)(2) of section 12621 of this title, as added by this Act.
<br>(d) Limitations on program
<br>(1) Data storage
<br>
<br>Any tracking data provided by tracking devices issued under this program may not be used by a Federal entity to create a database.
<br>(2) Voluntary participation
<br>
<br>Nothing in this Act may be construed to require that a parent or guardian use a tracking device to monitor the location of a child or adult under that parent or guardian's supervision if the parent or guardian does not believe that the use of such device is necessary or in the interest of the child or adult under supervision.
