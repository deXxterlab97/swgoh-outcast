<br>
<br>Paragraph (1) shall not apply to a plan year if such year is in a funding plan adoption period or funding improvement period by reason of the plan being in endangered status for a preceding plan year. For purposes of this section, such preceding plan year shall be the initial determination year with respect to the funding improvement plan to which it relates.
<br>(3) Funding improvement plan
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section—
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>A funding improvement plan is a plan which consists of the actions, including options or a range of options to be proposed to the bargaining parties, formulated to provide, based on reasonably anticipated experience and reasonable actuarial assumptions, for the attainment by the plan during the funding improvement period of the following requirements:
<br>(i) Increase in plan's funding percentage
<br>
<br>The plan's funded percentage as of the close of the funding improvement period equals or exceeds a percentage equal to the sum of—
<br>
<br>(I) such percentage as of the beginning of the first plan year for which the plan is certified to be in endangered status pursuant to paragraph (b)(3), plus
<br>
<br>(II) 33 percent of the difference between 100 percent and the percentage under subclause (I).
<br>(ii) Avoidance of accumulated funding deficiencies
<br>
<br>No accumulated funding deficiency for the last plan year during the funding improvement period (taking into account any extension of amortization periods under section 1084(d) of this title).
<br>(B) Seriously endangered plans
<br>
<br>In the case of a plan in seriously endangered status, except as provided in paragraph (5), subparagraph (A)(i)(II) shall be applied by substituting "20 percent" for "33 percent".
<br>(4) Funding improvement period
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section—
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The funding improvement period for any funding improvement plan adopted pursuant to this subsection is the 10-year period beginning on the first day of the first plan year of the multiemployer plan beginning after the earlier of—
<br>
<br>(i) the second anniversary of the date of the adoption of the funding improvement plan, or
<br>
<br>(ii) the expiration of the collective bargaining agreements in effect on the due date for the actuarial certification of endangered status for the initial determination year under subsection (b)(3)(A) and covering, as of such due date, at least 75 percent of the active participants in such multiemployer plan.
<br>(B) Seriously endangered plans
<br>
<br>In the case of a plan in seriously endangered status, except as provided in paragraph (5), subparagraph (A) shall be applied by substituting "15-year period" for "10-year period".
<br>(C) Coordination with changes in status
<br>(i) Plans no longer in endangered status
<br>
<br>If the plan's actuary certifies under subsection (b)(3)(A) for a plan year in any funding plan adoption period or funding improvement period that the plan is no longer in endangered status and is not in critical status, the funding plan adoption period or funding improvement period, whichever is applicable, shall end as of the close of the preceding plan year.
<br>(ii) Plans in critical status
<br>
<br>If the plan's actuary certifies under subsection (b)(3)(A) for a plan year in any funding plan adoption period or funding improvement period that the plan is in critical status, the funding plan adoption period or funding improvement period, whichever is applicable, shall end as of the close of the plan year preceding the first plan year in the rehabilitation period with respect to such status.
<br>(D) Plans in endangered status at end of period
<br>
<br>If the plan's actuary certifies under subsection (b)(3)(A) for the first plan year following the close of the period described in subparagraph (A) that the plan is in endangered status, the provisions of this subsection and subsection (d) shall be applied as if such first plan year were an initial determination year, except that the plan may not be amended in a manner inconsistent with the funding improvement plan in effect for the preceding plan year until a new funding improvement plan is adopted.
<br>(5) Special rules for seriously endangered plans more than 70 percent funded
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>If the funded percentage of a plan in seriously endangered status was more than 70 percent as of the beginning of the initial determination year—
<br>
<br>(i) paragraphs (3)(B) and (4)(B) shall apply only if the plan's actuary certifies, within 30 days after the certification under subsection (b)(3)(A) for the initial determination year, that, based on the terms of the plan and the collective bargaining agreements in effect at the time of such certification, the plan is not projected to meet the requirements of paragraph (3)(A) (without regard to paragraphs (3)(B) and (4)(B)), and
<br>
<br>(ii) if there is a certification under clause (i), the plan may, in formulating its funding improvement plan, only take into account the rules of paragraph 4 (3)(B) and (4)(B) for plan years in the funding improvement period beginning on or before the date on which the last of the collective bargaining agreements described in paragraph (4)(A)(ii) expires.
<br>(B) Special rule after expiration of agreements
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding subparagraph (A)(ii), if, for any plan year ending after the date described in subparagraph (A)(ii), the plan actuary certifies (at the time of the annual certification under subsection (b)(3)(A) for such plan year) that, based on the terms of the plan and collective bargaining agreements in effect at the time of that annual certification, the plan is not projected to be able to meet the requirements of paragraph (3)(A) (without regard to paragraphs (3)(B) and (4)(B)), paragraphs (3)(B) and (4)(B) shall continue to apply for such year.
<br>(6) Updates to funding improvement plan and schedules
<br>(A) Funding improvement plan
<br>
<br>The plan sponsor shall annually update the funding improvement plan and shall file the update with the plan's annual report under section 1024 of this title.
<br>(B) Schedules
<br>
<br>The plan sponsor shall annually update any schedule of contribution rates provided under this subsection to reflect the experience of the plan.
<br>(C) Duration of schedule

<br>(A) Initial contribution schedule
<br>
<br>If—
<br>
<br>(i) a collective bargaining agreement providing for contributions under a multiemployer plan that was in effect at the time the plan entered endangered status expires, and
<br>
<br>(ii) after receiving one or more schedules from the plan sponsor under paragraph (1)(B), the bargaining parties with respect to such agreement fail to adopt a contribution schedule with terms consistent with the funding improvement plan and a schedule from the plan sponsor,
<br>
<br>the plan sponsor shall implement the schedule described in paragraph (1)(B)(i)(I) beginning on the date specified in subparagraph (C).
<br>(B) Subsequent contribution schedule
<br>
<br>If—
<br>
<br>(i) a collective bargaining agreement providing for contributions under a multiemployer plan in accordance with a schedule provided by the plan sponsor pursuant to a funding improvement plan (or imposed under subparagraph (A)) expires while the plan is still in endangered status, and
<br>
<br>(ii) after receiving one or more updated schedules from the plan sponsor under paragraph (6)(B), the bargaining parties with respect to such agreement fail to adopt a contribution schedule with terms consistent with the updated funding improvement plan and a schedule from the plan sponsor,
<br>
<br>then the contribution schedule applicable under the expired collective bargaining agreement, as updated and in effect on the date the collective bargaining agreement expires, shall be implemented by the plan sponsor beginning on the date specified in subparagraph (C).
<br>(C) Date of implementation
<br>
<br>The date specified in this subparagraph is the date which is 180 days after the date on which the collective bargaining agreement described in subparagraph (A) or (B) expires.
<br>(D) Failure to make scheduled contributions
<br>
<br>Any failure to make a contribution under a schedule of contribution rates provided under this paragraph shall be treated as a delinquent contribution under section 1145 of this title and shall be enforceable as such.
<br>(8) Funding plan adoption period
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, the term "funding plan adoption period" means the period beginning on the date of the certification under subsection (b)(3)(A) for the initial determination year and ending on the day before the first day of the funding improvement period.
<br>(d) Rules for operation of plan during adoption and improvement periods
<br>(1) Compliance with funding improvement plan
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>A plan may not be amended after the date of the adoption of a funding improvement plan under subsection (c) so as to be inconsistent with the funding improvement plan.
<br>(B) Special rules for benefit increases
<br>
<br>A plan may not be amended after the date of the adoption of a funding improvement plan under subsection (c) so as to increase benefits, including future benefit accruals, unless the plan actuary certifies that such increase is paid for out of additional contributions not contemplated by the funding improvement plan, and, after taking into account the benefit increase, the multiemployer plan still is reasonably expected to meet the applicable benchmark on the schedule contemplated in the funding improvement plan.
<br>(2) Special rules for plan adoption period
<br>
<br>During the period beginning on the date of the certification under subsection (b)(3)(A) for the initial determination year and ending on the date of the adoption of a funding improvement plan—
<br>
<br>(A) the plan sponsor may not accept a collective bargaining agreement or participation agreement with respect to the multiemployer plan that provides for—
<br>
<br>(i) a reduction in the level of contributions for any participants,
<br>
<br>(ii) a suspension of contributions with respect to any period of service, or
<br>
<br>(iii) any new direct or indirect exclusion of younger or newly hired employees from plan participation, and
<br>
<br>(B) no amendment of the plan which increases the liabilities of the plan by reason of any increase in benefits, any change in the accrual of benefits, or any change in the rate at which benefits become nonforfeitable under the plan may be adopted unless the amendment is required as a condition of qualification under part I of subchapter D of chapter 1 of title 26 or to comply with other applicable law.
<br>(e) Rehabilitation plan must be adopted for multiemployer plans in critical status
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>In any case in which a multiemployer plan is in critical status for a plan year, the plan sponsor, in accordance with this subsection—
<br>
<br>(A) shall adopt a rehabilitation plan not later than 240 days following the required date for the actuarial certification of critical status under subsection (b)(3)(A), and
<br>
<br>(B) within 30 days after the adoption of the rehabilitation plan—
<br>
<br>(i) shall provide to the bargaining parties 1 or more schedules showing revised benefit structures, revised contribution structures, or both, which, if adopted, may reasonably be expected to enable the multiemployer plan to emerge from critical status in accordance with the rehabilitation plan, and
<br>
<br>(ii) may, if the plan sponsor deems appropriate, prepare and provide the bargaining parties with additional information relating to contribution rates or benefit reductions, alternative schedules, or other information relevant to emerging from critical status in accordance with the rehabilitation plan.
<br>
<br>The schedule or schedules described in subparagraph (B)(i) shall reflect reductions in future benefit accruals and adjustable benefits, and increases in contributions, that the plan sponsor determines are reasonably necessary to emerge from critical status. One schedule shall be designated as the default schedule and such schedule shall assume that there are no increases in contributions under the plan other than the increases necessary to emerge from critical status after future benefit accruals and other benefits (other than benefits the reduction or elimination of which are not permitted under section 1054(g) of this title) have been reduced to the maximum extent permitted by law.
<br>(2) Exception for years after process begins
<br>
<br>Paragraph (1) shall not apply to a plan year if such year is in a rehabilitation plan adoption period or rehabilitation period by reason of the plan being in critical status for a preceding plan year. For purposes of this section, such preceding plan year shall be the initial critical year with respect to the rehabilitation plan to which it relates.
<br>(3) Rehabilitation plan
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section—
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>A rehabilitation plan is a plan which consists of—
<br>
<br>(i) actions, including options or a range of options to be proposed to the bargaining parties, formulated, based on reasonably anticipated experience and reasonable actuarial assumptions, to enable the plan to cease to be in critical status by the end of the rehabilitation period and may include reductions in plan expenditures (including plan mergers and consolidations), reductions in future benefit accruals or increases in contributions, if agreed to by the bargaining parties, or any combination of such actions, or
<br>
<br>(ii) if the plan sponsor determines that, based on reasonable actuarial assumptions and upon exhaustion of all reasonable measures, the plan can not reasonably be expected to emerge from critical status by the end of the rehabilitation period, reasonable measures to emerge from critical status at a later time or to forestall possible insolvency (within the meaning of section 1426 of this title).
<br>
<br>A rehabilitation plan must provide annual standards for meeting the requirements of such rehabilitation plan. Such plan shall also include the schedules required to be provided under paragraph (1)(B)(i) and if clause (ii) applies, shall set forth the alternatives considered, explain why the plan is not reasonably expected to emerge from critical status by the end of the rehabilitation period, and specify when, if ever, the plan is expected to emerge from critical status in accordance with the rehabilitation plan.
<br>(B) Updates to rehabilitation plan and schedules
<br>(i) Rehabilitation plan

<br>
<br>(II) after receiving one or more schedules from the plan sponsor under paragraph (1)(B), the bargaining parties with respect to such agreement fail to adopt a contribution schedule with terms consistent with the rehabilitation plan and a schedule from the plan sponsor under paragraph (1)(B)(i),
<br>
<br> the plan sponsor shall implement the schedule described in the last sentence of paragraph (1) beginning on the date specified in clause (iii).
<br>(ii) Subsequent contribution schedule
<br>
<br>If—
<br>
<br>(I) a collective bargaining agreement providing for contributions under a multiemployer plan in accordance with a schedule provided by the plan sponsor pursuant to a rehabilitation plan (or imposed under subparagraph (C)(i)) expires while the plan is still in critical status, and
<br>
<br>(II) after receiving one or more updated schedules from the plan sponsor under subparagraph (B)(ii), the bargaining parties with respect to such agreement fail to adopt a contribution schedule with terms consistent with the updated rehabilitation plan and a schedule from the plan sponsor,
<br>
<br> then the contribution schedule applicable under the expired collective bargaining agreement, as updated and in effect on the date the collective bargaining agreement expires, shall be implemented by the plan sponsor beginning on the date specified in clause (iii).
<br>(iii) Date of implementation
<br>
<br>The date specified in this subparagraph 5 is the date which is 180 days after the date on which the collective bargaining agreement described in clause (i) or (ii) expires.
<br>(iv) Failure to make scheduled contributions
<br>
<br>Any failure to make a contribution under a schedule of contribution rates provided under this subsection shall be treated as a delinquent contribution under section 1145 of this title and shall be enforceable as such.

<br>
<br>For purposes of this section—
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The rehabilitation period for a plan in critical status is the 10-year period beginning on the first day of the first plan year of the multiemployer plan following the earlier of—
<br>
<br>(i) the second anniversary of the date of the adoption of the rehabilitation plan, or
<br>
<br>(ii) the expiration of the collective bargaining agreements in effect on the due date for the actuarial certification of critical status for the initial critical year under subsection (a)(1) and covering, as of such date 6 at least 75 percent of the active participants in such multiemployer plan.
<br>
<br>If a plan emerges from critical status as provided under subparagraph (B) before the end of such 10-year period, the rehabilitation period shall end with the plan year preceding the plan year for which the determination under subparagraph (B) is made.
<br>(B) Emergence
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>A plan in critical status shall remain in such status until a plan year for which the plan actuary certifies, in accordance with subsection (b)(3)(A), that—
<br>
<br>(I) the plan is not described in one or more of the subparagraphs in subsection (b)(2) as of the beginning of the plan year;
<br>
<br>(II) the plan is not projected to have an accumulated funding deficiency for the plan year or any of the 9 succeeding plan years, without regard to the use of the shortfall method but taking into account any extension of amortization periods under section 1084(d)(2) of this title or section 1084 of this title (as in effect prior to the enactment of the Pension Protection Act of 2006); and
<br>
<br>(III) the plan is not projected to become insolvent within the meaning of section 1426 of this title for any of the 30 succeeding plan years.
<br>(ii) Plans with certain amortization extensions
<br>(I) Special emergence rule
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding clause (i), a plan in critical status that has an automatic extension of amortization periods under section 1084(d)(1) of this title shall no longer be in critical status if the plan actuary certifies for a plan year, in accordance with subsection (b)(3)(A), that—
<br>
<br>(aa) the plan is not projected to have an accumulated funding deficiency for the plan year or any of the 9 succeeding plan years, without regard to the use of the shortfall method but taking into account any extension of amortization periods under section 1084(d)(1) of this title; and
<br>
<br>(bb) the plan is not projected to become insolvent within the meaning of section 1426 of this title for any of the 30 succeeding plan years,
<br>
<br> regardless of whether the plan is described in one or more of the subparagraphs in subsection (b)(2) as of the beginning of the plan year.
<br>(II) Reentry into critical status
<br>
<br>A plan that emerges from critical status under subclause (I) shall not reenter critical status for any subsequent plan year unless—
<br>
<br>(aa) the plan is projected to have an accumulated funding deficiency for the plan year or any of the 9 succeeding plan years, without regard to the use of the shortfall method but taking into account any extension of amortization periods under section 1084(d) of this title; or
<br>
<br>(bb) the plan is projected to become insolvent within the meaning of section 1426 of this title for any of the 30 succeeding plan years.
<br>(5) Rehabilitation plan adoption period
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, the term "rehabilitation plan adoption period" means the period beginning on the date of the certification under subsection (b)(3)(A) for the initial critical year and ending on the day before the first day of the rehabilitation period.
<br>(6) Limitation on reduction in rates of future accruals
<br>
<br>Any reduction in the rate of future accruals under the default schedule described in the last sentence of paragraph (1) shall not reduce the rate of future accruals below—
<br>
<br>(A) a monthly benefit (payable as a single life annuity commencing at the participant's normal retirement age) equal to 1 percent of the contributions required to be made with respect to a participant, or the equivalent standard accrual rate for a participant or group of participants under the collective bargaining agreements in effect as of the first day of the initial critical year, or
<br>
<br>(B) if lower, the accrual rate under the plan on such first day.
<br>
<br>The equivalent standard accrual rate shall be determined by the plan sponsor based on the standard or average contribution base units which the plan sponsor determines to be representative for active participants and such other factors as the plan sponsor determines to be relevant. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as limiting the ability of the plan sponsor to prepare and provide the bargaining parties with alternative schedules to the default schedule that establish lower or higher accrual and contribution rates than the rates otherwise described in this paragraph.
<br>(7) Automatic employer surcharge
<br>(A) Imposition of surcharge
<br>
<br>Each employer otherwise obligated to make contributions for the initial critical year shall be obligated to pay to the plan for such year a surcharge equal to 5 percent of the contributions otherwise required under the applicable collective bargaining agreement (or other agreement pursuant to which the employer contributes). For each succeeding plan year in which the plan is in critical status for a consecutive period of years beginning with the initial critical year, the surcharge shall be 10 percent of the contributions otherwise so required.
<br>(B) Enforcement of surcharge
<br>
<br>The surcharges under subparagraph (A) shall be due and payable on the same schedule as the contributions on which the surcharges are based. Any failure to make a surcharge payment shall be treated as a delinquent contribution under section 1145 of this title and shall be enforceable as such.

<br>The surcharge under this paragraph shall cease to be effective with respect to employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement (or other agreement pursuant to which the employer contributes), beginning on the effective date of a collective bargaining agreement (or other such agreement) that includes terms consistent with a schedule presented by the plan sponsor under paragraph (1)(B)(i), as modified under subparagraph (B) of paragraph (3).
<br>(D) Surcharge not to apply until employer receives notice
<br>
<br>The surcharge under this paragraph shall not apply to an employer until 30 days after the employer has been notified by the plan sponsor that the plan is in critical status and that the surcharge is in effect.

<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any provision of a plan to the contrary, the amount of any surcharge under this paragraph shall not be the basis for any benefit accrual under the plan.
<br>(8) Benefit adjustments
<br>(A) Adjustable benefits
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding section 1054(g) of this title, the plan sponsor shall, subject to the notice requirements in subparagraph (C), make any reductions to adjustable benefits which the plan sponsor deems appropriate, based upon the outcome of collective bargaining over the schedule or schedules provided under paragraph (1)(B)(i).
<br>(ii) Exception for retirees
<br>
<br>Except in the case of adjustable benefits described in clause (iv)(III), the plan sponsor of a plan in critical status shall not reduce adjustable benefits of any participant or beneficiary whose benefit commencement date is before the date on which the plan provides notice to the participant or beneficiary under subsection (b)(3)(D) for the initial critical year.
<br>(iii) Plan sponsor flexibility
<br>
<br>The plan sponsor shall include in the schedules provided to the bargaining parties an allowance for funding the benefits of participants with respect to whom contributions are not currently required to be made, and shall reduce their benefits to the extent permitted under this subchapter and considered appropriate by the plan sponsor based on the plan's then current overall funding status.
<br>(iv) Adjustable benefit defined
<br>
<br>For purposes of this paragraph, the term "adjustable benefit" means—
<br>
<br>(I) benefits, rights, and features under the plan, including post-retirement death benefits, 60-month guarantees, disability benefits not yet in pay status, and similar benefits,
<br>
<br>(II) any early retirement benefit or retirement-type subsidy (within the meaning of section 1054(g)(2)(A) of this title) and any benefit payment option (other than the qualified joint and survivor annuity), and
<br>
<br>(III) benefit increases that would not be eligible for a guarantee under section 1322a of this title on the first day of initial critical year because the increases were adopted (or, if later, took effect) less than 60 months before such first day.
<br>(B) Normal retirement benefits protected
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subparagraph (A)(iv)(III), nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to permit a plan to reduce the level of a participant's accrued benefit payable at normal retirement age.
<br>(C) Notice requirements
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>No reduction may be made to adjustable benefits under subparagraph (A) unless notice of such reduction has been given at least 30 days before the general effective date of such reduction for all participants and beneficiaries to—
<br>
<br>(I) plan participants and beneficiaries,
<br>
<br>(II) each employer who has an obligation to contribute (within the meaning of section 1392(a) of this title) under the plan, and

<br>(ii) Content of notice
<br>
<br>The notice under clause (i) shall contain—
<br>
<br>(I) sufficient information to enable participants and beneficiaries to understand the effect of any reduction on their benefits, including an estimate (on an annual or monthly basis) of any affected adjustable benefit that a participant or beneficiary would otherwise have been eligible for as of the general effective date described in clause (i), and
<br>
<br>(II) information as to the rights and remedies of plan participants and beneficiaries as well as how to contact the Department of Labor for further information and assistance where appropriate.
<br>(iii) Form and manner
<br>
<br>Any notice under clause (i)—
<br>
<br>(I) shall be provided in a form and manner prescribed in regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary,
<br>
<br>(II) shall be written in a manner so as to be understood by the average plan participant, and
<br>
<br>(III) may be provided in written, electronic, or other appropriate form to the extent such form is reasonably accessible to persons to whom the notice is required to be provided.
<br>
<br> The Secretary of the Treasury shall in the regulations prescribed under subclause (I) establish a model notice that a plan sponsor may use to meet the requirements of this subparagraph.
<br>(9) Benefit suspensions for multiemployer plans in critical and declining status
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding section 1054(g) of this title and subject to subparagraphs (B) through (I), the plan sponsor of a plan in critical and declining status may, by plan amendment, suspend benefits which the sponsor deems appropriate.
<br>(B) Suspension of benefits
<br>(i) Suspension of benefits defined
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subsection, the term "suspension of benefits" means the temporary or permanent reduction of any current or future payment obligation of the plan to any participant or beneficiary under the plan, whether or not in pay status at the time of the suspension of benefits.
<br>(ii) Length of suspensions
<br>
<br>Any suspension of benefits made under subparagraph (A) shall remain in effect until the earlier of when the plan sponsor provides benefit improvements in accordance with subparagraph (E) or the suspension of benefits expires by its own terms.

<br>
<br>The plan shall not be liable for any benefit payments not made as a result of a suspension of benefits under this paragraph.
<br>(iv) Applicability
<br>

<br>(v) Retiree representative
<br>(I) In general
<br>
<br>In the case of a plan with 10,000 or more participants, not later than 60 days prior to the plan sponsor submitting an application to suspend benefits, the plan sponsor shall select a participant of the plan in pay status to act as a retiree representative. The retiree representative shall advocate for the interests of the retired and deferred vested participants and beneficiaries of the plan throughout the suspension approval process.
<br>(II) Reasonable expenses from plan
<br>
<br>The plan shall provide for reasonable expenses by the retiree representative, including reasonable legal and actuarial support, commensurate with the plan's size and funded status.
<br>(III) Special rule relating to fiduciary status
<br>
<br>Duties performed pursuant to subclause (I) shall not be subject to section 1104(a) of this title. The preceding sentence shall not apply to those duties associated with an application to suspend benefits pursuant to subparagraph (G) that are performed by the retiree representative who is also a plan trustee.
<br>(C) Conditions for suspensions
<br>
<br>The plan sponsor of a plan in critical and declining status for a plan year may suspend benefits only if the following conditions are met:
<br>
<br>(i) Taking into account the proposed suspensions of benefits (and, if applicable, a proposed partition of the plan under section 1413 of this title), the plan actuary certifies that the plan is projected to avoid insolvency within the meaning of section 1426 of this title, assuming the suspensions of benefits continue until the suspensions of benefits expire by their own terms or if no such expiration date is set, indefinitely.
<br>
<br>(ii) The plan sponsor determines, in a written record to be maintained throughout the period of the benefit suspension, that the plan is still projected to become insolvent unless benefits are suspended under this paragraph, although all reasonable measures to avoid insolvency have been taken (and continue to be taken during the period of the benefit suspension). In its determination, the plan sponsor may take into account factors including the following:
<br>
<br>(I) Current and past contribution levels.
<br>
<br>(II) Levels of benefit accruals (including any prior reductions in the rate of benefit accruals).
<br>
<br>(III) Prior reductions (if any) of adjustable benefits.
<br>
<br>(IV) Prior suspensions (if any) of benefits under this subsection.
<br>
<br>(V) The impact on plan solvency of the subsidies and ancillary benefits available to active participants.
<br>
<br>(VI) Compensation levels of active participants relative to employees in the participants' industry generally.
<br>
<br>(VII) Competitive and other economic factors facing contributing employers.
<br>
<br>(VIII) The impact of benefit and contribution levels on retaining active participants and bargaining groups under the plan.
<br>

<br>
<br>(X) Measures undertaken by the plan sponsor to retain or attract contributing employers.
<br>(D) Limitations on suspensions
<br>
<br>Any suspensions of benefits made by a plan sponsor pursuant to this paragraph shall be subject to the following limitations:
<br>
<br>(i) The monthly benefit of any participant or beneficiary may not be reduced below 110 percent of the monthly benefit which is guaranteed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation under section 1322a of this title on the date of the suspension.
<br>
<br>(ii)(I) In the case of a participant or beneficiary who has attained 75 years of age as of the effective date of the suspension, not more than the applicable percentage of the maximum suspendable benefits of such participant or beneficiary may be suspended under this paragraph.
<br>
<br>(II) For purposes of subclause (I), the maximum suspendable benefits of a participant or beneficiary is the portion of the benefits of such participant or beneficiary that would be suspended pursuant to this paragraph without regard to this clause;
<br>
<br>(III) For purposes of subclause (I), the applicable percentage is a percentage equal to the quotient obtained by dividing—
<br>
<br>(aa) the number of months during the period beginning with the month after the month in which occurs the effective date of the suspension and ending with the month during which the participant or beneficiary attains the age of 80, by
<br>
<br>(bb) 60 months.
<br>
<br>(iii) No benefits based on disability (as defined under the plan) may be suspended under this paragraph.
<br>
<br>(iv) Any suspensions of benefits, in the aggregate (and, if applicable, considered in combination with a partition of the plan under section 1413 of this title), shall be reasonably estimated to achieve, but not materially exceed, the level that is necessary to avoid insolvency.
<br>
<br>(v) In any case in which a suspension of benefits with respect to a plan is made in combination with a partition of the plan under section 1413 of this title, the suspension of benefits may not take effect prior to the effective date of such partition.
<br>
<br>(vi) Any suspensions of benefits shall be equitably distributed across the participant and beneficiary population, taking into account factors, with respect to participants and beneficiaries and their benefits, that may include one or more of the following:

<br>
<br>(II) Length of time in pay status.
<br>

<br>
<br>(XI) Extent to which benefits are attributed to service with an employer that failed to pay its full withdrawal liability.
<br>
<br>(vii) In the case of a plan that includes the benefits described in clause (III), benefits suspended under this paragraph shall—
<br>
<br>(I) first, be applied to the maximum extent permissible to benefits attributable to a participant's service for an employer which withdrew from the plan and failed to pay (or is delinquent with respect to paying) the full amount of its withdrawal liability under section 1381(b)(1) of this title or an agreement with the plan,
<br>
<br>(II) second, except as provided by subclause (III), be applied to all other benefits that may be suspended under this paragraph, and
<br>
<br>(III) third, be applied to benefits under a plan that are directly attributable to a participant's service with any employer which has, prior to December 16, 2014—

<br>(aa) withdrawn from the plan in a complete withdrawal under section 1383 of this title and has paid the full amount of the employer's withdrawal liability under section 1381(b)(1) of this title or an agreement with the plan, and
<br>
<br>(bb) pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, assumed liability for providing benefits to participants and beneficiaries of the plan under a separate, single-employer plan sponsored by the employer, in an amount equal to any amount of benefits for such participants and beneficiaries reduced as a result of the financial status of the plan.
<br>(E) Benefit improvements
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>The plan sponsor may, in its sole discretion, provide benefit improvements while any suspension of benefits under the plan remains in effect, except that the plan sponsor may not increase the liabilities of the plan by reason of any benefit improvement for any participant or beneficiary not in pay status by the first day of the plan year for which the benefit improvement takes effect, unless—
<br>
<br>(I) such action is accompanied by equitable benefit improvements in accordance with clause (ii) for all participants and beneficiaries whose benefit commencement dates were before the first day of the plan year for which the benefit improvement for such participant or beneficiary not in pay status took effect; and
<br>
<br>(II) the plan actuary certifies that after taking into account such benefits improvements the plan is projected to avoid insolvency indefinitely under section 1426 of this title.
<br>(ii) Equitable distribution of benefit improvements
<br>(I) Limitation
<br>
<br>The projected value of the total liabilities for benefit improvements for participants and beneficiaries not in pay status by the date of the first day of the plan year in which the benefit improvements are proposed to take effect, as determined as of such date, may not exceed the projected value of the liabilities arising from benefit improvements for participants and beneficiaries with benefit commencement dates prior to the first day of such plan year, as so determined.
<br>(II) Equitable distribution of benefits
<br>
<br>The plan sponsor shall equitably distribute any increase in total liabilities for benefit improvements in clause (i) to some or all of the participants and beneficiaries whose benefit commencement date is before the date of the first day of the plan year in which the benefit improvements are proposed to take effect, taking into account the relevant factors described in subparagraph (D)(vi) and the extent to which the benefits of the participants and beneficiaries were suspended.
<br>(iii) Special rule for resumptions of benefits only for participants in pay status
<br>
<br>The plan sponsor may increase liabilities of the plan through a resumption of benefits for participants and beneficiaries in pay status only if the plan sponsor equitably distributes the value of resumed benefits to some or all of the participants and beneficiaries in pay status, taking into account the relevant factors described in subparagraph (D)(vi).
<br>(iv) Special rule for certain benefit increases
<br>
<br>This subparagraph shall not apply to a resumption of suspended benefits or plan amendment which increases liabilities with respect to participants and beneficiaries not in pay status by the first day of the plan year in which the benefit improvements took effect which—
<br>
<br>(I) the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and the Secretary of Labor, determines to be reasonable and which provides for only de minimis increases in the liabilities of the plan, or
<br>
<br>(II) is required as a condition of qualification under part I of subchapter D of chapter 1 of subtitle A of title 26 or to comply with other applicable law, as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury.
<br>(v) Additional limitations
<br>
<br>Except for resumptions of suspended benefits described in clause (iii), the limitations on benefit improvements while a suspension of benefits is in effect under this paragraph shall be in addition to any other applicable limitations on increases in benefits imposed on a plan.
<br>(vi) Definition of benefit improvement
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subparagraph, the term "benefit improvement" means, with respect to a plan, a resumption of suspended benefits, an increase in benefits, an increase in the rate at which benefits accrue, or an increase in the rate at which benefits become nonforfeitable under the plan.

<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>The plan sponsor of a plan in critical and declining status for a plan year that seeks to suspend benefits must submit an application to the Secretary of the Treasury for approval of the suspensions of benefits. If the plan sponsor submits an application for approval of the suspensions, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and the Secretary of Labor, shall approve the application upon finding that the plan is eligible for the suspensions and has satisfied the criteria of subparagraphs (C), (D), (E), and (F).
<br>(ii) Solicitation of comments
<br>
<br>Not later than 30 days after receipt of the application under clause (i), the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and the Secretary of Labor, shall publish a notice in the Federal Register soliciting comments from contributing employers, employee organizations, and participants and beneficiaries of the plan for which an application was made and other interested parties. The application for approval of the suspension of benefits shall be published on the website of the Secretary of the Treasury.
<br>(iii) Required action; deemed approval
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and the Secretary of Labor, shall approve or deny any application for suspensions of benefits under this paragraph within 225 days after the submission of such application. An application for suspension of benefits shall be deemed approved unless, within such 225 days, the Secretary of the Treasury notifies the plan sponsor that it has failed to satisfy one or more of the criteria described in this paragraph. If the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and the Secretary of Labor, rejects a plan sponsor's application, the Secretary of the Treasury shall provide notice to the plan sponsor detailing the specific reasons for the rejection, including reference to the specific requirement not satisfied. Approval or denial by the Secretary of the Treasury of an application shall be treated as a final agency action for purposes of section 704 of title 5.
<br>(iv) Agency review
<br>
<br>In evaluating whether the plan sponsor has met the criteria specified in clause (ii) of subparagraph (C), the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and the Secretary of Labor, shall review the plan sponsor's consideration of factors under such clause.
<br>(v) Standard for accepting plan sponsor determinations
<br>
<br>In evaluating the plan sponsor's application, the Secretary of the Treasury shall accept the plan sponsor's determinations unless it concludes, in consultation with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and the Secretary of Labor, that the plan sponsor's determinations were clearly erroneous.
<br>(H) Participant ratification process
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>No suspension of benefits may take effect pursuant to this paragraph prior to a vote of the participants of the plan with respect to the suspension.
<br>(ii) Administration of vote
<br>
<br>Not later than 30 days after approval of the suspension by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and the Secretary of Labor, under subparagraph (G), the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and the Secretary of Labor, shall administer a vote of participants and beneficiaries of the plan. Except as provided in clause (v), the suspension shall go into effect following the vote unless a majority of all participants and beneficiaries of the plan vote to reject the suspension. The plan sponsor may submit a new suspension application to the Secretary of the Treasury for approval in any case in which a suspension is prohibited from taking effect pursuant to a vote under this subparagraph.
<br>(iii) Ballots
<br>
<br>The plan sponsor shall provide a ballot for the vote (subject to approval by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and the Secretary of Labor) that includes the following:
<br>
<br>(I) A statement from the plan sponsor in support of the suspension.
<br>
<br>(II) A statement in opposition to the suspension compiled from comments received pursuant to subparagraph (G)(ii).
<br>
<br>(III) A statement that the suspension has been approved by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and the Secretary of Labor.
<br>
<br>(IV) A statement that the plan sponsor has determined that the plan will become insolvent unless the suspension takes effect.
<br>
<br>(V) A statement that insolvency of the plan could result in benefits lower than benefits paid under the suspension.
<br>
<br>(VI) A statement that insolvency of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation would result in benefits lower than benefits paid in the case of plan insolvency.
<br>(iv) Communication by plan sponsor
<br>
<br>It is the sense of Congress that, depending on the size and resources of the plan and geographic distribution of the plan's participants, the plan sponsor should take such steps as may be necessary to inform participants about proposed benefit suspensions through in-person meetings, telephone or internet-based communications, mailed information, or by other means.
<br>(v) Systemically important plans
<br>(I) In general
<br>
<br>Not later than 14 days after a vote under this subparagraph rejecting a suspension, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and the Secretary of Labor, shall determine whether the plan is a systemically important plan. If the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and the Secretary of Labor, determines that the plan is a systemically important plan, not later than the end of the 90-day period beginning on the date the results of the vote are certified, the Secretary of the Treasury shall, notwithstanding such adverse vote—
<br>
<br>(aa) permit the implementation of the suspension proposed by the plan sponsor; or
<br>
<br>(bb) permit the implementation of a modification by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and the Secretary of Labor, of such suspension (so long as the plan is projected to avoid insolvency within the meaning of section 1426 of this title under such modification).
<br>(II) Recommendations
<br>

<br>(bb) Indexing
<br>
<br>For calendar years beginning after 2015, there shall be substituted for the dollar amount specified in item (aa) an amount equal to the product of such dollar amount and a fraction, the numerator of which is the contribution and benefit base (determined under section 430 of title 42) for the preceding calendar year and the denominator of which is such contribution and benefit base for calendar year 2014. If the amount otherwise determined under this item is not a multiple of $1,000,000, such amount shall be rounded to the next lowest multiple of $1,000,000.
<br>(vi) Final authorization to suspend
<br>
<br>In any case in which a suspension goes into effect following a vote pursuant to clause (ii) (or following a determination under clause (v) that the plan is a systemically important plan), the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and the Secretary of Labor, shall issue a final authorization to suspend with respect to the suspension not later than 7 days after such vote (or, in the case of a suspension that goes into effect under clause (v), at a time sufficient to allow the implementation of the suspension prior to the end of the 90-day period described in clause (v)(I)).
<br>(I) Judicial review
<br>(i) Denial of application
<br>

<br>
<br>A court shall review an action challenging a suspension of benefits under this paragraph in accordance with section 706 of title 5.
<br>(bb) Temporary injunction
<br>

<br>(iii) Restricted cause of action
<br>
<br>A participant or beneficiary affected by a benefit suspension under this paragraph shall not have a cause of action under this subchapter.
<br>(iv) Limitation on action to suspend benefits
<br>

<br>(J) Special rule for emergence from critical status
<br>
<br>A plan certified to be in critical and declining status pursuant to projections made under subsection (b)(3) for which a suspension of benefits has been made by the plan sponsor pursuant to this paragraph shall not emerge from critical status under paragraph (4)(B), until such time as—
<br>
<br>(i) the plan is no longer certified to be in critical or endangered status under paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (b), and
<br>
<br>(ii) the plan is projected to avoid insolvency under section 1426 of this title.

<br>(B) Special rules for benefit increases
<br>
<br>A plan may not be amended after the date of the adoption of a rehabilitation plan under subsection (e) so as to increase benefits, including future benefit accruals, unless the plan actuary certifies that such increase is paid for out of additional contributions not contemplated by the rehabilitation plan, and, after taking into account the benefit increase, the multiemployer plan still is reasonably expected to emerge from critical status by the end of the rehabilitation period on the schedule contemplated in the rehabilitation plan.
<br>(2) Restriction on lump sums and similar benefits
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Effective on the date the notice of certification of the plan's critical status for the initial critical year under subsection (b)(3)(D) is sent, and notwithstanding section 1054(g) of this title, the plan shall not pay—
<br>
<br>(i) any payment, in excess of the monthly amount paid under a single life annuity (plus any social security supplements described in the last sentence of section 1054(b)(1)(G) of this title), to a participant or beneficiary whose annuity starting date (as defined in section 1055(h)(2) of this title) occurs after the date such notice is sent,

<br>(B) Exception
<br>
<br>Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to a benefit which under section 1053(e) of this title may be immediately distributed without the consent of the participant or to any makeup payment in the case of a retroactive annuity starting date or any similar payment of benefits owed with respect to a prior period.
<br>(3) Special rules for plan adoption period
<br>
<br>During the period beginning on the date of the certification under subsection (b)(3)(A) for the initial critical year and ending on the date of the adoption of a rehabilitation plan—
<br>
<br>(A) the plan sponsor may not accept a collective bargaining agreement or participation agreement with respect to the multiemployer plan that provides for—
<br>
<br>(i) a reduction in the level of contributions for any participants,
<br>
<br>(ii) a suspension of contributions with respect to any period of service, or
<br>
<br>(iii) any new direct or indirect exclusion of younger or newly hired employees from plan participation, and
<br>
<br>(B) no amendment of the plan which increases the liabilities of the plan by reason of any increase in benefits, any change in the accrual of benefits, or any change in the rate at which benefits become nonforfeitable under the plan may be adopted unless the amendment is required as a condition of qualification under part I of subchapter D of chapter 1 of title 26 or to comply with other applicable law.
<br>(g) Adjustments disregarded in withdrawal liability determination
<br>(1) Benefit reduction
<br>
<br>Any benefit reductions under subsection (e)(8) or (f) or benefit reductions or suspensions while in critical and declining status under subsection (e)(9)),7 unless the withdrawal occurs more than ten years after the effective date of a benefit suspension by a plan in critical and declining status, shall be disregarded in determining a plan's unfunded vested benefits for purposes of determining an employer's withdrawal liability under section 1381 of this title.
<br>(2) Surcharges
<br>
<br>Any surcharges under subsection (e)(7) shall be disregarded in determining the allocation of unfunded vested benefits to an employer under section 1391 of this title and in determining the highest contribution rate under section 1399(c) of this title, except for purposes of determining the unfunded vested benefits attributable to an employer under section 1391(c)(4) of this title or a comparable method approved under section 1391(c)(5) of this title.
<br>(3) Contribution increases required by funding improvement or rehabilitation plan
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Any increase in the contribution rate (or other increase in contribution requirements unless due to increased levels of work, employment, or periods for which compensation is provided) that is required or made in order to enable the plan to meet the requirement of the funding improvement plan or rehabilitation plan shall be disregarded in determining the allocation of unfunded vested benefits to an employer under section 1391 of this title and in determining the highest contribution rate under section 1399(c) of this title, except for purposes of determining the unfunded vested benefits attributable to an employer under section 1391(c)(4) of this title or a comparable method approved under section 1391(c)(5) of this title.
<br>(B) Special rules
<br>
<br>For purposes of this paragraph, any increase in the contribution rate (or other increase in contribution requirements) shall be deemed to be required or made in order to enable the plan to meet the requirement of the funding improvement plan or rehabilitation plan except for increases in contribution requirements due to increased levels of work, employment, or periods for which compensation is provided or additional contributions are used to provide an increase in benefits, including an increase in future benefit accruals, permitted by subsection (d)(1)(B) or (f)(1)(B).

<br>
<br>In the case of increases in the contribution rate (or other increases in contribution requirements unless due to increased levels of work, employment, or periods for which compensation is provided) disregarded pursuant to paragraph (3), this subsection shall cease to apply as of the expiration date of the collective bargaining agreement in effect when the plan emerges from endangered or critical status. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, once the plan emerges from critical or endangered status, increases in the contribution rate disregarded pursuant to paragraph (3) shall continue to be disregarded in determining the highest contribution rate under section 1399(c) of this title for plan years during which the plan was in endangered or critical status.

<br>If, within 60 days of the due date for adoption of a funding improvement plan under subsection (c) or a rehabilitation plan under subsection (e), the plan sponsor of a plan in endangered status or a plan in critical status has not agreed on a funding improvement plan or rehabilitation plan, then any member of the board or group that constitutes the plan sponsor may require that the plan sponsor enter into an expedited dispute resolution procedure for the development and adoption of a funding improvement plan or rehabilitation plan.
<br>(i) Nonbargained participation
<br>(1) Both bargained and nonbargained employee-participants

<br>(2) Nonbargained employees only
<br>
<br>In the case of an employer that contributes to a multiemployer plan only with respect to employees who are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, this section shall be applied as if the employer were the bargaining party, and its participation agreement with the plan were a collective bargaining agreement with a term ending on the first day of the plan year beginning after the employer is provided the schedule or schedules described in subsections (c) and (e).

<br>§1085a. Minimum funding standards
<br>(a) General rule
<br>
<br>For purposes of section 1082 of this title, the term "accumulated funding deficiency" for a CSEC plan means the excess of the total charges to the funding standard account for all plan years (beginning with the first plan year to which section 1082 of this title applies) over the total credits to such account for such years or, if less, the excess of the total charges to the alternative minimum funding standard account for such plan years over the total credits to such account for such years.
<br>(b) Funding standard account
<br>(1) Account required
<br>
<br>Each plan to which this section applies shall establish and maintain a funding standard account. Such account shall be credited and charged solely as provided in this section.
<br>(2) Charges to account
<br>
<br>For a plan year, the funding standard account shall be charged with the sum of—
<br>
<br>(A) the normal cost of the plan for the plan year,
<br>
<br>(B) the amounts necessary to amortize in equal annual installments (until fully amortized)—
<br>
<br>(i) in the case of a plan in existence on January 1, 1974, the unfunded past service liability under the plan on the first day of the first plan year to which section 1082 of this title applies, over a period of 40 plan years,
<br>
<br>(ii) in the case of a plan which comes into existence after January 1, 1974, but before the first day of the first plan year beginning after December 31, 2013, the unfunded past service liability under the plan on the first day of the first plan year to which section 1082 of this title applies, over a period of 30 plan years,
<br>
<br>(iii) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net increase (if any) in unfunded past service liability under the plan arising from plan amendments adopted in such year, over a period of 15 plan years,
<br>
<br>(iv) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net experience loss (if any) under the plan, over a period of 5 plan years, and
<br>
<br>(v) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net loss (if any) resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions used under the plan, over a period of 10 plan years,
<br>
<br>(C) the amount necessary to amortize each waived funding deficiency (within the meaning of section 1082(c)(3) of this title) for each prior plan year in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over a period of 5 plan years,
<br>
<br>(D) the amount necessary to amortize in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over a period of 5 plan years any amount credited to the funding standard account under paragraph (3)(D), and
<br>
<br>(E) the amount necessary to amortize in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over a period of 20 years the contributions which would be required to be made under the plan but for the provisions of section 1082(c)(7)(A)(i)(I) of this title (as in effect on the day before August 17, 2006).
<br>(3) Credits to account
<br>
<br>For a plan year, the funding standard account shall be credited with the sum of—
<br>
<br>(A) the amount considered contributed by the employer to or under the plan for the plan year,
<br>
<br>(B) the amount necessary to amortize in equal annual installments (until fully amortized)—
<br>
<br>(i) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net decrease (if any) in unfunded past service liability under the plan arising from plan amendments adopted in such year, over a period of 15 plan years,
<br>
<br>(ii) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net experience gain (if any) under the plan, over a period of 5 plan years, and
<br>
<br>(iii) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net gain (if any) resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions used under the plan, over a period of 10 plan years,
<br>
<br>(C) the amount of the waived funding deficiency (within the meaning of section 1082(c)(3) of this title) for the plan year, and
<br>
<br>(D) in the case of a plan year for which the accumulated funding deficiency is determined under the funding standard account if such plan year follows a plan year for which such deficiency was determined under the alternative minimum funding standard, the excess (if any) of any debit balance in the funding standard account (determined without regard to this subparagraph) over any debit balance in the alternative minimum funding standard account.
<br>(4) Combining and offsetting amounts to be amortized
<br>
<br>Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, amounts required to be amortized under paragraph (2) or paragraph (3), as the case may be—
<br>
<br>(A) may be combined into one amount under such paragraph to be amortized over a period determined on the basis of the remaining amortization period for all items entering into such combined amount, and
<br>
<br>(B) may be offset against amounts required to be amortized under the other such paragraph, with the resulting amount to be amortized over a period determined on the basis of the remaining amortization periods for all items entering into whichever of the two amounts being offset is the greater.
<br>(5) Interest
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the funding standard account (and items therein) shall be charged or credited (as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury) with interest at the appropriate rate consistent with the rate or rates of interest used under the plan to determine costs.
<br>(B) Exception
<br>
<br>The interest rate used for purposes of computing the amortization charge described in subsection (b)(2)(C) or for purposes of any arrangement under subsection (d) for any plan year shall be the greater of—
<br>
<br>(i) 150 percent of the Federal mid-term rate (as in effect under section 1274 of title 26 for the 1st month of such plan year), or
<br>
<br>(ii) the rate of interest determined under subparagraph (A).
<br>(6) Amortization schedules in effect
<br>
<br>Amortization schedules for amounts described in paragraphs (2) and (3) that are in effect as of the last day of the last plan year beginning before January 1, 2014, by reason of section 104 of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 shall remain in effect pursuant to their terms and this section, except that such amounts shall not be amortized again under this section.
<br>(c) Special rules
<br>(1) Determinations to be made under funding method
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, normal costs, accrued liability, past service liabilities, and experience gains and losses shall be determined under the funding method used to determine costs under the plan.
<br>(2) Valuation of assets
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, the value of the plan's assets shall be determined on the basis of any reasonable actuarial method of valuation which takes into account fair market value and which is permitted under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.
<br>(B) Dedicated bond portfolio
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Treasury may by regulations provide that the value of any dedicated bond portfolio of a plan shall be determined by using the interest rate under section 1082(b)(5) of this title (as in effect on the day before August 17, 2006).
<br>(3) Actuarial assumptions must be reasonable
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, all costs, liabilities, rates of interest, and other factors under the plan shall be determined on the basis of actuarial assumptions and methods—
<br>
<br>(A) each of which is reasonable (taking into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations), and
<br>
<br>(B) which, in combination, offer the actuary's best estimate of anticipated experience under the plan.
<br>(4) Treatment of certain changes as experience gain or loss
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, if—
<br>
<br>(A) a change in benefits under the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] or in other retirement benefits created under Federal or State law, or
<br>
<br>(B) a change in the definition of the term "wages" under section 3121 of title 26 or a change in the amount of such wages taken into account under regulations prescribed for purposes of section 401(a)(5) of such title,
<br>
<br>results in an increase or decrease in accrued liability under a plan, such increase or decrease shall be treated as an experience loss or gain.
<br>(5) Funding method and plan year
<br>(A) Funding methods available
<br>
<br>All funding methods available to CSEC plans under section 1082 of this title (as in effect on the day before August 17, 2006) shall continue to be available under this section.
<br>(B) Changes
<br>
<br>If the funding method for a plan is changed, the new funding method shall become the funding method used to determine costs and liabilities under the plan only if the change is approved by the Secretary of the Treasury. If the plan year for a plan is changed, the new plan year shall become the plan year for the plan only if the change is approved by the Secretary of the Treasury.
<br>(C) Approval required for certain changes in assumptions by certain single-employer plans subject to additional funding requirement
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>No actuarial assumption (other than the assumptions described in subsection (h)(3)) used to determine the current liability for a plan to which this subparagraph applies may be changed without the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury.
<br>(ii) Plans to which subparagraph applies
<br>
<br>This subparagraph shall apply to a plan only if—
<br>
<br>(I) the plan is a CSEC plan,
<br>
<br>(II) the aggregate unfunded vested benefits as of the close of the preceding plan year (as determined under section 1306(a)(3)(E)(iii) of this title) of such plan and all other plans maintained by the contributing sponsors (as defined in section 1301(a)(13) of this title) and members of such sponsors' controlled groups (as defined in section 1301(a)(14) of this title) which are covered by subchapter III (disregarding plans with no unfunded vested benefits) exceed $50,000,000, and
<br>
<br>(III) the change in assumptions (determined after taking into account any changes in interest rate and mortality table) results in a decrease in the funding shortfall of the plan for the current plan year that exceeds $50,000,000, or that exceeds $5,000,000 and that is 5 percent or more of the current liability of the plan before such change.
<br>(6) Full funding
<br>
<br>If, as of the close of a plan year, a plan would (without regard to this paragraph) have an accumulated funding deficiency (determined without regard to the alternative minimum funding standard account permitted under subsection (e)) in excess of the full funding limitation—
<br>
<br>(A) the funding standard account shall be credited with the amount of such excess, and
<br>
<br>(B) all amounts described in paragraphs (2)(B), (C), and (D) and (3)(B) of subsection (b) which are required to be amortized shall be considered fully amortized for purposes of such paragraphs.
<br>(7) Full-funding limitation
<br>
<br>For purposes of paragraph (6), the term "full-funding limitation" means the excess (if any) of—
<br>
<br>(A) the accrued liability (including normal cost) under the plan (determined under the entry age normal funding method if such accrued liability cannot be directly calculated under the funding method used for the plan), over
<br>
