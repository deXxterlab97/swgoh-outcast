<br>
<br>The words "executive agency" are substituted for "agency" because the definition of "agency" in 31:665(d)(2) applies to the source provisions restated in the section and because of section 102 of the revised title. The word "Mayor" is used because of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (eff. Aug. 11, 1967, 81 Stat. 948) and sections 421, 422, and 771 of the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act (Pub. L. 93–198, 87 Stat. 789, 818). The word "President" is substituted for "President, through the Director of the Office of Management and Budget" because sections 101 and 102(a) of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970 (eff. July 1, 1970, 84 Stat. 2085) designated the Bureau of the Budget as the Office of Management and Budget and transferred all functions of the Bureau to the President.

For the purposes of this subparagraph, an administrative action is commenced with respect to a failure when an investigating official determines in writing to commence an investigation of an allegation of such failure.
<br>
<br>(3) Sections 3803 (except for subsection (c)), 3804, 3805, 3806, 3807, 3808, and 3812 of this title shall be applied, consistent with the requirements of this section, to the imposition and collection of civil penalties under this subsection.

<br>§1512. Apportionment and reserves
<br>
<br>(a) Except as provided in this subchapter, an appropriation available for obligation for a definite period shall be apportioned to prevent obligation or expenditure at a rate that would indicate a necessity for a deficiency or supplemental appropriation for the period. An appropriation for an indefinite period and authority to make obligations by contract before appropriations shall be apportioned to achieve the most effective and economical use. An apportionment may be reapportioned under this section.
<br>
<br>(b)(1) An appropriation subject to apportionment is apportioned by—
<br>
<br>(A) months, calendar quarters, operating seasons, or other time periods;
<br>
<br>(B) activities, functions, projects, or objects; or
<br>
<br>(C) a combination of the ways referred to in clauses (A) and (B) of this paragraph.
<br>
<br>(2) The official designated in section 1513 of this title to make apportionments shall apportion an appropriation under paragraph (1) of this subsection as the official considers appropriate. Except as specified by the official, an amount apportioned is available for obligation under the terms of the appropriation on a cumulative basis unless reapportioned.
<br>
<br>(c)(1) In apportioning or reapportioning an appropriation, a reserve may be established only—
<br>
<br>(A) to provide for contingencies;
<br>
<br>(B) to achieve savings made possible by or through changes in requirements or greater efficiency of operations; or
<br>
<br>(C) as specifically provided by law.
<br>
<br>(2) A reserve established under this subsection may be changed as necessary to carry out the scope and objectives of the appropriation concerned. When an official designated in section 1513 of this title to make apportionments decides that an amount reserved will not be required to carry out the objectives and scope of the appropriation concerned, the official shall recommend the rescission of the amount in the way provided in chapter 11 of this title for appropriation requests. Reserves established under this section shall be reported to Congress as provided in the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 681 et seq.).
<br>
<br>(d) An apportionment or a reapportionment shall be reviewed at least 4 times a year by the official designated in section 1513 of this title to make apportionments.

July 1, 1970, 84 Stat. 2085) designated the Bureau of the Budget as the Office of Management and Budget and transferred all functions of the Bureau to the President.
<br>
<br>In subsection (b)(1), the words "(except the Commission)" are added because the International Trade Commission is covered specifically by the source provisions restated in subsection (a).

The words "By the first day" are substituted for "on or before the beginning", and the words "of the United States Government" are added, for clarity. The words "major organizational unit" are substituted for "office or bureau" for consistency in the revised section. The word "changed" is substituted for "increased or diminished" to eliminate unnecessary words.
<br>
<br>In subsection (e), the words "initiation and operation" are substituted for "initiation, operation, and administration" to eliminate unnecessary words.
<br>§1514. Administrative division of apportionments
<br>
<br>(a) The official having administrative control of an appropriation available to the legislative branch, the judicial branch, the United States International Trade Commission, or the District of Columbia government, and, subject to the approval of the President, the head of each executive agency (except the Commission) shall prescribe by regulation a system of administrative control not inconsistent with accounting procedures prescribed under law. The system shall be designed to—
<br>
<br>(1) restrict obligations or expenditures from each appropriation to the amount of apportionments or reapportionments of the appropriation; and
<br>
<br>(2) enable the official or the head of the executive agency to fix responsibility for an obligation or expenditure exceeding an apportionment or reapportionment.
<br>
<br>(b) To have a simplified system for administratively dividing appropriations, the head of each executive agency (except the Commission) shall work toward the objective of financing each operating unit, at the highest practical level, from not more than one administrative division for each appropriation affecting the unit.

<br>(a) An appropriation required to be apportioned under section 1512 of this title may be apportioned on a basis that indicates the need for a deficiency or supplemental appropriation to the extent necessary to permit payment of such pay increases as may be granted pursuant to law to civilian officers and employees (including prevailing rate employees whose pay is fixed and adjusted under subchapter IV of chapter 53 of title 5) and to retired and active military personnel.
<br>
<br>(b)(1) Except as provided in subsection (a) of this section, an official may make, and the head of an executive agency may request, an apportionment under section 1512 of this title that would indicate a necessity for a deficiency or supplemental appropriation only when the official or agency head decides that the action is required because of—
<br>
<br>(A) a law enacted after submission to Congress of the estimates for an appropriation that requires an expenditure beyond administrative control; or
<br>
<br>(B) an emergency involving the safety of human life, the protection of property, or the immediate welfare of individuals when an appropriation that would allow the United States Government to pay, or contribute to, amounts required to be paid to individuals in specific amounts fixed by law or under formulas prescribed by law, is insufficient.
<br>
<br>(2) If an official making an apportionment decides that an apportionment would indicate a necessity for a deficiency or supplemental appropriation, the official shall submit immediately a detailed report of the facts to Congress. The report shall be referred to in submitting a proposed deficiency or supplemental appropriation.

<br>In the section, the word "agency" is substituted for "executive department or independent establishment of the Government" for clarity. See 12 Comp. Gen. 442 (1932) and United States v. Mitchell, 425 F. Supp. 917 (D.D.C. 1976). The words "major organizational unit" or "unit" are substituted for "bureau or office" for consistency in the revised title. The words "to fill the order" or "filling the order" are substituted for "such requisitioned" and "as may be requisitioned" for clarity and because of the restatement. The words "goods or services" are substituted for "materials, supplies, equipment, work, or services" to eliminate unnecessary words.
<br>
<br>In subsection (a)(4), the words "the head of the agency decides" are added, and the words "commercial enterprise" are substituted for "private agencies", for clarity. The words "by competitive bids" are omitted as surplus because of various procurement laws.
<br>
<br>In subsection (b), the words "The Secretary of Defense" are added for clarity because of Comptroller General decision B–20179 (Apr. 1, 1981). The words "a military department of the Department of Defense" are substituted for "the Department of the Army, Navy Department" for consistency with title 10 and to apply the source provisions to the Department of the Air Force because of sections 205(a) and 207(a) and (f) of the Act of July 26, 1947 (ch. 343, 61 Stat. 501, 502), and section 1 of the Act of August 10, 1956 (ch. 1041, 70A Stat. 488). The words "Secretary of Transportation in carrying out duties and powers related to aviation and the Coast Guard" are substituted for "Federal Aviation Agency, Coast Guard" to reflect the transfer of those functions to the Secretary of Transportation. The words "the Administrator of General Services" are added to reflect the transfer of the functions of the Bureau of Federal Supply of the Treasury Department to the Administrator by section 102(a) of the Act of June 30, 1949 (40:752(a)). The words "the Administrator of" are added before "Maritime Administration" for clarity and consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.
<br>
<br>In subsection (c), the words "pursuant to such order" are omitted as unnecessary.
<br>
<br>Subsection (d) is substituted for the source provisions being restated to reflect decisions of the Comptroller General, including 31 Comp. Gen. 83 (1951), 34 Comp. Gen. 418 (1955), 39 Comp. Gen. 317 (1959), and 55 Comp. Gen. 1497 (1976).
<br>
<br>In subsection (e), the words "any Government department or independent establishment, or any bureau or office thereof" and "except as otherwise provided by law" are omitted as unnecessary because of the restatement. The text of 31:686b(a) is omitted as executed.
