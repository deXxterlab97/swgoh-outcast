<br>(k) Death by heart attack, stroke, or vascular rupture; presumption
<br>
<br>As determined by the Bureau, a heart attack, stroke, or vascular rupture suffered by a public safety officer shall be presumed to constitute a personal injury within the meaning of subsection (a), sustained in the line of duty by the officer and directly and proximately resulting in death, if—
<br>
<br>(1) the public safety officer, while on duty—
<br>
<br>(A) engages in a situation involving nonroutine stressful or strenuous physical law enforcement, fire suppression, rescue, hazardous material response, emergency medical services, prison security, disaster relief, or other emergency response activity; or
<br>
<br>(B) participates in a training exercise involving nonroutine stressful or strenuous physical activity;
<br>
<br>(2) the heart attack, stroke, or vascular rupture commences—
<br>
<br>(A) while the officer is engaged or participating as described in paragraph (1);
<br>
<br>(B) while the officer remains on that duty after being engaged or participating as described in paragraph (1); or
<br>
<br>(C) not later than 24 hours after the officer is engaged or participating as described in paragraph (1); and
<br>
<br>(3) the heart attack, stroke, or vascular rupture directly and proximately results in the death of the public safety officer,
<br>
<br>unless competent medical evidence establishes that the heart attack, stroke, or vascular rupture was unrelated to the engagement or participation or was directly and proximately caused by something other than the mere presence of cardiovascular-disease risk factors.
<br>(l) Definition
<br>
<br>For purposes of subsection (k), "nonroutine stressful or strenuous physical" excludes actions of a clerical, administrative, or nonmanual nature.
<br>(m) Suspension or end of collection action
<br>
<br>The Bureau may suspend or end collection action on an amount disbursed pursuant to a statute enacted retroactively or otherwise disbursed in error under subsection (a) or (c), where such collection would be impractical, or would cause undue hardship to a debtor who acted in good faith.
<br>(n) Confidentiality
<br>
<br>The public safety agency, organization, or unit responsible for maintaining on file an executed designation of beneficiary or executed life insurance policy for purposes of subsection (a)(4) shall maintain the confidentiality of the designation or policy in the same manner as the agency, organization, or unit maintains personnel or other similar records of the public safety officer.

<br>Safeguarding America's First Responders
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 116–157, Aug. 14, 2020, 134 Stat. 704, provided that:
<br>"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
<br>
<br>"This Act may be cited as the 'Safeguarding America's First Responders Act of 2020'.
<br>"SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS; PURPOSE.
<br>
<br>"(a) Sense of Congress.—It is the sense of Congress that—
<br>
<br>"(1) an infectious disease pandemic known as COVID–19 exists;
<br>
<br>"(2) to date, there is much still unknown about COVID–19, but it is known that COVID–19 and related complications may be fatal;
<br>
<br>"(3) services provided by public safety officers are nonetheless essential during this pandemic;
<br>
<br>"(4) due to the COVID–19 pandemic and what is currently known about how the disease is spread, public safety officers are uncharacteristically at risk of contracting the disease; and
<br>
<br>"(5) although the Public Safety Officers' Benefits program currently covers deaths and permanent and total disabilities resulting from infectious disease sustained by public safety officers in carrying out their duties, the determination of claims involving personal injuries believed to have resulted from COVID–19 or its complications may be uniquely challenging or delayed given the lack of—
<br>
<br>"(A) definitive testing and medical records at this time; and
<br>
<br>"(B) a definitive uniform body of medical information about how the disease is spread or its effects.
<br>
<br>"(b) Purpose.—The purpose of this Act is to establish a carefully drawn framework wherein claims under the Public Safety Officers' Benefits program, arising under the unique circumstances described in subsection (a), can be processed expeditiously and under fair and clear standards.
<br>"SEC. 3. PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICER BENEFITS.
<br>
<br>"(a) Death Benefits.—As determined by the Bureau of Justice Assistance, unless competent medical evidence establishes that the death of a public safety officer (as defined in section 1204 of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10284)) was directly and proximately caused by something other than COVID–19, COVID–19 (or complications therefrom) suffered by the public safety officer shall be presumed to constitute a personal injury within the meaning of section 1201(a) of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10281(a)), sustained in the line of duty by the officer and directly and proximately resulting in death, if—
<br>
<br>"(1) the officer engaged in a line of duty action or activity between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021;
<br>
<br>"(2) the officer was diagnosed with COVID–19 (or evidence indicates that the officer had COVID–19) during the 45-day period beginning on the last day of duty of the officer; and
<br>
<br>"(3) evidence indicates that the officer had COVID–19 (or complications therefrom) at the time of the officer's death.
<br>
<br>"(b) Disability Benefits.—As determined by the Bureau of Justice Assistance, COVID–19 (or complications therefrom) suffered by a public safety officer shall be presumed to constitute a personal injury within the meaning of section 1201(b) of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10281(b)), sustained in the line of duty by the officer, if—
<br>
<br>"(1) the officer engaged in a line of duty action or activity between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021; and
<br>
<br>"(2) the officer was diagnosed with COVID–19 (or evidence indicates that the officer had COVID–19) during the 45-day period beginning on the last day of duty of the officer."
<br>§10282. Limitations on benefits
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>No benefit shall be paid under this subchapter—
<br>
<br>(1) if the fatal or catastrophic injury was caused by the intentional misconduct of the public safety officer or by such officer's intention to bring about his death, disability, or injury;
<br>
<br>(2) if the public safety officer was voluntarily intoxicated at the time of his fatal or catastrophic injury;
<br>
<br>(3) if the public safety officer was performing his duties in a grossly negligent manner at the time of his fatal or catastrophic injury;
<br>
<br>(4) to any individual who would otherwise be entitled to a benefit under this subchapter if such individual's actions were a substantial contributing factor to the fatal or catastrophic injury of the public safety officer; or
<br>
<br>(5) with respect to any individual employed in a capacity other than a civilian capacity.
<br>(b) Presumption
<br>
<br>In determining whether a benefit is payable under this subchapter, the Bureau—
<br>
<br>(1) shall presume that none of the limitations described in subsection (a) apply; and
<br>
<br>(2) shall not determine that a limitation described in subsection (a) applies, absent clear and convincing evidence.
