<br>Congressional Findings
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 108–374, §2, Oct. 27, 2004, 118 Stat. 1773, provided that: "Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>"(1) the Act of February 8, 1887 (commonly known as the 'Indian General Allotment Act') (25 U.S.C. 331 et seq.), which authorized the allotment of Indian reservations, did not permit Indian allotment owners to provide for the testamentary disposition of the land that was allotted to them;
<br>
<br>"(2) that Act provided that allotments would descend according to State law of intestate succession based on the location of the allotment;
<br>
<br>"(3) the reliance of the Federal Government on the State law of intestate succession with respect to the descent of allotments has resulted in numerous problems affecting Indian tribes, members of Indian tribes, and the Federal Government, including—
<br>
<br>"(A) the increasingly fractionated ownership of trust and restricted land as that land is inherited by successive generations of owners as tenants in common;
<br>
<br>"(B) the application of different rules of intestate succession to each interest of a decedent in or to trust or restricted land if that land is located within the boundaries of more than 1 State, which application—
<br>
<br>"(i) makes probate planning unnecessarily difficult; and
<br>
<br>"(ii) impedes efforts to provide probate planning assistance or advice;
<br>
<br>"(C) the absence of a uniform general probate code for trust and restricted land, which makes it difficult for Indian tribes to work cooperatively to develop tribal probate codes; and
<br>
<br>"(D) the failure of Federal law to address or provide for many of the essential elements of general probate law, either directly or by reference, which—
<br>
<br>"(i) is unfair to the owners of trust and restricted land (and heirs and devisees of owners); and
<br>
<br>"(ii) makes probate planning more difficult;
<br>
<br>"(4) a uniform Federal probate code would likely—
<br>
<br>"(A) reduce the number of fractionated interests in trust or restricted land;
<br>
<br>"(B) facilitate efforts to provide probate planning assistance and advice and create incentives for owners of trust and restricted land to engage in estate planning;
<br>
<br>"(C) facilitate intertribal efforts to produce tribal probate codes in accordance with section 206 of the Indian Land Consolidation Act (25 U.S.C. 2205); and
<br>
<br>"(D) provide essential elements of general probate law that are not applicable on the date of enactment of this Act [Oct. 27, 2004] to interests in trust or restricted land; and
<br>
<br>"(5) the provisions of a uniform Federal probate code and other forth [sic] in this Act [see Short Title of 2004 Amendment note above] should operate to further the policy of the United States as stated in the Indian Land Consolidated Act Amendments of 2000, Public Law 106–462, [§]102, November 7, 2000, 114 Stat. 1992 [set out as a note below]."
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 106–462, title I, §101, Nov. 7, 2000, 114 Stat. 1991, provided that: "Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>"(1) in the 1800's and early 1900's, the United States sought to assimilate Indian people into the surrounding non-Indian culture by allotting tribal lands to individual members of Indian tribes;
<br>
<br>"(2) as a result of the allotment Acts and related Federal policies, over 90,000,000 acres of land have passed from tribal ownership;
<br>
<br>"(3) many trust allotments were taken out of trust status, often without their owner's consent;
<br>
<br>"(4) without restrictions on alienation, allotment owners were subject to exploitation and their allotments were often sold or disposed of without any tangible or enduring benefit to their owners;
<br>
<br>"(5) the trust periods for trust allotments have been extended indefinitely;
<br>
<br>"(6) because of the inheritance provisions in the original treaties or allotment Acts, the ownership of many of the trust allotments that have remained in trust status has become fractionated into hundreds or thousands of undivided interests, many of which represent 2 percent or less of the total interests;
<br>
<br>"(7) Congress has authorized the acquisition of lands in trust for individual Indians, and many of those lands have also become fractionated by subsequent inheritance;
<br>
<br>"(8) the acquisitions referred to in paragraph (7) continue to be made;
<br>
<br>"(9) the fractional interests described in this section often provide little or no return to the beneficial owners of those interests and the administrative costs borne by the United States for those interests are inordinately high;
<br>
<br>"(10) in Babbitt v. Youpee (117 S[.] Ct. 727 (1997)), the United States Supreme Court found the application of section 207 of the Indian Land Consolidation Act (25 U.S.C. 2206) to the facts presented in that case to be unconstitutional, forcing the Department of the Interior to address the status of thousands of undivided interests in trust and restricted lands;
<br>
<br>"(11)(A) on February 19, 1999, the Secretary of the Interior issued a Secretarial Order which officially reopened the probate of all estates where an interest in land was ordered to escheat to an Indian tribe pursuant to section 207 of the Indian Land Consolidation Act (25 U.S.C. 2206); and
<br>
<br>"(B) the Secretarial Order also directed appropriate officials of the Bureau of Indian Affairs to distribute such interests 'to the rightful heirs and beneficiaries without regard to 25 U.S.C. 2206';
<br>
<br>"(12) in the absence of comprehensive remedial legislation, the number of the fractional interests will continue to grow exponentially;
<br>
<br>"(13) the problem of the fractionation of Indian lands described in this section is the result of a policy of the Federal Government, cannot be solved by Indian tribes, and requires a solution under Federal law.[;]
<br>
<br>"(14) any devise or inheritance of an interest in trust or restricted Indian lands is a matter of Federal law; and
<br>
<br>"(15) consistent with the Federal policy of tribal self-determination, the Federal Government should encourage the recognized tribal government that exercises jurisdiction over a reservation to establish a tribal probate code for that reservation."
<br>Declaration of Policy
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 106–462, title I, §102, Nov. 7, 2000, 114 Stat. 1992, provided that: "It is the policy of the United States—
<br>
<br>"(1) to prevent the further fractionation of trust allotments made to Indians;
<br>
<br>"(2) to consolidate fractional interests and ownership of those interests into usable parcels;
<br>
<br>"(3) to consolidate fractional interests in a manner that enhances tribal sovereignty;
<br>
<br>"(4) to promote tribal self-sufficiency and self-determination; and
<br>
<br>"(5) to reverse the effects of the allotment policy on Indian tribes."
<br>Authorization of Appropriations
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 106–462, title I, §105, Nov. 7, 2000, 114 Stat. 2007, provided that: "There are authorized to be appropriated not to exceed $8,000,000 for fiscal year 2001 and each subsequent fiscal year to carry out the provisions of this title [enacting sections 2205, 2206, and 2212 to 2219 of this title, amending this section and sections 348, 372, 373, 2204, 2207, and 5107 of this title, repealing sections 331 to 333, 2205, and 2206 of this title, and enacting provisions set out as notes under this section and section 2206 of this title] (and the amendments made by this title) that are not otherwise funded under the authority provided for in any other provision of Federal law."
<br>
<br>1 See References in Text note below.
<br>
<br>2 So in original. The period probably should be a semicolon.
<br>§2202. Other applicable provisions
<br>
<br>The provisions of section 5108 of this title shall apply to all tribes notwithstanding the provisions of section 5125 of this title: Provided, That nothing in this section is intended to supersede any other provision of Federal law which authorizes, prohibits, or restricts the acquisition of land for Indians with respect to any specific tribe, reservation, or state(s).
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 97–459, title II, §203, Jan. 12, 1983, 96 Stat. 2517.)
<br>§2203. Adoption of land consolidation plan with approval of Secretary
<br>(a) Statement of purpose; sales or exchanges: terms and conditions
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any tribe, acting through its governing body, is authorized, with the approval of the Secretary to adopt a land consolidation plan providing for the sale or exchange of any tribal lands or interest in lands for the purpose of eliminating undivided fractional interests in Indian trust or restricted lands or consolidating its tribal landholdings: Provided, That—
<br>
<br>(1) except as provided by subsection (c), the sale price or exchange value received by the tribe for land or interests in land covered by this section shall be no less than within 10 per centum of the fair market value as determined by the Secretary;
<br>
<br>(2) if the tribal land involved in an exchange is of greater or lesser value than the land for which it is being exchanged, the tribe may accept or give cash in such exchange in order to equalize the values of the property exchanged;
<br>
<br>(3) any proceeds from the sale of land or interests in land or proceeds received by the tribe to equalize an exchange made pursuant to this section shall be used exclusively for the purchase of other land or interests in land;
<br>
<br>(4) the Secretary shall maintain a separate trust account for each tribe selling or exchanging land pursuant to this section consisting of the proceeds of the land sales and exchanges and shall release such funds only for the purpose of buying lands under this section; and
<br>
<br>(5) any tribe may retain the mineral rights to such sold or exchanged lands and the Secretary shall assist such tribe in determining the value of such mineral rights and shall take such value into consideration in determining the fair market value of such lands.
<br>(b) Conveyancing requirement; specific findings for nonexecution
<br>
<br>The Secretary must execute such instrument of conveyance needed to effectuate a sale or exchange of tribal lands made pursuant to an approved tribal land consolidation plan unless he makes a specific finding that such sale or exchange is not in the best interest of the tribe or is not in compliance with the tribal land consolidation plan.
<br>(c) Below market value conveyance of Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma homesites
<br>
<br>The Secretary may execute instruments of conveyance for less than fair market value to effectuate the transfer of lands used as homesites held, on December 17, 1991, by the United States in trust for the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma. Only the lands used as homesites, and described in the land consolidation plan of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma approved by the Secretary on February 6, 1987, shall be subject to this subsection.

<br>Editorial Notes
<br>Amendments
<br>
<br>1991—Subsec. (a)(1). Pub. L. 102–238, §3(1), substituted "(1) except as provided by subsection (c), the sale price" for "(1) the sale price".
<br>

<br>
<br>1984—Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 98–608 amended subsec. (a) generally, substituting ": Provided, That—" for period at end and inserting five numbered pars., thereby correcting errors originally contained in this section as enacted by Pub. L. 97–459, the text of which had a portion of section 204 appearing in section 206 (classified to section 2205 of this title) as the result of inadvertent error in the execution of committee amendments (see House Report No. 97–908, Sept. 30, 1982) to the bill. Pub. L. 97–459 enacted subsec. (a) as ending with "tribal landholdings.", and included portion of section 204 containing proviso and five numbered pars. within text of section 206.
<br>
<br>Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 98–608 included subsec. (b) within this section and substituted a period for the dash after "tribal land consolidation plan", thereby correcting errors originally contained in this section as enacted by Pub. L. 97–459, which, as the result of inadvertent error in the execution of committee amendments (see House Report No. 97–908, Sept. 30, 1982) to the bill, enacted subsec. (b) as part of section 206(b) of Pub. L. 97–459 and ended it with "tribal land consolidation plan—".
<br>§2204. Purchase of trust or restricted or controlled lands at no less than fair market value; requisite conditions
<br>(a) Purchase of land
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Subject to subsection (b), any Indian tribe may purchase, at not less than fair market value and with the consent of the owners of the interests, part or all of the interests in—
<br>
<br>(A) any tract of trust or restricted land within the boundaries of the reservation of the tribe; or
<br>
<br>(B) land that is otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of the tribe.
<br>(2) Required consent
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The Indian tribe may purchase all interests in a tract described in paragraph (1) with the consent of the owners of undivided interests equal to at least 50 percent of the undivided interest in the tract.
<br>(B) Interest owned by tribe
<br>
<br>Interests owned by an Indian tribe in a tract may be included in the computation of the percentage of ownership of the undivided interests in that tract for purposes of determining whether the consent requirement under subparagraph (A) has been met.
<br>(b) Conditions applicable to purchase
<br>
<br>Subsection (a) applies on the condition that—
<br>
<br>(1) any Indian owning any undivided interest, and in actual use and possession of such tract for at least three years preceding the tribal initiative, may purchase such tract by matching the tribal offer;
<br>
<br>(2) if at any time within five years following the date of acquisition of such land by an individual pursuant to this section, such property is offered for sale or a petition is filed with the Secretary for removal of the property from trust or restricted status, the tribe shall have 180 days from the date it is notified of such offer or petition to acquire such property by paying to the owner the fair market value as determined by the Secretary; and
<br>
<br>(3) the approval of the Secretary shall be required for a land sale initiated under this section, except that such approval shall not be required with respect to a land sale transaction initiated by an Indian tribe that has in effect a land consolidation plan that has been approved by the Secretary under section 2203 of this title.
<br>(c) Partition of highly fractionated Indian lands
<br>(1) Applicability
<br>
<br>This subsection shall be applicable only to parcels of land (including surface and subsurface interests, except with respect to a subsurface interest that has been severed from the surface interest, in which case this subsection shall apply only to the surface interest) which the Secretary has determined, pursuant to paragraph (2)(B),1 to be parcels of highly fractionated Indian land.
<br>(2) Requirements
<br>
<br>Each partition action under this subsection shall be conducted by the Secretary in accordance with the following requirements:
<br>(A) Application
<br>
<br>Upon receipt of any payment or bond required under subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall commence a process for partitioning a parcel of land by sale in accordance with the provisions of this subsection upon receipt of an application by—
<br>
<br>(i) the Indian tribe with jurisdiction over the subject land that owns an undivided interest in the parcel of land; or
<br>
<br>(ii) any person owning an undivided interest in the parcel of land who is eligible to bid at the sale of the parcel pursuant to subclause (II), (III), or (IV) of subparagraph (I)(i);
<br>
<br>provided that no such application shall be valid or considered if it is received by the Secretary prior to the date that is 1 year after the date on which notice is published pursuant to section 8(a)(4) of the American Indian Probate Reform Act of 2004.
<br>(B) Costs of serving notice and publication
<br>
<br>The costs of serving and publishing notice under subparagraph (F) shall be borne by the applicant. Upon receiving written notice from the Secretary, the applicant must pay to the Secretary an amount determined by the Secretary to be the estimated costs of such service of notice and publication, or furnish a sufficient bond for such estimated costs within the time stated in the notice, failing which, unless an extension is granted by the Secretary, the Secretary shall not be required to commence the partition process under subparagraph (A) and may deny the application. The Secretary shall have the discretion and authority in any case to waive either the payment or the bond (or any portion of such payment or bond) otherwise required by this subparagraph, upon making a determination that such waiver will further the policies of this chapter.
<br>(C) Determination
<br>
<br>Upon receipt of an application pursuant to subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall determine whether the subject parcel meets the requirements set forth in section 2201(6) of this title to be classified as a parcel of highly fractionated Indian land.
<br>(D) Consent requirements
<br>(i) In general

<br>
<br>(III) the owners (including parents of minor owners and legal guardians of incompetent owners) of at least 50 percent of the undivided interests in the parcel, but only in cases where the Secretary determines that, based on the final appraisal prepared pursuant to subparagraph (F), any 1 owner's total undivided interest in the parcel (not including the interest of an Indian tribe or that of the owner requesting the partition) has a value in excess of $1,500.
<br>
<br> Any consent required by this clause must be in writing and acknowledged before a notary public (or other official authorized to make acknowledgments), and shall be approved by the Secretary unless the Secretary has reason to believe that the consent was obtained as a result of fraud or undue influence.
<br>(ii) Consent by the Secretary on behalf of certain individuals
<br>
<br>For the purposes of clause (i)(III), the Secretary may consent on behalf of—
<br>
<br>(I) undetermined heirs of trust or restricted interests and owners of such interests who are minors and legal incompetents having no parents or legal guardian; and

<br>
<br>(I) purchase the parcel of land for its appraised fair market value on behalf of the Indian tribe with jurisdiction over the land, subject to the lien and procedures provided under section 2213(b) of this title; or
<br>
<br>(II) terminate the partition process.
<br>(ii) Lack of consent
<br>
<br>If an applicant fails to obtain any applicable consent required under the provisions of subparagraph (D) by the date established by the Secretary prior to the proposed sale, the Secretary may either extend the time for obtaining any such consent or deny the request for partition.

<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>If a partition is approved under this subsection and an owner of an interest in the parcel of land refuses to surrender possession in accordance with the partition decision, or refuses to execute any conveyance necessary to implement the partition, then any affected owner or the United States may—

<br>
<br>(A) shall descend according to an applicable tribal probate code approved in accordance with section 2205 of this title; or
<br>
<br>(B) in the case of a trust or restricted interest in land or interest in trust personalty to which a tribal probate code does not apply, shall descend in accordance with—

<br>(i) paragraphs (2) through (5); and
<br>
<br>(ii) other applicable Federal law.
<br>(2) 1 Rules governing descent of estate
<br>(A) Surviving spouse
<br>
<br>If there is a surviving spouse of the decedent, such spouse shall receive trust and restricted land and trust personalty in the estate as follows:
<br>
<br>(i) If the decedent is survived by 1 or more eligible heirs described in subparagraph (B)(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv), the surviving spouse shall receive 1/3 of the trust personalty of the decedent and a life estate without regard to waste in the interests in trust or restricted lands of the decedent.
<br>
<br>(ii) If there are no eligible heirs described in subparagraph (B)(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv), the surviving spouse shall receive all of the trust personalty of the decedent and a life estate without regard to waste in the trust or restricted lands of the decedent.
<br>
<br>(iii) The remainder shall pass as set forth in subparagraph (B).
<br>
<br>(iv) Trust personalty passing to a surviving spouse under the provisions of this subparagraph shall be maintained by the Secretary in an account as trust personalty, but only if such spouse is Indian.
<br>(B) Individual and tribal heirs
<br>
<br>Where there is no surviving spouse of the decedent, or there is a remainder interest pursuant to subparagraph (A), the trust or restricted estate or such remainder shall, subject to subparagraphs (A) and (D), pass as follows:
<br>
<br>(i) To those of the decedent's children who are eligible heirs (or if 1 or more of such children do not survive the decedent, the children of any such deceased child who are eligible heirs, by right of representation, but only if such children of the deceased child survive the decedent) in equal shares.
<br>
<br>(ii) If the property does not pass under clause (i), to those of the decedent's surviving great-grandchildren who are eligible heirs, in equal shares.
<br>
<br>(iii) If the property does not pass under clause (i) or (ii), to the decedent's surviving parent who is an eligible heir, and if both parents survive the decedent and are both eligible heirs, to both parents in equal shares.

<br>(v) If the property does not pass under clause (i), (ii), (iii), or (iv), to the Indian tribe with jurisdiction over the interests in trust or restricted lands;
<br>
<br>except that notwithstanding clause (v), an Indian co-owner (including the Indian tribe referred to in clause (v)) of a parcel of trust or restricted land may acquire an interest that would otherwise descend under that clause by paying into the estate of the decedent, before the close of the probate of the estate, the fair market value of the interest in the land; if more than 1 Indian co-owner offers to pay for such interest, the highest bidder shall acquire the interest.
<br>(C) No Indian tribe
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>If there is no Indian tribe with jurisdiction over the interests in trust or restricted lands that would otherwise descend under subparagraph (B)(v), then such interests shall be divided equally among co-owners of trust or restricted interests in the parcel; if there are no such co-owners, then to the United States, provided that any such interests in land passing to the United States under this subparagraph shall be sold by the Secretary and the proceeds from such sale deposited into the land acquisition fund established under section 2215 of this title and used for the purposes described in subsection (b) of that section.
<br>(ii) Contiguous parcel
<br>
<br>If the interests passing to the United States under this subparagraph are in a parcel of land that is contiguous to another parcel of trust or restricted land, the Secretary shall give the owner or owners of the trust or restricted interest in the contiguous parcel the first opportunity to purchase the interest at not less than fair market value determined in accordance with this chapter. If more than 1 such owner in the contiguous parcel request to purchase the parcel, the Secretary shall sell the parcel by public auction or sealed bid (as determined by the Secretary) at not less than fair market value to the owner of a trust or restricted interest in the contiguous parcel submitting the highest bid.
<br>(D) Intestate descent of small fractional interests in land

<br>Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A) and (B), and subject to any applicable Federal law, any trust or restricted interest in land in the decedent's estate that is not disposed of by a valid will and represents less than 5 percent of the entire undivided ownership of the parcel of land of which such interest is a part, as evidenced by the decedent's estate inventory at the time of the heirship determination, shall descend in accordance with clauses (ii) through (v).
<br>(ii) Surviving spouse
<br>
<br>If there is a surviving spouse, and such spouse was residing on a parcel of land described in clause (i) at the time of the decedent's death, the spouse shall receive a life estate without regard to waste in the decedent's trust or restricted interest in only such parcel, and the remainder interest in that parcel shall pass in accordance with clause (iii).
<br>(iii) Single heir rule
<br>
<br>Where there is no life estate created under clause (ii) or there is a remainder interest under that clause, the trust or restricted interest or remainder interest that is subject to this subparagraph shall descend, in trust or restricted status, to—

<br>
<br>(IV) if the interest does not pass under subclause (I), (II), or (III), the Indian tribe with jurisdiction over the interest; or
<br>
<br>(V) if the interest does not pass under subclause (I), (II), or (III), and there is no such Indian tribe to inherit the property under subclause (IV), the interest shall be divided equally among co-owners of trust or restricted interests in the parcel; and if there are no such co-owners, then to the United States, to be sold, and the proceeds from sale used, in the same manner provided in subparagraph (C).
<br>
<br>The determination of which person is the oldest eligible heir for inheritance purposes under this clause shall be made by the Secretary in the decedent's probate proceeding and shall be consistent with the provisions of this chapter.
<br>(iv) Exceptions
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding clause (iii)—
<br>
<br>(I)(aa) the heir of an interest under this subparagraph, unless the heir is a minor or incompetent person, may agree in writing entered into the record of the decedent's probate proceeding to renounce such interest, in trust or restricted status, in favor of—
<br>
<br>(AA) any other eligible heir or Indian person related to the heir by blood, but in any case never in favor of more than 1 such heir or person;
<br>
<br>(BB) not more than 1 co-owner of another trust or restricted interest in such parcel of land; or
<br>
<br>(CC) the Indian tribe with jurisdiction over the interest, if any; and
<br>
<br>(bb) the Secretary shall give effect to such agreement in the distribution of the interest in the probate proceeding; and
<br>
<br>(II) the governing body of the Indian tribe with jurisdiction over an interest in trust or restricted land that is subject to the provisions of this subparagraph may adopt a rule of intestate descent applicable to such interest that differs from the order of descent set forth in clause (iii). The Secretary shall apply such rule to the interest in distributing the decedent's estate, but only if—
<br>
<br>(aa) a copy of the tribal rule is delivered to the official designated by the Secretary to receive copies of tribal rules for the purposes of this clause;
<br>
<br>(bb) the tribal rule provides for the intestate inheritance of such interest by no more than 1 heir, so that the interest does not further fractionate;
<br>
<br>(cc) the tribal rule does not apply to any interest disposed of by a valid will;
<br>
<br>(dd) the decedent died on or after the date described in subsection (b) of section 8 of the American Indian Probate 2 Act of 2004, or on or after the date on which a copy of the tribal rule was delivered to the Secretary pursuant to item (aa), whichever is later; and

<br>
<br>Nothing in this subparagraph limits the right of any person to devise any trust or restricted interest pursuant to a valid will in accordance with subsection (b).

<br>
<br>If, under this subsection, all or any part of the estate of a decedent is to pass to children of a deceased child by right of representation, that part is to be divided into as many equal shares as there are living children of the decedent and pre-deceased children who left issue who survive the decedent. Each living child of the decedent, if any, shall receive 1 share, and the share of each pre-deceased child shall be divided equally among the pre-deceased child's children.

<br>
<br>(B) the heirs of the decedent shall be determined in accordance with this section.

<br>
<br>Except as provided in paragraphs (2)(A) and (D) regarding the life estate of a surviving spouse, a trust or restricted interest in land or trust personalty that descends under the provisions of this subsection shall vest in the heir in the same trust or restricted status as such interest was held immediately prior to the decedent's death.

<br>
<br>(i) descend to each eligible heir to whom the trust or restricted interest in land in the estate descends pursuant to this subsection; or
<br>
<br>(ii) pass to the recipient of the trust or restricted interest in land in the estate pursuant to a renunciation under subsection (j)(8).

<br>(2) Devise of trust or restricted land as a life estate or in fee
<br>(A) In general
<br>

<br>(II) subparagraph (A)(i); or
<br>
<br>(III) paragraph (1)(A).
<br>(ii) Exception
<br>(I) In general
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding clause (i), in any case in which a resolution, law, or other duly adopted enactment of the Indian tribe with jurisdiction over the land of which an interest described in clause (i) is a part requests the Secretary to apply subparagraph (A)(ii) to devises of trust or restricted land under the jurisdiction of the Indian tribe, the interest may be devised in fee in accordance with subparagraph (A)(ii).
<br>(II) Effect
<br>
<br>Subclause (I) shall apply with respect to a devise of a trust or restricted interest in land by any decedent who dies on or after the date on which the applicable Indian tribe adopts the resolution, law, or other enactment described in subclause (I), regardless of the date on which the devise is made.

<br>(C) Maintenance as trust personalty
<br>
<br>In the case of a devise of an interest in trust personalty to a person or Indian tribe eligible to be a devisee under paragraph (1)(A), the Secretary shall maintain and continue to manage such interests as trust personalty.
