<br>
<br>Section 506, referred to in subsec. (b), means section 506 of Pub. L. 93–415, which was formerly section 505 of the Act prior to renumbering by Pub. L. 115–385, and was classified to section 5784 of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare, prior to omission from the Code. After renumbering section 505 as 506, Pub. L. 115–385 went on to add a new section 505 of the Act and then repeal "section 505", which was executed by repealing section 506 as renumbered, to reflect the probable intent of Congress. A new section relating to authorization of appropriations was enacted by Pub. L. 115–385 as section 601 of Pub. L. 93–415 and is classified to section 11321 of this title.
