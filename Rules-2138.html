<br>(A) assume that the frequency will be assigned by the Commission under section 303 of the 1934 Act (47 U.S.C. 303) within 15 years;
<br>
<br>(B) assume reasonable rates of scientific progress and growth of demand for telecommunications services;
<br>
<br>(C) seek to include frequencies which can be used to stimulate the development of new technologies; and
<br>
<br>(D) consider the immediate and recurring costs to reestablish services displaced by the reallocation of spectrum.
<br>(3) Analysis of benefits
<br>
<br>In determining whether a band of frequencies meets the criteria specified in subsection (a)(5), the Secretary shall consider—
<br>
<br>(A) the extent to which equipment is or will be available that is capable of utilizing the band;
<br>
<br>(B) the proximity of frequencies that are already assigned for commercial or other non-Federal use;
<br>
<br>(C) the extent to which, in general, commercial users could share the frequency with amateur radio licensees; and
<br>
<br>(D) the activities of foreign governments in making frequencies available for experimentation or commercial assignments in order to support their domestic manufacturers of equipment.
<br>(4) Power agency frequencies
<br>(A) Applicability of criteria
<br>
<br>The criteria specified by subsection (a) shall be deemed not to be met for any purpose under this subchapter with regard to any frequency assignment to, or any frequency assignment used by, a Federal power agency for the purpose of withdrawing that assignment.
<br>(B) Mixed use eligibility
<br>
<br>The frequencies assigned to any Federal power agency may only be eligible for mixed use under subsection (b)(2) in geographically separate areas, but in those cases where a frequency is to be shared by an affected Federal power agency and a non-Federal user, such use by the non-Federal user shall not cause harmful interference to the affected Federal power agency or adversely affect the reliability of its power system.
<br>(C) "Federal power agency" defined
<br>
<br>As used in this paragraph, the term "Federal power agency" means the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Bonneville Power Administration, the Western Area Power Administration, the Southwestern Power Administration, the Southeastern Power Administration, or the Alaska Power Administration.
<br>(5) Limitation on reallocation
<br>
<br>None of the frequencies recommended for reallocation in the reports required by this subsection shall have been recommended, prior to August 10, 1993, for reallocation to non-Federal use by international agreement.
<br>(d) Procedure for identification of reallocable bands of frequencies
<br>(1) Submission of preliminary identification to Congress
<br>
<br>Within 6 months after August 10, 1993, the Secretary shall prepare, make publicly available, and submit to the President, the Congress, and the Commission a report which makes a preliminary identification of reallocable bands of frequencies which meet the criteria established by this section.
<br>(2) Public comment
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall provide interested persons with the opportunity to submit, within 90 days after the date of its publication, written comment on the preliminary report required by paragraph (1). The Secretary shall immediately transmit a copy of any such comment to the Commission.
<br>(3) Comment and recommendations from Commission
<br>
<br>The Commission shall, within 90 days after the conclusion of the period for comment provided pursuant to paragraph (2), submit to the Secretary the Commission's analysis of such comments and the Commission's recommendations for responses to such comments, together with such other comments and recommendations as the Commission deems appropriate.
<br>(4) Direct discussions
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall encourage and provide opportunity for direct discussions among commercial representatives and Federal Government users of the spectrum to aid the Secretary in determining which frequencies to recommend for reallocation. The Secretary shall provide notice to the public and the Commission of any such discussions, including the name or names of any businesses or other persons represented in such discussions. A representative of the Commission (and of the Secretary at the election of the Secretary) shall be permitted to attend any such discussions. The Secretary shall provide the public and the Commission with an opportunity to comment on the results of any such discussions prior to the submission of the initial report required by subsection (a).
<br>(e) Timetable for reallocation and limitation
<br>(1) Timetable required
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall, as part of the reports required by subsections (a) and (d)(1), include a timetable that recommends effective dates by which the President shall withdraw or limit assignments of the frequencies specified in such reports.
<br>(2) Expedited reallocation
<br>(A) Required reallocation
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall, as part of the report required by subsection (d)(1), specifically identify and recommend for immediate reallocation bands of frequencies that in the aggregate span not less than 50 megahertz, that meet the criteria described in subsection (a), and that can be made available for reallocation immediately upon issuance of the report required by subsection (d)(1). Such bands of frequencies shall include bands of frequencies, located below 3 gigahertz, that in the aggregate span not less than 25 megahertz.
<br>(B) Permitted reallocation
<br>
<br>The Secretary may, as part of such report, identify and recommend bands of frequencies for immediate reallocation for a mixed use pursuant to subsection (b)(2), but such bands of frequencies may not count toward the minimums required by subparagraph (A).
<br>(3) Delayed effective dates
<br>
<br>In setting the recommended delayed effective dates, the Secretary shall—
<br>
<br>(A) consider the need to reallocate bands of frequencies as early as possible, taking into account the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 925(b) of this title;
<br>
<br>(B) be based on the useful remaining life of equipment that has been purchased or contracted for to operate on identified frequencies;
<br>
<br>(C) consider the need to coordinate frequency use with other nations; and
<br>
<br>(D) take into account the relationship between the costs to the Federal Government of changing to different frequencies and the benefits that may be obtained from commercial and other non-Federal uses of the reassigned frequencies.
<br>(f) Additional reallocation report
<br>
<br>If the Secretary receives a notice from the Commission pursuant to section 3002(c)(5) of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the Secretary shall prepare and submit to the President, the Commission, and the Congress a report recommending for reallocation for use other than by Federal Government stations under section 305 of the 1934 Act (47 U.S.C. 305), bands of frequencies that are suitable for the licensees identified in the Commission's notice. The Commission shall, not later than one year after receipt of such report, prepare, submit to the President and the Congress, and implement, a plan for the immediate allocation and assignment of such frequencies under the 1934 Act [47 U.S.C. 151 et seq.] to incumbent licensees described in the Commission's notice.
<br>(g) Relocation of and spectrum sharing by Federal Government stations
<br>(1) Eligible Federal entities
<br>
<br>Any Federal entity that operates a Federal Government station that incurs relocation or sharing costs because of planning for an auction of eligible spectrum frequencies or the reallocation of eligible spectrum frequencies from Federal use to exclusive non-Federal use or to shared use shall receive payment for such relocation or sharing costs from the Spectrum Relocation Fund, in accordance with this section and section 928 of this title. For purposes of this paragraph, Federal power agencies exempted under subsection (c)(4) that choose to relocate from the frequencies identified for reallocation pursuant to subsection (a) are eligible to receive payment under this paragraph.
<br>(2) Eligible frequencies
<br>
<br>The bands of eligible frequencies for purposes of this section are as follows:
<br>
<br>(A) the 216–220 megahertz band, the 1432–1435 megahertz band, the 1710–1755 megahertz band, and the 2385–2390 megahertz band of frequencies; and
<br>
<br>(B) any other band of frequencies reallocated from Federal use to non-Federal use or to shared use after January 1, 2003, that is assigned by competitive bidding pursuant to section 309(j) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 309(j)).
<br>(3) Relocation or sharing costs defined
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section and section 928 of this title, the term "relocation or sharing costs" means the costs incurred by a Federal entity in connection with the auction of spectrum frequencies or the sharing of spectrum frequencies (including the auction or a planned auction of the rights to use spectrum frequencies on a shared basis with such entity) in order to achieve comparable capability of systems as before the relocation or sharing arrangement. Such term includes, with respect to relocation or sharing, as the case may be—
<br>
<br>(i) the costs of any modification or replacement of equipment, spares, associated ancillary equipment, software, facilities, operating manuals, training, or compliance with regulations that are attributable to relocation or sharing;
<br>
<br>(ii) the costs of all engineering, equipment, software, site acquisition, and construction, as well as any legitimate and prudent transaction expense, including term-limited Federal civil servant and contractor staff necessary to carry out the relocation or sharing activities of a Federal entity, and reasonable additional costs incurred by the Federal entity that are attributable to relocation or sharing, including increased recurring costs associated with the replacement of facilities;
<br>
<br>(iii) the costs of research, engineering studies, economic analyses, or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with—
<br>
<br>(I) calculating the estimated relocation or sharing costs that are provided to the Commission pursuant to paragraph (4)(A);
<br>
<br>(II) determining the technical or operational feasibility of relocation to 1 or more potential relocation bands; or
<br>
<br>(III) planning for or managing a relocation or sharing arrangement (including spectrum coordination with auction winners);
<br>
<br>(iv) the one-time costs of any modification of equipment reasonably necessary—
<br>
<br>(I) to accommodate non-Federal use of shared frequencies; or
<br>
<br>(II) in the case of eligible frequencies reallocated for exclusive non-Federal use and assigned through a system of competitive bidding under section 309(j) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 309(j)) but with respect to which a Federal entity retains primary allocation or protected status for a period of time after the completion of the competitive bidding process, to accommodate shared Federal and non-Federal use of such frequencies for such period; and
<br>
<br>(v) the costs associated with the accelerated replacement of systems and equipment if the acceleration is necessary to ensure the timely relocation of systems to a new frequency assignment or the timely accommodation of sharing of Federal frequencies.
<br>(B) Comparable capability of systems
<br>
<br>For purposes of subparagraph (A), comparable capability of systems—
<br>
<br>(i) may be achieved by relocating a Federal Government station to a new frequency assignment, by relocating a Federal Government station to a different geographic location, by modifying Federal Government equipment to mitigate interference or use less spectrum, in terms of bandwidth, geography, or time, and thereby permitting spectrum sharing (including sharing among relocated Federal entities and incumbents to make spectrum available for non-Federal use) or relocation, or by utilizing an alternative technology; and
<br>
<br>(ii) includes the acquisition of state-of-the-art replacement systems intended to meet comparable operational scope, which may include incidental increases in functionality.
<br>(4) Notice to Commission of estimated relocation or sharing costs
<br>
<br>(A) The Commission shall notify the NTIA at least 18 months prior to the commencement of any auction of eligible frequencies defined in paragraph (2). At least 6 months prior to the commencement of any such auction, the NTIA, on behalf of the Federal entities and after review by the Office of Management and Budget, shall notify the Commission of estimated relocation or sharing costs and timelines for such relocation or sharing.
<br>
<br>(B) Upon timely request of a Federal entity, the NTIA shall provide such entity with information regarding an alternative frequency assignment or assignments to which their radiocommunications operations could be relocated for purposes of calculating the estimated relocation or sharing costs and timelines to be submitted to the Commission pursuant to subparagraph (A).
<br>
<br>(C) To the extent practicable and consistent with national security considerations, the NTIA shall provide the information required by subparagraphs (A) and (B) by the geographic location of the Federal entities' facilities or systems and the frequency bands used by such facilities or systems.
<br>(5) Notice to congressional committees and GAO
<br>
<br>The NTIA shall, at the time of providing an initial estimate of relocation or sharing costs to the Commission under paragraph (4)(A), submit to 1 Committees on Appropriations and Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives for approval, to the Committees on Appropriations and Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate for approval, and to the Comptroller General a copy of such estimate and the timelines for relocation or sharing. Unless disapproved within 30 days, the estimate shall be approved. If disapproved, the NTIA may resubmit a revised initial estimate.
<br>(6) Implementation of procedures
<br>
<br>The NTIA shall take such actions as necessary to ensure the timely relocation of Federal entities' spectrum-related operations from frequencies described in paragraph (2) to frequencies or facilities of comparable capability and to ensure the timely implementation of arrangements for the sharing of frequencies described in such paragraph. Upon a finding by the NTIA that a Federal entity has achieved comparable capability of systems, the NTIA shall terminate or limit the entity's authorization and notify the Commission that the entity's relocation has been completed or sharing arrangement has been implemented. The NTIA shall also terminate such entity's authorization if the NTIA determines that the entity has unreasonably failed to comply with the timeline for relocation or sharing submitted by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget under section 928(d)(2)(C) of this title.
<br>(h) Development and publication of relocation or sharing transition plans
<br>(1) Development of transition plan by Federal entity

<br>§924. Withdrawal or limitation of assignment to Federal Government stations
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>The President shall—
<br>
<br>(1) within 6 months after receipt of a report by the Secretary under subsection (a), (d)(1), or (f) of section 923 of this title, withdraw the assignment to a Federal Government station of any frequency which the report recommends for immediate reallocation;
<br>
<br>(2) within any such 6-month period, limit the assignment to a Federal Government station of any frequency which the report recommends be made immediately available for mixed use under section 923(b)(2) of this title;
<br>
<br>(3) by the delayed effective date recommended by the Secretary under section 923(e) of this title (except as provided in subsection (b)(4) of this section), withdraw or limit the assignment to a Federal Government station of any frequency which the report recommends be reallocated or made available for mixed use on such delayed effective date;
<br>
<br>(4) assign or reassign other frequencies to Federal Government stations as necessary to adjust to such withdrawal or limitation of assignments; and
<br>
<br>(5) transmit a notice and description to the Commission and each House of Congress of the actions taken under this subsection.
<br>(b) Exceptions
<br>(1) Authority to substitute
<br>
<br>If the President determines that a circumstance described in paragraph (2) exists, the President—
<br>
<br>(A) may substitute an alternative frequency or frequencies for the frequency that is subject to such determination and withdraw (or limit) the assignment of that alternative frequency in the manner required by subsection (a); and
<br>
<br>(B) shall submit a statement of the reasons for taking the action described in subparagraph (A) to the Commission, Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives, and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate.
<br>(2) Grounds for substitution
<br>
<br>For purposes of paragraph (1), the following circumstances are described in this paragraph:
<br>
<br>(A) the reassignment would seriously jeopardize the national defense interests of the United States;
<br>
<br>(B) the frequency proposed for reassignment is uniquely suited to meeting important governmental needs;
<br>
<br>(C) the reassignment would seriously jeopardize public health or safety;
<br>
<br>(D) the reassignment will result in costs to the Federal Government that are excessive in relation to the benefits that may be obtained from commercial or other non-Federal uses of the reassigned frequency; or
<br>
<br>(E) the reassignment will disrupt the existing use of a Federal Government band of frequencies by amateur radio licensees.
<br>(3) Criteria for substituted frequencies
<br>
<br>For purposes of paragraph (1), a frequency may not be substituted for a frequency identified and recommended by the report of the Secretary under section 923(a) of this title unless the substituted frequency also meets each of the criteria specified by section 923(a) of this title.
<br>(4) Delays in implementation
<br>
<br>If the President determines that any action cannot be completed by the delayed effective date recommended by the Secretary pursuant to section 923(e) of this title, or that such an action by such date would result in a frequency being unused as a consequence of the Commission's plan under section 925 of this title, the President may—
<br>
<br>(A) withdraw or limit the assignment to Federal Government stations on a later date that is consistent with such plan, except that the President shall notify each committee specified in paragraph (1)(B) and the Commission of the reason that withdrawal or limitation at a later date is required; or
<br>
<br>(B) substitute alternative frequencies pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.

<br>Commission Obligation To Make Additional Spectrum Available by Auction
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 105–33, title III, §3002(c), Aug. 5, 1997, 111 Stat. 261, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(1) In general.—The Commission shall complete all actions necessary to permit the assignment by September 30, 2002, by competitive bidding pursuant to section 309(j) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 309(j)), of licenses for the use of bands of frequencies that—
<br>
<br>"(A) in the aggregate span not less than 55 megahertz;
<br>
<br>"(B) are located below 3 gigahertz;
<br>
<br>"(C) have not, as of the date of enactment of this Act [Aug. 5, 1997]—
<br>
<br>"(i) been designated by Commission regulation for assignment pursuant to such section;
<br>
<br>"(ii) been identified by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to section 113 of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act (47 U.S.C. 923);
<br>
<br>"(iii) been allocated for Federal Government use pursuant to section 305 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 305);
<br>
<br>"(iv) been designated for reallocation under section 337 of the Communications Act of 1934 [47 U.S.C. 337] (as added by this Act); or
<br>
<br>"(v) been allocated or authorized for unlicensed use pursuant to part 15 of the Commission's regulations (47 C.F.R. Part 15), if the operation of services licensed pursuant to competitive bidding would interfere with operation of end-user products permitted under such regulations;
<br>
<br>"(D) include frequencies at 2,110–2,150 megahertz; and
<br>
<br>"(E) include 15 megahertz from within the bands of frequencies at 1,990–2,110 megahertz.
<br>
<br>"(2) Criteria for Reassignment.—In making available bands of frequencies for competitive bidding pursuant to paragraph (1), the Commission shall—
<br>
<br>"(A) seek to promote the most efficient use of the electromagnetic spectrum;
<br>
<br>"(B) consider the cost of relocating existing uses to other bands of frequencies or other means of communication;
<br>
<br>"(C) consider the needs of existing public safety radio services (as such services are described in section 309(j)(2)(A) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended by this Act);
<br>
<br>"(D) comply with the requirements of international agreements concerning spectrum allocations; and
<br>
<br>"(E) coordinate with the Secretary of Commerce when there is any impact on Federal Government spectrum use.
<br>
<br>"(3) Use of bands at 2,110–2,150 megahertz.—The Commission shall reallocate spectrum located at 2,110–2,150 megahertz for assignment by competitive bidding unless the Commission determines that auction of other spectrum (A) better serves the public interest, convenience, and necessity, and (B) can reasonably be expected to produce greater receipts. If the Commission makes such a determination, then the Commission shall, within 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act [Aug. 5, 1997], identify an alternative 40 megahertz, and report to the Congress an identification of such alternative 40 megahertz for assignment by competitive bidding.
<br>
<br>"(4) Use of 15 megahertz from bands at 1,990–2,110 megahertz.—The Commission shall reallocate 15 megahertz from spectrum located at 1,990–2,110 megahertz for assignment by competitive bidding unless the President determines such spectrum cannot be reallocated due to the need to protect incumbent Federal systems from interference, and that allocation of other spectrum (A) better serves the public interest, convenience, and necessity, and (B) can reasonably be expected to produce comparable receipts. If the President makes such a determination, then the President shall, within 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act, identify alternative bands of frequencies totalling 15 megahertz, and report to the Congress an identification of such alternative bands for assignment by competitive bidding.
<br>
<br>"(5) Notification to the Secretary of Commerce.—The Commission shall attempt to accommodate incumbent licensees displaced under this section by relocating them to other frequencies available for allocation by the Commission. The Commission shall notify the Secretary of Commerce whenever the Commission is not able to provide for the effective relocation of an incumbent licensee to a band of frequencies available to the Commission for assignment. The notification shall include—
<br>
<br>"(A) specific information on the incumbent licensee;
<br>
<br>"(B) the bands the Commission considered for relocation of the licensee;
<br>
<br>"(C) the reasons the licensee cannot be accommodated in such bands; and
<br>
<br>"(D) the bands of frequencies identified by the Commission that are—
<br>
<br>"(i) suitable for the relocation of such licensee; and
<br>
<br>"(ii) allocated for Federal Government use, but that could be reallocated pursuant to part B of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act (as amended by this Act) [part B (§§131–135) of title I of Pub. L. 102–538, see Tables for classification]."
<br>§926. Authority to recover reassigned frequencies

<br>
<br>Any amounts in the Fund that are remaining after the payment of the relocation or sharing costs that are payable from the Fund shall revert to and be deposited in the general fund of the Treasury, for the sole purpose of deficit reduction, not later than 8 years after the date of the deposit of such proceeds to the Fund, unless within 60 days in advance of the reversion of such funds, the Director of OMB, in consultation with the NTIA, notifies the congressional committees described in paragraph (2)(C) that such funds are needed to complete or to implement current or future relocation or sharing arrangements.
<br>(e) Transfer to eligible Federal entities
<br>(1) Transfer
<br>
<br>(A) Amounts made available pursuant to subsection (d) shall be transferred to eligible Federal entities, as defined in section 923(g)(1) of this title.
<br>
<br>(B) An eligible Federal entity may receive more than one such transfer, but if the sum of the subsequent transfer or transfers exceeds 10 percent of the original transfer—
<br>
<br>(i) such subsequent transfers are subject to prior approval by the Director of OMB as required by subsection (d)(2)(B);
<br>
<br>(ii) the notice to the committees containing the plan required by subsection (d)(2)(C) shall be not less than 45 days prior to the date of the transfer that causes such excess above 10 percent; and
<br>
<br>(iii) such notice shall include, in addition to such plan, an explanation of need for such subsequent transfer or transfers.
<br>
<br>(C) Such transferred amounts shall be credited to the appropriations account of the eligible Federal entity which has incurred, or will incur, such costs, and shall, subject to paragraph (2), remain available until expended.
<br>
<br>(D) At the request of an eligible Federal entity, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (in this subsection referred to as "OMB") may transfer the amount under subparagraph (A) immediately—
<br>
<br>(i) after the frequencies are reallocated by competitive bidding under section 309(j) of this title; or
<br>
<br>(ii) in the case of an incumbent Federal entity that is incurring relocation or sharing costs to accommodate sharing spectrum frequencies with another Federal entity, after the frequencies from which the other eligible Federal entity is relocating are reallocated by competitive bidding under section 309(j) of this title, without regard to the availability of such sums in the Fund.
<br>
<br>(E) Prior to the deposit of proceeds into the Fund from an auction, the Director of OMB may borrow from the Treasury the amount under subparagraph (A) for a transfer under subparagraph (D). The Treasury shall immediately be reimbursed, without interest, from funds deposited into the Fund.
<br>(2) Retransfer to fund
<br>
<br>An eligible Federal entity that has received such amounts shall report its expenditures to OMB and shall transfer any amounts in excess of actual relocation or sharing costs back to the Fund immediately after the NTIA has notified the Commission that the relocation of the entity or implementation of the sharing arrangement by the entity is complete, or has determined that such entity has unreasonably failed to complete such relocation or the implementation of such arrangement in accordance with the timeline required by subsection (d)(2)(B).
<br>(f) Additional payments from Fund

<br>(B) Conditions
<br>
<br>In the case of any payment by the Director of OMB under subparagraph (A)—
<br>
<br>(i) such payment shall be based on the market value of the eligible frequencies, the timeliness with which the eligible Federal entity clears its use of such frequencies, and the need for such frequencies in order for the entity to conduct its essential missions;
<br>
<br>(ii) the eligible Federal entity shall use such payment for the purposes specified in clauses (i) through (v) of section 923(g)(3)(A) of this title to achieve comparable capability of systems affected by the reallocation of eligible frequencies from Federal use to exclusive non-Federal use or to shared use;
<br>
<br>(iii) such payment may not be made if the amount remaining in the Fund after such payment will be less than 10 percent of the winning bids in the auction of the spectrum with respect to which the Federal entity is incurring relocation or sharing costs; and
<br>
<br>(iv) such payment may not be made until 30 days after the Director of OMB has notified the congressional committees described in subsection (d)(2)(C).

<br>
<br>The Director of OMB may use amounts made available under paragraph (1) to make payments requested by Federal entities for research and development, engineering studies, economic analyses, activities with respect to systems, or other planning activities intended to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the spectrum use of Federal entities in order to make available frequencies described in subparagraph (C) for reallocation for non-Federal use or shared Federal and non-Federal use, or a combination thereof, and for auction in accordance with such reallocation.
<br>(B) Systems that improve efficiency and effectiveness of Federal spectrum use
<br>
<br>For purposes of a payment under subparagraph (A) for activities with respect to systems that improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the spectrum use of Federal entities, such systems include the following:
<br>
<br>(i) Systems that have increased functionality or that increase the ability of a Federal entity to accommodate spectrum sharing with non-Federal entities.

<br>Statutory Notes and Related Subsidiaries
<br>Findings and Purposes
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 107–317, §2, Dec. 4, 2002, 116 Stat. 2766, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(a) Findings.—The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>"(1) the World Wide Web presents a stimulating and entertaining opportunity for children to learn, grow, and develop educationally and intellectually;
<br>
<br>"(2) Internet technology also makes available an extensive amount of information that is harmful to children, as studies indicate that a significant portion of all material available on the Internet is related to pornography;
<br>
<br>"(3) young children, when trying to use the World Wide Web for positive purposes, are often presented—either mistakenly or intentionally—with material that is inappropriate for their age, which can be extremely frustrating for children, parents, and educators;
<br>
<br>"(4) exposure of children to material that is inappropriate for them, including pornography, can distort the education and development of the Nation's youth and represents a serious harm to American families that can lead to a host of other problems for children, including inappropriate use of chat rooms, physical molestation, harassment, and legal and financial difficulties;
<br>
<br>"(5) young boys and girls, older teens, troubled youth, frequent Internet users, chat room participants, online risk takers, and those who communicate online with strangers are at greater risk for receiving unwanted sexual solicitation on the Internet;
<br>
<br>"(6) studies have shown that 19 percent of youth (ages 10 to 17) who used the Internet regularly were the targets of unwanted sexual solicitation, but less than 10 percent of the solicitations were reported to the police;
<br>
<br>"(7) children who come across illegal content should report it to the congressionally authorized CyberTipline, an online mechanism developed by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, for citizens to report sexual crimes against children;
<br>
<br>"(8) the CyberTipline has received more than 64,400 reports, including reports of child pornography, online enticement for sexual acts, child molestation (outside the family), and child prostitution;
<br>
<br>"(9) although the computer software and hardware industries, and other related industries, have developed innovative ways to help parents and educators restrict material that is harmful to minors through parental control protections and self-regulation, to date such efforts have not provided a national solution to the problem of minors accessing harmful material on the World Wide Web;
<br>
<br>"(10) the creation of a 'green-light' area within the United States country code Internet domain, that will contain only content that is appropriate for children under the age of 13, is analogous to the creation of a children's section within a library and will promote the positive experiences of children and families in the United States; and
<br>
<br>"(11) while custody, care, and nurture of the child reside first with the parent, the protection of the physical and psychological well-being of minors by shielding them from material that is harmful to them is a compelling governmental interest.
<br>
<br>"(b) Purposes.—The purposes of this Act [see Short Title of 2002 Amendment note set out under section 901 of this title] are—
<br>
