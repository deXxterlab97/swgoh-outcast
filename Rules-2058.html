<br>
<br>(F) indicates for each recordkeeping requirement the length of time persons are required to maintain the records specified;
<br>
<br>(G) contains the statement required under paragraph (1)(B)(iii);

<br>
<br>(I) uses effective and efficient statistical survey methodology appropriate to the purpose for which the information is to be collected; and
<br>
<br>(J) to the maximum extent practicable, uses information technology to reduce burden and improve data quality, agency efficiency and responsiveness to the public; and

<br>(4) in addition to the requirements of this chapter regarding the reduction of information collection burdens for small business concerns (as defined in section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632)), make efforts to further reduce the information collection burden for small business concerns with fewer than 25 employees.
<br>
<br>(d) With respect to information dissemination, each agency shall—

<br>
<br>(A) encouraging a diversity of public and private sources for information based on government public information;
<br>
<br>(B) in cases in which the agency provides public information maintained in electronic format, providing timely and equitable access to the underlying data (in whole or in part); and
<br>
<br>(C) agency dissemination of public information in an efficient, effective, and economical manner;
<br>
<br>(2) regularly solicit and consider public input on the agency's information dissemination activities;
<br>
<br>(3) provide adequate notice when initiating, substantially modifying, or terminating significant information dissemination products;

<br>Executive Documents
<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13073. Year 2000 Conversion
<br>
<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13073, Feb. 4, 1998, 63 F.R. 6467, as amended by Ex. Ord. No. 13127, June 14, 1999, 64 F.R. 32793, provided:
<br>
<br>The American people expect reliable service from their Government and deserve the confidence that critical government functions dependent on electronic systems will be performed accurately and in a timely manner. Because of a design feature in many electronic systems, a large number of activities in the public and private sectors could be at risk beginning in the year 2000. Some computer systems and other electronic devices will misinterpret the year "00" as 1900, rather than 2000. Unless appropriate action is taken, this flaw, known as the "Y2K problem," can cause systems that support those functions to compute erroneously or simply not run. Minimizing the Y2K problem will require a major technological and managerial effort, and it is critical that the United States Government do its part in addressing this challenge.
<br>
<br>Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:
<br>
<br>Section 1. Policy. (a) It shall be the policy of the executive branch that agencies shall:
<br>
<br>(1) assure that no critical Federal program experiences disruption because of the Y2K problem;
<br>
<br>(2) assist and cooperate with State, local, and tribal governments to address the Y2K problem where those governments depend on Federal information or information technology or the Federal Government is dependent on those governments to perform critical missions;
<br>
<br>(3) cooperate with the private sector operators of critical national and local systems, including the banking and financial system, the telecommunications system, the public health system, the transportation system, and the electric power generation system, in addressing the Y2K problem; and
<br>
<br>(4) communicate with their foreign counterparts to raise awareness of and generate cooperative international arrangements to address the Y2K problem.
<br>
<br>(b) As used in this order, "agency" and "agencies" refer to Federal agencies that are not in the judicial or legislative branches.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. Year 2000 Conversion Council. There is hereby established the President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion (the "Council").
<br>
<br>(a) The Council shall be led by a Chair who shall be an Assistant to the President, and it shall be composed of one representative from each of the executive departments and from such other Federal agencies as may be determined by the Chair of the Council (the "Chair").
<br>
<br>(b) The Chair shall appoint a Vice Chair and assign other responsibilities for operations of the council as he or she deems necessary.
<br>
<br>(c) The Chair shall oversee the activities of agencies to assure that their systems operate smoothly through the year 2000, act as chief spokesperson on this issue for the executive branch in national and international fora, provide policy coordination of executive branch activities with State, local, and tribal governments on the Y2K problem, and promote appropriate Federal roles with respect to private sector activities in this area.
<br>
<br>(d) The Chair and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall report jointly at least quarterly to me on the progress of agencies in addressing the Y2K problem.
<br>
<br>(e) The Chair shall identify such resources from agencies as the Chair deems necessary for the implementation of the policies set out in this order, consistent with applicable law.
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. Responsibilities of Agency Heads. (a) The head of each agency shall:
<br>
<br>(1) assure that efforts to address the Y2K problem receive the highest priority attention in the agency and that the policies established in this order are carried out; and
<br>
<br>(2) cooperate to the fullest extent with the Chair by making available such information, support, and assistance, including personnel, as the Chair may request to support the accomplishment of the tasks assigned herein, consistent with applicable law.
<br>
<br>(b) The heads of executive departments and the agencies designated by the Chair under section 2(a) of this order shall identify a responsible official to represent the head of the executive department or agency on the Council with sufficient authority and experience to commit agency resources to address the Y2K problem.
<br>
<br>Sec. 4. Responsibilities of Interagency and Executive Office Councils. Interagency councils and councils within the Executive Office of the President, including the President's Management Council, the Chief Information Officers Council, the Chief Financial Officers Council, the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency, the Executive Council on Integrity and Efficiency, the National Science and Technology Council, the National Performance Review, the National Economic Council, the Domestic Policy Council, and the National Security Council shall provide assistance and support to the Chair upon the Chair's request.
<br>
<br>Sec. 5. Information Coordination Center. (a) To assist the Chair in the Y2K response duties included under section 2(c) of this order, there shall be established the Information Coordination Center (ICC) in the General Services Administration.
<br>
<br>(b) At the direction of the Chair, the ICC will assist in making preparations for information sharing and coordination within the Federal Government and key components of the public and private sectors, coordinating agency assessments of Y2K emergencies that could have an adverse affect on U.S. interests at home and abroad, and, if necessary, assisting Federal agencies and the Chair in reconstitution processes where appropriate.
<br>
<br>(c) The ICC will:
<br>
<br>(1) consist of officials from executive agencies, designated by agency heads under subsection 3(a)(2) of this order, who have expertise in important management and technical areas, computer hardware, software or security systems, reconstitution and recovery, and of additional personnel hired directly or by contract, as required, to carry out the duties described under section 5 of this order;
<br>
<br>(2) work with the Council and the Office of Management and Budget to assure that Federal efforts to restore critical systems are coordinated with efforts managed by Federal agencies acting under existing emergency response authorities.
<br>
<br>(d) The Chair of the President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion shall designate a Director of the ICC.
<br>
<br>Sec. 6. Judicial Review. This Executive order is intended only to improve the internal management of the executive branch and does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity by a party against the United States, its agencies, or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person.

<br>(A) how any collection of information contained in the final rule responds to the comments, if any, filed by the Director or the public; or
<br>
<br>(B) the reasons such comments were rejected.
<br>
<br>(3) If the Director has received notice and failed to comment on an agency rule within 60 days after the notice of proposed rulemaking, the Director may not disapprove any collection of information specifically contained in an agency rule.
<br>
<br>(4) No provision in this section shall be construed to prevent the Director, in the Director's discretion—
<br>
<br>(A) from disapproving any collection of information which was not specifically required by an agency rule;
<br>
<br>(B) from disapproving any collection of information contained in an agency rule, if the agency failed to comply with the requirements of paragraph (1) of this subsection;
<br>
<br>(C) from disapproving any collection of information contained in a final agency rule, if the Director finds within 60 days after the publication of the final rule that the agency's response to the Director's comments filed under paragraph (2) of this subsection was unreasonable; or
<br>
<br>(D) from disapproving any collection of information contained in a final rule, if—
<br>
<br>(i) the Director determines that the agency has substantially modified in the final rule the collection of information contained in the proposed rule; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the agency has not given the Director the information required under paragraph (1) with respect to the modified collection of information, at least 60 days before the issuance of the final rule.
<br>
<br>(5) This subsection shall apply only when an agency publishes a notice of proposed rulemaking and requests public comments.
<br>
<br>(6) The decision by the Director to approve or not act upon a collection of information contained in an agency rule shall not be subject to judicial review.
<br>
<br>(e)(1) Any decision by the Director under subsection (c), (d), (h), or (j) to disapprove a collection of information, or to instruct the agency to make substantive or material change to a collection of information, shall be publicly available and include an explanation of the reasons for such decision.
<br>
<br>(2) Any written communication between the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, or any employee of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, and an agency or person not employed by the Federal Government concerning a proposed collection of information shall be made available to the public.
<br>
<br>(3) This subsection shall not require the disclosure of—
<br>
<br>(A) any information which is protected at all times by procedures established for information which has been specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order or an Act of Congress to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy; or
<br>
<br>(B) any communication relating to a collection of information which is not approved under this subchapter, the disclosure of which could lead to retaliation or discrimination against the communicator.
<br>
<br>(f)(1) An independent regulatory agency which is administered by 2 or more members of a commission, board, or similar body, may by majority vote void—
<br>
<br>(A) any disapproval by the Director, in whole or in part, of a proposed collection of information of that agency; or
<br>
<br>(B) an exercise of authority under subsection (d) of section 3507 concerning that agency.
<br>
<br>(2) The agency shall certify each vote to void such disapproval or exercise to the Director, and explain the reasons for such vote. The Director shall without further delay assign a control number to such collection of information, and such vote to void the disapproval or exercise shall be valid for a period of 3 years.
<br>
<br>(g) The Director may not approve a collection of information for a period in excess of 3 years.

<br>(A) conduct the review established under section 3506(c), including the seeking of comment from the public on the continued need for, and burden imposed by the collection of information; and
<br>
<br>(B) after having made a reasonable effort to seek public comment, but no later than 60 days before the expiration date of the control number assigned by the Director for the currently approved collection of information, submit the collection of information for review and approval under this section, which shall include an explanation of how the agency has used the information that it has collected.
<br>
<br>(2) If under the provisions of this section, the Director disapproves a collection of information contained in an existing rule, or recommends or instructs the agency to make a substantive or material change to a collection of information contained in an existing rule, the Director shall—
<br>
<br>(A) publish an explanation thereof in the Federal Register; and
<br>
<br>(B) instruct the agency to undertake a rulemaking within a reasonable time limited to consideration of changes to the collection of information contained in the rule and thereafter to submit the collection of information for approval or disapproval under this subchapter.
<br>
<br>(3) An agency may not make a substantive or material modification to a collection of information after such collection has been approved by the Director, unless the modification has been submitted to the Director for review and approval under this subchapter.
<br>
<br>(i)(1) If the Director finds that a senior official of an agency designated under section 3506(a) is sufficiently independent of program responsibility to evaluate fairly whether proposed collections of information should be approved and has sufficient resources to carry out this responsibility effectively, the Director may, by rule in accordance with the notice and comment provisions of chapter 5 of title 5, United States Code, delegate to such official the authority to approve proposed collections of information in specific program areas, for specific purposes, or for all agency purposes.
<br>
<br>(2) A delegation by the Director under this section shall not preclude the Director from reviewing individual collections of information if the Director determines that circumstances warrant such a review. The Director shall retain authority to revoke such delegations, both in general and with regard to any specific matter. In acting for the Director, any official to whom approval authority has been delegated under this section shall comply fully with the rules and regulations promulgated by the Director.
<br>
<br>(j)(1) The agency head may request the Director to authorize a collection of information, if an agency head determines that—
<br>
<br>(A) a collection of information—
<br>
<br>(i) is needed prior to the expiration of time periods established under this subchapter; and
<br>
<br>(ii) is essential to the mission of the agency; and
<br>
<br>(B) the agency cannot reasonably comply with the provisions of this subchapter because—
<br>
<br>(i) public harm is reasonably likely to result if normal clearance procedures are followed;
<br>
<br>(ii) an unanticipated event has occurred; or
<br>
<br>(iii) the use of normal clearance procedures is reasonably likely to prevent or disrupt the collection of information or is reasonably likely to cause a statutory or court ordered deadline to be missed.
<br>
<br>(2) The Director shall approve or disapprove any such authorization request within the time requested by the agency head and, if approved, shall assign the collection of information a control number. Any collection of information conducted under this subsection may be conducted without compliance with the provisions of this subchapter for a maximum of 180 days after the date on which the Director received the request to authorize such collection.

<br>
<br>(1) In general.—In consultation with the Director and in accordance with the guidance established under paragraph (2), the head of each agency shall, to the maximum extent practicable, develop and maintain a comprehensive data inventory that accounts for all data assets created by, collected by, under the control or direction of, or maintained by the agency. The head of each agency shall ensure that such inventory provides a clear and comprehensive understanding of the data assets in the possession of the agency.
<br>
<br>(2) Guidance.—The Director shall establish guidance for agencies to develop and maintain comprehensive data inventories under paragraph (1). Such guidance shall include the following:
<br>
<br>(A) A requirement for the head of an agency to include in the comprehensive data inventory metadata on each data asset of the agency, including, to the maximum extent practicable, the following:

<br>(I) has determined or can determine if the data asset is—
<br>
<br>(aa) an open Government data asset;
<br>
<br>(bb) subject to disclosure or partial disclosure or exempt from disclosure under section 552 of title 5;
<br>
<br>(cc) a public data asset eligible for disclosure under subsection (b); or
<br>
<br>(dd) a data asset not subject to open format or open license requirements due to existing limitations or restrictions on government distribution of the asset; or
<br>
<br>(II) as of the date of such indication, has not made such determination.
<br>
<br>(iv) Any determination made under section 3582, if available.

<br>
<br>(C) Criteria for the head of an agency to use in determining which metadata required by subparagraph (A), if any, in the comprehensive data inventory may not be made publicly available, which shall include, at a minimum, a requirement to ensure all information that could not otherwise be withheld from disclosure under section 552 of title 5 is made public in the comprehensive data inventory.
<br>
<br>(D) A requirement for the head of each agency, in accordance with a procedure established by the Director, to submit for inclusion in the Federal data catalogue maintained under subsection (c) the comprehensive data inventory developed pursuant to subparagraph (C), including any real-time updates to such inventory, and data assets made available in accordance with subparagraph (E) or any electronic hyperlink providing access to such data assets.
<br>
<br>(E) Criteria for the head of an agency to use in determining whether a particular data asset should not be made publicly available in a manner that takes into account—
<br>
<br>(i) risks and restrictions related to the disclosure of personally identifiable information, including the risk that an individual data asset in isolation does not pose a privacy or confidentiality risk but when combined with other available information may pose such a risk;
<br>
<br>(ii) security considerations, including the risk that information in an individual data asset in isolation does not pose a security risk but when combined with other available information may pose such a risk;
<br>
<br>(iii) the cost and benefits to the public of converting the data into a format that could be understood and used by the public;
<br>
<br>(iv) whether the public dissemination of the data asset could result in legal liability;
<br>
<br>(v) whether the data asset—
<br>
<br>(I) is subject to intellectual property rights, including rights under titles 17 and 35;
<br>

<br>
<br>(vii) the expectation that all data assets that would otherwise be made available under section 552 of title 5 be disclosed; and
<br>
<br>(viii) any other considerations that the Director determines to be relevant.
<br>
<br>(F) Criteria for the head of an agency to use in assessing the indication of a determination under subparagraph (A)(iii) and how to prioritize any such subsequent determinations in the strategic information management plan under section 3506, in consideration of the existing resources available to the agency.
<br>
<br>(3) Regular updates required.—With respect to each data asset created or identified by an agency, the head of the agency shall update the comprehensive data inventory of the agency not later than 90 days after the date of such creation or identification.
<br>

<br>
<br>(2) Repository.—The Director shall collaborate with the Office of Government Information Services and the Administrator of General Services to develop and maintain an online repository of tools, best practices, and schema standards to facilitate the adoption of open data practices across the Federal Government, which shall—

<br>(A) include any definitions, regulations, policies, checklists, and case studies related to open data policy;
<br>
<br>(B) facilitate collaboration and the adoption of best practices across the Federal Government relating to the adoption of open data practices; and

<br>
<br>(d) Delegation.—The Director shall delegate to the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs and the Administrator of the Office of Electronic Government the authority to jointly issue guidance required under this section.
