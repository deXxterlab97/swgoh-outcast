<br>§4701. Statement of purpose
<br>
<br>The purpose of this chapter is to establish an undergraduate scholarship program designed to bring students of limited financial means from developing countries to the United States for study at United States institutions of higher education.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 99–93, title VI, §601, Aug. 16, 1985, 99 Stat. 439.)
<br>§4702. Congressional findings and declaration of policy
<br>
<br>The Congress finds and declares that—
<br>
<br>(1) it is in the national interest for the United States Government to provide a stable source of financial support to give students in developing countries the opportunity to study in the United States, in order to improve the range and quality of educational alternatives, increase mutual understanding, and build lasting links between those countries and the United States;
<br>
<br>(2) providing scholarships to foreign students to study in the United States has proven over time to be an effective means of creating strong bonds between the United States and the future leadership of developing countries and, at the same time, assists countries substantially in their development efforts;
<br>
<br>(3) study in United States institutions by foreign students enhances trade and economic relationships by providing strong English language skills and establishing professional and business contacts;
<br>
<br>(4) students from families of limited financial means have, in the past, largely not had the opportunity to study in the United States, and scholarship programs sponsored by the United States have made no provision for identifying, preparing, or supporting such students for study in the United States;
<br>
<br>(5) it is essential that the United States citizenry develop its knowledge and understanding of the developing countries and their languages, cultures, and socioeconomic composition as these areas assume an ever larger role in the world community;
<br>
<br>(6) an undergraduate scholarship program for students of limited financial means from developing countries to study in the United States would complement current assistance efforts in the areas of advanced education and training of people of developing countries in such disciplines as are required for planning and implementation of public and private development activities;
<br>
<br>(7) the National Bipartisan Commission on Central America has recommended a program of 10,000 United States Government-sponsored scholarships to bring Central American students to the United States, which program would involve careful targeting to encourage participation by young people from all social and economic classes, would maintain existing admission standards by providing intensive English and other training, and would encourage graduates to return to their home countries after completing their education; and
<br>
<br>(8) it is also in the interest of the United States, as well as peaceful cooperation in the Western Hemisphere, that particular attention be given to the students of the Caribbean region.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 99–93, title VI, §602, Aug. 16, 1985, 99 Stat. 439; Pub. L. 103–199, title III, §305, Dec. 17, 1993, 107 Stat. 2324.)
<br>
<br>Editorial Notes
<br>Amendments
<br>
<br>1993—Pars. (6) to (10). Pub. L. 103–199 redesignated pars. (8) to (10) as (6) to (8), respectively, and struck out former pars. (6) and (7) which read as follows:
<br>
<br>"(6) the number of United States Government-sponsored scholarships for students in developing countries has been exceeded as much as twelve times in a given year by the number of scholarships offered by Soviet-bloc governments to students in developing countries, and this disparity entails the serious long-run cost of having so many of the potential future leaders of the developing world educated in Soviet-bloc countries;
<br>
<br>"(7) from 1972 through 1982 the Soviet Union and Eastern European governments collectively increased their education exchange programs to Latin America and the Caribbean by 205 percent while those of the United States declined by 52 percent;".
<br>§4703. Scholarship program authority
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>The President, acting through the United States Information Agency, shall provide scholarships (including partial assistance) for undergraduate study at United States institutions of higher education by citizens and nationals of developing countries who have completed their secondary education and who would not otherwise have an opportunity to study in the United States due to financial limitations.
<br>(b) Form of scholarship; forgiveness of loan repayment
<br>
<br>To encourage students to use their training in their countries of origin, each scholarship pursuant to this section shall be in the form of a loan with all repayment to be forgiven upon the student's prompt return to his or her country of origin for a period which is at least one year longer than the period spent studying in the United States. If the student is granted asylum in the United States pursuant to section 1158 of title 8 or is admitted to the United States as a refugee pursuant to section 1157 of title 8, half of the repayment shall be forgiven.
<br>(c) Consultation
<br>
<br>Before allocating any of the funds made available to carry out this chapter, the President shall consult with United States institutions of higher education, educational exchange organizations, United States missions in developing countries, and the governments of participating countries on how to implement the guidelines specified in section 4704 of this title.
<br>(d) "Institution of higher education" defined
<br>
<br>For purposes of this chapter, the term "institution of higher education" has the same meaning as given to such term by section 1001 of title 20.
<br>

<br>
<br>(2) United States missions shall design ways to identify promising students who are in secondary educational institutions, or who have completed their secondary education, for study in the United States. In carrying out this paragraph, the United States mission in a country shall consult with Peace Corps volunteers and staff assigned to that country and with private and voluntary organizations with a proven record of providing development assistance to developing countries.
<br>
<br>(3) United States missions shall develop and strictly implement specific economic need criteria. Scholarships under this chapter may only be provided to students who meet the economic need criteria.
<br>
<br>(4) The program shall utilize educational institutions in the United States and in developing countries to help participants in the programs acquire necessary skills in English and other appropriate education training.
<br>
<br>(5) Each participant from a developing country shall be selected on the basis of academic and leadership potential and the economic, political, and social development needs of such country. Such needs shall be determined by each United States mission in consultation with the government of the respective country. Scholarship opportunities shall emphasize fields that are critical to the development of the participant's country, including agriculture, civil engineering, communications, social science, education, public and business administration, health, nutrition, environmental studies, population and family planning, and energy.
<br>
<br>(6) The program shall be flexible in order to take advantage of different training and educational opportunities offered by universities, postsecondary vocational training schools, and community colleges in the United States.
<br>
<br>(7) The program shall be flexible with respect to the number of years of undergraduate education financed but in no case shall students be brought to the United States for a period less than one year.
<br>
<br>(8) Adequate allowance shall be made in the scholarship for the purchase of books and related educational material relevant to the program of study.
<br>
<br>(9) Further allowance shall be made to provide adequate opportunities for professional, academic, and cultural enrichment for scholarship recipients.
<br>
<br>(10) The program shall, to the maximum extent practicable, offer equal opportunities for both male and female students to study in the United States.
<br>
<br>(11) The United States Information Agency shall recommend to each student, who receives a scholarship under this chapter for study at a college or university, that the student enroll in a course on the classics of American political thought or which otherwise emphasizes the ideas, principles, and documents upon which the United States was founded.

<br>SUBCHAPTER I—GENERALLY
<br>§4801. Findings and purposes
<br>(a) Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds and declares that—
<br>
<br>(1) the United States has a crucial stake in the presence of United States Government personnel representing United States interests abroad;
<br>
<br>(2) conditions confronting United States Government personnel and missions abroad are fraught with security concerns which will continue for the foreseeable future; and
<br>
<br>(3) the resources now available to counter acts of terrorism and protect and secure United States Government personnel and missions abroad, as well as foreign officials and missions in the United States, are inadequate to meet the mounting threat to such personnel and facilities.
<br>(b) Purposes
<br>
<br>The purposes of this chapter are—
<br>
<br>(1) to set forth the responsibility of the Secretary of State with respect to the security of diplomatic operations in the United States and abroad;
<br>
<br>(2) to maximize coordination by the Department of State with Federal, State, and local agencies and agencies of foreign governments in order to enhance security programs;
<br>
<br>(3) to promote strengthened security measures and to provide for the accountability of United States Government personnel with security-related responsibilities;
<br>
<br>(4) to set forth the responsibility of the Secretary of State with respect to the safe and efficient evacuation of United States Government personnel, their dependents, and private United States citizens when their lives are endangered by war, civil unrest, or natural disaster; and
<br>
<br>(5) to provide authorization of appropriations for the Department of State to carry out its responsibilities in the area of security and counterterrorism, and in particular to finance the acquisition and improvements of United States Government missions abroad, including real property, buildings, facilities, and communications, information, and security systems.
