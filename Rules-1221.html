<br>"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
<br>
<br>"This Act may be cited as the 'South African Democratic Transition Support Act of 1993'.
<br>"SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
<br>
<br>"The Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>"(1) After decades of apartheid, South Africa has entered a new era which presents a historic opportunity for a transition to a peaceful, stable, and democratic future.
<br>
<br>"(2) The United States policy of economic sanctions toward the apartheid government of South Africa, as expressed in the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986 [22 U.S.C. 5001 et seq.], helped bring about reforms in that system of government and has facilitated the establishment of a nonracial government.
<br>
<br>"(3) Through broad and open negotiations, the parties in South Africa have reached a landmark agreement on the future of their country. This agreement includes the establishment of a Transitional Executive Council and the setting of a date for nonracial elections.
<br>
<br>"(4) The international community has a vital interest in supporting the transition from apartheid toward nonracial democracy.
<br>
<br>"(5) The success of the transition in South Africa is crucial to the stability and economic development of the southern African region.
<br>
<br>"(6) Nelson Mandela of the African National Congress and other representative leaders in South Africa have declared that the time has come when the international community should lift all economic sanctions against South Africa.
<br>
<br>"(7) In light of recent developments, the continuation of these economic sanctions is detrimental to persons disadvantaged by apartheid.
<br>
<br>"(8) Those calling for the lifting of economic sanctions against South Africa have made clear that they do not seek the immediate termination of the United Nations-sponsored special sanctions relating to arms transfers, nuclear cooperation, and exports of oil. The Ad Hoc Committee on Southern Africa of the Organization of African Unity, for example, has urged that the oil embargo established pursuant to a 1986 General Assembly resolution be lifted after the establishment and commencement of the work of the Transitional Executive Council.
<br>"SEC. 3. UNITED STATES POLICY.
<br>
<br>"It is the sense of the Congress that—
<br>
<br>"(1) the United States should—
<br>
<br>"(A) strongly support the Transitional Executive Council in South Africa,
<br>
<br>"(B) encourage rapid progress toward the establishment of a nonracial democratic government in South Africa, and
<br>
<br>"(C) support a consolidation of democracy in South Africa through democratic elections for an interim government and a new nonracial constitution;
<br>
<br>"(2) the United States should continue to provide assistance to support the transition to a nonracial democracy in South Africa, and should urge international financial institutions and other donors to also provide such assistance;
<br>
<br>"(3) to the maximum extent practicable, the United States should consult closely with international financial institutions, other donors, and South African entities on a coordinated strategy to support the transition to a nonracial democracy in South Africa;
<br>
<br>"(4) in order to provide ownership and managerial opportunities, professional advancement, training, and employment for disadvantaged South Africans and to respond to the historical inequities created under apartheid, the United States should—
<br>
<br>"(A) promote the expansion of private enterprise and free markets in South Africa,
<br>
<br>"(B) encourage the South African private sector to take a special responsibility and interest in providing such opportunities, advancement, training, and employment for disadvantaged South Africans,
<br>
<br>"(C) encourage United States private sector investment in and trade with South Africa,
<br>
<br>"(D) urge United States investors to develop a working partnership with representative organs of South African civil society, particularly churches and trade unions, in promoting responsible codes of corporate conduct and other measures to address the historical inequities created under apartheid;
<br>
<br>"(5) the United States should urge the Government of South Africa to liberalize its trade and investment policies to facilitate the expansion of the economy, and to shift resources to meet the needs of disadvantaged South Africans;
<br>
<br>"(6) the United States should promote cooperation between South Africa and other countries in the region to foster regional stability and economic growth; and
<br>
<br>"(7) the United States should demonstrate its support for an expedited transition to, and should adopt a long term policy beneficial to the establishment and perpetuation of, a nonracial democracy in South Africa.
<br>"SEC. 4. REPEAL OF APARTHEID SANCTIONS LAWS AND OTHER MEASURES DIRECTED AT SOUTH AFRICA.
<br>
<br>"(a) Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act.—
<br>
<br>"(1) In general.—All provisions of the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986 (22 U.S.C. 5001 and following) are repealed as of the date of enactment of this Act [Nov. 23, 1993], except for the sections specified in paragraph (2).

<br>§5201. Findings; determinations
<br>(a) Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) Middle East terrorism accounted for 60 percent of total international terrorism in 1985;
<br>
<br>(2) the Palestine Liberation Organization (hereafter in this chapter referred to as the "PLO") was directly responsible for the murder of an American citizen on the Achille Lauro cruise liner in 1985, and a member of the PLO's Executive Committee is under indictment in the United States for the murder of that American citizen;
<br>
<br>(3) the head of the PLO has been implicated in the murder of a United States Ambassador overseas;
<br>
<br>(4) the PLO and its constituent groups have taken credit for, and been implicated in, the murders of dozens of American citizens abroad;
<br>
<br>(5) the PLO covenant specifically states that "armed struggle is the only way to liberate Palestine, thus it is an overall strategy, not merely a tactical phase";
<br>
<br>(6) the PLO rededicated itself to the "continuing struggle in all its armed forms" at the Palestine National Council meeting in April 1987; and
<br>
<br>(7) the Attorney General has stated that "various elements of the Palestine Liberation Organization and its allies and affiliates are in the thick of international terror".
<br>(b) Determinations
<br>
<br>Therefore, the Congress determines that the PLO and its affiliates are a terrorist organization and a threat to the interests of the United States, its allies, and to international law and should not benefit from operating in the United States.

<br>
<br>This subchapter, referred to in text, was in the original "this subtitle", meaning subtitle A (§§3001–3006) of title III of Pub. L. 100–418, Aug. 23, 1988, 102 Stat. 1372, which is classified principally to this subchapter. For complete classification of subtitle A to the Code, see Tables.
<br>§5302. Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) the macroeconomic policies, including the exchange rate policies, of the leading industrialized nations require improved coordination and are not consistent with long-term economic growth and financial stability;
<br>
<br>(2) currency values have a major role in determining the patterns of production and trade in the world economy;
<br>
<br>(3) the rise in the value of the dollar in the early 1980's contributed substantially to our current trade deficit;
<br>
<br>(4) exchange rates among major trading nations have become increasingly volatile and a pattern of exchange rates has at times developed which contribute to substantial and persistent imbalances in the flow of goods and services between nations, imposing serious strains on the world trading system and frustrating both business and government planning;
<br>
<br>(5) capital flows between nations have become very large compared to trade flows, respond at times quickly and dramatically to policy and economic changes, and, for these reasons, contribute significantly to uncertainty in financial markets, the volatility of exchange rates, and the development of exchange rates which produce imbalances in the flow of goods and services between nations;
<br>
<br>(6) policy initiatives by some major trading nations that manipulate the value of their currencies in relation to the United States dollar to gain competitive advantage continue to create serious competitive problems for United States industries;
<br>
<br>(7) a more stable exchange rate for the dollar at a level consistent with a more appropriate and sustainable balance in the United States current account should be a major focus of national economic policy;
<br>
<br>(8) procedures for improving the coordination of macroeconomic policy need to be strengthened considerably; and
<br>
<br>(9) under appropriate circumstances, intervention by the United States in foreign exchange markets as part of a coordinated international strategic intervention effort could produce more orderly adjustment of foreign exchange markets and, in combination with necessary macroeconomic policy changes, assist adjustment toward a more appropriate and sustainable balance in current accounts.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 100–418, title III, §3002, Aug. 23, 1988, 102 Stat. 1372.)
<br>§5303. Statement of policy
<br>
<br>It is the policy of the United States that—
<br>
<br>(1) the United States and the other major industrialized countries should take steps to continue the process of coordinating monetary, fiscal, and structural policies initiated in the Plaza Agreement of September 1985;
<br>
<br>(2) the goal of the United States in international economic negotiations should be to achieve macroeconomic policies and exchange rates consistent with more appropriate and sustainable balances in trade and capital flows and to foster price stability in conjunction with economic growth;
<br>
<br>(3) the United States, in close coordination with the other major industrialized countries should, where appropriate, participate in international currency markets with the objective of producing more orderly adjustment of foreign exchange markets and, in combination with necessary macroeconomic policy changes, assisting adjustment toward a more appropriate and sustainable balance in current accounts; and
<br>
<br>(4) the accountability of the President for the impact of economic policies and exchange rates on trade competitiveness should be increased.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 100–418, title III, §3003, Aug. 23, 1988, 102 Stat. 1373.)
<br>§5304. International negotiations on exchange rate and economic policies
<br>(a) Multilateral negotiations
<br>
<br>The President shall seek to confer and negotiate with other countries—
<br>
<br>(1) to achieve—
<br>
<br>(A) better coordination of macroeconomic policies of the major industrialized nations; and
<br>
<br>(B) more appropriate and sustainable levels of trade and current account balances, and exchange rates of the dollar and other currencies consistent with such balances; and
<br>
<br>(2) to develop a program for improving existing mechanisms for coordination and improving the functioning of the exchange rate system to provide for long-term exchange rate stability consistent with more appropriate and sustainable current account balances.
<br>(b) Bilateral negotiations
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Treasury shall analyze on an annual basis the exchange rate policies of foreign countries, in consultation with the International Monetary Fund, and consider whether countries manipulate the rate of exchange between their currency and the United States dollar for purposes of preventing effective balance of payments adjustments or gaining unfair competitive advantage in international trade. If the Secretary considers that such manipulation is occurring with respect to countries that (1) have material global current account surpluses; and (2) have significant bilateral trade surpluses with the United States, the Secretary of the Treasury shall take action to initiate negotiations with such foreign countries on an expedited basis, in the International Monetary Fund or bilaterally, for the purpose of ensuring that such countries regularly and promptly adjust the rate of exchange between their currencies and the United States dollar to permit effective balance of payments adjustments and to eliminate the unfair advantage. The Secretary shall not be required to initiate negotiations in cases where such negotiations would have a serious detrimental impact on vital national economic and security interests; in such cases, the Secretary shall inform the chairman and the ranking minority member of the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and of the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives of his determination.

<br>
<br>"(1) the benefit of trade concessions can be adversely affected by misalignments in currency, and

<br>§5322. Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) the international debt problem threatens the safety and soundness of the international financial system, the stability of the international trading system, and the economic development of the debtor countries;
<br>
<br>(2) orderly reduction of international trade imbalances requires very substantial growth in all parts of the world economy, particularly in the developing countries;
<br>
<br>(3) growth in developing countries with substantial external debts has been significantly constrained over the last several years by a combination of high debt service obligations and insufficient new flows of financial resources to these countries;
<br>
<br>(4) substantial interest payment outflows from debtor countries, combined with inadequate net new capital inflows, have produced a significant net transfer of financial resources from debtor to creditor countries;
<br>
<br>(5) negative resource transfers at present levels severely depress both investment and growth in the debtor countries, and force debtor countries to reduce imports and expand exports in order to meet their debt service obligations;
<br>
<br>(6) current adjustment policies in debtor countries, which depress domestic demand and increase production for export, help to depress world commodity prices and limit the growth of export markets for United States industries;
<br>
<br>(7) the United States has borne a disproportionate share of the burden of absorbing increased exports from debtor countries, while other industrialized countries have increased their imports from developing countries only slightly;
<br>
<br>(8) current approaches to the debt problem should not rely solely on new lending as a solution to the debt problem, and should focus on other financing alternatives including a reduction in current debt service obligations;
<br>
<br>(9) new international mechanisms to improve the management of the debt problem and to expand the range of financing options available to developing countries should be explored; and
<br>
<br>(10) industrial countries with strong current account surpluses have a disproportionate share of the world's capital resources, and bear an additional responsibility for contributing to a viable long-term solution to the debt problem.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 100–418, title III, §3102, Aug. 23, 1988, 102 Stat. 1375.)
<br>§5323. Purposes
<br>
<br>The purposes of this subchapter are—
<br>
<br>(1) to expand the world trading system and raise the level of exports from the United States to the developing countries in order to reduce the United States trade deficit and foster economic expansion and an increase in the standard of living throughout the world;
<br>
<br>(2) to alleviate the current international debt problem in order to make the debt situation of developing countries more manageable and permit the resumption of sustained growth in those countries; and
<br>
<br>(3) to increase the stability of the world financial system and ensure the safety and soundness of United States depository institutions.

<br>§5324. Statement of policy
<br>
<br>It is the policy of the United States that—
<br>
<br>(1) increasing growth in the developing world is a major goal of international economic policy;
<br>
<br>(2) it is necessary to broaden the range of options in dealing with the debt problem to include improved mechanisms to restructure existing debt;
<br>
<br>(3) active consideration of a new multilateral authority to improve the management of the debt problem and to share the burdens of adjustment more equitably must be undertaken; and
<br>
<br>(4) countries with strong current account surpluses bear a major responsibility for providing the financial resources needed for growth in the developing world.
