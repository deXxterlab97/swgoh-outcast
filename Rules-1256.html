<br>(a) Findings
<br>
<br>Congress finds the following:
<br>
<br>(1) The Government of North Korea—
<br>
<br>(A) has repeatedly violated its commitments to the complete, verifiable, and irreversible dismantlement of its nuclear weapons programs; and
<br>
<br>(B) has willfully violated multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions calling for North Korea to cease development, testing, and production of weapons of mass destruction.
<br>
<br>(2) Based on its past actions, including the transfer of sensitive nuclear and missile technology to state sponsors of terrorism, North Korea poses a grave risk for the proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.
<br>
<br>(3) The Government of North Korea has been implicated repeatedly in money laundering and other illicit activities, including—
<br>
<br>(A) prohibited arms sales;
<br>
<br>(B) narcotics trafficking;
<br>
<br>(C) the counterfeiting of United States currency;
<br>
<br>(D) significant activities undermining cybersecurity; and
<br>
<br>(E) the counterfeiting of intellectual property of United States persons.
<br>
<br>(4) North Korea has—
<br>
<br>(A) unilaterally withdrawn from the Agreement Concerning a Military Armistice in Korea, signed at Panmunjom July 27, 1953 (commonly referred to as the "Korean War Armistice Agreement"); and
<br>
<br>(B) committed provocations against South Korea—
<br>
<br>(i) by sinking the warship Cheonan and killing 46 of her crew on March 26, 2010;
<br>
<br>(ii) by shelling Yeonpyeong Island and killing 4 South Korean civilians on November 23, 2010;
<br>
<br>(iii) by its involvement in the "DarkSeoul" cyberattacks against the financial and communications interests of South Korea on March 20, 2013; and
<br>
<br>(iv) by planting land mines near a guard post in the South Korean portion of the demilitarized zone that maimed 2 South Korean soldiers on August 4, 2015.
<br>
<br>(5) North Korea maintains a system of brutal political prison camps that contain as many as 200,000 men, women, and children, who are—
<br>
<br>(A) kept in atrocious living conditions with insufficient food, clothing, and medical care; and
<br>
<br>(B) under constant fear of torture or arbitrary execution.
<br>
<br>(6) North Korea has prioritized weapons programs and the procurement of luxury goods—
<br>
<br>(A) in defiance of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1695 (2006), 1718 (2006), 1874 (2009), 2087 (2013), and 2094 (2013); and
<br>
<br>(B) in gross disregard of the needs of the people of North Korea.
<br>
<br>(7) Persons, including financial institutions, who engage in transactions with, or provide financial services to, the Government of North Korea and its financial institutions without establishing sufficient financial safeguards against North Korea's use of such transactions to promote proliferation, weapons trafficking, human rights violations, illicit activity, and the purchase of luxury goods—
<br>
<br>(A) aid and abet North Korea's misuse of the international financial system; and
<br>
<br>(B) violate the intent of the United Nations Security Council resolutions referred to in paragraph (6)(A).
<br>
<br>(8) The Government of North Korea has provided technical support and conducted destructive and coercive cyberattacks, including against Sony Pictures Entertainment and other United States persons.
<br>
<br>(9) The conduct of the Government of North Korea poses an imminent threat to—
<br>
<br>(A) the security of the United States and its allies;
<br>
<br>(B) the global economy;
<br>
<br>(C) the safety of members of the United States Armed Forces;
<br>
<br>(D) the integrity of the global financial system;
<br>
<br>(E) the integrity of global nonproliferation programs; and
<br>
<br>(F) the people of North Korea.
<br>
<br>(10) The Government of North Korea has sponsored acts of international terrorism, including—
<br>
<br>(A) attempts to assassinate defectors and human rights activists; and
<br>
<br>(B) the shipment of weapons to terrorists and state sponsors of terrorism.
<br>(b) Purposes
<br>
<br>The purposes of this chapter are—
<br>
<br>(1) to use nonmilitary means to address the crisis described in subsection (a);

<br>(3) to ease the suffering of the people of North Korea; and

<br>

<br>
<br>(1) to encourage all member states of the United Nations to fully and promptly implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 2094 (2013);
<br>
<br>(2) to sanction the persons, including financial institutions, that facilitate proliferation, illicit activities, arms trafficking, cyberterrorism, imports of luxury goods, serious human rights abuses, cash smuggling, and censorship by the Government of North Korea;
<br>
<br>(3) to authorize the President to sanction persons who fail to exercise due diligence to ensure that such financial institutions and member states do not facilitate proliferation, arms trafficking, kleptocracy, or imports of luxury goods by the Government of North Korea;
<br>
<br>(4) to deny the Government of North Korea access to the funds it uses to develop or obtain nuclear weapons, ballistic missiles, cyberwarfare capabilities, and luxury goods instead of providing for the needs of the people of North Korea; and
<br>
<br>(5) to enforce sanctions in a manner that does not significantly hinder or delay the efforts of legitimate United States or foreign humanitarian organizations from providing assistance to meet the needs of civilians facing humanitarian crisis, including access to food, health care, shelter, and clean drinking water, to prevent or alleviate human suffering.

<br>SUBCHAPTER II—SANCTIONS AGAINST NORTH KOREAN PROLIFERATION, HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES, AND ILLICIT ACTIVITIES
<br>§9221. Determinations with respect to North Korea as a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern
<br>(a) Findings
<br>
<br>Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>(1) The Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, who is responsible for safeguarding the financial system against illicit use, money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and has repeatedly expressed concern about North Korea's misuse of the international financial system—
<br>
<br>(A) in 2006—
<br>
<br>(i) stated, "Given [North Korea's] counterfeiting of U.S. currency, narcotics trafficking and use of accounts world-wide to conduct proliferation-related transactions, the line between illicit and licit North Korean money is nearly invisible."; and
<br>
<br>(ii) urged financial institutions worldwide to "think carefully about the risks of doing any North Korea-related business";
<br>
<br>(B) in 2011, stated that North Korea—
<br>
<br>(i) "remains intent on engaging in proliferation, selling arms as well as bringing in material"; and
<br>
<br>(ii) was "aggressively pursuing the effort to establish front companies."; and
<br>
<br>(C) in 2013, stated—
<br>
<br>(i) in reference to North Korea's distribution of high-quality counterfeit United States currency, that "North Korea is continuing to try to pass a supernote into the international financial system"; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the Department of the Treasury would soon introduce new currency with improved security features to protect against counterfeiting by the Government of North Korea.
<br>
<br>(2) The Financial Action Task Force, an intergovernmental body whose purpose is to develop and promote national and international policies to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, has repeatedly—
<br>
<br>(A) expressed concern at deficiencies in North Korea's regimes to combat money laundering and terrorist financing;
<br>
<br>(B) urged North Korea to adopt a plan of action to address significant deficiencies in those regimes and the serious threat those deficiencies pose to the integrity of the international financial system;
<br>
<br>(C) urged all jurisdictions to apply countermeasures to protect the international financial system from ongoing and substantial money laundering and terrorist financing risks emanating from North Korea;
<br>
<br>(D) urged all jurisdictions to advise their financial institutions to give special attention to business relationships and transactions with North Korea, including North Korean companies and financial institutions; and
<br>
<br>(E) called on all jurisdictions—
<br>
<br>(i) to protect against correspondent relationships being used to bypass or evade countermeasures and risk mitigation practices; and
<br>
<br>(ii) to take into account money laundering and terrorist financing risks when considering requests by North Korean financial institutions to open branches and subsidiaries in their respective jurisdictions.
<br>
<br>(3) On March 7, 2013, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2094, which—
<br>
<br>(A) welcomed the Financial Action Task Force's—
<br>
<br>(i) recommendation on financial sanctions related to proliferation; and
<br>
<br>(ii) guidance on the implementation of such sanctions;
<br>
<br>(B) decided that United Nations member states should apply enhanced monitoring and other legal measures to prevent the provision of financial services or the transfer of property that could contribute to activities prohibited by applicable United Nations Security Council resolutions; and
<br>
<br>(C) called upon United Nations member states to prohibit North Korean financial institutions from establishing or maintaining correspondent relationships with financial institutions in their respective jurisdictions to prevent the provision of financial services if such member states have information that provides reasonable grounds to believe that such activities could contribute to—
<br>
<br>(i) activities prohibited by an applicable United Nations Security Council resolution; or
<br>
<br>(ii) the evasion of such prohibitions.
<br>(b) Sense of Congress regarding the designation of North Korea as a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern
<br>
<br>Congress—
<br>
<br>(1) acknowledges the efforts of the United Nations Security Council to impose limitations on, and to require the enhanced monitoring of, transactions involving North Korean financial institutions that could contribute to sanctioned activities;
<br>
<br>(2) urges the President, in the strongest terms—
<br>
<br>(A) to immediately designate North Korea as a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern; and
<br>
<br>(B) to adopt stringent special measures to safeguard the financial system against the risks posed by North Korea's willful evasion of sanctions and its illicit activities; and
<br>
<br>(3) urges the President to seek the prompt implementation by other countries of enhanced monitoring and due diligence to prevent North Korea's misuse of the international financial system, including by sharing information about activities, transactions, and property that could contribute to—
<br>
<br>(A) activities sanctioned by applicable United Nations Security Council resolutions; or
<br>
<br>(B) the evasion of such sanctions.
<br>(c) Determinations regarding North Korea
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Not later than 180 days after February 18, 2016, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, and in accordance with section 5318A of title 31, shall determine whether reasonable grounds exist for concluding that North Korea is a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern.
<br>(2) Enhanced due diligence and reporting requirements
<br>
<br>If the Secretary of the Treasury determines under paragraph (1) that reasonable grounds exist for concluding that North Korea is a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern, the Secretary, in consultation with the Federal functional regulators (as defined in section 6809 of title 15), shall impose 1 or more of the special measures described in section 5318A(b) of title 31 with respect to the jurisdiction of North Korea.

<br>
<br>(1) arises from, and is ordinarily incident and necessary to give effect to, an underlying transaction that has been authorized by a specific or general license issued by the Secretary of the Treasury; and
<br>
<br>(2) does not involve debiting or crediting a North Korean account.
