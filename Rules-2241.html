<br>§50913. Acquiring United States Government property and services
<br>
<br>(a) General Requirements and Considerations.—(1) The Secretary of Transportation shall facilitate and encourage the acquisition by the private sector and State governments of—
<br>
<br>(A) launch or reentry property of the United States Government that is excess or otherwise is not needed for public use; and
<br>
<br>(B) launch services and reentry services, including utilities, of the Government otherwise not needed for public use.
<br>
<br>(2) In acting under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Secretary shall consider the commercial availability on reasonable terms of substantially equivalent launch property or launch services or reentry services from a domestic source, whether such source is located on or off a Federal range.
<br>
<br>(b) Price.—(1) In this subsection, "direct costs" means the actual costs that—
<br>
<br>(A) can be associated unambiguously with a commercial launch or reentry effort; and
<br>
<br>(B) the Government would not incur if there were no commercial launch or reentry effort.
<br>
<br>(2) In consultation with the Secretary, the head of the executive agency providing the property or service under subsection (a) of this section shall establish the price for the property or service. The price for—
<br>
<br>(A) acquiring launch property by sale or transaction instead of sale is the fair market value;
<br>
<br>(B) acquiring launch property (except by sale or transaction instead of sale) is an amount equal to the direct costs, including specific wear and tear and property damage, the Government incurred because of acquisition of the property; and
<br>
<br>(C) launch services or reentry services is an amount equal to the direct costs, including the basic pay of Government civilian and contractor personnel, the Government incurred because of acquisition of the services.
<br>
<br>(3) The Secretary shall ensure the establishment of uniform guidelines for, and consistent implementation of, this section by all Federal agencies.
<br>
<br>(c) Collection by Secretary.—The Secretary may collect a payment under this section with the consent of the head of the executive agency establishing the price. Amounts collected under this subsection shall be deposited in the Treasury. Amounts (except for excess launch property) shall be credited to the appropriation from which the cost of providing the property or services was paid.
<br>
<br>(d) Collection by Other Governmental Heads.—The head of a department, agency, or instrumentality of the Government may collect a payment for an activity involved in producing a launch vehicle or reentry vehicle, or the payload of either, for launch or reentry if the activity was agreed to by the owner or manufacturer of the launch vehicle, reentry vehicle, or payload.

<br>
<br>(a) General Requirements.—(1) When a launch or reentry license is issued or transferred under this chapter, the licensee or transferee shall obtain liability insurance or demonstrate financial responsibility in amounts to compensate for the maximum probable loss from claims by—
<br>
<br>(A) a third party for death, bodily injury, or property damage or loss resulting from an activity carried out under the license; and
<br>
<br>(B) the United States Government against a person for damage or loss to Government property resulting from an activity carried out under the license.
<br>
<br>(2) The Secretary of Transportation shall determine the amounts required under paragraph (1)(A) and (B) of this subsection, after consulting with the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Secretary of the Air Force, and the heads of other appropriate executive agencies.
<br>
<br>(3) For the total claims related to one launch or reentry, a licensee or transferee is not required to obtain insurance or demonstrate financial responsibility of more than—
<br>
<br>(A)(i) $500,000,000 under paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection; or
<br>
<br>(ii) $100,000,000 under paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection; or
<br>

<br>
<br>(4) An insurance policy or demonstration of financial responsibility under this subsection shall protect the following, to the extent of their potential liability for involvement in launch services or reentry services, at no cost to the Government:
<br>
<br>(A) the Government.
<br>
<br>(B) executive agencies and personnel, contractors, and subcontractors of the Government.
<br>
<br>(C) contractors, subcontractors, and customers of the licensee or transferee.
<br>
<br>(D) contractors and subcontractors of the customer.
<br>
<br>(E) space flight participants.
<br>
<br>(5) Subparagraph (E) of paragraph (4) ceases to be effective September 30, 2025.
<br>
<br>(b) Reciprocal Waiver of Claims.—(1)(A) A launch or reentry license issued or transferred under this chapter shall contain a provision requiring the licensee or transferee to make a reciprocal waiver of claims with applicable parties involved in launch services or reentry services under which each party to the waiver agrees to be responsible for personal injury to, death of, or property damage or loss sustained by it or its own employees resulting from an activity carried out under the applicable license.
<br>
<br>(B) In this paragraph, the term "applicable parties" means—

<br>
<br>(ii) contractors and subcontractors of the customers; and

<br>(iii) space flight participants.
<br>
<br>(C) Clause (iii) of subparagraph (B) ceases to be effective September 30, 2025.

The waiver applies only to the extent that claims are more than the amount of insurance or demonstration of financial responsibility required under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section. After consulting with the Administrator and the Secretary of the Air Force, the Secretary of Transportation may waive, for the Government and a department, agency, and instrumentality of the Government, the right to recover damages for damage or loss to Government property to the extent insurance is not available because of a policy exclusion the Secretary of Transportation decides is usual for the type of insurance involved.
<br>
<br>(c) Determination of Maximum Probable Losses.—The Secretary of Transportation shall determine the maximum probable losses under subsection (a)(1)(A) and (B) of this section associated with an activity under a license not later than 90 days after a licensee or transferee requires a determination and submits all information the Secretary requires.

<br>
<br>(e) Launches or Reentries Involving Government Facilities and Personnel.—The Secretary of Transportation shall establish requirements consistent with this chapter for proof of financial responsibility and other assurances necessary to protect the Government and its executive agencies and personnel from liability, death, bodily injury, or property damage or loss as a result of a launch or operation of a launch site or reentry site or a reentry involving a facility or personnel of the Government. The Secretary may not relieve the Government of liability under this subsection for death, bodily injury, or property damage or loss resulting from the willful misconduct of the Government or its agents.
<br>
<br>(f) Collection and Crediting Payments.—The head of a department, agency, or instrumentality of the Government shall collect a payment owed for damage or loss to Government property under its jurisdiction or control resulting from an activity carried out under a launch or reentry license issued or transferred under this chapter. The payment shall be credited to the current applicable appropriation, fund, or account of the department, agency, or instrumentality.
<br>
<br>(g) Federal Jurisdiction.—Any claim by a third party or space flight participant for death, bodily injury, or property damage or loss resulting from an activity carried out under the license shall be the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal courts.

<br>§50915. Paying claims exceeding liability insurance and financial responsibility requirements
<br>
<br>(a) General Requirements.—(1) To the extent provided in advance in an appropriation law or to the extent additional legislative authority is enacted providing for paying claims in a compensation plan submitted under subsection (d) of this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall provide for the payment by the United States Government of a successful claim (including reasonable litigation or settlement expenses) of a third party against a person described in paragraph (3)(A) resulting from an activity carried out under the license issued or transferred under this chapter for death, bodily injury, or property damage or loss resulting from an activity carried out under the license. However, claims may be paid under this section only to the extent the total amount of successful claims related to one launch or reentry—
<br>
<br>(A) is more than the amount of insurance or demonstration of financial responsibility required under section 50914(a)(1)(A) of this title; and
<br>
<br>(B) is not more than $1,500,000,000 (plus additional amounts necessary to reflect inflation occurring after January 1, 1989) above that insurance or financial responsibility amount.
<br>
<br>(2) The Secretary may not provide for paying a part of a claim for which death, bodily injury, or property damage or loss results from willful misconduct by the licensee or transferee. To the extent insurance required under section 50914(a)(1)(A) of this title is not available to cover a successful third party liability claim because of an insurance policy exclusion the Secretary decides is usual for the type of insurance involved, the Secretary may provide for paying the excluded claims without regard to the limitation contained in section 50914(a)(1).
<br>
<br>(3)(A) A person described in this subparagraph is—
<br>
<br>(i) a licensee or transferee under this chapter;
<br>
<br>(ii) a contractor, subcontractor, or customer of the licensee or transferee;
<br>
<br>(iii) a contractor or subcontractor of a customer; or
<br>
<br>(iv) a space flight participant.
<br>
<br>(B) Clause (iv) of subparagraph (A) ceases to be effective September 30, 2025.
<br>
<br>(b) Notice, Participation, and Approval.—Before a payment under subsection (a) of this section is made—
<br>
<br>(1) notice must be given to the Government of a claim, or a civil action related to the claim, against a party described in subsection (a)(1) of this section for death, bodily injury, or property damage or loss;
<br>
<br>(2) the Government must be given an opportunity to participate or assist in the defense of the claim or action; and
<br>
<br>(3) the Secretary must approve any part of a settlement to be paid out of appropriations of the Government.
<br>
<br>(c) Withholding Payments.—The Secretary may withhold a payment under subsection (a) of this section if the Secretary certifies that the amount is not reasonable. However, the Secretary shall deem to be reasonable the amount of a claim finally decided by a court of competent jurisdiction.
<br>
<br>(d) Surveys, Reports, and Compensation Plans.—(1) If as a result of an activity carried out under a license issued or transferred under this chapter the total of claims related to one launch or reentry is likely to be more than the amount of required insurance or demonstration of financial responsibility, the Secretary shall—
<br>
<br>(A) survey the causes and extent of damage; and
<br>
<br>(B) submit expeditiously to Congress a report on the results of the survey.
<br>
<br>(2) Not later than 90 days after a court determination indicates that the liability for the total of claims related to one launch or reentry may be more than the required amount of insurance or demonstration of financial responsibility, the President, on the recommendation of the Secretary, shall submit to Congress a compensation plan that—
<br>
<br>(A) outlines the total dollar value of the claims;
<br>
<br>(B) recommends sources of amounts to pay for the claims;
<br>
<br>(C) includes legislative language required to carry out the plan if additional legislative authority is required; and
<br>
<br>(D) for a single event or incident, may not be for more than $1,500,000,000.
<br>
<br>(3) A compensation plan submitted to Congress under paragraph (2) of this subsection shall—
<br>
<br>(A) have an identification number; and
<br>
<br>(B) be submitted to the Senate and the House of Representatives on the same day and when the Senate and House are in session.
<br>
<br>(e) Congressional Resolutions.—(1) In this subsection, "resolution"—
<br>
<br>(A) means a joint resolution of Congress the matter after the resolving clause of which is as follows: "That the Congress approves the compensation plan numbered __________ submitted to the Congress on __________ XX, 20____.", with the blank spaces being filled appropriately; but
<br>
