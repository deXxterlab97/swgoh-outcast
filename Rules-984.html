<br>
<br>A consolidation loan made pursuant to this section shall be insurable by the Secretary or a guaranty agency pursuant to paragraph (2) only if the loan is made to an eligible borrower who has agreed to notify the holder of the loan promptly concerning any change of address and the loan is evidenced by a note or other written agreement which—

<br>
<br>(II) by the Secretary, in the case of a consolidation loan for which the application is received by an eligible lender on or after November 13, 1997, except that the Secretary shall pay such interest only on that portion of the loan that repays Federal Stafford Loans for which the student borrower received an interest subsidy under section 1078 of this title or Federal Direct Stafford Loans for which the borrower received an interest subsidy under section 1087e of this title; or

<br>(III) by the borrower, or capitalized, in the case of a consolidation loan other than a loan described in subclause (I) or (II);
<br>

A direct consolidation loan offered under this paragraph shall, as requested by the borrower, be repaid either pursuant to income contingent repayment under part D of this subchapter, pursuant to income-based repayment under section 1098e of this title, or pursuant to any other repayment provision under this section, except that if a borrower intends to be eligible to use the public service loan forgiveness program under section 1087e(m) of this title, such loan shall be repaid using one of the repayment options described in section 1087e(m)(1)(A) of this title. The Secretary shall not offer such loans if, in the Secretary's judgment, the Department of Education does not have the necessary origination and servicing arrangements in place for such loans.

<br>
<br>(ii) 9 percent.
<br>
<br>(C) A consolidation loan made on or after July 1, 1994, and disbursed before July 1, 2010, shall bear interest at an annual rate on the unpaid principal balance of the loan that is equal to the weighted average of the interest rates on the loans consolidated, rounded upward to the nearest whole percent.

<br>(2) Repayment schedules

<br>
<br>With respect to a loan sold under subparagraph (A)(i)—
<br>
<br>(i) the guaranty agency—
<br>
<br>(I) shall, in the case of a sale made on or after July 1, 2014, repay the Secretary 100 percent of the amount of the principal balance outstanding at the time of such sale, multiplied by the reinsurance percentage in effect when payment under the guaranty agreement was made with respect to the loan; and

<br>
<br>A loan that does not meet the requirements of subparagraph (A) may also be eligible for sale or assignment under this paragraph upon a determination that the loan was in default due to clerical or data processing error and would not, in the absence of such error, be in a delinquent status.

<br>
<br>Any borrower whose loan is sold or assigned under paragraph (1)(A) shall not be precluded by section 1091 of this title from receiving additional loans or grants under this subchapter (for which he or she is otherwise eligible) on the basis of defaulting on the loan prior to such loan sale or assignment.

<br>(b) Satisfactory repayment arrangements to renew eligibility
<br>
<br>Each guaranty agency shall establish a program which allows a borrower with a defaulted loan or loans to renew eligibility for all subchapter IV student financial assistance (regardless of whether the defaulted loan has been sold to an eligible lender or assigned to the Secretary) upon the borrower's payment of 6 consecutive monthly payments. The guaranty agency shall not demand from a borrower as a monthly payment amount under this subsection more than is reasonable and affordable based upon the borrower's total financial circumstances. A borrower may only obtain the benefit of this subsection with respect to renewed eligibility once.
<br>(c) Financial and economic literacy
<br>
<br>Each program described in subsection (b) shall include making available financial and economic education materials for a borrower who has rehabilitated a loan.

<br>§1078–8. Unsubsidized Stafford loans for middle-income borrowers
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>It is the purpose of this section to authorize insured loans under this part that are first disbursed before July 1, 2010, for borrowers who do not qualify for Federal interest subsidy payments under section 1078 of this title. Except as provided in this section, all terms and conditions for Federal Stafford loans established under section 1078 of this title shall apply to loans made pursuant to this section.
<br>(b) Eligible borrowers
<br>
<br>Prior to July 1, 2010, any student meeting the requirements for student eligibility under section 1091 of this title (including graduate and professional students as defined in regulations promulgated by the Secretary) shall be entitled to borrow an unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan for which the first disbursement is made before such date if the eligible institution at which the student has been accepted for enrollment, or at which the student is in attendance, has—
<br>
<br>(1) determined and documented the student's need for the loan based on the student's estimated cost of attendance (as determined under section 1087ll of this title) and the student's estimated financial assistance, including a loan which qualifies for interest subsidy payments under section 1078 of this title; and
<br>
<br>(2) provided the lender a statement—
<br>
<br>(A) certifying the eligibility of the student to receive a loan under this section and the amount of the loan for which such student is eligible, in accordance with subsection (c); and
<br>
<br>(B) setting forth a schedule for disbursement of the proceeds of the loan in installments, consistent with the requirements of section 1078–7 of this title.
<br>(c) Determination of amount of loan
<br>
<br>The determination of the amount of a loan by an eligible institution under subsection (b) shall be calculated by subtracting from the estimated cost of attendance at the eligible institution any estimated financial assistance reasonably available to such student. An eligible institution may not, in carrying out the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, provide a statement which certifies the eligibility of any student to receive any loan under this section in excess of the amount calculated under the preceding sentence.
<br>(d) Loan limits
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in paragraphs (2), (3), and (4), the annual and aggregate limits for loans under this section shall be the same as those established under section 1078(b)(1) of this title, less any amount received by such student pursuant to the subsidized loan program established under section 1078 of this title.
<br>(2) Limits for graduate, professional, and independent postbaccalaureate students

<br>
<br>except in cases where the Secretary determines that a higher amount is warranted in order to carry out the purpose of this part with respect to students engaged in specialized training requiring exceptionally high costs of education, but the annual insurable limit per student shall not be deemed to be exceeded by a line of credit under which actual payments by the lender to the borrower will not be made in any years in excess of the annual limit.
<br>(B) Aggregate limit

<br>
<br>(I) section 1091(b)(3)(B) of this title, $6,000; or

<br>(2) Capitalization of interest
<br>
<br>(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (C), interest on loans made under this section for which payments of principal are not required during the in-school and grace periods or for which payments are deferred under sections 1077(a)(2)(C) and 1078(b)(1)(M) of this title shall, if agreed upon by the borrower and the lender—
<br>

<br>
<br>The amount of the periodic payment and the repayment schedule for any loan made pursuant to this section shall be established by assuming an interest rate equal to the applicable rate of interest at the time the repayment of the principal amount of the loan commences. At the option of the lender, the note or other written evidence of the loan may require that—
<br>
<br>(A) the amount of the periodic payment will be adjusted annually; or
<br>
<br>(B) the period of repayment of principal will be lengthened or shortened,
<br>
<br>in order to reflect adjustments in interest rates occurring as a consequence of section 1077a(c)(4) of this title.
