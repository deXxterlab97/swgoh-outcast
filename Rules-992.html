<br>§1087ff. Distribution of assets from student loan funds
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>Beginning October 1, 2017, there shall be a capital distribution of the balance of the student loan fund established under this part by each institution of higher education as follows:
<br>
<br>(1) The Secretary shall first be paid an amount which bears the same ratio to the balance in such fund at the close of September 30, 2017, as the total amount of the Federal capital contributions to such fund by the Secretary under this part bears to the sum of such Federal contributions and the institution's capital contributions to such fund.
<br>
<br>(2) The remainder of such balance shall be paid to the institution.
<br>(b) Distribution of late collections
<br>
<br>Beginning October 1, 2017, each institution with which the Secretary has made an agreement under this part, shall pay to the Secretary the same proportionate share of amounts received by this institution after September 30, 2017, in payment of principal and interest on student loans made from the student loan fund established pursuant to such agreement (which amount shall be determined after deduction of any costs of litigation incurred in collection of the principal or interest on loans from the fund and not already reimbursed from the fund or from such payments of principal or interest), as was determined for the Secretary under subsection (a).
<br>(c) Distribution of excess capital
<br>
<br>(1) Upon a finding by the institution or the Secretary prior to October 1, 2017, that the liquid assets of a student loan fund established pursuant to an agreement under this part exceed the amount required for loans or otherwise in the foreseeable future, and upon notice to such institution or to the Secretary, as the case may be, there shall be, subject to such limitations as may be included in regulations of the Secretary or in such agreement, a capital distribution from such fund. Such capital distribution shall be made as follows:
<br>
<br>(A) The Secretary shall first be paid an amount which bears the same ratio to the total to be distributed as the Federal capital contributions by the Secretary to the student loan fund prior to such distribution bear to the sum of such Federal capital contributions and the capital contributions to the fund made by the institution.
<br>
<br>(B) The remainder of the capital distribution shall be paid to the institution.
<br>
<br>(2) No finding that the liquid assets of a student loan fund established under this part exceed the amount required under paragraph (1) may be made prior to a date which is 2 years after the date on which the institution of higher education received the funds from such institution's allocation under section 1087bb of this title.

<br>
<br>Pub. L. 108–199, div. E, title III, §305, Jan. 23, 2004, 118 Stat. 263, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(a) Study Required.—The Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance established by section 491 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1098), hereafter in this section referred to as 'the Advisory Committee', shall conduct a thorough study of the feasibility of simplifying the need analysis methodology for all Federal student financial assistance programs and the process of applying for such assistance.
<br>
<br>"(b) Required Subjects of Study.—In performing the study, the Advisory Committee shall, at a minimum, examine the following:
<br>
<br>"(1) whether the methodology used to calculate the expected family contribution can be simplified without significant adverse effects on program intent, costs, integrity, delivery, and distribution of awards;
<br>
<br>"(2) whether the number of data elements, and, accordingly, the number and complexity of questions asked of students and families, used to calculate the expected family contribution can be reduced without such adverse effects;
<br>
<br>"(3) whether the procedures for determining such data elements, including determining and updating offsets and allowances, is the most efficient, effective, and fair means to determine a family's available income and assets;
<br>
<br>"(4) whether the methodology used to calculate the expected family contribution, specifically the consideration of income earned by a dependent student and its effect on Pell grant eligibility, is an effective and fair means to determine a family's available income and a student's need;
<br>
<br>"(5) whether the nature and timing of the application required in section 483 (a)(1) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1090(a)(1)), eligibility and award determination, financial aid processing, and funds delivery can be streamlined further for students and families, institutions, and States;
<br>
<br>"(6) whether it is feasible to allow students to complete only those limited sections of the financial aid application that apply to their specific circumstances and the State in which they reside;
<br>
<br>"(7) whether a widely disseminated printed form, or the use of an Internet or other electronic means, can be developed to notify individuals of an estimation of their approximate eligibility for grant, work-study, and loan assistance upon completion and verification of the simplified application form;
<br>
<br>"(8) whether information provided on other Federal forms (such as the form applying for supplemental security income under title XVI of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1381 et seq.], the form for applying for food stamps under the Food Stamp Act of 1977 [now the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, 7 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.], and the schedule for applying for the earned income tax credit under section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [26 U.S.C. 32]) that are designed to determine eligibility for various Federal need-based assistance programs could be used to qualify potential students for the simplified needs test; and
<br>
<br>"(9) whether any proposed changes to data elements collected, in addition to those used to calculate expected family contribution, or any proposed changes to the form's design or the process of applying for aid, may have adverse effects on program costs, integrity, delivery, or distribution of awards, as well as, application development or application processing.
<br>
<br>"(c) Additional Considerations.—In conducting the feasibility study, the Advisory Committee's primary objective under this subsection shall be simplifying the financial aid application forms and process and obtaining a substantial reduction in the number of required data items. In carrying out that objective, the Advisory Committee shall pay special attention to the needs of low-income and moderate-income students and families.
<br>
<br>"(d) Consultation.—
<br>
<br>"(1) In general.—The Advisory Committee shall consult with a broad range of interested parties in higher education, including parents and students, high school guidance counselors, financial aid and other campus administrators, appropriate State administrators, administrators of intervention and outreach programs, and appropriate officials from the Department of Education.
<br>
<br>"(2) Forms design expert.—With the goal of making significant changes to the form to make the questions more easily understandable, the Advisory Committee shall consult a forms design expert to ensure that its recommendations for revision of the application form would assist in making the form easily readable and understood by parents, students, and other members of the public.
<br>
<br>"(3) Congressional consultation.—The Advisory Committee shall consult on a regular basis with the Committee on Education and the Workforce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate in carrying out the feasibility study required by this subsection.
<br>
<br>"(4) Departmental consultation.—The Secretary of Education shall provide such assistance to the Advisory Committee as is requested and practicable in conducting the study required by this subsection.
<br>
<br>"(e) Reports.—
<br>
<br>"(1) Interim report.—The Advisory Committee shall, not later than 6 months after the date of enactment of this Act [Jan. 23, 2004], prepare and submit an interim report containing any such legislative changes as the Advisory Committee recommends to reform and simplify the needs analysis under part F of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1087kk et seq.) and forms and other requirements under such title to the Committee on Education and the Workforce of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate, and the Secretary of Education.
