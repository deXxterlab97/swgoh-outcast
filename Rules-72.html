<br>10	And their prince shall triumph over kings, and princes shall be his laughingstock: and he shall laugh at every strong hold, and shall cast up a mount, and shall take it.
<br>11	Then shall his spirit be changed, and he shall pass, and fall: this is his strength of his god.
<br>12	Wast thou not from the beginning, O Lord my God, my holy one, and we shall not die? Lord, thou hast appointed him for judgment: and made him strong for correction.
<br>13	Thy eyes are too pure to behold evil, and thou canst not look on iniquity. Why lookest thou upon them that do unjust things, and hold- est thy peace when the wicked devoureth the man that is more just than himself?
<br>14	And thou wilt make men as the fishes of the sea, and as the creeping things that have no ruler.
<br>15	He lifted up all them with his hook, he drew them in his drag, and gathered them into his net: for this he will be glad and rejoice.
<br>16	Therefore will he offer victims to his drag, and he will sacrifice to his net: because through them his portion is made fat, and his meat dainty.
<br>17	For this cause therefore he spreadeth his net, and will not spare continually to slay the nations.

<br>I will stand upon my watch, and fix my foot upon the tower: and I will watch, to see what will be said to me, and what I may answer to him that reproveth me.
<br>2	And the Lord answered me, and said: Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables: that he that readeth it may run over it.
<br>3	For as yet the vision is far off, and it shall appear at the end, and shall notlie: if it make any delay, wait for it: for it shall surely come, and it shall not be slack.
<br>4	Behold, he that is unbelieving, his soul shall not be right in himself: but the just shall live in his faith.
<br>5	And as wine deceiveth him that drinketh it: so shall the proud man be, and he shall not be honoured: who hath enlarged his desire like hell: and is himself like death, and he is never satisfied: but will gather together unto him all nations, and heap together unto him all people. 6 Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a dark speech concerning him: and it shall be said: Woe to him that heapeth together that which is not his own? how long also doth
<br>he load himself with thick clay?
<br>7	Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee: and they be stirred up that shall tear thee, and thou shalt be a spoil to them?
<br>8	Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all that shall be left of the people shall spoil thee: because of men’s blood, and for the iniquity of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein. 9 Woe to him that gathereth together an evil covetousness to his house, that his nest may be on high, and thinketh he may be delivered out
<br>of the hand of evil.
<br>10	Thou hast devised confusion to thy house, thou hast cut off many people, and thy soul hath
<br> 
<br>
<br>sinned.
<br>11	For the stone shall cry out of the wall: and the timber that is between the joints of the build- ing, shall answer.
<br>12	Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and prepareth a city by iniquity.
<br>13	Are not these things from the Lord of hosts? for the people shall labour in a great fire: and the nations in vain, and they shall faint.
<br>14	For the earth shall be filled, that men may know the glory of the Lord, as waters covering the sea.
<br>15	Woe to him that giveth drink to his friend, and presenteth his gall, and maketh him drunk, that he may behold his nakedness.
<br>16	Thou art filled with shame instead of glory: drink thou also, and fall fast asleep: the cup of the right hand of the Lord shall compass thee, and shameful vomiting shall be on thy glory.
<br>17	For the iniquity of Libanus shall cover thee, and the ravaging of beasts shall terrify them be- cause of the blood of men, and the iniquity of the land, and of the city, and of all that dwell therein.
<br>18	What doth the graven thing avail, because the maker thereof hath graven it, a molten, and a false image? because the forger thereof hath trusted in a thing of his own forging, to make dumb idols.
<br>19	Woe to him that saith to wood: Awake: to the dumb stone: Arise: can it teach? Behold, it is laid over with gold, and silver, and there is no spirit in the bowels thereof.
<br>20	But the Lord is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.

<br>A PRAYER OF HABACUC THE PROPHET FOR IGNORANCES.
<br>2	O Lord, I have heard thy hearing, and was afraid. O Lord, thy work, in the midst of the years bring it to life: In the midst of the years thou shalt make it known: when thou art angry, thou wilt remember mercy.
<br>3	God will come from the south, and the holy one from mount Pharan: His glory covered the heavens, and the earth is full of his praise.
<br>4	His brightness shall be as the light: horns are in his hands: There is his strength hid:
<br>5	Death shall go before his face. And the devil shall go forth before his feet.
<br>6	He stood and measured the earth. He be- held, and melted the nations: and the ancient mountains were crushed to pieces. The hills of the world were bowed down by the journeys of his eternity.
<br>7	I saw the tents of Ethiopia for their iniq- uity, the curtains of the land of Madian shall be troubled.
<br>8	Wast thou angry, O Lord, with the rivers? or was thy wrath upon the rivers? or thy in- dignation in the sea? Who will ride upon thy horses: and thy chariots are salvation.
<br>9	Thou wilt surely take up thy bow: accord- ing to the oaths which thou hast spoken to the tribes. Thou wilt divide the rivers of the earth. 10 The mountains saw thee, and were grieved: the great body of waters passed away. The deep put forth its voice: the deep lifted up its hands. 11 The sun and the moon stood still in their habitation, in the light of thy arrows, they shall
<br>go in the brightness of thy glittering spear.
<br>12 In thy anger thou wilt tread the earth un- der foot: in thy wrath thou wilt astonish the nations.
<br> 
<br>13	Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people: for salvation with thy Christ. Thou struckest the head of the house of the wicked: thou hast laid bare his foundation even to the neck.
<br>14	Thou hast cursed his sceptres, the head of his warriors, them that came out as a whirlwind to scatter me. Their joy was like that of him that devoureth the poor man in secret.
<br>15	Thou madest a way in the sea for thy horses, in the mud of many waters.
<br>16	I have heard and my bowels were troubled: my lips trembled at the voice. Let rottenness enter into my bones, and swarm under me. That I may rest in the day of tribulation: that I may go up to our people that are girded.
<br>17	For the fig tree shall not blossom: and there shall be no spring in the vines. The labour of the olive tree shall fail: and the fields shall yield no food: the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls.
<br>18	But I will rejoice in the Lord: and I will joy in God my Jesus.
<br>19	The Lord God is my strength: and he will make my feet like the feet of harts: and he the conqueror will lead me upon my high places singing psalms.

<br>The word of the Lord that came to Sophonias the son of Chusi, the son of Godolias, the son of Amarias, the son of Ezechias, in the days of Josias, the son of Amon king of Juda.
<br>2	Gathering, I will gather together all things from off the face of the land, saith the Lord:
<br>3	I will gather man, and beast, I will gather the birds of the air, and the fishes of the sea: and the ungodly shall meet with ruin: and I will destroy men from off the face of the land, saith the Lord.
<br>4	And I will stretch out my hand upon Juda, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and I will destroy out of this place the remnant of Baal, and the names of the wardens of the temples with the priests:
<br>6	And them that turn away from following af- ter the Lord, and that have not sought the Lord, nor searched after him.
<br>7	Be silent before the face of the Lord God: for the day of the Lord is near, for the Lord hath prepared a victim, he hath sanctified his guests. 8 And it shall come to pass in the day of the victim of the Lord, that I will visit upon the princes, and upon the king’s sons, and upon all
<br>such as are clothed with strange apparel:
<br>9	And I will visit in that day upon every one that entereth arrogantly over the threshold: them that fill the house of the Lord their God
<br> 
<br>with iniquity and deceit.
<br>10	And there shall be in that day, saith the Lord, the noise of a cry from the fish gate, and a howling from the Second, and a great destruction from the hills.
<br>11	Howl, ye inhabitants of the Morter. All the people of Chanaan is hush, all are cut off that were wrapped up in silver.
<br>12	And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search Jerusalem with lamps, and will visit upon the men that are settled on their lees: that say in their hearts: The Lord will not do good, nor will he do evil.
<br>13	And their strength shall become a booty, and their houses as a desert: and they shall build houses, and shall not dwell in them: and they shall plant vineyards, and shall not drink the wine of them.
<br>14	The great day of the Lord is near, it is near and exceeding swift: the voice of the day of the Lord is bitter, the mighty man shall there meet with tribu- lation.
<br>15	That day is a day of wrath, a day of tribu- lation and distress, a day of calamity and misery, a day of darkness and obscurity, a day of clouds and whirlwinds,
<br>16	A day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities, and against the high bulwarks. 17 And I will distress men, and they shall walk like blind men, because they have sinned against the Lord: and their blood shall be poured out as

<br>18 Neither shall their silver and their gold be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the Lord: all the land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy: for he shall make even a speedy destruction of all them that dwell in the land.

<br>Chapter 2
<br>Assemble yourselves together, be gathered to- gether, O nation not worthy to be loved:
<br>2	Before the decree bring forth the day as dust passing away, before the fierce anger of the Lord come upon you, before the day of the Lord’s in- dignation come upon you.
<br>3	Seek the Lord, all ye meek of the earth, you that have wrought his judgment: seek the just, seek the meek: if by any means you may be hid in the day of the Lord’s indignation.
<br>4	For Gaza shall be destroyed, and Ascalon shall be a desert, they shall cast out Azotus at noonday, and Accaron shall be rooted up.
<br>5	Woe to you that inhabit the sea coast, O nation of reprobates: the word of the Lord upon you, O Chanaan, the land of the Philistines, and I will destroy thee, so that there shall not be an inhabitant.
<br>6	And the sea coast shall be the resting place of shepherds, and folds for cattle:
<br>7	And it shall be the portion of him that shall remain of the house of Juda, there they shall feed: in the houses of Ascalon they shall rest in the evening: because the Lord their God will visit them, and bring back their captivity.
<br>8	I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the blasphemies of the children of Ammon, with which they reproached my people, and have mag- nified themselves upon their borders.
<br>9	Therefore as I live, saith the Lord of hosts
<br> 
<br>the God of Israel, Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrha, the dry- ness of thorns, and heaps of salt, and a desert even for ever: the remnant of my people shall make a spoil of them, and the residue of my na- tion shall possess them.
<br>10	This shall befall them for their pride: be- cause they have blasphemed, and have been magnified against the people of the Lord of hosts. 11 The Lord shall be terrible upon them, and shall consume all the gods of the earth: and they shall adore him every man from his own place,
<br>all the islands of the Gentiles.
<br>12	You Ethiopians, also shall be slain with my sword.
<br>13	And he will stretch out his hand upon the north, and will destroy Assyria: and he will make the beautiful city a wilderness, and as a place not passable, and as a desert.
<br>14	And flocks shall lie down in the midst thereof, all the beasts of the nations: and the bittern and the urchin shall lodge in the thresh- old thereof: the voice of the singing bird in the window, the raven on the upper post, for I will consume her strength.
<br>15	This is the glorious city that dwelt in se- curity: that said in her heart: I am, and there is none beside me: how is she become a desert, a place for beasts to lie down in? every one that passeth by her shall hiss, and wag his hand.

<br>lions: her judges are evening wolves, they left nothing for the morning.
<br>4	Her prophets are senseless, men without faith: her priests have polluted the sanctuary, they have acted unjustly against the law.
<br>5	The just Lord is in the midst thereof, he will not do iniquity: in the morning, in the morning he will bring his judgment to light, and it shall not be hid: but the wicked man hath not known shame.
<br>6	I have destroyed the nations, and their tow- ers are beaten down: I have made their ways desert, so that there is none that passeth by: their cities are desolate, there is not a man re- maining, nor any inhabitant.
<br>7	I said: Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt re- ceive correction: and her dwelling shall not per- ish, for all things wherein I have visited her: but they rose early, and corrupted all their thoughts.
<br>8	Wherefore expect me, saith the Lord, in the day of my resurrection that is to come, for my judgment is to assemble the Gentiles, and to gather the kingdoms: and to pour upon them my indignation, all my fierce anger: for with the fire of my jealousy shall all the earth be devoured.
<br>9	Because then I will restore to the people a chosen lip, that all may call upon the name of the Lord, and may serve him with one shoulder. 10 From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia, shall my suppliants, the children of my dispersed peo-
<br>ple, bring me an offering.
<br>11	In that day thou shalt not be ashamed for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me for then I will take away out of the midst of thee thy proud boasters, and thou shalt no more be lifted up because of my holy moun- tain.
<br>12	And I will leave in the midst of thee a poor and needy people: and they shall hope in the name of the Lord.
<br> 
<br>
<br>13	The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies, nor shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for they shall feed, and shall lie down, and there shall be none to make them afraid.
<br>14	Give praise, O daughter of Sion: shout, O Israel: be glad, and rejoice with all thy heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.
<br>15	The Lord hath taken away thy judgment, he hath turned away thy enemies: the king of Israel, the Lord, is in the midst of thee, thou shalt fear evil no more.
<br>16	In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem: Fear not: to Sion: Let not thy hands be weak- ened.
<br>17	The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty, he will save: he will rejoice over thee with gladness, he will be silent in his love, he will be joyful over thee in praise.
<br>18	The triflers that were departed from the law, I will gather together, because they were of thee: that thou mayest no more suffer reproach for them.
<br>19	Behold I will cut off all that have afflicted thee at that time: and I will save her that hal- teth, and will gather her that was cast out: and I will get them praise, and a name, in all the land where they had been put to confusion.
<br>20	At that time, when I will bring you: and at the time that I will gather you: for I will give you a name, and praise among all the people of the earth, when I shall have brought back your captivity before your eyes, saith the Lord.

<br>Chapter 1
<br>
<br>In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, the word of the Lord came by the hand of Aggeus the prophet, to Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, governor of Juda, and to Jesus the son of Josedec the high priest, saying:
<br>2	Thus saith the Lord of hosts, saying: This people saith: The time is not yet come for build- ing the house of the Lord.
<br>3	And the word of the Lord came by the hand of Aggeus the prophet, saying:
<br>4	Is it time for you to dwell in ceiled houses, and this house lie desolate?
<br>5	And now thus saith the Lord of hosts: Set your hearts to consider your ways.
<br>6	You have sowed much, and brought in little: you have eaten, but have not had enough: you have drunk, but have not been filled with drink: you have clothed yourselves, but have not been warmed: and he that hath earned wages, put them into a bag with holes.
<br>7	Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Set your hearts upon your ways:
<br>8	Go up to the mountain, bring timber, and build the house: and it shall be acceptable to me, and I shall be glorified, saith the Lord.
<br>9	You have looked for more, and behold it be- came less, and you brought it home, and I blowed it away: why, saith the Lord of hosts? because
<br> 
<br>my house is desolate, and you make haste every man to his own house.
<br>
<br>10	Therefore the heavens over you were stayed from giving dew, and the earth was hindered from yielding her fruits:
<br>
<br>11	And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the wine, and upon the oil, and upon all that the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon beasts, and upon all the labour of the hands.
<br>
<br>12	Then Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, and Jesus the son of Josedec the high priest, and all the remnant of the people hearkened to the voice of the Lord their God, and to the words of Aggeus the prophet, as the Lord their God sent him to them: and the people feared before the Lord.
<br>
<br>13	And Aggeus the messenger of the Lord, as one of the messengers of the Lord, spoke, saying to the people: I am with you, saith the Lord.
<br>
<br>14	And the Lord stirred up the spirit of Zorob- abel the son of Salathiel governor of Juda, and the spirit of Jesus the son of Josedec the high priest, and the spirit of all the rest of the people: and they went in, and did the work in the house of the Lord of Hosts their God.

<br>3	Speak to Zorobabel the son of Salathiel the governor of Juda, and to Jesus the son of Josedec the high priest, and to the rest of the people, saying:
<br>4	Who is left among you, that saw this house in its first glory? and how do you see it now? is it not in comparison to that as nothing in your eyes?
<br>5	Yet now take courage, O Zorobabel, saith the Lord, and take courage, Jesus the son of Josedec the high priest, and take courage, all ye people of the land, saith the Lord of hosts: and perform (for I am with you, saith the Lord of hosts)

<br>11	In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius the king, the
<br> 
<br>
<br>word of the Lord came to Aggeus the prophet, saying:
<br>12	Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Ask the priests the law, saying:
<br>13	If a man carry sanctified flesh in the skirt of his garment, and touch with his skirt, bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat: shall it be sanctified? And the priests answered, and said: No.
<br>14	And Aggeus said: If one that is unclean by occasion of a soul touch any of all these things, shall it be defiled? And the priests answered, and said: It shall be defiled.
<br>15	And Aggeus answered, and said: So is this people, and so is this nation before my face, saith the Lord, and so is all the work of their hands: and all that they have offered there, shall be de- filed.
<br>16	And now consider in your hearts, from this day and upward, before there was a stone laid upon a stone in the temple of the Lord.
<br>17	When you went to a heap of twenty bushels, and they became ten: and you went into the press, to press out fifty vessels, and they be- came twenty.
<br>18	I struck you with a blasting wind, and all the works of your hand with the mildew and with hail, yet there was none among you that returned to me, saith the Lord.
<br>19	Set your hearts from this day, and hence- forward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth month: from the day that the foundations of the temple of the Lord were laid, and lay it up in your hearts.
<br>20	Is the seed as yet sprung up? or hath the vine, and the fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree as yet flourished? from this day I will bless you.

<br>24	In that day, saith the Lord of hosts, I will take thee, O Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, my servant, saith the Lord, and will make thee as a signet, for I have chosen thee, saith the Lord of hosts.

<br>3	And thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Turn ye to me, saith the Lord of hosts: and I will turn to you, saith the Lord of hosts.

<br>5	Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, shall they live always?
<br>6	But yet my words, and my ordinances, which I gave in charge to my servants the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers, and they returned, and said: As the Lord of hosts thought to do to us according to our ways, and according to our devices, so he hath done to us.
<br>7	In the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month which is called Sabath, in the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to Zacharias the son of Barachias, the son of Addo, the prophet, saying:
<br>8	I saw by night, and behold a man riding
<br> 
<br>upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees, that were in the bottom: and behind him were horses, red, speckled, and white.
<br>9	And I said: What are these, my lord? and the angel that spoke in me, said to me: I will shew thee what these are:
<br>10	And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered, and said: These are they, whom the Lord hath sent to walk through the earth.
<br>11	And they answered the angel of the Lord, that stood among the myrtle trees, and said: We have walked through the earth, and behold all the earth is inhabited, and is at rest.
<br>12	And the angel of the Lord answered, and said: O Lord of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem, and on the cities of Juda, with which thou hast been angry? this is now the seventieth year.
<br>13	And the Lord answered the angel, that spoke in me, good words, comfortable words.
<br>14	And the angel that spoke in me, said to me: Cry thou, saying: Thus saith the Lord of hosts: I am zealous for Jerusalem, and Sion with a great zeal.
<br>15	And I am angry with a great anger with the wealthy nations: for I was angry a little, but they helped forward the evil.
<br>16	Therefore thus saith the Lord: I will return to Jerusalem in mercies: my house shall be built in it, saith the Lord of hosts: and the building line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>17	Cry yet, saying: Thus saith the Lord of hosts: My cities shall yet flow with good things: and the Lord wlll yet comfort Sion, and he will yet choose Jerusalem.
<br>18	And I lifted up my eyes, and saw: and behold four horns.
<br>19	And I said to the angel that spoke in me: What are these? And he said to me: These are the horns that have scattered Juda, and Israel, and Jerusalem.
<br>20	And the Lord shewed me four smiths.
<br>21	And I said: What come these to do? and he spoke, saying: These are the horns which have scattered Juda every man apart, and none of them lifted up his head: and these are come to fray them, to cast down the horns of the na- tions, that have lifted up the horn upon the land of Juda to scatter it.

<br>And I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold a man, with a measuring line in his hand.

<br>3	And behold the angel that spoke in me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him.
<br>4	And he said to him: Run, speak to this young man, saying: Jerusalem shall be inhab- ited without walls, by reason of the multitude of men, and of the beasts in the midst thereof.
<br>5	And I will be to it, saith the Lord, a wall of fire round about: and I will be in glory in the midst thereof.
<br>6	O, O flee ye out of the land of the north, saith the Lord, for I have scattered you into the four winds of heaven, saith the Lord.

<br>7	O Sion, flee, thou that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon:

<br>9	For behold, I lift up my hand upon them, and they shall be a prey to those that served them: and you shall know that the Lord of hosts sent me.
<br>10	Sing praise, and rejoice, O daughter of Sion: for behold I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee: saith the Lord.

<br>And the Lord shewed me Jesus the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord: and Satan stood on his right hand to be his adversary.
<br>2	And the Lord said to Satan: The Lord re- buke thee, O Satan: and the Lord that chose Jerusalem rebuke thee: Is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?
<br>3	And Jesus was clothed with filthy garments: and he stood before the face of the angel.
<br>4	Who answered, and said to them that stood before him, saying: Take away the filthy gar- ments from him. And he said to him: Behold I have taken away thy iniquity, and have clothed
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>thee with change of garments.
<br>5	And he said: Put a clean mitre upon his head: and they put a clean mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments, and the angel of the Lord stood.
<br>6	And the angel of the Lord protested to Jesus, saying:
<br>7	Thus saith the Lord of hosts: If thou wilt walk in my ways, and keep my charge, thou also shalt judge my house, and shalt keep my courts, and I will give thee some of them that are now present here to walk with thee.
<br>8	Hear, O Jesus thou high priest, thou and thy friends that dwell before thee, for they are por- tending men: for behold, I WILL BRING MY SERVANT THE ORIENT.
<br>9	For behold the stone that I have laid before Jesus: upon one stone there are seven eyes: be- hold I will grave the graving thereof, saith the Lord of hosts:  and I will take away the iniquity of that land in one day.
<br>
<br>Chapter 4
<br>And the angel that spoke in me came again: and he waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep.
<br>2	And he said to me: What seest thou? And I said: I have looked, and behold a candlestick all of gold, and its lamp upon the top of it: and the seven lights thereof upon it: and seven funnels for the lights that were upon the top thereof.
<br>3	And two olive trees over it: one upon the right side of the lamp, and the other upon the left side thereof.
<br>4	And I answered, and said to the angel that spoke in me, saying: What are these things, my lord?
<br>5	And the angel that spoke in me answered,
<br> 
<br>and said to me: Knowest thou not what these things are? And I said: No, my lord.
<br>6	And he answered, and spoke to me, saying: This is the word of the Lord to Zorobabel, say- ing: Not with an army, nor by might, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.
<br>7	Who art thou, O great mountain, before Zorobabel? thou shalt become a plain: and he shall bring out the chief stone, and shall give equal grace to the grace thereof.
<br>8	And the word of the Lord came to me, say- ing:
<br>9	The hands of Zorobabel have laid the foun- dations of this house, and his hands shall finish it: and you shall know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me to you.
<br>10	For who hath despised little days? and they shall rejoice, and shall see the tin plummet in the hand of Zorobabel. These are the seven eyes of the Lord, that run to and fro through the whole earth.
<br>11	And I answered, and said to him: What are these two olive trees upon the right side of the candlestick, and upon the left side thereof ? 12 And I answered again, and said to him: What are the two olive branches, that are by the two golden beaks, in which are the funnels
<br>of gold?
<br>13	And he spoke to me, saying: Knowest thou not what these are? And I said: No, my lord.
<br>14	And he said: These are two sons of oil who stand before the Lord of the whole earth.
<br>
<br>Chapter 5
<br>And I turned and lifted up my eyes: and I saw, and behold a volume flying.
<br>2 And he said to me: What seest thou? And I said:  I see a volume flying:  the length thereof
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>is twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cu- bits.
<br>3	And he said to me: This is the curse that goeth forth over the face of the earth: for every thief shall be judged as is there written: and every one that sweareth in like manner shall be judged by it.
<br>4	I will bring it forth, saith the Lord of hosts: and it shall come to the house of the thief, and to the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name: and it shall remain in the midst of his house, and shall consume it, with the timber thereof, and the stones thereof.
<br>5	And the angel went forth that spoke in me, and he said to me: Lift up thy eyes, and see what this is, that goeth forth.
<br>6	And I said: What is it? And he said: This is a vessel going forth. And he said: This is their eye in all the earth.
<br>7	And behold a talent of lead was carried, and behold a woman sitting in the midst of the vessel.
<br>8	And he said: This is wickedness. And he cast her into the midst of the vessel, and cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof.
<br>9	And I lifted up my eyes and looked: and behold there came out two women, and wind was in their wings, and they had wings like the wings of a kite: and they lifted up the vessel between the earth and the heaven.
<br>10	And I said to the angel that spoke in me: Whither do these carry the vessel?
<br>11	And he said to me: That a house may be built for it in the land of Sennaar, and that it may be established, and set there upon its own basis.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 6
<br>And I turned, and lifted up my eyes, and saw: and behold four chariots came out from the midst of two mountains: and the mountains were mountains of brass.
<br>2	In the first chariot were red horses, and in the second chariot black horses.
<br>3	And in the third chariot white horses, and in the fourth chariot grisled horses, and strong ones.
<br>4	And I answered, and said to the angel that spoke in me: What are these, my lord?
<br>5	And the angel answered, and said to me: These are the four winds of the heaven, which go forth to stand before the Lord of all the earth.
<br>6	That in which were the black horses went forth into the land of the north, and the white went forth after them: and the grisled went forth to the land the south.
<br>7	And they that were most strong, went out, and sought to go, and to run to and fro through all the earth.   And he said: Go, walk through- out the earth: and they walked throughout the earth.
<br>8	And he called me, and spoke to me, saying: Behold they that go forth into the land of the north, have quieted my spirit in the land of the north.
<br>9	And the word of the Lord came to me, say- ing:
<br>10	Take of them of the captivity, of Holdai, and of Tobias, and of Idaias; thou shalt come in that day, a shalt go into the house of Josias, the son of Sophonias, who came out of Babylon.
<br>11	And thou shalt take gold and silver: and shalt make crowns, and thou shalt set them on the head of Jesus the son of Josedec, the high priest.
<br>12	And thou shalt speak to him, saying:  Thus
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>saith the Lord of hosts, saying: BEHOLD A MAN, THE ORIENT IS HIS NAME: and under
<br>him shall he spring up, a shall build a temple to the Lord.
<br>13	Yea, he shall build a temple to the Lord: and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit, and rule upon his throne: and he shall be a priest upon his throne, and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.
<br>14	And the crowns shall be to Helem, and Tobias, and Idaias, and to Hem, the son of So- phonias, a memorial in the temple of the Lord.
<br>15	And they that are far off, shall come and shall build in the temple of the Lord: and you shall know that the Lord of hosts sent me to you. But this shall come to pass, if hearing you will hear the voice of the Lord your God.
<br>
<br>Chapter 7
<br>And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that the word of the Lord came to Zacharias, in the fourth day of the ninth month, which is Casleu.
<br>2	When Sarasar, and Rogommelech, and the men that were with him, sent to the house of God, to entreat the face of the Lord:
<br>3	To speak to the priests of the house of the Lord of hosts, and to the prophets, saying: Must I weep in the fifth month, or must I sanctify my- self as I have now done for many years?
<br>4	And the word of the Lord of hosts came to me, saying:
<br>5	Speak to all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying: When you fasted, and mourned in the fifth and the seventh month for these seventy years: did you keep a fast unto me? 6 And when you did eat and drink, did you not eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves?
<br> 
<br>7	Are not these the words which the Lord spoke by the hand of the former prophets, when Jerusalem as yet was inhabited, and was wealthy, both itself and the cities round about it, and there were inhabitants towards the south, and in the plain?
<br>8	And the word of the Lord came to Zacharias, saying:
<br>9	Thus saith the Lord of hosts, saying: Judge ye true judgment, and shew ye mercy and com- passion every man to his brother.
<br>10	And oppress not the widow, and the fa- therless, and the stranger, and the poor: and let not a man devise evil in his heart against his brother.
<br>11	But they would not hearken, and they turned away the shoulder to depart: and they stopped their ears, not to hear.
<br>12	And they made their heart as the adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which the Lord of hosts sent in his spirit by the hand of the former prophets: so a great indignation came from Lord of hosts.
<br>13	And it came to pass that as he spoke, and they heard not: so shall they cry, and I will not hear, saith the Lord of hosts.
<br>14	And I dispersed them throughout all king- doms, which they know not: and the land was left desolate behind them, so that no man passed through or returned: and they changed the de- lightful land into a wilderness.
<br>
<br>Chapter 8
<br>And the word of the Lord of hosts came to me, saying:
<br>2 Thus saith the Lord of hosts: I have been jealous for Sion with a great jealousy, and with a great indignation have I been jealous for her.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>3	Thus saith the Lord of hosts: I am re- turned to Sion, and I will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called The city of truth, and the mountain of the Lord of hosts, The sanctified mountain.
<br>4	Thus saith the Lord of hosts: There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem: and every man with his staff in his hand through multitude of days.
<br>5	And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls, playing in the streets thereo.
<br>6	Thus saith the Lord of hosts: If it seem hard in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days: shall it be hard in my eyes, saith the Lord of hosts?
<br>7	Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Behold I will save my people from the land of the east, and from the land of the going down of the sun.
<br>8	And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God in truth and in justice.
<br>9	Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Let your hands be strengthened, you that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets, in the day that the house of the Lord of hosts was founded, that the temple might be built.
<br>11	But now I will not deal with the remnant of this people according to the former days, saith the Lord of hosts.
<br>12	But there shall be the seed of peace: the vine shall yield her fruit, and the earth shall give her increase, and the heavens shall give their dew: and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things.
<br>13	And it shall come to pass, that as you were a curse among the Gentiles, O house of Juda, and house of Israel: so will I save you, and you shall be a blessing: fear not, let your hands be strengthened.
<br> 
<br>14	For thus saith the Lord of hosts: As I pur- posed io afflict you, when your fathers had pro- voked me to wrath, saith the Lord,
<br>15	And I had no mercy: so turning again I have thought in these days to do good to the house of Juda, and Jerusalem: fear not.
<br>16	These then are the things, which you shall do: Speak ye truth every one to his neighbour; judge ye truth and judgment of peace in your gates.
<br>17	And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his friend: and love not a false oath: for all these are the things that I hate, saith the Lord.
<br>18	And the word of the Lord of hosts came to me, saying:
<br>19	Thus saith the Lord of hosts: The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth shall be to the house of Juda, joy, and gladness, and great solemnities: only love ye truth and peace.
<br>20	Thus saith the Lord of hosts, until people come and dwell in many cities,
<br>21	And the inhabitants go one to another, say- ing: Let us go, and entreat the face of the Lord, and let us seek the Lord of hosts: I also will go.
<br>22	And many peoples, and strong nations shall come to seek the Lord of hosts in Jerusalem, and to entreat the face of the Lord.
<br>23	Thus saith the Lord of hosts: In those days, wherein ten men of all languages of the Gentiles shall take hold, and shall hold fast the skirt of one that is a Jew, saying: We will go with you: for we have heard that God is with you.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 9
<br>The burden of the word of the Lord in the land of Hadrach, and of Damascus the rest thereof: for the eye of man, and of all the tribes of Israel is the Lord’s.
<br>2	Emath also in the borders thereof, and Tyre, and Sidon: for they have taken to themselves to be exceeding wise.
<br>3	And Tyre hath built herself a strong hold, and heaped together silver as earth, and gold as the mire of the streets.
<br>4	Behold the Lord shall possess her, and shall strike her strength in the sea, and she shall be devoured with fire.
<br>5	Ascalon shall see, and shall fear, and Gaza, and shall be very sorrowful: and Accaron, be- cause her hope is confounded: and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ascalon shall not be in- habited.
<br>6	And the divider shall sit in Azotus, and I will destroy the pride of the Philistines.
<br>7	And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth: and even he shall be left to our God, and he shall be as a governor in Juda, and Accaron as a Jebusite.
<br>8	And I will encompass my house with them that serve me in war, going and returning, and the oppressor shall no more pass through them: for now I have seen with my eyes.
<br>9	Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Sion, shout for joy, O daughter of Jerusalem: BEHOLD THY KING will come to thee, the just and saviour: he is poor, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt, the foal of an ass.
<br>10	And I will destroy the chariot out of Ephraim, and the horse out of Jerusalem, and the bow for war shall be broken: and he shall speak peace to the Gentiles, and his power shall
<br> 
<br>be from sea to sea, and from the rivers even to the end of the earth.
<br>11	Thou also by the blood of thy testament hast sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit, wherein is no water.
<br>12	Return to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope, I will render thee double as I declare today. 13 Because I have bent Juda for me as a bow,
<br>I have filled Ephraim: and I will raise up thy sons, O Sion, above thy sons, O Greece, and I will make thee as the sword of the mighty.
<br>14	And the Lord God shall be seen over them, and his dart shall go forth as lightning: and the Lord God will sound the trumpet, and go in the whirlwind of the south.
<br>15	The Lord of hosts will protect them: and they shall devonr, and subdue with the stones of the sling: and drinking they shall be inebriated as it were with wine, and they shall be filled as bowls, and as the horns of the altar.
<br>16	And the Lord their God will save them in that day, as the flock of his people: for holy stones shall be lifted up over his land.
<br>17	For what is the good thing of him, and what is his beautiful thing, but the corn of the elect, and wine springing forth virgins?
<br>
<br>Chapter 10
<br>Ask ye of the Lord rain in the latter season, and the Lord will make snows, and will give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the field.
<br>2	For the idols have spoken what was unprof- itable, and the diviners have seen a lie, and the dreamers have spoken vanity: they comforted in vain: therefore they were led away as a flock: they shall be afflicted, because they have no shepherd.
<br>3	My wrath is kindled against the shepherds,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>and I will visit upon the buck goats: for the Lord of hosts hath visited his flock, the house of Juda, and hath made them as the horse of his glory in the battle.
<br>4	Out of him shall come forth the corner, out of him the pin, out of him the bow of battle, out of him ever exacter together.
<br>5	And they shall be as mighty men, treading under foot the mire of the ways in battle: and they shall fight, because the Lord is with them, and the riders of horses shall be confounded.
<br>6	And I will strengthen the house of Juda, and save the house of Joseph: and I will bring them back again, because I will have mercy on them: and they shall be as they were when I had not cast them off, for I am the Lord their God, and will hear them.
<br>7	And they shall be as the valiant men of Ephraim, and their heart shall rejoice as through wine: and their children shall see, and shall re- joice, and their heart shall be joyful in the Lord. 8 I will whistle for them, and I will gather them together, because I have redeemed them: and I will multiply them as they were multiplied
<br>before.
<br>9	And I will sow them among peoples: and from afar they shall remember me: and they shall live with their children, and shall return.
<br>10	And I will bring them back out of the land of Egypt, and I will gather them from among the Assyrians: and will bring them to the land of Galaad, and Libanus, and place shall not be found for them.
<br>11	And he shall pass over the strait of the sea, and shall strike the waves in the sea, and all the depths of the river shall be confounded, and the pride of Assyria shall be humbled, and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart.
<br>12	I will strengthen them in the Lord, and they shall walk in his name, saith the Lord.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 11
<br>Open thy gates, O Libanus, and let fire devour thy cedars.
<br>2	Howl, thou fir tree, for the cedar is fallen, for the mighty are laid waste: howl, ye oaks of Basan, because the fenced forest is cut down.
<br>3	The voice of the howling of the shepherds, because their glory is laid waste: the voice of the roaring of the lions, because the pride of the Jordan is spoiled.
<br>4	Thus saith the Lord my God: Feed the flock of the slaughter,
<br>5	Which they that possessed, slew, and re- pented not, and they sold them, saying: Blessed be the Lord, we are become rich: and their shep- herds spared them not.
<br>6	And I will no more spare the inhabitants of the land, saith the Lord: behold I will deliver the men, every one into his neighbour’s hand, and into the hand of his king: and they shall destroy the land, and I will not deliver it out of their hand.
<br>7	And I will feed the flock of slaughter for this, O ye poor of the flock. And I took unto me two rods, one I called Beauty, and the other I called a Cord, and I fed the flock.
<br>8	And I cut off three shepherds in one month, and my soul was straitened in their regard: for their soul also varied in my regard.
<br>9	And I said: I will not feed you: that which dieth, let it die: and that which is cut off, let it be cut off: and let the rest devour every one the flesh of his neighbour.
<br>10	And I took my rod that was called Beauty, and I cut it asunder to make void my covenant, which I had made with all people.
<br>11	And it was made void in that day: and so the poor of the flock that keep for me, under- stood that it is the word of the Lord.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>12	And I said to them: If it be good in your eyes, bring hither my wages: and if not, be quiet. And they weighed for my wages thirty pieces of silver.
<br>13	And the Lord said to me: Cast it to the statuary, a handsome price, that I was prized at by them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and I cast them into the house of the Lord to the statuary.
<br>14	And I cut off my second rod that was called a Cord, that I might break the brotherhood be- tween Juda and Israel.
<br>15	And the Lord said to me: Take to thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd.
<br>16	For behold I will raise up a shepherd in the land, who shall not visit what is forsaken, nor seek what is scattered, nor heal what is broken, nor nourish that which standeth, and he shall eat the flesh of the fat ones, and break their hoofs.
<br>17	O shepherd, and idol, that forsaketh the flock: the sword upon his arm and upon his right eye: his arm shall quite wither away, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.
<br>
<br>Chapter 12
<br>The burden of the word of the Lord upon Israel. Thus saith the Lord, who stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundations of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man in him:
<br>2	Behold I will make Jerusalem a lintel of sur- feiting to all the people round about: and Juda also shall be in the siege against Jerusalem.
<br>3	And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will make Jerusalem a burdensome stone to all people: all that shall lift it up shall be rent and torn, and all the kingdoms of the earth shall be gathered together against her.
<br>4	In that day, saith the Lord, I will strike ev-
<br> 
<br>ery horse with astonishment, and his rider with madness: and I will open my eyes upon the house of Juda, and will strike every horse of the nations with blindness.
<br>5	And the governors of Juda shall say in their heart: Let the inhabitants of Jerusalem be strengthened for me in the Lord of hosts, their God.
<br>6	In that day I will make the governors of Juda like a furnace of fire amongst wood, and as a firebrand amongst hay: and they shall devour all the people round about, to the right hand, and to the left: and Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place in Jerusalem.
<br>7	And the Lord shall save the tabernacles of Jada, as in the beginning:    that the house of David, and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, may not boast and magnify them- selves against Juda.
<br>8	In that day shall the Lord protect the inhab- itants of Jerusalem, and he that hath offended among them in that day shall be as David: and the house of David, as that of God, as an angel of the Lord in their sight.
<br>9	And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.
<br>10	And I will pour out upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace, and of prayers: and they shall look upon me, whom they have pierced: and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for an only son, and they shall grieve over him, as the manner is to grieve for the death of the firstborn.
<br>11	In that day there shall be a great lamen- tation in Jerusalem like the lamentation of Adadremmon in the plain of Mageddon.
<br>12	And the land shall mourn: families and families apart: the families of the house of David
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>apart, and their women apart:
<br>13	The families of the house of Nathan apart, and their women apart: the families of the house of Levi apart, and their women apart: the fami- lies of Semei apart, and their women apart.
<br>14	All the rest of the families, families and families apart, and their women apart.
<br>
<br>Chapter 13
<br>In that day there shall be a fountain open to the house of David, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem: for the washing of the sinner, and of the unclean woman.
<br>2	And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord of hosts, that I will destroy the names of idols out of the earth, and they shall be re- membered no more: and I will take away the false prophets, and the unclean spirit out of the earth.
<br>3	And it shall come to pass, that when any man shall prophesy any more, his father and his mother that brought him into the world, shall say to him: Thou shalt not live: because thou hast spoken a lie in the name of the Lord. And his father, and his mother, his parents, shall thrust him through, when he shall prophesy.
<br>4	And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall be confounded, every one by his own vision, when he shall prophesy, neither shall they be clad with a garment of sackcloth, to deceive:
<br>5	But he shall say: I am no prophet, I am a husbandman: for Adam is my example from my youth.
<br>6	And they shall say to him: What are these wounds in the midst of thy hands? And he shall say: With these I was wounded in the house of them that loved me.
<br> 
<br>7	Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that cleaveth to me, saith the Lord of hosts: strike the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered: and I will turn my hand to the little ones.
<br>8	And there shall be in all the earth, saith the Lord, two parts in it shall be scattered, and shall perish: but the third part shall be left therein.
<br>9	And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined: and I will try them as gold is tried. They shall call on my name, and I will hear them. I will say: Thou art my people: and they shall say: The Lord is my God.
<br>
<br>Chapter 14
<br>Behold the days of the Lord shall come, and thy spoils shall be divided in the midst of thee.
<br>2	And I will gather all nations to Jerusalem to battle, and the city shall be taken, and the houses shall be rifled, and the women shall be defiled: and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, and the rest of the people shall not be taken away out of the city.
<br>3	Then the Lord shall go forth, and shall fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle.
<br>4	And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which is over against Jerusalem towards the east: and the mount of Olives shall be divided in the midst thereof to the east, and to the west with a very great opening, and half of the mountain shall be separated to the north, and half thereof to the south.
<br>5	And you shall flee to the valley of those mountains, for the valley of the mountains shall be joined even to the next, and you shall flee as you fled from the face of the earthquake in the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>days of Ozias king of Juda: and the Lord my God shall come, and all the saints with him.
<br>6	And it shall come to pass in that day, that there shall be no light, but cold and frost.
<br>7	And there shall be one day, which is known to the Lord, not day nor night: and in the time of the evening there shall be light:
<br>8	And it shall come to pass in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem: half of them to the east sea, and half of them to the last sea: they shall be in summer and in winter. 9 And the Lord shall be king over all the earth: in that day there shall be one Lord, and his name
<br>shall be one.
<br>10 And all the land shall return even to the desert, from the hill to Remmon to the south of Jerusalem: and she shall be exalted, and shall dwell in her own place, from the gate of Ben- jamin even to the place of the former gate, and even to the gate of the corners: and from the tower of Hananeel even to the king’s winepresses. 11 And people shall dwell in it, and there shall be no more an anathema: but Jerusalem shall sit
<br>secure.
<br>12	And this shall be the plague wherewith the Lord shall strike all nations that have fought against Jerusalem: the flesh of every one shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth.
<br>13	In that day there shall be a great tumult from the Lord among them: and a man shall take the hand of his neighbour, and his hand shall be clasped upon his neighbour’s hand.
<br>14	And even Juda shall fight against Jerusalem: and the riches of all nations round about shall be gathered together, gold, and sil- ver, and garments in great abundance.
<br>15	And the destruction of the horse,  and of
<br> 
<br>the mule, and of the camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts, that shall be in those tents, shall be like this destruction.
<br>16	And all they that shall be left of all nations that came against Jerusalem, shall go up from year to year, to adore the King, the Lord of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles.
<br>17	And it shall come to pass, that he that shall not go up of the families of the land to Jerusalem, to adore the King, the Lord of hosts, there shall be no rain upon them.
<br>18	And if the family of Egypt go not up nor come: neither shall it be upon them, but there shall be destruction wherewith the Lord will strike all nations that will not go up to keep the feast of tabernacles.
<br>19	This shall be the sin of Egypt, and this the sin of all nations, that will not go up to keep the feast of tabernacles.
<br>20	In that day that which is upon the bridle of the horse shall be holy to the Lord: and the caldrons in the house of the Lord shall be as the phials before the altar.
<br>21	And every caldron in Jerusalem and Juda shall be sanctified to the Lord of hosts: and all that sacrifice shall come, and take of them, and shall seethe in them: and the merchant shall be no more in the house of the Lord of hosts in that day.

<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>
<br>The burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by the hand of Malachias.
<br>2	I have loved you, saith the Lord: and you have said: Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau brother to Jacob, saith the Lord, and I have loved Jacob,
<br>3	But have hated Esau? and I have made his mountains a wilderness, and given his inher- itance to the dragons of the desert.
<br>4	But if Edom shall say: We are destroyed, but we will return and build up what hath been destroyed: thus saith the Lord of hosts: They shall build up, and I will throw down: and they shall be called the borders of wickedness, and the people with whom the Lord is angry for ever.
<br>5	And your eyes shall see: and you shall say: The Lord be magnified upon the border of Israel. 6 The son honoureth the father, and the ser- vant his master: if then I be a father, where is my honour? and if I be a master, where is my
<br>fear: saith the Lord of hosts.
<br>7	To you, O priests, that despise my name, and have said: Wherein have we despised thy name? You offer polluted bread upon my altar, and you say: Wherein have we polluted thee? In that you say: The table of the Lord is con- temptible.
<br>8	If you offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if you offer the lame and the sick, is
<br> 
<br>it not evil? offer it to thy prince, if he will be pleased with it, or if he will regard thy face, saith the Lord of hosts.
<br>9	And now beseech ye the face of God, that he may have mercy on you, (for by your hand hath this been done,) if by any means he will receive your faces, saith the Lord of hosts.
<br>10	Who is there among you, that will shut the doors, and will kindle the fire on my altar gratis? I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord of hosts: and I will not receive a gift of your hand.
<br>11	For from the rising of the sun even to the going down, my name is great among the Gen- tiles, and in every place there is sacrifice, and there is offered to my name a clean oblation: for my name is great among the Gentiles, saith the Lord of hosts.
<br>12	And you have profaned it in that you say: The table of the Lord is defiled: and that which is laid thereupon is contemptible with the fire that devoureth it.
<br>13	And you have said: Behold of our labour, and you puffed it away, saith the Lord of hosts, and you brought in of rapine the lame, and the sick, and brought in an offering: shall I accept it at your hands, saith the Lord?
<br>14	Cursed is the deceitful man that hath in his flock a male, and making a vow offereth in sacrifice that which is feeble to the Lord: for I am a great King, saith the Lord of hosts, and my name is dreadful among the Gentiles.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 2
<br>And now, O ye priests, this commandment is to you.
<br>2	If you will not hear, and if you will not lay it to heart, to give glory to my name, saith the Lord of hosts: I will send poverty upon you, and will curse your blessings, yea I will curse them, because you have not laid it to heart.
<br>3	Behold, I will cast the shoulder to you, and will scatter upon your face the dung of your solemnities, and it shall take you away with it.
<br>4	And you shall know that I sent you this commandment, that my covenant might be with Levi, saith the Lord of hosts.
<br>5	My covenant was with him of life and peace: and I gave him fear: and he feared me, and he was afraid before my name.
<br>6	The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniq- uity was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace, and in equity, and turned many away from iniquity.
<br>7	For the lips of the priests shall keep knowl- edge, and they shall seek the law at his mouth: because he is the angel of the Lord of hosts.
<br>8	But you have departed out of the way, and have caused many to stumble at the law: you have made void the covenant of Levi, saith the Lord of hosts.
<br>9	Therefore have I also made you con- temptible, and base before all people, as you have not kept my ways, and have accepted per- sons in the law.
<br>10	Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why then doth every one of us despise his brother, violating the covenant of our fathers?
<br>11	Juda hath transgressed, and abomination hath been committed in Israel, and in Jerusalem: for Juda hath profaned the holiness of the Lord,
<br> 
<br>which he loved, and hath married the daughter of a strange god.
<br>12	The Lord will cut off the man that hath done this, both the master, and the scholar, out of the tabernacles of Jacob, and him that offereth an offering to the Lord of hosts.
<br>13	And this again have you done, you have covered the altar of the Lord with tears, with weeping, and bellowing, so that I have no more a regard to sacrifice, neither do I accept any atone- ment at your hands.
<br>14	And you have said: For what cause? Be- cause the Lord hath been witness between thee, and the wife of thy youth, whom thou hast de- spised: yet she was thy partner, and the wife of thy covenant.
<br>15	Did not one make her, and she is the residue of his spirit? And what doth one seek, but the seed of God? Keep then your spirit, and despise not the wife of thy youth.
<br>16	When thon shalt hate her put her away, saith the Lord, the God of lsrael: but iniquity shalt cover his garment, saith the Lord of hosts, keep your spirit, and despise not.
<br>17	You have wearied the Lord with your words, and you said: Wherein have we wearied him? In that you say: Every one that doth evil, is good in the sight of the Lord, and such please him: or surely where is the God of judgment?
<br>
<br>Chapter 3
<br>Behold I send my angel, and he shall prepare the way before my face. And presently the Lord, whom you seek, and the angel of the testament, whom you desire, shall come to his temple. Be- hold, he cometh, saith the Lord of hosts.
<br>2 And who shall be able to think of the day of his coming? and who shall stand to see him?
<br> 
<br>
<br>1186	Prophecy of Malachias
<br>
<br> 
<br>for he is like a refining fire, and like thc fuller’s herb:
<br>3	And he shall sit refining and cleansing the silver, and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and shall refine them as gold, and as silver, and they shall offer sacrifices to the Lord in justice.
<br>4	And the sacrifice of Juda and of Jerusalem shall please the Lord, as in the days of old, and in the ancient years.
<br>5	And I will come to you in judgment, and will be a speedy witness against sorcerers, and adul- terers, and false swearers, and them that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widows, and the fa- therless: and oppress the stranger, and have not feared me, saith the Lord of hosts.
<br>6	For I am the Lord, and I change not: and you the sons of Jacob are not consumed.
<br>7	For from the days of your fathers you have departed from my ordinances, and have not kept them: Return to me, and I will return to you, saith the Lord of hosts. And you have said: Wherein shall we return?
<br>8	Shall a man afflict God, for you afflict me. And you have said: Wherein do we afflict thee? in tithes and in firstfruits.
<br>9	And you are cursed with want, and you af- flict me, even the whole nation of you.
<br>10	Bring all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in my house, and try me in this, saith the Lord: if I open not unto you the flood-gates of heaven, and pour you out a blessing even to abundance.
<br>11	And I will rebuke for your sakes the de- vourer, and he shall not spoil the fruit of your land: neither shall the vine in the field be barren, saith the Lord of hosts.
<br>12	And all nations shall call you blessed: for you shall be a delightful land, saith the Lord of hosts.
<br> 
<br>13	Your words have been unsufferable to me, saith the Lord.
<br>14	And you have said: What have we spoken against thee? You have said: He laboureth in vain that serveth God, and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinances, and that we have walked sorrowful before the Lord of hosts?
<br>15	Wherefore now we call the proud people happy, for they that work wickedness are built up, and they have tempted God and are pre- served.
<br>16	Then they that feared the Lord, spoke ev- ery one with his neighbour: and the Lord gave ear, and heard it: and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that fear the Lord, and think on his name.
<br>17	And they shall be my special possession, saith the Lord of hosts, in the day that I do judg- ment: and I will spare them, as a man spareth his son that serveth him.
<br>18	And you shall return, and shall see the dif- ference between the just and the wicked: and between him that serveth God, and him that serveth him not.
<br>
<br>Chapter 4
<br>For behold the day shall come kindled as a fur- nace: and all the proud, and all that do wickedly shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall set them on fire, saith the Lord of hosts, it shall not leave them root, nor branch.
<br>2	But unto you that fear my name, the Sun of justice shall arise, and health in his wings: and you shall go forth, and shall leap like calves of the herd.
<br>3	And you shall tread down the wicked when they shall be ashes under the sole of your feet in the day that I do this, saith the Lord of hosts.
<br> 
<br>
<br>4	Remember the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded him in Horeb for all Israel, the precepts, and judgments.
<br>5	Behold, I will send you Elias the prophet, before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.
<br>6	And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers: lest I come, and strike the earth with anathema.

<br>First Book of Machabees
<br>
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>Now it came to pass, after that Alexander the son of Philip the Macedonian, who first reigned in Greece, coming out of the land of Cethim, had overthrown Darius, king of the Persians and Medes:
<br>2	He fought many battles, and took the strong holds of all, and slew the kings of the earth:
<br>3	And he went through even to the ends of the earth: and took the spoils of many nations: and the earth was quiet before him.
<br>4	And he gathered a power, and a very strong army: and his heart was exalted and lifted up:
<br>5	And he subdued countries of nations, and princes; and they became tributaries to him.
<br>6	And after these things, he fell down upon his bed, and knew that he should die.
<br>7	And he called his servants, the nobles that were brought up with him from his youth: and he divided his kingdom among them, while he was yet alive.
<br>8	And Alexander reigned twelve years, and he died.
<br>9	And his servants made themselves kings, ev- ery one in his place:
<br>10	And they all put crowns upon themselves after his death, and their sons after them, many years; and evils were multiplied in the earth.
<br>11	And there came out of them a wicked root, Antiochus the Illustrious, the son of king Anti- ochus, who had been a hostage at Rome: and he
<br> 
<br>
<br>reigned in the hundred and thirty-seventh year of the kingdom of the Greeks.
<br>12	In those days there went out of Israel wicked men, and they persuaded many, saying: Let us go and make a covenant with thc heathens that are round about us: for since we departed from them, many evils have befallen us.
<br>13	And the word seemed good in their eyes.
<br>14	And some of the people determined to do this, and went to the king: and he gave them license to do after the ordinances of the heathens.
<br>15	And they built a place of excercise in Jerusalem, according to the laws of the nations: 16 And they made themselves prepuces, and departed from the holy covenant, and joined themselves to the heathens, and were sold to do
<br>evil:
<br>17	And the kingdom was established before Antiochus, and he had a mind to reign over the land of Egypt, that he might reign over two king- doms.
<br>18	And he entered into Egypt with a great multitude, with chariots, and elephants, and horsemen, and a great number of ships:
<br>19	And he made war against Ptolemee king of Egypt; but Ptolemee was afraid at his presence and fled, and many were wounded unto death.
<br>20	And he took the strong cities in the land of Egypt: and he took the spoils of the land of Egypt.
<br>21	And after Antiochus had ravaged Egypt, in the hundred and forty-third year, he returned
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>and went up against Israel.
<br>22	And he went up to Jerusalem, with a great multitude.
<br>23	And he proudly entered into the sanctuary, and took away the golden altar, and the candle- stick of light, and all the vessels thereof, and the table of proposition, and the pouring vessels, and the vials, and the little mortars of gold, and the veil, and the crowns, and the golden ornament that was before the temple: and he broke them all in pieces.
<br>24	And he took the silver and gold, and the precious vessels: and he took the hidden trea- sures, which he found: and when he had taken all away, he departed into his own country.
<br>25	And he made a great slaughter of men, and spoke very proudly.
<br>26	And there was great mourning in Israel, and in every place where they were:
<br>27	And the princes, and the ancients mourned, and the virgins and the young men were made feeble, and the beauty of the women was changed.
<br>28	Every bridegroom took up lamentation: and the bride that sat in the marriage bed, mourned:
<br>29	And the land was moved for the inhab- itants thereof, and all the house of Jacob was covered with confusion.
<br>30	And after two full years, the king sent the chief collector of his tributes to the cities of Juda, and he came to Jerusalem with a great multi- tude.
<br>31	And he spoke to them peaceable words in deceit; and they believed him.
<br>32	And he fell upon the city suddenly, and struck it with a great slaughter, and destroyed much people in Israel.
<br>33	And he took the spoils of the city, and burnt it with fire, and threw down the houses
<br> 
<br>thereof, and the walls thereof round about:
<br>34	And they took the women captive, and the chil- dren, and the cattle they possessed.
<br>35	And they built the city of David with a great and strong wall, and with strong towers, and made it a fortress for them:
<br>36	And they placed there a   sinful   na- tion, wicked men, and they fortified themselves therein: and they stored up armour;and victuals, and gathered together the spoils of Jerusalem;
<br>37	And laid them up there: and they became a great snare.
<br>38	And this was a place to lie in wait against the sanctuary, and an evil devil in Israel.
<br>39	And they shed innocent blood round about the sanctuary, and defiled the holy place.
<br>40	And the inhabitants of Jerusalem fled away by reason of them and the city was made the habitation of strangers, and she became a stranger to her own seed, and her children for- sook her.
<br>41	Her sanctuary was desolate like a wilder- ness, her festival days were turned into mourn- ing, her sabbaths into reproach, her honours were brought to nothing.
<br>42	Her dishonour was increased according to her glory, and her excellency was turned into mourning.
<br>43	And king Antiochus wrote to all his king- dom, that all the people should be one: and ev- ery one should leave his own law.
<br>44	And all nations consented, according to the word of king Antiochus.
<br>46	And the king sent letters by the hands of messengers to Jerusalem, and to all the cities of Juda; that they should follow the law of the nations of the earth.
<br>47	And should forbid holocausts and sacri- fices, and atonements to be made in the temple of God.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>48	And should prohibit the sabbath, and the festival days to be celebrated.
<br>49	And he commanded the holy places to be profaned, and the holy people of Israel.
<br>50	And he commanded altars to be built, and temples, and idols, and swine’s flesh to be im- molated, and unclean beasts,
<br>51	And that they should leave their children uncircumcised, and let their souls be defiled with all uncleannesses, and abominations, to the end that they should forget the law, and should change all the justifications of God.
<br>52	And that whosoever would not do accord- ing to the word of king Antiochus, should be put to death.
<br>53	According to all these words he wrote to his whole kingdom: and he appointed rulers over the people that should force them to do these things. 54 And they commanded the cities of Juda to
<br>sacrifice.
<br>55	Then many of the people were gathered to them that had forsaken the law of the Lord: and they committed evils in the land:
<br>56	And they drove away the people of Israel into lurking holes, and into the secret places of fugitives.
<br>57	On the fifteenth day of the month, Casleu, in the hundred and forty-fifth year, king Anti- ochus set up the abominable idol of desolation upon the altar of God, and they built altars throughout all the cities of Juda round about:
<br>58	And they burnt incense, and sacrificed at the doors of the houses and in the streets.
<br>59	And they cut in pieces, and burnt with fire the books of the law of God:
<br>60	And every one with whom the books of the testament of the Lord were found, and whoso- ever observed the law of the Lord, they put to death, according to the edict of the king.
<br> 
<br>61	Thus by their power did they deal with the people of Israel, that were found in the cities month after month.
<br>62	And on the five and twentieth day of the month they sacrificed upon the altar of the idol that was over against the altar of God.
<br>63	Now the women that circumcised their chil- dren were slain according to the commandment of king Antiochus,
<br>64	And they hanged the children about their neck in all their houses: and those that had cir- cumcised them, they put to death.
<br>65	And many of the people of Israel deter- mined with themselves, that they would not eat unclean things: and they chose rather to die, than to be defiled with unclean meats:
<br>66	And they would not break the holy law of God and they were put to death:
<br>67	And there was very great wrath upon the people. . j; 1 Machabees Chapter 2
<br>In those days arose Mathathias, the son of John, the son of Simeon, a priest of the sons of Joarib, from Jerusalem, and he abode in the mountain of Modin:
<br>2	And he had five sons: John, who was sur- named Gaddis:
<br>3	And Simon, who was surnamed Thasi;
<br>4	And Judas, who was called Machabeus;
<br>5	And Eleazar, who was surnamed Abaron; and Jonathan, who was surnamed Apphus.
<br>6	These saw the evils that were done in the people of Juda, and in Jerusalem.
<br>7	And Mathathias said: Woe is me, wherefore was I born to see the ruin of my people, and the ruin of the holy city, and to dwell there, when it is given into the hands of the enemies?
<br>8	The holy places are come into the hands of strangers her temple is become as a man without honour.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>9	The vessels of her glory are carried away captive; her old men are murdered in the streets, and her young men are fallen by the sword of the enemies.
<br>10	What nation hath not inherited her king- dom, and gotten of her spoils?
<br>11	All her ornaments are taken away. She that was free is made a slave.
<br>12	And behold our sanctuary, and our beauty, and our glory is laid waste, and the Gentiles have defiled them.
<br>13	To what end then should we live any longer?
<br>14	And Mathathias and his sons rent their garments, and they covered themselves with haircloth, and made great lamentation.
<br>15	And they that were sent from king Anti- ochus, came thither, to compel them that were fled into the city of Modin, to sacrifice, and to burn incense, and to depart from the law of God. 16 And many of the people of Israel consented and came to them: but Mathathias and his sons
<br>stood firm.
<br>17	And they that were sent from Antiochus, answering, said to Mathathias: Thou art a ruler, and an honourable, and great man in this city, and adorned with sons, and brethren.
<br>18	Therefore, come thou first, and obey the king’s commandment, as all nations have done, and the men of Juda, and they that remain in Jerusalem: and thou, and thy sons shall be in the number of the king’s friends, and enriched with gold, and silver, and many presents.
<br>19	Then Mathathias answered, and said with a loud voice: Although all nations obey king An- tiochus, so as to depart every man from the ser- vice of the law of his fathers, and consent to his commandments:
<br>20	I and my sons, and my brethren will obey the law of our fathers.
<br> 
<br>21	God be merciful unto us: it is not profitable for us to forsake the law, and the justices of God:
<br>22	We will not hearken to the words of king Antiochus, neither will we sacrifice and transgress the commandments of our law, to go another way.
<br>23	Now as he left off speaking these words, there came a certain Jew in the sight of all to sacrifice to the idols upon the altar in the city of Modin, according to the king’s commandment.
<br>24	And Mathathias saw, and was grieved, and his reins trembled, and his wrath was kindled ac- cording to the judgment of the law, and running upon him he slew him upon the altar:
<br>25	Moreover the man whom king Antiochus had sent, who compelled them to sacrifice, he slew at the same time, and pulled down the altar, 26 And shewed zeal for the law, as Phinees
<br>did by Zamri, the son of Salomi.
<br>27	And Mathathias cried out in the city with a loud voice, saying: Every one that hath zeal for the law, and maintaineth the testament, let him follow me.
<br>28	So he and his sons fled into the mountains, and left all that they had in the city.
<br>29	Then many that sought after judgment, and justice, went down into the desert
<br>30	And they abode there, they and their chil- dren, and their wives, and their cattle: because afflictions increased upon them.
<br>31	And it was told to the king’s men, and to the army that was in Jerusalem, in the city of David, that certain men, who had broken the king’s commandment, were gone away into the secret places in the wilderness, and that many were gone after them.
<br>32	And forthwith they went out towards them, and made war against them on the sabbath day. 33 And they said to them: Do you still resist? come forth, and do according to the edict of king
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Antiochus, and you shall live.
<br>34	And they said: We will not come forth, neither will we obey the king’s edict, to profane the sabbath day.
<br>35	And they made haste to give them battle. 36 But they answered them not, neither did they cast a stone at them, nor stopped up the
<br>secret places,
<br>37	Saying: Let us all die in our innocency: and heaven and earth shall be witnesses for us, that you put us to death wrongfully.
<br>38	So they gave them battle on the sabbath: and they were slain, with their wives, and their children, and their cattle, to the number of a thousand persons.
<br>39	And Mathathias and his friends heard of it, and they mourned for them exceedingly.
<br>40	And every man said to his neighbour: If we shall all do as our brethren have done, and not fight against the heathens for our lives, and our justifications, they will now quickly root us out of the earth.
<br>41	And they determined in that day, saying: Whosoever shall come up against us to fight on the sabbath day, we will fight against him: and we will not all die, as our brethren that were slain in the secret places.
<br>42	Then was assembled to them the congre- gation of the Assideans, the stoutest of Israel, every one that had a good will for the law.
<br>43	And all they that fled from the evils, joined themselves to them, and were a support to them. 44 And they gathered an army, and slew the sinners in their wrath, and the wicked men in their indignation: and the rest fled to the nations
<br>for safety.
<br>45	And Mathathias and his friends went round about, and they threw down the altars:
<br>46	And they circumcised all the children whom they found in the confines of Israel that
<br> 
<br>were uncircumcised: and they did valiantly.
<br>47	And they pursued after the children of pride, and the work prospered in their hands:
<br>48	And they recovered the law out of the hands of the nations, and out of the hands of the kings: and they yielded not the horn to the sinner.
<br>49	Now the days drew near that Mathathias should die, and he said to his sons: Now hath pride and chastisement gotten strength, and the time of destruction, and the wrath of indigna- tion:
<br>50	Now, therefore, O my sons, be ye zealous for the law, and give your lives for the covenant of your fathers.
<br>51	And call to remembrance the works of the fathers, which they have done in their genera- tions: and you shall receive great glory, and an everlasting name.
<br>52	Was not Abraham found faithful in temp- tation, and it was reputed to him unto justice?
<br>53	Joseph, in the time of his distress, kept the commandment, and he was made lord of Egypt. 54 Phinees, our father, by being fervent in the zeal of God, received the covenant of an everlast-
<br>ing priesthood.
<br>55	Jesus, whilst he fulfilled the word, was made ruler in Israel.
<br>56	Caleb, for bearing witness before the con- gregation, received an inheritance.
<br>57	David, by his mercy, obtained the throne of an everlasting kingdom.
<br>58	Elias, while he is full of zeal for the law, was taken up into heaven.
<br>59	Ananias and Azarias and Misael, by believ- ing, were delivered out of the flame.
<br>60	Daniel, in his innocency, was delivered out of the mouth of the lions.
<br>61	And thus consider, through all generations: that none that trust in him, fail in strength.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>62	And fear not the words of a sinful man, for his glory is dung and worms:
<br>63	Today he is lifted up, and tomorrow he shall not be found, because he is returned into his earth and his thought is come to nothing.
<br>64	You, therefore, my sons, take courage, and behave manfully in the law: for by it you shall be glorious.
<br>65	And behold, I know that your brother Si- mon is a man of counsel: give ear to him always, and he shall be a father to you.
<br>66	And Judas Machabeus, who is valiant and strong from his youth up, let him be the leader of your army, and he shall manage the war of the people.
<br>67	And you shall take to you all that observe the law: and revenge ye the wrong of your peo- ple.
<br>68	Render to the Gentiles their reward, and take heed to the precepts of the law.
<br>69	And he blessed them, and was joined to his fathers.
<br>70	And he died in the hundred and forty- sixth year: and he was buried by his sons in the sepulchres of his fathers, in Modin, and all Israel mourned for him with great mourning.
<br>
<br>Chapter 3
<br>Then his son Judas, called Machabeus, rose up in his stead.
<br>2	And all his brethren helped him, and all they that had joined themselves to his father, and they fought with cheerfulness the battle of Israel.
<br>3	And he got his people great honour, and put on a breastplate as a giant, and girt his warlike armour about him in battles, and protected the camp with his sword.
<br> 
<br>4	In his acts he was like a lion, and like a lion’s whelp roaring for his prey.
<br>5	And he pursued the wicked and sought them out, and them that troubled his people he burnt with fire:
<br>6	And his enemies were driven away for fear of him, and all the workers of iniquity were trou- bled: and salvation prospered in his hand.
<br>7	And he grieved many kings, and made Jacob glad with his works, and his memory is blessed for ever.
<br>8	And he went through the cities of Juda, and destroyed the wicked out of them, and turned away wrath from Israel.
<br>9	And he was renowned even to the utmost part of the earth, and he gathered them that were perishing.
<br>10	And Apollonius gathered together the Gen- tiles, and a numerous and great army from Samaria, to make war against Israel.
<br>11	And Judas understood it, and went forth to meet him: and he overthrew him, and killed him: and many fell down slain, and the rest fled away.
<br>12	And he took their spoils, and Judas took the sword of Apollonius, and fought with it all his lifetime.
<br>13	And Seron, captain of the army of Syria, heard that Judas had assembled a company of the faithful, and a congregation with him,
<br>14	And he said I will get me a name, and will be glorified in the kingdom, and will overthrow Judas, and those that are with him, that have despised the edict of the king.
<br>15	And he made himself ready; and the host of the wicked went up with him, strong succours, to be revenged of the children of Israel.
<br>16	And they approached even as far as Bethoron: and Judas went forth to meet him, with a small company.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>17	But when they saw the army coming to meet them, they said to Judas: How shall we, being few, be able to fight against so great a multitude, and so strong, and we are ready to faint with fasting today?
<br>18	And Judas said: It is an easy matter for many to be shut up in the hands of a few: and there is no difference in the sight of the God of heaven to deliver with a great multitude, or with a small company:
<br>19	For the success of war is not in the mul- titude of the army, but strength cometh from heaven.
<br>20	They come against us with an insolent mul- titude, and with pride, to destroy us, and our wives, and our children, and to take our spoils.
<br>21	But we will fight for our lives, and our laws:
<br>22	And the Lord himself will overthrow them before our face, but as for you, fear them not
<br>23	And as soon as he had made an end of speaking, he rushed suddenly upon them: and Seron, and his host were overthrown before him:
<br>24	And he pursued him by the descent of Bethoron, even to the plain, and there fell of them eight hundred men, and the rest fled into the land of the Philistines.
<br>25	And the fear of Judas, and of his brethren, and the dread of them, fell upon all the nations round about them.
<br>26	And his fame came to the king, and all nations told of the battles of Judas.
<br>27	Now when king Antiochus heard these words, he was angry in his mind: and he sent, and gathered the forces of all his kingdom, an exceeding strong army.
<br>28	And he opened his treasury, and gave out pay to the army for a year: and he commanded them, that they should be ready for all things.
<br>29	And he perceived that the money of his treasures failed, and that the tributes of the
<br> 
<br>country were small, because of the dissension, and the evil that he had brought upon the land, that he might take away the laws of old times:
<br>30	And he feared that he should not have as formerly enough for charges and gifts, which he had given before with a liberal hand: for he had abounded more than the kings that had been before him.
<br>31	And he was greatly perplexed in mind, and purposed to go into Persia, and to take tributes of the countries, and to gather much money.
<br>32	And he left Lysias, a nobleman of the blood royal to oversee the affairs of the kingdom from the river Euphrates even to the river of Egypt:
<br>33	And to bring up his son, Antiochus, till he came again.
<br>34	And he delivered to him half the army, and the elephants: and he gave him charge concern- ing all that he would have done, and concerning the inhabitants of Judea, and Jerusalem.
<br>35	And that he should send an army against them to destroy and root out the strength of Israel, and the remnant of Jerusalem, and to take away the memory of them from that place.
<br>36	And that he should settle strangers, to dwell in all their coasts, and divide their land by lot.
<br>37	So the king took the half of the army that remained, and went forth from Antioch, the chief city of his kingdom, in the hundred and forty- seventh year: and he passed over the river Eu- phrates, and went through the higher countries. 38 Then Lysias chose Ptolemee, the son of Do- rymenus, and Nicanor, and Gorgias, mighty men
<br>of the king’s friends.
<br>39	And he sent with them forty thousand men, and seven thousand horsemen: to go into the land of Juda, and to destroy it, according to the king’s orders.
<br>40	So they went forth with all their power, and
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>came, and pitched near Emmaus, in the plain country.
<br>41	And the merchants of the countries heard the fame of them: and they took silver and gold in abundance, and servants: and they came into the camp, to buy the children of Israel for slaves: and there were joined to them the forces of Syria, and of the land of the strangers.
<br>42	And Judas, and his brethren, saw that evils were multiplied, and that the armies approached to their borders: and they knew the orders the king had given to destroy the people, and utterly abolish them.
<br>43	And they said, every man to his neighbour: Let us raise up the low condition of our people, and let us fight for our people, and our sanctuary. 44 And the assembly was gathered, that they might be ready for battle, and that they might
<br>pray, and ask mercy and compassion.
<br>45	Now Jerusalem was not inhabited, but was like a desert: there was none of her children that went in or out: and the sanctuary was trodden down: and the children of strangers were in the castle, there was the habitation of the Gentiles: and joy was taken away from Jacob, and the pipe and harp ceased there.
<br>46	And they assembled together, and came to Maspha, over against Jerusalem: for in Maspha was a place of prayer heretofore in Israel.
<br>47	And they fasted that day, and put on hair- cloth, and put ashes upon their heads: and they rent their garments:
<br>48	And they laid open the books of the law, in which the Gentiles searched for the likeness of their idols:
<br>49	And they brought the priestly ornaments, and the first fruits and tithes, and stirred up the Nazarites that had fulfilled their days:
<br>50	And they cried with a loud voice toward heaven, saying: What shall  we  do  with  these,
<br> 
<br>and whither shall we carry them?
<br>51	For thy holies are trodden down, and are profaned, and thy priests are in mourning, and are brought low.
<br>52	And behold the nations are come together against us, to destroy us: thou knowest what they intend against us.
<br>53	How shall we be able to stand before their face, unless thou, O God, help us?
<br>64 Then they sounded with trumpets, and cried out with a loud voice.
<br>66 And after this, Judas appointed captains over the people, over thousands, and over hun- dreds, and over fifties, and over tens.
<br>66	And he said to them that were building houses, or had betrothed wives, or were plant- ing vineyards, or were fearful, that they should return every man to his house, according to the law.
<br>67	So they removed the camp, and pitched on the south side of Emmaus.
<br>68	And Judas said: Gird yourselves, and be valiant men, and be ready against the morning, that you may fight with these nations that are assembled against us to destroy us and our sanc- tuary.
<br>59	For it is better for us to die in battle, than to see the evils of our nation, and of the holies:
<br>60	Nevertheless, as it shall be the will of God in heaven, so be it done.
<br>
<br>Chapter 4
<br>Then Gorgias took five thousand men, and a thousand of the best horsemen; and they re- moved out of the camp by night.
<br>2 That they might come upon the camp of the Jews and strike them suddenly: and the men that were of the castle were their guides.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>3	And Judas heard of it, and rose up, he and the valiant men, to attack the king’s forces that were in Emmaus.
<br>4	For as yet the army was dispersed from the camp
<br>5	And Gorgias came by night into the camp of Judas, and found no man; and he sought them in the mountains: for he said: These men flee from us.
<br>6	And when it was day, Judas shewed himself in the plain with three thousand men only, who neither had armour nor swords:
<br>7	And they saw the camp of the Gentiles that it was strong, and the men in breastplates, and the horsemen round about them, and these were trained up to war.
<br>8	And Judas said to the men that were with him: Fear ye not their multitude, neither be ye afraid of their assault.
<br>9	Remember in what manner our fathers were saved in the Red Sea, when Pharaoh pursued them with a great army.
<br>10	And now let us cry to heaven, and the Lord will have mercy on us, and will remember the covenant of our fathers, and will destroy this army before our face this day:
<br>11	And all nations shall know that there is one that redeemeth and delivereth Israel.
<br>12	And the strangers lifted up their eyes, and saw them coming against them.
<br>13	And they went out of the camp to bat- tle, and they that were with Judas sounded the trumpet.
<br>14	And they joined battle: and the Gentiles were routed, and fled into the plain.
<br>15	But all the hindmost of them fell by the sword and they pursued them as far as Gezeron, and even to the plains of Idumea, and of Azotus, and of Jamnia: and there fell of them to the number of three thousand men.
<br> 
<br>16	And Judas returned again with his army that followed him.
<br>17	And he said to the people: Be not greedy of the spoils; for there is war before us:
<br>18	And Gorgias and his army are near us in the mountain: but stand ye now against our en- emies, and overthrow them, and you shall take the spoils afterwards with safety.
<br>19	And as Judas was speaking these words, behold part of them appeared, looking forth from the mountain.
<br>20	And Gorgias saw that his men were put to flight, and that they had set fire to the camp: for the smoke that was seen declared what was done.
<br>21	And when they had seen this, they were seized with great fear, seeing at the same time Judas and his army in the plain ready to fight.
<br>22	So they all fled away into the land of the strangers.
<br>23	And Judas returned to take the spoils of the camp, and they got much gold, and silver, and blue silk, and purple of the sea, and great riches.
<br>24	And returning home, they sung a hymn, and blessed God in heaven, because he is good, because his mercy endureth for ever.
<br>25	So Israel had a great deliverance that day. 27 And when he heard these things, he was amazed and discouraged: because things had not succeeded in Israel according to his mind, and as
<br>the king had commanded.
<br>28 So the year following, Lysias gathered to- gether threescore thousand chosen men, and five thousand horsemen, that he might subdue them. 29 And they came into Judea, and pitched their tents in Bethoron, and Judas met them
<br>with ten thousand men.
<br>30	And they saw that the army was strong, and he prayed and said: Blessed art thou, O
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Saviour of Israel, who didst break the violence of the mighty by the hand of thy servant David, and didst deliver up the camp of the strangers into the hands of Jonathan the son of Saul, and of his armour bearer.
<br>31	Shut up this army in the hands of thy peo- ple Israel, and let them be confounded in their host and their horsemen. 32 Strike them with fear, and cause the boldness of their strength to languish, and let them quake at their own de- struction.
<br>33	Cast them down with the sword of them that love thee: and let all that know thy name praise thee with hymns.
<br>34	And they joined battle: and there fell of the army of Lysias five thousand men.
<br>35	And when Lysias saw that his men were put to flight, and how bold the Jews were, and that they were ready either to live, or to die man- fully, he went to Antioch, and chose soldiers, that they might come again into Judea with greater numbers.
<br>36	Then Judas, and his brethren said: Behold our enemies are discomfited: let us go up now to cleanse the holy places, and to repair them.
<br>37	And all the army assembled together, and they went up into Mount Sion.
<br>38	And they saw the sanctuary desolate, and the altar profaned, and the gates burnt, and shrubs growing up in the courts as in a forest, or on the mountains, and the chambers joining to the temple thrown down.
<br>39	And they rent their garments, and made great lamentation, and put ashes on their heads: 40 And they fell down to the ground on their faces, and they sounded with the trumpets  of
<br>alarm, and they cried towards heaven.
<br>41	Then Judas appointed men to fight against them that were in the castle, till they had cleansed the holy places,
<br> 
<br>42	And he chose priests without blemish, whose will was set upon the law of God.
<br>43	And they cleansed the holy places, and took away the stones that had been defiled into an unclean place.
<br>44	And he considered about the altar of holo- causts that had been profaned, what he should do with it.
<br>45	And a good counsel came into their minds, to pull it down: lest it should be a reproach to them, because the Gentiles had defiled it; so they threw it down.
<br>46	And they laid up the stones in the moun- tain of the temple, in a convenient place, till there should come a prophet, and give answer concerning them.
<br>47	Then they took whole stones, according to the law and built a new altar, according to the former:
<br>48	And they built up the holy places, and the things that were within the temple: and they sanctified the temple and the courts.
<br>49	And they made new holy vessels, and brought in the candlestick, and the altar of in- cense, and the table, into the temple.
<br>50	And they put incense upon the altar, and lighted up the lamps that were upon the candle- stick, and they gave light in the temple.
<br>51	And they set the loaves upon the table, and hung up the veils, and finished all the works that they had begun to make.
<br>52	And they arose before the morning on the five and twentieth day of the ninth month, (which is the month of Casleu) in the hundred and forty-eighth year.
<br>53	And they offered sacrifice, according to the law, upon the new altar of holocausts which they had made.
<br>54	According to the time, and according to the day wherein the heathens had defiled it, in
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>the same was it dedicated anew with canticles, and harps, and lutes, and cymbals.
<br>55	And all the people fell upon their faces, and adored, and blessed up to heaven, him that had prospered them.
<br>56	And they kept the dedication of the altar eight days, and they offered holocausts with joy, and sacrifices of salvation, and of praise.
<br>57	And they adorned the front of the tem- ple with crowns of gold, and escutcheons, and they renewed the gates, and the chambers, and hanged doors upon them.
<br>58	And there was exceeding great joy among the people, and the reproach of the Gentiles was turned away.
<br>59	And Judas, and his brethren, and all thc church of Israel decreed, that the day of the ded- ication of the altar should be kept in its season from year to year for eight days, from the five and twentieth day of the month of Casleu, with joy and gladness.
<br>60	They built up also at that time Mount Sion, with high walls, and strong towers round about, lest the Gentiles should at any time come, and tread it down, as they did before.
<br>61	And he placed a garrison there, to keep it, and he fortified it, to secure Bethsura, that the people might have a defence against Idumea.
<br>
<br>Chapter 5
<br>Now it came to pass, when the nations round about heard that the altar and the sanctuary were built up, as before, that they were exceed- ing angry.
<br>2 And they thought to destroy the generation of Jacob that were among them, and they began to kill some of the people, and to persecute them. 3 Then Judas fought against the children of
<br> 
<br>Esau in Idumea, and them that were in Acra- bathane: because they beset the Israelites round about, and he made a great slaughter of them.
<br>4	And he remembered the malice of the chil- dren of Bean: who were a snare and a stumbling- block to the people, by lying in wait for them in the way.
<br>5	And they were shut up by him in towers, and he set upon them, and devoted them to utter destruction, and burnt their towers with fire, and all that were in them.
<br>6	Then he passed over to the children of Am- mon, where he found a mighty power, and much people, and Timotheus was their captain:
<br>7	And he fought many battles with them, and they were discomfited in their sight, and he smote them:
<br>8	And he took the city of Gazer and her towns, and returned into Judea.
<br>9	And the Gentiles that were in Galaad, assembled themselves together against the Is- raelites that were in their quarters, to destroy them: and they fled into the fortress of Dathe- man.
<br>10	And they sent letters to Judas, and his brethren, saying: The heathens that are round about are gathered together against us to destroy us:
<br>11	And they are preparing to come, and to take the fortress into which we are fled: and Tim- otheus is the captain of their host.
<br>12	Now therefore come, and deliver us out of their hands, for many of us are slain.
<br>13	And all our brethren that were in the places of Tubin, are killed: and they have carried away their wives, and their children, captives, and taken their spoils, and they have slain there al- most a thousand men.
<br>14	And while they were yet reading these let- ters, behold there came other messengers out of
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Galilee with their garments rent, who related ac- cording to these words:
<br>15	Saying, that they of Ptolemais, and of Tyre, and of Sidon, were assembled against them, and all Galilee is filled with strangers, in order to consume us.
<br>16	Now when Judas and the people heard these words, a great assembly met together to consider what they should do for their brethren that were in trouble, and were assaulted by them.
<br>17	And Judas said to Simon, his brother: Choose thee men, and go, and deliver thy brethren in Galilee: and I, and my brother Jonathan, will go into the country of Galaad:
<br>18	And he left Joseph, the son of Zacharias, and Azarias, captains of the people, with the remnant of the army in Judea, to keep it:
<br>19	And he commanded them, saying: Take ye the charge of this people; but make no war against the heathens, till we return.
<br>20	Now three thousand men were allotted to Simon, to go into Galilee: and eight thousand to Judas, to go into the land of Galaad.
<br>21	And Simon went into Galilee, and fought many battles with the heathens: and the hea- thens were discomfited before his face, and he pursued them even to the gate of Ptolemais.
<br>22	And there fell of the heathens almost three thousand men, and he took the spoils of them.
<br>23	And he took with him those that were in Galilee and in Arbatis, with their wives, and chil- dren, and all that they had, and he brought them into Judea with great joy.
<br>24	And Judas Machabeus, and Jonathan, his brother, passed over the Jordan, and went three days’ journey through the desert.
<br>25	And the Nabutheans met them, and re- ceived them in a peaceable manner, and told them all that happened to their brethren in the
<br> 
<br>land of Galaad,
<br>26	And that many of them were shut up in Barasa, and in Bosor, and in Alima, and in Cas- phor, and in Mageth, and in Carnaim; all these strong and great cities.
<br>27	Yea, and that they were kept shut up in the rest of the cities of Galaad, and that they had appointed to bring their army on the morrow near to these cities, and to take them, and to destroy them all in one day.
<br>28	Then Judas and his army suddenly turned their march into the desert, to Bosor, and took the city: and he slew every male by the edge of the sword, and took all their spoils, and burnt it with fire.
<br>29	And they removed from thence by night, and went till they came to the fortress.
<br>30	And it came to pass that early in the morn- ing, when they lifted up their eyes, behold there were people without number, carrying ladders and engines to take the fortress, and assault them.
<br>31	And Judas saw that the fight was begun, and the cry of the battle went up to heaven like a trumpet, and a great cry out of the city:
<br>32	And he said to his host: Fight ye today for your brethren.
<br>33	And he came with three companies be- hind them, and they sounded their trumpets, and cried out in prayer.
<br>34	And the host of Timotheus understood that it was Machabeus, and they fled away be- fore his face and they made a great slaughter of them, and there fell of them in that day almost eight thousand men.
<br>35	And Judas turned aside to Maspha, and assaulted, and took it, and he slew every male thereof, and took the spoils thereof, and burnt it with fire.
<br>36	From thence he marched, and took Casbon,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>and Mageth, and Bosor, and the rest of the cities of Galaad.
<br>37	But after this Timotheus gathered another army, and camped over against Raphon, beyond the torrent.
<br>38	And Judas sent men to view the army: and they brought him word, saying: All the nations, that are round about us, are assembled unto him an army exceeding great:
<br>39	And they have hired the Arabians to help them, and they have pitched their tents beyond the torrent, ready to come to fight against thee. And Judas went to meet them.
<br>40	And Timotheus said to the captains of his army: When Judas and his army come near the torrent of water, if he pass over unto us first, we shall not be able to withstand him: for he will certainly prevail over us.
<br>41	But if he be afraid to pass over, and camp on the other side of the river, we will pass over to them, and shall prevail against him.
<br>42	Now when Judas came near the torrent of water, he set the scribes of the people by the torrent, and commanded them, saying: Suffer no man to stay behind: but let all come to the battle.
<br>43	And he passed over to them first, and all the people after him, and all the heathens were discomfited before them, and they threw away their weapons, and fled to the temple that was in Carnaim.
<br>44	And he took that city, and the temple he burnt with fire, with all things that were therein: and Carnaim was subdued, and could not stand against the face of Judas.
<br>45	And Judas gathered together all the Is- raelites that were in the land of Galaad, from the least even to the greatest, and their wives and children, and an army exceeding great, to come into the land of Juda.
