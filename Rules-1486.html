<br>(A) Initial year
<br>(i) Determination
<br>
<br>The director of a designated State unit, as provided in paragraph (2), or the Administrator, as provided in paragraph (3), shall award grants under this section for an initial fiscal year if the Administrator determines that the amount of State funds that were earmarked by a State for a preceding fiscal year to support the general operation of centers for independent living meeting the requirements of this subpart equaled or exceeded the amount of funds allotted to the State under subsection (c) or (d) of section 796f of this title for such year.

<br>(B) Subsequent years
<br>
<br>For each year subsequent to the initial fiscal year described in subparagraph (A), the director of the designated State unit shall continue to have the authority to award such grants under this section if the Administrator determines that the State continues to earmark the amount of State funds described in subparagraph (A)(i). If the State does not continue to earmark such an amount for a fiscal year, the State shall be ineligible to make grants under this section after a final year following such fiscal year, as defined in accordance with regulations established by the Administrator, and for each subsequent fiscal year.
<br>(2) Grants by designated State units
<br>
<br>In order for the designated State unit to be eligible to award the grants described in paragraph (1) and carry out this section for a fiscal year with respect to a State, the designated State agency shall submit an application to the Administrator at such time, and in such manner as the Administrator may require, including information about the amount of State funds described in paragraph (1) for the preceding fiscal year.

<br>(g) Review
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The director of the designated State unit shall periodically review each center receiving funds under this section to determine whether such center is in compliance with the standards and assurances set forth in section 796f–4 of this title. If the director of the designated State unit determines that any center receiving funds under this section is not in compliance with the standards and assurances set forth in section 796f–4 of this title, the director of the designated State unit shall immediately notify such center that it is out of compliance.
<br>(2) Enforcement

<br>
<br>(A) the date of such notification; or
<br>
<br>(B) in the case of a center that requests an appeal under subsection (i), the date of any final decision under subsection (i),
<br>
<br>unless the center submits a plan to achieve compliance within 90 days and such plan is approved by the director, or if appealed, by the Administrator.
<br>(h) Onsite compliance review
<br>
<br>The director of the designated State unit shall annually conduct onsite compliance reviews of at least 15 percent of the centers for independent living that receive funding under this section in the State. Each team that conducts onsite compliance review of centers for independent living shall include at least one person who is not an employee of the designated State agency, who has experience in the operation of centers for independent living, and who is jointly selected by the director of the designated State unit and the chairperson of or other individual designated by the Council acting on behalf of and at the direction of the Council. A copy of this review shall be provided to the Administrator.
<br>(i) Adverse actions
<br>
<br>If the director of the designated State unit proposes to take a significant adverse action against a center for independent living, the center may seek mediation and conciliation to be provided by an individual or individuals who are free of conflicts of interest identified by the chairperson of or other individual designated by the Council. If the issue is not resolved through the mediation and conciliation, the center may appeal the proposed adverse action to the Administrator for a final decision.
