<br>(AA) was not reasonably available when the Administrator promulgated the initial standard of performance or comparable requirement of the Vessel General Permit, as applicable (including the subsequent scarcity or unavailability of materials used to control the relevant discharge); and
<br>
<br>(BB) would have justified the application of a less-stringent standard of performance at the time of promulgation; or
