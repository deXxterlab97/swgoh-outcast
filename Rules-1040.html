<br>
<br>(I) consistent with clause (ii), ensures that, for each subject, the total number of students assessed in such subject using the alternate assessments does not exceed 1 percent of the total number of all students in the State who are assessed in such subject;
<br>
<br>(II) ensures that the parents of such students are clearly informed, as part of the process for developing the individualized education program (as defined in section 614(d)(1)(A) of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1414(d)(1)(A)))—
<br>
<br>(aa) that their child's academic achievement will be measured based on such alternate standards; and
<br>
<br>(bb) how participation in such assessments may delay or otherwise affect the student from completing the requirements for a regular high school diploma;
<br>
<br>(III) promotes, consistent with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.), the involvement and progress of students with the most significant cognitive disabilities in the general education curriculum;

<br>Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to permit the Secretary or a State educational agency to impose on any local educational agency a cap on the percentage of students administered an alternate assessment under this subparagraph, except that a local educational agency exceeding the cap applied to the State under clause (i)(I) shall submit information to the State educational agency justifying the need to exceed such cap.
<br>(III) State support
<br>
<br>A State shall provide appropriate oversight, as determined by the State, of any local educational agency that is required to submit information to the State under subclause (II).
<br>(IV) Waiver authority
<br>
<br>This subparagraph shall be subject to the waiver authority under section 7861 of this title.
<br>(E) State authority
<br>
<br>If a State educational agency provides evidence, which is satisfactory to the Secretary, that neither the State educational agency nor any other State government official, agency, or entity has sufficient authority, under State law, to adopt challenging State academic standards, and academic assessments aligned with such standards, which will be applicable to all students enrolled in the State's public elementary schools and secondary schools, then the State educational agency may meet the requirements of this subsection by—
<br>
<br>(i) adopting academic standards and academic assessments that meet the requirements of this subsection, on a statewide basis, and limiting their applicability to students served under this part; or
<br>
<br>(ii) adopting and implementing policies that ensure that each local educational agency in the State that receives grants under this part will adopt academic content and student academic achievement standards, and academic assessments aligned with such standards, which—
<br>
<br>(I) meet all of the criteria in this subsection and any regulations regarding such standards and assessments that the Secretary may publish; and
<br>
<br>(II) are applicable to all students served by each such local educational agency.
<br>(F) Language assessments
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>Each State plan shall identify the languages other than English that are present to a significant extent in the participating student population of the State and indicate the languages for which annual student academic assessments are not available and are needed.
<br>(ii) Secretarial assistance
<br>
<br>The State shall make every effort to develop such assessments and may request assistance from the Secretary if linguistically accessible academic assessment measures are needed. Upon request, the Secretary shall assist with the identification of appropriate academic assessment measures in the needed languages, but shall not mandate a specific academic assessment or mode of instruction.
<br>(G) Assessments of English language proficiency
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>Each State plan shall demonstrate that local educational agencies in the State will provide for an annual assessment of English proficiency of all English learners in the schools served by the State educational agency.
<br>(ii) Alignment
<br>
<br>The assessments described in clause (i) shall be aligned with the State's English language proficiency standards described in paragraph (1)(F).
<br>(H) Locally-selected assessment
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prohibit a local educational agency from administering a locally-selected assessment in lieu of the State-designed academic assessment under subclause (I)(bb) and subclause (II)(cc) of subparagraph (B)(v), if the local educational agency selects a nationally-recognized high school academic assessment that has been approved for use by the State as described in clause (iii) or (iv) of this subparagraph.
<br>(ii) State technical criteria
<br>
<br>To allow for State approval of nationally-recognized high school academic assessments that are available for local selection under clause (i), a State educational agency shall establish technical criteria to determine if any such assessment meets the requirements of clause (v).
<br>(iii) State approval
<br>
<br>If a State educational agency chooses to make a nationally-recognized high school assessment available for selection by a local educational agency under clause (i), which has not already been approved under this clause, such State educational agency shall—
<br>
<br>(I) conduct a review of the assessment to determine if such assessment meets or exceeds the technical criteria established by the State educational agency under clause (ii);
<br>
<br>(II) submit evidence in accordance with subsection (a)(4) that demonstrates such assessment meets the requirements of clause (v); and
<br>
<br>(III) after fulfilling the requirements of subclauses (I) and (II), approve such assessment for selection and use by any local educational agency that requests to use such assessment under clause (i).
<br>(iv) Local educational agency option
<br>(I) Local educational agency
<br>
<br>If a local educational agency chooses to submit a nationally-recognized high school academic assessment to the State educational agency, subject to the approval process described in subclause (I) and subclause (II) of clause (iii) to determine if such assessment fulfills the requirements of clause (v), the State educational agency may approve the use of such assessment consistent with clause (i).
<br>(II) State educational agency
<br>
<br>Upon such approval, the State educational agency shall approve the use of such assessment in any other local educational agency in the State that subsequently requests to use such assessment without repeating the process described in subclauses (I) and (II) of clause (iii).
<br>(v) Requirements
<br>
<br>To receive approval from the State educational agency under clause (iii), a locally-selected assessment shall—
<br>
<br>(I) be aligned to the State's academic content standards under paragraph (1), address the depth and breadth of such standards, and be equivalent in its content coverage, difficulty, and quality to the State-designed assessments under this paragraph (and may be more rigorous in its content coverage and difficulty than such State-designed assessments);
<br>
<br>(II) provide comparable, valid, and reliable data on academic achievement, as compared to the State-designed assessments, for all students and for each subgroup of students defined in subsection (c)(2), with results expressed in terms consistent with the State's academic achievement standards under paragraph (1), among all local educational agencies within the State;
<br>
<br>(III) meet the requirements for the assessments under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, including technical criteria, except the requirement under clause (i) of such subparagraph; and
<br>
<br>(IV) provide unbiased, rational, and consistent differentiation between schools within the State to meet the requirements of subsection (c).

<br>
<br>A local educational agency shall notify the parents of high school students served by the local educational agency—
<br>
<br>(I) of its request to the State educational agency for approval to administer a locally-selected assessment; and
<br>
<br>(II) upon approval, and at the beginning of each subsequent school year during which the locally selected assessment will be administered, that the local educational agency will be administering a different assessment than the State-designed assessments under subclause (I)(bb) and subclause (II)(cc) of subparagraph (B)(v).
<br>(I) Deferral
<br>
<br>A State may defer the commencement, or suspend the administration, but not cease the development, of the assessments described in this paragraph, for 1 year for each year for which the amount appropriated for grants under part B is less than $369,100,000.
<br>(J) Adaptive assessments
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>Subject to clause (ii), a State retains the right to develop and administer computer adaptive assessments as the assessments described in this paragraph, provided the computer adaptive assessments meet the requirements of this paragraph, except that—
<br>
<br>(I) subparagraph (B)(i) shall not be interpreted to require that all students taking the computer adaptive assessment be administered the same assessment items; and
<br>
<br>(II) such assessment—
<br>
<br>(aa) shall measure, at a minimum, each student's academic proficiency based on the challenging State academic standards for the student's grade level and growth toward such standards; and
<br>
<br>(bb) may measure the student's level of academic proficiency and growth using items above or below the student's grade level, including for use as part of a State's accountability system under subsection (c).
<br>(ii) Students with the most significant cognitive disabilities and English learners
<br>
<br>In developing and administering computer adaptive assessments—
<br>
<br>(I) as the assessments allowed under subparagraph (D), a State shall ensure that such computer adaptive assessments—
<br>
<br>(aa) meet the requirements of this paragraph, including subparagraph (D), except such assessments shall not be required to meet the requirements of clause (i)(II); and
<br>
<br>(bb) assess the student's academic achievement to measure, in the subject being assessed, whether the student is performing at the student's grade level; and
<br>
<br>(II) as the assessments required under subparagraph (G), a State shall ensure that such computer adaptive assessments—
<br>
<br>(aa) meet the requirements of this paragraph, including subparagraph (G), except such assessment shall not be required to meet the requirements of clause (i)(II); and
<br>
<br>(bb) assess the student's language proficiency, which may include growth towards such proficiency, in order to measure the student's acquisition of English.
<br>(K) Rule of construction on parent rights
<br>
<br>Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as preempting a State or local law regarding the decision of a parent to not have the parent's child participate in the academic assessments under this paragraph.
<br>(L) Limitation on assessment time
<br>
<br>Subject to Federal or State requirements related to assessments, evaluations, and accommodations, each State may, at the sole discretion of such State, set a target limit on the aggregate amount of time devoted to the administration of assessments for each grade, expressed as a percentage of annual instructional hours.
<br>(3) Exception for recently arrived English learners
<br>(A) Assessments
<br>
<br>With respect to recently arrived English learners who have been enrolled in a school in one of the 50 States in the United States or the District of Columbia for less than 12 months, a State may choose to—
<br>
<br>(i) exclude—
<br>
<br>(I) such an English learner from one administration of the reading or language arts assessment required under paragraph (2); and
<br>
<br>(II) such an English learner's results on any of the assessments required under paragraph (2)(B)(v)(I) or (2)(G) for the first year of the English learner's enrollment in such a school for the purposes of the State-determined accountability system under subsection (c); or
<br>
<br>(ii)(I) assess, and report the performance of, such an English learner on the reading or language arts and mathematics assessments required under paragraph (2)(B)(v)(I) in each year of the student's enrollment in such a school; and
<br>
<br>(II) for the purposes of the State-determined accountability system—
<br>
<br>(aa) for the first year of the student's enrollment in such a school, exclude the results on the assessments described in subclause (I);
<br>
<br>(bb) include a measure of student growth on the assessments described in subclause (I) in the second year of the student's enrollment in such a school; and
<br>
<br>(cc) include proficiency on the assessments described in subclause (I) in the third year of the student's enrollment in such a school, and each succeeding year of such enrollment.
<br>(B) English learner subgroup
<br>
<br>With respect to a student previously identified as an English learner and for not more than 4 years after the student ceases to be identified as an English learner, a State may include the results of the student's assessments under paragraph (2)(B)(v)(I) within the English learner subgroup of the subgroups of students (as defined in subsection (c)(2)(D)) for the purposes of the State-determined accountability system.
<br>(c) Statewide accountability system
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Each State plan shall describe a statewide accountability system that complies with the requirements of this subsection and subsection (d).

<br>
<br>Each State shall describe—
<br>
<br>(A) with respect to any provisions under this part that require disaggregation of information by each subgroup of students—
<br>
<br>(i) the minimum number of students that the State determines are necessary to be included to carry out such requirements and how that number is statistically sound, which shall be the same State-determined number for all students and for each subgroup of students in the State;
<br>
<br>(ii) how such minimum number of students was determined by the State, including how the State collaborated with teachers, principals, other school leaders, parents, and other stakeholders when determining such minimum number; and
<br>
<br>(iii) how the State ensures that such minimum number is sufficient to not reveal any personally identifiable information.
<br>(4) Description of system
<br>
<br>The statewide accountability system described in paragraph (1) shall be based on the challenging State academic standards for reading or language arts and mathematics described in subsection (b)(1) to improve student academic achievement and school success. In designing such system to meet the requirements of this part, the State shall carry out the following:
<br>(A) Establishment of long-term goals
<br>
<br>Establish ambitious State-designed long-term goals, which shall include measurements of interim progress toward meeting such goals—
<br>
<br>(i) for all students and separately for each subgroup of students in the State—
<br>
<br>(I) for, at a minimum, improved—
<br>
<br>(aa) academic achievement, as measured by proficiency on the annual assessments required under subsection (b)(2)(B)(v)(I); and
<br>
<br>(bb) high school graduation rates, including—
<br>
<br>(AA) the four-year adjusted cohort graduation rate; and
<br>
<br>(BB) at the State's discretion, the extended-year adjusted cohort graduation rate, except that the State shall set a more rigorous long-term goal for such graduation rate, as compared to the long-term goal set for the four-year adjusted cohort graduation rate;
<br>
<br>(II) for which the term set by the State for such goals is the same multi-year length of time for all students and for each subgroup of students in the State; and
<br>
<br>(III) that, for subgroups of students who are behind on the measures described in items (aa) and (bb) of subclause (I), take into account the improvement necessary on such measures to make significant progress in closing statewide proficiency and graduation rate gaps; and
<br>
<br>(ii) for English learners, for increases in the percentage of such students making progress in achieving English language proficiency, as defined by the State and measured by the assessments described in subsection (b)(2)(G), within a State-determined timeline.
<br>(B) Indicators
<br>
<br>Except for the indicator described in clause (iv), annually measure, for all students and separately for each subgroup of students, the following indicators:
<br>
<br>(i) For all public schools in the State, based on the long-term goals established under subparagraph (A), academic achievement—
<br>
<br>(I) as measured by proficiency on the annual assessments required under subsection (b)(2)(B)(v)(I); and
<br>
<br>(II) at the State's discretion, for each public high school in the State, student growth, as measured by such annual assessments.
<br>
<br>(ii) For public elementary schools and secondary schools that are not high schools in the State—
<br>
<br>(I) a measure of student growth, if determined appropriate by the State; or
<br>
<br>(II) another valid and reliable statewide academic indicator that allows for meaningful differentiation in school performance.
<br>
<br>(iii) For public high schools in the State, and based on State-designed long term goals established under subparagraph (A)—
<br>
<br>(I) the four-year adjusted cohort graduation rate; and
<br>
<br>(II) at the State's discretion, the extended-year adjusted cohort graduation rate.
<br>
<br>(iv) For public schools in the State, progress in achieving English language proficiency, as defined by the State and measured by the assessments described in subsection (b)(2)(G), within a State-determined timeline for all English learners—
<br>
<br>(I) in each of the grades 3 through 8; and
<br>
<br>(II) in the grade for which such English learners are otherwise assessed under subsection (b)(2)(B)(v)(I) during the grade 9 through grade 12 period, with such progress being measured against the results of the assessments described in subsection (b)(2)(G) taken in the previous grade.
<br>
<br>(v)(I) For all public schools in the State, not less than one indicator of school quality or student success that—
<br>
<br>(aa) allows for meaningful differentiation in school performance;
<br>
<br>(bb) is valid, reliable, comparable, and statewide (with the same indicator or indicators used for each grade span, as such term is determined by the State); and
<br>
<br>(cc) may include one or more of the measures described in subclause (II).
<br>
<br>(II) For purposes of subclause (I), the State may include measures of—
<br>
<br>(III) 6 student engagement;
<br>
<br>(IV) 6 educator engagement;
<br>
<br>(V) 6 student access to and completion of advanced coursework;
<br>
<br>(VI) 6 postsecondary readiness;
<br>
<br>(VII) 6 school climate and safety; and
<br>
<br>(VIII) 6 any other indicator the State chooses that meets the requirements of this clause.
<br>(C) Annual meaningful differentiation
<br>
<br>Establish a system of meaningfully differentiating, on an annual basis, all public schools in the State, which shall—
<br>
<br>(i) be based on all indicators in the State's accountability system under subparagraph (B), for all students and for each of 7 subgroup of students, consistent with the requirements of such subparagraph;
<br>
<br>(ii) with respect to the indicators described in clauses (i) through (iv) of subparagraph (B) afford—
<br>
<br>(I) substantial weight to each such indicator; and
<br>
<br>(II) in the aggregate, much greater weight than is afforded to the indicator or indicators utilized by the State and described in subparagraph (B)(v), in the aggregate; and
<br>
<br>(iii) include differentiation of any such school in which any subgroup of students is consistently underperforming, as determined by the State, based on all indicators under subparagraph (B) and the system established under this subparagraph.
<br>(D) Identification of schools
<br>
<br>Based on the system of meaningful differentiation described in subparagraph (C), establish a State-determined methodology to identify—
<br>
<br>(i) beginning with school year 2017–2018, and at least once every three school years thereafter, one statewide category of schools for comprehensive support and improvement, as described in subsection (d)(1), which shall include—
<br>
<br>(I) not less than the lowest-performing 5 percent of all schools receiving funds under this part in the State;
<br>
<br>(II) all public high schools in the State failing to graduate one third or more of their students; and
<br>
<br>(III) public schools in the State described under subsection (d)(3)(A)(i)(II); and
<br>
<br>(ii) at the discretion of the State, additional statewide categories of schools.
<br>(E) Annual measurement of achievement
<br>
<br>(i) Annually measure the achievement of not less than 95 percent of all students, and 95 percent of all students in each subgroup of students, who are enrolled in public schools on the assessments described under subsection (b)(2)(v)(I).
<br>
<br>(ii) For the purpose of measuring, calculating, and reporting on the indicator described in subparagraph (B)(i), include in the denominator the greater of—
<br>
<br>(I) 95 percent of all such students, or 95 percent of all such students in the subgroup, as the case may be; or
<br>
<br>(II) the number of students participating in the assessments.
<br>
<br>(iii) Provide a clear and understandable explanation of how the State will factor the requirement of clause (i) of this subparagraph into the statewide accountability system.
<br>(F) Partial attendance
<br>
<br>(i) In the case of a student who has not attended the same school within a local educational agency for at least half of a school year, the performance of such student on the indicators described in clauses (i), (ii), (iv), and (v) of subparagraph (B)—
<br>
<br>(I) may not be used in the system of meaningful differentiation of all public schools as described in subparagraph (C) for such school year; and
<br>
<br>(II) shall be used for the purpose of reporting on the State and local educational agency report cards under subsection (h) for such school year.
<br>
<br>(ii) In the case of a high school student who has not attended the same school within a local educational agency for at least half of a school year and has exited high school without a regular high school diploma and without transferring to another high school that grants a regular high school diploma during such school year, the local educational agency shall, in order to calculate the graduation rate pursuant to subparagraph (B)(iii), assign such student to the high school—
<br>
<br>(I) at which such student was enrolled for the greatest proportion of school days while enrolled in grades 9 through 12; or
<br>
<br>(II) in which the student was most recently enrolled.
<br>(5) Accountability for charter schools
<br>
<br>The accountability provisions under this chapter shall be overseen for charter schools in accordance with State charter school law.
<br>(d) School support and improvement activities
<br>(1) Comprehensive support and improvement
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Each State educational agency receiving funds under this part shall notify each local educational agency in the State of any school served by the local educational agency that is identified for comprehensive support and improvement under subsection (c)(4)(D)(i).
<br>(B) Local educational agency action
<br>
<br>Upon receiving such information from the State, the local educational agency shall, for each school identified by the State and in partnership with stakeholders (including principals and other school leaders, teachers, and parents), locally develop and implement a comprehensive support and improvement plan for the school to improve student outcomes, that—
<br>
<br>(i) is informed by all indicators described in subsection (c)(4)(B), including student performance against State-determined long-term goals;
<br>
<br>(ii) includes evidence-based interventions;
<br>
<br>(iii) is based on a school-level needs assessment;
<br>
<br>(iv) identifies resource inequities, which may include a review of local educational agency and school-level budgeting, to be addressed through implementation of such comprehensive support and improvement plan;
<br>
<br>(v) is approved by the school, local educational agency, and State educational agency; and
<br>
<br>(vi) upon approval and implementation, is monitored and periodically reviewed by the State educational agency.
<br>(C) State educational agency discretion
<br>
<br>With respect to any high school in the State identified under subsection (c)(4)(D)(i)(II), the State educational agency may—
<br>
<br>(i) permit differentiated improvement activities that utilize evidence-based interventions in the case of such a school that predominantly serves students—
<br>
<br>(I) returning to education after having exited secondary school without a regular high school diploma; or
<br>
<br>(II) who, based on their grade or age, are significantly off track to accumulate sufficient academic credits to meet high school graduation requirements, as established by the State; and
<br>
<br>(ii) in the case of such a school that has a total enrollment of less than 100 students, permit the local educational agency to forego implementation of improvement activities required under this paragraph.
<br>(D) Public school choice
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>A local educational agency may provide all students enrolled in a school identified by the State for comprehensive support and improvement under subsection (c)(4)(D)(i) with the option to transfer to another public school served by the local educational agency, unless such an option is prohibited by State law.
<br>(ii) Priority
<br>
<br>In providing students the option to transfer to another public school, the local educational agency shall give priority to the lowest-achieving children from low-income families, as determined by the local educational agency for the purposes of allocating funds to schools under section 6313(a)(3) of this title.
<br>(iii) Treatment
<br>
<br>A student who uses the option to transfer to another public school shall be enrolled in classes and other activities in the public school to which the student transfers in the same manner as all other students at the public school.
<br>(iv) Special rule
<br>
<br>A local educational agency shall permit a student who transfers to another public school under this paragraph to remain in that school until the student has completed the highest grade in that school.
<br>(v) Funding for transportation
<br>
<br>A local educational agency may spend an amount equal to not more than 5 percent of its allocation under subpart 2 of this part to pay for the provision of transportation for students who transfer under this paragraph to the public schools to which the students transfer.
<br>(2) Targeted support and improvement
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Each State educational agency receiving funds under this part shall, using the meaningful differentiation of schools described in subsection (c)(4)(C)—
<br>
<br>(i) notify each local educational agency in the State of any school served by the local educational agency in which any subgroup of students is consistently underperforming, as described in subsection (c)(4)(C)(iii); and
<br>
<br>(ii) ensure such local educational agency provides notification to such school with respect to which subgroup or subgroups of students in such school are consistently underperforming as described in subsection (c)(4)(C)(iii).
<br>(B) Targeted support and improvement plan
<br>
<br>Each school receiving a notification described in this paragraph, in partnership with stakeholders (including principals and other school leaders, teachers and parents), shall develop and implement a school-level targeted support and improvement plan to improve student outcomes based on the indicators in the statewide accountability system established under subsection (c)(4), for each subgroup of students that was the subject of notification that—
<br>
<br>(i) is informed by all indicators described in subsection (c)(4)(B), including student performance against long-term goals;
<br>
<br>(ii) includes evidence-based interventions;
<br>
<br>(iii) is approved by the local educational agency prior to implementation of such plan;
<br>
<br>(iv) is monitored, upon submission and implementation, by the local educational agency; and
<br>
<br>(v) results in additional action following unsuccessful implementation of such plan after a number of years determined by the local educational agency.
<br>(C) Additional targeted support
<br>
<br>A plan described in subparagraph (B) that is developed and implemented in any school receiving a notification under this paragraph from the local educational agency in which any subgroup of students, on its own, would lead to identification under subsection (c)(4)(D)(i)(I) using the State's methodology under subsection (c)(4)(D) shall also identify resource inequities (which may include a review of local educational agency and school level budgeting), to be addressed through implementation of such plan.
<br>(D) Special rule
<br>
<br>The State educational agency, based on the State's differentiation of schools under subsection (c)(4)(C) for school year 2017–2018, shall notify local educational agencies of any schools served by the local educational agency in which any subgroup of students, on its own, would lead to identification under subsection (c)(4)(D)(i)(I) using the State's methodology under subsection (c)(4)(D), after which notification of such schools under this paragraph shall result from differentiation of schools pursuant to subsection (c)(4)(C)(iii).
<br>(3) Continued support for school and local educational agency improvement
<br>
<br>To ensure continued progress to improve student academic achievement and school success in the State, the State educational agency—
<br>
<br>(A) shall—
<br>
<br>(i) establish statewide exit criteria for—
<br>
<br>(I) schools identified by the State for comprehensive support and improvement under subsection (c)(4)(D)(i), which, if not satisfied within a State-determined number of years (not to exceed four years), shall result in more rigorous State-determined action, such as the implementation of interventions (which may include addressing school-level operations); and
<br>
<br>(II) schools described in paragraph (2)(C), which, if not satisfied within a State-determined number of years, shall, in the case of such schools receiving assistance under this part, result in identification of the school by the State for comprehensive support and improvement under subsection (c)(4)(D)(i)(III);
<br>
<br>(ii) periodically review resource allocation to support school improvement in each local educational agency in the State serving—
<br>
<br>(I) a significant number of schools identified for comprehensive support and improvement under subsection (c)(4)(D)(i); and
<br>
<br>(II) a significant number of schools implementing targeted support and improvement plans under paragraph (2); and
<br>
<br>(iii) provide technical assistance to each local educational agency in the State serving a significant number of—
<br>
<br>(I) schools implementing comprehensive support and improvement plans under paragraph (1); or
<br>
<br>(II) schools implementing targeted support and improvement plans under paragraph (2); and
<br>
<br>(B) may—
<br>
<br>(i) take action to initiate additional improvement in any local educational agency with—
<br>
<br>(I) a significant number of schools that are consistently identified by the State for comprehensive support and improvement under subsection (c)(4)(D)(i) and not meeting exit criteria established by the State under subparagraph (A)(i)(I); or
<br>
<br>(II) a significant number of schools implementing targeted support and improvement plans under paragraph (2); and
<br>
<br>(ii) consistent with State law, establish alternative evidence-based State determined strategies that can be used by local educational agencies to assist a school identified for comprehensive support and improvement under subsection (c)(4)(D)(i).
<br>(4) Rule of construction for collective bargaining
<br>
<br>Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to alter or otherwise affect the rights, remedies, and procedures afforded to school or local educational agency employees under Federal, State, or local laws (including applicable regulations or court orders) or under the terms of collective bargaining agreements, memoranda of understanding, or other agreements between such employers and their employees.
<br>(e) Prohibition
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to authorize or permit the Secretary—
<br>
<br>(A) when promulgating any rule or regulation, to promulgate any rule or regulation on the development or implementation of the statewide accountability system established under this section that would—
<br>
<br>(i) add new requirements that are inconsistent with or outside the scope of this part;
<br>
<br>(ii) add new criteria that are inconsistent with or outside the scope of this part; or
<br>
<br>(iii) be in excess of statutory authority granted to the Secretary;
<br>
<br>(B) as a condition of approval of the State plan, or revisions or amendments to, the State plan, or approval of a waiver request submitted under section 7861 of this title, to—
<br>
<br>(i) require a State to add any requirements that are inconsistent with or outside the scope of this part;
<br>
<br>(ii) require a State to add or delete one or more specific elements of the challenging State academic standards; or
<br>
<br>(iii) prescribe—
<br>
<br>(I) numeric long-term goals or measurements of interim progress that States establish for all students, for any subgroups of students, and for English learners with respect to English language proficiency, under this part, including—
<br>
