<br>§56502. Adjusting obligations and arranging maintenance
<br>
<br>(a) General Authority.—On written application, the Secretary of Transportation may adjust obligations and arrange for maintenance of an essential vessel as provided in this chapter if the Secretary determines, after any investigation or proceeding the Secretary considers desirable, that—
<br>
<br>(1) the operation of the vessel in the service, route, or line to which it is assigned under this subtitle, or in which it otherwise would be operated, is not—
<br>
<br>(A) lawful under the Neutrality Act of 1939 (22 U.S.C. 441 et seq.) or a proclamation issued under that Act; or
<br>
<br>(B) compatible with maintaining the availability of the vessel for national defense and commerce;
<br>
<br>(2) it is not feasible under existing law to employ the vessel in any other service or operation in foreign or domestic trade (except temporary or emergency operation under section 56503(b)(5) of this title); and
<br>
<br>(3) the applicant, because of the restrictions of the Neutrality Act of 1939 (22 U.S.C. 441 et seq.) or the withdrawal of vessels for national defense under paragraph (1), is not earning or will not earn a reasonable return on the capital necessarily employed in its business.
<br>
<br>(b) Effective Period.—Adjustments and arrangements under subsection (a) shall continue in effect only as long as the circumstances described in subsection (a) continue to exist.

<br>(3) Postponement or cancellation of interest accruing on the obligations during a lay-up period.
<br>
<br>(4) Extension, for not more than the total period of the lay-up, of the 20-year life limitation for the vessel and other limitations and provisions of this subtitle based on a 20-year life.

<br>
<br>(6) Payment to the Secretary, on termination of the arrangements with the applicant, of the applicant's net profits (earned while the arrangements were in effect) in excess of 10 percent a year on the capital necessarily employed in the applicant's business, as reimbursement for obligations postponed or canceled and expenses incurred or paid by the Secretary under this section.

Vessels in the National Defense Reserve Fleet, including vessels loaned to State maritime academies, shall be considered public vessels of the United States.
<br>
<br>(b) Permitted Uses.—Except as otherwise provided by law, a vessel in the fleet may be used—
<br>
<br>(1) for an account of an agency of the United States Government in a period during which vessels may be requisitioned under section 902 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 (46 App. U.S.C. 1242); 1 or

<br>
<br>(4) for training purposes to the extent authorized by the Secretary of Transportation with the concurrence of the Secretary of Defense;
<br>
<br>(5) on a reimbursable basis, for charter to the government of any State, locality, or Territory of the United States, except that the prior consent of the Secretary of Defense for such use shall be required with respect to any vessel in the Ready Reserve Force or in the National Defense Reserve Fleet which is maintained in a retention status for the Department of Defense; or
<br>
<br>(6) for civil contingency operations and Maritime Administration promotional and media events, in accordance with subsection (f).
<br>
<br>(c) Ready Reserve Force Management.—

<br>(1) Minimum requirements.—To ensure the readiness of vessels in the Ready Reserve Force component of the National Defense Reserve Fleet, the Secretary of Transportation shall, at a minimum—
<br>
<br>(A) maintain all of the vessels in a manner that will enable each vessel to be activated within a period specified in plans for mobilization of the vessels;
<br>
<br>(B) activate and conduct sea trials on each vessel at a frequency that is considered by the Secretary to be necessary;
<br>
<br>(C) maintain and adequately crew, as necessary, in an enhanced readiness status those vessels that are scheduled to be activated in 5 or less days;
<br>
<br>(D) locate those vessels that are scheduled to be activated near embarkation ports specified for those vessels; and
<br>
<br>(E) notwithstanding section 2109 of title 46, United States Code, have each vessel inspected by the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to determine if the vessel meets the safety standards that would apply under part B of subtitle II of that title if the vessel were not a public vessel.
<br>
<br>(2) Vessel managers.—
<br>
<br>(A) Eligibility for contract.—A person, including a shipyard, is eligible for a contract for the management of a vessel in the Ready Reserve Force if the Secretary determines, at a minimum, that the person has—
<br>
<br>(i) experience in the operation of commercial-type vessels or public vessels owned by the United States Government; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the management capability necessary to operate, maintain, and activate the vessel at a reasonable price.
<br>
<br>(B) Contract requirement.—The Secretary of Transportation shall include in each contract for the management of a vessel in the Ready Reserve Force a requirement that each seaman who performs services on any vessel covered by the contract hold the license or merchant mariner's document that would be required under chapter 71 or chapter 73 of title 46, United States Code, for a seaman performing that service while operating the vessel if the vessel were not a public vessel.
<br>
<br>(d) Applicability of Limitations on Overhaul, Repair, and Maintenance in Foreign Shipyards.—
<br>
<br>(1) Application of limitation.—The provisions of section 8680 of title 10 shall apply to vessels specified in subsection (b), and to the Secretary of Transportation with respect to those vessels, in the same manner as those provisions apply to vessels specified in subsection (b) of such section, and to the Secretary of the Navy, respectively.
<br>
<br>(2) Covered vessels.—Vessels specified in this paragraph are vessels maintained by the Secretary of Transportation in support of the Department of Defense, including any vessel assigned by the Secretary of Transportation to the Ready Reserve Force that is owned by the United States.
<br>
<br>(e) Exemption From Tank Vessel Construction Standards.—Vessels in the National Defense Reserve Fleet are exempt from the provisions of section 3703a.
<br>
<br>(f) Use of NDRF Vessels for Civil Contingency Operations and Promotional and Media Events.—With the concurrence of the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Transportation may allow the use of vessels in the National Defense Reserve Fleet (NDRF) for civil contingency operations requested by another Federal agency, and for Maritime Administration promotional and media events relating to demonstration projects and research and development supporting the Administration's mission, if the Secretary of Transportation determines such use is in the best interest of the Government after considering the following factors:
<br>
<br>(1) Availability.—The availability of NDRF or Ready Reserve Force (RRF) resources and the impact of such use on NDRF and RRF mission support to the defense and homeland security requirements of the Government.
<br>
<br>(2) Interference.—Whether the such 2 use of vessels will support the mission of the Maritime Administration and not significantly interfere with NDRF vessel maintenance, repair, safety, readiness, and resource availability.
<br>
<br>(3) Safety.—Whether safety precautions will be taken, including indemnification of liability when applicable.
<br>
<br>(4) Cost.—Whether any costs incurred by such use will be funded as a reimbursable transaction between Federal agencies, as applicable.
<br>
<br>(5) Other matters.—Any other matters the Maritime Administrator considers appropriate.
<br>
<br>(g) Vessel Status.—A vessel in the National Defense Reserve Fleet determined by the Maritime Administration to be of insufficient value to remain in the National Defense Reserve Fleet shall remain a vessel within the meaning of that term in section 3 of title 1, United States Code, and subject to the rights and responsibilities of a vessel under admiralty law at least until such time as the vessel is delivered to a dismantling facility or is disposed of otherwise from the National Defense Reserve Fleet.

<br>
<br>(A) the recipient will, at the discretion of the Secretary, reconvey the vessel to the Government in good condition except for ordinary wear and tear; or
<br>

<br>
<br>In subsection (a), before paragraph (1), the words "Notwithstanding section 1160(j) of this title" are omitted as unnecessary because section 46 App. U.S.C. 1160(j) is restated in section 57101 of the revised title and that section contains an exception which includes this section. In paragraph (1), the words "Commonwealth, or possession of the United States" and "or the District of Columbia" are omitted as unnecessary because of the definition of "State" in chapter 1 of the revised title.

<br>
<br>(c) Costs Incident to Lay-Up.—Costs incident to the lay-up of the vessel acquired under this section may be paid from amounts in the Fund.
<br>

<br>§57105. Acquisition of vessels for essential services, routes, or lines
<br>
<br>(a) In General.—The Secretary of Transportation may acquire a vessel, by purchase or otherwise, if—
<br>
<br>(1) the Secretary considers the vessel necessary to establish, maintain, improve, or serve as a replacement on an essential service, route, or line in the foreign commerce of the United States, as determined under section 50103 of this title;

<br>
<br>(3) Advance payments.—Payments made in advance shall be for any part of the estimated cost as determined by the Secretary of Transportation. Adjustments to the amounts paid in advance shall be made as agreed to by the Secretary of Transportation and the head of the ordering agency or unit based on the actual cost of goods or services provided.

<br>(1) the scrap value of the obsolete vessel in American and foreign markets;
<br>
<br>(2) the depreciated value based on a 20-year or 25-year life, whichever applies to the obsolete vessel; and

<br>(3) the market value of the obsolete vessel for operation in world commerce or in the domestic or foreign commerce of the United States.
<br>
<br>(b) Use of Obsolete Vessels.—If acquisition of the obsolete vessel occurs when the owner contracts for the construction of the new vessel, and the owner uses the obsolete vessel during the period of construction of the new vessel, the Secretary shall reduce the trade-in allowance by an amount representing the fair value of that use. The Secretary shall establish the rate for use of the obsolete vessel when the contract for construction of the new vessel is made.

If the new vessel is constructed under this subtitle, the Secretary may apply the trade-in allowance to the required cash payments on terms and conditions the Secretary may prescribe. If the new vessel is not constructed under this subtitle, the Secretary shall pay the trade-in allowance to the builder of the vessel for the account of the owner when the Secretary acquires the obsolete vessel.

The basis of the new vessel acquired with the allowance is the same as the basis of the obsolete vessel—
<br>

However, any cumulative net voyage profit accounted for under this subsection is not to be included in the calculation of cumulative net voyage profit in any subsequent year.
