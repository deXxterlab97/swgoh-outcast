<br>One would think the deep to be hoary.
<br>25Upon earth there is not his like Who is made to be fearless.
<br>26He looketh at all high things;
<br>He is king over all the proud beasts.
<br>
<br>Then Job answered the LORD, and said:
<br>2I know that Thou canst do every thing,
<br>And that no purpose can be withholden from Thee.
<br>3Who is this that hideth counsel without knowledge?
<br>Therefore have I uttered that which I understood not,
<br>Things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.
<br>4Hear, I beseech Thee, and I will speak;
<br>I will demand of Thee, and declare Thou unto me.
<br>5I had heard of Thee by the hearing of the ear;
<br>But now mine eye seeth Thee;
<br>6Wherefore I abhor my words, and repent,
<br> 
<br>Seeing I am dust and ashes.
<br>
<br>7And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite: ‘My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends; for ye have not spoken of Me the thing that is right, as My servant Job hath. 8Now therefore, take unto you seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to My servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt- offering; and My servant Job shall pray for you; for him will I accept, that I do not unto you aught unseemly; for ye have not spoken of Me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.’ 9So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them; and the LORD accepted Job. 10And the LORD changed the fortune of Job, when he prayed for his friends; and the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before. 11Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house; and they bemoaned him, and comforted him concerning all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him; every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one a ring of gold. 12So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning; and he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she-asses.
<br> 
<br>13He had also seven sons and three daughters. 14And he called the name of the first, aJemimah; and the name of the second, bKeziah; and the name of the third, cKeren-happuch. 15And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job; and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren. 16And after this Job lived a hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons’sons, even four generations. 17So Job died, being old and full of days.

<br>SONG OF SONGS
<br> 
<br>THE  song of songs, which is Solomon’s.
<br>
<br>2Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth—
<br>For thy love is better than wine.
<br>3Thine ointments have a goodly fragrance;
<br>Thy name is as ointment poured forth;
<br>Therefore do the maidens love thee.
<br>4Draw me, we will run after thee;
<br>The king hath brought me into his chambers;
<br>We will be glad and rejoice in thee,
<br>We will find thy love more fragrant than wine!
<br>Sincerely do they love thee.
<br>5’I am black, but comely,
<br>O ye daughters of Jerusalem, As the tents of Kedar,
<br>As the curtains of Solomon.
<br>6Look not upon me, that I am swarthy,
<br>That the sun hath tanned me;
<br>My mother’s sons were incensed against me,
<br>They made me keeper of the vineyards;
<br>But mine own vineyard have I not kept.’
<br>7Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth,
<br> 
<br>Where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon;
<br>For why should I be as one that veileth herself
<br>Beside the flocks of thy companions?
<br>8If thou know not, O thou fairest among women,
<br>Go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock
<br>And feed thy kids, beside the shepherds’tents.
<br>9I have compared thee, O my love, To a steed in Pharaoh’s chariots. 10Thy cheeks are comely with
<br>circlets,
<br>Thy neck with beads.
<br>11We will make thee circlets of gold With studs of silver.
<br>
<br>12While the king sat at his table,
<br>My spikenard sent forth its fragrance.
<br>13My beloved is unto me as a bag of myrrh,
<br>That lieth betwixt my breasts.
<br>14My beloved is unto me as a cluster of henna
<br>In the vineyards of En-gedi.
<br>
<br>15Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair;
<br>Thine eyes are as doves.
<br> 
<br>16Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant;
<br>Also our couch is leafy.
<br>17The beams of our houses are cedars,
<br>And our panels are cypresses.
<br>
<br>I am a rose of Sharon, A lily of the valleys.
<br>
<br>2As a lily among thorns,
<br>So is my love among the daughters.
<br>3As an apple-tree among the trees of the wood,
<br>So is my beloved among the sons. Under its shadow I delighted to sit, And its fruit was sweet to my taste. 4He hath brought me to the
<br>banqueting-house,
<br>And his banner over me is love.
<br>5’Stay ye me with dainties, refresh me with apples;
<br>For I am love-sick.’
<br>6Let his left hand be under my head, And his right hand embrace me.
<br>7’I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem,
<br>By the gazelles, and by the hinds of the field,
<br>That ye awaken not, nor stir up love, until it please.’
<br>8Hark! my beloved! behold, he cometh,
<br>Leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.
<br>9My beloved is like a gazelle or a young hart;
<br>Behold, he standeth behind our wall, He looketh in through the windows,
<br> 
<br>He peereth through the lattice.
<br>10My beloved spoke, and said unto me:
<br>‘Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.
<br>11For, lo, the winter is past, The rain is over and gone;
<br>12The flowers appear on the earth; The time of singing is come,
<br>And the voice of the turtle is heard in our land;
<br>13The fig-tree putteth forth her green figs,
<br>And the vines in blossom give forth their fragrance.
<br>Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.
<br>14O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the covert of the cliff,
<br>Let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice;
<br>For sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.’
<br>15’Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vineyards;
<br>For our vineyards are in blossom.’ 16My beloved is mine, and I am his, That feedeth among the lilies.
<br>17Until the day breathe, and the shadows flee away,
<br>Turn, my beloved, and be thou like a gazelle or a young hart
<br>Upon the mountains of spices.
<br>
<br>By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth;
<br>I sought him, but I found him not.
<br>2’I will rise now, and go about the city,
<br> 
<br>In the streets and in the broad ways,
<br>I will seek him whom my soul loveth.’
<br>I sought him, but I found him not.
<br>3The watchmen that go about the city found me:
<br>‘Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?’
<br>4Scarce had I passed from them,
<br>When I found him whom my soul loveth:
<br>I held him, and would not let him go,
<br>Until I had brought him into my mother’s house,
<br>And into the chamber of her that conceived me.
<br>5’I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem,
<br>By the gazelles, and by the hinds of the field,
<br>That ye awaken not, nor stir up love, Until it please.’
<br>
<br>6Who is this that cometh up out of the wilderness
<br>Like pillars of smoke,
<br>Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense,
<br>With all powders of the merchant? 7Behold, it is the litter of Solomon; Threescore mighty men are about it, Of the mighty men of Israel.
<br>8They all handle the sword, And are expert in war;
<br>Every man hath his sword upon his thigh,
<br>Because of dread in the night.
<br> 
<br>9King Solomon made himself a palanquin
<br>Of the wood of Lebanon.
<br>10He made the pillars thereof of silver,
<br>The top thereof of gold, The seat of it of purple,
<br>The inside thereof being inlaid with love,
<br>From the daughters of Jerusalem. 11Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, And gaze upon king Solomon,
<br>Even upon the crown wherewith his mother hath crowned him in the day of his espousals,
<br>And in the day of the gladness of his heart.
<br>
<br>Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair;
<br>Thine eyes are as doves behind thy veil;
<br>Thy hair is as a flock of goats, that trail down from mount Gilead.
<br>2Thy teeth are like a flock of ewes all shaped alike,
<br>Which are come up from the washing;
<br>Whereof all are paired, and none faileth among them.
<br>3Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, And thy mouth is comely;
<br>Thy temples are like a pomegranate split open
<br>Behind thy veil.
<br>4Thy neck is like the tower of David Builded with turrets,
<br>Whereon there hang a thousand shields,
<br> 
<br>All the armour of the mighty men. 5Thy two breasts are like two fawns That are twins of a gazelle,
<br>Which feed among the lilies.
<br>6Until the day breathe,
<br>And the shadows flee away,
<br>I will get me to the mountain of myrrh,
<br>And to the hill of frankincense. 7Thou art all fair, my love; And there is no spot in thee.
<br>8Come with me from Lebanon, my bride,
<br>With me from Lebanon; Look from the top of Amana,
<br>From the top of Senir and Hermon, From the lions’dens,
<br>From the mountains of the leopards.
<br>9Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my bride;
<br>Thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes,
<br>With one bead of thy necklace.
<br>10How fair is thy love, my sister, my bride!
<br>How much better is thy love than wine!
<br>And the smell of thine ointments than all manner of spices!
<br>11Thy lips, O my bride, drop honey—
<br>Honey and milk are under thy tongue;
<br>And the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon.
<br>12A garden shut up is my sister, my bride;
<br>A spring shut up, a fountain sealed.
<br> 
<br>13Thy shoots are a park of pomegranates,
<br>With precious fruits;
<br>Henna with spikenard plants,
<br>14Spikenard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon,
<br>With all trees of frankincense;
<br>Myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices.
<br>15Thou art a fountain of gardens, A well of living waters,
<br>And flowing streams from Lebanon.
<br>
<br>16Awake, O north wind; And come, thou south; Blow upon my garden,
<br>That the spices thereof may flow out.
<br>Let my beloved come into his garden,
<br>And eat his precious fruits.
<br>
<br>I am come into my garden, my sister, my bride;
<br>I have gathered my myrrh with my spice;
<br>I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey;
<br>I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, O friends;
<br>Drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.
<br>
<br>2I sleep, but my heart waketh; Hark! my beloved knocketh:
<br>‘Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled;
<br>For my head is filled with dew,
<br> 
<br>My locks with the drops of the night.’
<br>3I have put off my coat; How shall I put it on?
<br>I have washed my feet; How shall I defile them?
<br>4My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door,
<br>And my heart was moved for him. 5I rose up to open to my beloved; And my hands dropped with myrrh, And my fingers with flowing myrrh, Upon the handles of the bar.
<br>6I opened to my beloved;
<br>But my beloved had turned away, and was gone.
<br>My soul failed me when he spoke.
<br>I sought him, but I could not find him;
<br>I called him, but he gave me no answer.
<br>7The watchmen that go about the city found me,
<br>They smote me, they wounded me;
<br>The keepers of the walls took away my mantle from me.
<br>8’I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem,
<br>If ye find my beloved, what will ye tell him?
<br>That I am love-sick.’
<br>9’What is thy beloved more than another beloved,
<br>O thou fairest among women?
<br>What is thy beloved more than another beloved,
<br>That thou dost so adjure us?’ 10’My beloved is white and ruddy, Pre-eminent above ten thousand.
<br> 
<br>11His head is as the most fine gold, His locks are curled,
<br>And black as a raven. 12His eyes are like doves Beside the water-brooks; Washed with milk,
<br>And fitly set.
<br>13His cheeks are as a bed of spices, As banks of sweet herbs;
<br>His lips are as lilies, Dropping with flowing myrrh.
<br>14His hands are as rods of gold Set with beryl;
<br>His body is as polished ivory Overlaid with sapphires.
<br>15His legs are as pillars of marble, Set upon sockets of fine gold; His aspect is like Lebanon, Excellent as the cedars.
<br>16His mouth is most sweet; Yea, he is altogether lovely.
<br>This is my beloved, and this is my friend,
<br>O daughters of Jerusalem.’
<br>
<br>’Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women?
<br>Whither hath thy beloved turned him,
<br>That we may seek him with thee?’
<br>2’My beloved is gone down into his garden,
<br>To the beds of spices, To feed in the gardens, And to gather lilies.
<br>3I am my beloved’s, and my beloved is mine,
<br>That feedeth among the lilies.’
<br> 
<br>4Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah,
<br>Comely as Jerusalem,
<br>Terrible as an army with banners. 5Turn away thine eyes from me, For they have overcome me.
<br>Thy hair is as a flock of goats, That trail down from Gilead.
<br>6Thy teeth are like a flock of ewes,
<br>Which are come up from the washing;
<br>Whereof all are paired,
<br>And none faileth among them.
<br>7Thy temples are like a pomegranate split open
<br>Behind thy veil.
<br>8There are threescore queens, And fourscore concubines, And maidens without number.
<br>9My dove, my undefiled, is but one; She is the only one of her mother;
<br>She is the choice one of her that bore her.
<br>The daughters saw her, and called her happy;
<br>Yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.
<br>10Who is she that looketh forth as the dawn,
<br>Fair as the moon, Clear as the sun,
<br>Terrible as an army with banners?
<br>11I went down into the garden of nuts,
<br>To look at the green plants of the valley,
<br>To see whether the vine budded,
<br>And the pomegranates were in flower.
<br> 
<br>12Before I was aware, my soul set me
<br>Upon the chariots of my princely people.
<br>
<br>Return, return, O Shulammite;
<br>Return, return, that we may look upon thee.
<br>
<br>What will ye see in the Shulammite?
<br>As it were a dance of two companies.
<br>
<br>2How beautiful are thy steps in sandals,
<br>O prince’s daughter!
<br>The roundings of thy thighs are like the links of a chain,
<br>The work of the hands of a skilled workman.
<br>3Thy navel is like a round goblet,
<br>Wherein no mingled wine is wanting;
<br>Thy belly is like a heap of wheat Set about with lilies.
<br>4Thy two breasts are like two fawns That are twins of a gazelle.
<br>5Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; Thine eyes as the pools in Heshbon, By the gate of Bath-rabbim;
<br>Thy nose is like the tower of Lebanon
<br>Which looketh toward Damascus. 6Thy head upon thee is like Carmel, And the hair of thy head like purple;
<br>The king is held captive in the tresses thereof.
<br>7How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!
<br> 
<br>8This thy stature is like to a palm- tree,
<br>And thy breasts to clusters of grapes.
<br>9I said: ‘I will climb up into the palm-tree,
<br>I will take hold of the branches thereof;
<br>And let thy breasts be as clusters of the vine,
<br>And the smell of thy countenance like apples;
<br>10And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine,
<br>That glideth down smoothly for my beloved,
<br>Moving gently the lips of those that are asleep.’
<br>
<br>11I am my beloved’s,
<br>And his desire is toward me. : 12Come, my beloved, let us go forth
<br>into the field;
<br>Let us lodge in the villages.
<br>13Let us get up early to the vineyards;
<br>Let us see whether the vine hath budded,
<br>Whether the vine-blossom be opened,
<br>And the pomegranates be in flower; There will I give thee my love.
<br>14The mandrakes give forth fragrance,
<br>And at our doors are all manner of precious fruits,
<br>New and old,
<br>Which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.
<br> 
<br>
<br>Oh that thou wert as my brother,
<br>That sucked the breasts of my mother!
<br>When I should find thee without, I would kiss thee;
<br>Yea, and none would despise me.
<br>2I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mother’s house,
<br>That thou mightest instruct me;
<br>I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine,
<br>Of the juice of my pomegranate.
<br>3His left hand should be under my head,
<br>And his right hand should embrace me.
<br>4’I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem:
<br>Why should ye awaken, or stir up love,
<br>Until it please?’
<br>
<br>5Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness,
<br>Leaning upon her beloved?
<br>Under the apple-tree I awakened thee;
<br>There thy mother was in travail with thee;
<br>There was she in travail and brought thee forth.
<br>
<br>6Set me as a seal upon thy heart, As a seal upon thine arm;
<br>For love is strong as death, Jealousy is cruel as the grave;
<br>The flashes thereof are flashes of fire,
<br> 
<br>A very flame of the LORD.
<br>7Many waters cannot quench love, Neither can the floods drown it;
<br>If a man would give all the substance of his house for love,
<br>He would utterly be contemned.
<br>8We have a little sister, And she hath no breasts;
<br>What shall we do for our sister
<br>In the day when she shall be spoken for?
<br>9If she be a wall,
<br>We will build upon her a turret of silver;
<br>And if she be a door,
<br>We will enclose her with boards of cedar.
<br>
<br>10I am a wall,
<br>And my breasts like the towers thereof;
<br>Then was I in his eyes As one that found peace.
<br> 
<br>11Solomon had a vineyard at Baal- hamon;
<br>He gave over the vineyard unto keepers;
<br>Every one for the fruit thereof Brought in a thousand pieces of
<br>silver.
<br>12My vineyard, which is mine, is before me;
<br>Thou, O Solomon, shalt have the thousand,
<br>And those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.
<br>
<br>13Thou that dwellest in the gardens,
<br>The companions hearken for thy voice:
<br>‘Cause me to hear it.’
<br>
<br>14Make haste, my beloved,
<br>And be thou like to a gazelle or to a young hart
<br>Upon the mountains of spices.
<br> 
<br>רות
<br>RUTH
<br> 
<br>AND IT came to pass in the days when the judges judged, that there
<br>was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Beth-lehem in Judah went to sojourn in the field of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons. 2And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Beth-lehem in Judah. And they came into the field of Moab, and continued there. 3And Elimelech Naomi’s husband died; and she was left, and her two sons. 4And they took them wives of the women of Moab: the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth; and they dwelt there about ten years. 5And Mahlon and Chilion died both of them; and the woman was left of her two children and of her husband. 6Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return from the field of Moab; for she had heard in the field of Moab how that the LORD had remembered His people in giving them bread. 7And she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah. 8And Naomi said unto her two daughters-in-law: ‘Go, return each of you to her mother’s house; the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me. 9The
<br> 
<br>LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband.’ Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept. 10And they said unto her: ‘Nay, but we will return with thee unto thy people.’ 11And Naomi said: ‘Turn back, my daughters; why will ye go with me? have I yet sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands? 12Turn back, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say: I have hope, should I even have an husband to-night, and also bear sons; 13would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye shut yourselves off for them and have no husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes, for the hand of the LORD is gone forth against me.’ 14And they lifted up their voice, and wept again; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law; but Ruth cleaved unto her. 15And she said: ‘Behold, thy sister-in-law is gone back unto her people, and unto her god; return thou after thy sister-in-law.’ 16And Ruth said: ‘Entreat me not to leave thee, and to return from following after thee; for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge; thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God; 17where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried; the LORD do so to me,
<br> 
<br>and more also, if aught but death part thee and me.’ 18And when she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, she left off speaking unto her. 19So they two went until they came to Beth- lehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Beth-lehem, that all the city was astir concerning them, and the women said: ‘Is this Naomi?’ 20And she said unto them: ‘Call me not aNaomi, call me bMarah; for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me. 21I went out full, and the LORD hath brought me back home empty; why call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?’ 22So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her, who returned out of the field of Moab—and they came to Beth-lehem in the beginning of barley harvest.
<br>And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband’s,   a   mighty   man   of valour, of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz. 2And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi: ‘Let me now go to the field, and glean among the ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find favour.’ And she said unto her: ‘Go, my daughter.’ 3And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers; and her hap was to light on the portion of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech. 4And, behold,
<br>
<br>a That is, Pleasant.
<br>b That is, Bitter.
<br> 
<br>Boaz came from Beth-lehem, and said unto the reapers: ‘The LORD be with you.’ And they answered him: ‘The LORD bless thee.’ 5Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers: ‘Whose damsel is this?’ 6And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said: ‘It is a Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the field of Moab; 7and she said: Let me glean, I pray you, and gather after the reapers among the sheaves; so she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, save that she tarried a little in the house.’ 8Then said Boaz unto Ruth: ‘Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither pass from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens. 9Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them; have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.’ 10Then she fell on her face, and bowed down to the ground, and said unto him: ‘Why have I found favour in thy sight, that thou shouldest take cognizance of me, seeing I am a foreigner?’ 11And Boaz answered and said unto her: ‘It hath fully been told me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thy husband; and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people that thou knewest not
<br> 
<br>heretofore. 12The LORD recompense thy work, and be thy reward complete from the LORD, the God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to take refuge.’ 13Then she said: ‘Let me find favour in thy sight, my LORD; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken to the heart of thy handmaid, though I be not as one of thy handmaidens.’ 14And Boaz said unto her at meal-time: ‘Come hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar.’ And she sat beside the reapers; and they reached her parched corn, and she did eat and was satisfied, and left thereof. 15And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying: ‘Let her glean even among the sheaves, and put her not to shame. 16And also pull out some for her of purpose from the bundles, and leave it, and let her glean, and rebuke her not.’ 17So she gleaned in the field until even; and she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley. 18And she took it up, and went into the city; and her mother-in- law saw what she had gleaned; and she brought forth and gave to her that which she had left after she was satisfied. 19And her mother-in-law said unto her: ‘Where hast thou gleaned to- day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee.’ And she told her mother-in- law with whom she had wrought, and said: ‘The man’s name with whom I wrought to-day is Boaz.’ 20And Naomi

<br>said unto her daughter-in-law: ‘Blessed be he of the LORD, who hath not left off His kindness to the living and to the dead.’ And Naomi said unto her: ‘The man is nigh of kin unto us, one of our near kinsmen.’ 21And Ruth the Moabitess said: ‘Yea, he said unto me: Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.’ 22And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter-in-law: ‘It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, and that thou be not met in any other field.’ 23So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and she dwelt with her mother-in-law.
<br>And Naomi her mother-in-law said unto her: ‘My daughter, shall
<br>I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee? 2And now is there not Boaz our kinsman, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to-night in the threshing-floor. 3Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the threshing-floor; but make not thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking. 4And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do.’ 5And she said unto her: ‘All that thou sayest unto me I will do.’ 6And she went down unto the threshing-
<br> 
<br>floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law bade her. 7And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn; and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down. 8And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was startled, and turned himself; and, behold, a woman lay at his feet. 9And he said: ‘Who art thou?’ And she answered: ‘I am Ruth thine handmaid; spread therefore thy skirt over thy handmaid; for thou art a near kinsman.’ 10And he said: ‘Blessed be thou of the LORD, my daughter; thou hast shown more kindness in the end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou didst not follow the young men, whether poor or rich. 11And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou sayest; for all the men in the gate of my people do know that thou art a virtuous woman. 12And now it is true that I am a near kinsman; howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I. 13Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman’s part; but if he be not willing to do the part of a kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, as the LORD liveth; lie down until the morning.’ 14And she lay at his feet until the morning; and she rose up before one could discern another. For he said: ‘Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing-floor.’ 15And he said: ‘Bring
<br> 
<br>the mantle that is upon thee, and hold it’; and she held it; and he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her; and he went into the city. 16And when she came to her mother-in-law, she said: ‘Who art thou, my daughter?’ And she told her all that the man had done to her. 17And she said: ‘These six measures of barley gave he me; for he said to me: Go not empty unto thy mother-in-law.’ 18Then said she: ‘Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall; for the man will not rest, until he have finished the thing this day.’
<br>Now Boaz went up to the gate, and sat him down there; and, behold, the near kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by; unto whom he said: ‘Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here.’ And he turned aside, and sat down. 2And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said: ‘Sit ye down here.’ And they sat down. 3And he	said	unto	the	near	kinsman: ‘Naomi, that is come back out of the field of Moab, selleth the parcel of land,	which	was		our		brother Elimelech’s; 4and I thought to disclose it unto thee, saying: Buy it before them that sit here, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it; but if it will not be redeemed, then tell me, that I may know; for there is none to redeem it beside thee; and I am after thee.’ And he said: ‘I will redeem it.’ 5Then said Boaz: ‘What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi—hast thou also
<br> 
<br>bought of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance?’ 6And the near kinsman said: ‘I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance; take thou my right of redemption on thee; for I cannot redeem it.’— 7Now this was the custom in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging, to confirm all things: a man drew off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour; and this was the attestation in Israel.— 8So the near kinsman said unto Boaz: ‘Buy it for thyself.’ And he drew off his shoe. 9And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people: ‘Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech’s, and all that was Chilion’s and Mahlon’s, of the hand of Naomi. 10Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I acquired to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place; ye are witnesses this day.’ 11And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said: ‘We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come into thy house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel; and do thou worthily in Ephrath, and be famous in Beth- lehem; 12and let thy house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore unto Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this young woman.’
<br> 
<br>13So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife; and he went in unto her, and the LORD gave her conception, and she bore a son. 14And the women said unto Naomi: ‘Blessed be the LORD, who hath not left thee this day without a near kinsman, and let his name be famous in Israel. 15And he shall be unto thee a restorer of life, and a nourisher of thine old age; for thy daughter-in-law, who loveth thee, who is better to thee than seven sons, hath borne him.’ 16And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it. 17And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying: ‘There is a son born to Naomi’; and they called his name Obed; he is the father of Jesse, the father of David. 18Now these are the generations of Perez: Perez begot Hezron; 19and Hezron begot Ram, and Ram begot Amminadab; 20and Amminadab begot Nahshon, and Nahshon begot aSalmon; 21and Salmon begot Boaz, and Boaz begot Obed; 22and Obed begot Jesse, and Jesse begot David.

<br>א HOW DOTH the city sit solitary, That was full of people!
<br>How is she become as a widow!
<br>She that was great among the nations,
<br>And princess among the provinces, How is she become tributary!
<br>ב 2She weepeth sore in the night, And her tears are on her cheeks; She hath none to comfort her Among all her lovers;
<br>All her friends have dealt treacherously with her,
<br>They are become her enemies.
<br>ג 3Judah is gone into exile because of affliction,
<br>And because of great servitude; She dwelleth among the nations, She findeth no rest;
<br>All her pursuers overtook her Within the straits.
<br>ד 4The ways of Zion do mourn,
<br>Because none come to the solemn assembly;
<br>All her gates are desolate, Her priests sigh;
<br>Her virgins are afflicted,
<br>And she herself is in bitterness. ה 5Her adversaries are become the
<br>head,
<br>Her enemies are at ease;
<br>For the LORD hath afflicted her For the multitude of her
<br>transgressions;
<br> 
<br>Her young children are gone into captivity
<br>Before the adversary.
<br>ו 6And gone is from the daughter of Zion
<br>All her splendour;
<br>Her princes are become like harts That find no pasture,
<br>And they are gone without strength Before the pursuer.
<br>
<br>ז 7Jerusalem remembereth
<br>In the days of her affliction and of her anguish
<br>All her treasures that she had From the days of old;
<br>Now that her people fall by the hand of the adversary,
<br>And none doth help her,
<br>The adversaries have seen her,
<br>They have mocked at her desolations.
<br>ח 8Jerusalem hath grievously sinned,
<br>Therefore she is become as one unclean;
<br>All that honoured her despise her,
<br>Because they have seen her nakedness;
<br>She herself also sigheth, And turneth backward.
<br>ט 9Her filthiness was in her skirts, She was not mindful of her end;
<br>Therefore is she come down wonderfully,
<br>She hath no comforter.
<br> 
<br>’Behold, O LORD, my affliction,
<br>For the enemy hath magnified himself.’
<br>י 10The adversary hath spread out his hand
<br>Upon all her treasures;
<br>For she hath seen that the heathen Are entered into her sanctuary,
<br>Concerning whom Thou didst command
<br>That they should not enter into Thy congregation.
<br>כ 11All her people sigh, They seek bread;
<br>They have given their pleasant things for food
<br>To refresh the soul.
<br>‘See, O LORD, and behold, How abject I am become.’
<br>
<br>ל 12’Let it not come unto you, all ye that pass by!
<br>Behold, and see
<br>If there be any pain like unto my pain,
<br>Which is done unto me,
<br>Wherewith the LORD hath afflicted me
<br>In the day of His fierce anger.
<br>מ 13From on high hath He sent fire Into my bones, and it prevaileth
<br>against them;
<br>He hath spread a net for my feet, He hath turned me back;
<br>He hath made me desolate And faint all the day.
<br>נ 14The yoke of my transgressions is impressed by His hand;
<br>They are knit together,
<br> 
<br>They are come up upon my neck; He hath made my strength to fail;
<br>The Lord hath delivered me into their hands,
<br>Against whom I am not able to stand.
<br>ס 15The Lord hath set at nought
<br>All my mighty men in the midst of me;
<br>He hath called a solemn assembly against me
<br>To crush my young men;
<br>The Lord hath trodden as in a winepress
<br>The virgin the daughter of Judah.’ ע 16’For these things I weep;
<br>Mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water;
<br>Because the comforter is far from me,
<br>Even he that should refresh my soul; My children are desolate,
<br>Because the enemy hath prevailed.’ פ 17Zion spreadeth forth her hands;
<br>There is none to comfort her;
<br>The LORD hath commanded concerning Jacob,
<br>That they that are round about him should be his adversaries;
<br>Jerusalem is among them As one unclean.
<br>
<br>צ 18’The LORD is righteous;
<br>For I have rebelled against His word;
<br>Hear, I pray you, all ye peoples, And behold my pain:

<br>My priests and mine elders Perished in the city,
<br>While they sought them food To refresh their souls.
<br>ר 20Behold, O LORD, for I am in distress,
<br>Mine inwards burn;
<br>My heart is turned within me, For I have grievously rebelled. Abroad the sword bereaveth,
<br>At home there is the like of death. ש 21They have heard that I sigh,
<br>There is none to comfort me;
<br>All mine enemies have heard of my trouble, and are glad,
<br>For Thou hast done it;
<br>Thou wilt bring the day that Thou hast proclaimed,
<br>And they shall be like unto me. ת 22Let all their wickedness come
<br>before Thee; And do unto them,
<br>As Thou hast done unto me For all my transgressions; For my sighs are many And my heart is faint.’
<br>
<br>א How hath the Lord covered with a cloud
<br>The daughter of Zion in His anger!
<br>He hath cast down from heaven unto the earth
<br>The beauty of Israel,
<br>And hath not remembered His footstool
<br>In the day of His anger.
<br> 
<br>ב 2The Lord hath swallowed up unsparingly
<br>All the habitations of Jacob;
<br>He hath thrown down in His wrath The strongholds of the daughter of
<br>Judah;
<br>He hath brought them down to the ground;
<br>He hath profaned the kingdom and the princes thereof.
<br>ג 3He hath cut off in fierce anger All the horn of Israel;
<br>He hath drawn back His right hand From before the enemy;
<br>And He hath burned in Jacob like a flaming fire,
<br>Which devoureth round about. ד 4He hath bent His bow like an
<br>enemy,
<br>Standing with His right hand as an adversary,
<br>And hath slain all that were pleasant to the eye;
<br>In the tent of the daughter of Zion He hath poured out His fury like
<br>fire.
<br>ה 5The Lord is become as an enemy, He hath swallowed up Israel;
<br>He hath swallowed up all her palaces,
<br>He hath destroyed his strongholds;
<br>And He hath multiplied in the daughter of Judah
<br>Mourning and moaning.
<br>ו 6And He hath stripped His tabernacle, as if it were a garden,
<br>He hath destroyed His place of assembly;
<br> 
<br>The LORD hath caused to be forgotten in Zion
<br>Appointed season and sabbath,
<br>And hath rejected in the indignation of His anger
<br>The king and the priest.
<br>ז 7The Lord hath cast off His altar, He hath abhorred His sanctuary,
<br>He hath given up into the hand of the enemy
<br>The walls of her palaces;
<br>They have made a noise in the house of the LORD,
<br>As in the day of a solemn assembly. ח 8The LORD hath purposed to destroy
<br>The wall of the daughter of Zion; He hath stretched out the line, He hath not withdrawn
<br>His hand from destroying;
<br>But He hath made the rampart and wall to mourn,
<br>They languish together.
<br>ט 9Her gates are sunk into the ground;
<br>He hath destroyed and broken her bars;
<br>Her king and her princes are among the nations,
<br>Instruction is no more; Yea, her prophets find No vision from the LORD.
<br>י 10They sit upon the ground, and keep silence,
<br>The elders of the daughter of Zion;
<br>They have cast up dust upon their heads,
<br>They have girded themselves with sackcloth;
<br>The virgins of Jerusalem hang down Their heads to the ground.
<br> 
<br>כ 11Mine eyes do fail with tears, Mine inwards burn,
<br>My liver is poured upon the earth,
<br>For the breach of the daughter of my people;
<br>Because the young children and the sucklings swoon
<br>In the broad places of the city. ל 12They say to their mothers:
<br>‘Where is corn and wine?’
<br>When they swoon as the wounded In the broad places of the city, When their soul is poured out Into their mothers’bosom.
<br>מ 13What shall I take to witness for thee?
<br>What shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem?
<br>What shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort thee,
<br>O virgin daughter of Zion?
<br>For thy breach is great like the sea; Who can heal thee?
<br>נ 14Thy prophets have seen visions for thee
<br>Of vanity and delusion;
<br>And they have not uncovered thine iniquity,
<br>To bring back thy captivity;
<br>But have prophesied for thee burdens
<br>Of vanity and seduction. ס 15All that pass by clap
<br>Their hands at thee;
<br>They hiss and wag their head At the daughter of Jerusalem: ‘Is this the city that men called The perfection of beauty,
<br>The joy of the whole earth?’
<br> 
<br>פ 16All thine enemies have opened Their mouth wide against thee; They hiss and gnash the teeth;
<br>They say: ‘We have swallowed her up;
<br>Certainly this is the day that we looked for;
<br>We have found, we have seen it.’
<br>ע 17The LORD hath done that which He devised;
<br>He hath performed His word
<br>That He commanded in the days of old;
<br>He hath thrown down unsparingly;
<br>And He hath caused the enemy to rejoice over thee,
<br>He hath exalted the horn of thine adversaries.
<br>
<br>צ 18Their heart cried unto the Lord: ‘O wall of the daughter of Zion, Let tears run down like a river Day and night;
<br>Give thyself no respite;
<br>Let not the apple of thine eye cease. ק 19Arise, cry out in the night,
<br>At the beginning of the watches; Pour out thy heart like water Before the face of the Lord;
<br>Lift up thy hands toward Him
<br>For the life of thy young children, That faint for hunger
<br>At the head of every street.’ ר 20’See, O LORD, and consider,
<br>To whom Thou hast done thus! Shall the women eat their fruit,
<br>The children that are dandled in the hands?
<br> 
<br>Shall the priest and the prophet be slain
<br>In the sanctuary of the Lord?
<br>ש 21The youth and the old man lie On the ground in the streets; My virgins and my young men Are fallen by the sword;
<br>Thou hast slain them in the day of Thine anger;
<br>Thou hast slaughtered unsparingly. ת 22Thou hast called, as in the day of a
<br>solemn assembly,
<br>My terrors on every side,
<br>And there was none in the day of the LORD’S anger
<br>That escaped or remained;
<br>Those that I have dandled and brought up
<br>Hath mine enemy consumed.’
<br>
<br>א
<br>I am the man that hath seen affliction
<br>By the rod of His wrath.
<br>2He hath led me and caused me to walk in darkness and not in light.
<br>3Surely against me He turneth His hand again and again all the day.
<br>ב
<br>4My flesh and my skin hath He worn out;
<br>He hath broken my bones.
<br>5He hath builded against me, and compassed me
<br>With gall and travail.
<br>6He hath made me to dwell in dark places,
<br>As those that have been long dead.
<br>ג
<br> 
<br>7He hath hedged me about, that I cannot go forth;
<br>He hath made my chain heavy.
<br>8Yea, when I cry and call for help, He shutteth out my prayer.
<br>9He hath enclosed my ways with hewn stone,
<br>He hath made my paths crooked.
<br>ד
<br>10He is unto me as a bear lying in wait,
<br>As a lion in secret places.
<br>11He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces;
<br>He hath made me desolate.
<br>12He hath bent His bow, and set me As a mark for the arrow.
<br>ה
<br>13He hath caused the arrows of His quiver
<br>To enter into my reins.
<br>14I am become a derision to all my people,
<br>And their song all the day.
<br>15He hath filled me with bitterness, He hath sated me with wormwood.
<br>ו
<br>16He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones,
<br>He hath made me to wallow in ashes.
<br>17And my soul is removed far off from peace,
<br>I forgot prosperity.
<br>18And I said: ‘My strength is perished,
<br>And mine expectation from the LORD.’
<br>ז
<br> 
<br>19Remember mine affliction and mine anguish,
<br>The wormwood and the gall.
<br>20My soul hath them still in remembrance,
<br>And is bowed down within me.
<br>21This I recall to my mind, Therefore have I hope.
<br>ח
<br>22Surely the LORD’S mercies are not consumed,
<br>Surely His compassions fail not. 23They are new every morning; Great is Thy faithfulness.
<br>24’The LORD is my portion’, saith my soul;
<br>‘Therefore will I hope in Him.’
<br>ט
<br>25The LORD is good unto them that wait for Him,
<br>To the soul that seeketh Him.
<br>26It is good that a man should quietly wait
<br>For the salvation of the LORD.
<br>27It is good for a man that he bear The yoke in his youth.
<br>י
<br>28Let him sit alone and keep silence, Because He hath laid it upon him.
<br>29Let him put his mouth in the dust, If so be there may be hope.
<br>30Let him give his cheek to him that smiteth him
<br>Let him be filled full with reproach.
<br>כ
<br>31For the Lord will not cast off For ever.
<br>32For though He cause grief, yet will He have compassion
<br> 
<br>According to the multitude of His mercies.
<br>33For He doth not afflict willingly, Nor grieve the children of men.
<br>ל
<br>34To crush under foot
<br>All the prisoners of the earth, 35To turn aside the right of a man Before the face of the Most High, 36To subvert a man in his cause, The Lord approveth not.
<br>מ
<br>37Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass,
<br>When the Lord commandeth it not?
<br>38Out of the mouth of the Most High proceedeth not
<br>Evil and good?
<br>39Wherefore doth a living man complain,
<br>A strong man because of his sins?
<br>נ
<br>40Let us search and try our ways, And return to the LORD.
<br>41Let us lift up our heart with our hands
<br>Unto God in the heavens.
<br>42We have transgressed and have rebelled;
<br>Thou hast not pardoned.
<br>ס
<br>43Thou hast covered with anger and pursued us;
<br>Thou hast slain unsparingly.
<br>44Thou hast covered Thyself with a cloud,
<br>So that no prayer can pass through.
<br>45Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse

<br>פ
<br>46All our enemies have opened their mouth
<br>Wide against us.
<br>47Terror and the pit are come upon us,
<br>Desolation and destruction.
<br>48Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water,
<br>For the breach of the daughter of my people.
<br>ע
<br>49Mine eye is poured out, and ceaseth not,
<br>Without any intermission, 50Till the LORD look forth, And behold from heaven. 51Mine eye affected my soul,
<br>Because of all the daughters of my city.
<br>צ
<br>52They have chased me sore like a bird,
<br>That are mine enemies without cause.
<br>53They have cut off my life in the dungeon,
<br>And have cast stones upon me. 54Waters flowed over my head; I said: ‘I am cut off.’
<br>ק
<br>55I called upon Thy name, O LORD, Out of the lowest dungeon.
<br>56Thou heardest my voice; hide not Thine ear at my sighing, at my cry. 57Thou drewest near in the day that I
<br>called upon Thee; Thou saidst: ‘Fear not.’
<br> 
<br>ר
<br>58O Lord, Thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul;
<br>Thou hast redeemed my life.
<br>59O LORD, Thou hast seen my wrong;
<br>Judge Thou my cause.
<br>60Thou hast seen all their vengeance And all their devices against me.
<br>ש
<br>61Thou hast heard their taunt, O LORD,
<br>And all their devices against me;
<br>62The lips of those that rose up against me,
<br>And their muttering against me all the day.
<br>63Behold Thou their sitting down, and their rising up;
<br>I am their song.
<br>ת
<br>64Thou wilt render unto them a recompense, O LORD,
<br>According to the work of their hands.
<br>65Thou wilt give them hardness of heart,
<br>Thy curse unto them.
<br>66Thou wilt pursue them in anger, and destroy them
<br>From under the heavens of the LORD.

<br>How are they esteemed as earthen pitchers,
<br>The work of the hands of the potter!
<br>ג 3Even the jackals draw out the breast,
<br>They give suck to their young ones;
<br>The daughter of my people is become cruel,
<br>Like the ostriches in the wilderness.
<br>ד 4The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth
<br>To the roof of his mouth for thirst; The young children ask bread, And none breaketh it unto them.
<br>ה 5They that did feed on dainties Are desolate in the streets;
<br>They that were brought up in scarlet Embrace dunghills.
<br>ו 6For the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater
<br>Than the sin of Sodom,
<br>That was overthrown as in a moment,
<br>And no hands fell upon her.
<br>ז 7Her princes were purer than snow, They were whiter than milk,
<br>They were more ruddy in body than rubies,
<br>Their polishing was as of sapphire;
<br>ח 8Their visage is blacker than a coal; They are not known in the streets;
<br>Their skin is shrivelled upon their bones;
<br>It is withered, it is become like a stick.
<br>ט 9They that are slain with the sword are better
<br>Than they that are slain with hunger;
<br> 
<br>For these pine away, stricken through,
<br>For want of the fruits of the field.

<br>Have sodden their own children; They were their food

<br>ס 15’Depart ye! unclean! ’ men cried unto them,
<br>‘Depart, depart, touch not’;
<br>Yea, they fled away and wandered; Men said among the nations: ‘They shall no more sojourn here.’
<br> 
<br>פ 16The anger of the LORD hath divided them;
<br>He will no more regard them;
<br>They respected not the persons of the priests,
<br>They were not gracious unto the elders.
<br>
<br>ע 17As for us, our eyes do yet fail For our vain help;
<br>In our watching we have watched For a nation that could not save.
<br>צ 18They hunt our steps,
<br>That we cannot go in our broad places;
<br>Our end is near, our days are fulfilled;
<br>For our end is come.
<br>ק 19Our pursuers were swifter Than the eagles of the heaven;
<br>They chased us upon the mountains,
<br>They lay in wait for us in the wilderness.
<br>ר 20The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD,
<br>Was taken in their pits;
<br>Of whom we said: ‘Under his shadow
<br>We shall live among the nations.’
<br>ש 21Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom,
<br>That dwellest in the land of Uz:
<br>The cup shall pass over unto thee also;
<br>Thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked.
<br>ת 22The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion,
<br> 
<br>He will no more carry thee away into captivity;
<br>He will punish thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom,
<br>He will uncover thy sins.
<br>
<br>Remember, O LORD, what is come upon us;
<br>Behold, and see our reproach.
<br>2Our inheritance is turned unto strangers,
<br>Our houses unto aliens.
<br>3We are become orphans and fatherless,
<br>Our mothers are as widows.
<br>4We have drunk our water for money;
<br>Our wood cometh to us for price. 5To our very necks we are pursued; We labour, and have no rest.
<br>6We have given the hand to Egypt,
<br>And to Assyria, to have bread enough;
<br>7Our fathers have sinned, and are not;
<br>And we have borne their iniquities.
<br>8Servants rule over us;
<br>There is none to deliver us out of their hand.
<br>9We get our bread with the peril of our lives
<br>Because of the sword of the wilderness.
<br>10Our skin is hot like an oven Because of the burning heat of
<br>famine.
<br>11They have ravished the women in Zion,
<br>The maidens in the cities of Judah.
<br> 
<br>12Princes are hanged up by their hand;
<br>The faces of elders are not honoured.
<br>13The young men have borne the mill,
<br>And the children have stumbled under the wood.
<br>14The elders have ceased from the gate,
<br>The young men from their music. 15The joy of our heart is ceased; Our dance is turned into mourning.
<br>16The crown is fallen from our head; Woe unto us! for we have sinned.
<br>
<br>17For this our heart is faint,
<br>For these things our eyes are dim;
<br>18For the mountain of Zion, which is desolate,
<br>The foxes walk upon it.
<br>19Thou, O LORD, art enthroned for ever,
<br>Thy throne is from generation to generation.
<br>20Wherefore dost Thou forget us for ever,
<br>And forsake us so long time?
<br>21Turn Thou us unto Thee, O LORD, and we shall be turned;
<br>Renew our days as of old.
<br>22Thou canst not have utterly rejected us,
<br>And be exceeding wroth against us!
<br>Turn us unto Thee, O Lord, and we shall be turned;
<br>Renew our days as of old.

<br>קהלת
<br>ECCLESIASTES
<br> 
<br>THE WORDs OF the Koheleth, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.
<br>
<br>2Vanity of vanities, saith Koheleth; Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.
<br>
<br>3What profit hath man of all his labour
<br>Wherein he laboureth under the sun?
<br>4One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh;
<br>And the earth abideth for ever.
<br>5The sun also ariseth, And the sun goeth down,
<br>And hasteth to his place where he ariseth.
<br>6The wind goeth toward the south, And turneth about unto the north;
<br>It turneth about continually in its circuit,
<br>And the wind returneth again to its circuits.
<br>7All the rivers run into the sea, Yet the sea is not full;
<br>Unto the place whither the rivers go, Thither they go again.
<br>8All things toil to weariness; Man cannot utter it,
<br>The eye is not satisfied with seeing, Nor the ear filled with hearing.
<br>9That which hath been is that which shall be,
<br> 
<br>And that which hath been done is that which shall be done;
<br>And there is nothing new under the sun.
<br>10Is there a thing whereof it is said: ‘See, this is new’?—it hath been already, in the ages which were before us. 11There is no remembrance of them of former times; neither shall there be any remembrance of them of latter times that are to come, among those that shall come after.
<br>
<br>12I Koheleth have been king over Israel in Jerusalem. 13And I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven; it is a sore task that God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith. 14I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and a striving after wind.
<br>15That which is crooked cannot be made straight;
<br>And that which is wanting cannot be numbered.
<br>16I spoke with my own heart, saying: ‘Lo, I have gotten great wisdom, more also than all that were before me over Jerusalem’; yea, my heart hath had great experience of wisdom and knowledge. 17And I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know
<br> 
<br>madness and folly—I perceived that this also was a striving after wind.
<br>18For in much wisdom is much vexation;
<br>And he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.
<br>
<br>I said in my heart: ‘Come now, I will try thee with mirth, and enjoy pleasure’; and, behold, this also was vanity. 2I said of laughter: ‘It is mad’; and	of		mirth:	‘What	doth		it accomplish?’ 3I searched in my heart how to pamper my flesh with wine, and, my heart conducting itself with wisdom, how yet to lay hold on folly, till I might see which it was best for the sons of men that they should do under the heaven the few days of their life. 4I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards; 5I made me gardens and parks, and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit; 6I made me pools of water, to water therefrom the wood springing up with trees; 7I acquired men-servants and maid-servants, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of herds and flocks, above all that were before me in Jerusalem; 8I gathered me also silver and gold, and treasure	such	as		kings	and	the provinces have as their own; I got me men-singers and women-singers, and the delights of the sons of men, women very many. 9So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem; also my wisdom stood me in stead. 10And
<br> 
<br>whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them; I withheld not my heart from any joy, for my heart had joy of all my labour; and this was my portion from all my labour. 11Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do; and, behold, all was vanity and a striving after wind, and there was no profit under the sun.
<br>12And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness and folly; for what can the man do that cometh after the king? even that which hath been already done. 13Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.
<br>14The wise man, his eyes are in his head;
<br>But the fool walketh in darkness.
<br>And I also perceived that one event happeneth to them all. 15Then said I in my heart: ‘As it happeneth to the fool, so will it happen even to me; and why was I then more wise?’ Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity. 16For of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is no remembrance for ever; seeing that in the days to come all will long ago have been forgotten. And how must the wise man die even as the fool! 17So I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun was grievous unto me; for all is vanity and a striving after wind.
<br>18And I hated all my labour wherein I laboured under the sun, seeing that I must leave it unto the man that shall be after me. 19And who knoweth whether
<br> 
<br>he will be a wise man or a fool? yet will he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shown myself wise under the sun. This also is vanity. 20Therefore I turned about to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labour wherein I had laboured under the sun. 21For there is a man whose labour is with wisdom, and with knowledge, and with skill; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil. 22For what hath a man of all his labour, and of the striving of his heart, wherein he laboureth under the sun? 23For all his days are pains, and his occupation vexation; yea, even in the night his heart taketh not rest. This also is vanity.
<br>24There is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink, and make his soul enjoy pleasure for his labour. This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God. 25For who will eat, or who will enjoy, if not I? 26For to the man that is good in His sight He giveth wisdom, and knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner He giveth the task, to gather and to heap up, that he may leave to him that is good in the sight of God. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.
<br>To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under
<br>the heaven:
<br>2A time to be born, and a time to die;
<br> 
<br>A time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;
<br>3A time to kill, and a time to heal;
<br>A time to break down, and a time to build up;
<br>4A time to weep, and a time to laugh;
<br>A time to mourn, and a time to dance;
<br>5A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together;
<br>A time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;
<br>6A time to seek, and a time to lose;
<br>A time to keep, and a time to cast away;
<br>7A time to rend, and a time to sew;
<br>A time to keep silence, and a time to speak;
<br>8A time to love, and a time to hate;
<br>A time for war, and a time for peace.
<br>9What profit hath he that worketh in that he laboureth? 10I have seen the task which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith. 11He hath made every thing beautiful in its time; also He hath set the world in their heart, yet so that man cannot find out the work that God hath done from the beginning even to the end. 12I know that there is nothing better for them, than to rejoice, and to get pleasure so long as they live. 13But also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy pleasure for all his labour, is the gift of God. 14I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever; nothing can be added to it,
<br> 
<br>nor any thing taken from it; and God hath so made it, that men should fear before Him. 15That which is hath been long ago, and that which is to be hath already been; and God seeketh that which is pursued.
<br>16And moreover I saw under the sun, in the place of justice, that wickedness was there; and in the place of righteousness, that wickedness was there. 17I said in my heart: ‘The righteous and the wicked God will judge; for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.’ 18I said in my heart: ‘It is because of the sons of men, that God may sift them, and that they may see that they themselves are but as beasts.’ 19For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them; as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that man hath no pre- eminence above a beast; for all is vanity. 20All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all return to dust. 21Who knoweth the spirit of man whether it goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast whether it goeth downward to the earth? 22Wherefore I perceived that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his works; for that is his portion; for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?
<br>But I returned and considered all the oppressions   that   are   done under the sun; and behold the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had
<br> 
<br>no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power, but they had no comforter. 2Wherefore I praised the dead that are already dead more than the living that are yet alive; 3but better than they both is he that hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.
<br>4Again, I considered all labour and all excelling in work, that it is a man’s rivalry with his neighbour. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.
<br>5The fool foldeth his hands together, And eateth his own flesh.
<br>6Better is a handful of quietness,
<br>Than both the hands full of labour and striving after wind.
<br>7Then I returned and saw vanity under the sun. 8There is one that is alone, and he hath not a second; yea, he hath neither son nor brother; yet is there no end of all his labour, neither is his eye satisfied with riches: ‘for whom then do I labour, and bereave my soul of pleasure?’ This also is vanity, yea, it is a grievous business. 9Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour. 10For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him that is alone when he falleth, and hath not another to lift him up. 11Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth; but how can one be warm alone? 12And if a man prevail against him that is alone, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.
<br>13Better is a poor and wise child than an old and foolish king, who
<br> 
<br>knoweth not how to receive admonition any more. 14For out of prison he came forth to be king; although in his kingdom he was born poor. 15I saw all the living that walk under the sun, that they were with the child, the second, that was to stand up in his stead. 16There was no end of all the people, even of all them whom he did lead; yet they that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a striving after wind.
<br>17Guard thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be ready to hearken: it is better than when fools give sacrifices; for they know not that they do evil.
<br>Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be hasty to utter a word before God; for God is in heaven, and thou upon earth; therefore
<br>let thy words be few.
<br>2For a dream cometh through a multitude of business;
<br>And a fool’s voice through a multitude of words.
<br>3When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for He hath no pleasure in fools; pay that which thou vowest. 4Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay. 5Suffer not thy mouth to bring thy flesh into guilt, neither say thou before the messenger, that it was an error; wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thy hands? 6For through the multitude of
