<br>
<br>In paragraph (2), the term "vessel of the United States" is omitted because the definition of that term in 46 U.S.C. 2101 is being moved to chapter 1 of the revised title and will apply generally throughout the title.
<br>
<br>In paragraph (3), the definition of "Secretary" is new. The functions of the Secretary of Transportation under this chapter were carried out by the Coast Guard, and its functions have been transferred to the Department of Homeland Security (except when operating as a service in the Navy) by section 888 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Pub. L. 107–296, 116 Stat. 2249).
<br>§70302. International measures for seaport and vessel security
<br>
<br>Congress encourages the President to continue to seek agreement on international seaport and vessel security through the International Maritime Organization. In developing an agreement, each member country of the International Maritime Organization should consult with appropriate private sector interests in that country. The agreement would establish seaport and vessel security measures and could include—
<br>
<br>(1) seaport screening of cargo and baggage similar to that done at airports;
<br>
<br>(2) security measures to restrict access to cargo, vessels, and dockside property to authorized personnel only;
<br>
<br>(3) additional security on board vessels;
<br>
<br>(4) licensing or certification of compliance with appropriate security standards; and
<br>
<br>(5) other appropriate measures to prevent unlawful acts against passengers and crews on vessels.

<br>§70303. Security standards at foreign ports
<br>
<br>(a) General Requirements.—The Secretary shall develop and implement a plan to assess the effectiveness of the security measures maintained at foreign ports that the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of State, determines pose a high risk of acts of terrorism against passenger vessels.

<br>
<br>(b) Notice and Recommendations to Other Countries.—If the Secretary, after implementing the plan under subsection (a), determines that a port does not maintain and administer effective security measures, the Secretary of State (after being informed by the Secretary) shall—
<br>
<br>(1) notify the appropriate government authorities of the country in which the port is located of the determination; and
<br>
<br>(2) recommend steps necessary to bring the security measures at that port up to the standard used by the Secretary in making the assessment under subsection (a).
<br>
<br>(c) Antiterrorism Assistance.—The President is encouraged to provide antiterrorism assistance related to maritime security under chapter 8 of part II of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2349aa et seq.) to foreign countries, especially for a port that the Secretary determines under subsection (b) does not maintain and administer effective security measures.

The suspension may be without notice or hearing and for as long as the President determines is necessary to ensure the security of passenger vessels against unlawful seizure.
