<br>§3738. Assistance from United States private sector to prevent and reduce HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa
<br>
<br>It is the sense of the Congress that United States businesses should be encouraged to provide assistance to sub-Saharan African countries to prevent and reduce the incidence of HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. In providing such assistance, United States businesses should be encouraged to consider the establishment of an HIV/AIDS Response Fund in order to provide for coordination among such businesses in the collection and distribution of the assistance to sub-Saharan African countries.

<br>§3739. Sense of the Congress relating to HIV/AIDS crisis in sub-Saharan Africa
<br>(a) Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds the following:
<br>
<br>(1) Sustained economic development in sub-Saharan Africa depends in large measure upon successful trade with and foreign assistance to the countries of sub-Saharan Africa.
<br>
<br>(2) The HIV/AIDS crisis has reached epidemic proportions in sub-Saharan Africa, where more than 21,000,000 men, women, and children are infected with HIV.
<br>
<br>(3) Eighty-three percent of the estimated 11,700,000 deaths from HIV/AIDS worldwide have been in sub-Saharan Africa.
<br>
<br>(4) The HIV/AIDS crisis in sub-Saharan Africa is weakening the structure of families and societies.
<br>
<br>(5)(A) The HIV/AIDS crisis threatens the future of the workforce in sub-Saharan Africa.
<br>
<br>(B) Studies show that HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa most severely affects individuals between the ages of 15 and 49—the age group that provides the most support for the economies of sub-Saharan African countries.
<br>
<br>(6) Clear evidence demonstrates that HIV/AIDS is destructive to the economies of sub-Saharan African countries.
<br>
<br>(7) Sustained economic development is critical to creating the public and private sector resources in sub-Saharan Africa necessary to fight the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
<br>(b) Sense of the Congress
<br>
<br>It is the sense of the Congress that—
<br>
<br>(1) addressing the HIV/AIDS crisis in sub-Saharan Africa should be a central component of United States foreign policy with respect to sub-Saharan Africa;
<br>
<br>(2) significant progress needs to be made in preventing and treating HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa in order to sustain a mutually beneficial trade relationship between the United States and sub-Saharan African countries; and
<br>
<br>(3) the HIV/AIDS crisis in sub-Saharan Africa is a global threat that merits further attention through greatly expanded public, private, and joint public-private efforts, and through appropriate United States legislation.

<br>
<br>(1) desertification affects approximately one-sixth of the world's population and one-quarter of the total land area;
<br>
<br>(2) over 1,000,000 hectares of Africa are affected by desertification;

<br>
<br>(5) the United States can strengthen its partnerships throughout Africa and other countries affected by desertification, help alleviate social and economic crises caused by misuse of natural resources, and reduce dependence on foreign aid, by taking a leading role to combat desertification.
<br>(b) Sense of the Congress
<br>
<br>It is the sense of the Congress that the United States should expeditiously work with the international community, particularly Africa and other countries affected by desertification, to—
<br>
<br>(1) strengthen international cooperation to combat desertification;
<br>
<br>(2) promote the development of national and regional strategies to address desertification and increase public awareness of this serious problem and its effects;
<br>
<br>(3) develop and implement national action programs that identify the causes of desertification and measures to address it; and
<br>
<br>(4) recognize the essential role of local governments and nongovernmental organizations in developing and implementing measures to address desertification.

<br>§3801. Short title and findings
<br>(a) Short title
<br>
<br>This chapter may be cited as the "Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002".
<br>(b) Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>(1) The expansion of international trade is vital to the national security of the United States. Trade is critical to the economic growth and strength of the United States and to its leadership in the world. Stable trading relationships promote security and prosperity. Trade agreements today serve the same purposes that security pacts played during the Cold War, binding nations together through a series of mutual rights and obligations. Leadership by the United States in international trade fosters open markets, democracy, and peace throughout the world.
<br>
<br>(2) The national security of the United States depends on its economic security, which in turn is founded upon a vibrant and growing industrial base. Trade expansion has been the engine of economic growth. Trade agreements maximize opportunities for the critical sectors and building blocks of the economy of the United States, such as information technology, telecommunications and other leading technologies, basic industries, capital equipment, medical equipment, services, agriculture, environmental technology, and intellectual property. Trade will create new opportunities for the United States and preserve the unparalleled strength of the United States in economic, political, and military affairs. The United States, secured by expanding trade and economic opportunities, will meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.
<br>
<br>(3) Support for continued trade expansion requires that dispute settlement procedures under international trade agreements not add to or diminish the rights and obligations provided in such agreements. Therefore—
<br>
<br>(A) the recent pattern of decisions by dispute settlement panels of the WTO and the Appellate Body to impose obligations and restrictions on the use of antidumping, countervailing, and safeguard measures by WTO members under the Antidumping Agreement, the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, and the Agreement on Safeguards has raised concerns; and
<br>
<br>(B) the Congress is concerned that dispute settlement panels of the WTO and the Appellate Body appropriately apply the standard of review contained in Article 17.6 of the Antidumping Agreement, to provide deference to a permissible interpretation by a WTO member of provisions of that Agreement, and to the evaluation by a WTO member of the facts where that evaluation is unbiased and objective and the establishment of the facts is proper.

<br>
<br>(I) giving priority to those products that are subject to significantly higher tariffs or subsidy regimes of major producing countries; and
<br>

<br>
<br>(ii) reducing tariffs to levels that are the same as or lower than those in the United States;
<br>

<br>
<br>(v) developing disciplines for domestic support programs, so that production that is in excess of domestic food security needs is sold at world prices;
<br>
<br>(vi) eliminating government policies that create price-depressing surpluses;
<br>
<br>(vii) eliminating state trading enterprises whenever possible;
<br>
<br>(viii) developing, strengthening, and clarifying rules and effective dispute settlement mechanisms to eliminate practices that unfairly decrease United States market access opportunities or distort agricultural markets to the detriment of the United States, particularly with respect to import-sensitive products, including—
<br>
<br>(I) unfair or trade-distorting activities of state trading enterprises and other administrative mechanisms, with emphasis on requiring price transparency in the operation of state trading enterprises and such other mechanisms in order to end cross subsidization, price discrimination, and price undercutting;
<br>

<br>
<br>(xi) taking into account whether a party to the negotiations has failed to adhere to the provisions of already existing trade agreements with the United States or has circumvented obligations under those agreements;
<br>
<br>(xii) taking into account whether a product is subject to market distortions by reason of a failure of a major producing country to adhere to the provisions of already existing trade agreements with the United States or by the circumvention by that country of its obligations under those agreements;

<br>(xiii) otherwise ensuring that countries that accede to the World Trade Organization have made meaningful market liberalization commitments in agriculture;

<br>(xiv) taking into account the impact that agreements covering agriculture to which the United States is a party, including the North American Free Trade Agreement, have on the United States agricultural industry;

<br>
<br>(B)(i) Before commencing negotiations with respect to agriculture, the United States Trade Representative, in consultation with the Congress, shall seek to develop a position on the treatment of seasonal and perishable agricultural products to be employed in the negotiations in order to develop an international consensus on the treatment of seasonal or perishable agricultural products in investigations relating to dumping and safeguards and in any other relevant area.
<br>
<br>(ii) During any negotiations on agricultural subsidies, the United States Trade Representative shall seek to establish the common base year for calculating the Aggregated Measurement of Support (as defined in the Agreement on Agriculture) as the end of each country's Uruguay Round implementation period, as reported in each country's Uruguay Round market access schedule.

<br>(11) Labor and the environment
<br>
<br>The principal negotiating objectives of the United States with respect to labor and the environment are—

<br>
<br>(B) to recognize that parties to a trade agreement retain the right to exercise discretion with respect to investigatory, prosecutorial, regulatory, and compliance matters and to make decisions regarding the allocation of resources to enforcement with respect to other labor or environmental matters determined to have higher priorities, and to recognize that a country is effectively enforcing its laws if a course of action or inaction reflects a reasonable exercise of such discretion, or results from a bona fide decision regarding the allocation of resources, and no retaliation may be authorized based on the exercise of these rights or the right to establish domestic labor standards and levels of environmental protection;
<br>
<br>(C) to strengthen the capacity of United States trading partners to promote respect for core labor standards (as defined in section 3813(6) of this title);
<br>
<br>(D) to strengthen the capacity of United States trading partners to protect the environment through the promotion of sustainable development;

<br>(12) Dispute settlement and enforcement
<br>
<br>The principal negotiating objectives of the United States with respect to dispute settlement and enforcement of trade agreements are—
<br>
<br>(A) to seek provisions in trade agreements providing for resolution of disputes between governments under those trade agreements in an effective, timely, transparent, equitable, and reasoned manner, requiring determinations based on facts and the principles of the agreements, with the goal of increasing compliance with the agreements;
<br>
<br>(B) to seek to strengthen the capacity of the Trade Policy Review Mechanism of the World Trade Organization to review compliance with commitments;

<br>(C) to seek adherence by panels convened under the Dispute Settlement Understanding and by the Appellate Body to the standard of review applicable under the Uruguay Round Agreement involved in the dispute, including greater deference, where appropriate, to the fact-finding and technical expertise of national investigating authorities;
<br>
<br>(D) to seek provisions encouraging the early identification and settlement of disputes through consultation;
<br>
<br>(E) to seek provisions to encourage the provision of trade-expanding compensation if a party to a dispute under the agreement does not come into compliance with its obligations under the agreement;
<br>
<br>(F) to seek provisions to impose a penalty upon a party to a dispute under the agreement that—
<br>
<br>(i) encourages compliance with the obligations of the agreement;
<br>
<br>(ii) is appropriate to the parties, nature, subject matter, and scope of the violation; and
<br>
<br>(iii) has the aim of not adversely affecting parties or interests not party to the dispute while maintaining the effectiveness of the enforcement mechanism; and
<br>
<br>(G) to seek provisions that treat United States principal negotiating objectives equally with respect to—
<br>
<br>(i) the ability to resort to dispute settlement under the applicable agreement;
<br>
<br>(ii) the availability of equivalent dispute settlement procedures; and
<br>
<br>(iii) the availability of equivalent remedies.

<br>
<br>The principal negotiating objectives of the United States with respect to trade remedy laws are—
<br>
<br>(A) to preserve the ability of the United States to enforce rigorously its trade laws, including the antidumping, countervailing duty, and safeguard laws, and avoid agreements that lessen the effectiveness of domestic and international disciplines on unfair trade, especially dumping and subsidies, or that lessen the effectiveness of domestic and international safeguard provisions, in order to ensure that United States workers, agricultural producers, and firms can compete fully on fair terms and enjoy the benefits of reciprocal trade concessions; and
<br>
<br>(B) to address and remedy market distortions that lead to dumping and subsidization, including overcapacity, cartelization, and market-access barriers.
<br>(15) Border taxes
<br>
<br>The principal negotiating objective of the United States regarding border taxes is to obtain a revision of the WTO rules with respect to the treatment of border adjustments for internal taxes to redress the disadvantage to countries relying primarily on direct taxes for revenue rather than indirect taxes.
<br>(16) Textile negotiations
<br>
<br>The principal negotiating objectives of the United States with respect to trade in textiles and apparel articles are to obtain competitive opportunities for United States exports of textiles and apparel in foreign markets substantially equivalent to the competitive opportunities afforded foreign exports in United States markets and to achieve fairer and more open conditions of trade in textiles and apparel.
<br>(17) Worst forms of child labor
<br>
<br>The principal negotiating objective of the United States with respect to the trade-related aspects of the worst forms of child labor are to seek commitments by parties to trade agreements to vigorously enforce their own laws prohibiting the worst forms of child labor.

<br>§3803. Trade agreements authority
<br>(a) Agreements regarding tariff barriers
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Whenever the President determines that one or more existing duties or other import restrictions of any foreign country or the United States are unduly burdening and restricting the foreign trade of the United States and that the purposes, policies, priorities, and objectives of this chapter will be promoted thereby, the President—
<br>
<br>(A) may enter into trade agreements with foreign countries before—
<br>
<br>(i) July 1, 2005; or
<br>
<br>(ii) July 1, 2007, if trade authorities procedures are extended under subsection (c); and

<br>
<br>(i) such modification or continuance of any existing duty,
<br>
<br>(ii) such continuance of existing duty-free or excise treatment, or
<br>
<br>(iii) such additional duties,

<br>
<br>No proclamation may be made under paragraph (1) that—
<br>
<br>(A) reduces any rate of duty (other than a rate of duty that does not exceed 5 percent ad valorem on August 6, 2002) to a rate of duty which is less than 50 percent of the rate of such duty that applies on August 6, 2002;

<br>
<br>Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the aggregate reduction in the rate of duty on any article which is in effect on any day pursuant to a trade agreement entered into under paragraph (1) shall not exceed the aggregate reduction which would have been in effect on such day if—
<br>
<br>(i) a reduction of 3 percent ad valorem or a reduction of one-tenth of the total reduction, whichever is greater, had taken effect on the effective date of the first reduction proclaimed under paragraph (1) to carry out such agreement with respect to such article; and

The United States International Trade Commission shall advise the President of the identity of articles that may be exempted from staging under this subparagraph.

<br>
<br>If the President determines that such action will simplify the computation of reductions under paragraph (3), the President may round an annual reduction by an amount equal to the lesser of—
<br>
<br>(A) the difference between the reduction without regard to this paragraph and the next lower whole number; or
<br>
<br>(B) one-half of 1 percent ad valorem.
<br>(5) Other limitations
<br>
<br>A rate of duty reduction that may not be proclaimed by reason of paragraph (2) may take effect only if a provision authorizing such reduction is included within an implementing bill provided for under section 3805 of this title and that bill is enacted into law.
<br>(6) Other tariff modifications
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding paragraphs (1)(B), (2)(A), (2)(C), and (3) through (5), and subject to the consultation and layover requirements of section 115 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act [19 U.S.C. 3524], the President may proclaim the modification of any duty or staged rate reduction of any duty set forth in Schedule XX, as defined in section 2(5) of that Act [19 U.S.C. 3501(5)], if the United States agrees to such modification or staged rate reduction in a negotiation for the reciprocal elimination or harmonization of duties under the auspices of the World Trade Organization.

<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>(A) Whenever the President determines that—
<br>
<br>(i) one or more existing duties or any other import restriction of any foreign country or the United States or any other barrier to, or other distortion of, international trade unduly burdens or restricts the foreign trade of the United States or adversely affects the United States economy, or
<br>
<br>(ii) the imposition of any such barrier or distortion is likely to result in such a burden, restriction, or effect,
<br>
<br>and that the purposes, policies, priorities, and objectives of this chapter will be promoted thereby, the President may enter into a trade agreement described in subparagraph (B) during the period described in subparagraph (C).
