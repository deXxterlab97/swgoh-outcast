<br>
<br>(2) The United States, and any officer or employee of the United States is not liable to an owner or operator for damages resulting from removal of an abandoned barge under this chapter.

<br>Part C—Load Lines of Vessels
<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Part C contains provisions that apply to load lines. A load line is a mark drawn on a vessel that indicates whether a vessel is overloaded. Load line requirements for international voyages are based not only on domestic law but also the 1966 International Load Line Convention.

<br>
<br>1990—Pub. L. 101–595, title VI, §603(5)(B), Nov. 16, 1990, 104 Stat. 2993, struck out item 5115 "Regulations".
<br>§5101. Definitions
<br>
<br>In this chapter—
<br>
<br>(1) "domestic voyage" means movement of a vessel between places in, or subject to the jurisdiction of, the United States, except movement between—
<br>
<br>(A) a place in a territory or possession of the United States or the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands; and
<br>
<br>(B) a place outside that territory, possession, or Trust Territory.
<br>
<br>(2) "economic benefit of the overloading" means the amount obtained by multiplying the weight of the overload (in tons) by the lesser of—
<br>
<br>(A) the average freight rate value of a ton of the vessel's cargo for the voyage; or
<br>
<br>(B) $50.
<br>
<br>(3) "existing vessel" means—
<br>
<br>(A) a vessel on a domestic voyage, the keel of which was laid, or that was at a similar stage of construction, before January 1, 1986; and
<br>
<br>(B) a vessel on a foreign voyage, the keel of which was laid, or that was at a similar stage of construction, before July 21, 1968.
<br>
<br>(4) "freeboard" means the distance from the mark of the load line assigned under this chapter to the freeboard deck.
<br>
<br>(5) "freeboard deck" means the deck or other structure the Secretary prescribes by regulation.
<br>
<br>(6) "minimum safe freeboard" means the freeboard that the Secretary decides cannot be reduced safely without limiting the operation of the vessel.
<br>
<br>(7) "weight of the overload" means the amount obtained by multiplying the number of inches that the vessel is submerged below the applicable assigned freeboard by the tons-an-inch immersion factor for the vessel at the assigned minimum safe freeboard.
<br>

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>Revised section 5101
<br>
<br>Source: Section (U.S. Code) 46 App. U.S.C. 86a.
<br>
<br>Section 5101 contains definitions that are limited to Chapter 51—Load Lines. Existing Section 46 App. U.S.C. 86a (which defines only the terms "new ship" and "existing ship") will be replaced by section 5101. Definitions of technical terms ("freeboard", "freeboard deck", and "minimum safe freeboard") have been added for clarity. The definition of the term "new ship" has been deleted because the term is not used in Chapter 51. The definition of "domestic voyage" includes the phrase "places in or subject to the jurisdiction of the United States." "Places subject to the jurisdiction of the United States" include deep water ports, production platforms, mining sites outside of territorial waters of the United States but within the United States' Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) that was established by Presidential Proclamation 5030, dated March 10, 1983, or on the outer continental shelf. The phrases "economic benefit of overloading" and "weight of the overload" have been defined for purposes of establishing a standard method of determining the value of the cargo with which a vessel is overloaded. The value of the cargo will in turn affect the maximum penalty assessed for overloading the vessel. The definition of "freeboard deck" provides the Secretary with the authority to designate as the freeboard deck either the actual deck (on standard vessels) or another structure (on non-standard vessels). Non-standard vessels, for which this regulatory flexibility is necessary, include shelter deck vessels, semi-submersible multi-hull units, container ships, surface effect vessels, and commercial submarines.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>Revised section 5102
<br>
<br>Source: Section (U.S. Code) 46 App. U.S.C. 86b, 86c, 88.
<br>
<br>The delineation of the vessels that will be subject to load line requirements is made in section 5102 as follows: subsection (a) is an all-inclusive list of vessels subject to load line requirements, followed by subsection (b) which specifically exempts those vessels to which the requirements do not apply.
<br>
<br>Section 5102(a) lists five categories of vessels which are subject to load line requirements. They are as follows:
<br>
<br>Clause (1) regarding "a vessel of the United States" includes all vessels documented under Chapter 121 of title 46 or numbered under Chapter 123 of title 46.
<br>
<br>Clause (2) regarding "a vessel on the navigable waters of the United States" includes all domestic or foreign vessels found in or on the navigable waters of the United States.
<br>
<br>Clause (3) regarding "a vessel owned by a citizen of the United States or a corporation established by or under the laws of the United States or a State, and not registered in a foreign country" includes all vessels owned by citizens of the United States (as defined in 5107(7)) [sic] and not registered under the laws of a foreign country, wherever the vessels may be located.
<br>
<br>Clause (4) regarding "a public vessel of the United States" includes all United States public vessels.
<br>
<br>Clause (5) regarding "a vessel otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of the United States" includes foreign vessels that are subject to United States jurisdiction as a result of bilateral agreements, licenses, customary international law or other means, including those using deepwater port or outer continental shelf or EEZ facilities located in areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.
<br>
<br>Section 5102(b) lists the specific exemptions from load line requirements. The specific exemptions may be grouped as follows:
<br>
<br>(a) Vessel type (ships of war, pleasure vessels, fishing vessels, small passenger vessels on domestic voyages);
<br>
<br>(b) Area of operation (rivers, harbors, bays, sounds, etc.);
<br>
<br>(c) Minimum size (length); and
<br>
<br>(d) Treaty exclusions.
<br>
<br>Clause (1) exempts vessels of war from load line requirements.
<br>
<br>Clause (2) exempts recreational vessels operated only for pleasure from load line requirements.
<br>
<br>Clause (3) exempts fishing vessels from load line requirements.
<br>
<br>Clauses (4) and (5) exempt certain existing fish processing and fish tender vessels not on a foreign voyage from load line requirements. The exception is limited to those vessels not on international voyages to ensure compliance with United States obligations under the International Load Line Convention.
<br>
<br>Clause (6) exempts from load line requirements all U.S. vessels operating on domestic voyages within the Boundary Line, as defined in section 2101 of this title, except vessels operating on the Great Lakes.
<br>
<br>Clause (7) exempts all vessels that are less than 24 meters (79 feet) in length from load line requirements whether on international or domestic voyages.
<br>
<br>Clause (8) exempts from load line requirements those public vessels that are on domestic voyages.
<br>
<br>Clause (9) exempts from load line requirements those vessels which have been excluded from the requirements "by specific action of a treaty of the United States." The only current treaty which excludes vessels from load line requirements is the Convention Between the United States of America and the Dominion of Canada Concerning Load Lines (49 Stat. 2685), which entered into force on August 11, 1934.
<br>
<br>Clause (10) exempts from load line requirements existing U.S. vessels that are under 150 gross tons while engaged on a domestic voyage. This is a grandfather provision, continuing the existing exemption for these vessels. Vessels built after January 1, 1986 must be marked with a load line, however, if they are over 79 feet long and do not qualify for any other exemption.
<br>
<br>Clause (11) exempts small passenger vessels engaged on domestic voyages from load line requirements. Small passenger vessels are inspected under Subchapter T of Title 46 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Under Subchapter T, the Coast Guard regulates these vessels with regard to safety; the requirements are based on the number of passengers, length, and gross tonnage of the vessel. Safety-related requirements in Subchapter T regulations include hull structure and watertightness, stability, weathertight integrity, and safe movement of persons on deck, the principal safety features covered by load line regulations. This specific exemption from load line requirements for small passenger vessels is consistent with existing law and does not alter in any way the Coast Guard's authority to regulate small passenger vessels under Subchapter T.
<br>
<br>Clause (12) exempts vessels of the working voyages from the requirement to have load lines.
<br>
<br>Section 5102(c) authorizes the Secretary to assign load lines for any vessel exempted from load line requirements by subsection (b) upon the request of the owner. It also provides that any exempted vessel for which load lines are assigned will remain subject to the load line requirements until its load line certificate is surrendered and the load line marks are removed.
<br>
<br>Section 5102(d) provides that this chapter shall not be construed as abrogating the provisions of other treaties and conventions to which the United States is a party, which are not in conflict with the International Convention on Load Lines.

L. 101–595 effective Nov. 16, 1990, with provision that before Jan. 1, 2003, a fish tender vessel is exempt from this chapter when engaged in Aleutian trade if the vessel either operated in that trade before Sept. 8, 1990, or was purchased before that date to be used in such trade and entered into service in that trade before June 1, 1992, did not undergo a major conversion, and did not have a load line assigned at any time before Nov. 16, 1990, see section 602(f) of Pub. L. 101–595, set out as a note under section 4502 of this title.
<br>Fish Tender Vessels in Aleutian Trade
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 107–295, title IV, §436(b), (c), Nov. 25, 2002, 116 Stat. 2129, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(b) Implementation.—Except as provided in subsection (c), a fish tender vessel that before January 1, 2003, transported cargo (not including fishery related products) in the Aleutian trade is subject to chapter 51 of title 46, United States Code (as amended by subsection (a) of this section [amending this section]).
<br>
<br>"(c) Exception.—
<br>
<br>"(1) In general.—Before December 31, 2006, the BOWFIN (United States official number 604231) is exempt from chapter 51 of title 46, United States Code (as amended by subsection (a) of this section) when engaged in the Aleutian trade, if the vessel does not undergo a major conversion.
<br>
<br>"(2) Ensuring safety.—Before the date referred to in paragraph (1), a Coast Guard official who has reason to believe that the vessel referred to in paragraph (1) operating under this subsection is in a condition or is operated in a manner that creates an immediate threat to life or the environment or is operated in a manner that is inconsistent with section 3302 of title 46, United States Code, may direct the master or individual in charge to take immediate and reasonable steps to safeguard life and the environment, including directing the vessel to a port or other refuge."
<br>
<br>[For transfer of authorities, functions, personnel, and assets of the Coast Guard, including the authorities and functions of the Secretary of Transportation relating thereto, to the Department of Homeland Security, and for treatment of related references, see sections 468(b), 551(d), 552(d), and 557 of Title 6, Domestic Security, and the Department of Homeland Security Reorganization Plan of November 25, 2002, as modified, set out as a note under section 542 of Title 6.]
<br>§5103. Load line requirements
<br>
<br>(a) A vessel may be operated only if the vessel has been assigned load lines.
<br>
<br>(b) The owner, charterer, managing operator, agent, master, and individual in charge of a vessel shall mark and maintain the load lines permanently and conspicuously in the way prescribed by the Secretary.
<br>
<br>(c) A fishing vessel built on or before July 1, 2013, that undergoes a major conversion completed after the later of July 1, 2013, or the date the Secretary establishes standards for an alternate loadline compliance program, shall comply with such an alternative loadline compliance program that is developed in cooperation with the commercial fishing industry and prescribed by the Secretary.

<br>2012—Subsec. (c). Pub. L. 112–213 substituted "July 1, 2013," for "July 1, 2012," in two places and substituted "major conversion" for "substantial change to the dimension of or type of the vessel".
<br>
<br>2010—Subsec. (c). Pub. L. 111–281 added subsec. (c).
<br>§5104. Assignment of load lines
<br>
<br>(a) The Secretary shall assign load lines for a vessel so that they indicate the minimum safe freeboard to which the vessel may be loaded. However, if the owner requests, the Secretary may assign load lines that result in greater freeboard than the minimum safe freeboard.
<br>
<br>(b) In assigning load lines for a vessel, the Secretary shall consider—
<br>
<br>(1) the service, type, and character of the vessel;
<br>
<br>(2) the geographic area in which the vessel will operate; and
<br>
<br>(3) applicable international agreements to which the United States Government is a party.
<br>
<br>(c) An existing vessel may retain its load lines assigned before January 1, 1986, unless the Secretary decides that a substantial change in the vessel after those load lines were assigned requires that new load lines be assigned under this chapter.
<br>
<br>(d) The minimum freeboard of an existing vessel may be reduced only if the vessel complies with every applicable provision of this chapter.
<br>
<br>(e) The Secretary may designate by regulation specific geographic areas that have less severe weather or sea conditions and from which there is adequate time to return to available safe harbors. The Secretary may reduce the minimum freeboard of a vessel operating in these areas.

<br>
<br>Section 5104(a) requires the Secretary to assign load lines indicating the minimum safe freeboard to which a vessel may be loaded. It also authorizes the Secretary to assign a load line that results in a freeboard that is greater than the minimum freeboard, if the owner requests.
<br>
<br>Section 5104(b) sets forth guidelines that the Secretary must consider when assigning load lines on vessels.
<br>
<br>Section 5104(c) allows an existing vessel to retain its load line assigned before January 1, 1986, unless the Secretary decides that a change made in the vessel requires the assignment of a new load line.
<br>
<br>Section 5104(d) is a new provision that requires that a vessel comply with all the provisions of this chapter before the Secretary will consider a reduction in its minimum freeboard. This provision is similar to Article 4(4) of the International Convention on Load Lines.
<br>
<br>Section 5104(e) is a new provision that authorized the Secretary to designate specific geographic areas having relatively non-severe weather or sea conditions and from which there is adequate time to return to safe harbors. Section 5104(e) also authorizes the Secretary to reduce the minimum freeboard of vessels operating in these areas. Regulations that have been issued under this authority (46 C.F.R. 44) authorize special service load lines for vessels operating not more than 20 nautical miles offshore or between islands in a group.
<br>§5105. Load line surveys
<br>
<br>(a) The Secretary may provide for annual, renewal, and other load line surveys.
<br>
<br>(b) In conducting a load line survey, the Secretary shall consider whether—
<br>
<br>(1) the hull and fittings of the vessel—
<br>
<br>(A) are adequate to protect the vessel from the sea; and
<br>
<br>(B) meet other requirements the Secretary may prescribe by regulation;
<br>
<br>(2) the strength of the hull is adequate for all loading conditions;
<br>
<br>(3) the stability of the vessel is adequate for all loading conditions;
<br>
<br>(4) the topsides of the vessel are arranged and constructed to allow rapid overboard drainage of deck water in heavy weather; and
<br>
<br>(5) the topsides of the vessel are adequate in design, arrangement, and equipment to protect crewmembers performing outside tasks necessary for safe operation of the vessel.

<br>
<br>Section 5105 authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to provide for load line surveys and requires that while conducting a load line survey, the Secretary must consider various strength, stability, design, and construction features of the vessel.
<br>§5106. Load line certificate
<br>
<br>(a) On finding that a load line survey of a vessel under this chapter is satisfactory and that the vessel's load lines are marked correctly, the Secretary shall issue the vessel a load line certificate and deliver it to the owner, master, or individual in charge of the vessel.
<br>
<br>(b) The certificate shall be maintained as required by the Secretary.

<br>
<br>Section 5106(a) requires the Secretary to issue a load line certificate upon finding that a vessel has received a satisfactory load line survey and that the vessel's load line is marked correctly.
<br>
<br>Section 5106(b) requires that the load line certificate be maintained as required by the Secretary of Transportation. It is expected that the Secretary will require in most cases that the certificate be carried on board the vessel. However, certain types of vessels such as barges do not have facilities for the carriage of certificates. In this case, this provision would give the Secretary the discretion to require that the certificates for the barges be carried on the towing vessels.
<br>§5107. Delegation of authority
<br>
<br>(a) The Secretary shall delegate to the American Bureau of Shipping or other similarly qualified organizations the authority to assign load lines, survey vessels, determine that load lines are marked correctly, and issue load line certificates under this chapter.
<br>
<br>(b) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, a decision of an organization delegated authority under subsection (a) of this section related to the assignment of a load line may be appealed to the Secretary.
<br>
<br>(c) For a vessel intended to be engaged on a foreign voyage, the Secretary may delegate to another country that is a party to the International Convention on Load Lines, 1966, the authority to assign load lines, survey vessels, determine that the load lines are marked correctly, and issue an International Load Line Certificate (1966).
<br>
<br>(d) The Secretary may terminate a delegation made under this section after giving written notice to the organization.

<br>
<br>Section 5107(a) requires the Secretary to delegate the performance of various load line functions to the American Bureau of Shipping or other similarly qualified organizations. In providing for the delegation to a "similarly qualified organization," the Committee expects that the Secretary will ensure that that organization complies with the same stringent standards and requirements for conducting business that apply to the American Bureau of Shipping.
<br>
<br>Section 5107(b) permits an appeal to the Secretary of a decision by an organization that has received delegated authority. This ensures that the Secretary has full oversight of the delegated load line functions.
<br>
<br>Section 5107(c) permits the Secretary to delegate various load line functions to another country for vessels that are engaged on a foreign voyage, provided that the country is a party to the International Convention on Load Lines, 1966.
<br>
<br>Section 5107(d) clarifies the Secretary's authority to revoke a delegation at any time without cause. This authority is given so that no delay occurs administratively in revoking a delegation whenever the Secretary decides a revocation is warranted.
<br>§5108. Special exemptions
<br>
<br>(a) The Secretary may exempt a vessel from any part of this chapter when—
<br>
<br>(1) the vessel is entitled to an exemption under an international agreement to which the United States Government is a party; or
<br>
<br>(2) under regulations (including regulations on special operations conditions) prescribed by the Secretary, the Secretary finds that good cause exists for granting an exemption.
<br>
<br>(b) When the Secretary grants an exemption under this section, the Secretary may issue a certificate of exemption stating the extent of the exemption.
<br>
<br>(c) A certificate of exemption issued under subsection (b) of this section shall be maintained as required by the Secretary.

<br>
<br>Section 5108(a) authorizes the Secretary to exempt a vessel from load line requirements if the vessel is entitled to an exemption under an international agreement to which the United States is a party. It also provides the Secretary with the new authority to exempt a vessel from load line requirements if the Secretary finds that there is good reason for granting the exemption. A specific exemption from load line requirements was authorized in Public Law 98–557 for barges operating close to shore between Calumet Harbor, Illinois and Burns Harbor, Indiana, because the geographic area and type of operation in this case did not warrant a requirement for load lines. Additional exemptions currently must be made by an Act of Congress. Section 5108(a) authorizes the Secretary to make such exemptions through regulation, and the Committee expects the Secretary to continue the exemption under this provision for vessels operating close to shore between Calumet Harbor, Illinois and Burns Harbor, Indiana.
<br>
<br>Section 5108(b) authorizes the Secretary to issue a certificate of exemption when an exemption is granted.
<br>
<br>Section 5108(c) requires that the certificate of exemption be maintained as required by the Secretary in a similar manner as under section 5106(b).
<br>§5109. Reciprocity for foreign vessels
<br>
<br>(a) When the Secretary finds that the laws and regulations of a foreign country related to load lines are similar to those of this chapter and the regulations prescribed under this chapter, or when a foreign country is a party to an international load line agreement to which the United States Government is a party, the Secretary shall accept the load line marks and certificate of a vessel of that foreign country as complying with this chapter and the regulations prescribed under this chapter. The Secretary may control the vessel as provided for in the applicable international agreement.
<br>
<br>(b) Subsection (a) of this section does not apply to a vessel of a foreign country that does not recognize load lines assigned under this chapter.

<br>§5110. Submersible vessels
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding sections 5103–5105 of this title, the Secretary may prescribe regulations for submersible vessels to provide a minimum level of safety. In developing the regulations, the Secretary shall consider factors relevant to submersible vessels, including the structure, stability, and watertight integrity of those vessels.

<br>(a) A vessel may not be loaded in a way that submerges the assigned load line or the place at which the load line is required to be marked on the vessel.
<br>
<br>(b) If the loading or stability conditions of a vessel change, the master or individual in charge of the vessel, before moving the vessel, shall record in the official logbook or other permanent record of the vessel—
<br>
<br>(1) the position of the assigned load line relative to the water surface; and
<br>
<br>(2) the draft of the vessel fore and aft.
<br>
<br>(c) A vessel may be operated only if the loading distribution, stability, and margin of strength are adequate for the voyage or movement intended.
<br>

<br>
<br>Section 5112(d) provides that subsections (a) and (b) do not apply to a submersible vessel.
<br>§5113. Detention of vessels
<br>
<br>(a) When the Secretary believes that a vessel is about to leave a place in the United States in violation of this chapter or a regulation prescribed under this chapter, the Secretary may detain the vessel by giving notice to the owner, charterer, managing operator, agent, master, or individual in charge of the vessel.
<br>
<br>(b) A detained vessel may be cleared under section 60105 of this title only after the violation has been corrected. If the vessel was cleared before being detained, the clearance shall be withdrawn.
<br>
<br>(c) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, the owner, charterer, managing operator, agent, master, or individual in charge of a detained vessel may petition the Secretary to review the detention order.
<br>

<br>
<br>(e) A marine casualty not resulting in the death of an individual shall be classified according to the gravity of the casualty, as prescribed by regulation, giving consideration to the extent of injuries to individuals, the extent of property damage, the dangers that the casualty creates, and the size, occupation, and means of propulsion of each vessel involved.
<br>
<br>(f)(1) This chapter applies to a marine casualty involving a United States citizen on a foreign passenger vessel operating south of 75 degrees north latitude, west of 35 degrees west longitude, and east of the International Date Line; or operating in the area south of 60 degrees south latitude that—

<br>
<br>Section 6101(a) requires the Secretary to prescribe regulations on the types and manner of reporting of marine casualties to be reported under subsection (b) and incidents to be reported under subsection (c). The casualties to be reported must include casualties involving death to an individual, serious injury to an individual, material loss of property, and any damage affecting the seaworthiness or efficiency of the vessel, in addition to the other casualties (if any) the Secretary feels should be reported.
<br>
<br>Subsection (b) requires the owner, charterer, agent, master, operator, or individual in charge of a vessel to report within 5 days, any casualty required in subsection (a) or by regulation.
<br>
<br>Subsection (c) requires the owner, charterer, managing operator, or agent of a U.S. vessel to immediately determine the status of their vessel if they have not heard from the vessel, if it has not passed a scheduled point, or for any other reason which may indicate the vessel may have been lost or imperiled. If the owner, charterer, managing operator, or agent cannot reach the vessel and determine that it is operating safely, then they shall immediately notify the Coast Guard and provide the Coast Guard with the name and number of the vessel, the names of individuals on board, and any other information that the Coast Guard may request. If communication with the vessel indicates the vessel was involved in a casualty, then the owner, charterer, or agent of the vessel must immediately notify the Coast Guard under subsection (b). Notification to the Coast Guard does not impose or create any additional responsibility for the Coast Guard to take search and rescue action beyond those already existing under title 14, United States Code.
<br>
<br>Subsection (d) makes it clear that the reporting requirements under subsection (b) are applicable to foreign vessels involved in a marine casualty when operating on the navigable waters of the United States, whether in innocent passage or not.
<br>
<br>Subsection (e) provides for the classification of marine casualties by regulation according to the gravity of the casualty, injuries to individuals, property damage, dangers created, and size, occupation, and means of propulsion of each vessel.

<br>6303 	46:239(d)
<br>
<br>Section 6303 provides for the rights of parties in interest to an investigation by allowing them to be represented by counsel, to cross examine witnesses, and to call witnesses. This section merely states the rights of a party in interest but does not necessarily determine who is to be considered a party in interest. Clause (4) states that these rights are to be afforded to "any other person whose conduct is under investigation" (emphasis added). This implies that clauses (1) through (3) apply to individuals whose conduct is under investigation. If any individual does not qualify for these rights under clauses (1) through (4), that individual can still be entitled to these rights under clause (5), if designated as a party in interest. Since parties in interest are not clearly set out by statute, the Secretary has the authority to do this by regulation under section 6301. Thus the rights of these parties as presently provided for in existing law have been retained.
<br>§6304. Subpena authority
<br>
<br>(a) In an investigation under this chapter, the attendance and testimony of witnesses, including parties in interest, and the production of any evidence may be compelled by subpena.
