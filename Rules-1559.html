<br>§3105. Savings bonds and savings certificates
<br>
<br>(a) With the approval of the President, the Secretary of the Treasury may issue savings bonds and savings certificates of the United States Government and may buy, redeem, and make refunds under section 3111 of this title. Proceeds from the bonds and certificates shall be used for expenditures authorized by law. Savings bonds and certificates may be issued on an interest-bearing basis, on a discount basis, or on an interest-bearing and discount basis. Savings bonds shall mature not more than 20 years from the date of issue. Savings certificates shall mature not more than 10 years from the date of issue. The difference between the price paid and the amount received on redeeming a savings bond or certificate is interest under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.).
<br>
<br>(b)(1) The Secretary may—
<br>
<br>(A) fix the investment yield for savings bonds; and
<br>
<br>(B) change the investment yield on an outstanding savings bond, except that the yield on a bond for the period held may not be decreased below the minimum yield for the period guaranteed on the date of issue.
<br>
<br>(2) The Secretary may prescribe regulations providing that—
<br>
<br>(A) owners of savings bonds may keep the bonds after maturity or after a period beyond maturity during which the bonds have earned interest and continue to earn interest at rates consistent with paragraph (1) of this subsection; and
<br>
<br>(B) savings bonds earning a different rate of interest before the regulations are prescribed shall earn a rate of interest consistent with paragraph (1).
<br>
<br>(c) The Secretary may prescribe for savings bonds and savings certificates issued under this section—
<br>
<br>(1) the form and amount of an issue and series;
<br>
<br>(2) the way in which they will be issued;
<br>
<br>(3) the conditions, including restrictions on transfer, to which they will be subject;
<br>
<br>(4) conditions governing their redemption;
<br>
<br>(5) their sales price and denominations;
<br>
<br>(6) a way to evidence payments for or on account of them and to provide for the exchange of savings certificates for savings bonds; and
<br>
<br>(7) the maximum amount issued in a year that may be held by one person.
<br>
<br>(d) The Secretary may authorize financial institutions to make payments to redeem savings bonds and savings notes. A financial institution may be a paying agent only if the institution—
<br>
<br>(1) is incorporated under the laws of the United States, a State, the District of Columbia, or a territory or possession of the United States;
<br>
<br>(2) in the usual course of business accepts, subject to withdrawal, money for deposit or the purchase of shares;
<br>
<br>(3) is under the supervision of a banking authority of the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated;
<br>
<br>(4) has a regular office to do business; and
<br>
<br>(5) is qualified under regulations prescribed by the Secretary in carrying out this subsection.
<br>
<br>(e)(1) The Secretary may prescribe a way in which a check issued to an individual (except a trust or estate) as a refund for taxes imposed under subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.) may become a series E savings bond. However, a check may become a bond only if the claim for a refund is filed by the last day prescribed by law for filing the return (determined without any extensions) for the taxable year for which the refund is made. The Secretary may prescribe the time and way in which the check becomes a bond.
<br>
<br>(2) A bond issued under this subsection is deemed to be a series E bond issued under this section, except that the bond shall bear an issue date of the first day of the first month beginning after the close of the taxable year for which the bond is issued. The Secretary also may provide that a bond issued to joint payees may be redeemed by either payee alone.

<br>SUBCHAPTER II—ADMINISTRATIVE
<br>§3121. Procedure
<br>
<br>(a) In issuing obligations under sections 3102–3104 of this title, the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe—
<br>
<br>(1) whether an obligation is to be issued on an interest-bearing basis, a discount basis, or an interest-bearing and discount basis;
<br>
<br>(2) regulations on the conditions under which the obligation will be offered for sale, including whether it will be offered for sale on a competitive or other basis;
<br>
<br>(3) the offering price and interest rate;
<br>
<br>(4) the method of computing the interest rate;
<br>
<br>(5) the dates for paying principal and interest;
<br>
<br>(6) the form and denominations of the obligations; and
<br>
<br>(7) other conditions.
<br>
<br>(b)(1) Under conditions prescribed by the Secretary, an obligation issued under this chapter and redeemable on demand of the owner or holder may be used to pay the United States Government for taxes imposed by it.
<br>
<br>(2) An obligation of the Government issued after March 3, 1971, under law may not be redeemed before its maturity to pay a tax imposed by the Government in an amount more than the fair market value of the obligation at the time of its redemption. This paragraph does not apply to a Treasury bill issued under section 3104 of this title.
<br>
<br>(c) Under conditions prescribed by the Secretary, an obligation authorized by this chapter may be issued in exchange for an obligation of an agency whose principal and interest are unconditionally guaranteed by the Government at or before maturity.
<br>
<br>(d) Under conditions prescribed by the Secretary, the Secretary may issue registered bonds in exchange for and instead of coupon bonds that have been or may be issued. The registered bonds shall be similar in all respects to the registered bonds issued under a law authorizing the issue of coupon bonds offered for exchange.
<br>
<br>(e) A decision of the Secretary about an issue of obligations under sections 3102–3104 of this title is final.
<br>
<br>(f) The Secretary may accept voluntary services in carrying out the sale of public debt obligations.
<br>
<br>(g)(1) In this subsection, "registration-required obligation" means an obligation except an obligation—
<br>
<br>(A) not of a type offered to the public; or
<br>
<br>(B) having a maturity (at issue) of not more than one year.
<br>
<br>(2) Every registration-required obligation of the Government shall be in registered form. A book entry obligation is deemed to be in registered form if the right to principal and stated interest on the obligation may be transferred only through a book entry consistent with regulations of the Secretary.
<br>
<br>(3) The Secretary shall prescribe regulations necessary to carry out this subsection when there is a nominee.
<br>
<br>(h)(1) The Secretary shall prescribe by regulation standards for the safeguarding and use of obligations issued under this chapter, and obligations otherwise issued or guaranteed as to principal or interest by the United States. Such regulations shall apply only to a depository institution that is not a government securities broker or a government securities dealer and that holds such obligations as fiduciary, custodian, or otherwise for the account of a customer and not for its own account. Such regulations shall provide for the adequate segregation of obligations so held, including obligations which are purchased or sold subject to resale or repurchase.
<br>
<br>(2) Violation of a regulation prescribed under paragraph (1) shall constitute adequate basis for the issuance of an order under section 5239(a) or (b) of the Revised Statutes (12 U.S.C. 93(a) or (b)), section 8(b) or 8(c) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, section 5(d)(2) or 5(d)(3) 1 of the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933, section 407(e) or 407(f) 1 of the National Housing Act, or section 206(e) or 206(f) of the Federal Credit Union Act. Such an order may be issued with respect to a depository institution by its appropriate regulatory agency and with respect to a federally insured credit union by the National Credit Union Administration Board.
<br>
<br>(3) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to affect in any way the powers of such agencies under any other provision of law.
<br>
<br>(4) The Secretary shall, prior to adopting regulations under this subsection, determine with respect to each appropriate regulatory agency and the National Credit Union Administration Board, whether its rules and standards adequately meet the purposes of regulations to be promulgated under this subsection, and if the Secretary so determines, shall exempt any depository institution subject to such rules or standards from the regulations promulgated under this subsection.
<br>
<br>(5) As used in this subsection—
<br>
<br>(A) "depository institution" has the meaning stated in clauses (i) through (vi) of section 19(b)(1)(A) of the Federal Reserve Act and also includes a foreign bank, an agency or branch of a foreign bank, and a commercial lending company owned or controlled by a foreign bank (as such terms are defined in the International Banking Act of 1978).
<br>
<br>(B) "government securities broker" has the meaning prescribed in section 3(a)(43) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
<br>
<br>(C) "government securities dealer" has the meaning prescribed in section 3(a)(44) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
<br>
<br>(D) "appropriate regulatory agency" has the meaning prescribed in section 3(a)(34)(G) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

In clause (1), the .2 percent limitation on expenses of bonds referred to in 31:760 is made applicable to a "note" because of the definition of bond in 31:753(d)(last sentence). The words "sections 735 to 738, . . . 765, . . . 773 of this title and section 84 of title 12" in 31:753(d)(last sentence) are omitted because they refer to sections previously repealed (31:735–738, 765) or obsolete (31:773, which was superseded by 39:410) and because 12:84 was amended to express the result required by the source provisions by section 10 of the Act of February 25, 1927 (ch. 191, 44 Stat. 1229).
<br>
<br>In subsection (b), the words "appropriation for the specified amount" are substituted for "definite appropriation", and the words "appropriation for an unspecified amount" are substituted for "indefinite appropriation", as being more precise. The word "only" is substituted for "and the indefinite appropriation shall not be available for obligation" to eliminate unnecessary words.
