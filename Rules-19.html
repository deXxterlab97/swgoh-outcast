<br>To approach unto Me? saith the LORD.
<br>22And ye shall be My people, and I will be your God.
<br>
<br>23Behold, a storm of the LORD is gone forth in fury,
<br>A sweeping storm; it shall whirl upon the head of the wicked.
<br>24The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return,
<br>Until He have executed, and till He have performed
<br>The purposes of His heart;
<br>In the end of days ye shall consider it.
<br>At that time, saith the LORD,
<br>Will I be the God of all the families of Israel,
<br> 
<br>And they shall be My people.
<br>
<br>2Thus saith the LORD:
<br>The people that were left of the sword
<br>Have found grace in the wilderness,
<br>Even Israel, when I go to cause him to rest.
<br>3’From afar the LORD appeared unto me.’
<br>’Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love;
<br>Therefore with affection have I drawn thee.
<br>4Again will I build thee, and thou shalt be built,
<br>O virgin of Israel;
<br>Again shalt thou be adorned with thy tabrets,
<br>And shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry.
<br>5Again shalt thou plant vineyards upon the mountains of Samaria;
<br>The planters shall plant, and shall have the use thereof.
<br>6For there shall be a day,
<br>That the watchmen shall call upon the mount Ephraim:
<br>Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion, Unto the LORD our God.’
<br>
<br>7For thus saith the LORD:
<br>Sing with gladness for Jacob,
<br>And shout at the head of the nations; Announce ye, praise ye, and say:
<br>‘O LORD, save Thy people, The remnant of Israel.’
<br>8Behold, I will bring them from the north country,
<br> 
<br>And gather them from the uttermost parts of the earth,
<br>And with them the blind and the lame,
<br>The woman with child and her that travaileth with child together;
<br>A great company shall they return hither.
<br>9They shall come with weeping,
<br>And with supplications will I lead them;
<br>I will cause them to walk by rivers of waters,
<br>In a straight way wherein they shall not stumble;
<br>For I am become a father to Israel, And Ephraim is My first-born.
<br>
<br>10Hear the word of the LORD, O ye nations,
<br>And declare it in the isles afar off, and say:
<br>‘He that scattered Israel doth gather him,
<br>And keep him, as a shepherd doth his flock.’
<br>11For the LORD hath ransomed Jacob,
<br>And He redeemeth him from the hand of him that is stronger than he.
<br>12And they shall come and sing in the height of Zion,
<br>And shall flow unto the goodness of the LORD,
<br>To the corn, and to the wine, and to the oil,
<br>And to the young of the flock and of the herd;
<br> 
<br>And their soul shall be as a watered garden,
<br>And they shall not pine any more at all.
<br>13Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance,
<br>And the young men and the old together;
<br>For I will turn their mourning into joy,
<br>And will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow. 14And I will satiate the soul of the
<br>priests with fatness,
<br>And My people shall be satisfied with My goodness,
<br>Saith the LORD.
<br>
<br>15Thus saith the LORD:
<br>A voice is heard in Ramah, Lamentation, and bitter weeping, Rachel weeping for her children;
<br>She refuseth to be comforted for her children,
<br>Because they are not.
<br>
<br>16Thus saith the LORD:
<br>Refrain thy voice from weeping, And thine eyes from tears;
<br>For thy work shall be rewarded, saith the LORD;
<br>And they shall come back from the land of the enemy.
<br>17And there is hope for thy future, saith the LORD;
<br>And thy children shall return to their own border.
<br>18I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself:
<br> 
<br>‘Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised,
<br>As a calf untrained;
<br>Turn thou me, and I shall be turned, For Thou art the LORD my God.
<br>19Surely after that I was turned, I repented,
<br>And after that I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh;
<br>I was ashamed, yea, even confounded,
<br>Because I did bear the reproach of my youth.’
<br>20Is Ephraim a darling son unto Me? Is he a child that is dandled?
<br>For as often as I speak of him,
<br>I do earnestly remember him still;
<br>Therefore My heart yearneth for him,
<br>I will surely have compassion upon him, saith the LORD.
<br>
<br>21Set thee up waymarks, Make thee guide-posts;
<br>Set thy heart toward the high-way,
<br>Even the way by which thou wentest;
<br>Return, O virgin of Israel, Return to these thy cities. 22How long wilt thou turn away
<br>coyly,
<br>O thou backsliding daughter?
<br>For the LORD hath created a new thing in the earth:
<br>A woman shall court a man.
<br>
<br>23Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel:
<br>Yet again shall they use this speech
<br> 
<br>In the land of Judah and in the cities thereof,
<br>When I shall turn their captivity: ‘The LORD bless thee, O habitation
<br>of righteousness,
<br>O mountain of holiness.’
<br>24And Judah and all the cities thereof
<br>Shall dwell therein together:
<br>The husbandmen, and they that go forth with flocks.
<br>25For I have satiated the weary soul,
<br>And every pining soul have I replenished.
<br>
<br>26Upon this I awaked, and beheld; And my sleep was sweet unto me.
<br>
<br>27Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast. 28And it shall come to pass, that like as I have watched over them to pluck up and to break down, and to overthrow and to destroy, and to afflict; so will I watch over them to build and to plant, saith the LORD.
<br>29In those days they shall say no more:
<br>‘The fathers have eaten sour grapes,
<br>And the children’s teeth are set on edge.’
<br>30But every one shall die for his own iniquity; every man that eateth the sour grapes, his teeth shall be set on edge.
<br>31Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the
<br> 
<br>house of Judah; 32not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; forasmuch as they broke My covenant, although I was a lord over them, saith the LORD. 33But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the LORD, I will put My law in their inward parts, and in their heart will I write it; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people; 34and they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying: ‘Know the LORD’; for they shall all know Me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the LORD; for I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin will I remember no more.
<br>
<br>35Thus saith the LORD,
<br>Who giveth the sun for a light by day,
<br>And the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night,
<br>Who stirreth up the sea, that the waves thereof roar,
<br>The LORD of hosts is His name:
<br>36If these ordinances depart from before Me,
<br>Saith the LORD,
<br>Then the seed of Israel also shall cease
<br>From being a nation before Me for ever.
<br>
<br>37Thus saith the LORD:
<br>If heaven above can be measured,
<br> 
<br>And the foundations of the earth searched out beneath,
<br>Then will I also cast off all the seed of Israel
<br>For all that they have done, saith the LORD.
<br>38Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the city shall be built to the LORD from the tower of Hananel unto the gate of the corner. 39And the measuring line shall yet go out straight forward unto the hill Gareb, and shall turn about unto Goah. 40And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and all the fields unto the brook Kidron, unto the corner of the horse gate toward the east, shall be holy unto the LORD; it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more for ever.
<br>
<br>The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the
<br>tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar. 2Now at that time the king of Babylon’s army was besieging Jerusalem; and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard, which was in the king of Judah’s house. 3For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying: ‘Wherefore dost thou prophesy, and say: Thus saith the LORD: Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it; 4and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of
<br> 
<br>Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes; 5and he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I remember him, saith the LORD; though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper?’
<br>6And Jeremiah said: ‘The word of the LORD came unto me, saying: 7Behold, Hanamel, the son of Shallum thine uncle, shall come unto thee, saying: Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth; for the right of redemption is thine to buy it.’ 8So Hanamel mine uncle’s son came to me in the court of the guard according to the word of the LORD, and said unto me: ‘Buy my field, I pray thee, that is in Anathoth, which is in the land of Benjamin; for the right of inheritance is thine, and the redemption is thine; buy it for thyself.’ Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD. 9And I bought the field that was in Anathoth of Hanamel mine uncle’s son, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver. 10And I subscribed the deed, and sealed it, and called witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances. 11So I took the deed of the purchase, both that which was sealed, containing the terms and conditions, and that which was open; 12and I delivered the deed of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel mine uncle[‘s son], and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the deed of the purchase,
<br> 
<br>before all the Jews that sat in the court of the guard. 13And I charged Baruch before them, saying: 14’Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these deeds, this deed of the purchase, both that which is sealed, and this deed which is open, and put them in an earthen vessel; that they may continue many days. 15For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards shall yet again be bought in this land.’
<br>16Now after I had delivered the deed of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto the LORD, saying: 17’Ah Lord GOD! behold, Thou hast made the heaven and the earth by Thy great power and by Thy outstretched arm; there is nothing too hard for Thee; 18who showest mercy unto thousands, and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them; the great, the mighty God, the LORD of hosts is His name; 19great in counsel, and mighty in work; whose eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men, to give every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings; 20who didst set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even unto this day, and in Israel and among other men; and madest Thee a name, as at this day; 21and didst bring forth Thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terror; 22and gavest them this land, which
<br> 
<br>Thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey; 23and they came in, and possessed it; but they hearkened not to Thy voice, neither walked in Thy law; they have done nothing of all that Thou commandedst them to do; therefore Thou hast caused all this evil to befall them; 24behold the mounds, they are come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans that fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence; and what Thou hast spoken is come to pass; and, behold, Thou seest it. 25Yet Thou hast said unto me, O Lord GOD: Buy thee the field for money, and call witnesses; whereas the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.’
<br>26Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying: 27’Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh; is there any thing too hard for Me? 28Therefore thus saith the LORD: Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it; 29and the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set this city on fire, and burn it, with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered unto Baal, and poured out drink-offerings unto other gods, to provoke Me. 30For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done that which was evil in My sight from their youth; for the children of Israel have only
<br> 
<br>provoked Me with the work of their hands, saith the LORD. 31For this city hath been to Me a provocation of Mine anger and of My fury from the day that they built it even unto this day, that I should remove it from before My face; 32because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke Me, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 33And they have turned unto Me the back, and not the face; and though I taught them, teaching them betimes and often, yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction. 34But they set their abominations in the house whereupon My name is called, to defile it. 35And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to set apart their sons and their daughters unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into My mind, that they should do this abomination; to cause Judah to sin. 36And now therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city, whereof ye say: It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence: 37Behold, I will gather them out of all the countries, whither I have driven them in Mine anger, and in My fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them back unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely; 38and they shall be My people, and I will be their God; 39and I
<br> 
<br>will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear Me for ever; for the good of them, and of their children after them; 40and I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; and I will put My fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from Me. 41Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land in truth with My whole heart and with My whole soul. 42For thus saith the LORD: Like as I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised them. 43And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say: It is desolate, without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans. 44Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe the deeds, and seal them, and call witnesses, in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the hill-country, and in the cities of the Lowland, and in the cities of the South; for I will cause their captivity to return, saith the LORD.’
<br>Moreover the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the
<br>second time, while he was yet shut up in the court of the guard, saying:
<br>2Thus saith the LORD the Maker thereof,
<br>The LORD that formed it to establish it,
<br>The LORD is His name:
<br> 
<br>3Call unto Me, and I will answer thee,
<br>And will tell thee great things, and hidden, which thou knowest not.
<br>4For thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are broken down for mounds, and for ramparts; 5whereon they come to fight with the Chaldeans, even to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in Mine anger and in My fury, and for all whose wickedness I have hid My face from this city: 6Behold, I will bring it healing and cure, and I will cure them; and I will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth. 7And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first. 8And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against Me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned against Me, and whereby they have transgressed against Me. 9And this city shall be to Me for a name of joy, for a praise and for a glory, before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do unto them, and shall fear and tremble for all the good and for all the peace that I procure unto it.
<br>10Thus saith the LORD: Yet again there shall be heard in this place, whereof ye say: It is waste, without man and without beast, even in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of
<br> 
<br>Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man and without inhabitant and without beast, 11the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that say: ‘Give thanks to the LORD of hosts, for the LORD is good, for His mercy endureth for ever’, even of them that bring offerings of thanksgiving into the house of the LORD. For I will cause the captivity of the land to return as at the first, saith the LORD.
<br>12Thus saith the LORD of hosts: Yet again shall there be in this place, which is waste, without man and without beast, and in all the cities thereof, a habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down. 13In the cities of the hill-country, in the cities of the Lowland, and in the cities of the South, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks again pass under the hands of him that counteth them, saith the LORD.
<br>14Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will perform that good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah. 15In those days, and at that time,
<br>Will I cause a shoot of righteousness to grow up unto David;
<br>And he shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.
<br>16In those days shall Judah be saved, And Jerusalem shall dwell safely;
<br> 
<br>And this is the name whereby she shall be called,
<br>The LORD is our righteousness.
<br>17For thus saith the LORD: There shall not be cut off unto David a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel; 18neither shall there be cut off unto the priests the Levites a man before Me to offer burnt-offerings, and to burn meal-offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.
<br>19And the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, saying: 20Thus saith the LORD:
<br>If ye can break My covenant with the day,
<br>And My covenant with the night,
<br>So that there should not be day and night in their season;
<br>21Then may also My covenant be broken with David My servant,
<br>That he should not have a son to reign upon his throne;
<br>And with the Levites the priests, My ministers.
<br>22As the host of heaven cannot be numbered,
<br>Neither the sand of the sea measured;
<br>So will I multiply the seed of David My servant,
<br>And the Levites that minister unto Me.
<br>23And the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying: 24’Considerest thou not what this people have spoken, saying: The two families which the LORD did choose, He hath cast them off? and they contemn My people, that
<br> 
<br>they should be no more a nation before them. 25Thus saith the LORD: If My covenant be not with day and night, if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth; 26then will I also cast away the seed of Jacob, and of David My servant, so that I will not take of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; for I will cause their captivity to return, and will have compassion on them.’
<br>
<br>The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the land of his dominion, and all the peoples, fought against Jerusalem, and
<br>against all the cities thereof, saying:
<br>2Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: Go, and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him: Thus saith the LORD: Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire; 3and thou shalt not escape out of his hand, but shalt surely be taken, and delivered into his hand; and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon. 4Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah: Thus saith the LORD concerning thee: Thou shalt not die by the sword; 5thou shalt die in peace; and with the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings that were before thee, so shall they make a burning for thee; and they shall lament
<br> 
<br>thee: ‘Ah lord! ’ for I have spoken the word, saith the LORD.
<br>6Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words unto Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem, 7when the king of Babylon’s army fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish and against Azekah; for these alone remained of the cities of Judah as fortified cities.
<br>8The word that came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people that were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty unto them; 9that every man should let his manservant, and every man his maidservant, being a Hebrew man or a Hebrew woman, go free; that none should make bondmen of them, even of a Jew his brother; 10and all the princes and all the people hearkened, that had entered into the covenant to let every one his man- servant, and every one his maid- servant, go free, and not to make bondmen of them any more; they hearkened, and let them go; 11but afterwards they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids; 12therefore the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying:
<br>13Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of
<br> 
<br>the house of bondage, saying: 14’At the end of seven years ye shall let go every man his brother that is a Hebrew, that hath been sold unto thee, and hath served thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from thee’; but your fathers hearkened not unto Me, neither inclined their ear. 15And ye were now turned, and had done that which is right in Mine eyes, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour; and ye had made a covenant before Me in the house whereon My name is called; 16but ye turned and profaned My name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom ye had let go free at their pleasure, to return; and ye brought them into subjection, to be unto you for servants and for handmaids. 17Therefore thus saith the LORD: Ye have not hearkened unto Me, to proclaim liberty, every man to his brother, and every man to his neighbour; behold, I proclaim for you a liberty, saith the LORD, unto the sword, unto the pestilence, and unto the famine; and I will make you a horror unto all the kingdoms of the earth. 18And I will give the men that have transgressed My covenant, that have not performed the words of the covenant which they made before Me, when they cut the calf in twain and passed between the parts thereof; 19the princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the officers, and the priests, and all the people of the land, that passed between the parts of the calf;
<br> 
<br>20I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life; and their dead bodies shall be for food unto the fowls of the heaven, and to the beasts of the earth. 21And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon’s army, that are gone up from you. 22Behold, I will command, saith the LORD, and cause them to return to this city; and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire; and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant.
<br>The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD in the
<br>days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying: 2’Go unto the house of the Rechabites, and speak unto them, and bring them into the house of the LORD, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.’ 3Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites; 4and I brought them into the house of the LORD, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah, the man of God, which was by the chamber of the princes, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the door; 5and I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites goblets full of wine, and cups, and I said unto them: ‘Drink ye
<br> 
<br>wine.’ 6But they said: ‘We will drink no wine; for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father commanded us, saying: Ye shall drink no wine, neither ye, nor your sons, for ever; 7neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have any; but all your days ye shall dwell in tents, that ye may live many days in the land wherein ye sojourn. 8And we have hearkened to the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in all that he charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters; 9nor to build houses for us to dwell in, neither to have vineyard, or field, or seed; 10but we have dwelt in tents, and have hearkened, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us. 11But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up against the land, that we said: Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Arameans; so we dwell at Jerusalem.’
<br>12Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying: 13’Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Go, and say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: Will ye not receive instruction to hearken to My words? saith the LORD. 14The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons, not to drink wine, are performed, and unto this day they drink none, for they hearken to their father’s commandment; but I have spoken unto
<br> 
<br>you, speaking betimes and often, and ye have not hearkened unto Me. 15I have sent also unto you all My servants the prophets, sending them betimes and often, saying: Return ye now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers; but ye have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened unto Me. 16Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father which he commanded them, but this people hath not hearkened unto Me; 17therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them; because I have spoken unto them, but they have not heard, and I have called unto them, but they have not answered.’
<br>18And unto the house of the Rechabites Jeremiah said: Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Because ye have hearkened to the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according unto all that he commanded you; 19therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: There shall not be cut off unto Jonadab the son of Rechab a man to stand before Me for ever.’
<br> 
<br>And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the
<br>son of Josiah, king of Judah, that this word came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, saying: 2’Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spoke unto thee, from the days of Josiah, even unto this day. 3It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them; that they may return every man from his evil way, and I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.’
<br>4Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah; and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD, which He had spoken unto him, upon a roll of a book. 5And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying: ‘I am detained, I cannot go into the house of the LORD; 6therefore go thou, and read in the roll, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of the LORD in the ears of the people in the LORD’S house upon a fast-day; and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of their cities. 7It may be they will present their supplication before the LORD, and will return every one from his evil way; for great is the anger and the fury that the LORD hath pronounced against this people.’ 8And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him,
<br> 
<br>reading in the book the words of the LORD in the LORD’S house.
<br>9Now it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a fast before the LORD, all the people in Jerusalem, and all the people that came from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem. 10Then did Baruch read in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the upper court, at the entry of the new gate of the LORD’S house, in the ears of all the people. 11And when Micaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of the LORD, 12he went down into the king’s house, into the scribe’s chamber; and, lo, all the princes sat there, even Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes. 13Then Micaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people. 14Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying: ‘Take in thy hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come.’ So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came unto them. 15And they said unto him: ‘Sit down now, and read it in our ears.’
<br> 
<br>So Baruch read it in their ears. 16Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they turned in fear one toward another, and said unto Baruch: ‘We will surely tell the king of all these words.’ 17And they asked Baruch, saying: ‘Tell us now: How didst thou write all these words at his mouth?’ 18Then Baruch answered them: ‘He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.’ 19Then said the princes unto Baruch: ‘Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah, and let no man know where ye are.’ 20And they went in to the king into the court; but they had deposited the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe; and they told all the words in the ears of the king. 21So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll; and he took it out of the chamber of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes that stood beside the king. 22Now the king was sitting in the winter-house in the ninth month; and the brazier was burning before him. 23And it came to pass, when Jehudi had read three or four columns, that he cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was in the brazier, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier. 24Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words. 25Moreover Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had entreated the king not to burn the roll; but he
<br> 
<br>would not hear them. 26And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king’s son, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet; but the LORD hid them.
<br>27Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying: 28’Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned. 29And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah thou shalt say: Thus saith the LORD: Thou hast burned this roll, saying: Why hast thou written therein, saying: The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast? 30Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David; and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost. 31And I will visit upon him and his seed and his servants their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them, but they hearkened not.’
<br>32Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of
<br> 
<br>the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire; and there were added besides unto them many like words.
<br>
<br>And Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned as king, instead
<br>of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah. 2But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did hearken unto the words of the LORD, which He spoke by the prophet Jeremiah.
<br>3And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, to the prophet Jeremiah, saying: ‘Pray now unto the LORD our God for us.’ 4Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people; for they had not put him into prison. 5And Pharaoh’s army was come forth out of Egypt; and when the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they broke up from Jerusalem. 6Then came the word of the LORD unto the prophet Jeremiah, saying: 7’Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah, that sent you unto Me to inquire of Me: Behold, Pharaoh’s army, which is come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land. 8And the Chaldeans shall return, and fight against this city; and they shall take it, and burn it with fire. 9Thus saith the LORD: Deceive not yourselves, saying: The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us; for they
<br> 
<br>shall not depart. 10For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among them, yet would they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire.’
<br>11And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh’s army, 12then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to receive his portion there, in the midst of the people. 13And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he laid hold on Jeremiah the prophet, saying: ‘Thou fallest away to the Chaldeans.’ 14Then said Jeremiah: ‘It is false; I fall not away to the Chaldeans’; but he hearkened not to him; so Irijah laid hold on Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes. 15And the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe; for they had made that the prison.
<br>16When Jeremiah was come into the dungeon-house, and into the cells, and Jeremiah had remained there many days; 17then Zedekiah the king sent, and fetched him; and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said: ‘Is there any word from the LORD?’ And Jeremiah said: ‘There is.’ He said also: ‘Thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the  king of Babylon.’ 18Moreover
<br> 
<br>Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah: ‘Wherein have I sinned against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in prison? 19Where now are your prophets that prophesied unto you, saying: The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land? 20And now hear, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray thee, be presented before thee; that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.’ 21Then Zedekiah the king commanded, and they committed Jeremiah into the court of the guard, and they gave him daily a loaf of bread out of the bakers’street, until all the bread in the city was spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.
<br>And Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son
<br>of Pashhur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah spoke unto all the people, saying: 2’Thus saith the LORD: He that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live, and his life shall be unto him for a prey, and he shall live. 3Thus saith the LORD: This city shall surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it.’ 4Then the princes said unto the king: ‘Let this man, we pray thee, be put to death; forasmuch as he weakeneth the hands of the men
<br> 
<br>of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words unto them; for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the hurt.’ 5Then Zedekiah the king said: ‘Behold, he is in your hand; for the king is not he that can do any thing against you.’ 6Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the pit of Malchiah the king’s son, that was in the court of the guard; and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the pit there was no water, but mire; and Jeremiah sank in the mire.
<br>7Now when Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, an officer, who was in the king’s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the pit; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin; 8Ebed- melech went forth out of the king’s house, and spoke to the king, saying: 9’My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the pit; and he is like to die in the place where he is because of the famine; for there is no more bread in the city.’ 10Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying: ‘Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the pit, before he die.’ 11So Ebed- melech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence worn clouts and worn rags, and let them down by cords into the pit to Jeremiah. 12And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah: ‘Put now these worn
<br> 
<br>clouts and rags under thine armholes under the cords.’ And Jeremiah did so. 13So they drew up Jeremiah with the cords, and took him up out of the pit; and Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.
<br>14Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that was in the house of the LORD; and the king said unto Jeremiah: ‘I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing from me.’ 15Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah: ‘If I declare it unto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, thou wilt not hearken unto me.’ 16So Zedekiah the king swore secretly unto Jeremiah, saying: ‘As the LORD liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life.’
<br>17Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah: ‘Thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: If thou wilt go forth unto the king of Babylon’s princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, thou, and thy house; 18but if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon’s princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand.’ 19And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah: ‘I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen away to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.’ 20But
<br> 
<br>Jeremiah said: ‘They shall not deliver thee. Hearken, I beseech thee, to the voice of the LORD, in that which I speak unto thee; so it shall be well with thee, and thy soul shall live. 21But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that the LORD hath shown me: 22Behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah’s house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon’s princes, and those women shall say:
<br>Thy familiar friends have set thee on,
<br>And have prevailed over thee; Thy feet are sunk in the mire, And they are turned away back.
<br>23And they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans; and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon; and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire.’
<br>24Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah: ‘Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die. 25But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come unto thee, and say unto thee: Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king; hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what the king said unto thee; 26then thou shalt say unto them: I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan’s house, to die there.’ 27Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him; and he told them according to all these words
<br> 
<br>that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not reported. 28So Jeremiah abode in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken.
<br>And it came to pass, when Jerusalem was taken—1in the ninth year of Zedekiah king of
<br>Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and besieged it; 2in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, a breach was made in the city— 3that all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, even Nergal- sarezer,     Samgar-nebo,     Sarsechim
<br>aRab-saris, Nergal-sarezer aRab-mag,
<br>with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon. 4And it came to pass, that when Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king’s garden, by the gate betwixt the two walls; and he went out the way of the Arabah. 5But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he gave judgment upon him. 6Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes;
<br>
<br>a Titles of officers.
<br> 
<br>also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah. 7Moreover he put out Zedekiah’s eyes, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon. 8And the Chaldeans burned the king’s house, and the house of the people, with fire, and broke down the walls of Jerusalem. 9Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, the deserters also, that fell away to him, with the rest of the people that remained. 10But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, that had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields in that day. 11Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying: 12’Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee.’ 13So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushazban Rab- saris, and Nergal-sarezer Rab-mag, and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon; 14they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guard, and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home; so he dwelt among the people.
<br>15Now the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the guard, saying: 16’Go, and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying: Thus saith the LORD
<br> 
<br>of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring My words upon this city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be accomplished before thee in that day. 17But I will deliver thee in that day, saith the LORD; and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid. 18For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword, but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee; because thou hast put thy trust in Me, saith the LORD.’
<br>
<br>The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after
<br>that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah, that were carried away captive unto Babylon. 2And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him: ‘The LORD thy God pronounced this evil upon this place; 3and the LORD hath brought it, and done according as He spoke; because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not hearkened to His voice, therefore this thing is come upon you. 4And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which are upon thy hand. If it seem good unto thee to come with me into Babylon, come, and I will look well unto thee; but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into Babylon, forbear; behold, all the land is before thee; whither it seemeth good and right unto thee to go, thither go.—5Yet he would not go back.—Go
<br> 
<br>back then to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon hath made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people; or go wheresoever it seemeth right unto thee to go.’ So the captain of the guard gave him an allowance and a present, and let him go. 6Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah, and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land.
<br>7Now when all the captains of the forces that were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed unto him men, and women, and children, and of the poorest of the land, of them that were not carried away captive to Babylon; 8then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men. 9And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan swore unto them and to their men, saying: ‘Fear not to serve the Chaldeans; dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you. 10As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to stand before the Chaldeans that may come unto us; but ye, gather ye wine and summer fruits and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in
<br> 
<br>your cities that ye have taken.’ 11Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the children of Ammon, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan; 12then all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits in great abundance.
<br>13Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, 14and said unto him: ‘Dost thou know that Baalis the king of the children of Ammon hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take thy life?’ But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not. 15Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying: ‘Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it; wherefore should he take thy life, that all the Jews that are gathered unto thee should be scattered, and the remnant of Judah perish?’ 16But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of Kareah: ‘Thou shalt not do this thing; for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael.’
<br>Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael
<br>the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and one of
<br> 
<br>the chief officers of the king, and ten men with him, came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah. 2Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land. 3Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, even with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there, even the men of war.
<br>4And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man knew it, 5that there came certain men from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even fourscore men, having their beards shaven and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with meal-offerings and frankincense in their hand to bring them to the house of the LORD. 6And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went; and it came to pass, as he met them, he said unto them: ‘Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.’ 7And it was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, and cast them into the midst of the pit, he, and the men that were with him. 8But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael: ‘Slay us not; for we have stores hidden in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of
<br> 
<br>oil, and of honey.’ So he forbore, and slew them not among their brethren. 9Now the pit wherein Ishmael cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had slain by the side of Gedaliah was that which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasa king of Israel; the same Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled with them that were slain. 10Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were in Mizpah, even the king’s daughters, and all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam; Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the children of Ammon.
<br>11But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done, 12then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon. 13Now it came to pass, that when all the people that were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, then they were glad. 14So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah cast about and returned, and went unto Johanan the son of Kareah. 15But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the children of Ammon.
<br> 
<br>16Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after that he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the men, even the men of war, and the women, and the children, and the officers, whom he had brought back from Gibeon; 17and they departed, and dwelt in Geruth Chimham, which is by Beth-lehem, to go to enter into Egypt, 18because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor over the land.
<br>Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even unto the greatest, came near, 2and said unto Jeremiah the prophet: ‘Let, we pray thee, our supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the LORD thy God, even for all this remnant; for we are left but a few of many, as thine eyes do behold us; 3that the LORD thy God may tell us the way wherein we should walk, and the thing that we should do.’ 4Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them: ‘I have heard you; behold, I will pray unto the LORD your God according to your words; and it shall come to pass, that whatsoever thing the LORD shall answer you, I will declare it unto you;
<br> 
<br>I will keep nothing back from you.’ 5Then they said to Jeremiah: ‘The LORD be a true and faithful witness against us, if we do not even according to all the word wherewith the LORD thy God shall send thee to us. 6Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will hearken to the voice of the LORD our God, to whom we send thee; that it may be well with us, when we hearken to the voice of the LORD our God.’
<br>7And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah. 8Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest, 9and said unto them: ‘Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before Him: 10If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up; for I repent Me of the evil that I have done unto you. 11Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid; be not afraid of him, saith the LORD; for I am with you to save you, and to deliver you from his hand. 12And I will grant you compassion, that he may have compassion upon you, and cause you to return to your own land. 13But if ye say: We will not abide in this land; so that ye hearken not to the voice of the LORD your God; 14saying: No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the horn, nor have hunger
<br> 
<br>of bread; and there will we abide; 15now therefore hear ye the word of the LORD, O remnant of Judah: Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: If ye wholly set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there; 16then it shall come to pass, that the sword, which ye fear, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine, whereof ye are afraid, shall follow hard after you there in Egypt; and there ye shall die. 17So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there; they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them. 18For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: As Mine anger and My fury hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so shall My fury be poured forth upon you, when ye shall enter into Egypt; and ye shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and ye shall see this place no more. 19The LORD hath spoken concerning you, O remnant of Judah: Go ye not into Egypt; know certainly that I have forewarned you this day. 20For ye have dealt deceitfully against your own souls; for ye sent me unto the LORD your God, saying: Pray for us unto the LORD our God; and according unto all that the LORD our God shall say, so declare unto us, and we will do it; 21and I have this day declared it to you; but ye have
<br> 
<br>not hearkened to the voice of the LORD your God in any thing for which He hath sent me unto you. 22Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place whither ye desire to go to sojourn there.’
<br>And it came to pass, that when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words		of	the	LORD		their	God, wherewith the LORD their God had sent him to them, even all these words, 2then	spoke		Azariah	the	son	of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah: ‘Thou speakest falsely; the LORD our God hath not sent thee to say: Ye shall not go into Egypt to sojourn there; 3but Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us, to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they may put us to death, and carry us away captives to Babylon.’ 4So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, hearkened not to the voice of the LORD, to dwell in the land of Judah. 5But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from all the nations whither they had been driven to sojourn in the land of Judah: 6the men, and the women, and the children, and the king’s daughters, and every person that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan,
<br> 
<br>and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah; 7and they came into the land of Egypt; for they hearkened not to the voice of the LORD; and they came even to Tahpanhes.
<br>8Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying: 9’Take great stones in thy hand, and hide them in the mortar in the framework, which is at the entry of Pharaoh’s house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah; 10and say unto them: Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, My servant, and will set his throne upon these stones that I have hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them. 11And he shall come, and shall smite the land of Egypt; such as are for death to death, and such as are for captivity to captivity, and such as are for the sword to the sword. 12And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captives; and he shall fold up the land of Egypt, as a shepherd foldeth up his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace. 13He shall also break the pillars of Beth-shemesh, that is in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of Egypt shall he burn with fire.’
<br>
<br>The	word	that	came	to Jeremiah concerning all the
<br>Jews that dwelt in the land of Egypt, that	dwelt	at	Migdol,	and	at
<br> 
<br>Tahpanhes, and at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying: 2’Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Ye have seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Judah; and, behold, this day they are a desolation, and no man dwelleth therein; 3because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke Me, in that they went to offer, and to serve other gods, whom they knew not, neither they, nor ye, nor your fathers. 4Howbeit I sent unto you all My servants the prophets, sending them betimes and often, saying: Oh, do not this abominable thing that I hate. 5But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to forbear offering unto other gods. 6Wherefore My fury and Mine anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted and desolate, as at this day. 7Therefore now thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: Wherefore commit ye this great evil against your own souls, to cut off from you man and woman, infant and suckling, out of the midst of Judah, to leave you none remaining; 8in that ye provoke Me with the works of your hands, offering unto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye are gone to sojourn; that ye may be cut off, and that ye may be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth? 9Have ye forgotten the wicked deeds of your fathers, and the wicked deeds
<br> 
<br>of the kings of Judah, and the wicked deeds of their wives, and your own wicked deeds, and the wicked deeds of your wives, which they committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem? 10They are not humbled even unto this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in My law, nor in My statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers. 11Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will set My face against you for evil, even to cut off all Judah. 12And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed; in the land of Egypt shall they fall; they shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine; they shall die, from the least even unto the greatest, by the sword and by the famine; and they shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach. 13For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; 14so that none of the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, that they should return into the land of Judah, to which they have a desire to return to dwell there; for none shall return save such as shall escape.’
<br>15Then all the men who knew that their wives offered unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great assembly, even all the people
<br> 
<br>that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying: 16’As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the LORD, we will not hearken unto thee. 17But we will certainly perform every word that is gone forth out of our mouth, to offer unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink- offerings unto her, as we have done, we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem; for then had we plenty of food, and were well, and saw no evil. 18But since we let off to offer to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings unto her, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine. 19And is it we that offer to the queen of heaven, and pour out drink- offerings unto her? did we make her cakes in her image, and pour out drink-offerings unto her, without our husbands?’
<br>20Then Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the women, even to all the people that had given him that answer, saying: 21’The offering that ye offered in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye and your fathers, your kings and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the LORD remember them, and came it not into His mind? 22So that the LORD could no longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which ye have committed; therefore is your land
<br> 
<br>become a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this day. 23Because ye have offered, and because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not hearkened to the voice of the LORD, nor walked in His law, nor in His statutes, nor in His testimonies; therefore this evil is happened unto you, as at this day.’
<br>24Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the women: ‘Hear the word of the LORD, all Judah that are in the land of Egypt: 25Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying: Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and with your hands have fulfilled it, saying: We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to offer to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings unto her; ye shall surely establish your vows, and surely perform your vows. 26Therefore hear ye the word of the LORD, all Judah that dwell in the land of Egypt: Behold, I have sworn by My great name, saith the LORD, that My name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt saying: As the Lord GOD liveth. 27Behold, I watch over them for evil, and not for good; and all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end of them. 28And they that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, few in number; and all the
<br> 
<br>remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose word shall stand, Mine, or theirs. 29And this shall be the sign unto you, saith the LORD, that I will punish you in this place, that ye may know that My words shall surely stand against you for evil; 30thus saith the LORD: Behold, I will give Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, his enemy, and that sought his life.’
<br>
<br>The word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke unto Baruch the
<br>son of Neriah, when he wrote these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying: 2’Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning thee, O Baruch: Thou didst say:
<br>3Woe is me now!
<br>For the LORD hath added sorrow to my pain;
<br>I am weary with my groaning, And I find no rest.
<br>4Thus shalt thou say unto him: Thus saith the LORD:
<br>Behold, that which I have built will I break down,
<br>And that which I have planted I will pluck up;
<br>And this in the whole land.
<br>5And seekest thou great things for thyself?
<br> 
<br>Seek them not;
<br>for, behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the LORD; but thy life will I give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou goest.’
<br>
<br>The word of the LORD which came to Jeremiah the prophet
<br>concerning the nations.
<br>2Of Egypt: concerning the army of Pharaoh-neco king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah.
<br>3Make ready buckler and shield, And draw near to battle.
<br>4Harness the horses, and mount, ye horsemen,
<br>And stand forth with your helmets;
<br>Furbish the spears, put on the coats of mail.
<br>5Wherefore do I see them dismayed and turned backward?
<br>And their mighty ones are beaten down,
<br>And they are fled apace, and look not back;
<br>Terror is on every side, saith the LORD.
<br>6The swift cannot flee away, Nor the mighty man escape;
<br>In the north by the river Euphrates Have they stumbled and fallen.
<br>7Who is this like the Nile that riseth up,
<br>Like the rivers whose waters toss themselves?
<br> 
<br>8Egypt is like the Nile that riseth up,
<br>And like the rivers whose waters toss themselves;
<br>And he saith: ‘I will rise up, I will cover the earth,
<br>I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof.’
<br>9Prance, ye horses, and rush madly, ye chariots;
<br>And let the mighty men go forth: Cush and Put, that handle the shield,
<br>And the Ludim, that handle and bend the bow.
<br>
<br>10For the Lord GOD of hosts shall have on that day
<br>A day of vengeance, that He may avenge Him of His adversaries;
<br>And the sword shall devour and be satiate,
<br>And shall be made drunk with their blood;
<br>For the Lord GOD of hosts hath a sacrifice
<br>In the north country by the river Euphrates.
<br>11Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin daughter of Egypt;
<br>In vain dost thou use many medicines;
<br>There is no cure for thee.
<br>12The nations have heard of thy shame,
<br>And the earth is full of thy cry;
<br>For the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty,
<br>They are fallen both of them together.
<br> 
<br>13The word that the LORD spoke to Jeremiah the prophet, how that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon should come and smite the land of Egypt.
<br>14Declare ye in Egypt, and announce in Migdol,
<br>And announce in Noph and in Tahpanhes;
<br>Say ye: ‘Stand forth, and prepare thee,
<br>For the sword hath devoured round about thee.’
<br>15Why is thy strong one overthrown?
<br>He stood not, because the LORD did thrust him down.
<br>16He made many to stumble; Yea, they fell one upon another,
<br>And said: ‘Arise, and let us return to our own people,
<br>And to the land of our birth, From the oppressing sword.’
<br>17They cried there: ‘Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise;
<br>He hath let the appointed time pass by.’
<br>18As I live, saith the King,
<br>Whose name is the LORD of hosts,
<br>Surely like Tabor among the mountains,
<br>And like Carmel by the sea, so shall he come.
<br>19O thou daughter that dwellest in Egypt,
<br>Furnish thyself to go into captivity; For Noph shall become a desolation,
<br>And shall be laid waste, without inhabitant.
<br> 
<br>
<br>20Egypt is a very fair heifer;
<br>But the gadfly out of the north is come, it is come.
<br>21Also her mercenaries in the midst of her
<br>Are like calves of the stall,
<br>For they also are turned back, they are fled away together,
<br>They did not stand;
<br>For the day of their calamity is come upon them,
<br>The time of their visitation.
<br>22The sound thereof shall go like the serpent’s;
<br>For they march with an army, And come against her with axes, As hewers of wood.
<br>23They cut down her forest, saith the LORD,
<br>Though it cannot be searched;
<br>Because they are more than the locusts,
<br>And are innumerable.
<br>24The daughter of Egypt is put to shame;
<br>She is delivered into the hand of the people of the north.
<br>25The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saith: Behold, I will punish Amon of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with her gods, and her kings; even Pharaoh, and them that trust in him; 26and I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants; and afterwards it shall be inhabited, as in the days of old, saith the LORD.
<br> 
<br>
<br>27But fear not thou, O Jacob My servant,
<br>Neither be dismayed, O Israel; For, lo, I will save thee from afar,
<br>And thy seed from the land of their captivity;
<br>And Jacob shall again be quiet and at ease,
<br>And none shall make him afraid.
<br>28Fear not thou, O Jacob My servant, saith the LORD,
<br>For I am with thee;
<br>For I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have driven thee,
<br>But I will not make a full end of thee;
<br>And I will correct thee in measure, But will not utterly destroy thee.
<br>
<br>The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet
<br>con-cerning the Philistines, before that Pharaoh smote Gaza.
<br>2Thus saith the LORD:
<br>Behold, waters rise up out of the north,
<br>And shall become an overflowing stream,
<br>And they shall overflow the land and all that is therein,
<br>The city and them that dwell therein;
<br>And the men shall cry,
<br>And all the inhabitants of the land shall wail.
<br>3At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong ones,
<br> 
<br>At the rushing of his chariots, at the rumbling of his wheels,
<br>The fathers look not back to their children
<br>For feebleness of hands; 4Because of the day that cometh To spoil all the Philistines,
<br>To cut off from Tyre and Zidon Every helper that remaineth; For the LORD will spoil the
<br>Philistines,
<br>The remnant of the isle of Caphtor.
<br>5Baldness is come upon Gaza,
<br>Ashkelon is brought to nought, the remnant of their valley;
<br>How long wilt thou cut thyself?
<br>6O thou sword of the LORD,
<br>How long will it be ere thou be quiet?
<br>Put up thyself into thy scabbard, Rest, and be still.
<br>7How canst thou be quiet?
<br>For the LORD hath given it a charge;
<br>Against Ashkelon, and against the sea-shore,
<br>There hath He appointed it.
<br>48	Of Moab.
<br>Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the
<br>God of Israel:
<br>Woe unto Nebo! for it is spoiled;
<br>Kiriathaim is put to shame, it is taken;
<br>Misgab is put to shame and dismayed.
<br>2The praise of Moab is no more;
<br>In Heshbon they have devised evil against her:
<br> 
<br>‘Come, and let us cut her off from being a nation.’
<br>Thou also, O Madmen, shalt be brought to silence;
<br>The sword shall pursue thee. 3Hark! a cry from Horonaim, Spoiling and great destruction! 4Moab is destroyed;
<br>Her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.
<br>5For by the ascent of Luhith
<br>With continual weeping shall they go up;
<br>For in the going down of Horonaim They have heard the distressing cry
<br>of destruction.
<br>6Flee, save your lives,
<br>And be like a tamarisk in the wilderness.
<br>
<br>7For, because thou hast trusted
<br>In thy works and in thy treasures, Thou also shalt be taken;
<br>And Chemosh shall go forth into captivity,
<br>His priests and his princes together.
<br>8And the spoiler shall come upon every city,
<br>And no city shall escape;
<br>The valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed;
<br>As the LORD hath spoken.
<br>9Give wings unto Moab,
<br>For she must fly and get away;
<br>And her cities shall become a desolation,
<br>Without any to dwell therein.
<br>10Cursed be he that doeth the work of the LORD with a slack hand,
<br> 
<br>And cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood.
<br>11Moab hath been at ease from his youth,
<br>And he hath settled on his lees,
<br>And hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel,
<br>Neither hath he gone into captivity;
<br>Therefore his taste remaineth in him,
<br>And his scent is not changed. 12Therefore, behold, the days come, Saith the LORD,
<br>That I will send unto him them that tilt up,
<br>And they shall tilt him up;
<br>And they shall empty his vessels, And break their bottles in pieces. 13And Moab shall be ashamed of
<br>Chemosh,
<br>As the house of Israel was ashamed Of Beth-el their confidence.
<br>
<br>14How say ye: ‘We are mighty men, And valiant men for the war’?
<br>15Moab is spoiled, and they are gone up into her cities,
<br>And his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter,
<br>Saith the King,
<br>Whose name is the LORD of hosts.
<br>16The calamity of Moab is near to come,
<br>And his affliction hasteth fast.
<br>17Bemoan him, all ye that are round about him,
<br>And all ye that know his name;
<br>Say: ‘How is the strong staff broken,
<br> 
<br>The beautiful rod! ’
<br>18O thou daughter that dwellest in Dibon,
<br>Come down from thy glory, and sit in thirst;
<br>For the spoiler of Moab is come up against thee,
<br>He hath destroyed thy strongholds.
<br>19O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and watch;
<br>Ask him that fleeth, and her that escapeth;
<br>Say: ‘What hath been done?’
<br>20Moab is put to shame, for it is dismayed;
<br>Wail and cry;
<br>Tell ye it in Arnon, That Moab is spoiled.
<br>21And judgment is come upon the country of the Plain; upon Holon, and upon Jahzah, and upon Mephaath; 22and upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Beth-diblathaim; 23and upon Kiriathaim, and upon Beth-gamul, and upon Beth-meon; 24and upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near.
<br>25The horn of Moab is cut off, And his arm is broken,
<br>Saith the LORD.
<br>26Make ye him drunken,
<br>For he magnified himself against the LORD;
<br>And Moab shall wallow in his vomit,
<br>And he also shall be in derision.
<br>27For was not Israel a derision unto thee?
<br>Was he found among thieves?
<br> 
<br>For as often as thou speakest of him, Thou waggest the head.
<br>28O ye that dwell in Moab,
<br>Leave the cities, and dwell in the rock;
<br>And be like the dove that maketh her nest
<br>In the sides of the pit’s mouth.
<br>
<br>29We have heard of the pride of Moab;
<br>He is very proud;
<br>His loftiness, and his pride, and his haughtiness,
<br>And the assumption of his heart.
<br>30I know his arrogancy, saith the LORD,
<br>That it is ill-founded;
<br>His boastings have wrought nothing well-founded.
<br>31Therefore will I wail for Moab; Yea, I will cry out for all Moab;
<br>For the men of Kir-heres shall my heart moan.
<br>32With more than the weeping of Jazer will I weep for thee,
<br>O vine of Sibmah;
<br>Thy branches passed over the sea, They reached even to the sea of
<br>Jazer;
<br>Upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage
<br>The spoiler is fallen.
<br>33And gladness and joy is taken away
<br>From the fruitful field, and from the land of Moab;
<br>And I have caused wine to cease from the winepresses;
<br> 
<br>None shall tread with shouting; The shouting shall be no shouting. 34From the cry of Heshbon even
<br>unto Elealeh,
<br>Even unto Jahaz have they uttered their voice,
<br>From Zoar even unto Horonaim, A heifer of three years old;
<br>For the Waters of Nimrim also Shall be desolate.
<br>
<br>35Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab,
<br>Saith the LORD,
<br>Him that offereth in the high place, And him that offereth to his gods. 36Therefore my heart moaneth for
<br>Moab
<br>Like pipes, and my heart moaneth like pipes for the men of Kir- heres;
<br>Therefore the abundance that he hath gotten is perished.
<br>37For every head is bald, And every beard clipped;
<br>Upon all the hands are cuttings, And upon the loins sackcloth.
<br>38On all the housetops of Moab and in the broad places thereof
<br>There is lamentation every where;
<br>For I have broken Moab like a vessel wherein is no pleasure,
<br>Saith the LORD.
<br>39’How is it broken down! ’ wail ye! ‘How hath Moab turned the back
<br>with shame! ’
<br>So shall Moab become a derision and a dismay
<br>To all that are round about him.
<br> 
<br>
<br>40For thus saith the LORD:
<br>Behold, he shall swoop as a vulture,
<br>And shall spread out his wings against Moab.
<br>41The cities are taken,
<br>And the strongholds are seized, And the heart of the mighty men of
<br>Moab at that day
<br>Shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.
<br>42And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people,
<br>Because he hath magnified himself against the LORD.
<br>43Terror, and the pit, and the trap, Are upon thee, O inhabitant of
<br>Moab,
<br>Saith the LORD.
<br>44He that fleeth from the terror Shall fall into the pit;
<br>And he that getteth up out of the pit Shall be taken in the trap;
<br>For I will bring upon her, even upon Moab,
<br>The year of their visitation, saith the LORD.
<br>
<br>45In the shadow of Heshbon the fugitives
<br>Stand without strength;
<br>For a fire is gone forth out of Heshbon,
<br>And a flame from the midst of Sihon,
<br>And it devoureth the corner of Moab,
<br>And the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.
<br> 
<br>46Woe unto thee, O Moab!
<br>The people of Chemosh is undone; For thy sons are taken away captive, And thy daughters into captivity.
<br>47Yet will I turn the captivity of Moab
<br>In the end of days, saith the LORD. Thus far is the judgment of Moab.
<br>49	Of the children of Ammon.
<br>Thus saith the LORD:
<br>Hath Israel no sons? Hath he no heir?
<br>Why then doth Malcam take possession of Gad,
<br>And his people dwell in the cities thereof?
<br>2Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD,
<br>That I will cause an alarm of war to be heard
<br>Against Rabbah of the children of Ammon;
<br>And it shall become a desolate mound,
<br>And her daughters shall be burned with fire;
<br>Then shall Israel dispossess them that did dispossess him,
<br>Saith the LORD.
<br>3Wail, O Heshbon, for Ai is undone;
<br>Cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth;
<br>Lament, and run to and fro among the folds;
<br>For Malcam shall go into captivity, His priests and his princes together.
<br> 
<br>4Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys,
<br>Thy flowing valley, O backsliding daughter?
<br>That didst trust in thy treasures: ‘Who shall come unto me?’ 5Behold, I will bring a terror upon
<br>thee,
<br>Saith the Lord GOD of hosts,
<br>From all that are round about thee;
<br>And ye shall be driven out every man right forth,
<br>And there shall be none to gather up him that wandereth.
<br>6But afterward I will bring back the captivity of the children of Ammon,
<br>Saith the LORD.
<br>
<br>7Of Edom.
<br>
<br>Thus saith the LORD of hosts: Is wisdom no more in Teman?
<br>Is counsel perished from the prudent?
<br>Is their wisdom vanished? 8Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan;
<br>For I do bring the calamity of Esau upon him,
<br>The time that I shall punish him.
<br>9If grape-gatherers came to thee,
<br>Would they not leave some gleaning grapes?
<br>If thieves by night,
<br>Would they not destroy till they had enough?
<br>10But I have made Esau bare,
<br>I have uncovered his secret places,
<br> 
<br>And he shall not be able to hide himself;
<br>His seed is spoiled, and his brethren, And his neighbours, and he is not.
<br>11Leave thy fatherless children, I will rear them,
<br>And let thy widows trust in Me.
<br>12For thus saith the LORD: Behold, they to whom it pertained not to drink of the cup shall assuredly drink; and art thou he that shall altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink. 13For I have sworn by Myself, saith the LORD, that Bozrah shall become an astonishment, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes.
<br>14I have heard a message from the LORD,
<br>And an ambassador is sent among the nations:
<br>‘Gather yourselves together, and come against her,
<br>And rise up to the battle.’
<br>15For, behold, I make thee small among the nations,
<br>And despised among men.
<br>16Thy terribleness hath deceived thee,
<br>Even the pride of thy heart,
<br>O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock,
<br>That holdest the height of the hill;
<br>Though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle,
<br>I will bring thee down from thence, saith the LORD.
<br> 
<br>17And Edom shall become an astonishment;
<br>Every one that passeth by it
<br>Shall be astonished and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof.
<br>18As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah
<br>And the neighbour cities thereof, saith the LORD,
<br>No man shall abide there,
<br>Neither shall any son of man dwell therein.
<br>19Behold, he shall come up like a lion From the thickets of the Jordan
<br>Against the strong habitation;
<br>For I will suddenly make him run away from it,
<br>And whoso is chosen, him will I appoint over it;
<br>For who is like Me? and who will appoint Me a time?
<br>And who is that shepherd that will stand before Me?
<br>20Therefore hear ye the counsel of the LORD,
<br>That He hath taken against Edom;
<br>And His purposes, that He hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman:
<br>Surely the least of the flock shall drag them away,
<br>Surely their habitation shall be appalled at them.
<br>21The earth quaketh at the noise of their fall;
<br>There is a cry, the noise whereof is heard in the Red Sea.
<br> 
<br>22Behold, he shall come up and swoop down as the vulture,
<br>And spread out his wings against Bozrah;
<br>And the heart of the mighty men of Edom at that day
<br>Shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.
<br>
<br>23Of Damascus.
<br>
<br>Hamath is ashamed, and Arpad; For they have heard evil tidings,
<br>they are melted away; There is trouble in the sea; It cannot be quiet.
<br>24Damascus is waxed feeble, she turneth herself to flee,
<br>And trembling hath seized on her;
<br>Anguish and pangs have taken hold of her, as of a woman in travail.
<br>25’How is the city of praise left unrepaired,
<br>The city of my joy?’
<br>26Therefore her young men shall fall in her broad places,
<br>And all the men of war shall be brought to silence in that day,
<br>Saith the LORD of hosts.
<br>27And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus,
<br>And it shall devour the palaces of Ben-hadad.
<br>
<br>28Of Kedar, and of the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote.
<br>Thus saith the LORD:
<br>Arise ye, go up against Kedar,
<br> 
<br>And spoil the children of the east.
<br>29Their tents and their flocks shall they take,
<br>They shall carry away for themselves their curtains,
<br>And all their vessels, and their camels;
<br>And they shall proclaim against them a terror on every side.
<br>30Flee ye, flit far off, dwell deep,
<br>O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith the LORD;
<br>For Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you,
<br>And hath conceived a purpose against you.
<br>31Arise, get you up against a nation that is at ease,
<br>That dwelleth without care, saith the LORD;
<br>That have neither gates nor bars, That dwell alone.
<br>32And their camels shall be a booty,
<br>And the multitude of their cattle a spoil;
<br>And I will scatter unto all winds them that have the corners polled;
<br>And I will bring their calamity from every side of them, saith the LORD.
<br>33And Hazor shall be a dwelling- place of jackals,
<br>A desolation for ever; no man shall abide there,
<br>Neither shall any son of man dwell therein.
<br> 
<br>34The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying:
<br>35Thus saith the LORD of hosts: Behold, I will break the bow of
<br>Elam
<br>The chief of their might.
<br>36And I will bring against Elam the four winds
<br>From the four quarters of heaven,
<br>And will scatter them toward all those winds;
<br>And there shall be no nation whither the dispersed of Elam shall not come.
<br>37And I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies,
<br>And before them that seek their life; And I will bring evil upon them, Even My fierce anger, saith the
<br>LORD;
<br>And I will send the sword after them,
<br>Till I have consumed them;
<br>38And I will set My throne in Elam,
<br>And will destroy from thence king and princes, saith the LORD.
<br>39But it shall come to pass in the end of days,
<br>That I will bring back the captivity of Elam, saith the LORD.
<br>
<br>The word that the LORD spoke concerning	Babylon, concerning the land of the Chaldeans,
<br>by Jeremiah the prophet.
<br>2Declare ye among the nations and announce,
<br> 
<br>And set up a standard; Announce, and conceal not; Say: ‘Babylon is taken,
<br>Bel is put to shame, Merodach is dismayed;
<br>Her images are put to shame, her idols are dismayed.’
<br>3For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her,
<br>Which shall make her land desolate, And none shall dwell therein;
<br>They are fled, they are gone, both man and beast.
<br>4In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD,
<br>The children of Israel shall come,
<br>They and the children of Judah together;
<br>They shall go on their way weeping, And shall seek the LORD their God. 5They shall inquire concerning Zion With their faces hitherward:
<br>‘Come ye, and join yourselves to the LORD
<br>In an everlasting covenant that shall not be forgotten.’
<br>
<br>6My people hath been lost sheep;
<br>Their shepherds have caused them to go astray,
<br>They have turned them away on the mountains;
<br>They have gone from mountain to hill,
<br>They have forgotten their resting- place.
<br>7All that found them have devoured them;
<br> 
<br>And their adversaries said: ‘We are not guilty’;
<br>Because they have sinned against the LORD, the habitation of justice,
<br>Even the LORD, the hope of their fathers.
<br>
<br>8Flee out of the midst of Babylon, And go forth out of the land of the
<br>Chaldeans,
<br>And be as the he-goats before the flocks.
<br>9For, lo, I will stir up and cause to come up against Babylon
<br>An assembly of great nations from the north country;
<br>And they shall set themselves in array against her,
<br>From thence she shall be taken;
<br>Their arrows shall be as of a mighty man that maketh childless;
<br>None shall return in vain.
<br>10And Chaldea shall be a spoil; All that spoil her shall be satisfied,
<br>saith the LORD.
<br>11Because ye are glad, because ye rejoice,
<br>O ye that plunder My heritage,
<br>Because ye gambol as a heifer at grass,
<br>And neigh as strong horses;
<br>12Your mother shall be sore ashamed,
<br>She that bore you shall be confounded;
<br>Behold, the hindermost of the nations
<br>Shall be a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.
<br> 
<br>13Because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited,
<br>But it shall be wholly desolate; Every one that goeth by Babylon Shall be appalled and hiss at all her
<br>plagues.
<br>14Set yourselves in array against Babylon round about,
<br>All ye that bend the bow, Shoot at her, spare no arrows; For she hath sinned against the
<br>LORD.
<br>15Shout against her round about, she hath submitted herself;
<br>Her buttresses are fallen, her walls are thrown down;
<br>For it is the vengeance of the LORD, take vengeance upon her;
<br>As she hath done, do unto her.
<br>16Cut off the sower from Babylon,
<br>And him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest;
<br>For fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people,
<br>And they shall flee every one to his own land.
<br>
<br>17Israel is a scattered sheep,
<br>The lions have driven him away;
<br>First the king of Assyria hath devoured him,
<br>And last this Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones.
<br>18Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel:
<br>Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land,
<br> 
<br>As I have punished the king of Assyria.
<br>19And I will bring Israel back to his pasture,
<br>And he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan,
<br>And his soul shall be satisfied upon the hills of Ephraim and in Gilead.
<br>20In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD,
<br>The iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none,
<br>And the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found;
<br>For I will pardon them whom I leave as a remnant.
<br>
<br>21Go up against the land of
<br>aMerathaim, even against it,
<br>And against the inhabitants of
<br>bPekod;
<br>Waste and utterly destroy after them, saith the LORD,
<br>And do according to all that I have commanded thee.
<br>22Hark! battle is in the land, And great destruction.
<br>23How is the hammer of the whole earth
<br>Cut asunder and broken! How is Babylon become
<br>A desolation among the nations! 24I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon,
<br>And thou wast not aware;
<br>
<br>a That is, Double rebellion.
<br>b That is, Visitation.
<br> 
<br>Thou art found, and also caught,
<br>Because thou hast striven against the LORD.
<br>25The LORD hath opened His armoury,
<br>And hath brought forth the weapons of His indignation;
<br>For it is a work that the Lord GOD of hosts
<br>Hath to do in the land of the Chaldeans.
<br>26Come against her from every quarter, open her granaries,
<br>Cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly;
<br>Let nothing of her be left.
<br>27Slay all her bullocks, let them go down to the slaughter;
<br>Woe unto them! for their day is come,
<br>The time of their visitation.
<br>28Hark! they flee and escape out of the land of Babylon,
<br>To declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God,
<br>The vengeance of His temple.
<br>29Call together the archers against Babylon,
<br>All them that bend the bow; Encamp against her round about, Let none thereof escape;
<br>Recompense her according to her work,
<br>According to all that she hath done, do unto her:
<br>For she hath been arrogant against the LORD,
<br>Against the Holy One of Israel.
<br> 
<br>30Therefore shall her young men fall in her broad places,
<br>And all her men of war shall be brought to silence in that day,
<br>Saith the LORD.
<br>
<br>31Behold, I am against thee, O thou most arrogant,
<br>Saith the Lord GOD of hosts; For thy day is come,
<br>The time that I will punish thee.
<br>32And the most arrogant shall stumble and fall,
<br>And none shall raise him up;
<br>And I will kindle a fire in his cities,
<br>And it shall devour all that are round about him.
<br>
<br>33Thus saith the LORD of hosts:
<br>The children of Israel and the children of Judah are oppressed together;
<br>And all that took them captives hold them fast;
<br>They refuse to let them go. 34Their Redeemer is strong, The LORD of hosts is His name;
<br>He will thoroughly plead their cause,
<br>That He may give rest to the earth, And disquiet the inhabitants of
<br>Babylon.
<br>35A sword is upon the Chaldeans, saith the LORD,
<br>And upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise men.
<br>36A sword is upon the boasters, and they shall become fools;
<br> 
<br>A sword is upon her mighty men, and they shall be dismayed.
<br>37A sword is upon their horses, and upon their chariots,
<br>And upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her,
<br>And they shall become as women;
<br>A sword is upon her treasures, and they shall be robbed.
<br>38A drought is upon her waters, and they shall be dried up;
<br>For it is a land of graven images,
<br>And they are mad upon things of horror.
<br>39Therefore the wild-cats with the jackals shall dwell there,
<br>And the ostriches shall dwell therein; and it shall be no more inhabited for ever,
<br>Neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation.
<br>40As when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah
<br>And the neighbour cities thereof, saith the LORD;
<br>So shall no man abide there,
<br>Neither shall any son of man dwell therein.
<br>
<br>41Behold, a people cometh from the north,
<br>And a great nation, and many kings Shall be roused from the uttermost
<br>parts of the earth.
<br>42They lay hold on bow and spear,
<br>They are cruel, and have no compassion;
<br>Their voice is like the roaring sea, And they ride upon horses;
<br> 
<br>Set in array, as a man for war, Against thee, O daughter of
<br>Babylon.
<br>43The king of Babylon hath heard the fame of them,
<br>And his hands wax feeble; Anguish hath taken hold of him, And pain, as of a woman in travail. 44Behold, he shall come up like a
<br>lion from the thickets of the Jordan
<br>Against the strong habitation;
<br>For I will suddenly make them run away from it,
<br>And whoso is chosen, him will I appoint over it;
<br>For who is like Me? and who will appoint Me a time?
<br>And who is that shepherd that will stand before Me?
<br>45Therefore hear ye the counsel of the LORD,
<br>That He hath taken against Babylon,
<br>And His purposes, that He hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans:
<br>Surely the least of the flock shall drag them away,
<br>Surely their habitation shall be appalled at them.
<br>46At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth quaketh,
<br>And the cry is heard among the nations.
<br>
<br>Thus saith the LORD:
<br>Behold, I will raise up against Babylon,
<br> 
<br>And against them that dwell in aLeb- kamai, a destroying wind.
<br>2And I will send unto Babylon strangers, that shall fan her, And they shall empty her land;
<br>For in the day of trouble they shall be against her round about.
<br>3Let the archer bend his bow against her,
<br>And let him lift himself up against her in his coat of mail;
<br>And spare ye not her young men, Destroy ye utterly all her host.
<br>4And they shall fall down slain in the land of the Chaldeans,
<br>And thrust through in her streets.
<br>5For Israel is not widowed, nor Judah,
<br>Of his God, of the LORD of hosts; For their land is full of guilt Against the Holy One of Israel. 6Flee out of the midst of Babylon, And save every man his life,
<br>Be not cut off in her iniquity;
<br>For it is the time of the LORD’S vengeance;
<br>He will render unto her a recompense.
<br>7Babylon hath been a golden cup in LORD’S hand,
<br>That made all the earth drunken; The nations have drunk of her wine, Therefore the nations are mad.
<br>
<br>
<br>a That is, The heart of them that rises up against Me. According to ancient tradition, a cipher for Casdim, that is Chaldea.
<br> 
<br>8Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed,
<br>Wail for her;
<br>Take balm for her pain,
<br>If so be she may be healed.
<br>9We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed;
<br>Forsake her, and let us go every one into his own country;
<br>For her judgment reacheth unto heaven,
<br>And is lifted up even to the skies.
<br>10The LORD hath brought forth our victory;
<br>Come, and let us declare in Zion The work of the LORD our God.
<br>
<br>11Make bright the arrows, Fill the quivers,
<br>The LORD hath roused the spirit of the kings of the Medes;
<br>Because His device is against Babylon, to destroy it;
<br>For it is the vengeance of the LORD, The vengeance of His temple.
<br>12Set up a standard against the walls of Babylon,
<br>Make the watch strong,
<br>Set the watchmen, prepare the ambushes;
<br>For the LORD hath both devised and done
<br>That which He spoke concerning the inhabitants of Babylon.
<br>13O thou that dwellest upon many waters,
<br>Abundant in treasures, Thine end is come,
<br>The measure of thy covetousness.
<br> 
<br>14The LORD of hosts hath sworn by Himself:
<br>Surely I will fill thee with men, as with the canker-worm,
<br>And they shall lift up a shout against thee.
<br>
<br>15He that hath made the earth by His power,
<br>That hath established the world by His wisdom,
<br>And hath stretched out the heavens by His discernment;
<br>16At the sound of His giving a multitude of waters in the heavens,
<br>He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth;
<br>He maketh lightnings at the time of the rain,
<br>And bringeth forth the wind out of His treasuries;
<br>17Every man is proved to be brutish, for the knowledge—
<br>Every goldsmith is put to shame by the graven image—
<br>That his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.
<br>18They are vanity, a work of delusion;
<br>In the time of their visitation they shall perish,
<br>19The portion of Jacob is not like these;
<br>For He is the former of all things,
<br>And [Israel] is the tribe of His inheritance;
<br>The LORD of hosts is His name.
<br> 
<br>20Thou art My maul and weapons of war,
<br>And with thee will I shatter the nations,
<br>And with thee will I destroy kingdoms;
<br>21And with thee will I shatter the horse and his rider,
<br>And with thee will I shatter the chariot and him that rideth therein;
<br>22And with thee will I shatter man and woman,
<br>And with thee will I shatter the old man and the youth,
