<br>§1735f–11. Review of mortgagee performance and authority to terminate
<br>(a) Periodic review of mortgagee performance
<br>
<br>To reduce losses in connection with single family mortgage insurance programs under this chapter, at least once a year the Secretary shall review the rate of early defaults and claims for insured single family mortgages originated or underwritten by each mortgagee.
<br>(b) Comparison with other mortgagees
<br>
<br>For each mortgagee, the Secretary shall compare the rate of early defaults and claims for insured single family mortgage loans originated or underwritten by the mortgagee in an area with the rate of early defaults and claims for other mortgagees originating or underwriting insured single family mortgage loans in the area. For purposes of this section, the term "area" means each geographic area in which the mortgagee is authorized by the Secretary to originate insured single family mortgages.
<br>(c) Termination of mortgagee origination approval
<br>
<br>(1) Notwithstanding section 1708(c) of this title, the Secretary may terminate the approval of a mortgagee to originate or underwrite single family mortgages if the Secretary determines that the mortgage loans originated or underwritten by the mortgagee present an unacceptable risk to the insurance funds. The determination shall be based on the comparison required under subsection (b) and shall be made in accordance with regulations of the Secretary. The Secretary may rely on existing regulations published before this section takes effect.
<br>
<br>(2) The Secretary shall give a mortgagee at least 60 days prior written notice of any termination under this subsection. The termination shall take effect at the end of the notice period, unless the Secretary withdraws the termination notice or extends the notice period. If requested in writing by the mortgagee within 30 days of the date of the notice, the mortgagee shall be entitled to an informal conference with the official authorized to issue termination notices on behalf of the Secretary (or a designee of that official). At the informal conference, the mortgagee may present for consideration specific factors that it believes were beyond its control and that caused the excessive default and claim rate.

<br>
<br>(C) may provide for review by the Secretary of any determination or order, or interlocutory ruling, arising from a hearing.
<br>(2) Final orders
<br>
<br>If no hearing is requested within 15 days of receipt of the notice of opportunity for hearing, the imposition of the penalty shall constitute a final and unappealable determination.

If the Secretary does not review the determination or order within 90 days of the issuance of the determination or order, the determination or order shall be final.
<br>(3) Factors in determining amount of penalty
<br>
<br>In determining the amount of a penalty under subsection (b) or (c), consideration shall be given to such factors as the gravity of the offense, any history of prior offenses (including offenses occurring before December 15, 1989), ability to pay the penalty, injury to the tenants, injury to the public, benefits received, deterrence of future violations, and such other factors as the Secretary may determine in regulations to be appropriate.

<br>(2) Objections not raised in hearing
<br>
<br>The court shall not consider any objection that was not raised in the hearing conducted pursuant to subsection (d)(1) unless a demonstration is made of extraordinary circumstances causing the failure to raise the objection. If any party demonstrates to the satisfaction of the court that additional evidence not presented at such hearing is material and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to present such evidence at the hearing, the court shall remand the matter to the Secretary for consideration of such additional evidence.
<br>(3) Scope of review
<br>
<br>The decisions, findings, and determinations of the Secretary shall be reviewed pursuant to section 706 of title 5.
<br>(4) Order to pay penalty
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in any such review, the court shall have the power to order payment of the penalty imposed by the Secretary.
<br>(f) Civil money penalties against multifamily mortgagors, general partners of partnership mortgagors, officers and directors of corporate mortgagors, and certain managing agents
<br>
<br>If a mortgagor, general partner of a partnership mortgagor, officer or director of a corporate mortgagor, or identity of interest agent employed to manage the property fails to comply with the Secretary's determination or order imposing a civil money penalty under subsection (b) or (c), after the determination or order is no longer subject to review as provided by subsections (d)(1) and (e), the Secretary may request the Attorney General of the United States to bring an action in an appropriate United States district court to obtain a monetary judgment against the mortgagor, general partner of a partnership mortgagor, officer or director of a corporate mortgagor, or identity of interest agent employed to manage the property and such other relief as may be available. The monetary judgment may, in the court's discretion, include the attorneys fees and other expenses incurred by the United States in connection with the action. In an action under this subsection, the validity and appropriateness of the Secretary's determination or order imposing the penalty shall not be subject to review.
<br>(g) Settlement by Secretary
<br>
<br>The Secretary may compromise, modify, or remit any civil money penalty which may be, or has been, imposed under this section.
<br>(h) "Knowingly" defined
<br>
<br>The term "knowingly" means having actual knowledge of or acting with deliberate ignorance of or reckless disregard for the prohibitions under this section.

<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all civil money penalties collected under this section shall be deposited in the fund established under section 1715z–1a(j) of this title.
<br>(k) Identity of interest managing agent
<br>
<br>In this section, the terms "agent employed to manage the property that has an identity of interest" and "identity of interest agent" mean an entity—
<br>
<br>(1) that has management responsibility for a project;
<br>
<br>(2) in which the ownership entity, including its general partner or partners (if applicable) and its officers or directors (if applicable), has an ownership interest; and

<br>§1735g. Mortgage relief for homeowners who are unemployed as result of closing of Federal installation
<br>(a) Definitions
<br>
<br>For the purposes of this section—
<br>
<br>(1) The term "mortgage" means a mortgage which (A) is insured under the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.], or (B) secures a home loan guaranteed or insured under the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944 or chapter 37 of title 38.
<br>
<br>(2) The term "Federal mortgage agency" means—
<br>
<br>(A) The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development when used in connection with mortgages insured under the National Housing Act, and
<br>
<br>(B) the Secretary of Veterans Affairs when used in connection with mortgages securing home loans guaranteed or insured under the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944 or chapter 37 of title 38.
<br>
<br>(3) The term "distressed mortgagor" means an individual who—
<br>
<br>(A) was employed by the Federal Government at, or was assigned as a serviceman to, a military base or other Federal installation and whose employment or service at such base or installation was terminated subsequent to November 1, 1964, as the result of the closing (in whole or in part) of such base or installation; and
<br>
<br>(B) is the owner-occupant of a dwelling situated at or near such base or installation and upon which there is a mortgage securing a loan which is in default because of the inability of such individual to make payments due under such mortgage.
<br>(b) Application for, issuance and expiration of certificate of moratorium
<br>
<br>(1) Any distressed mortgagor, for the purpose of avoiding foreclosure of his mortgage, may apply to the appropriate Federal mortgage agency for a determination that suspension of his obligation to make payments due under such mortgage during a temporary period is necessary in order to avoid such foreclosure.
<br>
<br>(2) Upon receipt of an application made under this subsection by a distressed mortgagor, the Federal mortgage agency shall issue to such mortgagor a certificate of moratorium if it determines, after consultation with the interested mortgagee, that such action is necessary to avoid foreclosure.
<br>
<br>(3) Prior to the issuance to any distressed mortgagor of a certificate of moratorium under paragraph (2), the Federal mortgage agency, the mortgagor, and the mortgagee shall enter into a binding agreement under which—
<br>
<br>(A) the mortgagor will be required to make payments to such agency, after the expiration of such certificate, in an aggregate amount equal to the amount paid by such agency on behalf of such mortgagor as provided in subsection (c), together with interest thereon at a rate not to exceed the rate provided in the mortgage; the manner and time in which such payments shall be made to be determined by the Federal mortgage agency having due regard for the purposes sought to be achieved by this section; and
<br>
<br>(B) the Federal mortgage agency will be subrogated to the rights of the mortgagee to the extent of payments made pursuant to such certificate, which rights, however, shall be subject to the prior right of the mortgagee to receive the full amount payable under the mortgage.
<br>
<br>(4) Any certificate of moratorium issued under this subsection shall expire on whichever of the following dates is the earliest—
<br>
<br>(A) two years from the date on which such certificate was issued;
<br>
<br>(B) thirty days after the date on which the mortgagor gives notice in writing to the Federal mortgage agency that he is able to resume his obligation to make payments due under his mortgage; or
<br>
<br>(C) thirty days after the date on which the Federal mortgage agency determines that the mortgagor to whom such certificate was issued has ceased to be a distressed mortgagor as defined in subsection (a)(3).
<br>(c) Notice to mortgagee of assumption of mortgagor's obligation by agency; amount of payments; suspension of payments by mortgagor; prohibition against further action to enforce or collect payments; liability of mortgagor upon expiration of certificate; notice of expiration of certificate
<br>
<br>(1) Whenever a Federal mortgage agency issues a certificate of moratorium to any distressed mortgagor with respect to any mortgage, it shall transmit to the mortgagee a copy of such certificate, together with a notice stating that, while such certificate is in effect, such agency will assume the obligation of such mortgagor to make payments due under the mortgage.
<br>
<br>(2) Payments made by any Federal mortgage agency pursuant to a certificate of moratorium issued under this section with respect to the mortgage of any distressed mortgagor may include, in addition to the payments referred to in paragraph (1), an amount equal to the unpaid payments under such mortgage prior to the issuance of such certificate, plus a reasonable allowance for foreclosure costs actually paid by the mortgagee if a foreclosure action was dismissed as a result of the issuance of a moratorium certificate. Payments by the Federal mortgage agency may also include payments of taxes and insurance premiums on the mortgaged property as deemed necessary when these items are not provided for through payments to a tax and insurance account held by the interested mortgagee.
<br>
<br>(3) While any certificate of moratorium issued under this section is in effect with respect to the mortgage of any distressed mortgagor, no further payments due under the mortgage shall be required of such mortgagor, and no action (legal or otherwise) shall be taken or maintained by the mortgagee to enforce or collect such payments. Upon the expiration of such certificate, the mortgagor shall again be liable for the payment of all amounts due under the mortgage in accordance with its terms.
<br>
<br>(4) Each Federal mortgage agency shall give prompt notice in writing to the interested mortgagor and mortgagee of the expiration of any certificate of moratorium issued by it under this section.
<br>(d) Regulations
<br>
<br>The Federal mortgage agencies are authorized to issue such individual and joint regulations as may be necessary to carry out this section and to insure the uniform administration thereof.
<br>(e) Fund for extending financial assistance to distressed mortgagors
<br>
<br>There shall be in the Treasury (1) a fund which shall be available to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development for the purpose of extending financial assistance in behalf of distressed mortgagors as provided in subsection (c) and for paying administrative expenses incurred in connection with such assistance, and (2) a fund which shall be available to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for the same purpose, except administrative expenses. The capital of each such fund shall consist of such sums as may, from time to time, be appropriated thereto, and any sums so appropriated shall remain available until expended. Receipts arising from the programs of assistance under subsection (c) shall be credited to the funds from which such assistance was extended. Moneys in either of such funds not needed for current operations, as determined by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, or the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, as the case may be, shall be invested in bonds or other obligations of the United States, or paid into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.

<br>In order to assist in relieving the acute shortage of housing which now exists and to increase the supply of housing accommodations available to veterans of World War II at prices within their reasonable ability to pay, the Secretary is authorized, upon application by the mortgagee, to insure as hereinafter provided any mortgage which is eligible for insurance as hereinafter provided, and, upon such terms as the Secretary may prescribe, to make commitments for the insuring of such mortgages prior to the date of their execution or disbursement thereon: Provided, That the aggregate amount of principal obligations of all mortgages insured under this subchapter shall not exceed $6,150,000,000 except that with the approval of the President such aggregate amount may be increased to not to exceed $6,650,000,000: Provided further, That no mortgage shall be insured under this section after April 30, 1948, except (A) pursuant to a commitment to insure issued on or before April 30, 1948, or (B) a mortgage given to refinance an existing mortgage insured under this section and which does not exceed the original principal amount and unexpired term of such existing mortgage, and no mortgage shall be insured under section 1743 of this title after March 1, 1950, except (i) pursuant to a commitment to insure issued on or before March 1, 1950, or (ii) a mortgage given to refinance an existing mortgage insured under section 1743 of this title and which does not exceed the original principal amount and unexpired term of such existing mortgage: Provided further, That no mortgage shall be insured under section 1743 of this title unless the mortgagor certifies under oath that in selecting tenants for the property covered by the mortgage he will not discriminate against any family by reason of the fact that there are children in the family, and that he will not sell the property while the insurance is in effect unless the purchaser so certifies, such certifications to be filed with the Secretary; and violation of any such certification shall be a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not to exceed $500: And provided further, That the Secretary shall, in his discretion, have power to require the availability for rental purposes of properties covered by mortgages insured under this subchapter, in such instances and for such periods of time as he may prescribe.
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding the first proviso of this subsection, mortgages may be insured under sections 1744 and 1746 of this title if the aggregate amounts of principal obligations of mortgages insured under said sections plus the aggregate amount of principal obligations of mortgages insured under section 1745 of this title do not exceed the limitation contained in said section 1745 upon the aggregate amount of principal obligations of mortgages insured pursuant to said section.
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding the second proviso of this subsection, mortgages otherwise eligible for insurance under section 1743 of this title may be hereafter insured thereunder if the application for such insurance was received by the Department of Housing and Urban Development on or before March 1, 1950, and for such purpose the aggregate amount of principal obligations authorized to be insured under section 1743 of this title is increased by not to exceed $500,000,000.
<br>(b) Eligibility requirements
<br>
<br>To be eligible for insurance under this section a mortgage shall—
<br>
<br>(1) have been made to, and be held by, a mortgagee approved by the Secretary as responsible and able to service the mortgage properly;
<br>
<br>(2) involve a principal obligation (including such initial service charges, appraisal, inspection, and other fees as the Secretary shall approve) in an amount not to exceed 90 per centum of the Secretary's estimate of the value (as of the date the mortgage is accepted for insurance), except that as to applications received by the Secretary on or before March 31, 1948, the mortgage may involve a principal obligation in an amount not to exceed 90 per centum of the Secretary's estimate of the necessary current cost (including the land and such initial service charges and such appraisal, inspection, and other fees as the Secretary shall approve); of a property, urban, suburban, or rural, upon which there is located a dwelling designed principally for residential use for not more than four families in the aggregate, which is approved for mortgage insurance prior to the beginning of construction. The principal obligation of such mortgage shall in no event, however, exceed—
<br>
<br>(A) $5,400 if such dwelling is designed for a single-family residence, or
<br>
<br>(B) $7,500 if such dwelling is designed for a two-family residence, or
<br>
<br>(C) $9,500 if such dwelling is designed for a three-family residence, or
<br>
<br>(D) $12,000 if such dwelling is designed for a four-family residence:
<br>
<br>Provided, That the Secretary may, if he finds that at any time or in any particular geographical area it is not feasible, within such limitations of maximum mortgage amounts, to construct dwellings without sacrifice of sound standards of construction, design, or livability, prescribe by regulation or otherwise higher maximum mortgage amounts not to exceed—
<br>
<br>(A) $8,100 if such dwelling is designed for a single-family residence, or
<br>
<br>(B) $12,500 if such dwelling is designed for a two-family residence, or
<br>
<br>(C) $15,750 if such dwelling is designed for a three-family residence, or
<br>
<br>(D) $18,000 if such dwelling is designed for a four-family residence.
<br>
<br>(3) have a maturity satisfactory to the Secretary but not to exceed twenty-five years from the date of the insurance of the mortgage;
<br>
<br>(4) contain complete amortization provisions satisfactory to the Secretary;
<br>
<br>(5) bear interest (exclusive of premium charges for insurance) at not to exceed 4 per centum per annum on the amount of the principal obligation outstanding at any time;
<br>
<br>(6) provide, in a manner satisfactory to the Secretary, for the application of the mortgagor's periodic payments (exclusive of the amount allocated to interest and to the premium charge which is required for mortgage insurance as herein provided) to amortization of the principal of the mortgage; and
<br>
<br>(7) contain such terms and provisions with respect to insurance, repairs, alterations, payment of taxes, default reserves, delinquency charges, foreclosure proceedings, anticipation of maturity, additional and secondary liens, and other matters as the Secretary may in his discretion prescribe.
<br>(c) Premium charges; payments; acceptance for insurance; preferences; adjustments and refunds
<br>
<br>The Secretary is authorized to fix a premium charge for the insurance of mortgages under this subchapter but in the case of any mortgage such charge shall not be less than an amount equivalent to one-half of 1 per centum per annum nor more than an amount equivalent to 1½ per centum per annum of the amount of the principal obligation of the mortgage outstanding at any time, without taking into account delinquent payments or prepayments. Such premium charges shall be payable by the mortgagee, either in cash, or in debentures issued by the Secretary under this subchapter at par plus accrued interest, in such manner as may be prescribed by the Secretary: Provided, That the Secretary may require the payment of one or more such premium charges at the time the mortgage is insured, at such discount rate as he may prescribe not in excess of the interest rate specified in the mortgage. If the Secretary finds, upon the presentation of a mortgage for insurance and the tender of the initial premium charge and such other charges as the Secretary may require, that the mortgage complies with the provisions of this subchapter, such mortgage may be accepted for insurance by endorsement or otherwise as the Secretary may prescribe; but no mortgage shall be accepted for insurance under this subchapter unless the Secretary finds that the project with respect to which the mortgage is executed is an acceptable risk in view of the shortage of housing referred to in this section. In the event that the principal obligation of any mortgage accepted for insurance under this subchapter is paid in full prior to the maturity date, the Secretary is further authorized in his discretion to require the payment by the mortgagee of an adjusted premium charge in such amount as the Secretary determines to be equitable, but not in excess of the aggregate amount of the premium charges that the mortgagee would otherwise have been required to pay if the mortgage had continued to be insured under this subchapter until such maturity date; and in the event that the principal obligation is paid in full as herein set forth, the Secretary is authorized to refund to the mortgagee for the account of the mortgagor all, or such portion as he shall determine to be equitable, of the current unearned premium charges theretofore paid. The Secretary shall prescribe such procedures as in his judgment are necessary to secure to veterans of World War II, and their immediate families, and to hardship cases as defined by the Secretary, preference or priority of opportunity to purchase or rent properties covered by mortgages insured under this subchapter.
<br>(d) Conclusiveness of insurance contract as to eligibility
<br>
<br>Any contract of insurance heretofore or hereafter executed by the Secretary under this subchapter shall be conclusive evidence of the eligibility of the mortgage for insurance, and the validity of any contract of insurance so executed shall be incontestable in the hands of an approved mortgagee from the date of the execution of such contract, except for fraud or misrepresentation on the part of such approved mortgagee.
