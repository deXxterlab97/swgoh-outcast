<br> 
<br>all their borders, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.
<br>9	In the fourth year of king Ezechias, which was the seventh vear of Osee, the son of Ela, king of Israel, Salmanasar, king of the Assyrians, came up to Samaria, and besieged it,
<br>11	And the king of the Assyrians carried away Israel into Assyria, and placed them in Hala, and in Habor, by the rivers of Gozan, in the cities of the Medes.
<br>12	Because they hearkened not to the voice of the Lord, their God, but transgressed his covenant: all that Moses, the servant of the Lord, commanded, they would not hear, nor do.
<br>13	In the fourteenth year of king Ezechias, Sennacherib, king of the Assyrians, came up against the fenced cities of Juda, and took them.
<br>14	Then Ezechias, king of Juda, sent mes- sengers to the king of the Assyrians, to Lachis, saying: I have offended, depart from me: and all that thou shalt put upon me, I will bear. And the king of the Assyrians put a tax upon Ezechias, king of Juda, of three hundred talents of silver, and thirty talents of gold.
<br>15	And Ezechias gave all the silver that was found in the house of the Lord, and in the king’s treasures.
<br>16	At that time Ezechias broke the doors of the temple of the Lord, and the plates of gold which he had fastened on them, and gave them to the king of the Assyrians.
<br>17	And the king of the Assyrians sent Tharthan, and Rabsaris, and Rabsaces, from Lachis, to king Ezechias, with a strong army, to Jerusalem: and they went up and came to Jerusalem, and they stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the way of the fuller’s field.
<br>18	And they called for the king: and there went out to them Eliacim, the son of Helcias,
<br> 
<br>who was over the house, and Sobna, the scribe, and Joahe, the son of Asaph, the recorder.
<br>19	And Rabsaces said to them: Speak to Ezechias: Thus saith the great king, the king of the Assyrians: What is this confidence, wherein thou trustest?
<br>20	Perhaps thou hast taken counsel, to pre- pare thyself for battle. On whom dost thou trust, that thou darest to rebel?
<br>21	Dost thou trust in Egypt a staff of a broken reed, upon which if a man lean, it will break and go into his hand, and pierce it? so is Pharao, king of Egypt, to all that trust in him.
<br>22	But if you say to me: We trust in the Lord, our God: is it not he, whose high places and al- tars Ezechias hath taken away: and hath com- manded Juda and Jerusalem: You shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?
<br>23	Now therefore come over to my master, the king of the Assyrians, and I will give you two thousand horses, and see whether you be able to have riders for them.
<br>24	And how can you stand against one lord of the least of my master’s servants? Dost thou trust in Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
<br>25	Is it without the will of the Lord that I am come up to this place to destroy it? The Lord said to me: Go up to this land, and destroy it.
<br>26	Then Eliacim, the son of Helcias, and Sobna, and Joahe, said to Rabsaces: We pray thee, speak to us, thy servants, in Syriac: for we understand that tongue: and speak not to us in the Jews’ language, in the hearing of the people that are upon the wall.
<br>27	And Rabsaces answered them, saying: Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words, and not rather to the men that sit upon the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their urine with you? 28 Then Rabsaces stood, and cried out with a
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>loud voice in the Jews’ language, and said: Hear the word of the great king, the king of the As- syrians.
<br>29	Thus saith the king: Let not Ezechias de- ceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you out of my hand.
<br>30	Neither let him make you trust in the Lord, saying: The Lord will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of the Assyrians.
<br>31	Do not hearken to Ezechias. For thus saith the king of the Assyrians: Do with me that which is for your advantage, and come out to me: and every man of you shall eat of his own vineyard, and of his own fig tree: and you shall drink water of your own cisterns,
<br>32	Till I come, and take you away, to a land, like to your own land, a fruitful land, and plen- tiful in wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olives, and oil, and honey, and you shall live, and not die. Hearken not to Ezechias, who deceiveth you, saying: The Lord will deliver us. 33 Have any of the gods of the nations de- livered their land from the hand of the king of
<br>Assyria?
<br>34	Where is the god of Emath, and of Arphad? where is the god of Sepharvaim, of Ana, and of Ava? have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?
<br>35	Who are they among all the gods of the nations that have delivered their country out of my hand, that the Lord may deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?
<br>36	But the people held their peace, and an- swered him not a word: for they had received commandment from the king that they should not answer him.
<br>37	And Eliacim, the son of Helcias, who was over the house, and Sobna, the scribe, and Joahe, the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Ezechias,
<br> 
<br>with their garments rent, and told him the words of Rabsaces.
<br>
<br>Chapter 19
<br>And when king Ezechias heard these words, he rent his garments, and covered himself with sack- cloth, and went into the house of the Lord.
<br>2	And he sent Eliacim, who was over the house, and Sobna, the scribe, and the ancients of the priests, covered with sackcloths, to Isaias, the prophet, the son of Amos.
<br>3	And they said to him: Thus saith Ezechias: This day is a day of tribulation, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy: the children are come to the birth, and the woman in travail hath not strength.
<br>4	It may be the Lord, thy God, will hear all the words of Rabsaces, whom the king of the Assyrians, his master, hath sent to reproach the living God, and to reprove with words, which the Lord, thy God, hath heard: and do thou offer prayer for the remnants that are found.
<br>5	So the servants of king Ezechias came to Isaias.
<br>6	And Isaias said to them: Thus shall you say to your master: Thus saith the Lord: Be not afraid for the words which thou hast heard, with which the servants of the king of the Assyrians have blasphemed me.
<br>7	Behold I will send a spirit upon him, and he shall hear a message, and shall return into his own country, and I will make him fall by the sword in his own country.
<br>8	And Rabsaces returned, and found the king of the Assyrians besieging Lobna: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachis.
<br>9	And when he heard of Tharaca, king of Ethiopia: Behold, he is come out to fight with
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>thee: and was going against him, he sent mes- sengers to Ezechias, saying:
<br>10	Thus shall you say to Ezechias, king of Juda: Let not thy God deceive thee, in whom thou trustest: and do not say: Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hands of the king of the Assyrians.
<br>11	Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of the Assyrians have done to all countries, how they have laid them waste: and canst thou alone be delivered?
<br>12	Have the gods of the nations delivered any of them, whom my fathers have destroyed, to wit, Gozan, and Haran, and Reseph, and the children of Eden, that were in Thelassar?
<br>13	Where is the king of Emath, and the king of Arphad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, and of Ana, and of Ava?
<br>14	And when Ezechias had received the letter of the hand of the messengers, and had read it, he went up to the house of the Lord, and spread it before the Lord,
<br>15	And he prayed in his sight, saying: O Lord God of Israel, who sittest upon the cherubims, thou alone art the God of all the kings of the earth: thou madest heaven and earth:
<br>16	Incline thy ear, and hear: open, O Lord, thy eyes and see: and hear all the words of Sen- nacherib, who hath sent to upbraid unto us the living God.
<br>17	Of a truth, O Lord, the kings of the As- syrians have destroyed nations, and the lands of them all.
<br>18	And they have cast their gods into the fire: for they were not gods, but the work of men’s hands, of wood and stone, and they destroyed them.
<br>19	Now therefore, O Lord our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the Lord, the only God.
<br> 
<br>20	And Isaias, the son of Amos, sent to Ezechias, saying: Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel: I have heard the prayer thou hast made to me concerning Sennacherib, king of the Assyr- ians.
<br>21	This is the word that the Lord hath spo- ken of him: The virgin, the daughter of Sion, hath despised thee, and laughed thee to scorn: the daughtor of Jerusalem hath wagged her head behind thy back.
<br>22	Whom hast thou reproached, and whom hast thou blasphemed? against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thy eyes on high? against the holy one of Israel.
<br>23	By the hand of thy servants thou hast re- proached the Lord, and hast said: With the mul- titude of my chariots I have gone up to the height of the mountains, to the top of Libanus, and have cut down its tall cedars, and its choice fir trees. And I have entered into the furthest parts thereof, and the forest of its Carmel.
<br>24	I have cut down, and I have drunk strange waters, and have dried up with the soles of my feet all the shut up waters.
<br>25	Hast thou not heard what I have done from the beginning? from the days of old I have formed it, and now I have brought it to effect: that fenced cities of fighting men should be turned to heaps of ruins:
<br>26	And the inhabitants of them were weak of hand, they trembled and were confounded, they became like the grass of the field, and the green herb on the tops of houses, which withered before it came to maturity.
<br>27	Thy dwelling, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy way I knew before, and thy rage against me.
<br>28	Thou hast been mad against me, and thy pride hath come up to my ears: therefore I will put a ring in thy nose, and a bit between thy lips,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.
<br>29	And to thee, O Ezechias, this shall be a sign: Eat this year what thou shalt find: and in the second year, such things as spring of them- selves: but in the third year sow and reap: plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.
<br>30	And whatsoever shall be left of the house of Juda, shall take root downward, and bear fruit upward.
<br>31	For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a rem- nant, and that which shall be saved out of mount Sion: the zeal of the Lord of hosts shall do this.
<br>32	Wherefore thus saith the Lord concerning the king of the Assyrians: He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow into it, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a trench about it.
<br>33	By the way that he came he shall return: and into this city he shall not come, saith the Lord.
<br>34	And I will protect this city, and will save it for my own sake, and for David, my servant’s sake.
<br>35	And it came to pass that night, that an angel of the Lord came, and slew in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty-five thou- sand. And when he arose early in the morning, he saw all the bodies of the dead.
<br>36	And Sennacherib, king of the Assyrians, departing, went away, and he returned and abode in Ninive.
<br>37	And as he was worshipping in the temple of Nesroch, his god, Adramelech and Sarasar, his sons, slew him with the sword, and they fled into the land of the Armenians, and Asarhaddon, his son, reigned in his stead.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 20
<br>In those days Ezechias was sick unto death: and Isaias, the son of Amos, the prophet, came and said to him: Thus saith the Lord God: Give charge concerning thy house, for thou shalt die, and not llve.
<br>2	And he turned his face to the wall, and prayed to the Lord, saying:
<br>3	I beseech thee, O Lord, remember how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is pleasing be- fore thee. And Ezechias wept with much weep- ing.
<br>4	And before Isaias was gone out of the middle of the court, the word of the Lord came to him, saying:
<br>5	Go back, and tell Ezechias, the captain of my people: Thus saith the Lord, the God of David, thy father: I have heard thy prayer, and I have seen thy tears: and behold I have healed thee: on the third day thou shalt go up to the temple of the Lord.
<br>6	And I will add to thy days fifteen years: and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of the Assyrians, and I will protect this city for my own sake, and for David, my servant’s sake.
<br>7	And Isaias said: Bring me a lump of figs. And when they had brought it, and laid it upon his boil, he was healed.
<br>8	And Ezechias had said to Isaias: What shall be the sign that the Lord will heal me, and that I will go up to the temple of the Lord the third day?
<br>9	And Isaias said to him: This shall be the sign from the Lord, that the Lord will do the word which he hath spoken: Wilt thou that the shadow go forward ten lines, or that it go back so many degrees?
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>10	And Ezechias said: It is an easy matter for the shadow to go forward ten lines: and I do not desire that this be done, but let it return back ten degrees.
<br>11	And Isaias, the prophet, called upon the Lord, and he brought the shadow ten degrees backwards by the lines, by which it had already gone down on the dial of Achaz.
<br>12	At that time Berodach Baladan, the son of Baladan, king of the Babylonians, sent letters and presents to Ezechias: for he had heard that Ezechias had been sick.
<br>13	And Ezechias rejoiced at their coming, and he shewed them the house of his aromatical spices, and the gold, and the silver, and divers precious odours, and ointments, and the house of his vessels, and all that he had in his trea- sures. There was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominions, that Ezechias shewed them not.
<br>14	And Isaias, the prophet, came to king Ezechias, and said to him: What said these men? or from whence came they to thee? And Ezechias said to him: From a far country, they came to me out of Babylon.
<br>15	And he said: What did they see in thy house? Ezechias said: They saw all the things that are in my house: There is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them.
<br>16	And Isaias said to Ezechias: Hear the word of the Lord.
<br>17	Behold the days shall come, that all that is in thy house, and that thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day, shall be carried into Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the Lord.
<br>18	And of thy sons also that shall issue from thee, whom thou shalt beget, they shall take away, and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.
<br>19	Ezechias said to Isaias: The word of the Lord, which thou hast spoken, is good: let peace
<br> 
<br>and truth be in my days.
<br>20	And the rest of the acts of Ezechias, and all his might, and how he made a pool, and a conduit, and brought waters into the city, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Juda?
<br>21	And Ezechias slept with his fathers, and Manasses, his son reigned in his stead.
<br>
<br>Chapter 21
<br>Manasses was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned five and fifty years in Jerusalem: the name of his mother was Haph- siba.
<br>2	And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, according to the idols of the nations, which the Lord destroyed from before the face of the chil- dren of Israel.
<br>3	And he turned, and built up the high places, which Ezechias, his father, had destroyed: and he set  up altars  to Baal, and  made groves, as Achab, the king of Israel, had done: and he adored all the host of heaven, and served them. 4 And he built altars in the house of the Lord, of which the Lord said: In Jerusalem I will put
<br>my name.
<br>5	And he built altars for all the host of heaven, in the two courts of the temple of the Lord.
<br>6	And he made his son pass through fire: and he used divinations, and observed omens, and appointed pythons, and multiplied soothsayers, to do evil before the Lord, and to provoke him. 7 He set also an idol of the grove, which he had made, in the temple of the Lord: concerning which the Lord said to David, and to Solomon his son: In this temple, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will
<br>put my name for ever.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>8	And I will no more make the feet of Israel to be moved out of the land, which I gave to their fathers: only if they will observe to do all that I have commanded them, according to the law which my servant Moses commanded them.
<br>9	But they hearkened not: but were seduced by Manasses, to do evil more than the nations which the Lord destroyed before the children of Israel.
<br>10	And the Lord spoke in the hand of his ser- vants, the prophets, saying:
<br>11	Because Manasses, king of Juda, hath done these most wicked abominations, beyond all that the Amorrhites did before him, and hath made Juda also to sin with his filthy doings:
<br>12	Therefore thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring on evils upon Jerusalem and Juda: that whosoever shall hear of them, both his ears shall tingle.
<br>13	And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the weight of the house of Achab: and I will efface Jerusalem, as writings tables are wont to be effaced, and I will erase and turn it, and draw the pencil often over the face thereof. 14 And I will leave the remnants of my inher- itance, and will deliver them into the hands of their enemies: and they shall become a prey, and
<br>a spoil to all their enemies.
<br>15	Because they have done evil before me, and have continued to provoke me, from the day that their fathers came out of Egypt, even unto this day.
<br>16	Moreover, Manasses shed also very much innocent blood, till he filled Jerusalem up to the mouth: besides his sins, wherewith he made Juda to sin, to do evil before the Lord.
<br>17	Now the rest of the acts of Manasses, and all that he did, and his sin, which he sinned, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Juda?
<br> 
<br>18	And Manasses slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Oza: and Amon, his son, reigned in his stead.
<br>19	Two and twenty years old was Amon when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem: the name of his mother was Mes- salemeth, the daughter of Harus, of Jeteba.
<br>20	And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, as Manasses, his father, had done.
<br>21	And he walked in all the way in which his father had walked: and he served the abomina- tions which his father had served, and he adored them.
<br>22	And forsook the Lord, the God of his fa- thers, and walked not in the way of the Lord.
<br>23	And his servants plotted against him, and slew the king in his own house.
<br>24	But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon: and made Josias, his son, their king in his stead.
<br>25	But the rest of the acts of Amon, which he did, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Juda?
<br>26	And they buried him in his sepulchre, in the garden of Oza: and his son, Josias, reigned in his stead.
<br>
<br>Chapter 22
<br>Josias was eight years old when he began to reign: he reigned one and thirty years in Jerusalem: the name of his mother was Idida, the daughter of Hadaia, of Besecath.
<br>2	And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, and walked in all the ways of David, his father: he turned not aside to the right hand, or to the left.
<br>3	And in the eighteenth year of king Josias,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>the king sent Saphan, the son of Assia, the son of Messulam, the scribe of the temple of the Lord, saying to him:
<br>5	And let it be given to the workmen by the overseers of the house of the Lord: and let them distribute it to those that work in the temple of the Lord, to repair the temple:
<br>6	That is, to carpenters and masons, and to such as mend breaches: and that timber may be bought, and stones out of the quarries, to repair the temple of the Lord.
<br>7	But let there be no reckoning made with them of the money which they receive, but let them have it in their power, and in their trust.
<br>8	And Helcias, the high priest, said to Saphan, the scribe: I have found the book of the law in the house of the Lord: and Helcias gave the book to Saphan, and he read it.
<br>9	And Saphan, the scribe, came to the king, and brought him word again concerning that which he had commanded, and said: Thy ser- vants have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the Lord: and they have given it to be distributed to the workmen, by the overseers of the works of the temple of the Lord. 10 And Saphan, the scribe, told the king, say- ing: Helcias, the priest, hath delivered to me a book. And when Saphan had read it before the
<br>king,
<br>11	And the king had heard the words of the law of the Lord, he rent his garments.
<br>12	And he commanded Helcias, the priest, and Ahicam, the son of Saphan, and Achobor, the son of Micha, and Saphan, the scribe, and Asaia, the king’s servant, saying:
<br>13	Go and consult the Lord for me, and for the people, and for all Juda, concerning the words of this book which is found: for the great wrath of the Lord is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened to the words of this
<br> 
<br>book, to do all that is written for us.
<br>14	So Helcias, the priest, and Ahicam, and Achobor, and Sapham, and Asaia, went to Holda, the prophetess, the wife of Sellum, the son of Thecua, the son of Araas, keeper of the wardrobe, who dwelt in Jerusalem, in the Sec- ond: and they spoke to her.
<br>15	And she said to them: Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel: Tell the man that sent you to me:
<br>16	Thus saith the Lord: Behold, I will bring evils upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, all the words of the law which the king of Juda hath read:
<br>17	Because they have forsaken me, and have sacrificed to strange gods, provoking me by all the works of their hands: therefore my indigna- tion shall be kindled against this place, and shall not be quenched.
<br>18	But to the king of Juda, who sent you to consult the Lord, thus shall you say: Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel: for as much as thou hast heard the words of the book,
<br>19	And thy heart hath been moved to fear, and thou hast humbled thyself before the Lord, hearing the words against this place, and the in- habitants thereof, to wit, that they should be- come a wonder and a curse: and thou hast rent thy garments, and wept before me; I also have heard thee; saith the Lord.
<br>20	Therefore I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy sepulchre in peace; that thy eyes may not see all the evils which I will bring upon this place.
<br>
<br>Chapter 23
<br>And they brought the king word again what she had said. And he sent: and all the ancients of
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Juda and Jerusalem were assembled to him.
<br>2	And the king went up to the temple of the Lord, and all the men of Juda, and all the inhab- itants of Jerusalem with him, the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both little and great: and in the hearing of them all he read all the words of the book of the covenant, which was found in the house of the Lord.
<br>3	And the king stood upon the step: and he made a covenant with the Lord, to walk after the Lord, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his ceremonies, with all their heart, and with all their soul, and to perform the words of this covenant, which were writ- ten in that book: and the people agreed to the covenant.
<br>4	And the king commanded Helcias, the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the doorkeepers, to cast out of the temple of the Lord all the vessels that had been made for Baal, and for the grove, and for all the host of heaven: and he burnt them without Jerusalem, in the val- ley of Cedron, and he carried the ashes of them to Bethel.
<br>5	And he destroyed the soothsayers, whom the kings of Juda had appointed to sacrifice in the high places in the cities of Juda, and round about Jerusalem: them also that burnt incense to Baal, and to the sun, and to the moon, and to the twelve signs, and to all the host of heaven.
<br>6	And he caused the grove to be carried out from the house of the Lord, without Jerusalem, to the valley of Cedron, and he burnt it there, and reduced it to dust, and cast the dust upon the graves of the common people.
<br>7	He destroyed also the pavilions of the effem- inate, which were in the house of the Lord, for which the women wove as it were little dwellings for the grove.
<br>8	And he gathered together all the priests out
<br> 
<br>of the cities of Juda: and he defiled the high places, where the priests offered sacrifice, from Gabaa to Bersabee: and he broke down thc al- tars of the gates that were in the entering in of the gate of Josue, governor of the city, which was on the left hand of the gate of the city.
<br>9	However, the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the Lord, in Jerusalem: but only eat of the unleavened bread among their brethren.
<br>10	And he defiled Topheth, which is in the val- ley of the son of Ennom: that no man should con- secrate there his son, or his daughter, through fire, to Moloch.
<br>11	And he took away the horses which the kings of Juda had given to the sun, at the en- tering in of the temple of the Lord, near the chamber of Nathanmelech the eunuch, who was in Pharurim: and he burnt the chariots of the sun with fire.
<br>12	And the altars that were upon the top of the upper chamber of Achaz, which the kings of Juda had made, and the altars which Man- asses had made in the two courts of the temple of the Lord, the king broke down: and he ran from thence, and cast the ashes of them into the torrent Cedron.
<br>13	The high places also that were at Jerusalem, on the right side of the Mount of Of- fence, which Solomon, king of Israel, had built to Astaroth, the idol of the Sidonians, and to Chamos, the scandal of Moab, and to Melchom, the abomination of the children of Ammon, the king defiled.
<br>14	And he broke in pieces the statues, and cut down the groves: and he filled their places with the bones of dead men.
<br>15	Moreover, the altar also that was at Bethel, and the high place, which Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, who made Israel to sin, had made: both
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>the altar, and the high place, he broke down and burnt, and reduced to powder, and burnt the grove.
<br>16	And as Josias turned himself, he saw there the sepulchres that were in the mount: and he sent and took the bones out of the sepulchres, and burnt them upon the altar, and defiled it ac- cording to the word of the Lord, which the man of God spoke, who had foretold these things.
<br>17	And he said: What is that monument which I see? And the men of that city answered: It is the sepulchre of the man of God, who came from Juda, and foretold these things which thou hast done upon the altar of Bethel.
<br>18	And he said: Let him alone, let no man move his bones. So his bones were left untouched with the bones of the prophet, that came out of Samaria.
<br>19	Moreover all the temples of the high places which were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the Lord, Josias took away: and he did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel.
<br>20	And he slew all the priests of the high places, that were there, upon the altars; and he burnt men’s bones upon them: and returned to Jerusalem.
<br>21	And he commanded all the people, saying: Keep the Phase to the Lord your God, according as it is written in the book of this covenant.
<br>22	Now there was no such a Phase kept from the days of the judges, who judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, and of the kings of Juda,
<br>23	As was this Phase, that was kept to the Lord in Jerusalem, in the eighteenth year of king Josias.
<br>24	Moreover the diviners by spirits, and sooth- sayers, and the figures of idols, and the unclean- nesses, and the abominations, that had been
<br> 
<br>in the land of Juda and Jerusalem, Josias took away: that he might perform the words of the law, that were written in the book, which Hel- cias the priest had found in the temple of the Lord.
<br>25	There was no king before him like unto him, that returned to the Lord with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his strength, according to all the law of Moses: neither after him did there arise any like unto him.
<br>26	But yet the Lord turned not away from the wrath of his great indignation, wherewith his anger was kindled against Juda: because of the provocations, wherewith Manasses had provoked him.
<br>27	And the Lord said: I will remove Juda also from before my face, as I have removed Israel: and I will cast off this city Jerusalem, which I chose, and the house, of which I said: My name shall be there.
<br>28	Now the rest of the acts of Josias, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Juda?
<br>29	In his days Pharao Nechao, king of Egypt, went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josias went to meet him: and was slain at Mageddo, when he had seen him.
<br>30	And his servants carried him dead from Mageddo: and they brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulchre. And the people of the land took Joachaz, the son of Josias: and they anointed him, and made him king in his father’s stead.
<br>31	Joachaz was three and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem: the name of his mother was Amital, the daughter of Jeremias, of Lobna. 32 And he did evil before the Lord, according
<br>to all that his fathers had done.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>33	And Pharao Nechao bound him at Rebla, which is in the land of Emath, that he should not reign in Jerusalem: and he set a fine upon the land, of a hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.
<br>34	And Pharao Nechao made Eliacim, the son of Josias, king in the room of Josias his father: and turned his name to Joakim. And he took Joachaz away and carried him into Egypt, and he died there.
<br>35	And Joakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharao, after he had taxed the land for every man, to contribute according to the command- ment of Pharao: and he exacted both the silver and the gold of the people of the land, of every man according to his ability: to give to Pharao Nechao.
<br>36	Joakim was five and twenty years old when he began to reign: and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: the name of his mother was Zebida, the daughter of Phadaia, of Ruma.
<br>37	And he did evil before the Lord according to all that his fathers had done.
<br>
<br>Chapter 24
<br>In his days Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon came up, and Joakim became his servant three years: then again he rebelled against him.
<br>2	And the Lord sent against him the rovers of the Chaldees, and the rovers of Syria, and the rovers of Moab, and the rovers of the children of Ammon: and he sent them against Juda, to de- stroy it, according to the word of the Lord, which he had spoken by his servants, the prophets.
<br>3	And this came by the word of the Lord against Juda, to remove them from before him for all the sins of Manasses which he did;
<br>4	And for the innocent blood that he shed,
<br> 
<br>filling Jerusalem with innocent blood: and there- fore the Lord would not be appeased.
<br>5	But the rest of the acts of Joakim, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Juda? And Joakim slept with his fathers:
<br>6	And Joachin, his son, reigned in his stead.
<br>7	And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his own country: for the king of Babylon had taken all that had belonged to the king of Egypt, from the river of Egypt, unto the river Euphrates.
<br>8	Joachin was eighteen years old when he be- gan to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem: the name of his mother was Nohesta, the daughter of Elnathan, of Jerusalem.
<br>9	And he did evil before the Lord, according to all that his father had done.
<br>10	At that time the servants of Nabu- chodonosor, king of Babylon, came up against Jerusalem, and the city was surrounded with their forts.
<br>11	And Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon, came to the city, with his servants, to assault it.
<br>12	And Joachin, king of Juda, went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his nobles, and his eunuchs: and the king of Babylon received him in the eighth year of his reign.
<br>13	And he brought out from thence all the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the trea- sures of the king’s house: and he cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon, king of Israel, had made in the temple of the Lord, according to the word of the Lord.
<br>14	And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the valiant men of the army, to the number of ten thousand, into captivity: and every artificer and smith: and none were
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>left, but the poor sort of the people of the land. 15 And he carried away Joachin into Babylon, and the king’s mother, and the king’s wives, and his eunuchs: and the judges of the land he car- ried into captivity, from Jerusalem, into Baby-
<br>lon.
<br>16 And all the strong men, seven thousand, and the artificers, and the smiths, a thousand, all that were valiant men, and fit for war: and the king of Babylon led them captives into Babylon. 17 And  he appointed Matthanias, his uncle,
<br>in his stead: and called his name Sedecias.
<br>18	Sedecias was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: the name of his mother was Amital, the daughter of Jeremias, of Lobna.
<br>19	And he did evil before the Lord, according to all that Joakim had done.
<br>20	For the Lord was angry against Jerusalem and against Juda, till he cast them out from his face: and Sedecias revolted from the king of Babylon.
<br>
<br>Chapter 25
<br>And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, the tenth day of the month, that Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon, came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem: and they surrounded it: and raised works round about it. 2 And the city was shut up and besieged till
<br>the eleventh year of king Sedecias,
<br>3	The ninth day of the month: and a famine prevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land.
<br>4	And a breach was made into the city: and all the men of war fled in the night between the two walls by the king’s garden (now the Chaldees besieged the city round about), and Sedecias fled
<br> 
<br>by the way that leadeth to the plains of the wilderness.
<br>5	And the army of the Chaldees pursued af- ter the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho: and all the warriors that were with him were scattered, and left him:
<br>6	So they took the king, and brought him to the king of Babylon, to Reblatha, and he gave judgment upon him.
<br>7	And he slew the sons of Sedecias before his face, and he put out his eyes, and bound him with chains, and brought him to Babylon.
<br>8	In the fifth month, the seventh day of the month, the same is the nineteenth year of the king of Babylon, came Nabuzardan, commander of the army, a servant of the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem.
<br>9	And he burnt the house of the Lord, and the king’s house, and the houses of Jerusalem, and every great house he burnt with fire.
<br>10	And all the army of the Chaldees, which was with the commander of the troops, broke down the walls of Jerusalem round about.
<br>11	And Nabuzardan, the commander of the army, carried away the rest of the people, that remained in the city, and the fugitives, that had gone over to the king of Babylon, and the rem- nant of the common people.
<br>12	But of the poor of the land he left some dressers of vines and husbandmen.
<br>13	And the pillars of brass that were in the temple of the Lord, and the bases, and the sea of brass, which was in the house of the Lord, the Chaldees broke in pieces, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.
<br>14	They took away also the pots of brass, and the mazers, and the forks, and the cups, and the mortars, and all the vessels of brass, with which they ministered.
<br>15	Moreover also the censers, and the bowls,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>such as were of gold in gold: and such as were of silver in silver, the general of the army took away.
<br>16	That is, two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made in the temple of the Lord: the brass of all these vessels was without weight.
<br>17	One pillar was eighteen cubits high: and the chapiter of brass, which was upon it, was three cubits high: and the network, and the pomegranates that were upon the chapiter of the pillar, were all of brass: and the second pillar had the like adorning.
<br>18	And the general of the army took Sera- ias, the chief priest, and Sophonias, the second priest, and three doorkeepers:
<br>19	And out of the city one eunuch, who was captain over the men of war: and five men of them who had stood before the king, whom he found in the city, and Sopher, the captain of the army, who exercised the young soldiers of the people of the land: and threescore men of the common people, who were found in the city:
<br>20	These Nabuzardan, the general of the army, took away, and carried them to the king of Babylon, to Reblatha.
<br>21	And the king of Babylon smote them, and slew them at Reblatha, in the land of Emath: so Juda was carried away out of their land.
<br>22	But over the people that remained in the land of Juda, which Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon, had left, he gave the government to Godolias, the son of Ahicam, the son of Saphan. 23 And when all the captains of the soldiers had heard this, they and the men that were with them, to wit, that the king of Babylon had made Godolias governor they came to Godolias to Maspha, Ismael, the son of Nathanias, and Jo- hanan, the son of Caree, and Saraia, the son of Thanehumeth, the Netophathite, and Jezonias,
<br> 
<br>the son of Maachathi, they and their men.
<br>24	And Godolias swore to them and to their men, saying: Be not afraid to serve the Chaldees: stay in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.
<br>25	But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ismael, the son of Nathanias, the son of Elisama, of the seed royal came, and ten men with him, and smote Godolias; so that he died: and also the Jews and the Chaldees that were with him in Maspha.
<br>26	And all the people, both little and great, and the captains of the soldiers, rising up, went to Egypt, fearing the Chaldees.
<br>27	And it came to pass in the seven and thirti- eth year of the captivity of Joachin, king of Juda, in the twelfth month, the seven and twentieth day of the month: Evilmerodach, king of Baby- lon, in the year that he began to reign, lifted up the head of Joachin, king of Juda, out of prison. 28 And he spoke kindly to him: and he set his throne above the throne of the kings that were
<br>with him in Babylon.
<br>29	And he changed his garments which he had in prison, and he ate bread always before him, all the days of his life.
<br>30	And he appointed him a continual al- lowance, which was also given him by the king, day by day, all the days of his life.

<br>22	And he that made the sun to stand, and the men of Lying, and Secure, and Burning, who
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>were princes in Moab, and who returned into Lahem. Now these are things of old.
<br>23	These are the potters, and they dwelt in Plantations, and Hedges, with the king for his works, and they abode there.

<br>27	The sons of Semei were sixteen, and six daughters: but his brethren had not many sons, and the whole kindred could not reach to the sum of the children of Juda.
<br>28	And they dwelt in Bersabee, and Molada, and Hasarsuhal,

<br>30	And in Bathuel, and in Horma, and in Sice- leg,

<br> 
<br>39	And they went forth to enter into Gador as far as to the east side of the valley, to seek pastures for their flocks.
<br>40	And they found fat pastures, and very good, and a country spacious, and quiet, and fruitful, in which some of the race of Cham had dwelt before.
<br>41	And these whose names are written above, came in the days of Ezechias king of Juda: and they beat down their tents, and slew the inhab- itants that were found there, and utterly de- stroyed them unto this day: and they dwelt in their place, because they found there fat pas- tures.
<br>42	Some also of the children of Simeon, five hundred men, went into mount Seir, having for their captains Phaltias and Naaria and Raphaia and Oziel the sons of Jesi:
<br>43	And they slew the remnant of the Amale- cites, who had been able to escape, and they dwelt there in their stead unto this day.
<br>
<br>Chapter 5
<br>Now the sons of Ruben the firstborn of Israel, (for he was his firstborn: but forasmuch as he defiled his father’s bed, his first birthright was given to the sons of Joseph the son of Israel, and he was not accounted for the firstborn.
<br>2 But of the race of Juda, who was the strongest among his brethren, came the princes: but the first birthright was accounted to Joseph.) 3 The sons then of Ruben the firstborn of Is- rael were Enoch, and Phallu, Esron, and Charmi. 4 The sons of Joel: Samaia his son, Gog his
<br>son, Semei his son,
<br>5	Micha his son, Reia his son, Baal his son,
<br>6	Beera his son, whom Thelgathphalnasar king of the Assyrians carried away captive, and
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>he was prince in the tribe of Ruben.
<br>7	And his brethren, and all his kindred, when they were numbered by their families, had for princes Jehiel, and Zacharias.
<br>8	And Bala the son of Azaz, the son of Samma, the son of Joel, dwelt in Aroer as far as Nebo, and Beelmeon.
<br>9	And eastward he had his habitation as far as the entrance of the desert, and the river Eu- phrates. For they possessed a great number of cattle in the land of Galaad.
<br>10	And in the days of Saul they fought against the Agarites, and slew them, and dwelt in their tents in their stead, in all the country, that looketh to the east of Galaad.
<br>11	And the children of Gad dwelt over against them in the land of Basan, as far as Selcha:
<br>12	Johel the chief, and Saphan the second: and Janai, and Saphat in Basan.
<br>13	And their brethren according to the houses of their kindreds, were Michael and Mosollam, and Sebe, and Jorai, and Jacan, and Zie, and Heber, seven.
<br>14	These were the sons of Abihail, the son of Huri, the son of Jara, the son of Galaad, the son of Michael, the son of Jesisi, the son of Jeddo, the son of Buz.
<br>15	And their brethren the sons of Abdiel, the son of Guni, chief of the house in their families, 16 And they dwelt in Galaad, and in Basan and in the towns thereof, and in all the suburbs
<br>of Saron, unto the borders.
<br>17	All these were numbered in the days of Joathan king of Juda, and in the days of Jer- oboam king of Israel.
<br>18	The Sons of Ruben, and of Gad, and of the half tribe of Manasses, fighting men, bearing shields, and swords, and bending the bow, and trained up to battles, four and forty thousand
<br> 
<br>seven hundred and threescore that went out to war.
<br>19	They fought against the Agarites: but the Itureans, and Naphis, and Nodab,
<br>20	Gave them help. And the Agarites were de- livered into their hands, and all that were with them, because they called upon God in the bat- tle: and he heard them, because they had put their faith in him.
<br>21	And they took all that they possessed, of camels fifty thousand, and of sheep two hundred and fifty thousand, and of asses two thousand, and of men a hundred thousand souls.
<br>22	And many fell down slain: for it was the battle of the Lord. And they dwelt in their stead till the captivity.
<br>23	And the children of the half tribe of Man- asses possessed the land, from the borders of Basan unto Baal, Hermon, and Sanir, and mount Hermon, for their number was great.
<br>24	And these were the heads of the house of their kindred, Epher, and Jesi, and Eliel, and Esriel, and Jeremia, and Odoia, and Jediel, most valiant and powerful men, and famous chiefs in their families.
<br>25	But they forsook the God of their fathers, and went astray after the gods of the people of the land, whom God destroyed before them.
<br>26	And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Phul king of the Assyrians. and the spirit of Thelgathphalnasar king of Assur: and he car- ried away Ruben, and Gad, and the half tribe of Manasses, and brought them to Lahela, and to Habor, and to Ara, and to the river of Gozan, unto this day.

<br>14	And of the Levites: Semeia the son of Has- sub the son of Ezricam, the son of Hasebia of the sons of Merari.
<br>15	And Bacbacar the carpenter, and Galal, and Mathania the son of Micha, the son of Zechri the son of Asaph:
<br>16	And Obdia the son of Semeia, the son of Galal, the son of Idithum: and Barachia the son of Asa, the son of Elcana, who dwelt in the sub- urbs of Netophati.
<br>17	And the porters were Sellum, and Accub, and Telmon, and Ahiman: and their brother Sel- lum was the prince,
<br>18	Until that time, in the king’s gate eastward, the sons of Levi waited by their turns.
<br>19	But Sellum the son of Core, the son of Abi- asaph, the son of Core, with his brethren and his father’s house, the Corites were over the works of the service, keepers of the gates of the taber- nacle: and their families in turns were keepers of the entrance of the camp of the Lord.
<br>20	And Phinees the son of Eleazar, was their prince before the Lord,
<br>21	And Zacharias the son of Mosollamia, was porter of the gate of the tabernacle of the testi- mony:
<br>22	All these that were chosen to be porters at the gates, were two hundred and twelve: the they were registered in their proper towns: whom
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>David and Samuel the seer appointed in their trust.
<br>23	As well them as their sons, to keep the gates of the house of the Lord, and the taberna- cle by their turns.
<br>24	In four quarters were the porters: that is to say, toward the east, and west, and north, and south.
<br>25	And their brethren dwelt  in village, and came upon their sabbath days from time to time. 26 To these four Levites were committed the whole number of the porters, and they were over the chambers, and treasures, of the house of the
<br>Lord.
<br>27 And they abode in their watches round about the temple of the Lord: that when it was time, they might open the gates in the morning. 28 And some of their stock had the charge of the vessels for the ministry: for the vessels were
<br>both brought in and carried out by number.
<br>29	Some of them also had the instruments of the sanctuary committed unto them, and the charge of the fine flour, and wine, and oil, and frankincense, and spices.
<br>30	And the sons of the priests made the oint- ments of the spices.
<br>31	And Mathathias a Levite, the firstborn of Sellum the Corite, was overseer of such things as were fried the fryingpan.
<br>32	And some of the sons of Caath their brethren, were over the loaves of proposition, to prepare always new for every sabbath.
<br>33	These are the chief of the singing men of the families of the Levites, who dwelt in the cham- bers, by the temple, that they might serve con- tinually day and night in their ministry.
<br>34	The heads of the Levites, princes in their families, abode in Jerusalem.
<br>35	And in Gabaon dwelt Jehiel the father of Gabaon, and the name of his wife was Maacha:
<br> 
<br>36	His firstborn son Abdon, and Sur, and Cis, and Baal, and Ner, and Nadab,
<br>37	Gedor also, and Ahio, and Zacharias, and Macelloth.
<br>38	And Macelloth begot Samaan: these dwelt over against their brethren in Jerusalem, with their brethren.
<br>39	Now Ner begot Cis: and Cis begot Saul: and Saul begot Jonathan and Melchisua, and Abinadab, and Esbaal.
<br>40	And the son of Jonathan, was Meribbaal: and Meribbaal begot Micha.
<br>41	And the sons of Micha, were Phithon, and Melech, and Tharaa, and Ahaz.
<br>42	And Ahaz begot Jara, and Jara begot Ala- math, and Azmoth, and Zamri. And Zamri be- got Mosa.
<br>43	And Mosa begot Banaa: whose son Raphaia begot Elasa:  of whom was born Asel.
<br>44	And Asel had six sons whose names are, Ezricam Bochru, Ismahel, Saria, Obdia, Hanan: these are the sons of Asel.
<br>
<br>Chapter 10
<br>Now the Philistines fought against Israel, and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down wounded in mount Gelboe.
<br>2	And the Philistines drew near pursuing after Saul, and his sons, and they killed Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Melchisua the sons of Saul.
<br>3	And the battle grew hard against Saul and the archers reached him, and wounded him with arrows.
<br>4	And Saul said to his armourbearer: Draw thy sword, and kill me: lest these uncircum- cised come, and mock me. But his armourbearer would not, for he was struck with fear: so Saul took his sword, and fell upon it.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>5	And when his armourbearer saw it, to wit, that Saul was dead, he also fell upon his sword and died.
<br>6	So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house fell together.
<br>7	And when the men of Israel, that dwelt in the plains, saw this, they fled: and Saul and his sons being dead, they forsook their cities, and were scattered up and down: and the Philistines came, and dwelt in them.
<br>8	And the next day the Philistines taking away the spoils of them that were slain, found Saul and his sons lying on mount Gelboe.
<br>9	And when they had stripped him, and out off his head, and taken away his armour, they sent it into their land, to be carried about, and shewn in the temples of the idols and to the people.
<br>10	And his armour they dedicated in the tem- ple of their god, and his head they fastened up in the temple of Dagon.
<br>11	And when the men of Jabes Galaad had heard this, to wit, all that the Philistines had done to Saul,
<br>12	All the valiant men of them arose, and took the bodies of Saul and of his sons, and brought them to Jabes, and buried their bones under the oak that was in Jabes, and they fasted seven days.
<br>13	So Saul died for his iniquities, because he transgressed the commandment of the Lord, which he had commanded, and kept it not: and moreover consulted also a witch,
<br>14	And trusted not in the Lord: therefore he slew him, and transferred his kingdom to David the son of Isai.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 11
<br>
<br>Then all Israel gathered themselves to David in Hebron, saying: We are thy bone, and thy flesh.
<br>2	Yesterday also, and the day before when Saul was king, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: for the Lord thy God said to thee: Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over them.
<br>3	So all the ancients of Israel came to the king to Hebron, and David made a covenant with them before the Lord: and they anointed him king over Israel according to the word of the Lord which he spoke in the hand of Samuel.
<br>4	And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus, where the Jebusites were the in- habitants of the land.
<br>5	And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David: Thou shalt not come in here. But David took the castle of Sion, which is the city of David.
<br>6	And he said: Whosoever shall first strike the Jebusites, shall be the head and chief captain. And Joab the son of Sarvia went up first, and was made the general.
<br>7	And David dwelt in the castle, and therefore it was called the city of David,
<br>8	And he built the city round about from Mello all round, and Joab built the rest of the city.
<br>9	And David went on growing and increasing, and the Lord of hosts was with him.
<br>10	These are the chief of the valiant man of David, who helped him to be made king over all Israel, according to the word of the Lord, which he spoke to Israel.
<br>11	And this is the number of the heroes of David: Jesbaam the son of Hachamoni the chief among the thirty: he lifted up his spear against three hundred wounded by him at one time.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>12	And after him was Eleazar his uncle’s son the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighties. 13 He was with David in Phesdomim, when the Philistines were gathered to that place to battle: and the field of that country was full of barley, and the people fled from before the
<br>Philistines.
<br>14	But these men stood in the midst of the field, and defended it: and they slew the Philistines, and the Lord gave a great deliver- ance to his people.
<br>15	And three of the thirty captains went down to the rock, wherein David was, to the cave of Odollam, when the Philistines encamped in the valley of Raphaim.
<br>16	And David was in a hold, and the garrison of the Philistines in Bethlehem.
<br>17	And David longed, and said: O that some man would give me water of the cistern of Beth- lehem, which is in the gate.
<br>18	And these three broke through the midst of the camp of the Philistines, and drew water out of the cistern of Bethlehem, which was in the gate, and brought it to David to drink: and he would not drink of it, but rather offered it to the Lord,
<br>19	Saying: God forbid that I should do this in the sight of my God, and should drink the blood of these men: for with the danger of their lives they have brought me the water. And therefore he would not drink. These things did the three most valiant.
<br>20	And Abisai the brother of Joab, he was chief of three, and he lifted up his spear against three hundred whom he slew, and he was renowned among the three,
<br>21	And illustrious among the second three, and their captain: but yet he attained not to the first three.
<br>22	Banaias the son of Joiada a most valiant
<br> 
<br>man, of Cabseel, who had done many acts: he slew the two ariels of Moab: and he went down, and killed a lion in the midst of a pit in the time of snow.
<br>23	And he slew an Egyptian, whose stature was of five cubits, and who had a spear like a weaver’s beam: and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked away the spear, that he held in his hand, and slew him with his own spear.
<br>24	These things did Banaias the son of Joiada, who was renowned among the three valiant ones, 25 And the first among the thirty, but yet to the three he attained not: and David made him
<br>of his council.
<br>26	Moreover the most valiant men of the army, were Asahel brother of Joab, and Elchanan the son of his uncle of Bethlehem,
<br>27	Sammoth an Arorite, Helles a Phalonite,
<br>28	Ira the son of Acces a Thecuite, Abiezer an Anathothite,
<br>29	Sobbochai a Husathite, Ilai an Ahohite,
<br>30	Maharai a Netophathite, Heled the son of Baana a Netophathite,
<br>31	Ethai the son of Ribai of Gabaath of the sons of Benjamin, Banai a Pharathonite,
<br>32	Hurai of the torrent Gaas, Abiel an Ar- bathite, Azmoth a Bauramite, Eliaba a Sal- abonite,
<br>33	The sons of Assem a Gezonite, Jonathan the son of Sage an Ararite,
<br>34	Ahiam the son of Sachar an Ararite,
<br>35	Eliphal the son of Ur,
<br>36	Hepher a Mecherathite, Ahia a Phelonite, 37 Hesro a Carmelite, Naarai the son of Azbai, 38 Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibahar the
<br>son of Agarai.
<br>39	Selec an Ammonite, Naharai a Berothite, the armourbearer of Joab the son of Sarvia.
<br>40	Ira a Jethrite, Gareb a Jethrite,
<br>41	Urias a Hethite, Zabad the son of Oholi,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>42	Adina the son of Siza a Rubenite the prince of the Rubenites, and thirty with him:
<br>43	Hanan the son of Maacha, and Josaphat a Mathanite,
<br>44	Ozia an Astarothite, Samma, and Jehiel the sons of Hotham an Arorite,
<br>45	Jedihel the son of Zamri, and Joha his brother a Thosaite,
<br>46	Eliel a Mahumite, and Jeribai, and Josaia the sons of Elnaim, and Jethma a Moabite, Eliel, and Obed, and Jasiel of Masobia.
<br>
<br>Chapter 12
<br>Now these are they that came to David to Sice- leg, while he yet fled from Saul the son of Cis, and they were most valiant and excellent war- riors,
<br>2	Bending the bow, and using either hand in hurling stones with slings, and shooting arrows: of the brethren of Saul of Benjamin.
<br>3	The chief was Ahiezer, and Joas, the sons of Samoa of Gabaath, and Jaziel, and Phallet the sons of Azmoth, and Beracha, and Jehu an Anathothite.
<br>4	And Samaias of Gabaon, the stoutest amongst the thirty and over the thirty; Jeremias, and Jeheziel and Johanan, and Jozabad of Gaderoth;
<br>5	And Eluzai, and Jerimuth, and Baalia, and Samaria, and Saphatia the Haruphite;
<br>6	Elcana, and Jesia, and Azareel, and Joezer, and Jesbaam of Carehim:
<br>7	And Joela, and Zabadia the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.
<br>8	From Gaddi also there went over to David, when he lay hid in the wilderness most valiant men, and excellent warriors, holding shield and spear: whose faces were like the faces of a lion,
<br> 
<br>and they were swift like the roebucks on the mountains.
<br>9	Ezer the chief, Obdias the second, Eliab the third,
<br>10	Masmana the fourth, Jeremias the fifth,
<br>11	Ethi the sixth, Eliel the seventh,
<br>12	Johanan the eighth, Elzebad the ninth, 13 Jerenias the tenth, Machbani the eleventh, 14 These were of the sons of Gad, captains of
<br>the army: the least of them was captain over a hundred soldiers, and the greatest over a thou- sand.
<br>15	These are they who passed over the Jordan in the first month, when it is used to flow over its banks: and they put to flight all that dwelt in the valleys both toward the east and toward the west.
<br>16	And there came also of the men of Ben- jamin, and of Juda to the hold, in which David abode.
<br>17	And David went out to meet them, and said: If you are come peaceably to me to help me, let my heart be joined to you: but if you plot against me for my enemies whereas I have no iniquity in my hands, let the God of our fathers see, and judge.
<br>18	But the spirit came upon Amasai the chief among thirty, and he said: We are thine, O David, and for thee, O son of Isai: peace, peace be to thee, and peace to thy helpers. For thy God helpeth thee. So David received them, and made them captains of the band.
<br>19	And there were some of Manasses that went over to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to fight: but he did not fight with them: because the lords of the Philistines taking counsel sent him back, saying: With the danger of our heads he will return to his master Saul.
<br>20	So when he went back to Siceleg, there fled to him of Manasses, Ednas and Jozabad, and
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Jedihel, and Michael, and Ednas, and Jozabad, and Eliu, and Salathi, captains of thousands in Manasses.
<br>21	These helped David against the rovers: for they were all most valiant men, and were made commanders in the army.
<br>22	Moreover day by day there came some to David to help him till they became a great num- ber, like the army of God.
<br>23	And this is the number of the chiefs of the army who came to David, when he was in He- bron, to transfer to him the kingdom of Saul, according to the word of the Lord.
<br>24	The sons of Juda bearing shield and spear, six thousand eight hundred well appointed to war.
<br>25	Of the sons of Simeon valiant men for war, seven thousand one hundred.
<br>26	Of the sons of Levi, four thousand six hun- dred.
<br>27	And Joiada prince of the race of Aaron, and with him three thousand seven hundred.
<br>28	Sadoc also a young man of excellent dis- position, and the house of his father, twenty-two principal men.
<br>29	And of the sons of Benjamin the brethren of Saul, three thousand: for hitherto a great part of them followed the house of Saul.
<br>30	And of the sons of Ephraim twenty thousand eight hundred, men of great valour renowned in their kindreds.
<br>31	And of the half tribe of Manasses, eigh- teen thousand, every one by their names, came to make David king.
<br>32	Also of the sons of Issachar men of under- standing, that knew all times to order what Is- rael should do, two hundred principal men: and all the rest of the tribe followed their counsel.
<br>33	And of Zabulon such as went forth to bat- tle, and stood in array well appointed with ar-
<br> 
<br>mour for war, there came fifty thousand to his aid, with no double heart.
<br>34	And of Nephtali, a thousand leaders: and with them seven and thirty thousand, furnished with shield and spear.
<br>35	Of Dan also twenty-eight thousand six hun- dred prepared for battle.
<br>36	And of Aser forty thousand going forth to fight, and challenging in battle.
<br>37	And on the other side of the Jordan of the sons of Ruben, and of Gad, and of the half of the tribe of Manasses a hundred and twenty thou- sand, furnished with arms for war.
<br>38	All these men of war well appointed to fight, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel: and all the rest also of Israel, were of one heart to make David king.
<br>39	And they were there with David three days eating and drinking: for their brethren had pre- pared for them.
<br>40	Moreover they that were near them even as far as Issachar, and Zabulon, and Nephtali, brought loaves on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, to eat: meal, figs, raisins, wine, oil, and oxen, and sheep in abundance, for there was joy in Israel.
<br>
<br>Chapter 13
<br>
<br>David consulted with the captains of thousands, and of hundreds, and with all the commanders. 2 And he said to all the assembly of Israel: If it please you; and if the words which I speak come from the Lord our God, let us send to the rest of our brethren into all the countries of Israel, and to the priests, and the Levites, that dwell in the suburbs of the cities, to gather themselves to us,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>3	And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we sought it not in the days of Saul.
<br>4	And all the multitude answered that it should be so: for the word pleased all the people. 5 So David assembled all Israel from Sihor of
<br>Egypt, even to the entering into Emath, to bring
<br>the ark of God from Cariathiarim.
<br>6	And David went up with all the men of Is- rael to the hill of Cariathiarim which is in Juda, to bring thence the ark of the Lord God sitting upon the cherubims, where his name is called upon.
<br>7	And they carried the ark of God upon a new cart out of the house of Abinadab. And Oza and his brother drove the cart.
<br>8	And David and all Israel played before God with all their might with hymns, and with harps, and with psalteries, and timbrels, and cymbals, and trumpets,
<br>9	And when they came to the floor of Chidon, Oza put forth his hand, to hold up the ark: for the ox being wanton had made it lean a little on one side.
<br>10	And the Lord was angry with Oza, and struck him, because he had touched the ark; and he died there before the Lord.
<br>11	And David was troubled because the Lord had divided Oza: and he called that place the Breach of Oza to this day.
<br>12	And he feared God at that time, saying: How can I bring in the ark of God to me?
<br>13	And therefore he brought it not home to himself, that is, into the city of David, but car- ried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gethite.
<br>14	And the ark of God remained in the house of Obededom three months: and the Lord blessed his house, and all that he had.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 14
<br>
<br>And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and masons, and car- penters, to build him a house.
<br>2	And David perceived that the Lord had con- firmed him king over Israel, and that his king- dom was exalted over his people Israel.
<br>3	And David took other wives in Jerusalem: and he begot sons, and daughters.
<br>4	Now these are the names of them that were born to him in Jerusalem: Samua, and Sobad, Nathan, and Solomon,
<br>5	Jebahar, and Elisua, and Eliphalet,
<br>6	And Noga, and Napheg, and Japhia,
<br>7	Elisama, and Baaliada, and Eliphalet.
<br>8	And the Philistines hearing that David was anointed king over all Israel, went all up to seek him: and David heard of it, and went out against them.
<br>9	And the Philistines came and spread them- selves in the vale of Raphaim.
<br>10	And David consulted the Lord, saying: Shall I go up against the Philistines, and wilt thou deliver them into my hand? And the Lord said to him: Go up, and I will deliver them into thy hand.
<br>11	And when they were come to Baalpha- rasim, David defeated them there, and he said: God hath divided my enemies by my hand, as waters are divided: and therefore the name of that place was called Baalpharasim.
<br>12	And they left there their gods, and David commanded that they should be burnt.
<br>13	Another time also the Philistines made an irruption, and spread themselves abroad in the valley.
<br>14	And David consulted God again, and God said to him: Go not up after them, turn away
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>from them, and come upon them over against the pear trees.
<br>15	And when thou shalt hear the sound of one going in the tops of the pear trees, then shalt thou go out to battle. For God is gone out before thee to strike the army of the Philistines.
<br>16	And David did as God had commanded him, and defeated the army of the Philistines, slaying them from Gabaon to Gazera.
<br>17	And the name of David became famous in all countries, and the Lord made all nations fear aim.
<br>
<br>Chapter 15
<br>
<br>He made also houses for himself in the city of David: and built a place for the ark of God, and pitched a tabernacle for it.
<br>2	Then David said: No one ought to carry the ark of God, but the Levites, whom the Lord hath chosen to carry it, and to minister unto himself for ever.
<br>3	And he gathered all Israel together into Jerusalem, that the ark of God might be brought into its place, which he had prepared for it.
<br>4	And the sons of Aaron also, and the Levites.
<br>5	Of the children of Caath, Uriel was the chief, and his brethren a hundred and twenty.
<br>6	Of the sons of Merari, Asaia the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty.
<br>7	Of the sons of Gersom, Joel the chief, and his brethren a hundred and thirty.
<br>8	Of the sons of Elisaphan, Semeias the chief: and his brethren two hundred.
<br>9	Of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief: and his brethren eighty.
<br>10	Of the sons of Oziel, Aminadab the chief: and his brethren a hundred and twelve.
<br> 
<br>11	And David called Sadoc, and Abiathar the priests, and the Levites, Uriel, Asaia, Joel, Se- meia, Eliel, and Aminadab:
<br>12	And he said to them: You that are the heads of the Levitical families, be sanctified with your brethren, and bring the ark of the Lord the God of Israel to the place, which is prepared for it:
<br>13	Lest as the Lord at first struck us, because you were not present, the same should now also come to pass, by our doing some thing against the law.
<br>14	So the priests and the Levites were sanc- tified, to carry the ark of the Lord the God of Israel.
<br>15	And the sons of Levi took the ark of God as Moses had commanded, according to the word of the Lord, upon their shoulders, with the staves.
<br>16	And David spoke to the chiefs of the Levites, to appoint some of their brethren to be singers with musical instruments, to wit, on psalteries, and harps, and cymbals, that the joy- ful noise might resound on high.
<br>17	And they appointed Levites, Hemam the son of Joel, and of his brethren Asaph the son of Barachias: and of the sons of Merari, their brethren: Ethan the son of Casaia.
<br>18	And with them their brethren: in the sec- ond rank, Zacharias, and Ben, and Jaziel, and Semiramoth, and Jahiel, and Ani, and Eliab, and Banaias, and Maasias, and Mathathias, and Eliphalu, and Macenias, and Obededom, and Je- hiel, the porters.
<br>19	Now the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, sounded with cymbals of brass.
<br>20	And Zacharias, and Oziel, and Semi- ramoth, and Jehiel, and Ani, and Eliab, and Maasias, and Banaias, sung mysteries upon psalteries.
<br>21	And Mathathias, and Eliphalu, and Mace-
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>nias and Obededom, and Jehiel and Ozaziu, sung a song of victory for the octave upon harps.
<br>22	And Chonenias chief of the Levites, presided over the prophecy, to give out the tunes: for he was very skilful.
<br>23	And Barachias, and Elcana, were door- keepers of the ark.
<br>24	And Sebenias, and Josaphat, and Nathanael, and Amasai, and Zacharias, and Ba- naias, and Eliezer the priests, sounded with trumpets, before the ark of God: and Obede- dom and Jehias were porters of the ark.
<br>25	So David and all the ancients of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the house of Obededom with joy.
<br>26	And when God had helped the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord, they offered in sacrifice seven oxen, and seven rams.
<br>27	And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that carried the ark, and the singing men, and Chonenias the ruler of the prophecy among the singers: and David also had on him an ephod of linen.
<br>28	And all Israel brought the ark of the covenant of the Lord with joyful shouting, and sounding with the sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and cymbals, and psalteries, and harps.
<br>29	And when the ark of the covenant of the Lord was come to the city of David, Michol the daughter of Saul looking out at a window, saw king David dancing and playing, and she de- spised him in her heart.
<br>
<br>Chapter 16
<br>So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent, which David had pitched for it:
<br> 
<br>and they offered holocausts, and peace offerings before God.
<br>2	And when David had made an end of offering holocausts, and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the Lord.
<br>3	And he divided to all and every one, both men and women, a loaf of bread, and a piece of roasted beef, and flour fried with oil.
<br>4	And he appointed Levites to minister before the ark of the Lord, and to remember his works, and to glorify, and praise the Lord God of Israel.
<br>5	Asaph the chief, and next after him Zacharias: moreover Jahiel, and Semiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mathathias, and Eliab, and Ba- naias, and Obededom: and Jehiel over the in- struments of psaltery, and harps: and Asaph sounded with cymbals:
