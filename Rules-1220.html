<br>§4864. Increased participation of United States contractors in local guard contracts abroad under diplomatic security program
<br>(a) Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>(1) State Department policy concerning the advertising of security contracts at Foreign Service buildings has been inconsistent over the years. In many cases, diplomatic and consular posts abroad have been given the responsibility to determine the manner in which the private sector was notified concerning an invitation for bids or a request for proposals with respect to a local guard contract. Some United States foreign missions have only chosen to advertise locally the availability of a local security guard contract abroad.
<br>
<br>(2) As a result, many United States security firms that provide local guard services abroad have been unaware that local guard contracts were available for bidding abroad and such firms have been disadvantaged as a result.
<br>
<br>(3) Undoubtedly, United States security firms would be interested in bidding on more local guard contracts abroad if such firms knew of the opportunity to bid on such contracts.
<br>(b) Objective
<br>
<br>It is the objective of this section to improve the efficiency of the local guard programs abroad administered by the Bureau of Diplomatic Security of the Department of State and to ensure maximum competition for local guard contracts abroad concerning Foreign Service buildings.
<br>(c) Participation of United States contractors in local guard contracts abroad
<br>
<br>With respect to local guard contracts for a Foreign Service building which exceed $250,000 and are entered into after February 16, 1990, the Secretary of State shall—
<br>
<br>(1) establish procedures to ensure that all solicitations for such contracts are adequately advertised in the Commerce and Business Daily;
<br>
<br>(2) absent compelling reasons, award such contracts through the competitive process;
<br>
<br>(3) in evaluating proposals for such contracts, award contracts to the technically acceptable firm offering the lowest evaluated price, except that proposals of United States persons and qualified United States joint venture persons (as defined in subsection (d)) shall be evaluated by reducing the bid price by 10 percent;
<br>
<br>(4) in countries where contract denomination and/or payment in local currencies constitutes a barrier to competition by United States firms—
<br>
<br>(A) allow solicitations to be bid in United States dollars; and
<br>
<br>(B) allow contracts awarded to United States firms to be paid in United States dollars;
<br>
<br>(5) ensure that United States diplomatic and consular posts assist United States firms in obtaining local licenses and permits; and
<br>
<br>(6) establish procedures to ensure that appropriate measures are taken by diplomatic and consular post management to assure that United States persons and qualified United States joint venture persons are not disadvantaged during the solicitation and bid evaluation process.
<br>(d) Definitions
<br>
<br>For the purposes of this section—
<br>
<br>(1) the term "United States person" means a person which—
<br>
<br>(A) is incorporated or legally organized under the laws of the United States, including the laws of any State, locality, or the District of Columbia;
<br>
<br>(B) has its principal place of business in the United States;
<br>
<br>(C) has been incorporated or legally organized in the United States for more than 2 years before the issuance date of the invitation for bids or request for proposals with respect to the contract under subsection (c);
<br>
<br>(D) has performed within the United States or overseas security services similar in complexity to the contract being bid;
<br>
<br>(E) with respect to the contract under subsection (c), has achieved a total business volume equal to or greater than the value of the project being bid in 3 years of the 5-year period before the date specified in subparagraph (C);
<br>
<br>(F)(i) employs United States citizens in at least 80 percent of its principal management positions in the United States; and
<br>
<br>(ii) employs United States citizens in more than half of its permanent, full-time positions in the United States; and
<br>
<br>(G) has the existing technical and financial resources in the United States to perform the contract;
<br>
<br>(2) the term "qualified United States joint venture person" means a joint venture in which a United States person or persons owns at least 51 percent of the assets of the joint venture;
<br>
<br>(3) the term "Foreign Service building" means any building or grounds of the United States which is in a foreign country and is under the jurisdiction and control of the Secretary of State, including residences of United States personnel assigned overseas under the authority of the Ambassador; and
<br>

<br>(A) conditions of extreme currency volatility;
<br>
<br>(B) restrictions on repatriation of profits;

<br>
<br>(D) government restrictions inhibiting the free convertibility of foreign exchange; or
<br>
<br>(E) conditions of extreme local political instability.
<br>(e) United States minority contractors
<br>
<br>Not less than 10 percent of the amount of funds obligated for local guard contracts for Foreign Service buildings subject to subsection (c) shall be allocated to the extent practicable for contracts with United States minority small business contractors.
<br>(f) United States small business contractors
<br>
<br>Not less than 10 percent of the amount of funds obligated for local guard contracts for Foreign Service buildings subject to subsection (c) shall be allocated to the extent practicable for contracts with United States small business contractors.
<br>(g) Limitation of subcontracting
<br>
<br>With respect to local guard contracts subject to subsection (c), a prime contractor may not subcontract more than 50 percent of the total value of its contract for that project.
<br>(h) Award of local guard and protective service contracts
<br>
<br>In evaluating proposals for local guard contracts under this section, the Secretary of State may award such contracts on the basis of best value as determined by a cost-technical tradeoff analysis (as described in Federal Acquisition Regulation part 15.101) and, with respect to such contracts for posts that are not high risk, high threat posts (as such term is defined in section 4803 of this title), subject to congressional notification 15-days prior to any such award.

<br>Findings
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 106–113, div. B, §1000(a)(7) [div. A, title VI, §602], Nov. 29, 1999, 113 Stat. 1536, 1501A–451, provided that: "Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>"(1) On August 7, 1998, the United States embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, were destroyed by simultaneously exploding bombs. The resulting explosions killed 220 persons and injured more than 4,000 others. Twelve Americans and 40 Kenyan and Tanzanian employees of the United States Foreign Service were killed in the attack.
<br>
<br>"(2) The United States personnel in both Dar es Salaam and Nairobi showed leadership and personal courage in their response to the attacks. Despite the havoc wreaked upon the embassies, staff in both embassies provided rapid response in locating and rescuing victims, providing emergency assistance, and quickly restoring embassy operations during a crisis.
<br>
<br>"(3) The bombs are believed to have been set by individuals associated with Osama bin Laden, leader of a known transnational terrorist organization. In February 1998, bin Laden issued a directive to his followers that called for attacks against United States interests anywhere in the world.
<br>
<br>"(4) Threats continue to be made against United States diplomatic facilities.
<br>
<br>"(5) Accountability Review Boards were convened following the bombings, as required by Public Law 99–399 [see Tables for classification], chaired by Admiral William J. Crowe, United States Navy (Ret.) (in this section referred to as the 'Crowe panels').
<br>
<br>"(6) The conclusions of the Crowe panels were strikingly similar to those stated by the Commission chaired by Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, which issued an extensive embassy security report in 1985.
<br>
<br>"(7) The Crowe panels issued a report setting out many problems with security at United States diplomatic facilities, in particular the following:
<br>
<br>"(A) The United States Government has devoted inadequate resources to security against terrorist attacks.
<br>
<br>"(B) The United States Government places too low a priority on security concerns.
<br>
<br>"(8) The result has been a failure to take adequate steps to prevent tragedies such as the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania.
<br>
<br>"(9) The Crowe panels found that there was an institutional failure on the part of the Department of State to recognize threats posed by transnational terrorism and vehicular bombs.
<br>
<br>"(10) Responsibility for ensuring adequate resources for security programs is widely shared throughout the United States Government, including Congress. Unless the vulnerabilities identified by the Crowe panels are addressed in a sustained and financially realistic manner, the lives and safety of United States employees in diplomatic facilities will continue to be at risk from further terrorist attacks.
<br>
<br>"(11) Although service in the Foreign Service or other United States Government positions abroad can never be completely without risk, the United States Government must take all reasonable steps to minimize security risks."

<br>
<br>"(1) for fiscal year 2000, $900,000,000;
<br>
<br>"(2) for fiscal year 2001, $900,000,000;

<br>
<br>"(1) the acquisition of United States diplomatic facilities and, if necessary, any residences or other structures located in close physical proximity to such facilities, or
<br>
<br>"(2) the provision of major security enhancements to United States diplomatic facilities,
<br>
<br>to the extent necessary to bring the United States Government into compliance with all requirements applicable to the security of United States diplomatic facilities, including the relevant requirements set forth in section 606 [22 U.S.C. 4865].
<br>
<br>"(c) Availability of Authorizations.—Authorizations of appropriations under subsection (a) shall remain available until the appropriations are made.
<br>
<br>"(d) Availability of Funds.—Amounts appropriated pursuant to subsection (a) are authorized to remain available until expended.
<br>
<br>"(e) Capital Security Cost Sharing.—
<br>
<br>"(1) Authority.—Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all agencies with personnel overseas subject to chief of mission authority pursuant to section 207 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 (22 U.S.C. 3927) shall participate and provide funding in advance for their share of costs of providing, maintaining, repairing, and renovating safe, secure United States diplomatic facilities, without offsets, on the basis of the total overseas presence of each agency as determined annually by the Secretary of State in consultation with such agency. Amounts advanced by such agencies to the Department of State shall be credited to the Embassy Security, Construction and Maintenance account, and remain available until expended.
<br>
<br>"(2) Implementation.—Implementation of this subsection shall be carried out in a manner that encourages right-sizing of each agency's overseas presence. A project to construct a diplomatic facility of the United States may not include office space or other accommodations for an employee of a Federal department or agency to the extent that the Secretary of State determines that such department or agency has not provided to the Department of State the full amount of funding required under paragraph (1), notwithstanding any authorization and appropriation of relevant funds by Congress.
<br>
<br>"(3) Exclusion.—For purposes of this subsection 'agency' does not include the Marine Security Guard."
