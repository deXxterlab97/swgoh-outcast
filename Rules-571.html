<br>§720l. Sense of Congress concerning natural gas demand
<br>
<br>It is the sense of Congress that—
<br>
<br>(1) North American demand for natural gas will increase dramatically over the course of the next several decades;
<br>
<br>(2) both the Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline and the Mackenzie Delta Natural Gas project in Canada will be necessary to help meet the increased demand for natural gas in North America;
<br>
<br>(3) Federal and State officials should work together with officials in Canada to ensure both projects can move forward in a mutually beneficial fashion;
<br>
<br>(4) Federal and State officials should acknowledge that the smaller scope, fewer permitting requirements, and lower cost of the Mackenzie Delta project means it will most likely be completed before the Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline;
<br>
<br>(5) natural gas production in the 48 contiguous States and Canada will not be able to meet all domestic demand in the coming decades; and
<br>
<br>(6) as a result, natural gas delivered from Alaskan North Slope will not displace or reduce the commercial viability of Canadian natural gas produced from the Mackenzie Delta or production from the 48 contiguous States.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 108–324, div. C, §114, Oct. 13, 2004, 118 Stat. 1264.)
<br>§720m. Sense of Congress concerning Alaskan ownership
<br>
<br>It is the sense of Congress that—
<br>
<br>(1) Alaska Native Regional Corporations, companies owned and operated by Alaskans, and individual Alaskans should have the opportunity to own shares of the Alaska natural gas pipeline in a way that promotes economic development for the State; and
<br>
<br>(2) to facilitate economic development in the State, all project sponsors should negotiate in good faith with any willing Alaskan person that desires to be involved in the project.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 108–324, div. C, §115, Oct. 13, 2004, 118 Stat. 1265.)

<br>
<br>(1) The amount of loans and other debt obligations guaranteed under this section for a qualified infrastructure project shall not exceed 80 percent of the total capital costs of the project, including interest during construction.
<br>
<br>(2) The principal amount of loans and other debt obligations guaranteed under this section shall not exceed, in the aggregate, $18,000,000,000, which amount shall be indexed for United States dollar inflation from October 13, 2004, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, except that the total amount of principal that may be guaranteed for a qualified liquefied natural gas project may not exceed a principal amount in which the cost of loan guarantees, as defined by section 661a(5) of title 2, exceeds $2,000,000,000.
<br>(d) Loan terms and fees
<br>

<br>§761. Congressional declaration of purpose
<br>(a) Objectives
<br>
<br>The Congress hereby declares that the general welfare and the common defense and security require positive and effective action to conserve scarce energy supplies, to insure fair and efficient distribution of, and the maintenance of fair and reasonable consumer prices for, such supplies, to promote the expansion of readily usable energy sources, and to assist in developing policies and plans to meet the energy needs of the Nation.
<br>(b) Necessity for reorganization
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that to help achieve these objectives, and to assure a coordinated and effective approach to overcoming energy shortages, it is necessary to reorganize certain agencies and functions of the executive branch and to establish a Federal Energy Administration.
<br>(c) Creation of Federal Energy Administration
<br>
