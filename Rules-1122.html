<br>
<br>(2) The Director shall provide, by July 1 of each year, budget recommendations to the heads of departments and agencies with responsibilities under the National Drug Control Program.

<br>(b) Measurement of National Drug Control Strategy Outcomes. (1) The National Drug Control Strategy shall include long-range goals for reducing drug use and the consequences of drug use in the United States, including burdens on hospital emergency rooms, drug use among arrestees, the extent of drug-related crime, high school dropout rates, the number of infants exposed annually to illicit drugs in utero, national drug abuse treatment capacity, and the annual national health care costs of drug use.
<br>
<br>(2) The National Drug Control Strategy shall also include an assessment of the quality of techniques and instruments to measure current drug use and supply and demand reduction activities, and the adequacy of the coverage of existing national drug use instruments and techniques to measure the total illicit drug user population and groups at-risk for drug use.
<br>
<br>(3) The Director shall coordinate an effort among the relevant drug control program agencies to assess the quality, access, management, effectiveness, and standards of accountability of drug abuse treatment, prevention, education, and other demand reduction activities.
<br>
<br>(c) Provision of Reports. To the extent permitted by law, heads of departments and agencies with responsibilities under the National Drug Control Program shall make available to the Office of National Drug Control Policy, appropriate statistics, studies, and reports, pertaining to Federal drug abuse control.

<br>§1706. High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas Program
<br>(a) Establishment
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>There is established in the Office a program to be known as the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas Program (in this section referred to as the "Program").
<br>(2) Purpose
<br>
<br>The purpose of the Program is to reduce drug trafficking and drug production in the United States by—
<br>
<br>(A) facilitating cooperation among Federal, State, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies to share information and implement coordinated enforcement activities;
<br>
<br>(B) enhancing law enforcement intelligence sharing among Federal, State, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies;
<br>
<br>(C) providing reliable law enforcement intelligence to law enforcement agencies needed to design effective enforcement strategies and operations; and
<br>
<br>(D) supporting coordinated law enforcement strategies which maximize use of available resources to reduce the supply of illegal drugs in designated areas and in the United States as a whole.
<br>(b) Designation
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Director, in consultation with the Attorney General, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Homeland Security, heads of the National Drug Control Program agencies, and the Governor of each applicable State, may designate any specified area of the United States as a high intensity drug trafficking area.
<br>(2) Activities
<br>
<br>After making a designation under paragraph (1) and in order to provide Federal assistance to the area so designated, the Director may—
<br>
<br>(A) obligate such sums as are appropriated for the Program;
<br>
<br>(B) direct the temporary reassignment of Federal personnel to such area, subject to the approval of the head of the department or agency that employs such personnel;
<br>
<br>(C) take any other action authorized under section 1703 of this title to provide increased Federal assistance to those areas; and
<br>
<br>(D) coordinate activities under this section (specifically administrative, recordkeeping, and funds management activities) with State, local, and tribal officials.
<br>(c) Petitions for designation
<br>
<br>The Director shall establish regulations under which a coalition of interested law enforcement agencies from an area may petition for designation as a high intensity drug trafficking area. Such regulations shall provide for a regular review by the Director of the petition, including a recommendation regarding the merit of the petition to the Director by a panel of qualified, independent experts.
<br>(d) Factors for consideration
<br>
<br>In considering whether to designate an area under this section as a high intensity drug trafficking area, the Director shall consider, in addition to such other criteria as the Director considers to be appropriate, the extent to which—
<br>
<br>(1) the area is a significant center of illegal drug production, manufacturing, importation, or distribution;
<br>
<br>(2) State, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies have committed resources to respond to the drug trafficking problem in the area, thereby indicating a determination to respond aggressively to the problem;
<br>
<br>(3) drug-related activities in the area are having a significant harmful impact in the area, and in other areas of the country; and
<br>
<br>(4) a significant increase in allocation of Federal resources is necessary to respond adequately to drug-related activities in the area.
<br>(e) Organization of high intensity drug trafficking areas
<br>(1) Executive Board and officers
<br>
<br>To be eligible for funds appropriated under this section, each high intensity drug trafficking area shall be governed by an Executive Board. The Executive Board shall designate a chairman, vice chairman, and any other officers to the Executive Board that it determines are necessary.
<br>(2) Responsibilities
<br>
<br>The Executive Board of a high intensity drug trafficking area shall be responsible for—
<br>
<br>(A) providing direction and oversight in establishing and achieving the goals of the high intensity drug trafficking area;
<br>
<br>(B) managing the funds of the high intensity drug trafficking area;
<br>
<br>(C) reviewing and approving all funding proposals consistent with the overall objective of the high intensity drug trafficking area; and
<br>
<br>(D) reviewing and approving all reports to the Director on the activities of the high intensity drug trafficking area.
<br>(3) Board representation
<br>
<br>None of the funds appropriated under this section may be expended for any high intensity drug trafficking area, or for a partnership or region of a high intensity drug trafficking area, if the Executive Board for such area, region, or partnership, does not apportion an equal number of votes between representatives of participating Federal agencies and representatives of participating State, local, and tribal agencies. Where it is impractical for an equal number of representatives of Federal agencies and State, local, and tribal agencies to attend a meeting of an Executive Board in person, the Executive Board may use a system of proxy votes or weighted votes to achieve the voting balance required by this paragraph.
<br>(4) No agency relationship
<br>
<br>The eligibility requirements of this section are intended to ensure the responsible use of Federal funds. Nothing in this section is intended to create an agency relationship between individual high intensity drug trafficking areas and the Federal Government.
<br>(f) Use of funds
<br>
<br>The Director shall ensure that not more than a total of 5 percent of Federal funds appropriated for the Program are expended for substance use disorder treatment programs and drug prevention programs.
<br>(g) Counterterrorism activities
<br>(1) Assistance authorized
<br>
<br>The Director may authorize use of resources available for the Program to assist Federal, State, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies in investigations and activities related to terrorism and prevention of terrorism, especially but not exclusively with respect to such investigations and activities that are also related to drug trafficking.
<br>(2) Limitation
<br>
<br>The Director shall ensure—
<br>
<br>(A) that assistance provided under paragraph (1) remains incidental to the purpose of the Program to reduce drug availability and carry out drug-related law enforcement activities; and
<br>
<br>(B) that significant resources of the Program are not redirected to activities exclusively related to terrorism, except on a temporary basis under extraordinary circumstances, as determined by the Director.
<br>(h) Role of Drug Enforcement Administration
<br>
<br>The Director, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall ensure that a representative of the Drug Enforcement Administration is included in the Intelligence Support Center for each high intensity drug trafficking area.
<br>(i) Annual HIDTA Program budget submissions
<br>
<br>As part of the documentation that supports the President's annual budget request for the Office, the Director shall submit to Congress a budget justification that includes—
<br>
<br>(1) the amount proposed for each high intensity drug trafficking area, conditional upon a review by the Office of the request submitted by the HIDTA and the performance of the HIDTA, with supporting narrative descriptions and rationale for each request;
<br>
<br>(2) a detailed justification that explains—
<br>
<br>(A) the reasons for the proposed funding level; how such funding level was determined based on a current assessment of the drug trafficking threat in each high intensity drug trafficking area;
<br>
<br>(B) how such funding will ensure that the goals and objectives of each such area will be achieved; and
<br>
<br>(C) how such funding supports the National Drug Control Strategy; and
<br>
<br>(3) the amount of HIDTA funds used to investigate and prosecute organizations and individuals trafficking in methamphetamine in the prior calendar year, and a description of how those funds were used.
<br>(j) Emerging threat response fund
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Subject to the availability of appropriations, the Director may expend up to 10 percent of the amounts appropriated under this section on a discretionary basis, to respond to any emerging drug trafficking threat in an existing high intensity drug trafficking area, or to establish a new high intensity drug trafficking area or expand an existing high intensity drug trafficking area, in accordance with the criteria established under paragraph (2).
<br>(2) Consideration of impact
<br>
<br>In allocating funds under this subsection, the Director shall consider—
<br>
<br>(A) the impact of activities funded on reducing overall drug traffic in the United States, or minimizing the probability that an emerging drug trafficking threat will spread to other areas of the United States; and
<br>
<br>(B) such other criteria as the Director considers appropriate.
