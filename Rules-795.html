<br>
<br>(3) The demographic, geographic, economic, and other characteristics of an area and affected communities when determining whether consolidated operations at a single airport effectively serve the needs of the point.
<br>
<br>(4) Maintaining a robust air transportation system, including maintaining air service to airports throughout the United States, plays an important role in the effective distribution of a coronavirus vaccine.
<br>
