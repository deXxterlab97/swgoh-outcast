<br>(b) Recipients, duration, and size

<br>(2) Duration
<br>
<br>Grants or contracts made under this division shall be awarded for a period of 5 years, except that—

<br>(c) Procedures for awarding grants and contracts
<br>(1) Application requirements
<br>
<br>An eligible entity that desires to receive a grant or contract under this division shall submit an application to the Secretary in such manner and form, and containing such information and assurances, as the Secretary may reasonably require.
<br>(2) Considerations
<br>(A) Prior experience
<br>
<br>In making grants under this division, the Secretary shall consider each applicant's prior experience of high quality service delivery, as determined under subsection (f), under the particular program for which funds are sought. The level of consideration given the factor of prior experience shall not vary from the level of consideration given such factor during fiscal years 1994 through 1997, except that grants made under section 1070a–18 of this title shall not be given prior experience consideration.
<br>(B) Participant need
<br>
<br>In making grants under this division, the Secretary shall consider the number, percentages, and needs of eligible participants in the area, institution of higher education, or secondary school to be served to aid such participants in preparing for, enrolling in, or succeeding in postsecondary education, as appropriate to the particular program for which the eligible entity is applying.
<br>(3) Order of awards; program fraud
<br>
<br>(A) Except with respect to grants made under sections 1070a–17 and 1070a–18 of this title and as provided in subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall award grants and contracts under this division in the order of the scores received by the application for such grant or contract in the peer review process required under paragraph (4) and adjusted for prior experience in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subsection.
<br>
<br>(B) The Secretary shall not provide assistance to a program otherwise eligible for assistance under this division, if the Secretary has determined that such program has involved the fraudulent use of funds under this division.
<br>(4) Peer review process
<br>
<br>(A) The Secretary shall ensure that, to the extent practicable, members of groups underrepresented in higher education, including African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, Alaska Natives, Asian Americans, and Native American Pacific Islanders (including Native Hawaiians), are represented as readers of applications submitted under this division. The Secretary shall also ensure that persons from urban and rural backgrounds are represented as readers.
<br>
<br>(B) The Secretary shall ensure that each application submitted under this division is read by at least three readers who are not employees of the Federal Government (other than as readers of applications).
<br>(5) Number of applications for grants and contracts
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall not limit the number of applications submitted by an entity under any program authorized under this division if the additional applications describe programs serving different populations or different campuses.
<br>(6) Coordination with other programs for disadvantaged students
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall encourage coordination of programs assisted under this division with other programs for disadvantaged students operated by the sponsoring institution or agency, regardless of the funding source of such programs. The Secretary shall not limit an entity's eligibility to receive funds under this division because such entity sponsors a program similar to the program to be assisted under this division, regardless of the funding source of such program. The Secretary shall permit the Director of a program receiving funds under this division to administer one or more additional programs for disadvantaged students operated by the sponsoring institution or agency, regardless of the funding sources of such programs.

<br>(7) Application status
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall inform each entity operating programs under this division regarding the status of their application for continued funding at least 8 months prior to the expiration of the grant or contract. The Secretary, in the case of an entity that is continuing to operate a successful program under this division, shall ensure that the start-up date for a new grant or contract for such program immediately follows the termination of the preceding grant or contract so that no interruption of funding occurs for such successful reapplicants. The Secretary shall inform each entity requesting assistance under this division for a new program regarding the status of their application at least 8 months prior to the proposed startup date of such program.
<br>(8) Review and notification by the Secretary
<br>(A) Guidance
<br>
<br>Not later than 180 days after August 14, 2008, the Secretary shall issue nonregulatory guidance regarding the rights and responsibilities of applicants with respect to the application and evaluation process for programs and projects assisted under this division, including applicant access to peer review comments.

<br>Not later than 45 days before the date of the commencement of each competition for a grant under this division that is held after the expiration of the 180-day period described in subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall update and publish the guidance described in such subparagraph.
<br>(C) Review
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>With respect to any competition for a grant under this division, an applicant may request a review by the Secretary if the applicant—
<br>
<br>(I) has evidence of a specific technical, administrative, or scoring error made by the Department, an agent of the Department, or a peer reviewer, with respect to the scoring or processing of a submitted application; and
<br>
<br>(II) has otherwise met all of the requirements for submission of the application.
<br>(ii) Technical or administrative error
<br>
<br>In the case of evidence of a technical or administrative error listed in clause (i)(I), the Secretary shall review such evidence and provide a timely response to the applicant. If the Secretary determines that a technical or administrative error was made by the Department or an agent of the Department, the application of the applicant shall be reconsidered in the peer review process for the applicable grant competition.
<br>(iii) Scoring error
<br>
<br>In the case of evidence of a scoring error listed in clause (i)(I), when the error relates to either prior experience points for high quality service delivery or to the final score of an application, the Secretary shall—
<br>
<br>(I) review such evidence and provide a timely response to the applicant; and
<br>
<br>(II) if the Secretary determines that a scoring error was made by the Department or a peer reviewer, adjust the prior experience points or final score of the application appropriately and quickly, so as not to interfere with the timely awarding of grants for the applicable grant competition.
<br>(iv) Error in peer review process
<br>(I) Referral to secondary review
<br>
<br>In the case of a peer review process error listed in clause (i)(I), if the Secretary determines that points were withheld for criteria not required in Federal statute, regulation, or guidance governing a program assisted under this division or the application for a grant for such program, or determines that information pertaining to selection criteria was wrongly determined to be missing from an application by a peer reviewer, then the Secretary shall refer the application to a secondary review panel.
<br>(II) Timely review; replacement score
<br>
<br>The secondary review panel described in subclause (I) shall conduct a secondary review in a timely fashion, and the score resulting from the secondary review shall replace the score from the initial peer review.
<br>(III) Composition of secondary review panel
<br>
<br>The secondary review panel shall be composed of reviewers each of whom—
<br>
<br>(aa) did not review the application in the original peer review;
<br>
<br>(bb) is a member of the cohort of peer reviewers for the grant program that is the subject of such secondary review; and
<br>
<br>(cc) to extent practicable, has conducted peer reviews in not less than two previous competitions for the grant program that is the subject of such secondary review.
<br>(IV) Final score
<br>
<br>The final peer review score of an application subject to a secondary review under this clause shall be adjusted appropriately and quickly using the score awarded by the secondary review panel, so as not to interfere with the timely awarding of grants for the applicable grant competition.
<br>(V) Qualification for secondary review
<br>
<br>To qualify for a secondary review under this clause, an applicant shall have evidence of a scoring error and demonstrate that—
<br>
<br>(aa) points were withheld for criteria not required in statute, regulation, or guidance governing the Federal TRIO programs or the application for a grant for such programs; or
<br>
<br>(bb) information pertaining to selection criteria was wrongly determined to be missing from the application.
<br>(v) Finality
<br>(I) In general
<br>
<br>A determination by the Secretary under clause (i), (ii), or (iii) shall not be reviewable by any officer or employee of the Department.
<br>(II) Scoring
<br>
<br>The score awarded by a secondary review panel under clause (iv) shall not be reviewable by any officer or employee of the Department other than the Secretary.
<br>(vi) Funding of applications with certain adjusted scores
<br>
<br>To the extent feasible based on the availability of appropriations, the Secretary shall fund applications with scores that are adjusted upward under clauses (ii), (iii), and (iv) to equal or exceed the minimum cut off score for the applicable grant competition.
<br>(d) Outreach
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall conduct outreach activities to ensure that entities eligible for assistance under this division submit applications proposing programs that serve geographic areas and eligible populations which have been underserved by the programs assisted under this division.

<br>
<br>In carrying out the provisions of paragraph (1), the Secretary shall notify the entities described in subsection (b) of the availability of assistance under this subsection not less than 120 days prior to the deadline for submission of applications under this division and shall consult national, State, and regional organizations about candidates for notification.
<br>(3) Technical assistance
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall provide technical training to applicants for projects and programs authorized under this division. The Secretary shall give priority to serving programs and projects that serve geographic areas and eligible populations which have been underserved by the programs assisted under this division. Technical training activities shall include the provision of information on authorizing legislation, goals and objectives of the program, required activities, eligibility requirements, the application process and application deadlines, and assistance in the development of program proposals and the completion of program applications. Such training shall be furnished at conferences, seminars, and workshops to be conducted at not less than 10 sites throughout the United States to ensure that all areas of the United States with large concentrations of eligible participants are served.
