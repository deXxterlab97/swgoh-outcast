<br>An insured credit union that is not well capitalized shall annually set aside as net worth an amount equal to not less than 0.4 percent of its total assets.
<br>(2) Board's authority to decrease earnings-retention requirement
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The Board may, by order, decrease the 0.4 percent requirement in paragraph (1) with respect to a credit union to the extent that the Board determines that the decrease—
<br>
<br>(i) is necessary to avoid a significant redemption of shares; and
<br>
<br>(ii) would further the purpose of this section.
<br>(B) Periodic review required
<br>
<br>The Board shall periodically review any order issued under subparagraph (A).
<br>(f) Net worth restoration plan required
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Each insured credit union that is undercapitalized shall submit an acceptable net worth restoration plan to the Board within the time allowed under this subsection.
<br>(2) Assistance to small credit unions
<br>
<br>The Board (or the staff of the Board) shall, upon timely request by an insured credit union with total assets of less than $10,000,000, and subject to such regulations or guidelines as the Board may prescribe, assist that credit union in preparing a net worth restoration plan.
<br>(3) Deadlines for submission and review of plans
<br>
<br>The Board shall, by regulation, establish deadlines for submission of net worth restoration plans under this subsection that—
<br>
<br>(A) provide insured credit unions with reasonable time to submit net worth restoration plans; and
<br>
<br>(B) require the Board to act on net worth restoration plans expeditiously.
<br>(4) Failure to submit acceptable plan within time allowed
<br>(A) Failure to submit any plan
<br>
<br>If an insured credit union fails to submit a net worth restoration plan within the time allowed under paragraph (3), the Board shall—
<br>
<br>(i) promptly notify the credit union of that failure; and
<br>
<br>(ii) give the credit union a reasonable opportunity to submit a net worth restoration plan.
<br>(B) Submission of unacceptable plan
<br>
<br>If an insured credit union submits a net worth restoration plan within the time allowed under paragraph (3), and the Board determines that the plan is not acceptable, the Board shall—
<br>
<br>(i) promptly notify the credit union of why the plan is not acceptable; and
<br>
<br>(ii) give the credit union a reasonable opportunity to submit a revised plan.
<br>(5) Accepting plan
<br>
<br>The Board may accept a net worth restoration plan only if the Board determines that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the net worth of the credit union.
<br>(g) Restrictions on undercapitalized credit unions
<br>(1) Restriction on asset growth
<br>
<br>An insured credit union that is undercapitalized shall not generally permit its average total assets to increase, unless—
<br>
<br>(A) the Board has accepted the net worth restoration plan of the credit union for that action;
<br>
<br>(B) any increase in total assets is consistent with the net worth restoration plan; and
<br>
<br>(C) the net worth ratio of the credit union increases at a rate that is consistent with the net worth restoration plan.
<br>(2) Restriction on member business loans
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding section 1757a(a) of this title, an insured credit union that is undercapitalized may not make any increase in the total amount of member business loans (as defined in section 1757a(c) of this title) outstanding at that credit union at any one time, until such time as the credit union becomes adequately capitalized.
<br>(h) More stringent treatment based on other supervisory criteria
<br>
<br>With respect to the exercise of authority by the Board under regulations comparable to section 1831o(g) of this title—
<br>
<br>(1) the Board may not reclassify an insured credit union into a lower net worth category, or treat an insured credit union as if it were in a lower net worth category, for reasons not pertaining to the safety and soundness of that credit union; and
<br>
<br>(2) the Board may not delegate its authority to reclassify an insured credit union into a lower net worth category or to treat an insured credit union as if it were in a lower net worth category.
<br>(i) Action required regarding critically undercapitalized credit unions
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Board shall, not later than 90 days after the date on which an insured credit union becomes critically undercapitalized—
<br>
<br>(A) appoint a conservator or liquidating agent for the credit union; or
<br>
<br>(B) take such other action as the Board determines would better achieve the purpose of this section, after documenting why the action would better achieve that purpose.
<br>(2) Periodic redeterminations required
<br>
<br>Any determination by the Board under paragraph (1)(B) to take any action with respect to an insured credit union in lieu of appointing a conservator or liquidating agent shall cease to be effective not later than the end of the 180-day period beginning on the date on which the determination is made, and a conservator or liquidating agent shall be appointed for that credit union under paragraph (1)(A), unless the Board makes a new determination under paragraph (1)(B) before the end of the effective period of the prior determination.
<br>(3) Appointment of liquidating agent required if other action fails to restore net worth
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2), the Board shall appoint a liquidating agent for an insured credit union if the credit union is critically undercapitalized on average during the calendar quarter beginning 18 months after the date on which the credit union became critically undercapitalized.
<br>(B) Exception
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the Board may continue to take such other action as the Board determines to be appropriate in lieu of appointment of a liquidating agent if—
<br>
<br>(i) the Board determines that—
<br>
<br>(I) the insured credit union has been in substantial compliance with an approved net worth restoration plan that requires consistent improvement in the net worth of the credit union since the date of the approval of the plan; and
<br>
<br>(II) the insured credit union has positive net income or has an upward trend in earnings that the Board projects as sustainable; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the Board certifies that the credit union is viable and not expected to fail.
<br>(4) Nondelegation
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the Board may not delegate the authority of the Board under this subsection.
<br>(B) Exception
<br>
<br>The Board may delegate the authority of the Board under this subsection with respect to an insured credit union that has less than $5,000,000 in total assets, if the Board permits the credit union to appeal any adverse action to the Board.
<br>(j) Reviews required when share insurance fund experiences losses
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>If the Fund incurs a material loss with respect to an insured credit union, the Inspector General of the Board shall—
<br>
<br>(A) submit to the Board a written report reviewing the supervision of the credit union by the Administration (including the implementation of this section by the Administration), which shall include—
<br>
<br>(i) a description of the reasons why the problems of the credit union resulted in a material loss to the Fund; and
<br>
<br>(ii) recommendations for preventing any such loss in the future; and

<br>
<br>(iv) to any Member of Congress, upon request.
<br>(2) Material loss defined
<br>
<br>For purposes of determining whether the Fund has incurred a material loss with respect to an insured credit union, a loss is material if it exceeds the sum of—
<br>
<br>(A) $25,000,000; and
<br>
<br>(B) an amount equal to 10 percent of the total assets of the credit union on the date on which the Board initiated assistance under section 1788 of this title or was appointed liquidating agent.
<br>(3) Public disclosure required
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The Board shall disclose a report under this subsection, upon request under section 552 of title 5, without excising—
<br>
<br>(i) any portion under section 552(b)(5) of title 5; or

<br>(ii) any information about the insured credit union (other than trade secrets) under section 552(b)(8) of title 5.

<br>(4) Losses that are not material
<br>(A) Semiannual report
<br>

<br>
<br>(i) identify any losses that the Inspector General estimates were incurred by the Fund during such 6-month period, with respect to insured credit unions;
<br>
<br>(ii) for each loss to the Fund that is not a material loss, determine—
<br>
<br>(I) the grounds identified by the Board or the State official having jurisdiction over a State credit union for appointing the Board as the liquidating agent for any Federal or State credit union; and
<br>
<br>(II) whether any unusual circumstances exist that might warrant an in-depth review of the loss; and
<br>
<br>(iii) prepare and submit a written report to the Board and to Congress on the results of the determinations of the Inspector General that includes—
<br>
<br>(I) an identification of any loss that warrants an in-depth review, and the reasons such review is warranted, or if the Inspector General determines that no review is warranted, an explanation of such determination; and
<br>
<br>(II) for each loss identified in subclause (I) that warrants an in-depth review, the date by which such review, and a report on the review prepared in a manner consistent with reports under paragraph (1)(A), will be completed.
<br>(B) Deadline for semiannual report
<br>

<br>
<br>(B) recommend improvements to the supervision of insured credit unions (including improvements relating to the implementation of this section).
<br>(k) Appeals process
<br>
<br>Material supervisory determinations, including decisions to require prompt corrective action, made pursuant to this section by Administration officials other than the Board may be appealed to the Board pursuant to the independent appellate process required by section 4806 of this title (or, if the Board so specifies, pursuant to separate procedures prescribed by regulation).
<br>(l) Consultation and cooperation with State credit union supervisors

<br>With respect to any decision by the Board on whether to appoint a conservator or liquidating agent for a State-chartered insured credit union—
<br>
<br>(A) the Board shall—
<br>
<br>(i) seek the views of the State official having jurisdiction over the credit union; and
<br>
<br>(ii) give that official an opportunity to take the proposed action;
<br>
<br>(B) the Board shall, upon timely request of an official referred to in subparagraph (A), promptly provide the official with—
<br>
<br>(i) a written statement of the reasons for the proposed action; and
<br>
<br>(ii) reasonable time to respond to that statement;
<br>
<br>(C) if the official referred to in subparagraph (A) makes a timely written response that disagrees with the proposed action and gives reasons for that disagreement, the Board shall not appoint a conservator or liquidating agent for the credit union, unless the Board, after considering the views of the official, has determined that—
<br>
<br>(i) the Fund faces a significant risk of loss with respect to the credit union if a conservator or liquidating agent is not appointed; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the appointment is necessary to reduce—
<br>
<br>(I) the risk that the Fund would incur a loss with respect to the credit union; or
<br>
<br>(II) any loss that the Fund is expected to incur with respect to the credit union; and
<br>
<br>(D) the Board may not delegate any determination under subparagraph (C).
<br>(m) Corporate credit unions exempted
<br>
<br>This section does not apply to any insured credit union that—
<br>
<br>(1) operates primarily for the purpose of serving credit unions; and
<br>
<br>(2) permits individuals to be members of the credit union only to the extent that applicable law requires that such persons own shares.

<br>§1790e. Temporary Corporate Credit Union Stabilization Fund
<br>(a) Establishment of Stabilization Fund
<br>
<br>There is hereby created in the Treasury of the United States a fund to be known as the "Temporary Corporate Credit Union Stabilization Fund." The Board will administer the Stabilization Fund as prescribed by section 1789 of this title.
<br>(b) Expenditures from Stabilization Fund
<br>
<br>Money in the Stabilization Fund shall be available upon requisition by the Board, without fiscal year limitation, for making payments for the purposes described in section 1783(a) of this title, subject to the following additional limitations:
<br>
<br>(1) All payments other than administrative payments shall be connected to the conservatorship, liquidation, or threatened conservatorship or liquidation, of a corporate credit union.
<br>
<br>(2) Prior to authorizing each payment the Board shall—
<br>
<br>(A) certify that, absent the existence of the Stabilization Fund, the Board would have made the identical payment out of the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (Insurance Fund); and
<br>
<br>(B) report each such certification to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives.
<br>(c) Authority to borrow
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Stabilization Fund is authorized to borrow from the Secretary of the Treasury from time-to-time as deemed necessary by the Board. The maximum outstanding amount of all borrowings from the Treasury by the Stabilization Fund and the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund, combined, is limited to the amount provided for in section 1783(d)(1) of this title, including any authorized increases in that amount.
<br>(2) Repayment of advances
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The advances made under this section shall be repaid by the Stabilization Fund, and interest on such advance shall be paid, to the General fund of the Treasury.
<br>(B) Variable rate of interest
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Treasury shall make the first rate determination at the time of the first advance under this section and shall reset the rate again for all advances on each anniversary of the first advance. The interest rate shall be equal to the average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity equal to 12 months.
<br>(3) Repayment schedule
<br>
<br>The Stabilization Fund shall repay the advances on a first-in, first-out basis, with interest on the amount repaid, at times and dates determined by the Board at its discretion. All advances shall be repaid not later than the date of the seventh anniversary of the first advance to the Stabilization Fund, unless the Board extends this final repayment date. The Board shall obtain the concurrence of the Secretary of the Treasury on any proposed extension, including the terms and conditions of the extended repayment and any additional advances.
<br>(d) Assessment authority
<br>(1) Assessments relating to expenditures under subsection (b)
<br>
<br>In order to make expenditures, as described in subsection (b), the Board may assess a special premium with respect to each insured credit union in an aggregate amount that is reasonably calculated to make any pending or future expenditure described in subsection (b), which premium shall be due and payable not later than 60 days after the date of the assessment. In setting the amount of any assessment under this subsection, the Board shall take into consideration any potential impact on credit union earnings that such an assessment may have.
<br>(2) Special premiums relating to repayments under subsection (c)(3)
<br>
<br>Not later than 90 days before the scheduled date of each repayment described in subsection (c)(3), the Board shall set the amount of the upcoming repayment and shall determine whether the Stabilization Fund will have sufficient funds to make the repayment. If the Stabilization Fund is not likely to have sufficient funds to make the repayment, the Board shall assess with respect to each insured credit union a special premium, which shall be due and payable not later than 60 days after the date of the assessment, in an aggregate amount calculated to ensure that the Stabilization Fund is able to make the required repayment.
<br>(3) Computation
<br>
<br>Any assessment or premium charge for an insured credit union under this subsection shall be stated as a percentage of its insured shares, as represented on the previous call report of that insured credit union. The percentage shall be identical for each insured credit union. Any insured credit union that fails to make timely payment of the assessment or special premium is subject to the procedures and penalties described under subsections (d), (e), and (f) of section 1782 of this title.
<br>(e) Distributions from Insurance Fund
<br>
<br>At the end of any calendar year in which the Stabilization Fund has an outstanding advance from the Treasury, the Insurance Fund is prohibited from making the distribution to insured credit unions described in section 1782(c)(3) of this title. In lieu of the distribution described in that section, the Insurance Fund shall make a distribution to the Stabilization Fund of the maximum amount possible that does not reduce the Insurance Fund's equity ratio below the normal operating level and does not reduce the Insurance Fund's available assets ratio below 1.0 percent.
<br>(f) Investment of Stabilization Fund assets
<br>
<br>The Board may request the Secretary of the Treasury to invest such portion of the Stabilization Fund as is not, in the Board's judgment, required to meet the current needs of the Stabilization Fund. Such investments shall be made by the Secretary of the Treasury in public debt securities, with maturities suitable to the needs of the Stabilization Fund, as determined by the Board, and bearing interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration current market yields on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturity.
<br>(g) Reports
<br>
<br>The Board shall submit an annual report to Congress on the financial condition and the results of the operation of the Stabilization Fund. The report is due to Congress within 30 days after each anniversary of the first advance made under subsection (c)(1). Because the Fund will use advances from the Treasury to meet corporate stabilization costs with full repayment of borrowings to Treasury at the Board's discretion not due until 7 years from the initial advance, to the extent operating expenses of the Fund exceed income, the financial condition of the Fund may reflect a deficit. With planned and required future repayments, the Board shall resolve all deficits prior to termination of the Fund.
<br>(h) Closing of Stabilization Fund
<br>
<br>Within 90 days following the seventh anniversary of the initial Stabilization Fund advance, or earlier at the Board's discretion, the Board shall distribute any funds, property, or other assets remaining in the Stabilization Fund to the Insurance Fund and shall close the Stabilization Fund. If the Board extends the final repayment date as permitted under subsection (c)(3), the mandatory date for closing the Stabilization Fund shall be extended by the same number of days.
