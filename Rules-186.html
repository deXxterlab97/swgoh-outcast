<br>
<br>(i) subtracting 65 percent of the applicable locality-based comparability pay percentage from the cost-of-living allowance percentage rate in effect on December 31, 2009; and
<br>
<br>(ii) dividing the resulting percentage determined under clause (i) by the sum of—
<br>
<br>(I) one; and

<br>
<br>(3) No allowance rate computed under paragraph (2) may be less than zero.

<br>
<br>1982—Pub. L. 97–221, §2(a)(1), July 23, 1982, 96 Stat. 227, added subchapter I heading so as to designate existing provisions as "SUBCHAPTER I—GENERAL PROVISIONS".
<br>§6101. Basic 40-hour workweek; work schedules; regulations
<br>
<br>(a)(1) For the purpose of this subsection, "employee" includes an employee of the government of the District of Columbia and an employee whose pay is fixed and adjusted from time to time under section 5343 or 5349 of this title, or by a wage board or similar administrative authority serving the same purpose, but does not include an employee or individual excluded from the definition of employee in section 5541(2) of this title, except as specifically provided under this paragraph.
<br>
<br>(2) The head of each Executive agency, military department, and of the government of the District of Columbia shall—
<br>
<br>(A) establish a basic administrative workweek of 40 hours for each full-time employee in his organization; and
<br>
<br>(B) require that the hours of work within that workweek be performed within a period of not more than 6 of any 7 consecutive days.
<br>
<br>(3) Except when the head of an Executive agency, a military department, or of the government of the District of Columbia determines that his organization would be seriously handicapped in carrying out its functions or that costs would be substantially increased, he shall provide, with respect to each employee in his organization, that—
<br>
<br>(A) assignments to tours of duty are scheduled in advance over periods of not less than 1 week;
<br>
<br>(B) the basic 40-hour workweek is scheduled on 5 days, Monday through Friday when possible, and the 2 days outside the basic workweek are consecutive;
<br>
<br>(C) the working hours in each day in the basic workweek are the same;
<br>
<br>(D) the basic nonovertime workday may not exceed 8 hours;
<br>
<br>(E) the occurrence of holidays may not affect the designation of the basic workweek; and
<br>
<br>(F) breaks in working hours of more than 1 hour may not be scheduled in a basic workday.
<br>
<br>(4) Notwithstanding paragraph (3) of this subsection, the head of an Executive agency, a military department, or of the government of the District of Columbia may establish special tours of duty, of not less than 40 hours, to enable employees to take courses in nearby colleges, universities, or other educational institutions that will equip them for more effective work in the agency. Premium pay may not be paid to an employee solely because his special tour of duty established under this paragraph results in his working on a day or at a time of day for which premium pay is otherwise authorized.
<br>
<br>(5) The Architect of the Capitol may apply this subsection to employees under the Office of the Architect of the Capitol or the Botanic Garden. The Librarian of Congress may apply this subsection to employees under the Library of Congress.
<br>
<br>(b)(1) For the purpose of this subsection, "agency" and "employee" have the meanings given them by section 5541 of this title.
<br>
<br>(2) To the maximum extent practicable, the head of an agency shall schedule the time to be spent by an employee in a travel status away from his official duty station within the regularly scheduled workweek of the employee.
<br>
<br>(c) The Office of Personnel Management may prescribe regulations, subject to the approval of the President, necessary for the administration of this section insofar as this section affects employees in or under an Executive agency.

<br>
<br>In subsection (a), the words "in the departmental and the field services" are omitted as unnecessary.
<br>
<br>In subsections (a) and (b), the words "an Executive agency, a military department" are coextensive with and substituted for "the several departments and independent establishments and agencies in the executive branch, including Government-owned or controlled corporations" and "such department, establishment, or agency" in view of the definitions in sections 105 and 102. The words "a military department" are included to preserve the application of the source law. Before enactment of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (63 Stat. 578), the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force were Executive departments. The National Security Act Amendments of 1949 established the Department of Defense as an Executive Department including the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force as military departments, not as Executive departments. However, the source law for this section which was in effect in 1949, remained applicable to the Secretaries of the military departments by virtue of section 12(g) of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (63 Stat. 591), which is set out in the reviser's note for section 301.
<br>
<br>Subsection (d) is added on authority of former sections 901(d) and 2358(a) (as applicable to the Federal Employees Pay Act of 1945, as amended) which are carried into section 5541, and to include individuals employed by the government of the District of Columbia as they are not included in the definition of "employee" in section 2105.
<br>
<br>Subsection (e) is added on authority of former section 945, which is carried into section 5548. The words "an Executive agency" are substituted for "the executive branch of the Government" to conform to the definition in section 105. Applicability of this section to employees of the General Accounting Office is based on former section 933a.
<br>
<br>Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.

<br>
<br>In subsection (a)(4), the words "without regard to the requirements of such paragraph" are omitted as redundant in view of the words "notwithstanding paragraph (3) of this subsection" at the beginning thereof. The words "an Executive agency, a military department" are coextensive with and substituted for "each such department, establishment, or agency" and to conform to subsections (a)(2) and (a)(3). The words "officers" and "officer" are omitted as included in "employees" and "employee". The word "pay" is substituted for "compensation" to conform to the style of title 5, United States Code.
<br>
<br>Subsection (b)(1) is added on authority of former sections 901 and 902 of title 5, which are now codified in 5 U.S.C. 5541.
<br>
<br>In subsection (b)(2), the words "head of an agency" are substituted for "head of any department, independent establishment, or agency, including Government-owned or controlled corporations, or of the municipal government of the District of Columbia, or the head of any legislative or judicial agency to which this title applies" to conform to the definition of "agency" in 5 U.S.C. 5541, which is made applicable to this subsection by subsection (b)(1). The word "officer" is omitted as included in "employee".

<br>
<br>"Section 1. This Act [enacting section 5550a of this title and this note] may be cited as the 'Federal Employees Flexible and Compressed Work Schedules Act of 1978'.
<br>"congressional findings
<br>
<br>"Sec. 2. The Congress finds that new trends in the usage of 4-day workweeks, flexible work hours, and other variations in workday and workweek schedules in the private sector appear to show sufficient promise to warrant carefully designed, controlled, and evaluated experimentation by Federal agencies to determine whether and in what situations such varied work schedules can be successfully used by Federal agencies on a permanent basis. The Congress also finds that there should be sufficient flexibility in the work schedules of Federal employees to allow such employees to meet the obligations of their faith.

<br>"Sec. 4. (a)(1) Within 180 days after the effective date of this section, and subject to the requirements of section 302 and the terms of any written agreement referred to in section 302(a), the Commission shall establish a program which provides for the conducting of experiments by the Commission under titles I and II of this Act. Such experimental program shall cover a sufficient number of positions throughout the executive branch, and a sufficient range of worktime alternatives, as to provide an adequate basis on which to evaluate the effectiveness and desirability of permanently maintaining flexible or compressed work schedules within the executive branch.
<br>
<br>"(2) Each agency may conduct one or more experiments under titles I and II of this Act. Such experiments shall be subject to such regulations as the Commission may prescribe under section 305 of this Act.
<br>
<br>"(b) The Commission shall, not later than 90 days after the effective date of this section, establish a master plan which shall contain guidelines and criteria by which the Commission will study and evaluate experiments conducted under titles I and II of this Act. Such master plan shall provide for the study and evaluation of experiments within a sample of organizations of different size, geographic location, and functions and activities, sufficient to insure adequate evaluation of the impact of varied work schedules on—
<br>
<br>"(1) the efficiency of Government operations;
<br>
<br>"(2) mass transit facilities and traffic;
<br>
<br>"(3) levels of energy consumption;
<br>
<br>"(4) service to the public;
<br>
<br>"(5) increased opportunities for full-time and part-time employment; and
<br>
<br>"(6) individuals and families generally.
<br>
<br>"(c) The Commission shall provide educational material, and technical aids and assistance, for use by an agency before and during the period such agency is conducting experiments under this Act [enacting section 5550a of this title and this note].
<br>
<br>"(d) If the head of an agency determines that the implementation of an experimental program referred to in subsection (a) would substantially disrupt the agency in carrying out its functions, such agency head shall request the Commission to exempt such agency from the requirements of any experiment conducted by the Commission under subsection (a). Such request shall be accompanied by a report detailing the reasons for such determination. The Commission shall exempt an agency from such requirements only if it finds that including the agency within the experiment would not be in the best interest of the public, the Government, or the employees. The filing of such a request with the Commission shall exclude the agency from the experiment until the Commission has made its determination or until 180 days after the date the request is filed, whichever first occurs.

<br>"definitions
<br>
<br>"Sec. 101. For purposes of this title—
<br>
<br>"(1) the term 'credit hours' means any hours, within a flexible schedule established under this title, which are in excess of an employee's basic work requirement and which the employee elects to work so as to vary the length of a workweek or a workday; and

<br>
<br>"(2) designated hours during which an employee on such a schedule may elect the time of such employee's arrival at and departure from work, solely for such purpose or, if and to the extent permitted, for the purpose of accumulating credit hours to reduce the length of the workweek or another workday.
<br>
<br>An election by an employee referred to in paragraph (2) shall be subject to limitations generally prescribed to ensure that the duties and requirements of the employee's position are fulfilled.
<br>
<br>"(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act [enacting section 5550a of this title and this note], but subject to the terms of any written agreement under section 302(a)—
