<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary, acting through the Under Secretary for Preparedness and in coordination with the Commandant of the Coast Guard, shall establish a Port Security Exercise Program (referred to in this section as the "Exercise Program") for the purpose of testing and evaluating the capabilities of Federal, State, local, and foreign governments, commercial seaport personnel and management, governmental and nongovernmental emergency response providers, the private sector, or any other organization or entity, as the Secretary determines to be appropriate, to prevent, prepare for, mitigate against, respond to, and recover from acts of terrorism, natural disasters, and other emergencies at facilities required to submit a plan under section 70103(c) of title 46.
<br>(b) Requirements
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall ensure that the Exercise Program—
<br>
<br>(1) conducts, on a periodic basis, port security exercises at such facilities that are—
<br>
<br>(A) scaled and tailored to the needs of each facility;
<br>
<br>(B) live, in the case of the most at-risk facilities;
<br>
<br>(C) as realistic as practicable and based on current risk assessments, including credible threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences;
<br>
<br>(D) consistent with the National Incident Management System, the National Response Plan, the National Infrastructure Protection Plan, the National Preparedness Guidance, the National Preparedness Goal, the National Maritime Transportation Security Plan, and other such national initiatives;
<br>
<br>(E) evaluated against clear and consistent performance measures;
<br>
<br>(F) assessed to learn best practices, which shall be shared with appropriate Federal, State, and local officials, commercial seaport personnel and management, governmental and nongovernmental emergency response providers, and the private sector; and
<br>
<br>(G) followed by remedial action in response to lessons learned; and
<br>
<br>(2) assists State and local governments and facilities in designing, implementing, and evaluating exercises that—
<br>
<br>(A) conform to the requirements of paragraph (1); and
<br>
<br>(B) are consistent with any applicable Area Maritime Transportation Security Plan and State or Urban Area Homeland Security Plan.
<br>(c) Improvement plan
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall establish a port security exercise improvement plan process to—
<br>
<br>(1) identify and analyze each port security exercise for lessons learned and best practices;
<br>
<br>(2) disseminate lessons learned and best practices to participants in the Exercise Program;
<br>
<br>(3) monitor the implementation of lessons learned and best practices by participants in the Exercise Program; and
<br>
<br>(4) conduct remedial action tracking and long-term trend analysis.

<br>Part B—Port Operations
<br>§921. Domestic radiation detection and imaging
<br>(a) Scanning containers
<br>
<br>Subject to section 1318 of title 19, not later than December 31, 2007, all containers entering the United States through the 22 ports through which the greatest volume of containers enter the United States by vessel shall be scanned for radiation. To the extent practicable, the Secretary shall deploy next generation radiation detection technology.
<br>(b) Strategy
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall develop a strategy for the deployment of radiation detection capabilities that includes—
<br>
<br>(1) a risk-based prioritization of ports of entry at which radiation detection equipment will be deployed;
<br>
<br>(2) a proposed timeline of when radiation detection equipment will be deployed at each port of entry identified under paragraph (1);
<br>
<br>(3) the type of equipment to be used at each port of entry identified under paragraph (1), including the joint deployment and utilization of radiation detection equipment and nonintrusive imaging equipment;
<br>
<br>(4) standard operating procedures for examining containers with such equipment, including sensor alarming, networking, and communications and response protocols;
<br>
<br>(5) operator training plans;
<br>
<br>(6) an evaluation of the environmental health and safety impacts of nonintrusive imaging technology and a radiation risk reduction plan, in consultation with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, that seeks to minimize radiation exposure of workers and the public to levels as low as reasonably achievable;
<br>
<br>(7) the policy of the Department for using nonintrusive imaging equipment in tandem with radiation detection equipment; and
<br>
<br>(8) a classified annex that—
<br>
<br>(A) details plans for covert testing; and
<br>
<br>(B) outlines the risk-based prioritization of ports of entry identified under paragraph (1).
<br>(c) Standards
<br>
<br>The Secretary, acting through the Director for Domestic Nuclear Detection 1 and in collaboration with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, shall publish technical capability standards and recommended standard operating procedures for the use of nonintrusive imaging and radiation detection equipment in the United States. Such standards and procedures—
<br>
<br>(1) should take into account relevant standards and procedures utilized by other Federal departments or agencies as well as those developed by international bodies; and
<br>
<br>(2) shall not be designed so as to endorse specific companies or create sovereignty conflicts with participating countries.
<br>(d) Implementation
<br>

<br>(e) Expansion to other United States ports of entry
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>As soon as practicable after—
<br>
<br>(A) implementation of the program for the examination of containers for radiation at ports of entry described in subsection (a); and
<br>
<br>(B) submission of the strategy developed under subsection (b),
<br>
<br>but not later than December 31, 2008, the Secretary shall expand the strategy developed under subsection (b), in a manner consistent with the requirements of subsection (b), to provide for the deployment of radiation detection capabilities at all other United States ports of entry not covered by the strategy developed under subsection (b).
<br>(2) Risk assessment
<br>
<br>In expanding the strategy under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall identify and assess the risks to those other ports of entry in order to determine what equipment and practices will best mitigate the risks.
<br>(f) Intermodal Rail Radiation Detection Test Center
<br>(1) Establishment
<br>
<br>In accordance with subsection (b), and in order to comply with this section, the Secretary shall establish an Intermodal Rail Radiation Detection Test Center (referred to in this subsection as the "Test Center").
<br>(2) Projects
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall conduct multiple, concurrent projects at the Test Center to rapidly identify and test concepts specific to the challenges posed by on-dock rail.
<br>(3) Location
<br>
<br>The Test Center shall be located within a public port facility at which a majority of the containerized cargo is directly laden from (or unladen to) on-dock, intermodal rail.
