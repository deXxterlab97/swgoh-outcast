<br>The woman, who at the return of the month, hath her issue of blood, shall be sepa- rated seven days.
<br>Every one that toucheth her, shall be un- clean until the evening.
<br>And every thing that she sleepeth on, or that she sitteth on in the days of her separation, shall be defiled.
<br>He that toucheth her bed shall wash his clothes: and being himself washed with water,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>shall be unclean until the evening.
<br>Whosoever shall touch any vessel on which she sitteth, shall wash his clothes: and himself being washed with water, shall be defiled until the evening.
<br>If a man copulateth with her in the time of her flowers, he shall be unclean seven days: and every bed on which he shall sleep, shall be defiled.
<br>The woman that hath still issue of blood many days out of her ordinary time, or that ceaseth not to flow after the monthly courses, as long as she is subject to this disease, shall be unclean, in the same manner as if she were in her flowers.
<br>Every bed on which she sleepeth, and every vessel on which she sitteth, shall be defiled.
<br>Whosoever toucheth them shall wash his clothes: and himself being washed with water, shall be unclean until the evening.
<br>If the blood stop and cease to run, she shall count seven days of her purification:
<br>And on the eighth day she shall offer for herself to the priest, two turtles, or two young pigeons, at the door of the tabernacle of the tes- timony:
<br>And he shall offer one for sin, and the other for a holocaust, and he shall pray for her before the Lord, and for the issue of her uncleanness.
<br>You shall teach therefore the children of Israel to take heed of uncleanness, that they may not die in their filth, when they shall have defiled my tabernacle that is among them.
<br>This is the law of him that hath the issue of seed, and that is defiled by copulation.
<br>And of the woman that is separated in her monthly times, or that hath a continual issue of blood, and of the man that sleepeth with her.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 16
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, after the death of the two sons of Aaron when they were slain upon their offering strange fire:
<br>And he commanded him, saying: Speak to Aaron thy brother, that he enter not at all into the sanctuary, which is within the veil before the propitiatory, with which the ark is covered, lest he die, (for I will appear in a cloud over the or- acle),
<br>Unless he first do these things. He shall offer a calf for sin, and a ram for a holocaust.
<br>He shall be vested with a linen tunick: he shall cover his nakedness with linen breeches: he shall be girded with a linen girdle, and he shall put a linen mitre upon his head. For these are holy vestments: all which he shall put on, after he is washed.
<br>And he shall receive from the whole multi- tude of the children of Israel two buck goats for sin, and one ram for a holocaust.
<br>And when he hath offered the cattle and prayed for himself and for his own house:
<br>He shall make the two buck goats to stand before the Lord in the door of the tabernacle of the testimony.
<br>And casting lots upon them both, one to be offered to the Lord, and the other to be the emissary goat:
<br>That whose lot fell to be offered to the Lord, he shall offer for sin.
<br>But that whose lot was to be the emissary goat, he shall present before the Lord, that he may pour prayers upon him, and let him go into the wilderness.
<br>After these things are duly celebrated, he shall offer the calf: and praying for himself and for his own house, he shall immolate it.
<br>And taking the censer, which he hath filled
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>with the burning coals of the altar, and taking up with his hands the compounded perfume for incense, he shall go in within the veil into the holy place:
<br>That when the perfumes are put upon the fire, the cloud and vapour thereof may cover the oracle, which is over the testimony, and he may not die.
<br>He shall take also of the blood of the calf, and sprinkle with his finger seven times towards the propitiatory to the east.
<br>And when he hath killed the buck goat for the sin of the people, he shall carry in the blood thereof within the veil, as he was commanded to do with the blood of the calf, that he may sprinkle it over against the oracle:
<br>And may expiate the sanctuary from the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and from their transgressions, and all their sins. Accord- ing to this rite shall he do to the tabernacle of the testimony, which is fixed among them in the midst of the filth of their habitation.
<br>Let no man be in the tabernacle when the high priest goeth into the sanctuary, to pray for himself and his house, and for the whole congre- gation of Israel, until he come out.
<br>And when he is come out to the altar that is before the Lord, let him pray for himself: and taking the blood of the calf, and of the buck goat, let him pour it upon the horns thereof round about.
<br>And sprinkling with his finger seven times, let him expiate, and sanctify it from the unclean- ness of the children of Israel.
<br>After he hath cleaned the sanctuary, and the tabernacle, and the altar, then let him offer the living goat.
<br>And putting both hands upon his head, let him confess all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their offences and sins. And
<br> 
<br>praying that they may light on its head, he shall turn him out by a man ready for it, into the desert.
<br>And when the goat hath carried all their iniquities into an uninhabited land, and shall be let go into the desert:
<br>Aaron shall return into the tabernacle of the testimony, and putting off the vestments, which he had on him before when he entered into the sanctuary, and leaving them there,
<br>He shall wash his flesh in the holy place, and shall put on his own garments. And after that he is come out and hath offered his own holocaust, and that of the people, he shall pray both for himself, and for the people.
<br>And the fat that is offered for sins, he shall burn on the altar.
<br>But he that hath let go the emissary goat, shall wash his clothes, and his body with water, and so shall enter into the camp.
<br>But the calf and the buck goat, that were sacrificed for sin, and whose blood was carried into the sanctuary, to accomplish the atonement, they shall carry forth without the camp, and shall burn with fire: their skins and their flesh, and their dung.
<br>And whosoever burneth them shall wash his clothes, and flesh with water: and so shall enter into the camp.
<br>And this shall be to you an everlasting or- dinance.   The seventh month, the tenth day of the month, you shall afflict your souls, and shall do no work, whether it be one of your own coun- try, or a stranger that sojourneth among you.
<br>Upon this day shall be the expiation for you, and the cleansing from all your sins. You shall be cleansed before the Lord.
<br>For it is a sabbath of rest: and you shall afflict your souls by a perpetual religion.
<br>And the priest that is anointed, and whose
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>hands are consecrated to do the office of the priesthood in his father’s stead, shall make atonement. And he shall be vested with the linen robe and the holy vestments.
<br>And he shall expiate the sanctuary and the tabernacle of the testimony and the altar: the priest also and all the people.
<br>And this shall be an ordinance for ever, that you pray for the children of Israel, and for all their sins once a year. He did therefore as the Lord had commanded Moses.
<br>
<br>Chapter 17
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>2 Speak to Aaron and his sons, and to all the children of Israel, saying to them: This is the word, which the Lord hath commanded, saying: 3 Any man whosoever of the house of Israel, if he kill an ox, or a sheep, or a goat in the camp,
<br>or without the camp,
<br>And offer it not at the door of the tabernacle an oblation to the Lord, shall be guilty of blood. As if he had shed blood, so shall he perish from the midst of his people.
<br>Therefore the children of Israel shall bring to the priest their victims, which they kill in the field, that they may be sanctified to the Lord be- fore the door of the tabernacle of the testimony: and they may sacrifice them for peace offerings to the Lord.
<br>And the priest shall pour the blood upon the altar of the Lord, at the door of the tabernacle of the testimony: and shall burn the fat for a sweet odour to the Lord.
<br>And they shall no more sacrifice their vic- tims to devils, with whom they have committed fornication. It shall be an ordinance for ever to them and to their posterity.
<br> 
<br>And thou shalt say to them: The man of the house of Israel, and of the strangers who sojourn among you, that offereth a holocaust or a victim,
<br>And bringeth it not to the door of the taber- nacle of the testimony, that it may be offered to the Lord, shall perish from among his people.
<br>If any man whosoever of the house of Israel, and of the strangers that sojourn among them, eat blood, I will set my face against his soul, and will cut him off from among his people.
<br>Because the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you, that you may make atonement with it upon the altar for your souls, and the blood may be for an expiation of the soul.
<br>Therefore I have said to the children of Israel: No soul of you, nor of the strangers that sojourn among you, shall eat blood.
<br>Any man whosoever of the children of Is- rael, and of the strangers that sojourn among you, if by hunting or fowling, he take a wild beast or a bird, which is lawful to eat, let him pour out its blood, and cover it with earth.
<br>For the life of all flesh is in the blood. Therefore I said to the children of Israel: you shall not eat the blood of any flesh at all, be- cause the life of the flesh is in the blood, and whosoever eateth it, shall be cut off.
<br>The soul that eateth that which died of itself, or has been caught by a beast, whether he be one of your own country or a stranger, shall wash his clothes and himself with water, and shall be defiled until the evening: and in this manner he shall be made clean.
<br>But if he do not wash his clothes, and his body, he shall bear his iniquity.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 18
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: I am the Lord your God.
<br>You shall not do according to the custom of the land of Egypt, in which you dwelt: nei- ther shall you act according to the manner of the country of Chanaan, into which I will bring you. Nor shall you walk in their ordinances.
<br>You shall do my judgments, and shall ob- serve my precepts, and shall walk in them. I am the Lord your God.
<br>Keep my laws and my judgments: which if a man do, he shall live in them, I am the Lord.
<br>No man shall approach to her that is near of kin to him, to uncover her nakedness. I am the Lord.
<br>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father, or the nakedness of thy mother: she is thy mother, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
<br>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father’s wife: for it is the nakedness of thy father. 9 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy sister by father or by mother: whether born at
<br>home or abroad.
<br>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy son’s daughter, or thy daughter’s daughter: because it is thy own nakedness.
<br>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father’s wife’s daughter, whom she bore to thy father: and who is thy sister.
<br>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father’s sister: because she is the flesh of thy father.
<br>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother’s sister: because she is thy mother’s flesh.
<br>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father’s brother: neither shalt thou approach
<br> 
<br>to his wife, who is joined to thee by affinity.
<br>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter in law: because she is thy son’s wife, neither shalt thou discover her shame.
<br>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother’s wife: because it is the nakedness of thy brother.
<br>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy wife and her daughter. Thou shalt not take her son’s daughter or her daughter’s daughter, to discover her shame: because they are her flesh, and such copulation is incest.
<br>Thou shalt not take thy wife’s sister for a harlot, to rival her: neither shalt thou discover her nakedness, while she is yet living.
<br>Thou shalt not approach to a woman hav- ing her flowers: neither shalt thou uncover her nakedness.
<br>Thou shalt not lie with thy neighbour’s wife: nor be defiled with mingling of seed.
<br>Thou shalt not give any of thy seed to be consecrated to the idol Moloch, nor defile the name of thy God. I am the Lord.
<br>Thou shalt not lie with mankind as with womankind: because it is an abomination.
<br>Thou shalt not copulate with any beast: neither shalt thou be defiled with it. A woman shall not lie down to a beast, nor copulate with it: because it is a heinous crime.
<br>Defile not yourselves with any of these things with which all the nations have been de- filed, which I will cast out before you,
<br>And with which the land is defiled: the abominations of which I will visit, that it may vomit out its inhabitants.
<br>Keep ye my ordinances and my judgments: and do not any of these abominations. Neither any of your own nation, nor any stranger that sojourneth among you.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>For all these detestable things the inhab- itants of the land have done, that were before you, and have defiled it.
<br>Beware then, lest in like manner, it vomit you also out, if you do the like things: as it vom- ited out the nation that was before you.
<br>Every soul that shall commit any of these abominations, shall perish from the midst of his people.
<br>Keep my commandments. Do not the things which they have done, that have been be- fore you: and be not defiled therein. I am the Lord your God.
<br>
<br>Chapter 19
<br>The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>Speak to all the congregation of the children of Israel. And thou shalt say to them: Be ye holy, because I the Lord your God am holy.
<br>Let every one fear his father, and his mother.
<br>Keep my sabbaths. I am the Lord your God.
<br>Turn ye not to idols: nor make to yourselves molten gods. I am the Lord your God.
<br>If ye offer in sacrifice a peace offering to the Lord, that he may be favourable:
<br>You shall eat it on the same day it was of- fered, and the next day. And whatsoever shall be left until the third day, you shall burn with fire.
<br>If after two days any man eat thereof, he shall be profane and guilty of impiety:
<br>And shall bear his iniquity, because he hath defiled the holy thing of the Lord. And that soul shall perish from among his people.
<br>When thou reapest the corn of thy land, thou shalt not cut down all that is on the face of the earth to the very ground: nor shalt thou gather the ears that remain.
<br> 
<br>Neither shalt thou gather the bunches and grapes that fall down in thy vineyard: but shalt leave them to the poor and the strangers to take. I am the Lord your God.
<br>You shall not steal. You shall not lie: nei- ther shall any man deceive his neighbour.
<br>Thou shalt not swear falsely by my name, nor profane the name of thy God. I am the Lord. 13 Thou shalt not calumniate thy neighbour, nor oppress him by violence. The wages of him that hath been hired by thee shall not abide with
<br>thee until the morning.
<br>Thou shalt not speak evil of the deaf, nor put a stumbling block before the blind: but thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, because I am the Lord.
<br>Thou shalt not do that which is unjust, nor judge unjustly. Respect not the person of the poor: nor honour the countenance of the mighty. But judge thy neighbour according to justice.
<br>Thou shalt not be a detractor nor a whis- perer among the people. Thou shalt not stand against the blood of thy neighbour. I am the Lord.
<br>Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart: But reprove him openly, lest thou incur sin through him.
<br>Seek not revenge, nor be mindful of the injury of thy citizens. Thou shalt love thy friend as thyself. I am the Lord.
<br>Keep ye my laws. Thou shalt not make thy cattle to gender with beasts of any other kind. Thou shalt not sow thy field with different seeds. Thou shalt not wear a garment that is woven of two sorts.
<br>If a man carnally lie with a woman that is a bondservant and marriageable, and yet not redeemed with a price, nor made free: they both shall be scourged: and they shall not be put to death, because she was not a free woman.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>And for his trespass he shall offer a ram to the Lord, at the door of the tabernacle of the testimony.
<br>And the priest shall pray for him: and for his sin before the Lord: and he shall have mercy on him, and the sin shall be forgiven.
<br>When you shall be come into the land, and shall have planted in it fruit trees, you shall take away the firstfruits of them. The fruit that comes forth shall be unclean to you: neither shall you eat of them.
<br>But in the fourth year, all their fruit shall be sanctified, to the praise of the Lord.
<br>And in the fifth year you shall eat the fruits thereof, gathering the increase thereof. I am the Lord your God.
<br>You shall not eat with blood. You shall not divine nor observe dreams.
<br>Nor shall you cut your hair roundwise: nor shave your beard.
<br>You shall not make any cuttings in your flesh, for the dead: neither shall you make in yourselves any figures or marks. I am the Lord. 29 Make not thy daughter a common strum- pet, lest the land be defiled, and filled with
<br>wickedness.
<br>Keep ye my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary. I am the Lord.
<br>Go not aside after wizards: neither ask any thing of soothsayers, to be defiled by them. I am the Lord your God.
<br>Rise up before the hoary head, and honour the person of the aged man: and fear the Lord thy God. I am the Lord.
<br>If a stranger dwell in your land, and abide among you, do not upbraid hin:
<br>But let him be among you as one of the same country. And you shall love him as your- selves: for you were strangers in the land of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.
<br> 
<br>Do not any unjust thing in judgment, in rule, in weight, or in measure.
<br>Let the balance be just and the weights equal, the bushel just, and the sextary equal. I am the Lord your God, that brought you out of the land of Egypt.
<br>Keep all my precepts, and all my judg- ments: and do them. I am the Lord.
<br>
<br>Chapter 20
<br>
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>Thus shalt thou say to the children of Is- rael: If any man of the children Israel, or of the strangers that dwell in Israel, give of his seed to the idol Moloch, dying let him die. The people of the land shall stone him.
<br>And I will set my face against him:    and I will cut him off from the midst of his people, because he hath given of his seed to Moloch, and hath defiled my sanctuary, and profaned my holy name.
<br>And if the people of the land neglecting, and as it were little regarding my commandment, let alone the man that hath given of his seed to Moloch, and will not kill him:
<br>I will set my face against that man, and his kindred, and will cut off both him and all that consented with him, to commit fornication with Moloch, out of the midst of their people.
<br>The soul that shall go aside after magicians, and soothsayers, and shall commit fornication with them: I will set my face against that soul, and destroy it out of the midst of its people.
<br>Sanctify yourselves, and be ye holy: because I am the Lord your God.
<br>Keep my precepts, and do them. I am the Lord that sanctify you.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>He that curseth his father, or mother, dy- ing let him die. He hath cursed his father, and mother: let his blood be upon him.
<br>If any man commit adultery with the wife of another, and defile his neighbour’s wife: let them be put to death, both the adulterer and the adulteress.
<br>If a man lie with his stepmother, and dis- cover the nakedness of his father, let them both be put to death: their blood be upon them.
<br>If any man lie with his daughter in law: let both die, because they have done a heinous crime. Their blood be upon them.
<br>If any one lie with a man as with a woman, both have committed an abomination: let them be put to death. Their blood be upon them.
<br>If any man after marrying the daughter, marry her mother, he hath done a heinous crime. He shall be burnt alive with them: neither shall so great an abomination remain in the midst of you.
<br>He that shall copulate with any beast or cattle, dying let him die: the beast also ye shall kill.
<br>The woman that shall lie under any beast, shall be killed together with the same. Their blood be upon them.
<br>If any man take his sister, the daughter of his father, or the daughter of his mother, and see her nakedness, and she behold her brother’s shame: they have committed a crime. They shall be slain, in the sight of their people, because they have discovered one another’s nakedness. And they shall bear their iniquity.
<br>If any man lie with a woman in her flowers, and uncover her nakedness, and she open the fountain of her blood: both shall be destroyed out of the midst of their people.
<br>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy aunt by thy mother, and of thy aunt by thy
<br> 
<br>father. He that doth this, hath uncovered the shame of his own flesh: both shall bear their iniquity.
<br>If any man lie with the wife of his uncle by the father, or of his uncle by the mother, and uncover the shame of his near akin, both shall bear their sin. They shall die without children.
<br>He that marrieth his brother’s wife, doth an unlawful thing: he hath uncovered his brother’s nakedness. They shall be without chil- dren.
<br>Keep my laws and my judgments, and do them: lest the land into which you are to enter to dwell therein, vomit you also out.
<br>Walk not after the laws of the nations, which I will cast out before you. For they have done all these things: and therefore I abhorred them.
<br>But to you I say: Possess their land which I will give you for an inheritance, a land flowing with milk and honey. I am the Lord your God, who have separated you from other people.
<br>Therefore do you also separate the clean beast from the unclean, and the clean fowl from the unclean. Defile not your souls with beasts, or birds, or any things that move on the earth, and which I have shewn you to be unclean:
<br>You shall be holy unto me, because I the Lord am holy: and I have separated you from other people, that you should be mine.
<br>A man, or woman, in whom there is a pythonical or divining spirit, dying let them die. They shall stone them. Their blood be upon them.
<br>
<br>Chapter 21
<br>The Lord said also to Moses: Speak to the priests the sons of Aaron, and thou shalt say for them:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Let not a priest incur an uncleanness at the death of his citizens.
<br>But only for his kin, such as are near in blood: that is to say, for his father and for his mother, and for his son, and for his daughter, for his brother also:
<br>And for a maiden sister, who hath had no husband.
<br>But not even for the prince of his people shall he do any thing that may make him unclean.
<br>Neither shall they shave their head, nor their beard, nor make incisions in their flesh.
<br>They shall be holy to their God, and shall not profane his name. For they offer the burnt offering of the Lord, and the bread of their God: and therefore they shall be holy.
<br>They shall not take to wife a harlot or a vile prostitute, nor one that has been put away from her husband: because they are consecrated to their God,
<br>And offer the loaves of proposition. Let them therefore be holy because I also am holy: the Lord, who sanctify them.
<br>If the daughter of a priest be taken in whore- dom and dishonour the name of her father, she shall be burnt with fire.
<br>The high priest, that is to say, the priest who is the greatest among his brethren, upon whose head the oil of unction hath been poured; and whose hands have been consecrated for the priesthood; and who hath been vested with the holy vestments. He shall not uncover his head: he shall not rend his garments.
<br>Nor shall he go in at all to any dead person: not even for his father, or his mother, shall he be defiled.
<br>Neither shall he go out of the holy places, lest he defile the sanctuary of the Lord: because the oil of the holy unction of his God is upon him. I am the Lord.
<br> 
<br>He shall take a virgin unto his wife.
<br>But a widow or one that is divorced, or defied, or a harlot, he shall not take: but a maid of his own people.
<br>He shall not mingle the stock of his kindred with the common people of this nation: for I am the Lord who sanctify him.
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>Say to Aaron: Whosoever of thy seed throughout their families, hath a blemish, he shall not offer bread to his God.
<br>Neither shall he approach to minister to him: If he be blind; if he be lame; if he have a little, or a great, or a crooked nose;
<br>If his foot, or if his hand be broken;
<br>If he be crookbacked; or blear eyed; or have a pearl in his eye, or a continual scab, or a dry scurf in his body, or a rupture.
<br>Whosoever of the seed of Aaron the priest hath a blemish: he shall not approach to offer sacrifices to the Lord, nor bread to his God.
<br>He shall eat nevertheless of the loaves that are offered in the sanctuary.
<br>Yet so that he enter not within the veil, nor approach to the altar: because he hath a blemish, and he must not defile my sanctuary. I am the Lord who sanctify them.
<br>Moses, therefore spoke to Aaron, and to his sons and to all Israel, all the things that had been commanded him.
<br>
<br>Chapter 22
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses saying:
<br>2 Speak to Aaron and to his sons, that they beware of those things that are consecrated of the children of Israel: and defile not the name of the things sanctified to me, which they offer. I am the Lord.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>3	Say to them and to their posterity: Ev- ery man of your race, that approacheth to those things that are consecrated, and which the chil- dren of Israel have offered to the Lord, in whom there is uncleanness, shall perish before the Lord. I am the Lord.
<br>4	The man of the seed of Aaron, that is a leper, or that suffereth a running of the seed, shall not eat of those things that are sanctified to me, until he be healed. He that toucheth any thing unclean by occasion of the dead: and he whose seed goeth from him as in generation:
<br>5	And he that toucheth a creeping thing, or any unclean thing, the touching of which is de- filing:
<br>6	Shall be unclean until the evening, and shall not eat those things that are sanctified. But when he hath washed his flesh with water,
<br>7	And the sun is down, then being purified, he shall eat of the sanctified things, because it is his meat.
<br>8	That which dieth of itself, and that which was taken by a beast, they shall not eat, nor be defiled therewith. I am the Lord.
<br>9	Let them keep my precepts, that they may not fall into sin, and die in the sanctuary, when they shall have defiled it. I am the Lord who sanctify them.
<br>10	No stranger shall eat of the sanctified things: a sojourner of the priests, or a hired ser- vant, shall not eat of them.
<br>11	But he whom the priest hath bought, and he that is his servant, born in his house, these shall eat of them.
<br>12	If the daughter of a priest be married to any of the people, she shall not eat of those things that are sanctified nor of the firstfruits.
<br>13	But if she be a widow, or divorced, and having no children return to her father’s house, she shall eat of her father’s meats, as she was
<br> 
<br>wont to do when she was a maid. No stranger hath leave to eat of them.
<br>14	He that eateth of the sanctified things through ignorance, shall add the fifth part with that which he ate, and shall give it to the priest into the sanctuary.
<br>15	And they shall not profane the sanctified things of the children of Israel, which they offer to the Lord:
<br>16	Lest perhaps they bear the iniquity of their trespass, when they shall have eaten the sancti- fied things. I am the Lord who sanctify them.
<br>17	And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>18	Speak to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: The man of the house of Israel, and of the strangers who dwell with you, that offereth his oblation, either paying his vows, or offering of his own accord, whatsoever it be which he presenteth for a holocaust of the Lord,
<br>19	To be offered by you: it shall be a male without blemish of the beeves, or of the sheep, or of the goats.
<br>20	If it have a blemish you shall not offer it: neither shall it be acceptable.
<br>21	The man that offereth a victim of peace offerings to the Lord, either paying his vows, or offering of his own accord, whether of beeves or of sheep, shall offer it without blemish, that it may be acceptable. There shall be no blemish in it.
<br>22	If it be blind, or broken, or have a scar or blisters, or a scab, or a dry scurf: you shall not offer them to the Lord, nor burn any thing of them upon the Lord’s altar.
<br>23	An ox or a sheep, that hath the ear and the tail cut off, thou mayst offer voluntarily: but a vow may not be paid with them.
<br>24	you shall not offer to the Lord any beast that hath the testicles bruised, or crushed, or cut
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>and taken away: neither shall you do any such things in your land.
<br>25	you shall not offer bread to your God, from the hand of a stranger, nor any other thing that he would give: because they are all corrupted, and defiled. You shall not receive them.
<br>26	And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>27	When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, they shall be seven days under the udder of their dam: but the eighth day, and thenceforth, they may be offered to the Lord.
<br>28	Whether it be a cow, or a sheep, they shall not be sacrificed the same day with their young ones.
<br>29	If you immolate a victim for thanksgiving to the Lord, that he may be favourable,
<br>30	You shall eat it the same day. There shall not any of it remain until the morning of the next day. I am the Lord.
<br>31	Keep my commandments, and do them. I am the Lord.
<br>32	Profane not my holy name, that I may be sanctified in the midst of the children of Israel. I am the Lord who sanctify you:
<br>33	And who brought you out of the land of Egypt, that I might be your God. I am the Lord.
<br>
<br>Chapter 23
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: These are the feasts of the Lord, which you shall call holy.
<br>Six days shall ye do work: the seventh day, because it is the rest of the sabbath, shall be called holy. You shall do no work on that day: it is the sabbath of the Lord in all your habitations. 4 These also are the holy days of the Lord,
<br>which you must celebrate in their seasons.
<br> 
<br>The first month, the fourteenth day of the month at evening, is the phase of the Lord.
<br>And the fifteenth day of the same month is the solemnity of the unleavened bread of the Lord. Seven days shall you eat unleavened bread.
<br>The first day shall be most solemn unto you, and holy: you shall do no servile work therein.
<br>But you shall offer sacrifice in fire to the Lord seven days. And the seventh day shall be more solemn, and more holy: and you shall do no servile work therein.
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: When you shall have entered into the land which I will give you, and shall reap your corn, you shall bring sheaves of ears, the firstfruits of your harvest to the priest.
<br>Who shall lift up the sheaf before the Lord, the next day after the sabbath, that it may be acceptable for you, and shall sanctify it.
<br>And on the same day that the sheaf is con- secrated, a lamb without blemish of the first year shall be killed for a holocaust of the Lord.
<br>And the libations shall be offered with it: two tenths of flour tempered with oil, for a burnt offering of the Lord, and a most sweet odour. Libations also of wine, the fourth part of a hin. 14 You shall not eat either bread, or parched corn, or frumenty or the harvest, until the day that you shall offer thereof to your God. It is a precept for ever throughout your generations,
<br>and all your dwellings.
<br>You shall count therefore from the morrow after the sabbath, wherein you offered the sheaf of firstfruits, seven full weeks.
<br>Even unto the morrow after the seventh week be expired, that is to say, fifty days: and so you shall offer a new sacrifice to the Lord.
<br>Out of all your dwellings, two loaves of the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>firstfruits, of two tenths of flour leavened, which you shall bake for the firstfruits of the Lord.
<br>And you shall offer with the loaves seven lambs without blemish of the first year, and one calf from the herd, and they shall be for a holo- caust with their two rams: and they shall be for a holocaust with their libations for a most sweet odour to the Lord.
<br>You shall offer also a buck goat for sin, and two lambs of the first year for sacrifices of peace offerings.
<br>And when the priest hath lifted them up with the loaves of the firstfruits before the Lord, they shall fall to his use.
<br>And you shall call this day most solemn, and most holy. You shall do no servile work therein. It shall be an everlasting ordinance in all your dwellings and generations.
<br>And when you reap the corn of your land, you shall not cut it to the very ground: nei- ther shall you gather the ears that remain. But you shall leave them for the poor and for the strangers. I am the Lord your God.
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>Say to the children of Israel: The seventh month, on the first day of the month, you shall keep a sabbath, a memorial, with the sound of trumpets, and it shall be called holy.
<br>You shall do no servile work therein, and you shall offer a holocaust to the Lord.
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>Upon the tenth day of this seventh month shall be the day of atonement. It shall be most solemn, and shall be called holy: and you shall await your souls on that day, and shall offer a holocaust to the Lord.
<br>You shall do no servile work in the time of this day: because it is a day of propitiation, that the Lord your God may be merciful unto you.
<br> 
<br>Every soul that is not afflicted on this day, shall perish from among his people.
<br>And every soul that shall do any work, the same will I destroy from among his people.
<br>You shall do no work therefore on that day: it shall be an everlasting ordinance unto you in all your generations, and dwellings.
<br>It is a sabbath of rest, and you shall af- flict your souls beginning on the ninth day of the month. From evening until evening you shall celebrate your sabbaths.
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>Say to the children of Israel: From the fif- teenth day of this same seventh month, shall be kept the feast of tabernacles, seven days to the Lord.
<br>The first day shall be called most solemn and most holy: you shall do no servile work therein. And seven days you shall offer holo- causts to the Lord.
<br>The eighth day also shall be most solemn and most holy: and you shall offer holocausts to the Lord. For it is the day of assembly and con- gregation. You shall do no servile work therein. 37 These are the feasts of the Lord which you shall call most solemn and most holy, and shall offer on them oblations to the Lord: holocausts and libations according to the rite of every day. 38 Besides the sabbaths of the Lord, and your gifts, and those things that you offer by vow, or
<br>which you shall give to the Lord voluntarily.
<br>So from the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you shall have gathered in all the fruits of your land, you shall celebrate the feast of the Lord seven days. On the first day and the eighth shall be a sabbath: that is a day of rest.
<br>And you shall take to you on the first day the fruits of the fairest tree, and branches of palm trees, and boughs of thick trees, and wil- lows of the brook: And you shall rejoice before
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>the Lord your God.
<br>And you shall keep the solemnity thereof seven days in the year. It shall be an everlasting ordinance in your generations. In the seventh month shall you celebrate this feast.
<br>And you shall dwell in bowers seven days. Every one that is of the race of Israel, shall dwell in tabernacles:
<br>That your posterity may know, that I made the children of Israel to dwell in tabernacles, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.
<br>And Moses spoke concerning the feasts of the Lord to the children of Israel.
<br>
<br>Chapter 24
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee the finest and clearest oil of olives, to furnish the lamps continually,
<br>Without the veil of the testimony in the tabernacle of the covenant. And Aaron shall set them from evening until morning before the Lord, by a perpetual service and rite in your gen- erations.
<br>They shall be set upon the most pure can- dlestick before the Lord continually.
<br>Thou shalt take also fine flour, and shalt bake twelve loaves thereof, two tenths shall be in every loaf.
<br>And thou shalt set them six and six, one against another, upon the most clean table be- fore the Lord.
<br>And thou shalt put upon them the clearest frankincense, that the bread may be for a memo- rial of the oblation of the Lord.
<br>Every sabbath they shall be changed before the Lord: being received of the children of Israel
<br> 
<br>by an everlasting covenant.
<br>And they shall be Aaron’s and his sons’, that they may eat them in the holy place: because it is most holy of the sacrifices of the Lord by a perpetual right.
<br>And behold there went out the son of a woman of Israel, whom she had of an Egyptian, among the children of Israel: and fell at words in the camp with a man of Israel.
<br>And when he had blasphemed the name, and had cursed it, he was brought to Moses. (Now his mother was called Salumith, the daugh- ter of Dabri, of the tribe of Dan.)
<br>And they put him into prison, till they might know what the Lord would command.
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses,
<br>Saying: Bring forth the blasphemer with- out the camp: and let them that heard him, put their hands upon his head: and let all the people stone him.
<br>And thou shalt speak to the children of Israel: The man that curseth his God, shall bear his sin:
<br>And he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, dying let him die. All the multitude shall stone him, whether he be a native or a stranger. He that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, dy- ing let him die.
<br>He that striketh and killeth a man: dying let him die.
<br>He that killeth a beast, shall make it good that is to say, shall give beast for beast.
<br>He that giveth a blemish to any of his neighbours: as he hath done, so shall it be done to him:
<br>Breach for breach, eye for ere, tooth for tooth, shall he restore. What blemish he gave, the like shall he be compelled to suffer.
<br>He that striketh a beast, shall render an- other. He that striketh a man shall be punished.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Let there be equal judgment among you, whether he be a stranger, or a native that of- fends: because I am the Lord your God.
<br>And Moses spoke to the children of Is- rael. And they brought forth him that had blas- phemed, without the camp: and they stoned him. And the children of Israel did as the Lord had commanded Moses.
<br>
<br>Chapter 25
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses in mount Sinai, saying:
<br>Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: When you shall have entered into the land which I will give you, observe the rest of the sabbath of the Lord.
<br>Six years thou shalt sow thy field and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and shalt gather the fruits thereof.
<br>But in the seventh year there shall be a sab- bath to the land, of the resting of the Lord. Thou shalt not sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard. 5 What the ground shall bring forth of itself, thou shalt not reap: neither shalt thou gather the grapes or the firstfruits as a vintage. For it
<br>is a year of rest to the land.
<br>But they shall be unto you for meat, to thee and to thy manservant, to thy maidservant and thy hireling, and to the strangers that sojourn with thee.
<br>All things that grow shall be meat to thy beasts and to thy cattle.
<br>Thou shalt also number to thee seven weeks of years: that is to say, seven times seven, which together make forty-nine years.
<br>And thou shalt sound the trumpet in the seventh month, the tenth day of the month, in the time of the expiation in all your land.
<br> 
<br>And thou shalt sanctify the fiftieth year, and shalt proclaim remission to all the inhabi- tants of thy land: for it is the year of jubilee. Every man shall return to his possession, and every one shall go back to his former family:
<br>Because it is the jubilee and the fiftieth year. You shall not sow, nor reap the things that grow in the field of their own accord, neither shall you gather the firstfruits of the vines,
<br>Because of the sanctification of the jubilee. But as they grow you shall presently eat them.
<br>In the year of the jubilee all shall return to their possessions.
<br>When thou shalt sell any thing to thy neighbour, or shalt buy of him: grieve not thy brother. But thou shalt buy of him according to the number of years from the jubilee.
<br>And he shall sell to thee according to the computation of the fruits.
<br>The more years remain after the jubilee, the more shall the price increase: and the less time is counted, so much the less shall the pur- chase cost. For he shall sell to thee the time of the fruits.
<br>Do not afflict your countrymen: but let every one fear his God. Because I am the Lord your God.
<br>Do my precepts, and keep my judgments, and fulfil them: that you may dwell in the land without any fear.
<br>And the ground may yield you its fruits, of which you may eat your fill, fearing no man’s invasion.
<br>But if you say: What shall we eat the sev- enth year, if we sow not, nor gather our fruits?
<br>I will give you my blessing the sixth year: and it shall yield the fruits of three years.
<br>And the eighth year you shall sow, and shall eat of the old fruits, until the ninth year: till new grow up, you shall eat the old store.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>The land also shall not be sold for ever: because it is mine, and you are strangers and sojourners with me.
<br>For which cause all the country of your pos- session shall be under the condition of redemp- tion.
<br>If thy brother being impoverished sell his little possession, and his kinsman will: he may redeem what he had sold.
<br>But if he have no kinsman, and he himself can find the price to redeem it:
<br>The value of the fruits shall be counted from that time when he sold it. And the overplus he shall restore to the buyer, and so shall receive his possession again.
<br>But if his hands find not the means to repay the price, the buyer shall have what he bought, until the year of the jubilee. For in that year all that is sold shall return to the owner, and to the ancient possessor.
<br>He that selleth a house within the walls of a city, shall have the liberty to redeem it, until one year be expired.
<br>If he redeem it not, and the whole year be fully out, the buyer shall possess it, and his posterity for ever, and it cannot be redeemed, not even in the jubilee.
<br>But if the house be in a village, that hath no walls, it shall be sold according to the same law as the fields. If it be not redeemed before, in the jubilee it shall return to the owner.
<br>The houses of Levites, which are in cities, may always be redeemed.
<br>If they be not redeemed, in the jubilee they shall all return to the owners: because the houses of the cities of the Levites are for their posses- sions among the children of Israel.
<br>But let not their suburbs be sold, because it is a perpetual possession.
<br>If thy brother be impoverished, and weak
<br> 
<br>of hand, and thou receive him as a stranger and sojourner, and he live with thee:
<br>Take not usury of him nor more than thou gavest. Fear thy God, that thy brother may live with thee.
<br>Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury: nor exact of him any increase of fruits.
<br>I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, that I might give you the land of Chanaan, and might be your God.
<br>If thy brother constrained by poverty, sell himself to thee: thou shalt not oppress him with the service of bondservants.
<br>But he shall be as a hireling, and a so- journer: he shall work with thee until the year of the jubilee.
<br>And afterwards he shall go out with his children: and shall return to his kindred and to the possession of his fathers.
<br>For they are my servants, and I brought them out of the land of Egypt: let them not be sold as bondmen.
<br>Afflict him not by might: but fear thy God.
<br>Let your bondmen, and your bondwomen, be of the nations that are round about you:
<br>And of the strangers that sojourn among you, or that were born of them in your land. These you shall have for servants:
<br>And by right of inheritance shall leave them to your posterity, and shall possess them for ever. But oppress not your brethren the children of Israel by might.
<br>If the hand of a stranger or a sojourner grow strong among you, and thy brother being impoverished sell himself to him, or to any of his race:
<br>After the sale he may be redeemed. He that will of his brethren shall redeem him:
<br>Either his uncle, or his uncle’s son, or his
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>kinsman, by blood, or by affinity. But if he him- self be able also, he shall redeem himself:
<br>Counting only the years from the time of his selling unto the year of the jubilee: and counting the money that he was sold for, accord- ing to the number of the years and the reckoning of a hired servant.
<br>If there be many years that remain until the jubilee, according to them shall he also repay the price.
<br>If few, he shall make the reckoning with him according to the number of the years: and shall repay to the buyer of what remaineth of the years.
<br>His wages being allowed for which he served before: he shall not afflict him violently in thy sight.
<br>And if by these means he cannot be re- deemed, in the year of the jubilee he shall go out with his children.
<br>For the children of Israel are my servants, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt.
<br>
<br>Chapter 26
<br>I am the Lord your God. You shall not make to yourselves any idol or graven thing: neither shall you erect pillars, nor set up a remarkable stone in your land, to adore it. For I am the Lord your God.
<br>Keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanc- tuary. I am the Lord.
<br>If you walk in my precepts, and keep my commandments, and do them, I will give you rain in due seasons.
<br>And the ground shall bring forth its increase: and the trees shall be filled with fruit.
<br>The threshing of your harvest shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach
<br> 
<br>unto the sowing time: and you shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land without fear.
<br>I will give peace in your coasts: you shall sleep, and there shall be none to make you afraid. I will take away evil beasts: and the sword shall not pass through your quarters.
<br>You shall pursue your enemies: and they shall fall before you.
<br>Five of yours shall pursue a hundred oth- ers: and a hundred of you ten thousand. Your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.
<br>I will look on you, and make you increase: you shall be multiplied, and I will establish my covenant with you.
<br>You shall eat the oldest of the old store: and, new coming on, you shall cast away the old. 11 I will set my tabernacle in the midst of you:
<br>and my soul shall not cast you off.
<br>I will walk among you, and will be your God: and you shall be my people.
<br>I am the Lord your God: who have brought you out of the land of the Egyptians, that you should not serve them: and who have broken the chains of your necks, that you might go upright. 14 But if you will not hear me, nor do all my
<br>commandments:
<br>15 If you despise my laws, and contemn my judgments so as not to do those things which are appointed by me, and to make void my covenant: 16 I also will do these things to you. I will quickly visit you with poverty, and burning heat, which shall waste your eyes, and consume your lives. You shall sow your seed in vain, which
<br>shall be devoured by your enemies.
<br>I will set my face against you, and you shall fall down before your enemies: and shall be made subject to them that hate you. You shall flee when no man pursueth you.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>But if you will not yet for all this obey me: I will chastise you seven times more for your sins. 19 And I will break the pride of your stub- bornness: and I will make to you the heaven
<br>above as iron, and the earth as brass.
<br>Your labour shall be spent in vain: the ground shall not bring forth her increase: nor the trees yield their fruit.
<br>If you walk contrary to me, and will not hearken to me, I will bring seven times more plagues upon you for your sins.
<br>And I will send in upon you the beasts of the field, to destroy you and your cattle, and make you few in number: and that your high- ways may be desolate.
<br>And if even so you will not amend, but will walk contrary to me:
<br>I also will walk contrary to you, and will strike you seven times for your sins.
<br>And I will bring in upon you the sword that shall avenge my covenant. And when you shall flee into the cities, I will send the pestilence in the midst of you. And you shall be delivered into the hands of your enemies,
<br>After I shall have broken the staff of your bread: so that ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and give it out by weight: and you shall eat, and shall not be filled,
<br>But if you will not for all this hearken to me, but will walk against me
<br>I will also go against you with opposite fury: and I will chastise you with seven plagues for your sins,
<br>So that you shall eat the flesh of your sons and of your daughters.
<br>I will destroy your high places, and break your idols. You shall fall among the ruins of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you.
<br>Insomuch that I will bring your cities to be a wilderness: and I will make your sanctuaries
<br> 
<br>desolate: and will receive no more your sweet odours.
<br>And I will destroy your land: and your enemies shall be astonished at it, when they shall be the inhabitants thereof.
<br>And I will scatter you among the Gentiles: and I will draw out the sword after you. And your land shall be desert, and your cities de- stroyed.
<br>Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths all the days of her desolation. When you shall be
<br>In the enemy’s land, she shall keep a sab- bath, and rest in the sabbaths of her desolation: because she did not rest in your sabbaths, when you dwelt therein.
<br>And as to them that shall remain of you I will send fear in their hearts in the countries of their enemies. The sound of a flying leaf shall terrify them: and they shall flee as it were from the sword. They shall fall, when no man pur- sueth them.
<br>And they shall every one fall upon their brethren as fleeing from wars: none of you shall dare to resist your enemies.
<br>You shall perish among the Gentiles: and an enemy’s land shall consume you.
<br>And if of them also some remain, they shall pine away in their iniquities, in the land of their enemies: and they shall be afflicted for the sins of their fathers, and their own.
<br>Until they confess their iniquities, and the iniquities of their ancestors, whereby they have transgressed against me, and walked contrary unto me.
<br>Therefore I also will walk against them, and bring them into their enemies’ land until their uncircumcised mind be ashamed. Then shall they pray for their sins.
<br>And I will remember my covenant, that I made with Jacob, and Isaac, and Abraham. I
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>will remember also the land:
<br>Which when she shall be left by them, shall enjoy her sabbaths, being desolate for them. But they shall pray for their sins, because they re- jected my judgments, and despised my laws.
<br>And yet for all that when they were in the land of their enemies, I did not cast them off altogether. Neither did I so despise them that they should be quite consumed: and I should make void my covenant with them. For I am the Lord their God.
<br>And I will remember my former covenant, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, in the sight of the Gentiles, to be their God. I am the Lord. These are the judgments, and precepts, and laws, which the Lord gave between him and the children of Israel, in mount Sinai, by the hand of Moses.
<br>
<br>Chapter 27
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: The man that shall have made a vow, and promised his soul to God, shall give the price according to estimation.
<br>If it be a man from twenty years old unto sixty years old, he shall give fifty sicles of silver, after the weight of the sanctuary:
<br>If a woman, thirty.
<br>But from the fifth year until the twentieth, a man shall give twenty sicles: a woman ten.
<br>From one month until the fifth year, for a male shall be given five sicles: for a female three. 7 A man that is sixty years old or upward,
<br>shall give fifteen sicles: a woman ten.
<br>8 If he be poor, and not able to pay the esti- mation, he shall stand before the priest: and as much as he shall value him at, and see him able
<br> 
<br>to pay, so much shall he give.
<br>But a beast that may be sacrificed to the Lord, if any one shall vow, shall be holy,
<br>And cannot be changed: that is to say, nei- ther a better for a worse, nor a worse for a better. And if he shall change it: both that which was changed, and that for which it was changed, shall be consecrated to the Lord.
<br>An unclean beast, which cannot be sacri- ficed to the Lord, if any man shall vow, shall be brought before the priest:
<br>Who judging whether it be good or bad, shall set the price.
<br>Which, if he that offereth it will give, he shall add above the estimation the fifth part.
<br>If a man shall vow his house, and sanctify it to the Lord, the priest shall consider it, whether it be good or bad: and it shall be sold according to the price, which he shall appoint.
<br>But if he that vowed, will redeem it, he shall give the fifth part of the estimation over and above: and shall have the house.
<br>And if he vow the field of his possession, and consecrate it to the Lord, the price shall be rated according to the measure of the seed. If the ground be sown with thirty bushels of barley, let it be sold for fifty sicles of silver.
<br>If he vow his field immediately from the year of jubilee that is beginning: as much as it may be worth, at so much it shall be rated.
<br>But if some time after, the priest shall reckon the money according to the number of years that remain until the jubilee, and the price shall be abated.
<br>And if he that had vowed, will redeem his field, he shall add the fifth part of the money of the estimation, and shall possess it.
<br>And if he will not redeem it, but it be sold to any other man, he that vowed it, may not redeem it any more.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>For when the day of jubilee cometh, it shall be sanctified to the Lord, and as a possession consecrated, pertaineth to the right of the priest. 22 If a field that was bought, and not of a man’s ancestors’ possession, be sanctified to the
<br>Lord:
<br>The priest shall reckon the price according to the number of years, unto the jubilee. And he that had vowed, shall give that to the Lord.
<br>But in the jubilee, it shall return to the former owner, who had sold it, and had it in the lot of his possession.
<br>All estimation shall be made according to the sicle of the sanctuary. A sicle hath twenty obols.
<br>The firstborn, which belong to the Lord, no man may sanctify and vow: whether it be bullock, or sheep, they are the Lord’s.
<br>And if it be an unclean beast, he that offer- eth it shall redeem it, according to thy estima- tion, and shall add the fifth part of the price. If he will not redeem it, it shall be sold to another for how much soever it was estimated by thee.
<br>Any thing that is devoted to the Lord, whether it be man, or beast, or field, shall not be sold: neither may it be redeemed. Whatsoever is once consecrated shall be holy of holies to the Lord.
<br>And any consecration that is offered by man, shall not be redeemed, but dying shall die. 30 All tithes of the land, whether of corn, or of the fruits of trees, are the Lord’s, and are sanc-
<br>tified to him.
<br>And if any man will redeem his tithes, he shall add the fifth part of them.
<br>Of all the tithes of oxen, and sheep, and goats, that pass under the shepherd’s rod, every tenth that cometh shall be sanctified to the Lord. 33 It shall not be chosen neither good nor bad, neither shall it be changed for another. If any
<br> 
<br>man change it: both that which was changed, and that for which it was changed, shall be sanc- tified to the Lord, and shall not be redeemed.
<br>34 These are the precepts which the Lord com- manded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai.

<br>Chapter 1
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses in the desert of Sinai in the tabernacle of the covenant, the first day of the second month, the second year of their going out of Egypt, saying:
<br>2	Take the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel by their families, and houses, and the names of every one, as many as are of the male sex,
<br>3	From twenty years old and upwards, of all the men of Israel fit for war, and you shall num- ber them by their troops, thou and Aaron.
<br>4	And there shall be with you the princes of the tribes, and of the houses in their kindreds,
<br>5	Whose names are these: Of Ruben, Elisur the son of Sedeur.
<br>6	Of Simeon, Salamiel the son of Surisaddai. 7 Of Juda, Nahasson the son of Aminadab. 8 Of Issachar, Nathanael the son of Suar.
<br>Of Zabulon, Eliab the son of Helon.
<br>And of the sons of Joseph: of Ephraim, Elisama the son of Ammiud: of Manasses, Gamaliel the son of Phadassur.
<br>Of Benjamin, Abidan the son of Gedeon. 12 Of Dan, Ahiezer the son of Ammisaddai. 13 Of Aser, Phegiel the son of Ochran.
<br>Of Gad, Eliasaph the son of Duel.
<br>Of Nephtali, Ahira the son of Enan.
<br>These are the most noble princes of the multitude by their tribes and kindreds, and the chiefs of the army of Israel:
<br> 
<br>
<br>Whom Moses and Aaron took with all the multitude of the common people:
<br>And assembled them on the first day of the second month, reckoning them up by the kin- dreds, and houses, and families, and heads, and names of every one from twenty years old and upward,
<br>As the Lord had commanded Moses. And they were numbered in the desert of Sinai.
<br>Of Ruben the eldest son of Israel, by their generations and families and houses and names of every head, all that were of the male sex, from twenty years old and upward, that were able to go forth to war,
<br>Were forty-six thousand five hundred.

<br>Of the sons of Gad, by their generations and families and houses of their kindreds were reckoned up by the names of every one from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war,

<br>Were reckoned up seventy-four thousand six hundred.

<br>Of the sons of Nephtali, by their genera- tions and families and houses of their kindreds, were reckoned up by the names of every one from twenty years old and upward, were able to go forth to war,

<br>These are they who were numbered by Moses and Aaron, and the twelve princes of Is- rael, every one by the houses of their kindreds.
<br>And the whole number of the children of Israel by their houses and families, from twenty years old and upward, that were able to go to war,
<br>Were six hundred and three thousand five hundred and fifty men.
<br>But the Levites in the tribes of their fami- lies were not numbered with them.
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>Number not the tribe of Levi, neither shalt thou put down the sum of them with the children of Israel:
<br>But appoint them over the tabernacle of the testimony, and all the vessels thereof, and whatsoever pertaineth to the ceremonies. They shall carry the tabernacle and all the furniture thereof: and they shall minister, and shall en- camp round about the tabernacle.
<br>When you are to go forward, the Levites shall take down the tabernacle: when you are to camp, they shall set it up. What stranger soever cometh to it, shall be slain.
<br>And the children of Israel shall camp every man by his troops and bands and army.
<br>But the Levites shall pitch their tents round about the tabernacle, lest there come in- dignation upon the multitude of the children of
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Israel, and they shall keep watch, and guard the tabernacle of the testimony.
<br>And the children of Israel did according to all things which the Lord had commanded Moses.
<br>
<br>Chapter 2
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying: 2 All the children of Israel shall camp by their troops, ensigns, and standards, and the houses of their kindreds, round about the tabernacle of
<br>the covenant.
<br>On the east Juda shall pitch his tents by the bands of his army: and the prince of his sons; shall be Nahasson the son of Aminadab.
<br>And the whole sum of the fighting men of his stock, were seventy-four thousand six hundred.
<br>Next unto him they of the tribe of Issachar encamped, whose prince was Nathanael, the son of Suar.
<br>And the whole number of his fighting men were fifty-four thousand four hundred.
<br>In the tribe of Zabulon the prince was Eliab the son of Helon.
<br>And all the army of fighting men of his stock, were fifty-seven thousand four hundred.
<br>All that were numbered in the camp of Juda, were a hundred and eighty-six thousand four hundred: and they by their troops shall march first.
<br>In the camp of the sons of Ruben, on the south side, the prince shall be Elisur the son of Sedeur:
<br>And the whole army of his fighting men, that were numbered, were forty-six thousand five hundred.
<br>Beside him camped they of the tribe of Simeon: whose prince was Salamiel the son of
<br> 
<br>Surisaddai.
<br>And the whole army of his fighting men, that were numbered, were fifty-nine thousand three hundred.
<br>In the tribe of Gad the prince was Eliasaph the son of Duel.
<br>And the whole army of his righting men that were numbered, were forty-five thousand six hundred and fifty.
<br>All that were reckoned up in the camp of Ruben, were a hundred and fifty-one thousand four hundred and fifty, by their troops: they shall march in the second place.
<br>And the tabernacle of the testimony shall be carried by the officers of the Levites and their troops. As it shall be set up, so shall it be taken down. Every one shall march according to their places, and ranks.
<br>On the west side shall be the camp of the sons of Ephraim, whose prince was Elisama the son of Ammiud.
<br>The whole army of his fighting men, that were numbered, were forty thousand five hun- dred.
<br>And with them the tribe of the sons of Manasses, whose prince was Gamaliel the son of Phadassur.
<br>And the whole army of his fighting men, that were numbered, were thirty-two thousand two hundred.
<br>In the tribe of the sons of Benjamin the prince was Abidan the son of Gedeon.
<br>And the whole army of fighting men, that were reckoned up, were thirty-five thousand four hundred.
<br>All that were numbered in the camp of Ephraim, were a hundred and eight-thousand one hundred by their troops: they shall march in the third place.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>On the north side camped the sons of Dan: whose prince was Ahiezar the son of Ammisad- dai.
<br>The whole army of his fighting men, that were numbered, were sixty-two thousand seven hundred.
<br>Beside him they of the tribe of Aser pitched their tents: whose prince was Phegiel the son of Ochran.
<br>The whole army of his fighting men, that were numbered, were forty-one thousand five hundred.
<br>Of the tribe of the sons of Nephtali the prince was Ahira the son of Enan.
<br>The whole army of his fighting men, were fifty-three thousand four hundred.
<br>All that were numbered in the camp of Dan, were a hundred and fifty-seven thousand six hundred: and they shall march last.
<br>This is the number of the children of Israel, of their army divided according to the houses of their kindreds and their troops, six hundred and three thousand five hundred and fifty.
<br>And the Levites were not numbered among the children of Israel: for so the Lord had com- manded Moses.
<br>And the children of Israel did according to all things that the Lord had commanded. They camped by their troops, and marched by the families and houses of their fathers.
<br>
<br>Chapter 3
<br>These are the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day that the Lord spoke to Moses in mount Sinai.
<br>And these the names of the sons of Aaron: his firstborn Nadab, then Abiu, and Eleazar, and Ithamar.
<br> 
<br>These the names of the sons of Aaron the priests that were anointed, and whose hands were filled and consecrated, to do the functions of priesthood.
<br>Now Nadab and Abiu died, without chil- dren, when they offered strange fire before the Lord, in the desert of Sinai: and Eleazar and Ithamar performed the priestly office in the pres- ence of Aaron their father.
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>Bring the tribe of Levi, and make them stand in the sight of Aaron the priest to min- ister to him, and let them watch,
<br>And observe whatsoever appertaineth to the service of the multitude before the tabernacle of the testimony,
<br>And let them keep the vessels of the taber- nacle, serving in the ministry thereof.
<br>And thou shalt give the Levites for a gift,
<br>To Aaron and to his sons, to whom they are delivered by the children of Israel. But thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons over the service of priesthood. The stranger that approacheth to minister, shall be put to death.
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>I have taken the Levites from the chil- dren of Israel, for every firstborn that openeth the womb among the children of Israel, and the Levites shall be mine.
<br>For every firstborn is mine: since I struck the firstborn in the land of Egypt: I have sanc- tified to myself whatsoever is firstborn in Israel both of man and beast, they are mine: I am the Lord.
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses in the desert of Sinai, saying:
<br>Number the sons of Levi by the houses of their fathers and their families, every male from one month and upward.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Moses numbered them as the Lord had commanded.
<br>And there were found sons of Levi by their names, Gerson and Caath Merari.
<br>The sons of Gerson: Lebni and Semei.
<br>The sons of Caath: Amram, and Jesaar, Hebron and Oziel:
<br>The sons of Merari, Moholi and Musi.
<br>Of Gerson were two families, the Lebnites, and the Semeites:
<br>Of which were numbered, people of the male sex from one month and upward, seven thousand five hundred.
<br>These shall pitch behind the tabernacle on the west,
<br>Under their prince Eliasaph the son of Lael.
<br>And their charge shall be in the tabernacle of the covenant:
<br>The tabernacle itself and the cover thereof, the hanging that is drawn before the doors of the tabernacle of the covenant, and the curtains of the court: the hanging also that is hanged in the entry of the court of the tabernacle, and whatso- ever belongeth to the rite of the altar, the cords of the tabernacle, and all the furniture thereof.
<br>Of the kindred of Caath come the fam- ilies of the Amramites and Jesaarites and He- bronites and Ozielites. These are the families of the Caathites reckoned up by their names:
<br>All of the male sex from one month and upward, eight thousand six hundred: they shall have the guard of the sanctuary,
<br>And shall camp on the south side.
<br>And their prince shall be Elisaphan the son of Oziel:
<br>And they shall keep the ark, and the table and the candlestick, the altars, and the vessels of the sanctuary, wherewith they minister, and the veil, and all the furniture of this kind.
<br> 
<br>And the prince of the princes of the Levites, Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, shall be over them that watch for the guard of the sanctuary. 33 And of Merari are the families of the Moho- lites, and Musites, reckoned up by their names: 34 All of the male kind from one month and
<br>upward, six thousand two hundred.
<br>Their prince Suriel the son of Abihaiel: their shall camp on the north side.
<br>Under their custody shall be the boards of the tabernacle, and the bars, and the pillars and their sockets, and all things that pertain to this kind of service:
<br>And the pillars of the court round about with their sockets, and the pins with their cords. 38 Before the tabernacle of the covenant, that
<br>is to say on the east side shall Moses and Aaron camp, with their sons, having the custody of the sanctuary, in the midst of the children of Israel. What stranger soever cometh unto it, shall be put to death.
<br>All the Levites, that I Moses and Aaron numbered according to the precept of the Lord, by their f families, of the male kind from one month and upward, were twenty-two thousand.
<br>And the Lord said to Moses: Number the firstborn of the male sex of the children of Israel, from one month and upward, and thou shalt take the sum of them.
<br>And thou shalt take the Levites to me for all the firstborn of the children of Israel, I am the Lord: and their cattle for all the firstborn of the cattle of the children of Israel:
<br>Moses reckoned up, as the Lord had com- manded, the firstborn of the children of Israel:
<br>And the males by their names, from one month and upward, were twenty-two thousand two hundred and seventy-three.
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Take the Levites for the firstborn of the children of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites for their cattle, and the Levites shall be mine. I am the Lord.
<br>But for the price of the two hundred and seventy-three, of the firstborn of the children of Israel, that exceed the number of the Levites,
<br>Thou shalt take five sicles for every bead, according to the weight of the sanctuary. A sicle hath twenty obols.
<br>And thou shalt give the money to Aaron and his sons, the price of them that are above.
<br>Moses therefore took the money of them that were above, and whom they had redeemed from the Levites,
<br>For the firstborn of the children of Israel, one thousand three hundred and sixty-five sicles, according to the weight of the sanctuary,
<br>And gave it to Aaron and his sons accord- ing to the word that the Lord had commanded him.
<br>
<br>Chapter 4
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, and Aaron, say- ing:
<br>Take the sum of the sons of Caath from the midst of the Levites, by their houses and fami- lies.
<br>From thirty years old and upward, to fifty years old, of all that go in to stand and to min- ister in the tabernacle of the covenant.
<br>This is the service of the sons of Caath:
<br>When the camp is; to set forward, Aaron and his sons shall go into the tabernacle of the covenant, and the holy of holies, and shall take down the veil that hangeth before the door, and shall wrap up the ark of the testimony in it,
<br>And shall cover it again with a cover of violet
<br> 
<br>skins, and shall spread over it a cloth all of violet, and shall put in the bars.
<br>They shall wrap up also the table of proposi- tion in a cloth of violet, and shall put with it the censers and little mortars, the cups and bowls to pour out the libations: the loaves shall be always on it:
<br>And they shall spread over it a cloth of scar- let, which again they shall cover with a covering of violet skins, and shall put in the bars.
<br>They shall take also a cloth of violet where- with they shall cover the candlestick with the lamps and tongs thereof and the snuffers and all the oil vessels, which are necessary for the dress- ing of the lamps:
<br>And over all they shall put a cover of violet skins and put in the bars.
<br>And they shall wrap up the golden altar also in a cloth of violet, and shall spread over it a cover of violet skins, and put in the bars.
<br>All the vessels wherewith they minister in the sanctuary, they shall wrap up in a cloth of violet, and shall spread over it a cover of violet skins, and put in the bars.
<br>They shall cleanse the altar also from the ashes, and shall wrap it up in a purple cloth,
<br>And shall put it with all the vessels that they use in the ministry thereof, that is to say, firepans, fleshhooks and forks, pothooks and shovels. They shall cover all the vessels of the altar together with a covering of violet skins, and shall put in the bars.
<br>And when Aaron and his sons have wrapped up the sanctuary and the vessels thereof at the removing of the camp, then shall the sons of Caath enter in to carry the things wrapped up: and they shall not touch the vessels of the sanctuary, lest they die. These are the burdens of the sons of Caath: in the tabernacle of the covenant:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>And over them shall be Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, to whose charge pertaineth the oil to dress the lamps, and the sweet incense, and the sacrifice, that is always offered, and the oil of unction, and whatsoever pertaineth to the service of the tabernacle, and of all the vessels that are in the sanctuary.
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:
<br>Destroy not the people of Caath from the midst of the Levites:
<br>But do this to them, that they may live, and not die, by touching the holies of holies. Aaron and his sons shall go in, and they shall appoint every man his work, and shall divide the burdens that every man is to carry.
<br>Let not others by any curiosity see the things that are in the sanctuary before they be wrapped up, otherwise they shall die.
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>Take the sum of the sons of Gerson also by their houses and families and kindreds.
<br>From thirty years old and upward, unto fifty years old. Number them all that go in and minister in the tabernacle of the covenant.
<br>This is the office of the family of the Ger- sonites:
<br>To carry the curtains of the tabernacle and the roof of the covenant, the other covering, and the violet covering over all, and the hanging that hangeth in the entry of the tabernacle of the covenant,
<br>The curtains of the court, and the veil in the entry that is before tabernacle. All things that pertain to the altar, the cords and the ves- sels of the ministry,
<br>The sons of Gerson shall carry, by the com- mandment of Aaron and his sons: and each man shall know to what burden he must be assigned.
<br> 
<br>This is the service of the family of the Ger- sonites in the tabernacle of the covenant, and they shall be under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.
<br>Thou shalt reckon up the sons of Merari also by the families and houses of their fathers, 30 From  thirty years old  and upward, unto fifty years old, all that go in to the office of their ministry, and to the service of the covenant of
<br>the testimony.
<br>These are their burdens: They shall carry the boards of the tabernacle and the bars thereof, the pillars and their sockets,
<br>The pillars also of the court round about, with their sockets and pins and cords. They shall receive by account all the vessels and furniture, and so shall carry them.
<br>This is the office of the family of the Mer- arites, and their ministry in the tabernacle of the covenant: and they shall be under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.
<br>So Moses and Aaron and the princes of the synagogue reckoned up the sons of Caath, by their kindreds and the houses of their fathers,
<br>From thirty years old and upward, unto fifty years old, all that go in to the ministry of the tabernacle of the covenant:
<br>And they were found two thousand seven hundred and fifty.
<br>This is the number of the people of Caath that go in to the tabernacle of the covenant: these did Moses and Aaron number according to the word of the Lord by the hand of Moses.
<br>The sons of Gerson also were numbered by the kindreds and houses of their fathers,
<br>From thirty years old and upward, unto fifty years old, all that go in to minister in the tabernacle of the covenant:
<br>And they were found two thousand six hun- dred and thirty.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>This is the people of the Gersonites, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the word of the Lord.
<br>The sons of Merari also were numbered by the kindreds and houses of their fathers,
<br>From thirty years old and upward, unto fifty years old, all that go in to fulfil the rites of the tabernacle of the covenant:
<br>And they were found three thousand two hundred.
<br>This is the number of the sons of Merari, whom Moses and Aaron reckoned up according to the commandment of the Lord by the hand of Moses.
<br>All that were reckoned up of the Levites, and whom Moses and Aaron and the princes of Israel took by name, by the kindreds and houses of their fathers,
<br>From thirty years old and upward, until fifty years old, that go into the ministry of the tabernacle, and to carry the burdens,
<br>Were in all eight thousand five hundred and eighty.
<br>Moses reckoned them up according to the word of the Lord, every one according to their office and burdens, as the Lord had commanded him.
<br>
<br>Chapter 5
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>Command the children of Israel, that they cast out of the camp every leper, and whosoever hath an issue of seed, or is defiled by the dead:
<br>Whether it be man or woman, cast ye them out of the camp, lest they defile it when I shall dwell with you,
<br>And the children of Israel did so, and they cast them forth without the camp, as the Lord
<br> 
<br>had spoken to Moses.
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>Say to the children of Israel: When a man or woman shall have committed any of all the sins that men are wont to commit, and by negligence shall have transgressed the commandment of the Lord, and offended,
<br>They shall confess their sin, and restore the principal itself, and the fifth part over and above, to him against whom they have sinned.
<br>But if there be no one to receive it, they shall give it to the Lord, and it shall be the priest’s, besides the ram that is offered for expiation, to be an atoning sacrifice.
<br>All the firstfruits also, which the children of Israel offer, belong to the priest:
<br>And whatsoever is offered into the sanctu- ary by every one, and is delivered into the hands of the priest, it shall be his.
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: The man whose wife shall have gone astray, and contemning her husband, 13 Shall have slept with another man, and her husband cannot discover it, but the adultery is secret, and cannot be proved by witnesses, be-
<br>cause she was not found in the adultery:
<br>If the spirit of jealousy stir up the hus- band against his wife, who either is defiled, or is charged with false suspicion,
<br>He shall bring her to the priest, and shall offer an oblation for her, the tenth part of a mea- sure of barley meal: he shall not pour oil thereon, nor put frankincense upon it: because it is a sac- rifice of jealousy, and an oblation searching out adultery.
<br>The priest therefore shall offer it, and set it before the Lord.
<br>And he shall take holy water in an earthen vessel, and he shall cast a little earth of the pave-
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>ment of the tabernacle into it.
<br>And when the woman shall stand before the Lord, he shall uncover her head, and shall put on her hands the sacrifice of remembrance, and the oblation of jealousy: and he himself shall hold the most bitter waters, whereon he hath heaped curses with execration.
<br>And he shall adjure her, and shall say: If another man hath not slept with thee, and if thou be not defiled by forsaking thy husband’s bed, these most bitter waters, on which I have heaped curses, shall not hurt thee.
<br>But if thou hast gone aside from thy hus- band, and art defiled, and hast lain with another man:
<br>These curses shall light upon thee: The Lord make thee a curse, and an example for all among his people: may he make thy thigh to rot, and may thy belly swell and burst asunder.
<br>Let the cursed waters enter into thy belly, and may thy womb swell and thy thigh rot. And the woman shall answer, Amen, amen.
<br>And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and shall wash them out with the most bitter waters, upon which he hath heaped the curses,
<br>And he shall give them her to drink. And when she hath drunk them up,
<br>The priest shall take from her hand the sacrifice of jealousy, and shall elevate it before the Lord, and shall put it upon the altar: yet so as first,
<br>To take a handful of the sacrifice of that which is offered, and burn it upon the altar: and so give the most bitter waters to the woman to drink.
<br>And when she hath drunk them, if she be defiled, and having despised her husband be guilty of adultery, the malediction shall go through her, and her belly swelling, her thigh
<br> 
<br>shall rot: and the woman shall be a curse, and an example to all the people.
<br>But if she be not defiled, she shall not be hurt, and shall bear children.
<br>This is the law of jealousy. If a woman hath gone aside from her husband, and be defiled,
<br>And the husband stirred up by the spirit of jealousy bring her before the Lord, and the priest do to her according to all things that are here written:
<br>The husband shall be blameless, and she shall bear her iniquity.
<br>
<br>Chapter 6
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: When a man, or woman, shall make a vow to be sanctified, and will consecrate themselves to the Lord:
<br>They shall abstain from wine, and from ev- ery thing that may make a man drunk. They shall not drink vinegar of wine, or of any other drink, nor any thing that is pressed out of the grape: nor shall they eat grapes either fresh or dried.
<br>All the days that they are consecrated to the Lord by vow: they shall eat nothing that cometh of the vineyard, from the raisin even to the kernel.
<br>All the time of his separation no razor shall pass over his head, until the day be fulfilled of his consecration to the Lord. He shall be holy, and shall let the hair of his head grow.
<br>All the time of his consecration he shall not go in to any dead,
<br>Neither shall he make himself unclean, even for his father, or for his mother, or for his brother, or for his sister, when they die, because
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>the consecration of his God is upon his head.
<br>All the days of his separation he shall be holy to the Lord.
<br>But if any man die suddenly before him: the head of his consecration shall be defiled: and he shall shave it forthwith on the same day of his purification, and again on the seventh day.
<br>And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons to the priest in the entry of the covenant of the testimony.
<br>And the priest shall offer one for sin, and the other for a holocaust, and shall pray for him, for that he hath sinned by the dead: and he shall sanctify his head that day:
<br>And shall consecrate to the Lord the days of his separation, offering a lamb of one year for sin: yet so that the former days be made void, because his sanctification was profaned.
<br>This is the law of consecration. When the days which he had determined by vow shall be expired, he shall bring him to the door of the tabernacle of the covenant,
<br>And shall offer his oblation to the Lord: one he lamb of a year old without blemish for a holocaust, and one ewe lamb of a year old with- out blemish for a sin offering, and one ram with- out blemish for a victim of peace offering,
<br>A basket also of unleavened bread, tem- pered with oil, and wafers without leaven anointed with oil, and the libations of each:
<br>And the priest shall present them before the Lord, and shall offer both the sin offering and the holocaust.
<br>But the ram he shall immolate for a sacri- fice of peace offering to the Lord, offering at the same time the basket of unleavened bread, and the libations that are due by custom.
<br>Then shall the hair of the consecration of the Nazarite, be shaved off before the door of the tabernacle of the covenant: and he shall take his
<br> 
<br>hair, and lay it upon the fire, which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings.
<br>And shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and he shall deliver them into the hands of the Nazarite, after his head is shaven.
<br>And receiving them again from him, he shall elevate them in the sight of the Lord: and they being sanctified shall belong to the priest, as the breast, which was commanded to be sepa- rated, and the shoulder. After this the Nazarite may drink wine.
<br>This is the law of the Nazarite, when he hath vowed his oblation to the Lord in the time of his consecration, besides those things which his hand shall find, according to that which he had vowed in his mind, so shall he do for the fulfilling of his sanctification.
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>Say to Aaron and his sons: Thus shall you bless the children of Israel, and you shall say to them:
<br>The Lord bless thee, and keep thee.
<br>The Lord shew his face to thee, and have mercy on thee.
<br>The Lord turn his countenance to thee, and give thee peace.
<br>And they shall invoke my name upon the children of Israel, and I will bless them.
<br>
<br>Chapter 7
<br>And it came to pass in the day that Moses had finished the tabernacle, and set it up, and had anointed and sanctified it with all its vessels, the altar likewise and all the vessels thereof,
<br>2 The princes of Israel and the heads of the families, in every tribe, who were the rulers of
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>them who had been numbered, offered
<br>3	Their gifts before the Lord, six wagons cov- ered, and twelve oxen. Two princes offered one wagon, and each one an ox, and they offered them before the tabernacle.
<br>4	And the Lord said to Moses:
<br>5	Receive them from them to serve in the min- istry of the tabernacle, and thou shalt deliver them to the Levites according to the order of their ministry.
<br>6	Moses therefore receiving the wagons and the oxen, delivered them to the Levites.

<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 8
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>2 Speak to Aaron, and thou shalt say to him: When thou shalt place the seven lamps, let the candlestick be set up on the south side. Give or- ders therefore that the lamps look over against the north, towards the table of the loaves of proposition, over against that part shall they give light, towards which the candlestick looketh. 3 And Aaron did so, and he put the lamps upon the candlestick, as the Lord had com-
<br>manded Moses.
<br>Now this was the work of the candlestick, it was of beaten gold, both the shaft in the mid- dle, and all that came out of both sides of the branches: according to the pattern which the Lord had shewn to Moses, so he made the can- dlestick.
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>Take the Levites out of the midst of the chil- dren of Israel, and thou shalt purify them,
<br>According to this rite: Let them be sprinkled with the water of purification, and let them shave all the hairs of their flesh. And when they shall have washed their garments, and are cleansed,
<br>They shall take an ox of the herd, and for the offering thereof fine flour tempered with oil: and thou shalt take another ox of the herd for a sin offering:
<br>And thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the covenant, calling together all the multitude of the children of Israel:
<br>And when the Levites are before the Lord, the children of Israel shall put their hands upon them:
<br>And Aaron shall offer the Levites, as a gift in the sight of the Lord from the children of Is- rael, that they may serve in his ministry.
<br>The Levites also shall put their hands upon
<br> 
<br>the heads of the oxen, of which thou shalt sacri- fice one for sin, and the other for a holocaust to the Lord, to pray for them.
<br>And thou shalt set the Levites in the sight of Aaron and of his, and shalt consecrate them being offered to the Lord,
<br>And shalt separate them from the midst of the children of Israel, to be mine.
<br>And afterwards they shall enter into the tabernacle of the covenant, to serve me. And thus shalt thou purify and consecrate them for an oblation of the Lord: for as a gift they were given me by the children of Israel.
<br>I have taken them instead of the firstborn that open every womb in Israel,
<br>For all the firstborn of the children of Israel, both of men and of beasts, are mine. From the day that I slew every firstborn in the land of Egypt, have I sanctified them to myself:
<br>And I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the children of Israel:
<br>And have delivered them for a gift to Aaron and his sons out of the midst of the people, to serve me for Israel in the tabernacle of the covenant, and to pray for them, lest there should be a plague among the people, if they should pre- sume to approach unto my sanctuary.
<br>And Moses and Aaron and all the multi- tude of the children of Israel did with the Levites all that the Lord had commanded Moses
<br>And they were purified, and washed their garments. And Aaron lifted them up in the sight of the Lord, and prayed for them,
<br>That being purified they might go into the tabernacle of the covenant to do their services before Aaron and his sons. As the Lord had commanded Moses touching the Levites, so was it done.
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>This is the law of the Levites: From twenty- five years old and upwards, they shall go in to minister in the tabernacle of the covenant.
<br>And when they shall have accomplished the fiftieth year of their age, they shall cease to serve:
<br>And they shall be the ministers of their brethren in the tabernacle of the covenant, to keep the things that are committed to their care, but not to do the works. Thus shalt thou order the Levites touching their charge.
<br>
<br>Chapter 9
<br>The Lord spoke to Moses in the desert of Sinai, the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, in the first month, saying:
<br>Let the children of Israel make the phase in its due time,
<br>The fourteenth day of this month in the evening, according to all the ceremonies and jus- tifications thereof.
<br>And Moses commanded the children of Israel that they should make the phase.
<br>And they made it in its proper time: the fourteenth day of the month at evening, in mount Sinai. The children of Israel did according to all things that the Lord had commanded Moses.
<br>But behold some who were unclean by occa- sion of the soul of a man, who could not make the phase on that day, coming to Moses and Aaron, 7 Said to them: We are unclean by occasion of the soul of a man. Why are we kept back that we may not offer in its season the offering to the
<br>Lord among the children of Israel?
<br>And Moses answered them: Stay that I may consult the Lord what he will ordain concerning you.
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br> 
<br>Say to the children of Israel: The man that shall be unclean by occasion of one that is dead, or shall be in a journey afar off in your nation, let him make the phase to the Lord.
<br>In the second month, on the fourteenth day of the month in the evening, they shall eat it with unleavened bread and wild lettuce:
<br>They shall not leave any thing thereof until morning, nor break a bone thereof, they shall observe all the ceremonies of the phase.
<br>But if any man is clean, and was not on a journey, and did not make the phase, that soul shall be cut off from among his people, because he offered not sacrifice to the Lord in due season: he shall bear his sin.
<br>The sojourner also and the stranger if they be among you, shall make the phase to the Lord according to the ceremonies and justifications thereof. The same ordinances shall be with you both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the land.
<br>Now on the day that the tabernacle was reared up, a cloud covered it. But from the evening there was over the tabernacle, as it were, the appearance of fire until the morning.
