Each outstanding certificate for voting or nonvoting common stock shall evidence ownership of the same number of shares of voting stock into which it is converted.

The authority of the Secretary of Education to approve the issuance of such obligations is limited to obligations issued by the Association and guaranteed by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection. Such obligations may be redeemable at the option of the Association before maturity in such manner as may be stipulated therein. The Secretary of the Treasury may not direct as a condition of his approval that any such issuance of obligations by the Association be made or sold to the Federal Financing Bank. To the extent that the average outstanding amount of the obligations owned by the Association pursuant to the authority contained in subsection (d)(1)(B) and (C) of this section and as to which the income is exempt from taxation under title 26 does not exceed the average stockholders' equity of the Association, the interest on obligations issued under this paragraph shall not be deemed to be interest on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry obligations for the purpose of section 265 of title 26.
<br>(2) Guarantee of debt
<br>
<br>The Secretary is authorized, prior to October 1, 1984, to guarantee payment when due of principal and interest on obligations issued by the Association in an aggregate amount determined by the Secretary in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury. Nothing in this section shall be construed so as to authorize the Secretary of Education or the Secretary of the Treasury to limit, control, or constrain programs of the Association or support of the Guaranteed Student Loan Program by the Association.
<br>(3) Borrowing authority to meet guarantee obligations
<br>
<br>To enable the Secretary to discharge his responsibilities under guarantees issued by him, he is authorized to issue to the Secretary of the Treasury notes or other obligations in such forms and denominations, bearing such maturities, and subject to such terms and conditions, as may be prescribed by the Secretary with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury. Such notes or other obligations shall bear interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturities during the months preceding the issuance of the notes or other obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to purchase any notes and other obligations issued hereunder and for that purpose he is authorized to use as a public debt transaction the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31, and the purposes for which securities may be issued under that chapter are extended to include any purchase of such notes and obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury may at any time sell any of the notes or other obligations acquired by him under this subsection. All redemptions, purchases, and sales by the Secretary of the Treasury of such notes or other obligations shall be treated as public debt transactions of the United States. There is authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary such sums as may be necessary to pay the principal and interest on the notes or obligations issued by him to the Secretary of the Treasury.
<br>(4) Action on request for guarantees
<br>
<br>Upon receipt of a request from the Association under this subsection requiring approvals by the Secretary of Education or the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Education or the Secretary of the Treasury shall act promptly either to grant approval or to advise the Association of the reasons for withholding approval. In no case shall such an approval be withheld for a period longer than 60 days unless, prior to the end of such period, the Secretary of Education and the Secretary of the Treasury submit to the Congress a detailed explanation of reasons for doing so.
<br>(5) Authority of Treasury to purchase debt
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to purchase any obligations issued by the Association pursuant to this subsection as now or hereafter in force, and for such purpose the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to use as a public debt transaction the proceeds of the sale of any securities hereafter issued under chapter 31 of title 31, as now or hereafter in force, and the purposes for which securities may be issued under chapter 31 of title 31, as now or hereafter in force are extended to include such purchases. The Secretary of the Treasury shall not at any time purchase any obligations under this subsection if such purchase would increase the aggregate principal amount of his then outstanding holdings of such obligations under this subsection to an amount greater than $1,000,000,000. Each purchase of obligations by the Secretary of the Treasury under this subsection shall be upon such terms and conditions as to yield a return at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average rate on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturities as of the last day of the month preceding the making of such purchase. The Secretary of the Treasury may, at any time, sell, upon such terms and conditions and at such price or prices as he shall determine, any of the obligations acquired by him under this subsection. All redemptions, purchases, and sales by the Secretary of the Treasury of such obligations under this subsection shall be treated as public debt transactions of the United States.
<br>(6) Sale of debt to Federal Financing Bank
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of law the Association is authorized to sell or issue obligations on the security of student loans, the payment of interest or principal of which has at any time been guaranteed under section 1078 or 1079 of this title, to the Federal Financing Bank.

<br>
<br>(B) If the Secretary determines that the Association has substantially failed to comply with subsection (q), subparagraph (A) shall be applied by substituting "1.0 percent" for "0.3 percent".

All stock and obligations issued by the Association pursuant to this section shall be deemed to be exempt securities within the meaning of laws administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission, to the same extent as securities which are direct obligations of, or obligations guaranteed as to principal or interest by, the United States. The Association shall, for the purposes of section 355(2) of title 12, be deemed to be an agency of the United States.

<br>§1087–3. Reorganization of Student Loan Marketing Association through formation of Holding Company
<br>(a) Actions by Association's Board of Directors
<br>
<br>The Board of Directors of the Association shall take or cause to be taken all such action as the Board of Directors deems necessary or appropriate to effect, upon the shareholder approval described in subsection (b), a restructuring of the common stock ownership of the Association, as set forth in a plan of reorganization adopted by the Board of Directors (the terms of which shall be consistent with this section) so that all of the outstanding common shares of the Association shall be directly owned by a Holding Company. Such actions may include, in the Board of Director's discretion, a merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of the Holding Company with and into the Association, which would have the effect provided in the plan of reorganization and the law of the jurisdiction in which such subsidiary is incorporated. As part of the restructuring, the Board of Directors may cause—
<br>
<br>(1) the common shares of the Association to be converted, on the reorganization effective date, to common shares of the Holding Company on a one for one basis, consistent with applicable State or District of Columbia law; and
<br>
<br>(2) Holding Company common shares to be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
<br>(b) Shareholder approval
<br>
<br>The plan of reorganization adopted by the Board of Directors pursuant to subsection (a) shall be submitted to common shareholders of the Association for their approval. The reorganization shall occur on the reorganization effective date, provided that the plan of reorganization has been approved by the affirmative votes, cast in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of the Association common stock.
<br>(c) Transition
<br>
<br>In the event the shareholders of the Association approve the plan of reorganization under subsection (b), the following provisions shall apply beginning on the reorganization effective date:
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Except as specifically provided in this section, until the dissolution date the Association shall continue to have all of the rights, privileges and obligations set forth in, and shall be subject to all of the limitations and restrictions of, section 1087–2 of this title, and the Association shall continue to carry out the purposes of such section. The Holding Company and any subsidiary of the Holding Company (other than the Association) shall not be entitled to any of the rights, privileges, and obligations, and shall not be subject to the limitations and restrictions, applicable to the Association under section 1087–2 of this title, except as specifically provided in this section. The Holding Company and any subsidiary of the Holding Company (other than the Association or a subsidiary of the Association) shall not purchase loans insured under this chapter until such time as the Association ceases acquiring such loans, except that the Holding Company may purchase such loans if the Association is merely continuing to acquire loans as a lender of last resort pursuant to section 1087–2(q) of this title or under an agreement with the Secretary described in paragraph (6).
<br>(2) Transfer of certain property
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in this section, on the reorganization effective date or as soon as practicable thereafter, the Association shall use the Association's best efforts to transfer to the Holding Company or any subsidiary of the Holding Company (or both), as directed by the Holding Company, all real and personal property of the Association (both tangible and intangible) other than the remaining property. Subject to the preceding sentence, such transferred property shall include all right, title, and interest in—
<br>
<br>(i) direct or indirect subsidiaries of the Association (excluding special purpose funding companies in existence on September 30, 1996, and any interest in any government-sponsored enterprise);
<br>
<br>(ii) contracts, leases, and other agreements of the Association;
<br>
<br>(iii) licenses and other intellectual property of the Association; and
<br>
<br>(iv) any other property of the Association.
<br>(B) Construction
<br>
<br>Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prohibit the Association from transferring remaining property from time to time to the Holding Company or any subsidiary of the Holding Company, subject to the provisions of paragraph (4).
<br>(3) Transfer of personnel
<br>
<br>On the reorganization effective date, employees of the Association shall become employees of the Holding Company (or any subsidiary of the Holding Company), and the Holding Company (or any subsidiary of the Holding Company) shall provide all necessary and appropriate management and operational support (including loan servicing) to the Association, as requested by the Association. The Association, however, may obtain such management and operational support from persons or entities not associated with the Holding Company.
<br>(4) Dividends
<br>
<br>The Association may pay dividends in the form of cash or noncash distributions so long as at the time of the declaration of such dividends, after giving effect to the payment of such dividends as of the date of such declaration by the Board of Directors of the Association, the Association's capital would be in compliance with the capital standards and requirements set forth in section 1087–2(r) of this title. If, at any time after the reorganization effective date, the Association fails to comply with such capital standards, the Holding Company shall transfer with due diligence to the Association additional capital in such amounts as are necessary to ensure that the Association again complies with the capital standards.
<br>(5) Certification prior to dividend
<br>
<br>Prior to the payment of any dividend under paragraph (4), the Association shall certify to the Secretary of the Treasury that the payment of the dividend will be made in compliance with paragraph (4) and shall provide copies of all calculations needed to make such certification.

<br>
<br>(ii) contractual commitments for future warehousing advances, or pursuant to letters of credit or standby bond purchase agreements, which are outstanding as of the reorganization effective date;
<br>
<br>(iii) the Association serving as a lender-of-last-resort pursuant to section 1087–2(q) of this title; and
<br>
<br>(iv) the Association's purchase of loans insured under this part, if the Secretary, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, enters into an agreement with the Association for the continuation or resumption of the Association's secondary market purchase program because the Secretary determines there is inadequate liquidity for loans made under this part.
<br>(B) Agreement
<br>
<br>The Secretary is authorized to enter into an agreement described in clause (iv) of subparagraph (A) with the Association covering such secondary market activities. Any agreement entered into under such clause shall cover a period of 12 months, but may be renewed if the Secretary determines that liquidity remains inadequate. The fee provided under section 1087–2(h)(7) of this title shall not apply to loans acquired under any such agreement with the Secretary.
<br>(7) Issuance of debt obligations during the transition period; attributes of debt obligations
<br>
<br>After the reorganization effective date, the Association shall not issue debt obligations which mature later than September 30, 2008, except in connection with serving as a lender-of-last-resort pursuant to section 1087–2(q) of this title or with purchasing loans under an agreement with the Secretary as described in paragraph (6). Nothing in this section shall modify the attributes accorded the debt obligations of the Association by section 1087–2 of this title, regardless of whether such debt obligations are incurred prior to, or at any time following, the reorganization effective date or are transferred to a trust in accordance with subsection (d).

<br>
<br>(i) the financial risk to the Association resulting from the activities of any associated person, to the extent such activities are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition of the Association, including the Association's capital ratio, the Association's liquidity, or the Association's ability to conduct and finance the Association's operations; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the Association's policies, procedures, and systems for monitoring and controlling any such financial risk.
<br>(B) Summary reports
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Treasury may require summary reports of the information described in subparagraph (A) to be filed no more frequently than quarterly. If, as a result of adverse market conditions or based on reports provided pursuant to this subparagraph or other available information, the Secretary of the Treasury has concerns regarding the financial or operational condition of the Association, the Secretary of the Treasury may, notwithstanding the preceding sentence and subparagraph (A), require the Association to make reports concerning the activities of any associated person whose business activities are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial or operational condition of the Association.
<br>(C) Separate operation of corporations
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>The funds and assets of the Association shall at all times be maintained separately from the funds and assets of the Holding Company or any subsidiary of the Holding Company and may be used by the Association solely to carry out the Association's purposes and to fulfill the Association's obligations.

<br>(D) Encumbrance of assets
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any Federal or State law, rule, or regulation, or legal or equitable principle, doctrine, or theory to the contrary, under no circumstances shall the assets of the Association be available or used to pay claims or debts of or incurred by the Holding Company.

<br>Codification
<br>
<br>Section was formerly classified to section 2751 of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare, prior to transfer to this section. See note below.
<br>
<br>Section was originally enacted as section 121 (and later renumbered section 141) of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, Pub. L. 88–452, at which time it was classified to section 2751 of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare. It was renumbered as section 441 of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, Pub. L. 89–329, by Pub. L. 90–575, §131(a), (b)(1), and later editorially transferred to this section to merge with the rest of the Act, which is classified to this chapter.

<br>Prior Provisions
<br>
<br>A prior section 441 of Pub. L. 89–329, title IV, formerly Pub. L. 88–452, title I, §141, formerly §121, Aug. 20, 1964, 78 Stat. 513; Pub. L. 89–329, title IV, §441(2), Nov. 8, 1965, 79 Stat. 1249; renumbered §141, Pub. L. 90–222, title I, §111(a), Dec. 23, 1967, 81 Stat. 726; renumbered Pub. L. 89–329, title IV, §441, and amended Pub. L. 90–575, title I, §§131(a), (b)(1), 132, 133(a), Oct. 16, 1968, 82 Stat. 1028, 1029; Pub. L. 91–95, §5, Oct. 22, 1969, 83 Stat. 143; Pub. L. 92–318, title I, §§135, 135A(a), June 23, 1972, 86 Stat. 270; Pub. L. 94–482, title I, §128(a), Oct. 12, 1976, 90 Stat. 2143; Pub. L. 96–374, title IV, §431, Oct. 3, 1980, 94 Stat. 1433, stated purpose of this part and authorized appropriations for fiscal years 1981 to 1985, prior to the general revision of this part by Pub.

<br>
<br>Another prior section 441 of Pub. L. 89–329, title IV, Nov. 8, 1965, 79 Stat. 1249, which amended this section and former sections 2752 to 2756 and 2761 of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare, was repealed by Pub. L. 90–575, title I, §131(a), Oct. 16, 1968, 82 Stat. 1028. Because the repeal happened in order to accommodate the new section 441 resulting from the renumbering of former section 141 of Pub.

<br>
<br>(1) From the amount appropriated pursuant to section 1087–51(b) of this title for each fiscal year, the Secretary shall first allocate to each eligible institution for each succeeding fiscal year, an amount equal to 100 percent of the amount such institution received under subsections (a) and (b) of this section for fiscal year 1999 (as such subsections were in effect with respect to allocations for such fiscal year).
<br>
<br>(2)(A) From the amount so appropriated, the Secretary shall next allocate to each eligible institution that began participation in the program under this part after fiscal year 1999 but is not a first or second time participant, an amount equal to the greater of—
<br>
<br>(i) $5,000; or
<br>
<br>(ii) 90 percent of the amount received and used under this part for the first year it participated in the program.
<br>
<br>(B) From the amount so appropriated, the Secretary shall next allocate to each eligible institution that began participation in the program under this part after fiscal year 1999 and is a first or second time participant, an amount equal to the greatest of—
<br>
<br>(i) $5,000;
<br>
<br>(ii) an amount equal to (I) 90 percent of the amount received and used under this part in the second preceding fiscal year by eligible institutions offering comparable programs of instruction, divided by (II) the number of students enrolled at such comparable institutions in such fiscal year, multiplied by (III) the number of students enrolled at the applicant institution in such fiscal year; or
<br>
<br>(iii) 90 percent of the institution's allocation under this part for the preceding fiscal year.
<br>
<br>(C) Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph, the Secretary shall allocate to each eligible institution which—
<br>
<br>(i) was a first-time participant in the program in fiscal year 2000 or any subsequent fiscal year, and
<br>
<br>(ii) received a larger amount under this subsection in the second year of participation,
<br>
<br>an amount equal to 90 percent of the amount it received under this subsection in its second year of participation.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) If the amount appropriated for any fiscal year is less than the amount required to be allocated to all institutions under paragraph (1) of this subsection, then the amount of the allocation to each such institution shall be ratably reduced.
<br>
<br>(B) If the amount appropriated for any fiscal year is more than the amount required to be allocated to all institutions under paragraph (1) but less than the amount required to be allocated to all institutions under paragraph (2), then—
<br>
<br>(i) the Secretary shall allot the amount required to be allocated to all institutions under paragraph (1), and
<br>
<br>(ii) the amount of the allocation to each institution under paragraph (2) shall be ratably reduced.

<br>
<br>(4)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Secretary may allocate an amount equal to not more than 10 percent of the amount by which the amount appropriated in any fiscal year to carry out this part exceeds $700,000,000 among eligible institutions described in subparagraph (B).

<br>
<br>(1) From the remainder of the amount appropriated pursuant to section 1087–51(b) of this title after making the allocations required by subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall allocate to each eligible institution which has an excess eligible amount an amount which bears the same ratio to such remainder as such excess eligible amount bears to the sum of the excess eligible amounts of all such eligible institutions (having such excess eligible amounts).
<br>
<br>(2) For any eligible institution, the excess eligible amount is the amount, if any, by which—
<br>
<br>(A)(i) the amount of that institution's need (as determined under subsection (c) of this section), divided by (ii) the sum of the need of all institutions (as so determined), multiplied by (iii) the amount appropriated pursuant to section 1087–51(b) of this title for the fiscal year; exceeds
<br>
<br>(B) the amount required to be allocated to that institution under subsection (a) of this section.
<br>(c) Determination of institution's need
<br>
<br>(1) The amount of an institution's need is equal to the sum of the self-help need of the institution's eligible undergraduate students and the self-help need of the institution's eligible graduate and professional students.

<br>
<br>(ii) the average cost of attendance for all undergraduate students minus the expected family contribution determined under subparagraph (B) for that income category, except that the amount computed by such subtraction shall not be less than zero;
<br>
<br>(E) add the amounts determined under subparagraph (D) for each income category of dependent students; and
<br>
<br>(F) multiply the number of eligible independent students in each income category by the lesser of—

<br>(i) 25 percent of the average cost of attendance for all undergraduate students determined under subparagraph (C); or
<br>
<br>(ii) the average cost of attendance for all undergraduate students minus the expected family contribution determined under subparagraph (B) for that income category, except that the amount computed by such subtraction for any income category shall not be less than zero;

<br>
<br>(C) determine the average cost of attendance for all graduate and professional students;
<br>

<br>
<br>(E) multiply the amounts determined under subparagraph (D) by the number of eligible students in each category; and
<br>
<br>(F) add the amounts determined under subparagraph (E) of this paragraph for each income category.
<br>
<br>(4)(A) For purposes of paragraphs (2) and (3), the term "average cost of attendance" means the average of the attendance costs for undergraduate students and for graduate and professional students, which shall include (i) tuition and fees determined in accordance with subparagraph (B), (ii) standard living expenses determined in accordance with subparagraph (C), and (iii) books and supplies determined in accordance with subparagraph (D).

<br>
<br>(D) The allowance for books and supplies described in subparagraph (A)(iii) is equal to $600.
<br>(d) Reallocation of excess allocations
<br>
