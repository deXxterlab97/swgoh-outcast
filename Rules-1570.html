<br>
<br>"(F) October 1: Yosemite National Park established in California.
<br>
<br>"(3) Theodore Roosevelt was this nation's 26th President and is considered by many to be our 'Conservationist President'.
<br>
<br>"(4) As a frequent visitor to the West, Theodore Roosevelt witnessed the virtual destruction of some big game species and the overgrazing that destroyed the grasslands and with them the habitats for small mammals and songbirds and conservation increasingly became one of his major concerns.
<br>
<br>"(5) When he became President in 1901, Roosevelt pursued this interest in conservation by establishing the first 51 Bird Reserves, 4 Game Preserves, and 150 National Forests.
<br>
<br>"(6) He also established the United States Forest Service, signed into law the creation of 5 National Parks, and signed the Act for the Preservation of American Antiquities in 1906 under which he proclaimed 18 national monuments.
<br>
<br>"(7) Approximately 230,000,000 acres of area within the United States was placed under public protection by Theodore Roosevelt.
<br>
<br>"(8) Theodore Roosevelt said that nothing short of defending this country in wartime 'compares in importance with the great central task of leaving this land even a better land for our descendants than it is for us'.
<br>
<br>"(9) The National Park Service was created by an Act signed by President Woodrow Wilson on August 25, 1916.
<br>
<br>"(10) The National Park System comprises 391 areas covering more than 84,000,000 acres in every State (except Delaware), the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.
<br>
<br>"(11) The sites or areas within the National Park System vary widely in size and type from vast natural wilderness to birthplaces of Presidents to world heritage archaeology sites to an African burial ground memorial in Manhattan and include national parks, monuments, battlefields, military parks, historical parks, historic sites, lakeshores, seashores, recreation areas, scenic rivers and trails, and the White House.
<br>
<br>"(12) In addition to the sites within the National Park System, the United States has placed numerous other types of sites under various forms of conservancy, such as the national forests and sites within the National Wildlife Refuge System and on the National Register of Historic Places."

<br>
<br>"(a) In General.—In order to remove barriers to circulation, the Secretary of the Treasury shall carry out an aggressive, cost-effective, continuing campaign to encourage commercial enterprises to accept and dispense $1 coins that have as designs on the obverse the so-called 'Sacagawea design'.
<br>
<br>"(b) Report.—The Secretary of the Treasury shall submit to Congress an annual report on the success of the efforts described in subsection (a)."
<br>5-Cent Coins Minted in 2004 and 2005
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 109–230, §8, June 15, 2006, 120 Stat. 393, provided that: "Notwithstanding the fifth sentence of section 5112(d)(1) of title 31, United States Code, the Secretary of the Treasury may continue to issue, after December 31, 2005, numismatic items that contain 5-cent coins minted in the years 2004 and 2005."
<br>Presidential Commemorative Dollar Coins; Findings
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 109–145, title I, §101, Dec. 22, 2005, 119 Stat. 2664, provided that: "Congress finds the following:
<br>
<br>"(1) There are sectors of the United States economy, including public transportation, parking meters, vending machines, and low-dollar value transactions, in which the use of a $1 coin is both useful and desirable for keeping costs and prices down.
<br>
<br>"(2) For a variety of reasons, the new $1 coin introduced in 2000 has not been widely sought-after by the public, leading to higher costs for merchants and thus higher prices for consumers.
<br>
<br>"(3) The success of the 50 States Commemorative Coin Program (31 U.S.C. 5112(l)) for circulating quarter dollars shows that a design on a United States circulating coin that is regularly changed in a manner similar to the systematic change in designs in such Program radically increases demand for the coin, rapidly pulling it through the economy.
<br>
<br>"(4) The 50 States Commemorative Coin Program also has been an educational tool, teaching both Americans and visitors something about each State for which a quarter has been issued.
<br>
<br>"(5) A national survey and study by the Government Accountability Office has indicated that many Americans who do not seek, or who reject, the new $1 coin for use in commerce would actively seek the coin if an attractive, educational rotating design were to be struck on the coin.
<br>
<br>"(6) The President is the leader of our tripartite government and the President's spouse has often set the social tone for the White House while spearheading and highlighting important issues for the country.
<br>
<br>"(7) Sacagawea, as currently represented on the new $1 coin, is an important symbol of American history.
<br>
<br>"(8) Many people cannot name all of the Presidents, and fewer can name the spouses, nor can many people accurately place each President in the proper time period of American history.
<br>
<br>"(9) First Spouses have not generally been recognized on American coinage.
<br>
<br>"(10) In order to revitalize the design of United States coinage and return circulating coinage to its position as not only a necessary means of exchange in commerce, but also as an object of aesthetic beauty in its own right, it is appropriate to move many of the mottos and emblems, the inscription of the year, and the so-called 'mint marks' that currently appear on the 2 faces of each circulating coin to the edge of the coin, which would allow larger and more dramatic artwork on the coins reminiscent of the so-called 'Golden Age of Coinage' in the United States, at the beginning of the Twentieth Century, initiated by President Theodore Roosevelt, with the assistance of noted sculptors and medallic artists James Earle Fraser and Augustus Saint-Gaudens.
<br>
<br>"(11) Placing inscriptions on the edge of coins, known as edge-incusing, is a hallmark of modern coinage and is common in large-volume production of coinage elsewhere in the world, such as the 2,700,000,000 2-Euro coins in circulation, but it has not been done on a large scale in United States coinage in recent years.
<br>
<br>"(12) Although the Congress has authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to issue gold coins with a purity of 99.99 percent, the Secretary has not done so.
<br>
<br>"(13) Bullion coins are a valuable tool for the investor and, in some cases, an important aspect of coin collecting."
<br>Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial 1-cent Coin Redesign
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 109–145, title III, Dec. 22, 2005, 119 Stat. 2673, provided that:
<br>"SEC. 301. FINDINGS.
<br>
<br>"Congress finds the following:
<br>
<br>"(1) Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President, was one of the Nation's greatest leaders, demonstrating true courage during the Civil War, one of the greatest crises in the Nation's history.
<br>
<br>"(2) Born of humble roots in Hardin County (present-day LaRue County), Kentucky, on February 12, 1809, Abraham Lincoln rose to the Presidency through a combination of honesty, integrity, intelligence, and commitment to the United States.
<br>
<br>"(3) With the belief that all men are created equal, Abraham Lincoln led the effort to free all slaves in the United States.
<br>
<br>"(4) Abraham Lincoln had a generous heart, with malice toward none, and with charity for all.
<br>
<br>"(5) Abraham Lincoln gave the ultimate sacrifice for the country he loved, dying from an assassin's bullet on April 15, 1865.
<br>
<br>"(6) All Americans could benefit from studying the life of Abraham Lincoln, for Lincoln's life is a model for accomplishing the 'American dream' through honesty, integrity, loyalty, and a lifetime of education.
<br>
<br>"(7) The year 2009 will be the bicentennial anniversary of the birth of Abraham Lincoln.
<br>
<br>"(8) Abraham Lincoln was born in Kentucky, grew to adulthood in Indiana, achieved fame in Illinois, and led the nation in Washington, D.C.
<br>
<br>"(9) The so-called 'Lincoln cent' was introduced in 1909 on the 100th anniversary of Lincoln's birth, making the obverse design the most enduring on the nation's coinage.
<br>
<br>"(10) President Theodore Roosevelt was so impressed by the talent of Victor David Brenner that the sculptor was chosen to design the likeness of President Lincoln for the coin, adapting a design from a plaque Brenner had prepared earlier.
<br>
<br>"(11) In the nearly 100 years of production of the 'Lincoln cent', there have been only 2 designs on the reverse: the original, featuring 2 wheat-heads in memorial style enclosing mottoes, and the current representation of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.
<br>
<br>"(12) On the occasion of the bicentennial of President Lincoln's birth and the 100th anniversary of the production of the Lincoln cent, it is entirely fitting to issue a series of 1-cent coins with designs on the reverse that are emblematic of the 4 major periods of President Lincoln's life.
<br>"SEC. 302. REDESIGN OF LINCOLN CENT FOR 2009.
<br>
<br>"(a) In General.—During the year 2009, the Secretary of the Treasury shall issue 1-cent coins in accordance with the following design specifications:
<br>
<br>"(1) Obverse.—The obverse of the 1-cent coin shall continue to bear the Victor David Brenner likeness of President Abraham Lincoln.
<br>
<br>"(2) Reverse.—The reverse of the coins shall bear 4 different designs each representing a different aspect of the life of Abraham Lincoln, such as—
<br>
<br>"(A) his birth and early childhood in Kentucky;
<br>
<br>"(B) his formative years in Indiana;
<br>
<br>"(C) his professional life in Illinois; and
<br>
<br>"(D) his presidency, in Washington, D.C.
<br>
<br>"(b) Issuance of Redesigned Lincoln Cents in 2009.—
<br>
<br>"(1) Order.—The 1-cent coins to which this section applies shall be issued with 1 of the 4 designs referred to in subsection (a)(2) beginning at the start of each calendar quarter of 2009.
<br>
<br>"(2) Number.—The Secretary shall prescribe, on the basis of such factors as the Secretary determines to be appropriate, the number of 1-cent coins that shall be issued with each of the designs selected for each calendar quarter of 2009.
<br>
<br>"(c) Design Selection.—The designs for the coins specified in this section shall be chosen by the Secretary—
<br>
<br>"(1) after consultation with the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts; and
<br>
<br>"(2) after review by the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee.
<br>"SEC. 303. REDESIGN OF REVERSE OF 1-CENT COINS AFTER 2009.
<br>
<br>"The design on the reverse of the 1-cent coins issued after December 31, 2009, shall bear an image emblematic of President Lincoln's preservation of the United States of America as a single and united country.
<br>"SEC. 304. NUMISMATIC PENNIES WITH THE SAME METALLIC CONTENT AS THE 1909 PENNY.
<br>
<br>"The Secretary of the Treasury shall issue 1-cent coins in 2009 with the exact metallic content as the 1-cent coin contained in 1909 in such number as the Secretary determines to be appropriate for numismatic purposes.
<br>"SEC. 305. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.
<br>
<br>"It is the sense of the Congress that the original Victor David Brenner design for the 1-cent coin was a dramatic departure from previous American coinage that should be reproduced, using the original form and relief of the likeness of Abraham Lincoln, on the 1-cent coins issued in 2009."
<br>Designs on the 5-Cent Coin
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 108–15, title I, §101, Apr. 23, 2003, 117 Stat. 615, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(a) In General.—Subject to subsection (b) and after consulting with the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee and the Commission of Fine Arts, the Secretary of the Treasury may change the design on the obverse and the reverse of the 5-cent coin for coins issued in 2003, 2004, and 2005 in recognition of the bicentennial of the Louisiana Purchase and the expedition of Meriwether Lewis and William Clark.
<br>
<br>"(b) Design Specifications.—
<br>
<br>"(1) Obverse.—If the Secretary of the Treasury elects to change the obverse of 5-cent coins issued during 2003, 2004, and 2005, the design shall depict a likeness of President Thomas Jefferson, different from the likeness that appeared on the obverse of the 5-cent coins issued during 2002, in recognition of his role with respect to the Louisiana Purchase and the commissioning of the Lewis and Clark expedition.
<br>
<br>"(2) Reverse.—If the Secretary of the Treasury elects to change the reverse of the 5-cent coins issued during 2003, 2004, and 2005, the design selected shall depict images that are emblematic of the Louisiana Purchase or the expedition of Meriwether Lewis and William Clark.
<br>
<br>"(3) Other inscriptions.—5-cent coins issued during 2003, 2004, and 2005 shall continue to meet all other requirements for inscriptions and designations applicable to circulating coins under section 5112(d)(1) of title 31, United States Code."

<br>"(1) it is appropriate and timely—
<br>
<br>"(A) to honor the unique Federal republic of 50 States that comprise the United States; and
<br>
<br>"(B) to promote the diffusion of knowledge among the youth of the United States about the individual States, their history and geography, and the rich diversity of the national heritage;
<br>
<br>"(2) the circulating coinage of the United States has not been modernized during the 25-year period preceding the date of enactment of this Act [Dec. 1, 1997];
<br>
<br>"(3) a circulating commemorative 25-cent coin program could produce earnings of $110,000,000 from the sale of silver proof coins and sets over the 10-year period of issuance, and would produce indirect earnings of an estimated $2,600,000,000 to $5,100,000,000 to the United States Treasury, money that will replace borrowing to fund the national debt to at least that extent; and
<br>
<br>"(4) it is appropriate to launch a commemorative circulating coin program that encourages young people and their families to collect memorable tokens of all of the States for the face value of the coins."
<br>Dollar Coins
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 105–124, §4(e), (f), Dec. 1, 1997, 111 Stat. 2536, 2537, provided that:

<br>"(a) Study.—The Secretary of the Treasury shall by June 1, 1997 complete a study of the feasibility of a circulating commemorative coin program to commemorate each of the 50 States. The study shall assess likely public acceptance of and consumer demand for different coins that might be issued in connection with such a program (taking into consideration the pace of issuance of coins and the length of such a program), a comparison of the costs of producing coins issued under the program and the revenue that the program would generate, the impact on coin distribution systems, the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches to selecting designs for coins in such a program, and such other factors as the Secretary considers appropriate in deciding upon the feasibility of such a program. No steps taken in order to gather information for this study shall be considered a collection of information within the meaning of section 3502 of title 44, United States Code.
<br>
<br>"(b) Report.—The Secretary shall submit the study required in subsection (a) above, to the Committee on Banking and Financial Services of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs of the Senate, simultaneously on its receipt by the Secretary.
<br>
<br>"(c) 50-State Commemorative Coin Program.—The Secretary shall determine by August 1, 1997 whether the results of the study authorized by subsection (a) justify such a program. If the Secretary determines that such a program is justified, then he shall by January 1, 1999, notwithstanding the fourth sentence of subsection (d)(1) and subsection (d)(2) of section 5112, title 31, United States Code, commence a commemorative coin program consisting of the minting and issuance of quarter dollar coins bearing designs, selected in accordance with paragraph (4) of this subsection, which are emblematic of the 50 States.

<br>
<br>"(2) Order of issuance.—Each State will be honored by a coin in the order of that State's admission to the United States.
<br>
<br>"(3) Number of coins.—Of the quarter dollar coins issued during each year of the program, the Secretary shall prescribe, on the basis of such factors as the Secretary determines to be appropriate, the number of quarter dollar coins which shall be issued with each of the designs selected for such year.
<br>
<br>"(4) Selection of design.—Each of the 50 designs required for quarter dollars issued under the program shall be—
<br>
<br>"(A) selected pursuant to a process, decided upon by the Secretary, on the basis of the study conducted pursuant to subsection (a), which process shall involve, among other things, consultation with appropriate officials of the State being commemorated with such design; and

<br>"(B) reviewed by the Citizens Commemorative Coin Advisory Committee and the Commission of Fine Arts.
<br>
<br>"(5) Treatment as numismatic items.—For purposes of sections 5134 and 5136 of title 31, United States Code, all coins minted under this section shall be considered to be numismatic items.

<br>
<br>"(A) Quality of coins.—The Secretary may mint and issue such number of quarter dollars of each design selected under paragraph (4) of this subsection in uncirculated and proof qualities as the Secretary determines to be appropriate.
<br>
<br>"(B) Silver coins.—Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 5112(b) of title 31, United States Code, the Secretary may mint and issue such number of quarter dollars of each design selected under paragraph (4) of this subsection as the Secretary determines to be appropriate with a content of 90 percent silver and 10 percent copper.
<br>
<br>"(C) Sources of bullion.—The Secretary may obtain silver for minting coins under paragraph (6)(B) from stockpiles established under the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act [50 U.S.C. 98 et seq.].

<br>§5113. Tolerances and testing of coins
<br>
<br>(a) The Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe reasonable manufacturing tolerances for specifications in section 5112 of this title (except for specifications that are limits) for the dollar, half dollar, quarter dollar, and dime coins. The weight of the 5-cent coin may vary not more than 0.194 gram. The weight of the one-cent coin may vary not more than 0.13 gram. Any gold coin issued under section 5112 of this title shall contain the full weight of gold stated on the coin.
<br>
<br>(b) The Secretary shall keep a record of the kind, number, and weight of each group of coins minted and test a number of the coins separately to determine if the coins conform to the weight specified in section 5112(a) of this title. If the coins tested do not conform, the Secretary—
<br>
<br>(1) shall weigh each coin of the group separately and deface the coins that do not conform and cast them into bars for reminting; or
<br>
<br>(2) may remelt the group of coins.

<br>
<br>In subsection (a), the words "for the dollar, half dollar, quarter dollar, and dime coins" are added because of the restatement. The words "0.194 gram" are substituted for "three grains", and the words "0.13 gram" are substituted for "two grains", for consistency in the revised chapter.
<br>
<br>In subsection (b), before clause (1), the words "Secretary shall keep a record of the kind, number, and weight of each group of coins minted" are substituted for 31:351(1st sentence) because of the source provisions restated in section 321(c) of the revised title. In clause (1), the words "deface the coins that do not conform and cast them into bars for reminting" are substituted for "shall be defaced and delivered to the superintendent of melting and refining department as standard bullion, to be again formed into ingots and recoined" for consistency in the revised chapter and to eliminate unnecessary words. In clause (2), the words "if more convenient" are omitted as surplus.

<br>§5114. Engraving and printing currency and security documents
<br>
<br>(a) Authority To Engrave and Print.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—The Secretary of the Treasury shall engrave and print United States currency and bonds of the United States Government and currency and bonds of United States territories and possessions from intaglio plates on plate printing presses the Secretary selects. However, other security documents and checks may be printed by any process the Secretary selects. Engraving and printing shall be carried out within the Department of the Treasury if the Secretary decides the engraving and printing can be carried out as cheaply, perfectly, and safely as outside the Department.
<br>
<br>(2) Engraving and printing for other governments.—The Secretary of the Treasury may produce currency, postage stamps, and other security documents for foreign governments if—
<br>
<br>(A) the Secretary of the Treasury determines that such production will not interfere with engraving and printing needs of the United States; and
<br>
<br>(B) the Secretary of State determines that such production would be consistent with the foreign policy of the United States.
<br>
<br>(3) Procurement guidelines.—Articles, material, and supplies procured for use in the production of currency, postage stamps, and other security documents for foreign governments pursuant to paragraph (2) shall be treated in the same manner as articles, material, and supplies procured for public use within the United States for purposes of title III of the Act of March 3, 1933 (41 U.S.C. 10a et seq.; commonly referred to as the Buy American Act).1
<br>
<br>(b) United States currency has the inscription "In God We Trust" in a place the Secretary decides is appropriate. Only the portrait of a deceased individual may appear on United States currency and securities. The name of the individual shall be inscribed below the portrait.
<br>
<br>(c) The Secretary may make a contract to manufacture distinctive paper for United States currency and securities. To promote competition among manufacturers of the distinctive paper, the Secretary may split the award for the manufacture of the paper between the 2 bidders with the lowest prices a pound. When the Secretary decides that it is necessary to operate more than one mill to manufacture distinctive paper, the Secretary may—
<br>
<br>(1) employ individuals temporarily at rates of pay equivalent to the rates of pay of regular employees; and
<br>
<br>(2) charge the pay of the temporary employees to the appropriation available for manufacturing distinctive paper.

<br>
<br>In subsection (a), the words "The Secretary of the Treasury shall engrave and print" are substituted for "The work of engraving and printing . . . shall be performed at the Treasury Department" in 31:415 because of the source provisions restated in section 321(c) of the revised title. The words "United States currency and security documents of the United States Government and currency and bonds of the United States territories and possessions" are substituted for "the backs and tints of all United States bonds, the backs and tints of all United States paper money, and the backs and tints of bonds and paper money issued by any of the insular possessions of the United States" in 31:177 to eliminate unnecessary words and for clarity and consistency in the revised title. The words "other security documents and checks" are substituted for "checks" because only currency and bonds must be printed from intaglio plates. The text of 31:177(1st proviso) is omitted as unnecessary because of the authority of the Secretary to engrave and print restated in the subsection and the source provisions restated in section 303 of the revised title. The text of 31:177(last proviso) is omitted as executed. The text of the first and 2d provisos in the 4th paragraph under the heading "Engraving and Printing" in section 1 of the Act of August 24, 1912 (ch. 355, 37 Stat. 430), is omitted as superseded by 31:177(1st proviso). The words after the semicolon in the 2d paragraph under the heading "Bureau of Engraving and Printing" of the Act of January 3, 1923 (ch. 22, 42 Stat. 1099), are omitted as executed. The words "if the Secretary decides the engraving and printing can be carried out . . . as outside the Department" are substituted for "provided it can be done there" in 31:415 for clarity. The words "The Secretary of the Treasury may purchase and provide all the machinery and materials" in 31:416 are omitted as being superseded by section 5142 of the revised title. The words "and employ such persons and appoint such officers as are necessary for the purpose of section 415 of this title" are omitted as unnecessary because of 5:3101. The text of section 3577(words before the semicolon) of the Revised Statutes is omitted as superseded by 31:415.
<br>
<br>In subsection (b), the words "United States currency has the inscription" are substituted for "the dies shall bear . . . the inscription" in 31:324a for clarity. The words "At such time as new dies for the printing of currency are adopted" are omitted as executed. The words "and thereafter this inscription shall appear on all United States currency and coins" are omitted as unnecessary because of the restatement of the source provisions in this subsection and section 5112(d) of the revised title. The words "in connection with the current program of the Treasury Department to increase the capacity of presses utilized by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing" in the Act of July 11, 1955 (ch. 303, 69 Stat. 290), are omitted as unnecessary. The words "Only . . . of a deceased individual" are substituted for "No . . . while the original of such portrait is living" in 31:413 for clarity. The words "United States currency and obligations" are substituted for "bonds, securities, notes, fractional or postal currency of the United States" for consistency in the revised title. The words "shall be placed upon any of the plates for bonds, securities, notes, and silver certificates of the United States" in 31:414 are omitted as unnecessary because of the restatement.
<br>
<br>In subsection (c), before clause (1), the words "subject to applicable regulations under the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended" in 31:418 are omitted as unnecessary. The words "On and after August 11, 1951" in 31:418a are omitted as executed. The words "received after advertisement" are omitted as unnecessary because of 41:252. The words "the Secretary decides" are added for clarity. In clause (1), the words "as may be necessary" in 31:419 are omitted as surplus. In clause (2), the word "pay" is substituted for "compensation" for consistency in the revised subsection and with other titles of the United States Code.

<br>§5116. Buying and selling gold and silver
<br>
<br>(a)(1) With the approval of the President, the Secretary of the Treasury may—
<br>
<br>(A) buy and sell gold in the way, in amounts, at rates, and on conditions the Secretary considers most advantageous to the public interest; and
<br>
<br>(B) buy the gold with any direct obligations of the United States Government or United States coins and currency authorized by law, or with amounts in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated.
<br>
<br>(2) Amounts received from the purchase of gold are an asset of the general fund of the Treasury. Amounts received from the sale of gold shall be deposited by the Secretary in the general fund of the Treasury and shall be used for the sole purpose of reducing the national debt.
<br>
<br>(3) The Secretary shall acquire gold for the coins issued under section 5112(i) of this title by purchase of gold mined from natural deposits in the United States, or in a territory or possession of the United States, within one year after the month in which the ore from which it is derived was mined. The Secretary shall pay not more than the average world price for the gold. In the absence of available supplies of such gold at the average world price, the Secretary may use gold from reserves held by the United States to mint the coins issued under section 5112(i) of this title. The Secretary shall issue such regulations as may be necessary to carry out this paragraph.
<br>
<br>(b)(1) The Secretary may buy silver mined from natural deposits in the United States, or in a territory or possession of the United States, that is brought to a United States mint or assay office within one year after the month in which the ore from which it is derived was mined. The Secretary may use the coinage metal fund under section 5111(b) of this title to buy silver under this subsection.
<br>
<br>(2) The Secretary may sell or use Government silver to mint coins, except silver transferred to stockpiles established under the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act (50 U.S.C. 98 et seq.). The Secretary shall obtain the silver for the coins authorized under section 5112(e) of this title by purchase from stockpiles established under the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act (50 U.S.C. 98 et seq.). At such time as the silver stockpile is depleted, the Secretary shall obtain silver as described in paragraph (1) to mint coins authorized under section 5112(e). If it is not economically feasible to obtain such silver, the Secretary may obtain silver for coins authorized under section 5112(e) from other available sources. The Secretary shall not pay more than the average world price for silver under any circumstances. As used in this paragraph, the term "average world price" means the price determined by a widely recognized commodity exchange at the time the silver is obtained by the Secretary. The Secretary shall sell silver under conditions the Secretary considers appropriate for at least $1.292929292 a fine troy ounce.

The words "after July 23, 1965" in 31:394 are omitted as executed. The words "to procure bullion for coinage" and 31:335(2d–last sentences) are omitted as obsolete because the Secretary of the Treasury has authority to mint coins containing silver only under section 5112(e) of the revised title and the Secretary holds sufficient silver to mint those coins. See Sen. Rept. No. 91–1084 (1970).
<br>
<br>In subsection (b)(2), the word "terms" is omitted as being included in "conditions". The words "for at least" are substituted for "at a price not less than the monetary value of" to eliminate unnecessary words.

<br>(a) The Secretary of the Treasury shall—
<br>

<br>
<br>(2) as required, assay coins, metal, and bullion;

When practicable, the Secretary shall weigh the bullion in front of the depositor. The Secretary shall give the depositor a receipt for the bullion stating the description and weight of the bullion. When the Secretary has to melt the bullion or remove base metals before the value of the bullion can be determined, the weight is the weight after the melting or removal of the metals. The Secretary may refuse a deposit of gold bullion if the deposit is less than $100 in value or the bullion is so base that it is unsuitable for the operations of the Bureau of the Mint.
<br>
<br>(c) When the gold and silver are combined in bullion that is deposited and either the gold or silver is so little that it cannot be separated economically, the Secretary may not pay the depositor for the gold or silver that cannot be separated.
<br>
<br>(d)(1) Under conditions prescribed by the Secretary, a person may exchange unrefined bullion for fine bars when—
<br>
<br>(A) gold and silver are combined in the bullion in proportions that cannot be economically refined; or
<br>
<br>(B) necessary supplies of acids cannot be procured at reasonable rates.
<br>
<br>(2) The charge for refining in an exchange under this subsection may be not more than the charge imposed in an exchange of unrefined bullion for refined bullion.
<br>
<br>(e) The Secretary shall prepare bars for payment of deposits. The Secretary shall stamp each bar with a designation of the weight and fineness of the bar and a symbol the Secretary considers suitable to prevent fraudulent imitation of the bar.

<br>§5122. Payment to depositors
<br>
<br>(a) The Secretary of the Treasury shall determine the fineness, weight, and value of each deposit and bar under section 5121 of this title. The value and the amount of charges under subsection (b) of this section shall be based on the fineness and weight of the bullion. The Secretary shall give the depositor a statement of the charges and the net amount of the deposit to be paid in money or bars of the same species of bullion as that deposited.
<br>
<br>(b) The Secretary shall impose a charge equal to the average cost of material, labor, waste, and use of machinery of a United States mint or assay office for—
<br>
<br>(1) melting and refining bullion;
<br>
<br>(2) using copper as an alloy when bullion deposited is above standard;
<br>
<br>(3) separating gold and silver combined in the bullion; and
<br>
<br>(4) preparing bars.
<br>
<br>(c) The Secretary shall pay to the depositor or to a person designated by the depositor money or bars equivalent to the bullion deposited as soon as practicable after the value of the deposit is determined. If demanded, the Secretary shall pay depositors in the order in which the bullion is deposited with the Secretary. However, when there is an unavoidable delay in determining the value of a deposit, the Secretary shall pay subsequent depositors. When practicable and convenient, the Secretary shall pay depositors in the denominations requested by the depositor. After the depositor is paid, the bullion is the property of the United States Government.
<br>
<br>(d) To allow the Secretary to pay depositors with as little delay as possible, the Secretary shall keep in the mints and assay offices, when possible, money and bullion the Secretary decides are convenient and necessary.
