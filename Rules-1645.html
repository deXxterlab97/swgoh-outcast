<br>
<br>(A) collected before, during, or after such storm; and
<br>
<br>(B) necessary to determine magnitude and timing of wind speeds, rainfall, the barometric pressure, river flows, the extent, height, and timing of storm surge, topographic and bathymetric data, and other measures required to accurately model and assess damage from such storm.

<br>(7) Named Storm Event Model
<br>
<br>The term "Named Storm Event Model" means the official meteorological and oceanographic computerized model, developed by the Administrator under subsection (b)(1)(A), which utilizes covered data to replicate the magnitude, timing, and spatial variations of winds, rainfall, and storm surges associated with named storms for which post-storm assessments are conducted.

<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>Upon identification of a named storm under subparagraph (A), and pursuant to the protocol established under subsection (c), the Administrator may deploy sensors to enhance the collection of covered data in the areas in coastal States that the Administrator determines are at the highest risk of experiencing geophysical events that would cause indeterminate losses.
<br>(ii) Rule of construction
<br>
<br>If the Administrator takes action under clause (i), that action may not be construed as indicating that a post-storm assessment will be developed for any coastal State in which that action is taken.
<br>(C) Identification of indeterminate losses in coastal States
<br>
<br>Not later than 30 days after the first date on which sustained winds of not less than 39 miles per hour are measured in a coastal State during a named storm identified under subparagraph (A), the Secretary of Homeland Security shall notify the Administrator with respect to the existence of any indeterminate losses in that coastal State resulting from that named storm.
<br>(D) Post-storm assessment required
<br>
<br>Upon confirmation of indeterminate losses identified under subparagraph (C) with respect to a named storm, the Administrator shall develop a post-storm assessment for each coastal State that suffered such indeterminate losses as a result of the named storm using the Named Storm Event Model and covered data collected for such named storm pursuant to the protocol established under subsection (c)(1).

<br>
<br>The Administrator shall ensure, to the greatest extent practicable, that each post-storm assessment developed under paragraph (2) has a degree of accuracy of not less than 90 percent.
<br>(4) Certification
<br>
<br>For each post-storm assessment carried out under paragraph (2), the Administrator shall—
<br>
<br>(A) certify the degree of accuracy for such assessment, including specific reference to any segments or geographic areas for which the assessment is less than 90 percent accurate; and
<br>
<br>(B) report such certification to the Secretary of Homeland Security for the purposes of use with indeterminate loss claims under section 4057 of title 42.
<br>(5) Finality of determinations
<br>
<br>A certification of the degree of accuracy of a post-storm assessment under this subsection by the Administrator shall be final and shall not be subject to judicial review.

<br>(2) Acquisition of sensors and structures
<br>
<br>If the Administrator is unable to use a public or private asset to obtain covered data as part of the protocol established under paragraph (1), the Administrator may acquire such sensors and structures for the placement of sensors as may, in the discretion of the Administrator, be necessary to obtain such data.
<br>(3) Use of Federal assets
<br>
<br>If the protocol requires placement of a sensor to develop assessments pursuant to subsection (b), the Administrator shall, to the extent practicable, use Federal assets for the placement of such sensors.
<br>(4) Use of acquired structures
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>If the Administrator acquires a structure for the placement of a sensor for purposes of such protocol, the Administrator shall to the extent practical permit other public and private entities to place sensors on such structure to collect—
