<br>Findings
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 106–25, §2, Apr. 29, 1999, 113 Stat. 41, provided that: "Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>"(1) States differ substantially in demographics, in school governance, and in school finance and funding. The administrative and funding mechanisms that help schools in one State improve may not prove successful in other States.
<br>
<br>"(2) Although the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 [20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.] and other Federal education statutes afford flexibility to State educational agencies and local educational agencies in implementing Federal programs, certain requirements of Federal education statutes or regulations may impede local efforts to reform and improve education.
<br>
<br>"(3) By granting waivers of certain statutory and regulatory requirements, the Federal Government can remove impediments for local educational agencies in implementing educational reforms and raising the achievement levels of all children.
<br>
<br>"(4) State educational agencies are closer to local school systems, implement statewide educational reforms with both Federal and State funds, and are responsible for maintaining accountability for local activities consistent with State standards and assessment systems. Therefore, State educational agencies are often in the best position to align waivers of Federal and State requirements with State and local initiatives.
<br>
<br>"(5) The Education Flexibility Partnership Demonstration Act [former 20 U.S.C. 5891(e)] allows State educational agencies the flexibility to waive certain Federal requirements, along with related State requirements, but allows only 12 States to qualify for such waivers.
<br>
<br>"(6) Expansion of waiver authority will allow for the waiver of statutory and regulatory requirements that impede implementation of State and local educational improvement plans, or that unnecessarily burden program administration, while maintaining the intent and purposes of affected programs, such as the important focus on improving mathematics and science performance under title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 [20 U.S.C. 6601 et seq.] (Dwight D. Eisenhower Professional Development Program), and maintaining such fundamental requirements as those relating to civil rights, educational equity, and accountability.
<br>
<br>"(7) To achieve the State goals for the education of children in the State, the focus must be on results in raising the achievement of all students, not process."
<br>§5891b. Educational flexibility program

<br>
<br>(I) the eligibility of the State as described in paragraph (2);

<br>
<br>(ii) the performance of the local educational agency, educational service agency, or school with respect to meeting the accountability requirement described in paragraph (2)(C) and the goals described in subparagraph (A)(iii) has been inadequate to justify continuation of such waiver;

<br>(ii) Termination of authority
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall terminate the authority of a State educational agency to grant waivers of Federal statutory or regulatory requirements as described in paragraph (1)(A) if the Secretary determines, after providing the State educational agency with notice and an opportunity for a hearing, that such agency's performance has been inadequate to justify continuation of such authority based on such agency's performance against the specific long-term goals and measurements of interim progress established under section 1111(c)(4)(A)(i) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965.
<br>(C) Renewal
<br>(i) In general

<br>SUBCHAPTER IX—EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH AND IMPROVEMENT
<br>§6001. Short title
<br>
<br>This subchapter may be cited as the "Educational Research, Development, Dissemination, and Improvement Act of 1994".
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 103–227, title IX, §901, Mar. 31, 1994, 108 Stat. 212.)
<br>References in Text
<br>
<br>This subchapter, referred to in text, was in the original "this title", meaning title IX of Pub. L. 103–227, Mar. 31, 1994, 108 Stat. 212, which enacted this subchapter, amended sections 2422, 3155, 3412, 3419, 3462, and 4085b of this title, repealed section 1221e of this title, and enacted provisions set out as notes under sections 1221e and 3155 of this title.
<br>§6002. Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds as follows with respect to improving education in the United States:
<br>
<br>(1) A majority of public schools in the United States are failing to prepare students to achieve the National Education Goals. The Federal Government should support an extensive program of educational research, development, dissemination, replication and assistance to identify and support the best responses for the challenges ahead. A significant investment in attaining a deeper understanding of the processes of learning and schooling and developing new ideas holds the best hope of making a substantial difference to the lives of every student in the United States. The Office of Educational Research and Improvement within the Department of Education should be at the center of this campaign in order to coordinate such efforts.
<br>
<br>(2) The Federal role in educational research has been closely identified with youths who are socioeconomically disadvantaged, are minorities, belong to a language minority, or have a disability. The Federal commitment to education was sufficient to serve not more than—
<br>
<br>(A) in 1993, 1 out of every 6 low-income children in need of preschool education;
<br>
<br>(B) in 1990, 3 out of every 5 children in need of remediation;
<br>
<br>(C) in 1991, 1 out of every 5 children in need of bilingual education; and
<br>
<br>(D) in 1992, 1 out of every 20 youths eligible for assistance under the Job Training Partnership Act.
<br>
<br>(3) The failure of the Federal Government to adequately invest in educational research and development has denied the United States a sound foundation of knowledge on which to design school improvements. The educational achievement of minority children is of particular concern because at least half of the public school students in 25 of the largest cities of the United States are minority children, and demographers project that, by the year 2005, almost all urban public school students will be minority children or other children in poverty.
