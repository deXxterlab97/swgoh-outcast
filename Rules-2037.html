<br>§1636. Alaska land bank
<br>(a) Establishment; agreements
<br>
<br>(1) In order to enhance the quantity and quality of Alaska's renewable resources and to facilitate the coordinated management and protection of Federal, State, and Native and other private lands, there is hereby established the Alaska Land Bank Program. Any private landowner is authorized as provided in this section to enter into a written agreement with the Secretary if his lands adjoin, or his use of such lands would directly affect, Federal land, Federal and State land, or State land if the State is not participating in the program. Any private landowner described in subsection (d)(1) whose lands do not adjoin, or whose use of such lands would not directly affect either Federal or State lands also is entitled to enter into an agreement with the Secretary. Any private landowner whose lands adjoin, or whose use of such lands would directly affect, only State, or State and private lands, is authorized as provided in this section to enter into an agreement with the State of Alaska if the State is participating in the program. If the Secretary is the contracting party with the private landowner, he shall afford the State an opportunity to participate in negotiations and become a party to the agreement. An agreement may include all or part of the lands of any private landowner: Provided, That no lands shall be included in the agreement unless the Secretary, or the State, determines that the purposes of the program will be promoted by their inclusion.
<br>
<br>(2) If a private landowner consents to the inclusion in an agreement of the stipulations provided in subsections (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(4), (b)(5), and (b)(7), and if such owner does not insist on any additional terms which are unacceptable to the Secretary or the State, as appropriate, the owner shall be entitled to enter into an agreement pursuant to this section. If an agreement is not executed within one hundred and twenty days of the date on which a private landowner communicates in writing his consent to the stipulations referred to in the preceding sentence, the appropriate Secretary or State agency head shall execute an agreement. Upon such execution, the private owner shall receive the benefits provided in subsection (c) hereof.
<br>
<br>(3) No agreement under this section shall be construed as affecting any land, or any right or interest in land, of any owner not a party to such agreement.
<br>(b) Terms of agreement
<br>
<br>Each agreement referred to in subsection (a) shall have an initial term of ten years, with provisions, if any, for renewal for additional periods of five years. Such agreement shall contain the following terms:
<br>
<br>(1) The landowner shall not alienate, transfer, assign, mortgage, or pledge the lands subject to the agreement except as provided in section 14(c) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1613(c)], or permit development or improvement on such lands except as provided in the agreement. For the purposes of this section only, each agreement entered into with a landowner described in subsection (d)(1) shall constitute a restriction against alienation imposed by the United States upon the lands subject to the agreement.
<br>
<br>(2) Lands subject to the agreement shall be managed by the owner in a manner compatible with the management plan, if any, for the adjoining Federal or State lands, and with the requirements of this subsection. If lands subject to the agreement do not adjoin either Federal or State lands, they shall be managed in a manner compatible with the management plan, if any, of Federal or State lands which would be directly affected by the use of such private lands. If no such plan has been adopted, or if the use of such private lands would not directly affect either Federal or State lands, the owner shall manage such lands in accordance with the provisions in paragraph (1) of this subsection. Except as provided in (3) 1 of this subsection, nothing in this section or the management plan of any Federal or State agency shall be construed to require a private landowner to grant public access on or across his lands.
<br>
<br>(3) If the surface landowner so consents, such lands may be made available for local or other recreational use: Provided, That the refusal of a private landowner to permit the uses referred to in this subsection shall not be grounds for the refusal of the Secretary or the State to enter into an agreement with the landowner under this section.
<br>
<br>(4) Appropriate Federal and/or State agency heads shall have reasonable access to such privately owned land for purposes relating to the administration of the adjoining Federal or State lands, and to carry out their obligations under the agreement.
<br>
<br>(5) Reasonable access to such land by officers of the State shall be permitted for purposes of conserving fish and wildlife.
<br>
<br>(6) Those services or other consideration which the appropriate Secretary or the State shall provide to the owner pursuant to subsection (c)(1) shall be set forth.
<br>
<br>(7) All or part of the lands subject to the agreement may be withdrawn from the Alaska land bank program not earlier than ninety days after the landowner—
<br>
<br>(A) submits written notice thereof to the other parties which are signatory to the agreement; and
<br>
<br>(B) pays all Federal, State and local property taxes and assessments which, during the particular term then in effect, would have been incurred except for the agreement, together with interest on such taxes and assessments in an amount to be determined at the highest rate of interest charged with respect to delinquent property taxes by the Federal, State or local taxing authority, if any.
<br>
<br>(8) The agreement may contain such additional terms, which are consistent with the provisions of this section, as seem desirable to the parties entering into the agreement: Provided, That the refusal of the landowner to agree to any additional terms shall not be grounds for the refusal of the Secretary or the State to enter into an agreement with the landowner under this section.
<br>(c) Benefits to private landowners
<br>
<br>(1) In addition to any requirement of applicable law, the appropriate Secretary is authorized to provide technical and other assistance with respect to fire control, trespass control, resource and land use planning, and the protection, maintenance, and enhancement of any special values of the land subject to the agreement, all with or without reimbursement as agreed upon by the parties, so long as the landowner is in compliance with the agreement.
<br>
<br>(2) The provision of section 21(e) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1620(e)] shall apply to all lands which are subject to an agreement made pursuant to this section so long as the parties to the agreement are in compliance therewith.
<br>(d) Automatic protections for lands conveyed pursuant to Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act
<br>
<br>(1)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of law or doctrine of equity, all land and interests in land in Alaska conveyed by the Federal Government pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.] to a Native individual or Native Corporation or subsequently reconveyed by a Native Corporation pursuant to section 39 of that Act [43 U.S.C. 1629e] to a Settlement Trust or conveyed to a Native Corporation pursuant to an exchange authorized by section 22(f) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1621(f)] or section 3192(h) of title 16 or other applicable law shall be exempt, so long as such land and interests are not developed or leased or sold to third parties from—
<br>
<br>(i) adverse possession and similar claims based upon estoppel;
<br>
<br>(ii) real property taxes by any governmental entity;
<br>
<br>(iii) judgments resulting from a claim based upon or arising under—
<br>
<br>(I) title 11 or any successor statute,
<br>
<br>(II) other insolvency or moratorium laws, or
<br>
<br>(III) other laws generally affecting creditors' rights;
<br>
<br>(iv) judgments in any action at law or in equity to recover sums owed or penalties incurred by a Native Corporation or Settlement Trust or any employee, officer, director, or shareholder of such corporation or trust, unless this exemption is contractually waived prior to the commencement of such action; and
<br>
<br>(v) involuntary distributions or conveyances related to the involuntary dissolution of a Native Corporation or Settlement Trust.
<br>
<br>(B) Except as otherwise provided 2 specifically provided, the exemptions described in subparagraph (A) shall apply to any claim or judgment existing on or arising after February 3, 1988.
<br>
<br>(2) Definitions.—(A) For purposes of this subsection, the term—
<br>
<br>(i) "Developed" means a purposeful modification of land, or an interest in land, from its original state that effectuates a condition of gainful and productive present use without further substantial modification. Any such modification shall be performed by the Native individual or Native Corporation. Surveying, construction of roads, providing utilities, or other similar actions, which are normally considered to be component parts of the development process but do not create the condition described in the preceding sentence, shall not constitute a developed state within the meaning of this clause. In order to terminate the exemptions listed in paragraph (1), land, or an interest in land, must be developed for purposes other than exploration, and the exemptions will be terminated only with respect to the smallest practicable tract actually used in the developed state. Any lands previously developed by third-party trespassers shall not be considered to have been developed.; 3
<br>
<br>(ii) "Exploration" means the examination and investigation of undeveloped land to determine the existence of subsurface nonrenewable resources; and
<br>
<br>(iii) "Leased" means subjected to a grant of primary possession entered into for a gainful purpose with a determinable fee remaining in the hands of the grantor. With respect to a lease that conveys rights of exploration and development, the exemptions listed in paragraph (1) shall continue with respect to that portion of the leased tract that is used solely for the purposes of exploration.
<br>
<br>(B) For purposes of this subsection—
<br>
<br>(i) land shall not be considered developed solely as a result of—
<br>
<br>(I) the construction, installation, or placement upon such land of any structure, fixture, device, or other improvement intended to enable, assist, or otherwise further subsistence uses or other customary or traditional uses of such land, or
<br>
<br>(II) the receipt of fees related to hunting, fishing, and guiding activities conducted on such land;
<br>
<br>(ii) land upon which timber resources are being harvested shall be considered developed only during the period of such harvest and only to the extent that such land is integrally related to the timber harvesting operation;
<br>
<br>(iii) land subdivided by a State or local platting authority on the basis of a subdivision plat submitted by the holder of the land or its agent, shall be considered developed on the date an approved subdivision plat is recorded by such holder or agent unless the subdivided property is a remainder parcel; and
<br>
<br>(iv) lands or interest in lands shall not be considered developed or leased or sold to a third party as a result of an exchange or conveyance of such land or interest in land between or among Native Corporations and trusts, partnerships, corporations, or joint ventures, whose beneficiaries, partners, shareholders, or joint venturers are Native Corporations.
<br>
<br>(3) Action by a Trustee.—(A) Except as provided in this paragraph and in section 14(c)(3) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1613(c)(3)] no trustee, receiver, or custodian vested pursuant to applicable Federal or State law with a right, title, or interest of a Native individual or Native Corporation shall—
<br>
<br>(i) assign or lease to a third party,
<br>
<br>(ii) commence development or use of, or
<br>
<br>(iii) convey to a third party,
<br>
<br>any right, title, or interest in any land, or interests in land, subject to the exemptions described in paragraph (1).
<br>
<br>(B) The prohibitions of subparagraph (A) shall not apply—
<br>
<br>(i) when the actions of such trustee, receiver, or custodian are for purposes of exploration or pursuant to a judgment in law or in equity (or arbitration award) arising out of any claim made pursuant to section 7(i) or section 14(c) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1606(i) or 1613(c)];
<br>
<br>(ii) to any land, or interest in land, which has been—
<br>
<br>(I) developed or leased prior to the vesting of the trustee, receiver, or custodian with the right, title, or interest of the Native Corporation; or
<br>
<br>(II) expressly pledged as security for any loan or expressly committed to any commercial transaction in a valid agreement; or
<br>
<br>(iii) to actions by any trustee whose right, title, or interest in land or interests in land arises pursuant to an agreement between or among Native Corporations and trusts, partnerships, or joint ventures whose beneficiaries, partners, shareholders, or joint venturers are Native Corporations.
<br>
<br>(4) Exclusions, Reattachment of Exemptions.—(A) The exemptions listed in paragraph (1) shall not apply to any land, or interest in land, which is—
<br>
<br>(i) developed or leased or sold to a third party;
<br>
<br>(ii) held by a Native Corporation in which neither—
<br>
<br>(I) the Settlement Common Stock of the corporation,
<br>
<br>(II) the Settlement Common Stock of the corporation and other stock of the corporation held by holders of Settlement Common Stock, nor
<br>
<br>(III) the Settlement Common Stock of the corporation and other stock of the corporation held by holders of Settlement Common Stock and by Natives and descendants of Natives,
<br>
<br>represents a majority of either the total equity of the corporation or the total voting power of the corporation for the purposes of electing directors; or
<br>
<br>(iii) held by a Settlement Trust with respect to which any of the conditions set forth in section 39 of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1629e] have been violated.
<br>
<br>(B) The exemptions described in clauses (iii), (iv), and (v) of paragraph (1)(A) shall not apply to any land, or interest in land—
<br>
<br>(i) to the extent that such land or interest is expressly pledged as security for any loan or expressly committed to any commercial transaction in a valid agreement, and
<br>
<br>(ii) to the extent necessary to enforce a judgment in any action at law or in equity (or any arbitration award) arising out of any claim made pursuant to section 7(i) or section 14(c) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1606(i) or 1613(c)].
<br>
<br>(C) If the exemptions listed in paragraph (1) are terminated with respect to land, or an interest in land, as a result of development (or a lease to a third party), and such land, or interest in land, subsequently reverts to an undeveloped state (or the third-party lease is terminated), then the exemptions shall again apply to such land, or interest in land, in accordance with the provisions of this subsection.
<br>
<br>(5) Tax Recapture Upon Subdivision Plat Recordation.—(A) Upon the recordation with an appropriate government authority of an approved subdivision plat submitted by, or on behalf of, a Native individual, Native Corporation, or Settlement Trust with respect to land described in paragraph (1), such individual, corporation, or trust shall pay in accordance with this paragraph all State and local property taxes on the smallest practicable tract integrally related to the subdivision project that would have been incurred by the individual, corporation, or trust on such land (excluding the value of subsurface resources and timber) in the absence of the exemption described in paragraph (1)(A)(ii) during the thirty months prior to the date of the recordation of the plat.
<br>
<br>(B) State and local property taxes specified in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph (together with interest at the rate of 5 per centum per annum commencing on the date of recordation of the subdivision plat) shall be paid in equal semi-annual installments over a two-year period commencing on the date six months after the date of recordation of the subdivision plat.
<br>
<br>(C) At least thirty days prior to final approval of a plat of the type described in subparagraph (A), the government entity with jurisdiction over the plat shall notify the submitting individual, corporation, or trust of the estimated tax liability that would be incurred as a result of the recordation of the plat at the time of final approval.
<br>
<br>(6) Savings.—(A) No provision of this subsection shall be construed to impair, or otherwise affect, any valid contract or other obligation that was entered into prior to February 3, 1988.
<br>
<br>(B) Enactment of this subsection shall not affect any real property tax claim in litigation on February 3, 1988.
<br>(e) Condemnation
<br>
<br>All land subject to an agreement made pursuant to subsection (a) and all land, and interests in land, conveyed or subsequently reconveyed pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.] to a Native individual, Native Corporation, or Settlement Trust shall be subject to condemnation for public purposes in accordance with the provisions of this Act and other applicable law.
<br>(f) Existing contracts
<br>
<br>Nothing in this section shall be construed as impairing, or otherwise affecting in any manner, any contract or other obligation which was entered into prior to December 2, 1980, or which (1) applies to any land which is subject to an agreement, and (2) was entered into before the agreement becomes effective.
<br>(g) State jurisdiction

<br>§1640. Relinquishment of selections partly within conservation units
<br>
<br>Whenever a valid State or Native selection is partly in and partly out of the boundary of a conservation system unit, notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the State or any Native Corporation may relinquish its rights in any portion of any validly selected Federal land, including land underneath waters, which lies within the boundary of the conservation system unit. Upon relinquishment, the Federal land (including land underneath waters) so relinquished within the boundary of the conservation system unit shall become, and be administered as, a part of the conservation system unit. The total land entitlement of the State or Native Corporation shall not be affected by such relinquishment. In lieu of the lands and waters relinquished by the State, the State may select pursuant to the Alaska Statehood Act as amended by this Act, an equal acreage of other lands available for such purpose. The Native Corporation may retain an equal acreage from overselection lands on which selection applications were otherwise properly and timely filed. A relinquishment pursuant to this section shall not invalidate an otherwise valid State or Native Corporation land selection outside the boundaries of the conservation system unit, on the grounds that, after such relinquishment, the remaining portion of the land selection no longer meets applicable requirements of size, compactness, or contiguity, or that the portion of the selection retained immediately outside the conservation system unit does not follow section lines along the boundary of the conservation system unit. The validity of the selection outside such boundary shall not be adversely affected by the relinquishment.

<br>§1641. Conveyances to Village Corporations
<br>(a) Optional procedure
<br>
<br>The provisions of this section shall be applicable only to the conveyance of Federal lands described herein to a Native Corporation which within one hundred and eighty days after December 2, 1980, or the date of eligibility determination, whichever is later, files a document with the Secretary setting forth its election to receive conveyance pursuant to this section.
<br>(b) "Core" townships, etc.
<br>
<br>(1)(A) Except to the extent that conveyance of a surface estate would be inconsistent with section 12(a), 14(a), 14(b), or 22(l) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1611(a), 1613(a), 1613(b), or 1621(l)], subject to valid existing rights and section 1633(a) of this title, there is hereby conveyed to and vested in each Village Corporation for a Native Village which is determined by the Secretary to be eligible for land under section 11 or 16 of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1610 or 1615] and which did not elect to acquire a former reserve under section 19(b) of such Act [43 U.S.C. 1618(b)], all of the right, title, and interest of the United States in and to the surface estate in the public lands, as defined in such Act [43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.], in the township or townships withdrawn pursuant to section 11(a)(1) or 16(a) of such Act [43 U.S.C. 1610(a)(1) or 1615(a)] in which all or any part of such Village is located. As used in this paragraph the term "Native Village" has the same meaning such term has in section 3(c) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1602(c)].
<br>
<br>(B) Where two or more Village Corporations are entitled to the same land by virtue of the same township or townships embracing all or part of the Native Villages, the conveyance made by paragraph (A) shall not be effective as to such lands until an arbitration decision or other binding agreement between or among the Corporations is filed with and published by the Secretary. Within thirty days of receipt of such decision or agreement, the Secretary shall publish notice of the decision or agreement in the Federal Register. Effective with such publication, title to the lands conveyed by subparagraph (A) shall vest in the Village Corporation as specified in the decision or agreement. For purposes of section 1632 of this title, until title vests in the Village Corporation pursuant to this subparagraph, the Secretary shall consider the entire acreage involved chargeable to each Corporation's entitlement.
<br>
<br>(2) Except to the extent that conveyance of a surface estate would be inconsistent with section 12(a), 14(a), or 22(l) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1611(a), 1613(a), or 1621(l)], subject to valid existing rights and section 1633(a) of this title, there is hereby conveyed to and vested in each Village Corporation for a Native Village which is determined by the Secretary to be eligible for land under section 11 of such Act [43 U.S.C. 1610], and which did not elect to acquire a former reserve under section 19(b) of such Act [43 U.S.C. 1618(b)], all of the right, title, and interest of the United States in and to the surface estate in the township or townships withdrawn pursuant to section 11(a)(2) of such Act [43 U.S.C. 1610(a)(2)] in which all or any part of such village is located: Provided, That any such land reserved to or selected by the State of Alaska under the Acts of March 4, 1915 (38 Stat. 1214), as amended, January 21, 1929 (45 Stat. 1091), as amended, or July 28, 1956 (70 Stat. 709), and lands selected by the State which have been tentatively approved to the State under section 6(g) of the Alaska Statehood Act and as to which the State, prior to December 18, 1971, had conditionally granted title to, or contracts to purchase, the surface estate to third parties, including cities and boroughs within the State, and such reservations, selections, grants, and contracts had not expired or been relinquished or revoked by December 2, 1980, shall not be conveyed by operation of this paragraph: And provided further, That the provisions of subparagraph (1)(B) of this subsection shall apply to the conveyances under this paragraph.
<br>
<br>(3) Subject to valid existing rights and section 1633(a) of this title, there is hereby conveyed to and vested in each Village Corporation which, by December 2, 1980, is determined by the Secretary to be eligible under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.] to, and has elected to, acquire title to any estate pursuant to section 19(b) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1618(b)], all of the right, title, and interest of the United States in and to the estates in a reserve, as such reserve existed on December 18, 1971, which was set aside for the use or benefit of the stockholders or members of such Corporation before December 18, 1971. Nothing in this paragraph shall apply to the Village Corporation for the Native village of Klukwan, which Corporation shall receive those rights granted to it by the Act of January 2, 1976 (Public Law 94–204) as amended by the Act of October 4, 1976 (Public Law 94–456).
<br>
<br>(4) Subject to valid existing rights and section 1633(a) of this title, and except where such lands are within a National Wildlife Refuge or the National Petroleum Reserve—Alaska, for which the Regional Corporation obtains in-lieu rights pursuant to section 12(a)(1) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1611(a)(1)], there is hereby conveyed to and vested in each Regional Corporation which, as a result of a conveyance of a surface estate by operation of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, is entitled under section 14(f) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1613(f)] to receive the subsurface estate corresponding to such surface estate, all of the right, title, and interest of the United States in and to such subsurface estate.
<br>(c) Documents
<br>
<br>As soon as possible after December 2, 1980, the Secretary shall issue to each Native Corporation referred to in subsection (b) interim conveyances or patents to the estate or estates conveyed to such Corporation by such subsection, but title shall be deemed to have passed on the date of the filing of a document of election described in subsection (a), notwithstanding any delay in the issuance of the interim conveyances or patents.
<br>(d) Reconveyances; disputes
<br>
<br>A Village Corporation's obligation to reconvey lands under section 14(c) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1613(c)] shall arise only upon receipt of an interim conveyance or patent, whichever is earlier, under subsection (c) of this section or under such Act [43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.]. For purposes of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.], legislative conveyances made by, or interim conveyances and patents issued pursuant to, this title shall have the same effect as if issued pursuant to sections 14(a), 14(b), 14(f), and 19(b) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1613(a), 1613(b), 1613(f), and 1618(b)] and shall be deemed to have been so issued. Disputes between or among Native Corporations arising from conveyances under this Act shall be resolved by a board of arbitrators of a type described in section 12(e) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1611(e)] pertaining to disputes over land selection rights and the boundaries of Village Corporations.
<br>(e) Existing rights
<br>
<br>All conveyances made by operation of this section shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.] as if such conveyances or patents had been made or issued pursuant to that Act.
<br>(f) Easements
<br>
<br>For a period of one year from December 2, 1980, the Secretary may identify and issue a decision to reserve in the patent those easements, pursuant to section 17(b)(3) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1616(b)(3)], which are described in section 17(b)(1) of such Act [43 U.S.C. 1616(b)(1)] on lands conveyed by this section, but the Secretary shall not reserve a greater number of easements or more land for a particular easement or easements than is reasonably necessary and he shall be guided by the principles of section 1633 of this title. Upon the finality of the decision so issued, such easements shall be reserved in the conveyance document or documents issued by the Secretary as required by this section.
<br>(g) "Native Corporation" defined
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, the term "Native Corporation" means Village Corporations and Regional Corporations.

<br>The Congress finds and declares that:
<br>
<br>(a) The early development and delivery of oil and gas from Alaska's North Slope to domestic markets is in the national interest because of growing domestic shortages and increasing dependence upon insecure foreign sources.
<br>
<br>(b) The Department of the Interior and other Federal agencies, have, over a long period of time, conducted extensive studies of the technical aspects and of the environmental, social, and economic impacts of the proposed trans-Alaska oil pipeline, including consideration of a trans-Canada pipeline.
<br>
<br>(c) The earliest possible construction of a trans-Alaska oil pipeline from the North Slope of Alaska to Port Valdez in that State will make the extensive proven and potential reserves of low-sulfur oil available for domestic use and will best serve the national interest.
<br>
<br>(d) A supplemental pipeline to connect the North Slope with a trans-Canada pipeline may be needed later and it should be studied now, but it should not be regarded as an alternative for a trans-Alaska pipeline that does not traverse a foreign country.

<br>North Slope Crude Oil; Report on Equitable Allocation
<br>
<br>Pub.

<br>Trans-Canada Pipeline; Negotiations With Canada; Feasibility Study
<br>
<br>Pub.

The President was to report to Congress on actions taken and recommendations for further action. In addition, the Secretary of the Interior was to investigate, and to report to Congress within 2 years of Nov. 16, 1973, as to the feasibility of oil or gas pipelines from the North Slope of Alaska to connect with a pipeline through Canada that would deliver oil or gas to United States markets. Nothing in title III was to limit the authority of the Secretary or any other Federal official to grant a gas or oil pipeline right-of-way or permit, which that official was otherwise authorized by law to grant.

<br>
<br>Pub. L. 93–153, title IV, §410, Nov. 16, 1973, 87 Stat. 594, provided that: "The Congress declares that the crude oil on the North Slope of Alaska is an important part of the Nation's oil resources, and that the benefits of such crude oil should be equitably shared, directly or indirectly, by all regions of the country.

<br>§1652. Authorizations for construction
<br>(a) Congressional declaration of purpose
<br>
<br>The purpose of this chapter is to insure that, because of the extensive governmental studies already made of this project and the national interest in early delivery of North Slope oil to domestic markets, the trans-Alaska oil pipeline be constructed promptly without further administrative or judicial delay or impediment. To accomplish this purpose it is the intent of the Congress to exercise its constitutional powers to the fullest extent in the authorizations and directions herein made and in limiting judicial review of the actions taken pursuant thereto.
<br>(b) Issuance, administration, and enforcement of rights-of-way, permits, leases, and other authorizations
<br>
<br>The Congress hereby authorizes and directs the Secretary of the Interior and other appropriate Federal officers and agencies to issue and take all necessary action to administer and enforce rights-of-way, permits, leases, and other authorizations that are necessary for or related to the construction, operation, and maintenance of the trans-Alaska oil pipeline system, including roads and airstrips, as that system is generally described in the Final Environmental Impact Statement issued by the Department of the Interior on March 20, 1972. The route of the pipeline may be modified by the Secretary to provide during construction greater environmental protection.
<br>(c) Applicability of statutes governing rights-of-way for pipelines through Federal lands; other statutory terms and conditions; waiver of procedural requirements; supersedure of administrative authorizations for construction
<br>
<br>Rights-of-way, permits, leases, and other authorizations issued pursuant to this chapter by the Secretary shall be subject to the provisions of section 185 of title 30, as amended by Pub. L. 93–153 (except the provisions of subsections (h)(1), (k), (q), (w)(2), and (x)); all authorizations issued by the Secretary and other Federal officers and agencies pursuant to this chapter shall include the terms and conditions required, and may include the terms and conditions permitted, by the provisions of law that would otherwise be applicable if this chapter had not been enacted, and they may waive any procedural requirements of law or regulation which they deem desirable to waive in order to accomplish the purposes of this chapter. The direction contained in subsection (b) shall supersede the provisions of any law or regulation relating to an administrative determination as to whether the authorizations for construction of the trans-Alaska oil pipeline shall be issued.
<br>(d) National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 bypassed; issuance of authorizations for construction and operation not to be subject to judicial review; time limits on charges of invalidity or unconstitutionality; jurisdiction; hearings; review
<br>
<br>The actions taken pursuant to this chapter which relate to the construction and completion of the pipeline system, and to the applications filed in connection therewith necessary to the pipeline's operation at full capacity, as described in the Final Environmental Impact Statement of the Department of the Interior, shall be taken without further action under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 [42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.]; and the actions of the Federal officers concerning the issuance of the necessary rights-of-way, permits, leases, and other authorizations for construction and initial operation at full capacity of said pipeline system shall not be subject to judicial review under any law except that claims alleging the invalidity of this section may be brought within sixty days following November 16, 1973, and claims alleging that an action will deny rights under the Constitution of the United States, or that the action is beyond the scope of authority conferred by this chapter, may be brought within sixty days following the date of such action. A claim shall be barred unless a complaint is filed within the time specified. Any such complaint shall be filed in a United States district court, and such court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to determine such proceeding in accordance with the procedures hereinafter provided, and no other court of the United States, of any State, territory, or possession of the United States, or of the District of Columbia, shall have jurisdiction of any such claim whether in a proceeding instituted prior to or on or after November 16, 1973. Such court shall not have jurisdiction to grant any injunctive relief against the issuance of any right-of-way, permit, lease, or other authorization pursuant to this section except in conjunction with a final judgment entered in a case involving a claim filed pursuant to this section. An interlocutory or final judgment, decree, or order of such district court may be reviewed only upon petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States.
<br>(e) Amendment or modification of rights-of-way, permits, leases, or other authorizations
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Interior and the other Federal officers and agencies are authorized at any time when necessary to protect the public interest, pursuant to the authority of this section and in accordance with its provisions, to amend or modify any right-of-way, permit, lease, or other authorization issued under this chapter.

Liability of such holders for damages in excess of $350,000,000 shall be in accord with ordinary rules of negligence.
<br>
<br>(3) In any case where liability without fault is imposed pursuant to this subsection and the damages involved were caused by the negligence of a third party, the rules of subrogation shall apply in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction where the damage occurred.
<br>
<br>(4) Upon order of the Secretary, the holder of a right-of-way or permit shall provide emergency subsistence and other aid to an affected Alaska Native, Native organization, or other person pending expeditious filing of, and determination of, a claim under this subsection.
<br>
<br>(5) Where the State of Alaska is the holder of a right-of-way or permit under this chapter, the State shall not be subject to the provisions of this subsection, but the holder of the permit or right-of-way for the trans-Alaska pipeline shall be subject to this subsection with respect to facilities constructed or activities conducted under rights-of-way or permits issued to the State to the extent that such holder engages in the construction, operation, maintenance, and termination of facilities, or in other activities under rights-of-way or permits issued to the State.
<br>(b) Control and removal of pollutants at expense of right-of-way holder
<br>
<br>If any area in the State of Alaska within or without the right-of-way or permit area granted under this chapter is polluted by any activities related to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, including operation of the terminal, conducted by or on behalf of the holder to whom such right-of-way or permit was granted, and such pollution damages or threatens to damage aquatic life, wildlife, or public or private property, the control and total removal of the pollutant shall be at the expense of such holder, including any administrative and other costs incurred by the Secretary or any other Federal or State officer or agency. Upon failure of such holder to adequately control and remove such pollutant, the Secretary, in cooperation with other Federal, State, or local agencies, or in cooperation with such holder, or both, shall have the right to accomplish the control and removal at the expense of such holder.

<br>SUBCHAPTER I—GENERAL PROVISIONS
<br>§1701. Congressional declaration of policy
<br>
<br>(a) The Congress declares that it is the policy of the United States that—
<br>
<br>(1) the public lands be retained in Federal ownership, unless as a result of the land use planning procedure provided for in this Act, it is determined that disposal of a particular parcel will serve the national interest;
<br>
<br>(2) the national interest will be best realized if the public lands and their resources are periodically and systematically inventoried and their present and future use is projected through a land use planning process coordinated with other Federal and State planning efforts;
<br>
<br>(3) public lands not previously designated for any specific use and all existing classifications of public lands that were effected by executive action or statute before October 21, 1976, be reviewed in accordance with the provisions of this Act;
<br>
<br>(4) the Congress exercise its constitutional authority to withdraw or otherwise designate or dedicate Federal lands for specified purposes and that Congress delineate the extent to which the Executive may withdraw lands without legislative action;
<br>
<br>(5) in administering public land statutes and exercising discretionary authority granted by them, the Secretary be required to establish comprehensive rules and regulations after considering the views of the general public; and to structure adjudication procedures to assure adequate third party participation, objective administrative review of initial decisions, and expeditious decisionmaking;
<br>
<br>(6) judicial review of public land adjudication decisions be provided by law;
<br>
<br>(7) goals and objectives be established by law as guidelines for public land use planning, and that management be on the basis of multiple use and sustained yield unless otherwise specified by law;
<br>
<br>(8) the public lands be managed in a manner that will protect the quality of scientific, scenic, historical, ecological, environmental, air and atmospheric, water resource, and archeological values; that, where appropriate, will preserve and protect certain public lands in their natural condition; that will provide food and habitat for fish and wildlife and domestic animals; and that will provide for outdoor recreation and human occupancy and use;
<br>
<br>(9) the United States receive fair market value of the use of the public lands and their resources unless otherwise provided for by statute;
<br>
<br>(10) uniform procedures for any disposal of public land, acquisition of non-Federal land for public purposes, and the exchange of such lands be established by statute, requiring each disposal, acquisition, and exchange to be consistent with the prescribed mission of the department or agency involved, and reserving to the Congress review of disposals in excess of a specified acreage;
<br>
<br>(11) regulations and plans for the protection of public land areas of critical environmental concern be promptly developed;
<br>
<br>(12) the public lands be managed in a manner which recognizes the Nation's need for domestic sources of minerals, food, timber, and fiber from the public lands including implementation of the Mining and Minerals Policy Act of 1970 (84 Stat. 1876, 30 U.S.C. 21a) as it pertains to the public lands; and
<br>
<br>(13) the Federal Government should, on a basis equitable to both the Federal and local taxpayer, provide for payments to compensate States and local governments for burdens created as a result of the immunity of Federal lands from State and local taxation.
<br>
<br>(b) The policies of this Act shall become effective only as specific statutory authority for their implementation is enacted by this Act or by subsequent legislation and shall then be construed as supplemental to and not in derogation of the purposes for which public lands are administered under other provisions of law.

<br>SUBCHAPTER II—LAND USE PLANNING AND LAND ACQUISITION AND DISPOSITION
<br>§1711. Continuing inventory and identification of public lands; preparation and maintenance
<br>
<br>(a) The Secretary shall prepare and maintain on a continuing basis an inventory of all public lands and their resource and other values (including, but not limited to, outdoor recreation and scenic values), giving priority to areas of critical environmental concern. This inventory shall be kept current so as to reflect changes in conditions and to identify new and emerging resource and other values. The preparation and maintenance of such inventory or the identification of such areas shall not, of itself, change or prevent change of the management or use of public lands.
<br>
<br>(b) As funds and manpower are made available, the Secretary shall ascertain the boundaries of the public lands; provide means of public identification thereof including, where appropriate, signs and maps; and provide State and local governments with data from the inventory for the purpose of planning and regulating the uses of non-Federal lands in proximity of such public lands.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 94–579, title II, §201, Oct. 21, 1976, 90 Stat. 2747.)

<br>(b) Coordination of plans for National Forest System lands with Indian land use planning and management programs for purposes of development and revision
<br>
<br>In the development and revision of land use plans, the Secretary of Agriculture shall coordinate land use plans for lands in the National Forest System with the land use planning and management programs of and for Indian tribes by, among other things, considering the policies of approved tribal land resource management programs.
<br>(c) Criteria for development and revision
<br>
<br>In the development and revision of land use plans, the Secretary shall—
<br>
<br>(1) use and observe the principles of multiple use and sustained yield set forth in this and other applicable law;
<br>
<br>(2) use a systematic interdisciplinary approach to achieve integrated consideration of physical, biological, economic, and other sciences;
<br>
<br>(3) give priority to the designation and protection of areas of critical environmental concern;
<br>
<br>(4) rely, to the extent it is available, on the inventory of the public lands, their resources, and other values;
<br>
<br>(5) consider present and potential uses of the public lands;
<br>
<br>(6) consider the relative scarcity of the values involved and the availability of alternative means (including recycling) and sites for realization of those values;
<br>
<br>(7) weigh long-term benefits to the public against short-term benefits;
