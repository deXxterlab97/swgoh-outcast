<br>is not less than 35 percent of the appraised value of the product at the time it is entered into the United States.
<br>
<br>For purposes of determining the 35 percent content requirement contained in paragraph (3), the cost or value of materials which are used in the production of an article in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, or a qualifying industrial zone, and are the products of the United States, may be counted in an amount up to 15 percent of the appraised value of the article.
<br>
<br>"(b) Applicability of Certain Provisions of the Agreement.—
<br>
<br>"(1) Nonqualifying operations.—No article shall be considered a new or different article of commerce under this section, and no material shall be included for purposes of determining the 35 percent requirement of subsection (a)(3), by virtue of having merely undergone—
<br>
<br>"(A) simple combining or packaging operations, or
<br>
<br>"(B) mere dilution with water or with another substance that does not materially alter the characteristics of the article or material.
<br>
<br>"(2) Requirements for new or different article of commerce.—For purposes of subsection (a)(1), an article is a 'new or different article of commerce' if it is substantially transformed into an article having a new name, character, or use.
<br>
<br>"(3) Cost or value of materials.—(A) For purposes of this section, the cost or value of materials produced in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, or a qualifying industrial zone includes—
<br>
<br>"(i) the manufacturer's actual cost for the materials;
<br>
<br>"(ii) when not included in the manufacturer's actual cost for the materials, the freight, insurance, packing, and all other costs incurred in transporting the materials to the manufacturer's plant;
<br>
<br>"(iii) the actual cost of waste or spoilage, less the value of recoverable scrap; and
<br>
<br>"(iv) taxes or duties imposed on the materials by the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, or a qualifying industrial zone, if such taxes or duties are not remitted on exportation.
<br>
<br>"(B) If a material is provided to the manufacturer without charge, or at less than fair market value, its cost or value shall be determined by computing the sum of—
<br>
<br>"(i) all expenses incurred in the growth, production, or manufacture of the material, including general expenses;
<br>
<br>"(ii) an amount for profit; and
<br>
<br>"(iii) freight, insurance, packing, and all other costs incurred in transporting the material to the manufacturer's plant.
<br>
<br>If the information necessary to compute the cost or value of a material is not available, the Customs Service may ascertain or estimate the value thereof using all reasonable methods.
<br>
<br>"(4) Direct costs of processing operations.—(A) For purposes of this section, the 'direct costs of processing operations performed in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, or a qualifying industrial zone' with respect to an article are those costs either directly incurred in, or which can be reasonably allocated to, the growth, production, manufacture, or assembly, of that article. Such costs include, but are not limited to, the following to the extent that they are includible in the appraised value of articles imported into the United States:
<br>
<br>"(i) All actual labor costs involved in the growth, production, manufacture, or assembly of the article, including fringe benefits, on-the-job training, and costs of engineering, supervisory, quality control, and similar personnel.
<br>
<br>"(ii) Dies, molds, tooling, and depreciation on machinery and equipment which are allocable to the article.
<br>
<br>"(iii) Research, development, design, engineering, and blueprint costs insofar as they are allocable to the article.
<br>
<br>"(iv) Costs of inspecting and testing the article.
<br>
<br>"(B) Those items that are not included as direct costs of processing operations with respect to an article are those which are not directly attributable to the article or are not costs of manufacturing the article. Such items include, but are not limited to—
<br>
<br>"(i) profit; and
<br>
<br>"(ii) general expenses of doing business which are either not allocable to the article or are not related to the growth, production, manufacture, or assembly of the article, such as administrative salaries, casualty and liability insurance, advertising, and salesmen's salaries, commissions, or expenses.
<br>
<br>"(5) Imported directly.—For purposes of this section—
<br>
<br>"(A) articles are 'imported directly' if—
<br>
<br>"(i) the articles are shipped directly from the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, a qualifying industrial zone, or Israel into the United States without passing through the territory of any intermediate country; or
<br>
<br>"(ii) if shipment is through the territory of an intermediate country, the articles in the shipment do not enter into the commerce of any intermediate country and the invoices, bills of lading, and other shipping documents specify the United States as the final destination; or
<br>
<br>"(B) if articles are shipped through an intermediate country and the invoices and other documents do not specify the United States as the final destination, then the articles in the shipment, upon arrival in the United States, are imported directly only if they—
<br>
<br>"(i) remain under the control of the customs authority in an intermediate country;
<br>
<br>"(ii) do not enter into the commerce of an intermediate country except for the purpose of a sale other than at retail, but only if the articles are imported as a result of the original commercial transactions between the importer and the producer or the producer's sales agent; and
<br>
<br>"(iii) have not been subjected to operations other than loading, unloading, or other activities necessary to preserve the article in good condition.
<br>
<br>"(6) Documentation required.—An article is eligible for the duty exemption under this section only if—
<br>
<br>"(A) the importer certifies that the article meets the conditions for the duty exemption; and
<br>
<br>"(B) when requested by the Customs Service, the importer, manufacturer, or exporter submits a declaration setting forth all pertinent information with respect to the article, including the following:
<br>
<br>"(i) A description of the article, quantity, numbers, and marks of packages, invoice numbers, and bills of lading.
<br>
<br>"(ii) A description of the operations performed in the production of the article in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, a qualifying industrial zone, or Israel and identification of the direct costs of processing operations.
<br>
<br>"(iii) A description of any materials used in production of the article which are wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, a qualifying industrial zone, Israel or United States, and a statement as to the cost or value of such materials.
<br>
<br>"(iv) A description of the operations performed on, and a statement as to the origin and cost or value of, any foreign materials used in the article which are claimed to have been sufficiently processed in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, a qualifying industrial zone, or Israel so as to be materials produced in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, a qualifying industrial zone, or Israel.
<br>
<br>"(v) A description of the origin and cost or value of any foreign materials used in the article which have not been substantially transformed in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, or a qualifying industrial zone.
<br>
<br>"(c) Shipment of Articles of Israel Through West Bank or Gaza Strip.—The President is authorized to proclaim that articles of Israel may be treated as though they were articles directly shipped from Israel for the purposes of the Agreement even if shipped to the United States from the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, or a qualifying industrial zone, if the articles otherwise meet the requirements of the Agreement.
<br>
<br>"(d) Treatment of Cost or Value of Materials.—The President is authorized to proclaim that the cost or value of materials produced in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, or a qualifying industrial zone may be included in the cost or value of materials produced in Israel under section 1(c)(i) of Annex 3 of the Agreement, and the direct costs of processing operations performed in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, or a qualifying industrial zone may be included in the direct costs of processing operations performed in Israel under section 1(c)(ii) of Annex 3 of the Agreement.
<br>
<br>"(e) Qualifying Industrial Zone Defined.—For purposes of this section, a 'qualifying industrial zone' means any area that—
<br>
<br>"(1) encompasses portions of the territory of Israel and Jordan or Israel and Egypt;
<br>
<br>"(2) has been designated by local authorities as an enclave where merchandise may enter without payment of duty or excise taxes; and

<br>"SEC. 402. CRITERIA FOR DUTY-FREE TREATMENT OF ARTICLES.
<br>
<br>"(a)(1) The reduction or elimination of any duty imposed on any article by the United States provided for in a trade agreement entered into with Israel under section 102(b)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2112(b)(1)] shall apply only if—
<br>
<br>"(A) that article is the growth, product, or manufacture of Israel or is a new or different article of commerce that has been grown, produced, or manufactured in Israel;
<br>
<br>"(B) that article is imported directly from Israel into the customs territory of the United States; and

<br>"(i) the cost of value of the materials produced in Israel, plus
<br>
<br>"(ii) the direct costs of processing operations performed in Israel,

<br>is not less than 35 percent of the appraised value of such article at the time it is entered.
<br>
<br>If the cost or value of materials produced in the customs territory of the United States is included with respect to an article to which this subsection applies, an amount not to exceed 15 percent of the appraised value of the article at the time it is entered that is attributable to such United States cost or value may be applied toward determining the percentage referred to in subparagraph (C).
<br>
<br>"(2) No article may be considered to meet the requirements of paragraph (1)(A) by virtue of having merely undergone—
<br>
<br>"(A) simple combining or packaging operations; or
<br>
<br>"(B) mere dilution with water or mere dilution with another substance that does not materially alter the characteristics of the article.
<br>
<br>"(b) As used in this section, the phrase 'direct costs of processing operations' includes, but is not limited to—
<br>
<br>"(1) all actual labor costs involved in the growth, production, manufacture, or assembly of the specific merchandise, including fringe benefits, on-the-job training and the cost of engineering, supervisory, quality control, and similar personnel; and

<br>Such phrase does not include costs which are not directly attributable to the merchandise concerned, or are not costs of manufacturing the product, such as (A) profit, and (B) general expenses of doing business which are either not allocable to the specific merchandise or are not related to the growth, production, manufacture, or assembly of the merchandise, such as administrative salaries, casualty and liability insurance, advertising, and salesmen's salaries, commissions or expenses.
<br>
<br>"(c) Regulations.—The Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the United States Trade Representative, shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out this section.
<br>"SEC. 403. APPLICATION OF CERTAIN OTHER TRADE LAW PROVISIONS.
<br>
<br>"(a) Suspension of Duty-Free Treatment.—The President may by proclamation suspend the reduction or elimination of any duty provided under any trade agreement provision entered into with Israel under the authority of section 102(b)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2112(b)(1)] with respect to any article and may proclaim a duty rate for such article if such action is proclaimed under section 203 of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2253] or section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 [19 U.S.C. 1862].
<br>
<br>"(b) ITC Reports.—In any report by the United States International Trade Commission (hereinafter referred to in this title [this note] as the 'Commission') to the President under section 202(f) of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2252(f)] regarding any article for which a reduction or elimination of any duty is provided under a trade agreement entered into with Israel under section 102(b)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2112(b)(1)], the Commission shall state whether and to what extent its findings and recommendations apply to such an article when imported from Israel.
<br>
<br>"(c) For purposes of section 203 of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2253], the suspension of the reduction or elimination of a duty under subsection (a) shall be treated as an increase in duty.
<br>
<br>"(d) No proclamation which provides solely for a suspension referred to in subsection (a) with respect to any article shall be made under section 203 of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2253], unless the Commission, in addition to making an affirmative determination with respect to such article under section 202(b) of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2252(b)], determines in the course of its investigation under that section that the serious injury (or threat thereof) substantially caused by imports to the domestic industry producing a like or directly competitive article results from the reduction or elimination of any duty provided under any trade agreement provision entered into with Israel under section 102(b)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2112(b)(1)].
<br>
<br>"(e)(1) Any proclamation issued under section 203 of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2253] that is in effect when an agreement with Israel is entered into under section 102(b)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2112(b)(1)] shall remain in effect until modified or terminated.
<br>
<br>"(2) If any article is subject to import relief at the time an agreement is entered into with Israel under section 102(b)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2112(b)(1)], the President may reduce or terminate the application of such import relief to the importation of such article before the otherwise scheduled date on which such reduction or termination would occur pursuant to the criteria and procedures of sections 203 and 204 of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2253, 2254].
<br>"SEC. 404. FAST TRACK PROCEDURES FOR PERISHABLE ARTICLES.

<br>"(a) If a petition is filed with the Commission under the provisions of section 202(a) of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2252(a)] regarding a perishable product which is subject to any reduction or elimination of a duty imposed by the United States under a trade agreement entered into with Israel under section 102(b)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2112(b)(1)] and alleges injury from imports of that product, then the petition may also be filed with the Secretary of Agriculture with a request that emergency relief be granted under subsection (c) with respect to such article.
<br>
<br>"(b) Within 14 days after the filing of a petition under subsection (a)—
<br>
<br>"(1) if the Secretary of Agriculture has reason to believe that a perishable product from Israel is being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury, or the threat thereof, to the domestic industry producing a perishable product like or directly competitive with the imported product and that emergency action is warranted, he shall advise the President and recommend that the President take emergency action; or
<br>
<br>"(2) the Secretary of Agriculture shall publish a notice of his determination not to recommend the imposition of emergency action and so advise the petitioner.
<br>
<br>"(c) Within 7 days after the President receives a recommendation from the Secretary of Agriculture to take emergency action under subsection (b), he shall issue a proclamation withdrawing the reduction or elimination of duty provided to the perishable product under any trade agreement provision entered into under section 102(b)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2112(b)(1)] or publish a notice of his determination not to take emergency action.
<br>
<br>"(d) The emergency action provided under subsection (c) shall cease to apply—
<br>
<br>"(1) upon the taking of actions under section 203 of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2253];
<br>
<br>"(2) on the day a determination of the President under section 203 of such Act [19 U.S.C. 2253] not to take action becomes final;
<br>
<br>"(3) in the event of a report of the Commission containing a negative finding, on the day the Commission's report is submitted to the President; or
<br>
<br>"(4) whenever the President determines that because of changed circumstances such relief is no longer warranted.
<br>
<br>"(e) For purposes of this section, the term 'perishable product' means any—
<br>
<br>"(1) live plants and fresh cut flowers provided for in chapter 6 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202, hereinafter referred to as the 'HTS');
<br>

<br>
<br>"Neither the taking effect of any trade agreement provision entered into with Israel under section 102(b)(1) [19 U.S.C. 2112(b)(1)], nor any proclamation issued to implement any such provision, may affect in any manner, or to any extent, the application to any Israeli articles of section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 [19 U.S.C. 1862], section 337 of title VII [probably should be "title III" of the Tariff Act of 1930 [19 U.S.C. 1337], chapter 1 of title II and chapter 1 of title III of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2251 et seq., 2411 et seq.], or any other provision of law under which relief from injury caused by import competition or by unfair import trade practices may be sought."

<br>
<br>By virtue of the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America, including the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement Implementation Act of 1988 (Public Law 100–449, 102 Stat. 1851) ("FTA Implementation Act") [set out as a note above], it is hereby ordered as follows:
<br>
<br>Section 1. [Superseded by Ex. Ord. No. 12889, §4(c), Dec. 27, 1993, 58 F.R. 69681, see 19 U.S.C. 3311 note.]

<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13141. Environmental Review of Trade Agreements
<br>
<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13141, Nov. 16, 1999, 64 F.R. 63169, provided:
<br>
<br>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to further the environmental and trade policy goals of the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:
<br>
<br>Section 1. Policy. The United States is committed to a policy of careful assessment and consideration of the environmental impacts of trade agreements. The United States will factor environmental considerations into the development of its trade negotiating objectives. Responsible agencies will accomplish these goals through a process of ongoing assessment and evaluation, and, in certain instances, written environmental reviews.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. Purpose and Need. Trade agreements should contribute to the broader goal of sustainable development. Environmental reviews are an important tool to help identify potential environmental effects of trade agreements, both positive and negative, and to help facilitate consideration of appropriate responses to those effects whether in the course of negotiations, through other means, or both.
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. (a) Implementation. The United States Trade Representative (Trade Representative) and the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality shall oversee the implementation of this order, including the development of procedures pursuant to this order, in consultation with appropriate foreign policy, environmental, and economic agencies.
<br>
<br>(b) Conduct of Environmental Reviews. The Trade Representative, through the interagency Trade Policy Staff Committee (TPSC), shall conduct the environmental reviews of the agreements under section 4 of this order.
<br>
<br>Sec. 4. Trade Agreements.
<br>
<br>(a) Certain agreements that the United States may negotiate shall require an environmental review. These include:
<br>
<br>(i) comprehensive multilateral trade rounds;
<br>
<br>(ii) bilateral or plurilateral free trade agreements; and
<br>
<br>(iii) major new trade liberalization agreements in natural resource sectors.
<br>
<br>(b) Agreements reached in connection with enforcement and dispute resolution actions are not covered by this order.
<br>
<br>(c) For trade agreements not covered under subsections 4(a) and (b), environmental reviews will generally not be required. Most sectoral liberalization agreements will not require an environmental review. The Trade Representative, through the TPSC, shall determine whether an environmental review of an agreement or category of agreements is warranted based on such factors as the significance of reasonably foreseeable environmental impacts.
<br>
<br>Sec. 5. Environmental Reviews.
<br>
<br>(a) Environmental reviews shall be:
<br>
<br>(i) written;
<br>
<br>(ii) initiated through a Federal Register notice, outlining the proposed agreement and soliciting public comment and information on the scope of the environmental review of the agreement;
<br>
<br>(iii) undertaken sufficiently early in the process to inform the development of negotiating positions, but shall not be a condition for the timely tabling of particular negotiating proposals;
<br>
<br>(iv) made available in draft form for public comment, where practicable; and
<br>
<br>(v) made available to the public in final form.
<br>
<br>(b) As a general matter, the focus of environmental reviews will be impacts in the United States. As appropriate and prudent, reviews may also examine global and transboundary impacts.
<br>
<br>Sec. 6. Resources. Upon request by the Trade Representative, with the concurrence of the Deputy Director for Management of the Office of Management and Budget, Federal agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations, provide analytical and financial resources and support, including the detail of appropriate personnel, to the Office of the United States Trade Representative to carry out the provisions of this order.
<br>
<br>Sec. 7. General Provisions. This order is intended only to improve the internal management of the executive branch and does not create any right, benefit, trust, or responsibility, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or any person.

<br>§2114. Sector negotiating objective
<br>(a) Obtaining equivalent competitive opportunities
<br>
<br>A principal United States negotiating objective under sections 2111 and 2112 of this title shall be to obtain, to the maximum extent feasible, with respect to appropriate product sectors of manufacturing, and with respect to the agricultural sector, competitive opportunities for United States exports to the developed countries of the world equivalent to the competitive opportunities afforded in United States markets to the importation of like or similar products, taking into account all barriers (including tariffs) to and other distortions of international trade affecting that sector.
<br>(b) Conduct of negotiations on basis of appropriate product sectors of manufacturing
<br>
<br>As a means of achieving the negotiating objective set forth in subsection (a), to the extent consistent with the objective of maximizing overall economic benefit to the United States (through maintaining and enlarging foreign markets for products of United States agriculture, industry, mining, and commerce, through the development of fair and equitable market opportunities, and through open and nondiscriminatory world trade), negotiations shall, to the extent feasible be conducted on the basis of appropriate product sectors of manufacturing.
<br>(c) Identification of appropriate product sectors of manufacturing
<br>
<br>For the purposes of this section and section 2155 of this title, the United States Trade Representative together with the Secretary of Commerce, Agriculture, or Labor, as appropriate, shall, after consultation with the Advisory Committee for Trade Negotiations established under section 2155 of this title and after consultation with interested private or non-Federal governmental organizations, identify appropriate product sectors of manufacturing.
<br>(d) Presidential analysis of how negotiating objectives are achieved in each product sector by trade agreements
<br>
<br>If the President determines that competitive opportunities in one or more product sectors will be significantly affected by a trade agreement concluded under section 2111 or 2112 of this title, he shall submit to the Congress with each such agreement an analysis of the extent to which the negotiating objective set forth in subsection (a) is achieved by such agreement in each product sector or product sectors.

<br>§2132. Balance-of-payments authority
<br>(a) Presidential proclamations of temporary import surcharges and temporary limitations on imports through quotas in situations of fundamental international payments problems
<br>
<br>Whenever fundamental international payments problems require special import measures to restrict imports—
<br>
<br>(1) to deal with large and serious United States balance-of-payments deficits.
<br>
<br>(2) to prevent an imminent and significant depreciation of the dollar in foreign exchange markets, or
<br>
<br>(3) to cooperate with other countries in correcting an international balance-of-payments disequilibrium,
<br>
<br>the President shall proclaim, for a period not exceeding 150 days (unless such period is extended by Act of Congress)—
<br>
<br>(A) a temporary import surcharge, not to exceed 15 percent ad valorem, in the form of duties (in addition to those already imposed, if any) on articles imported into the United States;
<br>
<br>(B) temporary limitations through the use of quotas on the importation of articles into the United States; or
<br>
<br>(C) both a temporary import surcharge described in subparagraph (A) and temporary limitations described in subparagraph (B).
<br>
<br>The authority delegated under subparagraph (B) (and so much of subparagraph (C) as relates to subparagraph (B)) may be exercised (i) only if international trade or monetary agreements to which the United States is a party permit the imposition of quotas as a balance-of-payments measure, and (ii) only to the extent that the fundamental imbalance cannot be dealt with effectively by a surcharge proclaimed pursuant to subparagraph (A) or (C). Any temporary import surcharge proclaimed pursuant to subparagraph (A) or (C) shall be treated as a regular customs duty.
<br>(b) Import restrictions not imposed when contrary to national interest of United States
<br>
<br>If the President determines that the imposition of import restrictions under subsection (a) will be contrary to the national interest of the United States, then he may refrain from proclaiming such restrictions and he shall—
<br>
<br>(1) immediately inform Congress of his determination, and
<br>
<br>(2) immediately convene the group of congressional official advisers designated under section 2211(a) of this title and consult with them as to the reasons for such determination.
<br>(c) Presidential proclamations liberalizing imports
<br>
<br>Whenever the President determines that fundamental international payments problems require special import measures to increase imports—
<br>
<br>(1) to deal with large and persistent United States balance-of-trade surpluses, as determined on the basis of the cost-insurance-freight value of imports, as reported by the Bureau of the Census, or
<br>
<br>(2) to prevent significant appreciation of the dollar in foreign exchange markets,
<br>
<br>the President is authorized to proclaim, for a period of 150 days (unless such period is extended by Act of Congress)—
<br>
<br>(A) a temporary reduction (of not more than 5 percent ad valorem) in the rate of duty on any article; and
<br>
<br>(B) a temporary increase in the value or quantity of articles which may be imported under any import restriction, or a temporary suspension of any import restriction.
<br>
<br>Import liberalizing actions proclaimed pursuant to this subsection shall be of broad and uniform application with respect to product coverage except that the President shall not proclaim measures under this subsection with respect to those articles where in his judgment such action will cause or contribute to material injury to firms or workers in any domestic industry, including agriculture, mining, fishing, or commerce, or to impairment of the national security, or will otherwise be contrary to the national interest.
<br>(d) Nondiscriminatory treatment of import restricting actions
<br>
<br>(1) Import restricting actions proclaimed pursuant to subsection (a) shall be applied consistently with the principle of nondiscriminatory treatment. In addition, any quota proclaimed pursuant to subparagraph (B) of subsection (a) shall be applied on a basis which aims at a distribution of trade with the United States approaching as closely as possible that which various foreign countries might have expected to obtain in the absence of such restrictions.
<br>
<br>(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), if the President determines that the purposes of this section will best be served by action against one or more countries having large or persistent balance-of-payments surpluses, he may exempt all other countries from such action.
<br>
<br>(3) After such time when there enters into force for the United States new rules regarding the application of surcharges as part of a reform of internationally agreed balance-of-payments adjustment procedures, the exemption authority contained in paragraph (2) shall be applied consistently with such new international rules.
<br>
<br>(4) It is the sense of Congress that the President seek modifications in international agreements aimed at allowing the use of surcharges in place of quantitative restrictions (and providing rules to govern the use of such surcharges) as a balance-of-payments adjustment measure within the context of arrangements for an equitable sharing of balance-of-payments adjustment responsibility among deficit and surplus countries.
<br>(e) Broad and uniform application of import restricting actions
<br>
<br>Import restricting actions proclaimed pursuant to subsection (a) shall be of broad and uniform application with respect to product coverage except where the President determines, consistently with the purposes of this section, that certain articles should not be subject to import restricting actions because of the needs of the United States economy. Such exceptions shall be limited to the unavailability of domestic supply at reasonable prices, the necessary importation of raw materials, avoiding serious dislocations in the supply of imported goods, and other similar factors. In addition, uniform exceptions may be made where import restricting actions will be unnecessary or ineffective in carrying out the purposes of this section, such as with respect to articles already subject to import restrictions, goods in transit, or goods under binding contract. Neither the authorization of import restricting actions nor the determination of exceptions with respect to product coverage shall be made for the purpose of protecting individual domestic industries from import competition.
<br>(f) Quantitative limitations
<br>
<br>Any quantitative limitation proclaimed pursuant to subparagraph (B) or (C) of subsection (a) on the quantity or value, or both, of an article—
<br>
<br>(1) shall permit the importation of a quantity or value which is not less than the quantity or value of such article imported into the United States from the foreign countries to which such limitation applies during the most recent period which the President determines is representative of imports of such article, and
<br>
<br>(2) shall take into account any increase since the end of such representative period in domestic consumption of such article and like or similar articles of domestic manufacture or production.
<br>(g) Suspension, modification, or termination of proclamations
<br>
<br>The President may at any time, consistent with the provisions of this section, suspend, modify, or terminate, in whole or in part, any proclamation under this section either during the initial 150-day period of effectiveness or as extended by subsequent Act of Congress.
<br>(h) Termination of tariff concessions
<br>
<br>No provision of law authorizing the termination of tariff concessions shall be used to impose a surcharge on imports into the United States.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 93–618, title I, §122, Jan. 3, 1975, 88 Stat. 1987.)
<br>§2133. Compensation authority
<br>(a) New concessions
<br>
<br>Whenever—
<br>
<br>(1) any action taken under part 1 of subchapter II or subchapter III, or under part 2 of subchapter IV of this chapter; or
<br>
<br>(2) any judicial or administrative tariff reclassification that becomes final after August 23, 1988;
<br>
<br>increases or imposes any duty or other import restriction, the President—
<br>
<br>(A) may enter into trade agreements with foreign countries or instrumentalities for the purpose of granting new concessions as compensation in order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions; and
<br>
<br>(B) may proclaim such modification or continuance of any existing duty, or such continuance of existing duty-free or excise treatment, as he determines to be required or appropriate to carry out any such agreement.
<br>(b) Reductions in rates of duty
<br>
<br>(1) No proclamation shall be made pursuant to subsection (a) decreasing any rate of duty to a rate which is less than 70 percent of the existing rate of duty.
<br>
<br>(2) Where the rate of duty in effect at any time is an intermediate stage under section 2902(a) of this title, the proclamation made pursuant to subsection (a) may provide for the reduction of each rate of duty at each such stage proclaimed under such section 2902(a) of this title by not more than 30 percent of such rate of duty, and may provide for a final rate of duty which is not less than 70 percent of the rate of duty proclaimed as the final stage under such section 2902(a) of this title.
<br>
<br>(3) If the President determines that such action will simplify the computation of the amount of duty imposed with respect to an article, he may exceed the limitations provided by paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection by not more than the lesser of—
<br>
<br>(A) the difference between such limitation and the next lower whole number, or
<br>
<br>(B) one-half of 1 percent ad valorem.
<br>
<br>(4) Any concessions granted under subsection (a)(1) shall be reduced and terminated according to substantially the same time schedule for reduction applicable to the relevant action under sections 2253(e) and 2254 of this title.
<br>(c) Consideration of past violations of trade concessions
<br>
<br>Before entering into any trade agreement under this section with any foreign country or instrumentality, the President shall consider whether such country or instrumentality has violated trade concessions of benefit to the United States and such violation has not been adequately offset by the action of the United States or by such country or instrumentality.
<br>(d) Basic authority for trade agreements as authority for granting new concessions as compensation
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a), the authority delegated under section 2902 of this title shall be used for the purpose of granting new concessions as compensation within the meaning of this section until such authority terminates.
<br>(e) International obligations determination prerequisite to application of authority
<br>
<br>The provisions of this section shall apply by reason of action taken under subchapter III only if the President determines that action authorized under this section is necessary or appropriate to meet the international obligations of the United States.
<br>

<br>§2134. Two-year residual authority to negotiate duties
<br>(a) Trade agreements
<br>
<br>Whenever the President determines that any existing duties or other import restrictions of any foreign country or the United States are unduly burdening and restricting the foreign trade of the United States and that the purposes of this chapter will be promoted thereby, the President—
<br>
<br>(1) may enter into trade agreements with foreign countries or instrumentalities thereof, and
<br>
<br>(2) may proclaim such modification or continuance of any existing duty, such continuance of existing duty-free or excise treatment, or such additional duties, as he determines to be required or appropriate to carry out any such trade agreement.

<br>
<br>(3) Where the rate of duty in effect at any time is an intermediate stage under section 2119 of this title, the proclamation made pursuant to subsection (a) may provide for the reduction of each rate of duty at each such stage proclaimed under section 2111 of this title by not more than 20 percent of such rate of duty, and, subject to the limitation in paragraph (2), may provide for a final rate of duty which is not less than 80 percent of the rate of duty proclaimed as the final stage under section 2111 of this title.
<br>
<br>(4) If the President determines that such action will simplify the computation of the amount of duty imposed with respect to an article, he may exceed the limitations provided by paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection by not more than the lesser of—
<br>
<br>(A) the difference between such limitation and the next lower whole number, or
<br>
<br>(B) one-half of 1 percent ad valorem.
<br>(d) Two-year period of authority
<br>
<br>Agreements may be entered into under this section only during the 2-year period which immediately follows the close of the period during which agreements may be entered into under section 2111 of this title.

<br>
<br>(1) withdraw, suspend, or modify the application of substantially equivalent trade agreement obligations of benefit to such foreign country or instrumentality, and

In the case of any article with respect to which consideration may be given to reducing or increasing the rate of duty, the list shall specify the provision of this subchapter under which such consideration may be given.
<br>
<br>(2) In connection with any proposed trade agreement under section 4202(b) of this title, the President may from time to time publish and furnish the Commission with lists of nontariff matters which may be considered for modification.

<br>Within 6 months after receipt of a list under subsection (a) or, in the case of a list submitted in connection with a trade agreement, within 90 days after receipt of such list, the Commission shall advise the President, with respect to each article or nontariff matter, of its judgment as to the probable economic effect of modification of the tariff or nontariff measure on industries producing like or directly competitive articles and on consumers, so as to assist the President in making an informed judgment as to the impact which might be caused by such modifications on United States interests, such as sectors involved in manufacturing, agriculture, mining, fishing, services, intellectual property, investment, labor, and consumers. Such advice may include in the case of any article the advice of the Commission as to whether any reduction in the rate of duty should take place over a longer period of time than the minimum period provided for in section 4202(a)(4)(A) of this title.
<br>(c) Additional investigations and reports requested by President or Trade Representative
<br>
<br>In addition, in order to assist the President in his determination whether to enter into any agreement under section 2133 of this title or section 4202(a) of this title, or how to develop trade policy, priorities or other matters (such as priorities for actions to improve opportunities in foreign markets), the Commission shall make such investigations and reports as may be requested by the President or the United States Trade Representative on matters such as effects of modification of any barrier to (or other distortion of) international trade on domestic workers, industries or sectors, purchasers, prices and quantities of articles in the United States.
<br>(d) Commission steps in preparing its advice to President
<br>
<br>In preparing its advice to the President under this section, the Commission shall to the extent practicable—
<br>
<br>(1) investigate conditions, causes, and effects relating to competition between the foreign industries producing the articles or services in question and the domestic industries producing the like or directly competitive articles or services;
<br>
<br>(2) analyze the production, trade, and consumption of each like or directly competitive article or service, taking into consideration employment, profit levels, and use of productive facilities with respect to the domestic industries concerned, and such other economic factors in such industries as it considers relevant, including prices, wages, sales, inventories, patterns of demand, capital investment, obsolescence of equipment, and diversification of production;
<br>
<br>(3) describe the probable nature and extent of any significant change in employment, profit levels, and use of productive facilities; the overall impact of such or other possible changes on the competitiveness of relevant domestic industries or sectors; and such other conditions as it deems relevant in the domestic industries or sectors concerned which it believes such modifications would cause; and
<br>
<br>(4) make special studies (including studies of real wages paid in foreign supplying countries), whenever deemed to be warranted, of particular proposed modifications affecting United States manufacturing, agriculture, mining, fishing, labor, consumers, services, intellectual property and investment, using to the fullest extent practicable United States Government facilities abroad and appropriate personnel of the United States.
