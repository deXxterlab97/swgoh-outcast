<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §408e (May 18, 1934, ch. 302, 48 Stat. 782; Aug. 2, 1946, ch. 735, 60 Stat. 789).
<br>
<br>Said section 408e was rewritten and the phrase "offenses as they are defined either at common law or by the laws of the place from which the fugitive flees" were inserted to remove the ambiguity discussed in the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals, Third Circuit, in Brandenburg v. U.S., decided September 6, 1944, not yet reported [144 F2d 656], reversing the conviction of the appellant. The court held that Congress intended the enumerated offenses to mean those as defined at common law. The effect of the rewritten section is to make the statute applicable whether the offense committed is one defined at common law or by the law of the state from which the fugitive flees.
<br>
<br>The words "offense punishable by imprisonment in a penitentiary" were substituted for "felony" to make the statute uniformly applicable and to include crimes of the grade of felony even where, as in New Jersey, they are denominated as misdemeanor, high misdemeanor or otherwise.
<br>
<br>Words "from any State, Territory, or possession of the United States or the District of Columbia" were omitted in view of definitive section 10 of this title.
<br>
<br>Words "upon conviction thereof" were deleted as surplusage since punishment cannot be imposed until a conviction is secured.
<br>
<br>Minor changes were made in phraseology.

<br>
<br>Any other murder is murder in the second degree.
<br>
<br>(b) Within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States,
<br>
<br>Whoever is guilty of murder in the first degree shall be punished by death or by imprisonment for life;
<br>
<br>Whoever is guilty of murder in the second degree, shall be imprisoned for any term of years or for life.

<br>
<br>(1) the term "assault" has the same meaning as given that term in section 113;
<br>
<br>(2) the term "child" means a person who has not attained the age of 18 years and is—
<br>
<br>(A) under the perpetrator's care or control; or

<br>

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§452, 454, 567 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §§273, 275, 330, 35 Stat. 1143, 1152).
<br>
<br>Section consolidates the punishment provision of sections 454 and 567 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with section 452 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed.
<br>
<br>The provision of said section 454 for the death penalty for first degree murder was consolidated with section 567 of said title 18, by adding the words "unless the jury qualifies its verdict by adding thereto 'without capital punishment' in which event he shall be sentenced to imprisonment for life".
<br>
<br>The punishment for second degree murder was changed and the phrase "for any term of years or for life" was substituted for the words "not less than ten years and may be imprisoned for life". This change conforms to a uniform policy of omitting the minimum punishment.
<br>
<br>Said section 567 was not included in section 2031 of this title since the rewritten punishment provision for rape removes the necessity for a qualified verdict.
<br>
<br>The special maritime and territorial jurisdiction provision was added in view of definitive section 7 of this title.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>1948 Act
<br>
<br>Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §253 (May 18, 1934, ch. 299, §1, 48 Stat. 780; Feb. 8, 1936, ch. 40, 49 Stat. 1105; June 26, 1936, ch. 830, title I, §3, 49 Stat. 1940; Reorg. Plan No. II, §4(f), eff. July 1, 1939, 4 F.R. 2731, 53 Stat. 1433; June 13, 1940, ch. 359, 54 Stat. 391).
<br>
<br>The section was extended to include United States judges, attorneys and their assistants, and officers of Federal, penal and correctional institutions in view of the obvious desirability of such protective legislation.
<br>
<br>Employees of the Bureau of Animal Industry have been included in this section to complete the revision of section 118 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which was consolidated with the assault provisions of section 254 of said title 18 and is now section 111 of this title. There seemed no sound reason for including such officers in the protection against assaults but excluding them from the homicide sections.
<br>
<br>For like reasons the section was broadened to include officers or employees of the Secret Service or of the Bureau of Narcotics.
<br>
<br>Changes in phraseology were made.
<br>1949 Act
<br>
<br>This section [section 24] amends section 1114 of title 18, U.S.C., to conform more closely with the original statute from which it was derived.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §461 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §282, 35 Stat. 1144).
<br>
<br>Section restores the intent of the original enactments, R.S. §5344, and act Mar. 3, 1905, ch. 1454, §5, 33 Stat. 1025, and makes this section one of general application. In the Criminal Code of 1909, by placing it in chapter 11, limited to places within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States, such original intent was inadvertently lost as indicated by the entire absence of report or comment on such limitation.
