<br>
<br>1 So in original. Probably should be "preceding".
<br>§2604. Manufacturing and processing notices
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>(1)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph and subsection (h), no person may—
<br>
<br>(i) manufacture a new chemical substance on or after the 30th day after the date on which the Administrator first publishes the list required by section 2607(b) of this title, or
<br>
<br>(ii) manufacture or process any chemical substance for a use which the Administrator has determined, in accordance with paragraph (2), is a significant new use.
<br>
<br>(B) A person may take the actions described in subparagraph (A) if—
<br>
<br>(i) such person submits to the Administrator, at least 90 days before such manufacture or processing, a notice, in accordance with subsection (d), of such person's intention to manufacture or process such substance and such person complies with any applicable requirement of, or imposed pursuant to, subsection (b), (e), or (f); and
<br>
<br>(ii) the Administrator—
<br>
<br>(I) conducts a review of the notice; and
<br>
<br>(II) makes a determination under subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of paragraph (3) and takes the actions required in association with that determination under such subparagraph within the applicable review period.
<br>
<br>(2) A determination by the Administrator that a use of a chemical substance is a significant new use with respect to which notification is required under paragraph (1) shall be made by a rule promulgated after a consideration of all relevant factors, including—
<br>
<br>(A) the projected volume of manufacturing and processing of a chemical substance,
<br>
<br>(B) the extent to which a use changes the type or form of exposure of human beings or the environment to a chemical substance,
<br>
<br>(C) the extent to which a use increases the magnitude and duration of exposure of human beings or the environment to a chemical substance, and
<br>
<br>(D) the reasonably anticipated manner and methods of manufacturing, processing, distribution in commerce, and disposal of a chemical substance.
<br>
<br>(3) Review and determination.—Within the applicable review period, subject to section 2617 of this title, the Administrator shall review such notice and determine—
<br>
<br>(A) that the relevant chemical substance or significant new use presents an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, without consideration of costs or other nonrisk factors, including an unreasonable risk to a potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulation identified as relevant by the Administrator under the conditions of use, in which case the Administrator shall take the actions required under subsection (f);
<br>
<br>(B) that—
<br>
<br>(i) the information available to the Administrator is insufficient to permit a reasoned evaluation of the health and environmental effects of the relevant chemical substance or significant new use; or
<br>
<br>(ii)(I) in the absence of sufficient information to permit the Administrator to make such an evaluation, the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of such substance, or any combination of such activities, may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, without consideration of costs or other nonrisk factors, including an unreasonable risk to a potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulation identified as relevant by the Administrator; or
<br>
<br>(II) such substance is or will be produced in substantial quantities, and such substance either enters or may reasonably be anticipated to enter the environment in substantial quantities or there is or may be significant or substantial human exposure to the substance,
<br>
<br>in which case the Administrator shall take the actions required under subsection (e); or
<br>
<br>(C) that the relevant chemical substance or significant new use is not likely to present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, without consideration of costs or other nonrisk factors, including an unreasonable risk to a potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulation identified as relevant by the Administrator under the conditions of use, in which case the submitter of the notice may commence manufacture of the chemical substance or manufacture or processing for a significant new use.
<br>
<br>(4) Failure to render determination.—
<br>
<br>(A) Failure to render determination.—If the Administrator fails to make a determination on a notice under paragraph (3) by the end of the applicable review period and the notice has not been withdrawn by the submitter, the Administrator shall refund to the submitter all applicable fees charged to the submitter for review of the notice pursuant to section 2625(b) of this title, and the Administrator shall not be relieved of any requirement to make such determination.
<br>
<br>(B) Limitations.—(i) A refund of applicable fees under subparagraph (A) shall not be made if the Administrator certifies that the submitter has not provided information required under subsection (b) or has otherwise unduly delayed the process such that the Administrator is unable to render a determination within the applicable review period.
<br>
<br>(ii) A failure of the Administrator to render a decision shall not be deemed to constitute a withdrawal of the notice.
<br>
<br>(iii) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as relieving the Administrator or the submitter of the notice from any requirement of this section.
<br>
<br>(5) Article consideration.—The Administrator may require notification under this section for the import or processing of a chemical substance as part of an article or category of articles under paragraph (1)(A)(ii) if the Administrator makes an affirmative finding in a rule under paragraph (2) that the reasonable potential for exposure to the chemical substance through the article or category of articles subject to the rule justifies notification.
<br>(b) Submission of information
<br>
<br>(1)(A) If (i) a person is required by subsection (a)(1) to submit a notice to the Administrator before beginning the manufacture or processing of a chemical substance, and (ii) such person is required to submit information for such substance pursuant to a rule, order, or consent agreement under section 2603 of this title before the submission of such notice, such person shall submit to the Administrator such information in accordance with such rule, order, or consent agreement at the time notice is submitted in accordance with subsection (a)(1).
<br>
<br>(B) If—
<br>
<br>(i) a person is required by subsection (a)(1) to submit a notice to the Administrator, and
<br>
<br>(ii) such person has been granted an exemption under section 2603(c) of this title from the requirements of a rule or order under section 2603 of this title before the submission of such notice,
<br>
<br>such person may not, before the expiration of the 90 day period which begins on the date of the submission in accordance with such rule of the information the submission or development of which was the basis for the exemption, manufacture such substance if such person is subject to subsection (a)(1)(A)(i) or manufacture or process such substance for a significant new use if the person is subject to subsection (a)(1)(A)(ii).
<br>
<br>(2)(A) If a person—
<br>
<br>(i) is required by subsection (a)(1) to submit a notice to the Administrator before beginning the manufacture or processing of a chemical substance listed under paragraph (4), and
<br>
<br>(ii) is not required by a rule, order, or consent agreement under section 2603 of this title before the submission of such notice to submit information for such substance,
<br>
<br>such person may submit to the Administrator information prescribed by subparagraph (B) at the time notice is submitted in accordance with subsection (a)(1).
<br>
<br>(B) Information submitted pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall be information which the person submitting the information believes shows that—
<br>
<br>(i) in the case of a substance with respect to which notice is required under subsection (a)(1)(A)(i), the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, and disposal of the chemical substance or any combination of such activities will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, or
<br>
<br>(ii) in the case of a chemical substance with respect to which notice is required under subsection (a)(1)(A)(ii), the intended significant new use of the chemical substance will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment.
<br>
<br>(3) Information submitted under paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection or under subsection (e) shall be made available, subject to section 2613 of this title, for examination by interested persons.
<br>
<br>(4)(A)(i) The Administrator may, by rule, compile and keep current a list of chemical substances with respect to which the Administrator finds that the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal, or any combination of such activities, presents or may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, without consideration of costs or other nonrisk factors.
<br>
<br>(ii) In making a finding under clause (i) that the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of a chemical substance or any combination of such activities presents or may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, the Administrator shall consider all relevant factors, including—
<br>
<br>(I) the effects of the chemical substance on health and the magnitude of human exposure to such substance; and
<br>
<br>(II) the effects of the chemical substance on the environment and the magnitude of environmental exposure to such substance.
<br>
<br>(B) The Administrator shall, in prescribing a rule under subparagraph (A) which lists any chemical substance, identify those uses, if any, which the Administrator determines, by rule under subsection (a)(2), would constitute a significant new use of such substance.
<br>
<br>(C) Any rule under subparagraph (A), and any substantive amendment or repeal of such a rule, shall be promulgated pursuant to the procedures specified in section 553 of title 5.
<br>(c) Extension of review period
<br>
<br>The Administrator may for good cause extend for additional periods (not to exceed in the aggregate 90 days) the period, prescribed by subsection (a) or (b). Subject to section 2613 of this title, such an extension and the reasons therefor shall be published in the Federal Register and shall constitute a final agency action subject to judicial review.
<br>(d) Content of notice; publications in the Federal Register
<br>
<br>(1) The notice required by subsection (a) shall include—
<br>
<br>(A) insofar as known to the person submitting the notice or insofar as reasonably ascertainable, the information described in subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), (D), (F), and (G) of section 2607(a)(2) of this title, and
<br>
<br>(B) in such form and manner as the Administrator may prescribe, any information in the possession or control of the person giving such notice which are related to the effect of any manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of such substance or any article containing such substance, or of any combination of such activities, on health or the environment, and
<br>
<br>(C) a description of any other information concerning the environmental and health effects of such substance, insofar as known to the person making the notice or insofar as reasonably ascertainable.
<br>
<br>Such a notice shall be made available, subject to section 2613 of this title, for examination by interested persons.
<br>
<br>(2) Subject to section 2613 of this title, not later than five days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays) after the date of the receipt of a notice under subsection (a) or of information under subsection (b), the Administrator shall publish in the Federal Register a notice which—
<br>
<br>(A) identifies the chemical substance for which notice or information has been received;
<br>
<br>(B) lists the uses of such substance identified in the notice; and
<br>
<br>(C) in the case of the receipt of information under subsection (b), describes the nature of the tests performed on such substance and any information which was developed pursuant to subsection (b) or a rule, order, or consent agreement under section 2603 of this title.
<br>
<br>A notice under this paragraph respecting a chemical substance shall identify the chemical substance by generic class unless the Administrator determines that more specific identification is required in the public interest.
<br>
<br>(3) At the beginning of each month the Administrator shall publish a list in the Federal Register of (A) each chemical substance for which notice has been received under subsection (a) and for which the applicable review period has not expired, and (B) each chemical substance for which such period has expired since the last publication in the Federal Register of such list.
<br>(e) Regulation pending development of information
<br>
<br>(1) 1 (A) If the Administrator determines that—
<br>
<br>(i) the information available to the Administrator is insufficient to permit a reasoned evaluation of the health and environmental effects of a chemical substance with respect to which notice is required by subsection (a); or
<br>
<br>(ii)(I) in the absence of sufficient information to permit the Administrator to make such an evaluation, the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of such substance, or any combination of such activities, may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, without consideration of costs or other nonrisk factors, including an unreasonable risk to a potentially exposed subpopulation identified as relevant by the Administrator under the conditions of use; or
<br>
<br>(II) such substance is or will be produced in substantial quantities, and such substance either enters or may reasonably be anticipated to enter the environment in substantial quantities or there is or may be significant or substantial human exposure to the substance,
<br>
<br>the Administrator shall issue an order, to take effect on the expiration of the applicable review period, to prohibit or limit the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of such substance or to prohibit or limit any combination of such activities to the extent necessary to protect against an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, without consideration of costs or other nonrisk factors, including an unreasonable risk to a potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulation identified as relevant by the Administrator under the conditions of use, and the submitter of the notice may commence manufacture of the chemical substance, or manufacture or processing of the chemical substance for a significant new use, including while any required information is being developed, only in compliance with the order.
<br>
<br>(B) An order may not be issued under subparagraph (A) respecting a chemical substance (i) later than 45 days before the expiration of the applicable review period, and (ii) unless the Administrator has, on or before the issuance of the order, notified, in writing, each manufacturer or processor, as the case may be, of such substance of the determination which underlies such order.
<br>(f) Protection against unreasonable risks
<br>
<br>(1) If the Administrator determines that a chemical substance or significant new use with respect to which notice is required by subsection (a) presents an unreasonable risk of injury to health or environment, without consideration of costs or other nonrisk factors, including an unreasonable risk to a potentially exposed subpopulation identified as relevant by the Administrator under the conditions of use, the Administrator shall, before the expiration of the applicable review period, take the action authorized by paragraph (2) or (3) to the extent necessary to protect against such risk.
<br>
<br>(2) The Administrator may issue a proposed rule under section 2605(a) of this title to apply to a chemical substance with respect to which a finding was made under paragraph (1)—
<br>
<br>(A) a requirement limiting the amount of such substance which may be manufactured, processed, or distributed in commerce,
<br>
<br>(B) a requirement described in paragraph (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), or (7) of section 2605(a) of this title, or
<br>
<br>(C) any combination of the requirements referred to in subparagraph (B).
<br>
<br>Such a proposed rule shall be effective upon its publication in the Federal Register. Section 2605(d)(3)(B) of this title shall apply with respect to such rule.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) The Administrator may issue an order to prohibit or limit the manufacture, processing, or distribution in commerce of a substance with respect to which a finding was made under paragraph (1). Such order shall take effect on the expiration of the applicable review period.
<br>
<br>(B) The provisions of subparagraph (B) of subsection (e)(1) shall apply with respect to an order issued under subparagraph (A).
<br>
<br>(4) Treatment of nonconforming uses.—Not later than 90 days after taking an action under paragraph (2) or (3) or issuing an order under subsection (e) relating to a chemical substance with respect to which the Administrator has made a determination under subsection (a)(3)(A) or (B), the Administrator shall consider whether to promulgate a rule pursuant to subsection (a)(2) that identifies as a significant new use any manufacturing, processing, use, distribution in commerce, or disposal of the chemical substance that does not conform to the restrictions imposed by the action or order, and, as applicable, initiate such a rulemaking or publish a statement describing the reasons of the Administrator for not initiating such a rulemaking.
<br>
<br>(5) Workplace exposures.—To the extent practicable, the Administrator shall consult with the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health prior to adopting any prohibition or other restriction relating to a chemical substance with respect to which the Administrator has made a determination under subsection (a)(3)(A) or (B) to address workplace exposures.
<br>(g) Statement on Administrator finding
<br>
<br>If the Administrator finds in accordance with subsection (a)(3)(C) that a chemical substance or significant new use is not likely to present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, then notwithstanding any remaining portion of the applicable review period, the submitter of the notice may commence manufacture of the chemical substance or manufacture or processing for the significant new use, and the Administrator shall make public a statement of the Administrator's finding. Such a statement shall be submitted for publication in the Federal Register as soon as is practicable before the expiration of such period. Publication of such statement in accordance with the preceding sentence is not a prerequisite to the manufacturing or processing of the substance with respect to which the statement is to be published.
<br>(h) Exemptions
<br>
<br>(1) The Administrator may, upon application, exempt any person from any requirement of subsection (a) or (b) to permit such person to manufacture or process a chemical substance for test marketing purposes—
<br>
<br>(A) upon a showing by such person satisfactory to the Administrator that the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, and disposal of such substance, and that any combination of such activities, for such purposes will not present any unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, including an unreasonable risk to a potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulation identified by the Administrator for the specific conditions of use identified in the application, and
<br>
<br>(B) under such restrictions as the Administrator considers appropriate.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) The Administrator may, upon application, exempt any person from the requirement of subsection (b)(2) to submit information for a chemical substance. If, upon receipt of an application under the preceding sentence, the Administrator determines that—
<br>
<br>(i) the chemical substance with respect to which such application was submitted is equivalent to a chemical substance for which information has been submitted to the Administrator as required by subsection (b)(2), and
<br>
<br>(ii) submission of information by the applicant on such substance would be duplicative of information which has been submitted to the Administrator in accordance with such subsection,
<br>
<br>the Administrator shall exempt the applicant from the requirement to submit such information on such substance. No exemption which is granted under this subparagraph with respect to the submission of information for a chemical substance may take effect before the beginning of the reimbursement period applicable to such information.
<br>
<br>(B) If the Administrator exempts any person, under subparagraph (A), from submitting information required under subsection (b)(2) for a chemical substance because of the existence of previously submitted information and if such exemption is granted during the reimbursement period for such information, then (unless such person and the persons referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) agree on the amount and method of reimbursement) the Administrator shall order the person granted the exemption to provide fair and equitable reimbursement (in an amount determined under rules of the Administrator)—
<br>
<br>(i) to the person who previously submitted the information on which the exemption was based, for a portion of the costs incurred by such person in complying with the requirement under subsection (b)(2) to submit such information, and
<br>
<br>(ii) to any other person who has been required under this subparagraph to contribute with respect to such costs, for a portion of the amount such person was required to contribute.
<br>
<br>In promulgating rules for the determination of fair and equitable reimbursement to the persons described in clauses (i) and (ii) for costs incurred with respect to a chemical substance, the Administrator shall, after consultation with the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission, consider all relevant factors, including the effect on the competitive position of the person required to provide reimbursement in relation to the persons to be reimbursed and the share of the market for such substance of the person required to provide reimbursement in relation to the share of such market of the persons to be reimbursed. For purposes of judicial review, an order under this subparagraph shall be considered final agency action.
<br>
<br>(C) For purposes of this paragraph, the reimbursement period for any previously submitted information for a chemical substance is a period—
<br>
<br>(i) beginning on the date of the termination of the prohibition, imposed under this section, on the manufacture or processing of such substance by the person who submitted such information to the Administrator, and
<br>
<br>(ii) ending—
<br>
<br>(I) five years after the date referred to in clause (i), or
<br>
<br>(II) at the expiration of a period which begins on the date referred to in clause (i) and is equal to the period which the Administrator determines was necessary to develop such information,
<br>
<br>whichever is later.
<br>
<br>(3) The requirements of subsections (a) and (b) do not apply with respect to the manufacturing or processing of any chemical substance which is manufactured or processed, or proposed to be manufactured or processed, only in small quantities (as defined by the Administrator by rule) solely for purposes of—
<br>
<br>(A) scientific experimentation or analysis, or
<br>
<br>(B) chemical research on, or analysis of such substance or another substance, including such research or analysis for the development of a product,
<br>
<br>if all persons engaged in such experimentation, research, or analysis for a manufacturer or processor are notified (in such form and manner as the Administrator may prescribe) of any risk to health which the manufacturer, processor, or the Administrator has reason to believe may be associated with such chemical substance.
<br>
<br>(4) The Administrator may, upon application and by rule, exempt the manufacturer of any new chemical substance from all or part of the requirements of this section if the Administrator determines that the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of such chemical substance, or that any combination of such activities, will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, including an unreasonable risk to a potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulation identified by the Administrator under the conditions of use.
<br>
<br>(5) The Administrator may, upon application, make the requirements of subsections (a) and (b) inapplicable with respect to the manufacturing or processing of any chemical substance (A) which exists temporarily as a result of a chemical reaction in the manufacturing or processing of a mixture or another chemical substance, and (B) to which there is no, and will not be, human or environmental exposure.
<br>
<br>(6) Immediately upon receipt of an application under paragraph (1) or (5) the Administrator shall publish in the Federal Register notice of the receipt of such application. The Administrator shall give interested persons an opportunity to comment upon any such application and shall, within 45 days of its receipt, either approve or deny the application. The Administrator shall publish in the Federal Register notice of the approval or denial of such an application.

<br>§2605. Prioritization, risk evaluation, and regulation of chemical substances and mixtures
<br>(a) Scope of regulation
<br>
<br>If the Administrator determines in accordance with subsection (b)(4)(A) that the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of a chemical substance or mixture, or that any combination of such activities, presents an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, the Administrator shall by rule and subject to section 2617 of this title, and in accordance with subsection (c)(2), apply one or more of the following requirements to such substance or mixture to the extent necessary so that the chemical substance or mixture no longer presents such risk:
<br>
<br>(1) A requirement (A) prohibiting or otherwise restricting the manufacturing, processing, or distribution in commerce of such substance or mixture, or (B) limiting the amount of such substance or mixture which may be manufactured, processed, or distributed in commerce.
<br>
<br>(2) A requirement—
<br>
<br>(A) prohibiting or otherwise restricting the manufacture, processing, or distribution in commerce of such substance or mixture for (i) a particular use or (ii) a particular use in a concentration in excess of a level specified by the Administrator in the rule imposing the requirement, or
<br>
<br>(B) limiting the amount of such substance or mixture which may be manufactured, processed, or distributed in commerce for (i) a particular use or (ii) a particular use in a concentration in excess of a level specified by the Administrator in the rule imposing the requirement.
<br>
<br>(3) A requirement that such substance or mixture or any article containing such substance or mixture be marked with or accompanied by clear and adequate minimum warnings and instructions with respect to its use, distribution in commerce, or disposal or with respect to any combination of such activities. The form and content of such minimum warnings and instructions shall be prescribed by the Administrator.
<br>
<br>(4) A requirement that manufacturers and processors of such substance or mixture make and retain records of the processes used to manufacture or process such substance or mixture or monitor or conduct tests which are reasonable and necessary to assure compliance with the requirements of any rule applicable under this subsection.
<br>
<br>(5) A requirement prohibiting or otherwise regulating any manner or method of commercial use of such substance or mixture.
<br>
<br>(6)(A) A requirement prohibiting or otherwise regulating any manner or method of disposal of such substance or mixture, or of any article containing such substance or mixture, by its manufacturer or processor or by any other person who uses, or disposes of, it for commercial purposes.
<br>
<br>(B) A requirement under subparagraph (A) may not require any person to take any action which would be in violation of any law or requirement of, or in effect for, a State or political subdivision, and shall require each person subject to it to notify each State and political subdivision in which a required disposal may occur of such disposal.
<br>
<br>(7) A requirement directing manufacturers or processors of such substance or mixture (A) to give notice of such determination to distributors in commerce of such substance or mixture and, to the extent reasonably ascertainable, to other persons in possession of such substance or mixture or exposed to such substance or mixture, (B) to give public notice of such determination, and (C) to replace or repurchase such substance or mixture as elected by the person to which the requirement is directed.
<br>
<br>Any requirement (or combination of requirements) imposed under this subsection may be limited in application to specified geographic areas.
<br>(b) Risk evaluations
<br>(1) Prioritization for risk evaluations
<br>(A) Establishment of process
<br>
<br>Not later than 1 year after June 22, 2016, the Administrator shall establish, by rule, a risk-based screening process, including criteria for designating chemical substances as high-priority substances for risk evaluations or low-priority substances for which risk evaluations are not warranted at the time. The process to designate the priority of chemical substances shall include a consideration of the hazard and exposure potential of a chemical substance or a category of chemical substances (including consideration of persistence and bioaccumulation, potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations and storage near significant sources of drinking water), the conditions of use or significant changes in the conditions of use of the chemical substance, and the volume or significant changes in the volume of the chemical substance manufactured or processed.
<br>(B) Identification of priorities for risk evaluation
<br>(i) High-priority substances
<br>
<br>The Administrator shall designate as a high-priority substance a chemical substance that the Administrator concludes, without consideration of costs or other nonrisk factors, may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment because of a potential hazard and a potential route of exposure under the conditions of use, including an unreasonable risk to a potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulation identified as relevant by the Administrator.
<br>(ii) Low-priority substances
<br>
<br>The Administrator shall designate a chemical substance as a low-priority substance if the Administrator concludes, based on information sufficient to establish, without consideration of costs or other nonrisk factors, that such substance does not meet the standard identified in clause (i) for designating a chemical substance a high-priority substance.
<br>(C) Information request and review and proposed and final prioritization designation
<br>
<br>The rulemaking required in subparagraph (A) shall ensure that the time required to make a priority designation of a chemical substance be no shorter than nine months and no longer than 1 year, and that the process for such designations includes—
<br>
<br>(i) a requirement that the Administrator request interested persons to submit relevant information on a chemical substance that the Administrator has initiated the prioritization process on, before proposing a priority designation for the chemical substance, and provide 90 days for such information to be provided;
<br>
<br>(ii) a requirement that the Administrator publish each proposed designation of a chemical substance as a high- or low-priority substance, along with an identification of the information, analysis, and basis used to make the proposed designations, and provide 90 days for public comment on each such proposed designation; and
<br>
<br>(iii) a process by which the Administrator may extend the deadline in clause (i) for up to three months in order to receive or evaluate information required to be submitted in accordance with section 2603(a)(2)(B) of this title, subject to the limitation that if the information available to the Administrator at the end of such an extension remains insufficient to enable the designation of the chemical substance as a low-priority substance, the Administrator shall designate the chemical substance as a high-priority substance.
<br>(2) Initial risk evaluations and subsequent designations of high- and low-priority substances
<br>(A) Initial risk evaluations
<br>
<br>Not later than 180 days after June 22, 2016, the Administrator shall ensure that risk evaluations are being conducted on 10 chemical substances drawn from the 2014 update of the TSCA Work Plan for Chemical Assessments and shall publish the list of such chemical substances during the 180 day period.
<br>(B) Additional risk evaluations
<br>
<br>Not later than three and one half years after June 22, 2016, the Administrator shall ensure that risk evaluations are being conducted on at least 20 high-priority substances and that at least 20 chemical substances have been designated as low-priority substances, subject to the limitation that at least 50 percent of all chemical substances on which risk evaluations are being conducted by the Administrator are drawn from the 2014 update of the TSCA Work Plan for Chemical Assessments.
<br>(C) Continuing designations and risk evaluations
<br>
<br>The Administrator shall continue to designate priority substances and conduct risk evaluations in accordance with this subsection at a pace consistent with the ability of the Administrator to complete risk evaluations in accordance with the deadlines under paragraph (4)(G).
<br>(D) Preference
<br>

<br>(D) Replacement parts
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>The Administrator shall exempt replacement parts for complex durable goods and complex consumer goods that are designed prior to the date of publication in the Federal Register of the rule under subsection (a), unless the Administrator finds that such replacement parts contribute significantly to the risk, identified in a risk evaluation conducted under subsection (b)(4)(A), to the general population or to an identified potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulation.
<br>(ii) Definitions
<br>
<br>In this subparagraph—
<br>
<br>(I) the term "complex consumer goods" means electronic or mechanical devices composed of multiple manufactured components, with an intended useful life of 3 or more years, where the product is typically not consumed, destroyed, or discarded after a single use, and the components of which would be impracticable to redesign or replace; and

<br>
<br>In selecting among prohibitions and other restrictions, the Administrator shall apply such prohibitions or other restrictions to an article or category of articles containing the chemical substance or mixture only to the extent necessary to address the identified risks from exposure to the chemical substance or mixture from the article or category of articles so that the substance or mixture does not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment identified in the risk evaluation conducted in accordance with subsection (b)(4)(A).
<br>(3) Procedures
<br>
<br>When prescribing a rule under subsection (a) the Administrator shall proceed in accordance with section 553 of title 5 (without regard to any reference in such section to sections 556 and 557 of such title), and shall also—
<br>
<br>(A) publish a notice of proposed rulemaking stating with particularity the reason for the proposed rule;
<br>
<br>(B) allow interested persons to submit written data, views, and arguments, and make all such submissions publicly available;

<br>
<br>(2) Variability.—As determined by the Administrator, the compliance dates established under paragraph (1) may vary for different affected persons.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) The Administrator may declare a proposed rule under subsection (a) to be effective, and compliance with the proposed requirements to be mandatory, upon publication in the Federal Register of the proposed rule and until the compliance dates applicable to such requirements in a final rule promulgated under section 2605(a) of this title or until the Administrator revokes such proposed rule, in accordance with subparagraph (B), if—
<br>
<br>(i) the Administrator determines that—
<br>
<br>(I) the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of the chemical substance or mixture subject to such proposed rule or any combination of such activities is likely to result in an unreasonable risk of serious or widespread injury to health or the environment before such effective date without consideration of costs or other non-risk factors; and
<br>
<br>(II) making such proposed rule so effective is necessary to protect the public interest; and
<br>
<br>(ii) in the case of a proposed rule to prohibit the manufacture, processing, or distribution of a chemical substance or mixture because of the risk determined under clause (i)(I), a court has in an action under section 2606 of this title granted relief with respect to such risk associated with such substance or mixture.
<br>
<br>Such a proposed rule which is made so effective shall not, for purposes of judicial review, be considered final agency action.
<br>
<br>(B) If the Administrator makes a proposed rule effective upon its publication in the Federal Register, the Administrator shall, as expeditiously as possible, give interested persons prompt notice of such action in accordance with subsection (c), and either promulgate such rule (as proposed or with modifications) or revoke it.

<br>
<br>The Administrator may, as part of a rule promulgated under subsection (a), or in a separate rule, grant an exemption from a requirement of a subsection (a) rule for a specific condition of use of a chemical substance or mixture, if the Administrator finds that—
<br>
<br>(A) the specific condition of use is a critical or essential use for which no technically and economically feasible safer alternative is available, taking into consideration hazard and exposure;
<br>
<br>(B) compliance with the requirement, as applied with respect to the specific condition of use, would significantly disrupt the national economy, national security, or critical infrastructure; or
<br>
<br>(C) the specific condition of use of the chemical substance or mixture, as compared to reasonably available alternatives, provides a substantial benefit to health, the environment, or public safety.
<br>(2) Exemption analysis and statement
<br>
<br>In proposing an exemption under this subsection, the Administrator shall analyze the need for the exemption, and shall make public the analysis and a statement describing how the analysis was taken into account.
<br>(3) Period of exemption
<br>
<br>The Administrator shall establish, as part of a rule under this subsection, a time limit on any exemption for a time to be determined by the Administrator as reasonable on a case-by-case basis, and, by rule, may extend, modify, or eliminate an exemption if the Administrator determines, on the basis of reasonably available information and after adequate public justification, the exemption warrants extension or modification or is no longer necessary.
<br>(4) Conditions
<br>
<br>As part of a rule promulgated under this subsection, the Administrator shall include conditions, including reasonable recordkeeping, monitoring, and reporting requirements, to the extent that the Administrator determines the conditions are necessary to protect health and the environment while achieving the purposes of the exemption.

<br>§2606. Imminent hazards
<br>(a) Actions authorized and required
<br>
<br>(1) The Administrator may commence a civil action in an appropriate district court of the United States—
<br>
<br>(A) for seizure of an imminently hazardous chemical substance or mixture or any article containing such a substance or mixture,
<br>
<br>(B) for relief (as authorized by subsection (b)) against any person who manufactures, processes, distributes in commerce, or uses, or disposes of, an imminently hazardous chemical substance or mixture or any article containing such a substance or mixture, or
<br>
<br>(C) for both such seizure and relief.
<br>
<br>A civil action may be commenced under this paragraph notwithstanding the existence of a determination under section 2604 or 2605 of this title, a rule under section 2603, 2604, or 2605 of this title or subchapter IV, an order under section 2603, 2604, or 2605 of this title or subchapter IV, or a consent agreement under section 2603 of this title, and notwithstanding the pendency of any administrative or judicial proceeding under any provision of this chapter.
<br>
<br>(2) If the Administrator has not made a rule under section 2605(a) of this title immediately effective (as authorized by section 2605(d)(3)(A)(i) of this title) with respect to an imminently hazardous chemical substance or mixture, the Administrator shall commence in a district court of the United States with respect to such substance or mixture or article containing such substance or mixture a civil action described in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of paragraph (1).
<br>(b) Relief authorized
<br>
<br>(1) The district court of the United States in which an action under subsection (a) is brought shall have jurisdiction to grant such temporary or permanent relief as may be necessary to protect health or the environment from the unreasonable risk (as identified by the Administrator without consideration of costs or other nonrisk factors) associated with the chemical substance, mixture, or article involved in such action.
<br>
<br>(2) In the case of an action under subsection (a) brought against a person who manufactures, processes, or distributes in commerce a chemical substance or mixture or an article containing a chemical substance or mixture, the relief authorized by paragraph (1) may include the issuance of a mandatory order requiring (A) in the case of purchasers of such substance, mixture, or article known to the defendant, notification to such purchasers of the risk associated with it; (B) public notice of such risk; (C) recall; (D) the replacement or repurchase of such substance, mixture, or article; or (E) any combination of the actions described in the preceding clauses.
<br>
<br>(3) In the case of an action under subsection (a) against a chemical substance, mixture, or article, such substance, mixture, or article may be proceeded against by process of libel for its seizure and condemnation. Proceedings in such an action shall conform as nearly as possible to proceedings in rem in admiralty.
<br>(c) Venue and consolidation
<br>
<br>(1)(A) An action under subsection (a) against a person who manufactures, processes, or distributes a chemical substance or mixture or an article containing a chemical substance or mixture may be brought in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or for any judicial district in which any of the defendants is found, resides, or transacts business; and process in such an action may be served on a defendant in any other district in which such defendant resides or may be found. An action under subsection (a) against a chemical substance, mixture, or article may be brought in any United States district court within the jurisdiction of which the substance, mixture, or article is found.
<br>
<br>(B) In determining the judicial district in which an action may be brought under subsection (a) in instances in which such action may be brought in more than one judicial district, the Administrator shall take into account the convenience of the parties.
<br>
<br>(C) Subpeonas 1 requiring attendance of witnesses in an action brought under subsection (a) may be served in any judicial district.
<br>
<br>(2) Whenever proceedings under subsection (a) involving identical chemical substances, mixtures, or articles are pending in courts in two or more judicial districts, they shall be consolidated for trial by order of any such court upon application reasonably made by any party in interest, upon notice to all parties in interest.
<br>(d) Action under section 2605
<br>
<br>Where appropriate, concurrently with the filing of an action under subsection (a) or as soon thereafter as may be practicable, the Administrator shall initiate a proceeding for the promulgation of a rule under section 2605(a) of this title.
<br>(e) Representation
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in any action under subsection (a), the Administrator may direct attorneys of the Environmental Protection Agency to appear and represent the Administrator in such an action.
<br>(f) "Imminently hazardous chemical substance or mixture" defined
<br>
<br>For the purposes of subsection (a), the term "imminently hazardous chemical substance or mixture" means a chemical substance or mixture which presents an imminent and unreasonable risk of serious or widespread injury to health or the environment, without consideration of costs or other nonrisk factors. Such a risk to health or the environment shall be considered imminent if it is shown that the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of the chemical substance or mixture, or that any combination of such activities, is likely to result in such injury to health or the environment before a final rule under section 2605 of this title can protect against such risk.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 94–469, title I, §7, Oct. 11, 1976, 90 Stat. 2026; renumbered title I, Pub. L. 99–519, §3(c)(1), Oct. 22, 1986, 100 Stat. 2989; amended Pub. L. 102–550, title X, §1021(b)(1), Oct. 28, 1992, 106 Stat. 3923; Pub. L. 114–182, title I, §§7, 19(f), June 22, 2016, 130 Stat. 470, 507.)
<br>Amendments
<br>
<br>2016—Subsec. (a)(1). Pub. L. 114–182, §19(f)(1), in concluding provisions, substituted "a determination under section 2604 or 2605 of this title, a rule under section 2603, 2604, or 2605 of this title or subchapter IV, an order under section 2603, 2604, or 2605 of this title or subchapter IV, or a consent agreement under section 2603 of this title" for "a rule under section 2603 of this title, 2604 of this title, 2605 of this title, or subchapter IV or an order under section 2604 of this title or subchapter IV".
<br>
<br>Subsec. (a)(2). Pub. L. 114–182, §19(f)(2), substituted "section 2605(d)(3)(A)(i)" for "section 2605(d)(2)(A)(i)".
<br>
<br>Subsec. (b)(1). Pub. L. 114–182, §7(1), inserted "(as identified by the Administrator without consideration of costs or other nonrisk factors)" after "from the unreasonable risk".
<br>
<br>Subsec. (f). Pub. L. 114–182, §7(2), inserted ", without consideration of costs or other nonrisk factors" after "widespread injury to health or the environment".
<br>
<br>1992—Subsec. (a)(1). Pub. L. 102–550 substituted "section 2603 of this title, 2604 of this title, 2605 of this title, or subchapter IV" for "section 2603, 2604, or 2605 of this title" in last sentence.
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 102–550, which directed the insertion of "or subchapter IV" after "2604", was executed by making the insertion after "2604" the second time appearing in last sentence, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.

<br>§2607. Reporting and retention of information
<br>(a) Reports
<br>
<br>(1) The Administrator shall promulgate rules under which—
<br>
<br>(A) each person (other than a small manufacturer or processor) who manufactures or processes or proposes to manufacture or process a chemical substance (other than a chemical substance described in subparagraph (B)(ii)) shall maintain such records, and shall submit to the Administrator such reports, as the Administrator may reasonably require, and
<br>
<br>(B) each person (other than a small manufacturer or processor) who manufactures or processes or proposes to manufacture or process—
<br>
<br>(i) a mixture, or
<br>
<br>(ii) a chemical substance in small quantities (as defined by the Administrator by rule) solely for purposes of scientific experimentation or analysis or chemical research on, or analysis of, such substance or another substance, including any such research or analysis for the development of a product,
<br>
<br>shall maintain records and submit to the Administrator reports but only to the extent the Administrator determines the maintenance of records or submission of reports, or both, is necessary for the effective enforcement of this chapter.
<br>
<br>The Administrator may not require in a rule promulgated under this paragraph the maintenance of records or the submission of reports with respect to changes in the proportions of the components of a mixture unless the Administrator finds that the maintenance of such records or the submission of such reports, or both, is necessary for the effective enforcement of this chapter. For purposes of the compilation of the list of chemical substances required under subsection (b), the Administrator shall promulgate rules pursuant to this subsection not later than 180 days after January 1, 1977.
<br>
<br>(2) The Administrator may require under paragraph (1) maintenance of records and reporting with respect to the following insofar as known to the person making the report or insofar as reasonably ascertainable:
<br>
<br>(A) The common or trade name, the chemical identity, and the molecular structure of each chemical substance or mixture for which such a report is required.
<br>
<br>(B) The categories or proposed categories of use of each such substance or mixture.
<br>
<br>(C) The total amount of each such substance and mixture manufactured or processed, reasonable estimates of the total amount to be manufactured or processed, the amount manufactured or processed for each of its categories of use, and reasonable estimates of the amount to be manufactured or processed for each of its categories of use or proposed categories of use.
<br>
<br>(D) A description of the byproducts resulting from the manufacture, processing, use, or disposal of each such substance or mixture.
<br>
<br>(E) All existing information concerning the environmental and health effects of such substance or mixture.
<br>
<br>(F) The number of individuals exposed, and reasonable estimates of the number who will be exposed, to such substance or mixture in their places of employment and the duration of such exposure.
<br>
<br>(G) In the initial report under paragraph (1) on such substance or mixture, the manner or method of its disposal, and in any subsequent report on such substance or mixture, any change in such manner or method.
<br>
<br>(3)(A)(i) The Administrator may by rule require a small manufacturer or processor of a chemical substance to submit to the Administrator such information respecting the chemical substance as the Administrator may require for publication of the first list of chemical substances required by subsection (b).
<br>
<br>(ii) The Administrator may by rule require a small manufacturer or processor of a chemical substance or mixture—
<br>
<br>(I) subject to a rule proposed or promulgated under section 2603, 2604(b)(4), or 2605 of this title,,1 an order in effect under section 2603 or 2604(e) of this title, or a consent agreement under section 2603 of this title, or
<br>
<br>(II) with respect to which relief has been granted pursuant to a civil action brought under section 2604 or 2606 of this title,
<br>
<br>to maintain such records on such substance or mixture, and to submit to the Administrator such reports on such substance or mixture, as the Administrator may reasonably require. A rule under this clause requiring reporting may require reporting with respect to the matters referred to in paragraph (2).
<br>
<br>(B) The Administrator, after consultation with the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, shall by rule prescribe standards for determining the manufacturers and processors which qualify as small manufacturers and processors for purposes of this paragraph and paragraph (1).
<br>
<br>(C) Not later than 180 days after June 22, 2016, and not less frequently than once every 10 years thereafter, the Administrator, after consultation with the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, shall—
<br>
<br>(i) review the adequacy of the standards prescribed under subparagraph (B); and
<br>
<br>(ii) after providing public notice and an opportunity for comment, make a determination as to whether revision of the standards is warranted.
<br>
<br>(4) Contents.—The rules promulgated pursuant to paragraph (1)—
<br>
<br>(A) may impose differing reporting and recordkeeping requirements on manufacturers and processors; and
<br>
<br>(B) shall include the level of detail necessary to be reported, including the manner by which use and exposure information may be reported.
<br>
<br>(5) Administration.—In carrying out this section, the Administrator shall, to the extent feasible—
<br>

<br>(b) Inventory
<br>
<br>(1) The Administrator shall compile, keep current, and publish a list of each chemical substance which is manufactured or processed in the United States. Such list shall at least include each chemical substance which any person reports, under section 2604 of this title or subsection (a) of this section, is manufactured or processed in the United States. Such list may not include any chemical substance which was not manufactured or processed in the United States within three years before the effective date of the rules promulgated pursuant to the last sentence of subsection (a)(1). In the case of a chemical substance for which a notice is submitted in accordance with section 2604 of this title, such chemical substance shall be included in such list as of the earliest date (as determined by the Administrator) on which such substance was manufactured or processed in the United States. The Administrator shall first publish such a list not later than 315 days after January 1, 1977. The Administrator shall not include in such list any chemical substance which is manufactured or processed only in small quantities (as defined by the Administrator by rule) solely for purposes of scientific experimentation or analysis or chemical research on, or analysis of, such substance or another substance, including such research or analysis for the development of a product.
<br>
<br>(2) To the extent consistent with the purposes of this chapter, the Administrator may, in lieu of listing, pursuant to paragraph (1), a chemical substance individually, list a category of chemical substances in which such substance is included.
<br>
<br>(3) Nomenclature.—

<br>
<br>(B) Confidential chemical substances.—In promulgating a rule under subparagraph (A), the Administrator shall—
<br>
<br>(i) maintain the list under paragraph (1), which shall include a confidential portion and a nonconfidential portion consistent with this section and section 2613 of this title;
<br>
<br>(ii) require any manufacturer or processor of a chemical substance on the confidential portion of the list published under paragraph (1) that seeks to maintain an existing claim for protection against disclosure of the specific chemical identity of the chemical substance as confidential pursuant to section 2613 of this title to submit a notice under subparagraph (A) that includes such request;
<br>
<br>(iii) require the substantiation of those claims pursuant to section 2613 of this title and in accordance with the review plan described in subparagraph (C); and
<br>
<br>(iv) move any active chemical substance for which no request was received to maintain an existing claim for protection against disclosure of the specific chemical identity of the chemical substance as confidential from the confidential portion of the list published under paragraph (1) to the nonconfidential portion of that list.
<br>
<br>(C) Review plan.—Not later than 1 year after the date on which the Administrator compiles the initial list of active substances pursuant to subparagraph (A), the Administrator shall promulgate a rule that establishes a plan to review all claims to protect the specific chemical identities of chemical substances on the confidential portion of the list published under paragraph (1) that are asserted pursuant to subparagraph (B).

<br>(ii) in accordance with section 2613 of this title—
<br>
<br>(I) review each substantiation—
<br>
<br>(aa) submitted pursuant to clause (i) to determine if the claim qualifies for protection from disclosure; and
<br>
<br>(bb) submitted previously by a manufacturer or processor and relied on in lieu of the substantiation required pursuant to clause (i), if the substantiation has not been previously reviewed by the Administrator, to determine if the claim warrants protection from disclosure;
<br>
<br>(II) approve, approve in part and deny in part, or deny each claim; and
<br>
<br>(III) except as provided in this section and section 2613 of this title, protect from disclosure information for which the Administrator approves such a claim for a period of 10 years, unless, prior to the expiration of the period—
<br>
<br>(aa) the person notifies the Administrator that the person is withdrawing the claim, in which case the Administrator shall not protect the information from disclosure; or
<br>
<br>(bb) the Administrator otherwise becomes aware that the information does not qualify for protection from disclosure, in which case the Administrator shall take the actions described in section 2613(g)(2) of this title.
