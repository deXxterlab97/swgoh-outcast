<br>In paragraph (1), the words "when used in a geographical sense" are added for clarity.

<br>In paragraph (2), the words "an employee as defined by section 2105 of this title" are coextensive with and substituted for "civilian officers and employees of the United States . . . including officers and employees of corporations wholly owned or controlled by the United States". Specific reference to officers and members of the Metropolitan Police force of the District of Columbia, the Fire Department of the District of Columbia, the United States Park Police force, and the White House Police force, as set forth in former section 2067, is omitted as unnecessary in view of the provisions of paragraph (2)(A), (B). The exception for "commissioned officers of the Public Health Service" and "commissioned officers of the Coast and Geodetic Survey" in former section 2061(b)(1)(E), (F) is omitted as unnecessary since these officers are excluded by the definition of the word "employee" in section 2105.
<br>
<br>In paragraph (2)(ix), the words "as defined by section 901 of title 20" are added on authority of former section 2351, which section is scheduled for transfer to section 901 of title 20.

<br>

<br>§6303. Annual leave; accrual
<br>
<br>(a) An employee is entitled to annual leave with pay which accrues as follows—
<br>
<br>(1) one-half day for each full biweekly pay period for an employee with less than 3 years of service;
<br>
<br>(2) three-fourths day for each full biweekly pay period, except that the accrual for the last full biweekly pay period in the year is one and one-fourth days, for an employee with 3 but less than 15 years of service; and
<br>
<br>(3) one day for each full biweekly pay period for an employee with 15 or more years of service.
<br>
<br>In determining years of service, an employee is entitled to credit for all service of a type that would be creditable under section 8332, regardless of whether or not the employee is covered by subchapter III of chapter 83, and for all service which is creditable by virtue of subsection (e). However, an employee who is a retired member of a uniformed service as defined by section 3501 of this title is entitled to credit for active military service only if—
<br>
<br>(A) his retirement was based on disability—
<br>
<br>(i) resulting from injury or disease received in line of duty as a direct result of armed conflict; or
<br>
<br>(ii) caused by an instrumentality of war and incurred in line of duty during a period of war as defined by sections 101 and 1101 of title 38;
<br>
<br>(B) that service was performed in the armed forces during a war, or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized; or
<br>
<br>(C) on November 30, 1964, he was employed in a position to which this subchapter applies and thereafter he continued to be so employed without a break in service of more than 30 days.
<br>
<br>The determination of years of service may be made on the basis of an affidavit of the employee. Leave provided by this subchapter accrues to an employee who is not paid on the basis of biweekly pay periods on the same basis as it would accrue if the employee were paid on the basis of biweekly pay periods.
<br>
<br>(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, an employee whose current employment is limited to less than 90 days is entitled to annual leave under this subchapter only after being currently employed for a continuous period of 90 days under successive appointments without a break in service. After completing the 90-day period, the employee is entitled to be credited with the leave that would have accrued to him under subsection (a) of this section except for this subsection.
<br>
<br>(c) A change in the rate of accrual of annual leave by an employee under this section takes effect at the beginning of the pay period after the pay period, or corresponding period for an employee who is not paid on the basis of biweekly pay periods, in which the employee completed the prescribed period of service.
<br>

<br>
<br>(a) Except as provided by subsections (b), (d), (e), (f), and (g) of this section, annual leave provided by section 6303 of this title, which is not used by an employee, accumulates for use in succeeding years until it totals not more than 30 days at the beginning of the first full biweekly pay period, or corresponding period for an employee who is not paid on the basis of biweekly pay periods, occurring in a year.
<br>
<br>(b) Annual leave not used by an employee of the Government of the United States in one of the following classes of employees stationed outside the United States accumulates for use in succeeding years until it totals not more than 45 days at the beginning of the first full biweekly pay period, or corresponding period for an employee who is not paid on the basis of biweekly pay periods, occurring in a year:
<br>
<br>(1) Individuals directly recruited or transferred by the Government of the United States from the United States or its territories or possessions including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico for employment outside the area of recruitment or from which transferred.
<br>
<br>(2) Individuals employed locally but—
<br>
<br>(A)(i) who were originally recruited from the United States or its territories or possessions including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico but outside the area of employment;
<br>
<br>(ii) who have been in substantially continuous employment by other agencies of the United States, United States firms, interests, or organizations, international organizations in which the United States participates, or foreign governments; and
<br>
<br>(iii) whose conditions of employment provide for their return transportation to the United States or its territories or possessions including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; or
<br>
<br>(B)(i) who were at the time of employment temporarily absent, for the purpose of travel or formal study, from the United States, or from their respective places of residence in its territories or possessions including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; and
<br>
<br>(ii) who, during the temporary absence, have maintained residence in the United States or its territories or possessions including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico but outside the area of employment.
<br>
<br>(3) Individuals who are not normally residents of the area concerned and who are discharged from service in the armed forces to accept employment with an agency of the Government of the United States.
<br>
<br>(c) Annual leave in excess of the amount allowable—
<br>
<br>(1) under subsection (a) or (b) of this section which was accumulated under earlier statute; or
<br>
<br>(2) under subsection (a) of this section which was accumulated under subsection (b) of this section by an employee who becomes subject to subsection (a) of this section;
<br>
<br>remains to the credit of the employee until used. The excess annual leave is reduced at the beginning of the first full biweekly pay period, or corresponding period for an employee who is not paid on the basis of biweekly pay periods, occurring in a year, by the amount of annual leave the employee used during the preceding year in excess of the amount which accrued during that year, until the employee's accumulated leave does not exceed the amount allowed under subsection (a) or (b) of this section, as appropriate.
<br>
<br>(d)(1) Annual leave which is lost by operation of this section because of—
<br>
<br>(A) administrative error when the error causes a loss of annual leave otherwise accruable after June 30, 1960;
<br>
<br>(B) exigencies of the public business when the annual leave was scheduled in advance; or
<br>
<br>(C) sickness of the employee when the annual leave was scheduled in advance;
<br>
<br>shall be restored to the employee.
<br>
<br>(2) Annual leave restored under paragraph (1) of this subsection, or under clause (2) of section 5562(a) of this title, which is in excess of the maximum leave accumulation permitted by law shall be credited to a separate leave account for the employee and shall be available for use by the employee within the time limits prescribed by regulations of the Office of Personnel Management. Leave credited under this paragraph but unused and still available to the employee under the regulations prescribed by the Office shall be included in the lump-sum payment under section 5551 or 5552(1) of this title but may not be retained to the credit of the employee under section 5552(2) of this title.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) For the purpose of this subsection, the closure of, and any realignment with respect to, an installation of the Department of Defense pursuant to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (part A of title XXIX of Public Law 101–510; 10 U.S.C. 2687 note) during any period, the closure of an installation of the Department of Defense in the Republic of Panama in accordance with the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977, and the closure of any other installation of the Department of Defense, during the period beginning on October 1, 1992, and ending on December 31, 1997, shall be deemed to create an exigency of the public business and any leave that is lost by an employee of such installation by operation of this section (regardless of whether such leave was scheduled) shall be restored to the employee and shall be credited and available in accordance with paragraph (2).
<br>
<br>(B) For the purpose of subparagraph (A), the term "realignment" means a base realignment (as defined in subsection (e)(3) of section 2687 of title 10) that meets the requirements of subsection (a)(2) of such section.
<br>
<br>(4)(A) For the purpose of this subsection, service of a Department of Defense emergency essential employee in a combat zone is an exigency of the public business for that employee. Any leave that, by reason of such service, is lost by the employee by operation of this section (regardless of whether such leave was scheduled) shall be restored to the employee and shall be credited and available in accordance with paragraph (2).
<br>
<br>(B) As used in subparagraph (A)—
<br>
<br>(i) the term "Department of Defense emergency essential employee" means an employee of the Department of Defense who is designated under section 1580 of title 10 as an emergency essential employee; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the term "combat zone" has the meaning given such term in section 112(c)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
<br>
<br>(e) Annual leave otherwise accruable after June 30, 1960, which is lost by operation of this section because of administrative error and which is not credited under subsection (d)(2) of this section because the employee is separated before the error is discovered, is subject to credit and liquidation by lump-sum payment only if a claim therefor is filed within 3 years immediately following the date of discovery of the error. Payment shall be made by the agency of employment when the lump-sum payment provisions of section 5551 of this title last became applicable to the employee at the rate of basic pay in effect on the date the lump-sum provisions became applicable.
<br>
<br>(f)(1) This subsection applies with respect to annual leave accrued by an individual while serving in—
<br>
<br>(A) a position in the Senior Executive Service;
<br>
<br>(B) a position in the Senior Foreign Service;
<br>
<br>(C) a position in the Defense Intelligence Senior Executive Service;
<br>
<br>(D) a position in the Senior Cryptologic Executive Service;
<br>
<br>(E) a position in the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Drug Enforcement Administration Senior Executive Service;
<br>
<br>(F) a position to which section 5376 applies;
<br>
<br>(G) a position designated under section 1607(a) of title 10 as an Intelligence Senior Level position; or
<br>
<br>(H) 1 a position in the Library of Congress the compensation for which is set at a rate equal to the annual rate of basic pay payable for positions at level III of the Executive Schedule under section 5314.
<br>
<br>(H) 1 a position in the United States Secret Service Uniformed Division at the rank of Deputy Chief, Assistant Chief, or Chief.
<br>
<br>(2) For purposes of applying any limitation on accumulation under this section with respect to any annual leave described in paragraph (1)—
<br>
<br>(A) "30 days" in subsection (a) shall be deemed to read "90 days"; and
<br>
<br>(B) "45 days" in subsection (b) shall be deemed to read "90 days".

<br>
<br>(A) to give care or otherwise attend to a family member having an illness, injury, or other condition which, if an employee had such condition, would justify the use of sick leave by such an employee; or

<br>
<br>"(i) within 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act [September 30, 1994] or such later date as the Office may prescribe;

Leave under this subsection accrues for an employee or individual at the rate of 15 days per fiscal year and, to the extent that it is not used in a fiscal year, accumulates for use in the succeeding fiscal year until it totals 15 days at the beginning of a fiscal year.
<br>
<br>(2) In the case of an employee or individual employed on a part-time career employment basis (as defined in section 3401(2) of this title), the rate at which leave accrues under this subsection shall be a percentage of the rate prescribed under paragraph (1) which is determined by dividing 40 into the number of hours in the regularly scheduled workweek of that employee or individual during that fiscal year.
<br>
<br>(3) The minimum charge for leave under this subsection is one hour, and additional charges are in multiples thereof.
<br>
<br>(b) Except as provided by section 5519 of this title, an employee as defined by section 2105 of this title or an individual employed by the government of the District of Columbia, permanent or temporary indefinite, who—

Leave granted by this subsection shall not exceed 22 workdays in a calendar year.

The period of absence may not be charged to sick leave.
<br>
<br>(c) An employee as defined by section 2105 of this title or an individual employed by the government of the District of Columbia, who is a member of the National Guard of the District of Columbia, is entitled to leave without loss in pay or time for each day of a parade or encampment ordered or authorized under title 39, District of Columbia Code.
