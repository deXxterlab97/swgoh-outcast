<br>
<br>This section may be cited as the "National Security Agency Voluntary Separation Act".
<br>(b) Definitions
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section—
<br>
<br>(1) the term "Director" means the Director of the National Security Agency; and
<br>
<br>(2) the term "employee" means an employee of the National Security Agency, serving under an appointment without time limitation, who has been currently employed by the National Security Agency for a continuous period of at least 12 months prior to the effective date of the program established under subsection (c), except that such term does not include—
<br>

<br>
<br>(B) an employee having a disability on the basis of which such employee is or would be eligible for disability retirement under any of the retirement systems referred to in subparagraph (A).
<br>(c) Establishment of program
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Director, in his sole discretion, may establish a program under which employees may, after October 1, 2000, be eligible for early retirement, offered separation pay to separate from service voluntarily, or both.
<br>(d) Early retirement
<br>
<br>An employee who—
<br>
<br>(1) is at least 50 years of age and has completed 20 years of service; or
<br>
<br>(2) has at least 25 years of service,
<br>
<br>may, pursuant to regulations promulgated under this section, apply and be retired from the National Security Agency and receive benefits in accordance with chapter 83 or 84 of title 5 if the employee has not less than 10 years of service with the National Security Agency.
<br>(e) Amount of separation pay and treatment for other purposes
<br>(1) Amount
<br>
<br>Separation pay shall be paid in a lump sum and shall be equal to the lesser of—

<br>
<br>(B) $25,000.

<br>
<br>Separation pay shall not—
<br>
<br>(A) be a basis for payment, and shall not be included in the computation, of any other type of Government benefit; and
<br>
<br>(B) be taken into account for the purpose of determining the amount of any severance pay to which an individual may be entitled under section 5595 of title 5 based on any other separation.
<br>(f) Reemployment restrictions
<br>
<br>An employee who receives separation pay under such program may not be reemployed by the National Security Agency for the 12-month period beginning on the effective date of the employee's separation. An employee who receives separation pay under this section on the basis of a separation occurring on or after March 30, 1994, and accepts employment with the Government of the United States within 5 years after the date of the separation on which payment of the separation pay is based shall be required to repay the entire amount of the separation pay to the National Security Agency. If the employment is with an Executive agency (as defined by section 105 of title 5), the Director of the Office of Personnel Management may, at the request of the head of the agency, waive the repayment if the individual involved possesses unique abilities and is the only qualified applicant available for the position. If the employment is with an entity in the legislative branch, the head of the entity or the appointing official may waive the repayment if the individual involved possesses unique abilities and is the only qualified applicant available for the position. If the employment is with the judicial branch, the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts may waive the repayment if the individual involved possesses unique abilities and is the only qualified applicant available for the position.
<br>(g) Bar on certain employment

<br>
<br>(B) participate in any manner in the award, modification, or extension of any contract for property or services with the National Security Agency,
<br>
<br>during the 12-month period beginning on the effective date of the employee's separation from service.
<br>(2) Penalty
<br>
<br>An employee who violates an agreement under this subsection shall be liable to the United States in the amount of the separation pay paid to the employee pursuant to this section multiplied by the proportion of the 12-month period during which the employee was in violation of the agreement.
<br>(h) Limitations
<br>
<br>Under this program, early retirement and separation pay may be offered only—
<br>
<br>(1) with the prior approval of the Director;

<br>
<br>(3) to employees within such occupational groups or geographic locations, or subject to such other similar limitations or conditions, as the Director may require.

<br>This title, referred to in text, meant, when enacted, title IV of act July 26, 1947, ch. 343, which was added by section 11 of act Aug. 10, 1949, ch. 412, 63 Stat. 585, and which consisted of sections 401 to 411, this section being section 411. Section 11 of act Aug. 10, 1949—except for "§411"—was repealed by Pub. L. 87–651, §307, Sept. 7, 1962, 76 Stat. 526. Although that repeal was executed by repealing title IV of act July 26, 1947 (except for this section), and the subsequent renumbering of section 411 of that Act as section 312 suggests that this section is now within title III, it is unclear whether the reference to "this title" should now be interpreted as referring to title III (classified to this subchapter) or whether it continues to refer to the now eliminated title IV. See Codification note below.
<br>Codification
<br>
<br>When originally enacted, this section was section 411 of title IV of the National Security Act of 1947, act July 26, 1947, ch. 343 ("the Act"). Title IV of the Act, consisting of sections 401 to 411, was added by section 11 of act Aug. 10, 1949, ch. 412, 63 Stat. 585. Provisions of title IV of the Act were restated by Pub. L. 87–651, Sept. 7, 1962, 76 Stat. 506, section 307 of which (at 76 Stat. 526) subsequently repealed section 11 of act Aug. 10, 1949—except for "§411"—but did not repeal any of the sections in title IV directly. Nevertheless, the repeal of section 11, except for "§411", was executed as a repeal of title IV of the Act, except for this section. There is debate as to whether any of title IV of the Act continued to exist after the repeal such that section 411 remained a part of it or whether all other traces of the title were eliminated completely so that section 411 was effectively absorbed into title III. The subsequent renumbering of section 411 of the Act as section 312 by Pub. L. 116–92 suggests that this section should be considered within title III (as shown in the credit above), although there has been no explicit amendment renumbering the title of the Act containing it.

<br>§3093. Presidential approval and reporting of covert actions
<br>(a) Presidential findings
<br>
<br>The President may not authorize the conduct of a covert action by departments, agencies, or entities of the United States Government unless the President determines such an action is necessary to support identifiable foreign policy objectives of the United States and is important to the national security of the United States, which determination shall be set forth in a finding that shall meet each of the following conditions:
<br>
<br>(1) Each finding shall be in writing, unless immediate action by the United States is required and time does not permit the preparation of a written finding, in which case a written record of the President's decision shall be contemporaneously made and shall be reduced to a written finding as soon as possible but in no event more than 48 hours after the decision is made.
<br>
<br>(2) Except as permitted by paragraph (1), a finding may not authorize or sanction a covert action, or any aspect of any such action, which already has occurred.
<br>
<br>(3) Each finding shall specify each department, agency, or entity of the United States Government authorized to fund or otherwise participate in any significant way in such action. Any employee, contractor, or contract agent of a department, agency, or entity of the United States Government other than the Central Intelligence Agency directed to participate in any way in a covert action shall be subject either to the policies and regulations of the Central Intelligence Agency, or to written policies or regulations adopted by such department, agency, or entity, to govern such participation.
<br>
<br>(4) Each finding shall specify whether it is contemplated that any third party which is not an element of, or a contractor or contract agent of, the United States Government, or is not otherwise subject to United States Government policies and regulations, will be used to fund or otherwise participate in any significant way in the covert action concerned, or be used to undertake the covert action concerned on behalf of the United States.
<br>
<br>(5) A finding may not authorize any action that would violate the Constitution or any statute of the United States.
<br>(b) Reports to congressional intelligence committees; production of information
<br>
<br>To the extent consistent with due regard for the protection from unauthorized disclosure of classified information relating to sensitive intelligence sources and methods or other exceptionally sensitive matters, the Director of National Intelligence and the heads of all departments, agencies, and entities of the United States Government involved in a covert action—
<br>
<br>(1) shall keep the congressional intelligence committees fully and currently informed of all covert actions which are the responsibility of, are engaged in by, or are carried out for or on behalf of, any department, agency, or entity of the United States Government, including significant failures; and
<br>
<br>(2) shall furnish to the congressional intelligence committees any information or material concerning covert actions (including the legal basis under which the covert action is being or was conducted) which is in the possession, custody, or control of any department, agency, or entity of the United States Government and which is requested by either of the congressional intelligence committees in order to carry out its authorized responsibilities.
<br>(c) Timing of reports; access to finding
<br>
<br>(1) The President shall ensure that any finding approved pursuant to subsection (a) shall be reported in writing to the congressional intelligence committees as soon as possible after such approval and before the initiation of the covert action authorized by the finding, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (2) and paragraph (3).
<br>
<br>(2) If the President determines that it is essential to limit access to the finding to meet extraordinary circumstances affecting vital interests of the United States, the finding may be reported to the chairmen and ranking minority members of the congressional intelligence committees, the Speaker and minority leader of the House of Representatives, the majority and minority leaders of the Senate, and such other member or members of the congressional leadership as may be included by the President.
<br>
<br>(3) Whenever a finding is not reported pursuant to paragraph (1) or (2) of this section,1 the President shall fully inform the congressional intelligence committees in a timely fashion and shall provide a statement of the reasons for not giving prior notice.
<br>
<br>(4) In a case under paragraph (1), (2), or (3), a copy of the finding, signed by the President, shall be provided to the chairman of each congressional intelligence committee.
<br>
<br>(5)(A) When access to a finding, or a notification provided under subsection (d)(1), is limited to the Members of Congress specified in paragraph (2), a written statement of the reasons for limiting such access shall also be provided.
<br>
<br>(B) Not later than 180 days after a statement of reasons is submitted in accordance with subparagraph (A) or this subparagraph, the President shall ensure that—
<br>
<br>(i) all members of the congressional intelligence committees are provided access to the finding or notification; or
<br>
<br>(ii) a statement of reasons that it is essential to continue to limit access to such finding or such notification to meet extraordinary circumstances affecting vital interests of the United States is submitted to the Members of Congress specified in paragraph (2).
<br>(d) Changes in previously approved actions
<br>
<br>(1) The President shall ensure that the congressional intelligence committees, or, if applicable, the Members of Congress specified in subsection (c)(2), are notified in writing of any significant change in a previously approved covert action, or any significant undertaking pursuant to a previously approved finding, in the same manner as findings are reported pursuant to subsection (c).
<br>
<br>(2) In determining whether an activity constitutes a significant undertaking for purposes of paragraph (1), the President shall consider whether the activity—
<br>
<br>(A) involves significant risk of loss of life;
<br>
<br>(B) requires an expansion of existing authorities, including authorities relating to research, development, or operations;
<br>
<br>(C) results in the expenditure of significant funds or other resources;
<br>
