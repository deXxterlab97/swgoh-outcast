<br>Part VI—Central America Democracy, Peace, and Development Initiative
<br>§2271. Statement of policy
<br>(a) Congressional findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) the building of democracy, the restoration of peace, the improvement of living conditions, and the application of equal justice under law in Central America are important to the interests of the United States and the community of American States; and
<br>
<br>(2) the interrelated issues of social and human progress, economic growth, political reform, and regional security must be effectively dealt with to assure a democratic and economically and politically secure Central America.
<br>(b) Policy requirements
<br>
<br>(1) The achievement of democracy, respect for human rights, peace, and equitable economic growth depends primarily on the cooperation and the human and economic resources of the people and governments of Central America. The Congress recognizes that the United States can make a significant contribution to such peaceful and democratic development through a consistent and coherent policy which includes a long-term commitment of assistance. This policy should be designed to support actively—
<br>
<br>(A) democracy and political reform, including opening the political process to all members of society;
<br>
<br>(B) full observance of internationally recognized human rights, including free elections, freedom of the press, freedom of association, and the elimination of all human rights abuses;
<br>
<br>(C) leadership development, including training and educational programs to improve public administration and the administration of justice;
<br>
<br>(D) land reform, reform in tax systems, encouragement of private enterprise and individual initiative, creation of favorable investment climates, curbing corruption where it exists, and spurring balanced trade;
<br>
<br>(E) the establishment of the rule of law and an effective judicial system; and
<br>
<br>(F) the termination of extremist violence by both the left and the right as well as vigorous action to prosecute those guilty of crimes and the prosecution to the extent possible of past offenders.
<br>
<br>(2) The policy described in paragraph (1) should also promote equitable economic growth and development, including controlling the flight of capital and the effective use of foreign assistance and adhering to approved programs for economic stabilization and fiscal responsibility. Finally, this policy should foster dialog and negotiations—
<br>
<br>(A) to achieve peace based upon the objectives of democratization, reduction of armament, an end to subversion, and the withdrawal of foreign military forces and advisers; and
<br>
<br>(B) to provide a security shield against violence and intimidation.
<br>
<br>(3) It is the purpose of this part to establish the statutory framework and to authorize the appropriations and financing necessary to carry out the policy described in this section.
<br>(c) Additional Congressional findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds, therefore, that the people of the United States are willing to sustain and expand a program of economic and military assistance in Central America if the recipient countries can demonstrate progress toward and a commitment to these goals.

<br>§2274. Economic assistance coordination
<br>(a) Congressional findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that participation by Central American countries in an effective forum for dialog on, and the continuous review and advancement of, Central America's political, economic, and social development would foster cooperation between the United States and Central American countries.
<br>(b) Sense of Congress; Central American Development Organization; establishment, etc.
<br>
<br>It is the sense of the Congress that—
<br>
<br>(1) the President should enter into negotiations with the countries of Central America to establish a Central American Development Organization (hereafter in this section referred to as the "Organization") to help provide a continuous and coherent approach to the development of the Central American region; and
<br>
<br>(2) the establishment of the Organization should be based upon the following principles:
<br>
<br>(A) Participation in the Organization should be open to the United States, other donors, and those Central American countries that commit themselves to, among other things, respecting internationally recognized human rights, building democracy, and encouraging equitable economic growth through policy reforms.
<br>
<br>(B) The Organization should be structured to include representatives from both the public and private sectors, including representatives from the labor, agriculture, and business communities.
<br>
<br>(C) The Organization should meet periodically to carry out the functions described in subparagraphs (D) and (E) of this paragraph and should be supported by a limited professional secretariat.
<br>
<br>(D) The Organization should make recommendations affecting Central American countries on such matters as—
<br>
<br>(i) political, economic, and social development objectives, including the strengthening of democratic pluralism and the safeguarding of internationally recognized human rights;
<br>
<br>(ii) mobilization of resources and external assistance needs; and
<br>
<br>(iii) reform of economic policies and structures.
<br>
<br>(E) The Organization should have the capacity for monitoring country performance on recommendations issued in accordance with subparagraph (D) of this paragraph and for evaluating progress toward meeting such country objectives.
<br>
<br>(F) To the maximum extent practicable, the United States should follow the recommendations of the Organization in disbursing bilateral economic assistance for any Central American country. No more than 75 percent of such United States assistance in any fiscal year should be disbursed until the recommendations of the Organization for that fiscal year have been made final and communicated to the donor countries. The limitation on disbursements contained in the preceding sentence should apply only to recommendations made final and communicated to donor countries prior to the fourth quarter of such fiscal year. The United States representative to the Organization should urge other donor countries to similarly implement the recommendations of the Organization.
<br>
<br>(G) The administrator of the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter, or his designee, should represent the United States Government in the Organization and should carry out his functions in that capacity under the continuous supervision and general direction of the Secretary of State.
<br>(c) Participation of President in Organization
<br>
<br>Subject to subsection (d)(2), the President is authorized to participate in the Organization.
<br>(d) Preparation and transmission of proposal for implementation of provisions
<br>
<br>(1) The administrator of the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter, under the supervision and direction of the Secretary of State, shall prepare a detailed proposal to carry out this section and shall keep the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate fully and currently informed concerning the development of this proposal.
<br>
<br>(2) The President shall transmit to the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate a copy of the text of any agreement, which he proposes to sign, that would provide for the establishment of and United States participation in the Organization no less than sixty days prior to his signature. During that sixty-day period there shall be full and formal consultations with and review by those committees in accordance with procedures applicable to reprogramming notifications pursuant to section 2394–1 of this title.

<br>§2277a. Targeted sanctions to fight corruption in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras
<br>(a) Sense of Congress
<br>
<br>It is the sense of Congress that—
<br>
<br>(1) corruption in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras by private citizens and select officials in local, regional, and Federal governments significantly damages the economies of such countries and deprives citizens of opportunities;
<br>
<br>(2) corruption in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras is facilitated and carried out not only by private citizens and select officials from those countries but also in many instances by individuals from third countries; and
<br>
<br>(3) imposing targeted sanctions on individuals from throughout the world and particularly in the Western Hemisphere who are engaged in acts of significant corruption that impact El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras or obstruction of investigations into such acts of corruption will benefit the citizens and governments of such countries.
<br>(b) Report required
<br>
<br>Not later than 180 days after December 27, 2020, and not less frequently than annually thereafter, the President shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees an unclassified report with classified annex if necessary that identifies each foreign person who the President determines to have knowingly engaged in actions that undermine democratic processes or institutions, or in significant corruption or obstruction of investigations into such acts of corruption in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, including the following:
<br>
<br>(1) Corruption related to government contracts.
<br>
<br>(2) Bribery and extortion.
<br>
<br>(3) The facilitation or transfer of the proceeds of corruption, including through money laundering.
<br>
<br>(4) Acts of violence, harassment, or intimidation directed at governmental and nongovernmental corruption investigators.
<br>(c) Imposition of sanctions
<br>
<br>The President shall impose the sanctions described in subsection (d) with respect to each foreign person identified in the report required under subsection (b).
<br>(d) Sanctions described
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The sanctions described in this subsection are the following:

<br>The issuing consular officer or the Secretary of State, (or a designee of the Secretary of State) shall, in accordance with section 221(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1201(i)), revoke any visa or other entry documentation issued to a foreign person regardless of when the visa or other entry documentation is issued.
<br>(ii) Effect of revocation
<br>
<br>A revocation under clause (i) shall—
<br>
<br>(I) take effect immediately; and
<br>
<br>(II) automatically cancel any other valid visa or entry documentation that is in the foreign person's possession.
<br>(2) Exception to comply with international obligations
<br>
<br>Sanctions under subparagraph (B) and (C) 1 of paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to a foreign person if admitting or paroling such person into the United States is necessary to permit the United States to comply with the Agreement regarding the Headquarters of the United Nations, signed at Lake Success June 26, 1947, and entered into force November 21, 1947, between the United Nations and the United States, or other applicable international obligations.
<br>(e) National security waiver
<br>
<br>The President may waive the application of the sanctions under subsection (c) 2 if the President—
<br>
<br>(1) determines that such a waiver is in the national security interest of the United States; and
<br>
<br>(2) submits to the appropriate congressional committees within 15 days after such determination a notice of and justification for the waiver.
<br>(f) Termination
<br>
<br>The authority to impose sanctions under subsection (b),3 and any sanctions imposed pursuant to such authority, shall expire on the date that is 3 years after December 27, 2020.
<br>(g) Public availability
<br>
<br>The unclassified portion of the report required by subsection (b) shall be made available to the public, including through publication in the Federal Register.

<br>§2291. Policy, general authorities, coordination, foreign police actions, definitions, and other provisions
<br>(a) Policy and general authorities
<br>(1) Statements of policy
<br>
<br>(A) International narcotics trafficking poses an unparalleled transnational threat in today's world, and its suppression is among the most important foreign policy objectives of the United States.
<br>
<br>(B) Under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961, and under the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, the parties are required to criminalize certain drug-related activities, provide appropriately severe penalties, and cooperate in the extradition of accused offenders.
<br>
<br>(C) International narcotics control programs should include, as priority goals, the suppression of the illicit manufacture of and trafficking in narcotic and psychotropic drugs, money laundering, and precursor chemical diversion, and the progressive elimination of the illicit cultivation of the crops from which narcotic and psychotropic drugs are derived.
<br>
<br>(D) International criminal activities, particularly international narcotics trafficking, money laundering, and corruption, endanger political and economic stability and democratic development, and assistance for the prevention and suppression of international criminal activities should be a priority for the United States.
<br>
<br>(E) The international community should provide assistance, where appropriate, to those producer and transit countries which require assistance in discharging these primary obligations.
<br>
<br>(F) The objective of the United States in dealing with the problem of international money laundering is to ensure that countries adopt comprehensive domestic measures against money laundering and cooperate with each other in narcotics money laundering investigations, prosecutions, and related forfeiture actions.
<br>
<br>(G) Effective international cooperation is necessary to control the illicit cultivation, production, and smuggling of, trafficking in, and abuse of narcotic and psychotropic drugs.
<br>
<br>(2) In order to promote such cooperation, the President is authorized to conclude agreements, including reciprocal maritime agreements, with other countries to facilitate control of the production, processing, transportation, and distribution of narcotics analgesics, including opium and its derivatives, other narcotic and psychotropic drugs, and other controlled substances.
<br>
<br>(3) In order to promote international cooperation in combatting international trafficking in illicit narcotics, it shall be the policy of the United States to use its voice and vote in multilateral development banks to promote the development and implementation in the major illicit drug producing countries of programs for the reduction and eventual eradication of narcotic drugs and other controlled substances, including appropriate assistance in conjunction with effective programs of illicit crop eradication.
<br>
<br>(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the President is authorized to furnish assistance to any country or international organization, on such terms and conditions as he may determine, for the control of narcotic and psychotropic drugs and other controlled substances, or for other anticrime purposes.
<br>(b) Coordination of all United States antinarcotics assistance to foreign countries
<br>(1) Responsibility of Secretary of State
<br>
<br>Consistent with chapter 1 of the National Narcotics Leadership Act of 1988,1 the Secretary of State shall be responsible for coordinating all assistance provided by the United States Government to support international efforts to combat illicit narcotics production or trafficking.
<br>(2) Rule of construction
<br>
<br>Nothing contained in this subsection or section 2291h(b) of this title shall be construed to limit or impair the authority or responsibility of any other Federal agency with respect to law enforcement, domestic security operations, or intelligence activities as defined in Executive Order 12333.
<br>(c) Participation in foreign police actions

<br>
<br>No officer or employee of the United States may directly effect an arrest in any foreign country as part of any foreign police action with respect to narcotics control efforts, notwithstanding any other provision of law.

<br>
<br>Paragraph (1) does not prohibit an officer or employee of the United States, with the approval of the United States chief of mission, from being present when foreign officers are effecting an arrest or from assisting foreign officers who are effecting an arrest.
<br>(3) Exception for exigent, threatening circumstances
<br>
<br>Paragraph (1) does not prohibit an officer or employee from taking direct action to protect life or safety if exigent circumstances arise which are unanticipated and which pose an immediate threat to United States officers or employees, officers or employees of a foreign government, or members of the public.
<br>(4) Exception for maritime law enforcement
<br>
<br>With the agreement of a foreign country, paragraph (1) does not apply with respect to maritime law enforcement operations in the territorial sea or archipelagic waters of that country.
<br>(5) Interrogations
<br>
<br>No officer or employee of the United States may interrogate or be present during the interrogation of any United States person arrested in any foreign country with respect to narcotics control efforts without the written consent of such person.
<br>(6) Exception for Status of Forces arrangements
<br>
<br>This subsection does not apply to the activities of the United States Armed Forces in carrying out their responsibilities under applicable Status of Forces arrangements.
<br>(d) Use of herbicides for aerial eradication
<br>(1) Monitoring
<br>
<br>The President, with the assistance of appropriate Federal agencies, shall monitor any use under this part of a herbicide for aerial eradication in order to determine the impact of such use on the environment and on the health of individuals.
