<br>
<br>Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §831 (R.S. §984; June 10, 1921, ch. 18, §304, 42 Stat. 24).
<br>
<br>Section as revised conforms to existing Federal Practice. See note to subdivision (d) of Rule 54 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. For discussion as to verification of bill of costs under existing practice, see—8 Hughes, Federal Practice, Jurisdiction and Procedure—Civil and Criminal, §6441.
<br>
<br>Words "or allowed by the General Accounting Office" were omitted as unnecessary. That office will not allow items in a tax bill for costs against the United States unless such bill has been taxed by the court, and the court, under this section, cannot tax as costs items in an unverified bill.
<br>
<br>Changes were made in phraseology.
<br>§1925. Admiralty and maritime cases
<br>
<br>Except as otherwise provided by Act of Congress, the allowance and taxation of costs in admiralty and maritime cases shall be prescribed by rules promulgated by the Supreme Court.
<br>
<br>(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 957.)
<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>This section was drafted to make possible the promulgation of comprehensive and uniform rules governing costs in admiralty. Various enactments of Congress, all over 100 years old, relate to particular features of such matter, but do not set forth any comprehensive and uniform procedure. See, for example, sections 818, 826, and 827 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.
<br>§1926. Court of Federal Claims
<br>
<br>(a) The Judicial Conference of the United States shall prescribe from time to time the fees and costs to be charged and collected in the United States Court of Federal Claims.
<br>
<br>(b) The court and its officers shall collect only such fees and costs as the Judicial Conference prescribes. The court may require advance payment of fees by rule.

<br>

<br>Where the ministerial officers of the United States incur extraordinary expense in executing Acts of Congress, the payment of which is not specifically provided for, the Attorney General may allow the payment thereof.
<br>
<br>(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 957.)
<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §577 (R.S. §846; Feb. 18, 1875, ch. 80, §1, Stat. 318; May 28, 1896, ch. 252, §13, 29 Stat. 183; May 27, 1908, ch. 200, §1, 35 Stat. 375; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §291, 36 Stat. 1167; Feb. 26, 1919, ch. 49, §7, 40 Stat. 1182; Oct. 13, 1941, ch. 431, §1, 55 Stat. 736).
<br>
<br>Provision for payment of expenses under section 577 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., from appropriations for expenses of the judiciary was omitted as unnecessary. Such expenses are carried in the Judiciary Appropriation Acts and will continue without this provision.
<br>
<br>The first sentence of said section 577 is incorporated in section 551 of this title.
<br>
<br>The qualifying phrase "under the special taxation of the district court in which the said services have been or shall be rendered, to be paid from the appropriation for defraying the expenses of the Judiciary," was omitted, and the functions of allowing extraordinary expenses was vested in the Attorney General instead of the President. Neither the President nor the district judge should be burdened with such duty since the Attorney General only has the information upon which to act.
<br>
<br>Changes were made in phraseology.
<br>§1930. Bankruptcy fees
<br>
<br>(a) The parties commencing a case under title 11 shall pay to the clerk of the district court or the clerk of the bankruptcy court, if one has been certified pursuant to section 156(b) of this title, the following filing fees:

The fee shall be payable on the last day of the calendar month following the calendar quarter for which the fee is owed.
<br>

Such fees shall be deposited as offsetting receipts to the fund established under section 1931 of this title and shall remain available until expended.
<br>
<br>An individual commencing a voluntary case or a joint case under title 11 may pay such fee in installments. For converting, on request of the debtor, a case under chapter 7, or 13 of title 11, to a case under chapter 11 of title 11, the debtor shall pay to the clerk of the district court or the clerk of the bankruptcy court, if one has been certified pursuant to section 156(b) of this title, a fee of the amount equal to the difference between the fee specified in paragraph (3) and the fee specified in paragraph (1).

<br>
<br>(f)(1) Under the procedures prescribed by the Judicial Conference of the United States, the district court or the bankruptcy court may waive the filing fee in a case under chapter 7 of title 11 for an individual if the court determines that such individual has income less than 150 percent of the income official poverty line (as defined by the Office of Management and Budget, and revised annually in accordance with section 673(2) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981) applicable to a family of the size involved and is unable to pay that fee in installments.

<br>
<br>(2) The district court or the bankruptcy court may waive for such debtors other fees prescribed under subsections (b) and (c).
<br>
<br>(3) This subsection does not restrict the district court or the bankruptcy court from waiving, in accordance with Judicial Conference policy, fees prescribed under this section for other debtors and creditors.

<br>
<br>"(a) Findings.—Congress finds the following:
<br>
<br>"(1) Because of the importance of the goal that the bankruptcy system is self-funded, at no cost to the taxpayer, Congress has closely monitored the funding needs of the bankruptcy system, including by requiring periodic reporting by the Attorney General regarding the United States Trustee System Fund.
<br>
<br>"(2) Congress has amended the various bankruptcy fees as necessary to ensure that the bankruptcy system remains self-supporting, while also fairly allocating the costs of the system among those who use the system.
<br>
<br>"(3) Because the bankruptcy system is interconnected, the result has been a system of fees, including filing fees, quarterly fees in chapter 11 [11 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.] cases, and other fees, that together fund the courts, judges, United States trustees, and chapter 7 [11 U.S.C. 701 et seq.] case trustees necessary for the bankruptcy system to function.
<br>
<br>"(4) This Act [see Short Title of 2021 Amendment note set out under section 1 of this title] and the amendments made by this Act—
<br>
<br>"(A) ensure adequate funding of the United States trustees, supports the preservation of existing bankruptcy judgeships that are urgently needed to handle existing and anticipated increases in business and consumer caseloads, and provides long-overdue additional compensation for chapter 7 case trustees whose caseloads include chapter 11 reorganization cases that were converted to chapter 7 liquidation cases; and
<br>
<br>"(B) confirm the longstanding intention of Congress that quarterly fee requirements remain consistent across all Federal judicial districts.
<br>
<br>"(b) Purpose.—The purpose of this Act and the amendments made by this Act is to further the long-standing goal of Congress of ensuring that the bankruptcy system is self-funded, at no cost to the taxpayer."

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>This section follows the recommendation of the Supreme Court's Advisory Committee on Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (1937) which included the following rule:
<br>
<br>"Rule 77. Registration of judgments in other district courts. A judgment entered in any district court and which has become final through expiration of the time for appeal or by mandate on appeal may be registered in any other district court by filing therein an authenticated copy of the judgment. When so registered the judgment shall have the same effect and like proceedings for its enforcement may be taken thereon in the court in which it is registered as if the judgment had been originally entered by that court. If in the court in which the judgment was originally entered, the judgment has been satisfied in whole or in part or if an order has been made modifying or vacating it or affecting or suspending its operation, the party procuring the registration shall and any other party may file authenticated copies of the satisfaction or order with the court in which the judgment is registered. This rule shall not be construed to limit the effect of the Act of February 20, 1905, c. 592, §20 (33 Stat. 729), as amended, U.S.C., title 15, §100; or the Act of March 4, 1909, c. 320, §§36 and 37 (35 Stat. 1084), U.S.C., title 17, §§36 and 37; or §56 of the Judicial Code, U.S.C., title 28, §117; or to authorize the registration elsewhere of an order or a judgment rendered in a divorce action in the District of Columbia."
<br>
<br>Section 2508 of this title provides for the registration of judgments of the Court of Claims in favor of the United States in any district. See, also, section 2413 of this title.
<br>
<br>The phrase "for the recovery of money or property" was not in the committee's draft of Rule 77 of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure but was inserted in the revised section to exclude judgments in divorce actions, and any other actions, the registration of which would serve no useful purpose.

<br>
<br>(b) After a hearing, of which notice to all interested parties shall be given by publication or otherwise as the court directs, the court may order the sale of such realty or interest or any part thereof at private sale for cash or other consideration and upon such terms and conditions as the court approves, if it finds that the best interests of the estate will be conserved thereby.

No private sale shall be confirmed at a price less than two-thirds of the appraised value. Before confirmation of any private sale, the terms thereof shall be published in such newspaper or newspapers of general circulation as the court directs at least ten days before confirmation.

<br>A public sale of realty or interest therein under any order, judgment or decree of any court of the United States shall not be made without notice published once a week for at least four weeks prior to the sale in at least one newspaper regularly issued and of general circulation in the county, state, or judicial district of the United States wherein the realty is situated.
<br>
<br>If such realty is situated in more than one county, state, district or circuit, such notice shall be published in one or more of the counties, states, or districts wherein it is situated, as the court directs. The notice shall be substantially in such form and contain such description of the property by reference or otherwise as the court approves. The court may direct that the publication be made in other newspapers.
<br>
<br>This section shall not apply to sales and proceedings under Title 11 or by receivers or conservators of banks appointed by the Comptroller of the Currency.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>1948 Act
<br>
<br>Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §849 (Mar. 3, 1893, ch. 225, §3, 27 Stat. 751; Apr. 24, 1935, ch. 77, §3, 49 Stat. 160; June 19, 1935, ch. 276, 49 Stat. 390).
<br>
<br>A provision making the section applicable to pending proceedings was deleted as obsolete.
<br>
<br>Word "under" was substituted for "ordered pursuant to section 847 of this title by" after "A public sale of realty or interest therein".
<br>
<br>Sections 847 and 848, of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., now sections 2001 and 2004 of this title, relate only to sales under orders or decrees, without any reference to sales under judgments. In 1921 the Supreme Court held, in Yazoo & M. V. R. Co. v. City of Clarksdale, 1921, 42 S.Ct. 27, 257 U.S. 10, 66 L.Ed. 104, that such section 847 did not apply to sales under common law executions. At that time such section 849 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., read as it has been revised above, without any reference to such section 847. However, in 1935, such sections 847, 848 and 849 were amended by one act, ch. 77, 49 Stat. 159, and, in such section 849, the words "pursuant to the provisions of this Act" were inserted, but the word "judgment," though retained in such section 849, was not inserted in such sections 847 and 848. It is probable that Congress did not intend, in 1935 to make such sections 847 and 848 applicable to sales under judgments in law actions. Hence, to make all three sections consistent, the above-mentioned substitution was made.
<br>
<br>Reference to circuit was deleted from first and second paragraphs as unnecessary and inappropriate. Publication in a newspaper in a large circuit remote from the county in which the realty is situate, might be wholly insufficient to give notice to interested parties.
<br>
<br>Changes were made in phraseology.

<br>§2003. Marshal's incapacity after levy on or sale of realty
<br>
<br>Whenever a United States marshal dies, is removed from office, or the term of his commission expires, after levying on realty or any interest therein under a writ of execution issued by a court of the United States, and before sale or other final disposition thereof, like process shall issue to the succeeding marshal and the same proceedings shall be had as if such contingency had not occurred.
<br>
<br>Whenever any such contingency arises after a marshal has sold any realty or interest therein and before a deed is executed, the court may, on application by the purchaser, or the plaintiff in whose action the sale was made, setting forth the facts of the case and the reason why the title was not perfected by such marshal, order the succeeding marshal to perfect the title and execute a deed to the purchaser, upon payment of the purchase money and unpaid costs.

<br>§2005. Appraisal of goods taken on execution
<br>
<br>Whenever State law requires that goods taken on execution be appraised before sale, goods taken under execution issued from a court of the United States shall be appraised in like manner.
<br>
<br>The United States marshal shall summon the appraisers in the same manner as the sheriff is required to summon appraisers under State law.
<br>
<br>If the appraisers fail to attend and perform their required duties, the marshal may sell the goods without an appraisal. Appraisers attending and performing their duties, shall receive the fees allowed for appraisals under State law.

<br>
<br>Words "shall be appraised in like manner" were substituted for "the appraisers appointed under the authority of the State may appraise goods taken in execution on a fieri facias issued out of any court of the United States". The change precludes construction that the State appraisers only are available to appraise such goods in civil actions in the federal courts.
<br>
<br>Changes were made in phraseology.
<br>§2006. Execution against revenue officer
<br>
<br>Execution shall not issue against a collector or other revenue officer on a final judgment in any proceeding against him for any of his acts, or for the recovery of any money exacted by or paid to him and subsequently paid into the Treasury, in performing his official duties, if the court certifies that:
<br>
<br>(1) probable cause existed; or
<br>
<br>(2) the officer acted under the directions of the Secretary of the Treasury, the Director, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, Department of Justice, or other proper Government officer.
<br>
<br>When such certificate has been issued, the amount of the judgment shall be paid out of the proper appropriation by the Treasury.

Section 761 of such title related to rules established in the district courts and Court of Claims. Section 1111 of title 26, U.S.C., 1940 ed., related to Tax Court. This section consolidates all such provisions. For other provisions of such sections, see Distribution Table.
<br>
<br>Recognition by Congress of the broad rule-making power of the courts will make it possible for the courts to prescribe complete and uniform modes of procedure, and alleviate, at least in part, the necessity of searching in two places, namely in the Acts of Congress and in the rules of the courts, for procedural requisites.
<br>
<br>Former Attorney General Cummings recently said: "Legislative bodies have neither the time to inquire objectively into the details of judicial procedure nor the opportunity to determine the necessity for amendment or change. Frequently such legislation has been enacted for the purpose of meeting particular problems or supposed difficulties, but the results have usually been confusing or otherwise unsatisfactory. Comprehensive action has been lacking for the obvious reason that the professional nature of the task would leave the legislature little time for matters of substance and statesmanship. It often happened that an admitted need for change, even in limited areas, could not be secured."—The New Criminal Rules—Another Triumph of the Democratic Process. American Bar Association Journal, May 1945.
<br>
<br>Provisions of sections 263 and 296 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., authorizing the Court of Claims and Customs Court to punish for contempt, were omitted as covered by H. R. 1600, §401, 80th Congress, for revision of the Criminal Code.
<br>
<br>Provisions of section 1111 of title 26, U.S.C., 1940 ed., making applicable to Tax Court Proceedings "the rules of evidence applicable in the courts of the District of Columbia in the type of proceeding which, prior to Sept. 16, 1938, were within the jurisdiction of the courts of equity of said District," were omitted as unnecessary and inconsistent with other provisions of law relating to the Federal courts. The rules of evidence in Tax Court proceedings are the same as those which apply to civil procedure in other courts. See Dempster Mill. Mfg. Co. v. Burnet, 1931, 46 F.2d 604, 60 App.D.C. 23.

<br>For rule-making power of the Supreme Court in copyright infringement actions, see section 25(e) of title 17, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Copyrights. See, also, section 205(a) of title 11, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Bankruptcy, authorizing the Supreme Court to promulgate rules relating to service of process in railroad reorganization proceedings.
<br>Senate Revision Amendment
<br>
<br>By Senate amendment, all provisions relating to the Tax Court were eliminated. Therefore, section 1111 of Title 26, U.S.C., Internal Revenue Code, was not one of the sources of this section as finally enacted. However, no change in the text of this section was necessary. See 80th Congress Senate Report No. 1559.
<br>1949 Act
<br>
<br>This amendment clarifies section 2071 of title 28, U.S.C., by giving express recognition to the power of the Supreme Court to prescribe its own rules and by giving a better description of its procedural rules.
