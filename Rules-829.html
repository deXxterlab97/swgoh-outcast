<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on sections 592, 597 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking (R.S. §5209; Dec. 23, 1913, ch. 6, §22(i) as added June 19, 1934, ch. 653, §3, 48 Stat. 1107; Sept. 26, 1918, ch. 177, §7, 40 Stat. 972; Aug. 23, 1935, ch. 614, §316, 49 Stat. 712).
<br>
<br>(See reviser's note under section 656 of this title for comprehensive statement of reasons for separating section 592 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, into three revised sections, and section 597 thereof into two revised sections, with the consequent extensive changes in phraseology, style, and arrangement.)
<br>
<br>In this section, national bank receivers and Federal reserve agents were not included in the initial enumeration of persons at whom the act is directed, since the provisions of this section, unlike section 656 of this title, are not directed at such receivers and agents.
<br>
<br>No changes of meaning or substance were made, except that, like said section 656 of this title, the different punishment provisions were reconciled, and one uniform punishment provision was adopted.
<br>
<br>The words "shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor" were omitted as unnecessary in view of the definition of a misdemeanor in section 1 of this title.
<br>
<br>The words "and upon conviction thereof" were omitted as unnecessary, since punishment cannot be imposed until a conviction is secured.
<br>
<br>Since section 3231 of this title gives the district court jurisdiction of criminal prosecutions, the words "in any district court of the United States" were omitted as unnecessary.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>1948 Act
<br>
<br>Based on sections 1026(b) and 1514(c) of title 7, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Agriculture, sections 264(u), 984, 1121, 1138d(c), 1311, 1441(c), 1467(c) and 1731(c) of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, and section 616(c) of title 15, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Commerce and Trade (Dec. 23, 1913, ch. 6, §12B(u), as added June 16, 1933, ch. 89, §8, 48 Stat. 178; July 17, 1916, ch. 245, §31, fourth par., 39 Stat. 383; July 17, 1916, ch. 245, §211(a), as added Mar. 4, 1923, ch. 252, §2, 42 Stat. 1459; Mar. 4, 1923, ch. 252, title II, §216(a), 42 Stat. 1471; Jan. 22, 1932, ch. 8, §16(c), 47 Stat. 11; July 22, 1932, ch. 522, §21(c), 47 Stat. 738; Ex. Ord. No. 6084, Mar. 27, 1933; June 13, 1933, ch. 64, §8(c), 48 Stat. 135; June 16, 1933, ch. 98, §64(c), 48 Stat. 268; Jan. 31, 1934, ch. 7, §13, 48 Stat. 347; June 27, 1934, ch. 847, §512(c), 48 Stat. 1265; Aug. 23, 1935, ch. 614, §101, 49 Stat. 701; July 22, 1937, ch. 517, title IV, §52(b), 50 Stat. 532; Feb. 16, 1938, ch. 30, title V, §514(c), 52 Stat. 76; Aug. 14, 1946, ch. 964, §3, 60 Stat. 1064).
<br>
<br>Each of the eleven sections from which this section was derived contained similar provisions relating to embezzlement, false entries, and fraudulent issuance or assignment of obligations with respect to one or more named agencies or corporations.
<br>
<br>These were divided and the false entry and fraudulent issuance or assignment of obligation provisions of all, form the basis of this section. The remaining provisions of each section, relating to embezzlement and misapplication, form the basis for section 657 of this title. That portion of said section 616(c) of title 15, relating to disclosure of information, forms the basis for section 1904 of this title.
<br>
<br>Each revised section condenses and simplifies the constituent provisions without change of substance except as herein indicated.
<br>
<br>The punishment provisions in each section were the same except that in section 1026(b) of title 7, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and sections 984, 1121, and 1311 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., the maximum fine was $5,000. This consolidated section adopts the $10,000 maximum fine provided by the seven other sections.
<br>
<br>References to persons aiding or abetting contained in sections 984, 1121, and 1311 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted as unnecessary, as such persons are made principals by section 2 of this title.
<br>
<br>The term "receiver," used in sections 1121 and 1311 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with reference to Federal intermediate credit banks and agricultural credit corporations, was omitted as this term is undoubtedly embraced in the phrase "or connected in any capacity with."
<br>
<br>The term "or of any department or agency of the United States" was inserted in order to clarify the sweeping provisions against fraudulent acts and to eliminate any possible ambiguity as to scope of section. (See definitions of "department" and "agency" in section 6 of this title.)
<br>
<br>Words "shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor", contained in section 1311 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted as unnecessary, in view of definition of misdemeanor in section 1 of this title.
<br>
<br>Words "and upon conviction", contained in section 1311 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted as surplusage, because punishment cannot be imposed until after conviction.
<br>
<br>Words "in any district court of the United States", contained in section 1311 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted as unnecessary, because section 3231 of this title confers jurisdiction on the Federal district courts of all crimes and offenses defined in this title.
<br>
<br>The conspiracy provisions of section 1138d(f) of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, were not added to this consolidated section for reasons stated in reviser's note under section 493 of this title. (See also reviser's note under section 371 of this title.)
<br>1949 Act
<br>
<br>[Section 20] conforms section 1006 of title 18, U.S.C., to administrative practice which in turn was modified to comply with congressional policy. (See note to sec. 11 [of 1949 Act, set out in Historical and Revision Notes under section 657 of this title]).

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>1948 Act
<br>
<br>Based on sections 1026(a) and 1514(a) of title 7, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Agriculture, sections 596, 981, 1122, 1123, 1138d(a), 1248, 1312, 1313, 1441(a), and 1467(a), of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, and section 616(a) of title 15, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Commerce and Trade (Dec. 23, 1913, ch. 6, §22(h), as added June 19, 1934, ch. 653, §3, 48 Stat. 1107; July 17, 1916, ch. 245, §31, first paragraph, 39 Stat. 382; July 17, 1916, ch. 245, §211(b), (c), as added Mar. 4, 1923, ch. 252, §2, 42 Stat. 1460; Mar. 4, 1923, ch. 252, title II, §§209(h), 216(b), (c), 42 Stat. 1468, 1472; Jan. 22, 1932, ch. 8, §16 (a), 47 Stat. 11; July 22, 1932, ch. 522, §21(a), 47 Stat. 738; June 13, 1933, ch. 64, §8(a), 48 Stat. 134; June 16, 1933, ch. 98, §64(a), 48 Stat. 267; Jan. 31, 1934, ch. 7, §13, 48 Stat. 347; June 3, 1935, ch. 164, §21, 49 Stat. 319; July 22, 1937, ch. 517, title IV, §52(a); 50 Stat. 531; Feb. 16, 1938, ch. 30, title V, §514(a), 52 Stat. 76; Aug. 14, 1946, ch. 964, §3, 60 Stat. 1064).
<br>
<br>Each of the 13 sections from which this section was derived contained similar provisions either relating to false representations and statements, or overvaluation of security, with respect to one or more of the named banks, agencies, or corporations.
<br>
<br>These were consolidated and the false statement and security overvaluation provisions of all, form the basis of this section. The provisions of section 981 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, relating to acceptance of loans or gratuities by examiners, were consolidated with similar provisions from other sections to form section 218 [now section 213] of this title. The provisions of said section 981 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, prohibiting land bank and national farm loan association examiners from performing "any other service for compensation for any bank or banking or loan association, or for any person connected therewith in any capacity" were consolidated with similar provisions from other sections to form section 1909 of this title.
<br>
<br>Eight of the consolidated sections contained identical punishment, each providing for a maximum fine of $5,000 and maximum imprisonment of 2 years. Two sections provided for a maximum fine of $10,000 and maximum imprisonment of 5 years. One section provided for maximum fine of $5,000 and maximum imprisonment of 5 years, one section provided for maximum fine of $2,000 and maximum imprisonment of 2 years, and one section provided for maximum fine of $5,000 and maximum imprisonment of 1 year.
<br>
<br>The punishment by maximum fine of $5,000 or maximum imprisonment of 2 years, or both, provided in this consolidated section was adopted as most consistent with the greater number of comparable sections. (See sections 1008 and 1010 of this title.) This is a reasonable reconciliation of the conflicting punishment provisions and adequate for the offenses described.
<br>
<br>The enumeration of "application, advance, discount, purchase, purchase agreement, repurchase agreement, commitment, or loan" and the wording "or any change or extension of any of the same, by renewal, deferment of action or otherwise, or the acceptance, release, or substitution of security therefor" does not occur in any one of the original sections, but such enumeration and such wording are adequate, and they represent a composite of terms and transactions mentioned in each.
<br>
<br>In addition, changes were made in phraseology to secure uniformity of style, and some rephrasing was necessary, but the consolidation was without change of substance except as above indicated.
<br>
<br>Section 1138d(f) of Title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, relating to conspiracy, was not added to this consolidated section for reasons given in reviser's note under section 493 of this title.
<br>1949 Act
<br>
<br>[Section 21] conforms section 1014 of Title 18 U.S.C., to administrative practice which in turn was modified to comply with congressional policy. (See note to sec. 11 [of 1949 Act, set out in Historical and Revision note under section 657 of this title]).
