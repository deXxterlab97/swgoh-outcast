<br>
<br>(7) to help the Government of Ukraine prepare for the presidential election in May 2014;

<br>
<br>(9) to support the efforts of the Government of Ukraine to recover and return to the Ukrainian state funds stolen by former President Yanukovych, his family, and other current and former members of the Ukrainian government and elites;
<br>
<br>(10) to support the continued professionalization of the Ukrainian military;

<br>
<br>(16) to explore ways for the United States Government to assist the countries of Central and Eastern Europe to diversify their energy sources and achieve energy security; and
