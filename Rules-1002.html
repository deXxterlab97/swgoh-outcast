<br>
<br>"(1) the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003 [this part] addresses the unique situations that active duty military personnel and other affected individuals may face in connection with their enrollment in postsecondary institutions and their Federal student loans; and

<br>§1098bb. Waiver authority for response to military contingencies and national emergencies
<br>(a) Waivers and modifications
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, unless enacted with specific reference to this section, the Secretary of Education (referred to in this part as the "Secretary") may waive or modify any statutory or regulatory provision applicable to the student financial assistance programs under title IV of the Act [20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq.] as the Secretary deems necessary in connection with a war or other military operation or national emergency to provide the waivers or modifications authorized by paragraph (2).
<br>(2) Actions authorized
<br>
<br>The Secretary is authorized to waive or modify any provision described in paragraph (1) as may be necessary to ensure that—
<br>
<br>(A) recipients of student financial assistance under title IV of the Act who are affected individuals are not placed in a worse position financially in relation to that financial assistance because of their status as affected individuals;
<br>
<br>(B) administrative requirements placed on affected individuals who are recipients of student financial assistance are minimized, to the extent possible without impairing the integrity of the student financial assistance programs, to ease the burden on such students and avoid inadvertent, technical violations or defaults;
<br>
<br>(C) the calculation of "annual adjusted family income" and "available income", as used in the determination of need for student financial assistance under title IV of the Act for any such affected individual (and the determination of such need for his or her spouse and dependents, if applicable), may be modified to mean the sums received in the first calendar year of the award year for which such determination is made, in order to reflect more accurately the financial condition of such affected individual and his or her family;
<br>
<br>(D) the calculation under section 484B(b)(2) of the Act (20 U.S.C. 1091b(b)(2)) of the amount a student is required to return in the case of an affected individual may be modified so that no overpayment will be required to be returned or repaid if the institution has documented (i) the student's status as an affected individual in the student's file, and (ii) the amount of any overpayment discharged; and
<br>
<br>(E) institutions of higher education, eligible lenders, guaranty agencies, and other entities participating in the student assistance programs under title IV of the Act that are located in areas that are declared disaster areas by any Federal, State or local official in connection with a national emergency, or whose operations are significantly affected by such a disaster, may be granted temporary relief from requirements that are rendered infeasible or unreasonable by a national emergency, including due diligence requirements and reporting deadlines.
<br>(b) Notice of waivers or modifications
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding section 1232 of this title and section 553 of title 5, the Secretary shall, by notice in the Federal Register, publish the waivers or modifications of statutory and regulatory provisions the Secretary deems necessary to achieve the purposes of this section.
<br>(2) Terms and conditions
<br>
<br>The notice under paragraph (1) shall include the terms and conditions to be applied in lieu of such statutory and regulatory provisions.
<br>(3) Case-by-case basis
<br>
<br>The Secretary is not required to exercise the waiver or modification authority under this section on a case-by-case basis.
<br>(c) Impact report
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall, not later than 15 months after first exercising any authority to issue a waiver or modification under subsection (a), report to the Committee on Education and the Workforce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions of the Senate on the impact of any waivers or modifications issued pursuant to subsection (a) on affected individuals and the programs under title IV of the Act [20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq.], and the basis for such determination, and include in such report the Secretary's recommendations for changes to the statutory or regulatory provisions that were the subject of such waiver or modification.
<br>(d) No delay in waivers and modifications
<br>
<br>Sections 482(c) and 492 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1089(c), 1098a) shall not apply to the waivers and modifications authorized or required by this part.

<br>(a) Sense of Congress
<br>
<br>It is the sense of Congress that—
<br>
<br>(1) all institutions offering postsecondary education should provide a full refund to students who are affected individuals for that portion of a period of instruction such student was unable to complete, or for which such individual did not receive academic credit, because he or she was called up for active duty or active service; and
<br>
<br>(2) if affected individuals withdraw from a course of study as a result of such active duty or active service, such institutions should make every effort to minimize deferral of enrollment or reapplication requirements and should provide the greatest flexibility possible with administrative deadlines related to those applications.
<br>(b) Definition of full refund
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, a full refund includes a refund of required tuition and fees, or a credit in a comparable amount against future tuition and fees.

<br>§1099b. Recognition of accrediting agency or association
<br>(a) Criteria required
<br>
<br>No accrediting agency or association may be determined by the Secretary to be a reliable authority as to the quality of education or training offered for the purposes of this chapter or for other Federal purposes, unless the agency or association meets criteria established by the Secretary pursuant to this section. The Secretary shall, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, establish criteria for such determinations. Such criteria shall include an appropriate measure or measures of student achievement. Such criteria shall require that—
<br>
<br>(1) the accrediting agency or association shall be a State, regional, or national agency or association and shall demonstrate the ability and the experience to operate as an accrediting agency or association within the State, region, or nationally, as appropriate;
<br>
<br>(2) such agency or association—
<br>
<br>(A)(i) for the purpose of participation in programs under this chapter, has a voluntary membership of institutions of higher education and has as a principal purpose the accrediting of institutions of higher education; or
<br>
<br>(ii) for the purpose of participation in other programs administered by the Department of Education or other Federal agencies, has a voluntary membership and has as its principal purpose the accrediting of institutions of higher education or programs;
<br>
<br>(B) is a State agency approved by the Secretary for the purpose described in subparagraph (A); or
<br>
<br>(C) is an agency or association that, for the purpose of determining eligibility for student assistance under this subchapter, conducts accreditation through (i) a voluntary membership organization of individuals participating in a profession, or (ii) an agency or association which has as its principal purpose the accreditation of programs within institutions, which institutions are accredited by another agency or association recognized by the Secretary;
<br>
<br>(3) if such agency or association is an agency or association described in—
<br>
<br>(A) subparagraph (A)(i) of paragraph (2), then such agency or association is separate and independent, both administratively and financially of any related, associated, or affiliated trade association or membership organization;
<br>
<br>(B) subparagraph (B) of paragraph (2), then such agency or association has been recognized by the Secretary on or before October 1, 1991; or
<br>
<br>(C) subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) and such agency or association has been recognized by the Secretary on or before October 1, 1991, then the Secretary may waive the requirement that such agency or association is separate and independent, both administratively and financially of any related, associated, or affiliated trade association or membership organization upon a demonstration that the existing relationship has not served to compromise the independence of its accreditation process;
<br>
<br>(4)(A) such agency or association consistently applies and enforces standards that respect the stated mission of the institution of higher education, including religious missions, and that ensure that the courses or programs of instruction, training, or study offered by the institution of higher education, including distance education or correspondence courses or programs, are of sufficient quality to achieve, for the duration of the accreditation period, the stated objective for which the courses or the programs are offered; and
<br>
<br>(B) if such agency or association has or seeks to include within its scope of recognition the evaluation of the quality of institutions or programs offering distance education or correspondence education, such agency or association shall, in addition to meeting the other requirements of this subpart, demonstrate to the Secretary that—
<br>
<br>(i) the agency or association's standards effectively address the quality of an institution's distance education or correspondence education in the areas identified in paragraph (5), except that—
<br>
<br>(I) the agency or association shall not be required to have separate standards, procedures, or policies for the evaluation of distance education or correspondence education institutions or programs in order to meet the requirements of this subparagraph; and
<br>
<br>(II) in the case that the agency or association is recognized by the Secretary, the agency or association shall not be required to obtain the approval of the Secretary to expand its scope of accreditation to include distance education or correspondence education, provided that the agency or association notifies the Secretary in writing of the change in scope; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the agency or association requires an institution that offers distance education or correspondence education to have processes through which the institution establishes that the student who registers in a distance education or correspondence education course or program is the same student who participates in and completes the program and receives the academic credit;
<br>
<br>(5) the standards for accreditation of the agency or association assess the institution's—
<br>
<br>(A) success with respect to student achievement in relation to the institution's mission, which may include different standards for different institutions or programs, as established by the institution, including, as appropriate, consideration of State licensing examinations, consideration of course completion, and job placement rates;
<br>
<br>(B) curricula;
<br>
<br>(C) faculty;
<br>
<br>(D) facilities, equipment, and supplies;
<br>

<br>(G) recruiting and admissions practices, academic calendars, catalogs, publications, grading and advertising;
<br>
<br>(H) measures of program length and the objectives of the degrees or credentials offered;
<br>
<br>(I) record of student complaints received by, or available to, the agency or association; and
<br>

<br>
<br>except that subparagraphs (A), (H), and (J) shall not apply to agencies or associations described in paragraph (2)(A)(ii) of this subsection;
<br>
<br>(6) such an agency or association shall establish and apply review procedures throughout the accrediting process, including evaluation and withdrawal proceedings, which comply with due process procedures that provide—
<br>
<br>(A) for adequate written specification of—
<br>
<br>(i) requirements, including clear standards for an institution of higher education or program to be accredited; and
<br>
<br>(ii) identified deficiencies at the institution or program examined;
<br>
<br>(B) for sufficient opportunity for a written response, by an institution or program, regarding any deficiencies identified by the agency or association to be considered by the agency or association—
<br>
<br>(i) within a timeframe determined by the agency or association; and
<br>
<br>(ii) prior to final action in the evaluation and withdrawal proceedings;
<br>
<br>(C) upon the written request of an institution or program, for an opportunity for the institution or program to appeal any adverse action under this section, including denial, withdrawal, suspension, or termination of accreditation, taken against the institution or program, prior to such action becoming final at a hearing before an appeals panel that—

<br>(i) shall not include current members of the agency's or association's underlying decisionmaking body that made the adverse decision; and
<br>
<br>(ii) is subject to a conflict of interest policy;
<br>
<br>(D) for the right to representation and participation by counsel for an institution or program during an appeal of the adverse action;
<br>
<br>(E) for a process, in accordance with written procedures developed by the agency or association, through which an institution or program, before a final adverse action based solely upon a failure to meet a standard or criterion pertaining to finances, may on one occasion seek review of significant financial information that was unavailable to the institution or program prior to the determination of the adverse action, and that bears materially on the financial deficiencies identified by the agency or association;
<br>
<br>(F) in the case that the agency or association determines that the new financial information submitted by the institution or program under subparagraph (E) meets the criteria of significance and materiality described in such subparagraph, for consideration by the agency or association of the new financial information prior to the adverse action described in such subparagraph becoming final; and
<br>
<br>(G) that any determination by the agency or association made with respect to the new financial information described in subparagraph (E) shall not be separately appealable by the institution or program;
<br>
<br>(7) such agency or association shall notify the Secretary and the appropriate State licensing or authorizing agency within 30 days of the accreditation of an institution or any final denial, withdrawal, suspension, or termination of accreditation or placement on probation of an institution, together with any other adverse action taken with respect to an institution; and
<br>
<br>(8) such agency or association shall make available to the public, upon request, and to the Secretary, and the State licensing or authorizing agency a summary of any review resulting in a final accrediting decision involving denial, termination, or suspension of accreditation, together with the comments of the affected institution.
<br>(b) "Separate and independent" defined
<br>
<br>For the purpose of subsection (a)(3), the term "separate and independent" means that—

<br>
<br>(2) among the membership of the board of the accrediting agency or association there shall be one public member (who is not a member of any related trade or membership organization) for each six members of the board, with a minimum of one such public member, and guidelines are established for such members to avoid conflicts of interest;
<br>
<br>(3) dues to the accrediting agency or association are paid separately from any dues paid to any related, associated, or affiliated trade association or membership organization; and

<br>
<br>(8) discloses publicly whenever an institution of higher education subject to its jurisdiction is being considered for accreditation or reaccreditation; and

<br>(g) Limitation on scope of criteria
<br>

<br>
<br>The Secretary shall not recognize the accreditation of any otherwise eligible institution of higher education if the institution of higher education is in the process of changing its accrediting agency or association, unless the eligible institution submits to the Secretary all materials relating to the prior accreditation, including materials demonstrating reasonable cause for changing the accrediting agency or association.
<br>(i) Dual accreditation rule
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall not recognize the accreditation of any otherwise eligible institution of higher education if the institution of higher education is accredited, as an institution, by more than one accrediting agency or association, unless the institution submits to each such agency and association and to the Secretary the reasons for accreditation by more than one such agency or association and demonstrates to the Secretary reasonable cause for its accreditation by more than one agency or association. If the institution is accredited, as an institution, by more than one accrediting agency or association, the institution shall designate which agency's accreditation shall be utilized in determining the institution's eligibility for programs under this chapter.
<br>(j) Impact of loss of accreditation
<br>
<br>An institution may not be certified or recertified as an institution of higher education under section 1002 of this title and subpart 3 of this part or participate in any of the other programs authorized by this chapter if such institution—
<br>
<br>(1) is not currently accredited by any agency or association recognized by the Secretary;
<br>
<br>(2) has had its accreditation withdrawn, revoked, or otherwise terminated for cause during the preceding 24 months, unless such withdrawal, revocation, or termination has been rescinded by the same accrediting agency; or
<br>
<br>(3) has withdrawn from accreditation voluntarily under a show cause or suspension order during the preceding 24 months, unless such order has been rescinded by the same accrediting agency.
<br>(k) Religious institution rule
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding subsection (j), the Secretary shall allow an institution that has had its accreditation withdrawn, revoked, or otherwise terminated, or has voluntarily withdrawn from an accreditation agency, to remain certified as an institution of higher education under section 1002 of this title and subpart 3 of this part for a period sufficient to allow such institution to obtain alternative accreditation, if the Secretary determines that the reason for the withdrawal, revocation, or termination—
<br>
<br>(1) is related to the religious mission or affiliation of the institution; and
<br>
<br>(2) is not related to the accreditation criteria provided for in this section.
<br>(l) Limitation, suspension, or termination of recognition
<br>
<br>(1) If the Secretary determines that an accrediting agency or association has failed to apply effectively the criteria in this section, or is otherwise not in compliance with the requirements of this section, the Secretary shall—
<br>
<br>(A) after notice and opportunity for a hearing, limit, suspend, or terminate the recognition of the agency or association; or
<br>
<br>(B) require the agency or association to take appropriate action to bring the agency or association into compliance with such requirements within a timeframe specified by the Secretary, except that—
<br>
<br>(i) such timeframe shall not exceed 12 months unless the Secretary extends such period for good cause; and
<br>
<br>(ii) if the agency or association fails to bring the agency or association into compliance within such timeframe, the Secretary shall, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, limit, suspend, or terminate the recognition of the agency or association.
<br>
<br>(2) The Secretary may determine that an accrediting agency or association has failed to apply effectively the standards provided in this section if an institution of higher education seeks and receives accreditation from the accrediting agency or association during any period in which the institution is the subject of any interim action by another accrediting agency or association, described in paragraph (2)(A)(i), (2)(B), or (2)(C) of subsection (a) of this section, leading to the suspension, revocation, or termination of accreditation or the institution has been notified of the threatened loss of accreditation, and the due process procedures required by such suspension, revocation, termination, or threatened loss have not been completed.
<br>(m) Limitation on Secretary's authority
<br>
<br>The Secretary may only recognize accrediting agencies or associations which accredit institutions of higher education for the purpose of enabling such institutions to establish eligibility to participate in the programs under this chapter or which accredit institutions of higher education or higher education programs for the purpose of enabling them to establish eligibility to participate in other programs administered by the Department of Education or other Federal agencies.
<br>(n) Independent evaluation
<br>
<br>(1) The Secretary shall conduct a comprehensive review and evaluation of the performance of all accrediting agencies or associations which seek recognition by the Secretary in order to determine whether such accrediting agencies or associations meet the criteria established by this section. The Secretary shall conduct an independent evaluation of the information provided by such agency or association. Such evaluation shall include—
<br>
<br>(A) the solicitation of third-party information concerning the performance of the accrediting agency or association; and
<br>
<br>(B) site visits, including unannounced site visits as appropriate, at accrediting agencies and associations, and, at the Secretary's discretion, at representative member institutions.
<br>
<br>(2) The Secretary shall place a priority for review of accrediting agencies or associations on those agencies or associations that accredit institutions of higher education that participate most extensively in the programs authorized by this subchapter and on those agencies or associations which have been the subject of the most complaints or legal actions.
<br>
<br>(3) The Secretary shall consider all available relevant information concerning the compliance of the accrediting agency or association with the criteria provided for in this section, including any complaints or legal actions against such agency or association. In cases where deficiencies in the performance of an accreditation agency or association with respect to the requirements of this section are noted, the Secretary shall take these deficiencies into account in the recognition process. The Secretary shall not, under any circumstances, base decisions on the recognition or denial of recognition of accreditation agencies or associations on criteria other than those contained in this section. When the Secretary decides to recognize an accrediting agency or association, the Secretary shall determine the agency or association's scope of recognition. If the agency or association reviews institutions offering distance education courses or programs and the Secretary determines that the agency or association meets the requirements of this section, then the agency shall be recognized and the scope of recognition shall include accreditation of institutions offering distance education courses or programs.
<br>
<br>(4) The Secretary shall maintain sufficient documentation to support the conclusions reached in the recognition process, and, if the Secretary does not recognize any accreditation agency or association, shall make publicly available the reason for denying recognition, including reference to the specific criteria under this section which have not been fulfilled.
<br>(o) Regulations
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall by regulation provide procedures for the recognition of accrediting agencies or associations and for the appeal of the Secretary's decisions. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary shall not promulgate any regulation with respect to the standards of an accreditation agency or association described in subsection (a)(5).
<br>(p) Rule of construction
<br>
<br>Nothing in subsection (a)(5) shall be construed to restrict the ability of—
<br>
<br>(1) an accrediting agency or association to set, with the involvement of its members, and to apply, accreditation standards for or to institutions or programs that seek review by the agency or association; or
<br>
<br>(2) an institution to develop and use institutional standards to show its success with respect to student achievement, which achievement may be considered as part of any accreditation review.
<br>(q) Review of scope changes
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall require a review, at the next available meeting of the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity, of any change in scope undertaken by an agency or association under subsection (a)(4)(B)(i)(II) if the enrollment of an institution that offers distance education or correspondence education that is accredited by such agency or association increases by 50 percent or more within any one institutional fiscal year.

<br>
<br>For purposes of qualifying institutions of higher education for participation in programs under this subchapter, the Secretary shall determine the legal authority to operate within a State, the accreditation status, and the administrative capability and financial responsibility of an institution of higher education in accordance with the requirements of this section.
<br>(b) Single application form
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall prepare and prescribe a single application form which—
<br>
<br>(1) requires sufficient information and documentation to determine that the requirements of eligibility, accreditation, financial responsibility, and administrative capability of the institution of higher education are met;
<br>
<br>(2) requires a specific description of the relationship between a main campus of an institution of higher education and all of its branches, including a description of the student aid processing that is performed by the main campus and that which is performed at its branches;
<br>
<br>(3) requires—
<br>
<br>(A) a description of the third party servicers of an institution of higher education; and
<br>
<br>(B) the institution to maintain a copy of any contract with a financial aid service provider or loan servicer, and provide a copy of any such contract to the Secretary upon request;
<br>
<br>(4) requires such other information as the Secretary determines will ensure compliance with the requirements of this subchapter with respect to eligibility, accreditation, administrative capability and financial responsibility; and
<br>
<br>(5) provides, at the option of the institution, for participation in one or more of the programs under part B or D.
<br>(c) Financial responsibility standards
<br>
<br>(1) The Secretary shall determine whether an institution has the financial responsibility required by this subchapter on the basis of whether the institution is able—
<br>
<br>(A) to provide the services described in its official publications and statements;
<br>
<br>(B) to provide the administrative resources necessary to comply with the requirements of this subchapter; and
<br>
<br>(C) to meet all of its financial obligations, including (but not limited to) refunds of institutional charges and repayments to the Secretary for liabilities and debts incurred in programs administered by the Secretary.
<br>
<br>(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), if an institution fails to meet criteria prescribed by the Secretary regarding ratios that demonstrate financial responsibility, then the institution shall provide the Secretary with satisfactory evidence of its financial responsibility in accordance with paragraph (3). Such criteria shall take into account any differences in generally accepted accounting principles, and the financial statements required thereunder, that are applicable to for-profit, public, and nonprofit institutions. The Secretary shall take into account an institution's total financial circumstances in making a determination of its ability to meet the standards herein required.
<br>
<br>(3) The Secretary shall determine an institution to be financially responsible, notwithstanding the institution's failure to meet the criteria under paragraphs (1) and (2), if—
<br>
<br>(A) such institution submits to the Secretary third-party financial guarantees that the Secretary determines are reasonable, such as performance bonds or letters of credit payable to the Secretary, which third-party financial guarantees shall equal not less than one-half of the annual potential liabilities of such institution to the Secretary for funds under this subchapter, including loan obligations discharged pursuant to section 1087 of this title, and to students for refunds of institutional charges, including funds under this subchapter;
<br>
<br>(B) such institution has its liabilities backed by the full faith and credit of a State, or its equivalent;
<br>
<br>(C) such institution establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary, with the support of a financial statement audited by an independent certified public accountant in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, that the institution has sufficient resources to ensure against the precipitous closure of the institution, including the ability to meet all of its financial obligations (including refunds of institutional charges and repayments to the Secretary for liabilities and debts incurred in programs administered by the Secretary); or
<br>
<br>(D) such institution has met standards of financial responsibility, prescribed by the Secretary by regulation, that indicate a level of financial strength not less than those required in paragraph (2).
<br>
<br>(4) If an institution of higher education that provides a 2-year or 4-year program of instruction for which the institution awards an associate or baccalaureate degree fails to meet the criteria imposed by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (2), the Secretary shall waive that particular requirement for that institution if the institution demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that—
<br>
<br>(A) there is no reasonable doubt as to its continued solvency and ability to deliver quality educational services;
<br>
<br>(B) it is current in its payment of all current liabilities, including student refunds, repayments to the Secretary, payroll, and payment of trade creditors and withholding taxes; and
<br>
<br>(C) it has substantial equity in school-occupied facilities, the acquisition of which was the direct cause of its failure to meet the criteria.
<br>
<br>(5) The determination as to whether an institution has met the standards of financial responsibility provided for in paragraphs (2) and (3)(C) shall be based on an audited and certified financial statement of the institution. Such audit shall be conducted by a qualified independent organization or person in accordance with standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Such statement shall be submitted to the Secretary at the time such institution is considered for certification or recertification under this section. If the institution is permitted to be certified (provisionally or otherwise) and such audit does not establish compliance with paragraph (2), the Secretary may require that additional audits be submitted.
<br>
<br>(6)(A) The Secretary shall establish requirements for the maintenance by an institution of higher education of sufficient cash reserves to ensure repayment of any required refunds.
<br>
<br>(B) The Secretary shall provide for a process under which the Secretary shall exempt an institution of higher education from the requirements described in subparagraph (A) if the Secretary determines that the institution—
<br>
<br>(i) is located in a State that has a tuition recovery fund that ensures that the institution meets the requirements of subparagraph (A);
<br>
<br>(ii) contributes to the fund; and
<br>
<br>(iii) otherwise has legal authority to operate within the State.
<br>(d) Administrative capacity standard
<br>
<br>The Secretary is authorized—
<br>
<br>(1) to establish procedures and requirements relating to the administrative capacities of institutions of higher education, including—
<br>
<br>(A) consideration of past performance of institutions or persons in control of such institutions with respect to student aid programs; and
<br>
<br>(B) maintenance of records; and
<br>
<br>(2) to establish such other reasonable procedures as the Secretary determines will contribute to ensuring that the institution of higher education will comply with administrative capability required by this subchapter.
<br>(e) Financial guarantees from owners
<br>
<br>(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary may, to the extent necessary to protect the financial interest of the United States, require—
<br>
<br>(A) financial guarantees from an institution participating, or seeking to participate, in a program under this subchapter, or from one or more individuals who the Secretary determines, in accordance with paragraph (2), exercise substantial control over such institution, or both, in an amount determined by the Secretary to be sufficient to satisfy the institution's potential liability to the Federal Government, student assistance recipients, and other program participants for funds under this subchapter; and
<br>
<br>(B) the assumption of personal liability, by one or more individuals who exercise substantial control over such institution, as determined by the Secretary in accordance with paragraph (2), for financial losses to the Federal Government, student assistance recipients, and other program participants for funds under this subchapter, and civil and criminal monetary penalties authorized under this subchapter.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) The Secretary may determine that an individual exercises substantial control over one or more institutions participating in a program under this subchapter if the Secretary determines that—
<br>
<br>(i) the individual directly or indirectly controls a substantial ownership interest in the institution;
<br>
<br>(ii) the individual, either alone or together with other individuals, represents, under a voting trust, power of attorney, proxy, or similar agreement, one or more persons who have, individually or in combination with the other persons represented or the individual representing them, a substantial ownership interest in the institution; or
<br>
<br>(iii) the individual is a member of the board of directors, the chief executive officer, or other executive officer of the institution or of an entity that holds a substantial ownership interest in the institution.
<br>
<br>(B) The Secretary may determine that an entity exercises substantial control over one or more institutions participating in a program under this subchapter if the Secretary determines that the entity directly or indirectly holds a substantial ownership interest in the institution.
<br>
<br>(3) For purposes of this subsection, an ownership interest is defined as a share of the legal or beneficial ownership or control of, or a right to share in the proceeds of the operation of, an institution or institution's parent corporation. An ownership interest may include, but is not limited to—
<br>
<br>(A) a sole proprietorship;
<br>
<br>(B) an interest as a tenant-in-common, joint tenant, or tenant by the entireties;
<br>

<br>
<br>(D) an interest in a trust.
<br>
<br>(4) The Secretary shall not impose the requirements described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) on an institution that—

<br>(A) has not been subjected to a limitation, suspension, or termination action by the Secretary or a guaranty agency within the preceding 5 years;
<br>
<br>(B) has not had, during its 2 most recent audits of the institutions conduct of programs under this subchapter, an audit finding that resulted in the institution being required to repay an amount greater than 5 percent of the funds the institution received from programs under this subchapter for any year;
<br>
<br>(C) meets and has met, for the preceding 5 years, the financial responsibility standards under subsection (c); and
<br>
<br>(D) has not been cited during the preceding 5 years for failure to submit audits required under this subchapter in a timely fashion.
<br>
<br>(5) For purposes of section 1094(c)(1)(G) of this title, this section shall also apply to individuals or organizations that contract with an institution to administer any aspect of an institution's student assistance program under this subchapter.
<br>
<br>(6) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any individual who—
<br>
<br>(A) the Secretary determines, in accordance with paragraph (2), exercises substantial control over an institution participating in, or seeking to participate in, a program under this subchapter;
<br>
<br>(B) is required to pay, on behalf of a student or borrower, a refund of unearned institutional charges to a lender, or to the Secretary; and
<br>
<br>(C) willfully fails to pay such refund or willfully attempts in any manner to evade payment of such refund,
<br>
<br>shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be liable to the Secretary for the amount of the refund not paid, to the same extent with respect to such refund that such an individual would be liable as a responsible person for a penalty under section 6672(a) of title 26 with respect to the nonpayment of taxes.
<br>(f) Actions on applications and site visits
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall ensure that prompt action is taken by the Department on any application required under subsection (b). The personnel of the Department of Education may conduct a site visit at each institution before certifying or recertifying its eligibility for purposes of any program under this subchapter. The Secretary shall establish priorities by which institutions are to receive site visits, and shall, to the extent practicable, coordinate such visits with site visits by States, guaranty agencies, and accrediting bodies in order to eliminate duplication, and reduce administrative burden.
<br>(g) Time limitations on, and renewal of, eligibility
<br>(1) General rule
<br>
<br>After the expiration of the certification of any institution under the schedule prescribed under this section (as this section was in effect prior to October 7, 1998), or upon request for initial certification from an institution not previously certified, the Secretary may certify the eligibility for the purposes of any program authorized under this subchapter of each such institution for a period not to exceed 6 years.
<br>(2) Notification
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall notify each institution of higher education not later than 6 months prior to the date of the expiration of the institution's certification.
<br>(3) Institutions outside the United States
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall promulgate regulations regarding the recertification requirements applicable to an institution of higher education outside of the United States that meets the requirements of section 1002(a)(1)(C) of this title and received less than $500,000 in funds under part B for the most recent year for which data are available.
<br>(h) Provisional certification of institutional eligibility
<br>
<br>(1) Notwithstanding subsections (d) and (g), the Secretary may provisionally certify an institution's eligibility to participate in programs under this subchapter—
<br>
<br>(A) for not more than one complete award year in the case of an institution of higher education seeking an initial certification; and
<br>
<br>(B) for not more than 3 complete award years if—
<br>
<br>(i) the institution's administrative capability and financial responsibility is being determined for the first time;
<br>
<br>(ii) there is a complete or partial change of ownership, as defined under subsection (i), of an eligible institution; or
<br>
<br>(iii) the Secretary determines that an institution that seeks to renew its certification is, in the judgment of the Secretary, in an administrative or financial condition that may jeopardize its ability to perform its financial responsibilities under a program participation agreement.
<br>
<br>(2) Whenever the Secretary withdraws the recognition of any accrediting agency, an institution of higher education which meets the requirements of accreditation, eligibility, and certification on the day prior to such withdrawal, the Secretary may, notwithstanding the withdrawal, continue the eligibility of the institution of higher education to participate in the programs authorized by this subchapter for a period not to exceed 18 months from the date of the withdrawal of recognition.
<br>
<br>(3) If, prior to the end of a period of provisional certification under this subsection, the Secretary determines that the institution is unable to meet its responsibilities under its program participation agreement, the Secretary may terminate the institution's participation in programs under this subchapter.
<br>(i) Treatment of changes of ownership
<br>
<br>(1) An eligible institution of higher education that has had a change in ownership resulting in a change of control shall not qualify to participate in programs under this subchapter after the change in control (except as provided in paragraph (3)) unless it establishes that it meets the requirements of section 1002 of this title (other than the requirements in subsections (b)(5) and (c)(3) 1) and this section after such change in control.
<br>
<br>(2) An action resulting in a change in control may include (but is not limited to)—
<br>
<br>(A) the sale of the institution or the majority of its assets;
<br>
<br>(B) the transfer of the controlling interest of stock of the institution or its parent corporation;
<br>
<br>(C) the merger of two or more eligible institutions;
<br>
<br>(D) the division of one or more institutions into two or more institutions;
<br>
<br>(E) the transfer of the controlling interest of stock of the institutions to its parent corporation; or
<br>
<br>(F) the transfer of the liabilities of the institution to its parent corporation.
<br>
<br>(3) An action that may be treated as not resulting in a change in control includes (but is not limited to)—
<br>
<br>(A) the sale or transfer, upon the death of an owner of an institution, of the ownership interest of the deceased in that institution to a family member or to a person holding an ownership interest in that institution; or
<br>
<br>(B) another action determined by the Secretary to be a routine business practice.
<br>
<br>(4)(A) The Secretary may provisionally certify an institution seeking approval of a change in ownership based on the preliminary review by the Secretary of a materially complete application that is received by the Secretary within 10 business days of the transaction for which the approval is sought.
<br>
<br>(B) A provisional certification under this paragraph shall expire not later than the end of the month following the month in which the transaction occurred, except that if the Secretary has not issued a decision on the application for the change of ownership within that period, the Secretary may continue such provisional certification on a month-to-month basis until such decision has been issued.
<br>(j) Treatment of branches
<br>
<br>(1) A branch of an eligible institution of higher education, as defined pursuant to regulations of the Secretary, shall be certified under this subpart before it may participate as part of such institution in a program under this subchapter, except that such branch shall not be required to meet the requirements of sections 1002(b)(1)(E) and 1002(c)(1)(C) of this title prior to seeking such certification. Such branch is required to be in existence at least 2 years after the branch is certified by the Secretary as a branch campus participating in a program under this subchapter, prior to seeking certification as a main campus or free-standing institution.
<br>
<br>(2) The Secretary may waive the requirement of section 1001(a)(2) of this title for a branch that (A) is not located in a State, (B) is affiliated with an eligible institution, and (C) was participating in one or more programs under this subchapter on or before January 1, 1992.
<br>(k) Treatment of teach-outs at additional locations
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>A location of a closed institution of higher education shall be eligible as an additional location of an eligible institution of higher education, as defined pursuant to regulations of the Secretary, for the purposes of a teach-out described in section 1094(f) of this title, if such teach-out has been approved by the institution's accrediting agency.
<br>(2) Special rule
<br>
<br>An institution of higher education that conducts a teach-out through the establishment of an additional location described in paragraph (1) shall be permitted to establish a permanent additional location at a closed institution and shall not be required—
<br>
<br>(A) to meet the requirements of sections 1002(b)(1)(E) and 1002(c)(1)(C) of this title for such additional location; or
<br>
<br>(B) to assume the liabilities of the closed institution.

<br>(aa) reducing the amount of any payments otherwise due to such eligible lender from the Secretary by the amount of the penalty; or
