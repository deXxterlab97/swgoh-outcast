It is the intention of Congress that a deduction for administrative expenses may be made in any case unless the deduction would violate a treaty obligation or amount to a taking of private property for public use without just compensation in violation of the fifth amendment to the Constitution. Sales of timber under this subsection shall be based upon a consideration of the needs and best interests of the Indian owner and his heirs. The Secretary shall take into consideration, among other things, (1) the state of growth of the timber and the need for maintaining the productive capacity of the land for the benefit of the owner and his heirs, (2) the highest and best use of the land, including the advisability and practicality of devoting it to other uses for the benefit of the owner and his heirs, and (3) the present and future financial needs of the owner and his heirs.

<br>
<br>Upon the request of the owner of an undivided but unrestricted interest in land in which there are trust or restricted Indian interests, the Secretary of the Interior is authorized to include such unrestricted interest in a sale of the trust or restricted Indian interests in timber sold pursuant to this section, and to perform any functions required of him by the contract of sale for both the restricted and the unrestricted interests, including the collection and disbursement of payments for timber and the deduction from such payments of sums in lieu of administrative expenses.

<br>(e) Emergency sales
<br>
<br>The timber on any Indian land held under a trust or other patent containing restrictions on alienations may be sold by the Secretary of the Interior without the consent of the owners when in his judgment such action is necessary to prevent loss of values resulting from fire, insects, disease, windthrow, or other natural catastrophes.
<br>(f) Change in status without affecting contractual obligations
<br>
<br>A change from a trust or restricted status to an unrestricted status of any interest in timber that has been sold pursuant to this section shall not affect the obligations of the Secretary of the Interior under any contract of sale that is in effect at the time such change in status occurs.

<br>Congressional Findings and Declaration of Purposes
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 106–568, title XII, §1202, Dec. 27, 2000, 114 Stat. 2933, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(a) Findings.—Recognizing the special relationship between the United States and the Navajo Nation and its members, and the Federal responsibility to the Navajo people, Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>"(1) the third clause of section 8, Article I of the United States Constitution provides that 'The Congress shall have Power * * * to regulate Commerce * * * with Indian tribes', and, through this and other constitutional authority, Congress has plenary power over Indian affairs;
<br>
<br>"(2) Congress, through statutes, treaties, and the general course of dealing with Indian tribes, has assumed the responsibility for the protection and preservation of Indian tribes and their resources;
<br>
<br>"(3) the United States has a trust obligation to guard and preserve the sovereignty of Indian tribes in order to foster strong tribal governments, Indian self-determination, and economic self-sufficiency;
<br>
<br>"(4) pursuant to the first section of the Act of August 9, 1955 (25 U.S.C. 415), Congress conferred upon the Secretary of the Interior the power to promulgate regulations governing tribal leases and to approve tribal leases for tribes according to regulations promulgated by the Secretary;
<br>
<br>"(5) the Secretary of the Interior has promulgated the regulations described in paragraph (4) at part 162 of title 25, Code of Federal Regulations;
<br>
<br>"(6) the requirement that the Secretary approve leases for the development of Navajo trust lands has added a level of review and regulation that does not apply to the development of non-Indian land; and
<br>
<br>"(7) in the global economy of the 21st Century, it is crucial that individual leases of Navajo trust lands not be subject to Secretarial approval and that the Navajo Nation be able to make immediate decisions over the use of Navajo trust lands.
<br>
<br>"(b) Purposes.—The purposes of this title [see Short Title of 2000 Amendment note above] are as follows:
<br>
<br>"(1) To establish a streamlined process for the Navajo Nation to lease trust lands without having to obtain the approval of the Secretary of the Interior for individual leases, except leases for exploration, development, or extraction of any mineral resources.
<br>
<br>"(2) To authorize the Navajo Nation, pursuant to tribal regulations, which must be approved by the Secretary, to lease Navajo trust lands without the approval of the Secretary of the Interior for the individual leases, except leases for exploration, development, or extraction of any mineral resources.
<br>
<br>"(3) To revitalize the distressed Navajo Reservation by promoting political self-determination, and encouraging economic self-sufficiency, including economic development that increases productivity and the standard of living for members of the Navajo Nation.
<br>
<br>"(4) To maintain, strengthen, and protect the Navajo Nation's leasing power over Navajo trust lands.
<br>
<br>"(5) To ensure that the United States is faithfully executing its trust obligation to the Navajo Nation by maintaining Federal supervision through oversight of and record keeping related to leases of Navajo Nation tribal trust lands."

<br>§416a. Lease provisions

<br>(c) Binding arbitration of disputes
<br>
<br>Any contract, including a lease, affecting land within the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Reservation may contain a provision for the binding arbitration of disputes arising out of such contract.
