The exact acreage and legal description used for purposes of the transfer shall be in accordance with a survey satisfactory to the Secretary.
<br>
<br>"(2) Any conveyance under paragraph (1) is not effective unless the deed or other instrument of conveyance contains the conditions specified in subsection (d); the instrument specifies that the United States and the State of Louisiana agree to such conditions; and the instrument specifies that, if the State engages in a material breach of the conditions, title to the real property and improvements involved reverts to the United States at the election of the Secretary.
<br>
<br>"(c)(1) With respect to Federal equipment and other items of Federal personal property that are in use at the Center as of the date of the enactment of this Act [Nov. 13, 1997], the Secretary may, subject to paragraph (2), transfer to the State such items as the Secretary determines to be appropriate, if the Secretary makes the transfer under subsection (b).

<br>
<br>"(3) The relocation of patients from the transferred property will be completed not later than 3 years after the date on which the transfer is made, except to the extent the Secretary determines that relocating particular patients is not feasible.

<br>
<br>"(4)(A) With respect to projects to make repairs and energy-related improvements at the transferred property, the Secretary will provide for the completion of all such projects for which contracts have been awarded and appropriations have been made as of the date on which the transfer is made.

<br>
<br>"(i) the Secretary will transfer the amount of such excess to the State; and
<br>
<br>"(ii) the State will expend such amount for the purposes referred to in paragraph (1), which may include the renovation of facilities at the transferred property.

<br>

Such payments are to be made in a total amount equal to that portion of the normal-cost percentage (determined through the use of dynamic assumptions) of the basic pay of the individual that is allocable to such coverage and is paid for service performed during the period for which such coverage is in effect. Such amount is to be determined in accordance with chapter 84 of such title 5, is to be paid at such time and in such manner as mutually agreed by the State and the Office of Personnel Management, and is in lieu of individual or agency contributions otherwise required.

<br>
<br>"(B) If the individual is not eligible for such an annuity as of the date of the transfer under subsection (b) but subsequently does become eligible, then once the individual separates from the service and thereby becomes entitled to receive the annuity, the pay differential shall be included in the computation of the annuity if the individual separated from the service not later than the expiration of the 90-day period beginning on the date on which the individual first became eligible for the annuity.
<br>
<br>"(C) For purposes of this paragraph, the individual is eligible for the annuity if the individual meets all conditions under such section 8336 or 8412 to be entitled to the annuity, except the condition that the individual be separated from the service.
<br>
<br>"(4) With respect to individuals who as of the date of the enactment of this Act are Federal employees with positions at the Center and are not, for duty at the center, receiving the pay differential under section 208(e) of the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 210(e)] or under section 5545(d) of title 5, United States Code:
<br>
<br>"(A) During the calendar years 1997 and 1998, the Secretary may in accordance with this paragraph provide to any such individual a voluntary separation incentive payment. The purpose of such payments is to avoid or minimize the need for involuntary separations under a reduction in force with respect to the Center.
<br>
<br>"(B) During calendar year 1997, any payment under subparagraph (A) shall be made under section 663 of the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act, 1997 (as contained in section 101(f) of division A of Public Law 104–208) [5 U.S.C. 5597 note], except that, for purposes of this subparagraph, subsection (b) of such section 663 does not apply.
<br>
<br>"(C) During calendar year 1998, such section 663 applies with respect to payments under subparagraph (A) to the same extent and in the same manner as such section applied with respect to the payments during fiscal year 1997, and for purposes of this subparagraph, the reference in subsection (c)(2)(D) of such section 663 to December 31, 1997, is deemed to be a reference to December 31, 1998.
<br>
<br>"(f) The following provisions apply if under subsection (a) the Secretary makes the decision to relocate the Center:
<br>
<br>"(1) The site to which the Center is relocated shall be in the vicinity of Baton Rouge, in the State of Louisiana.
<br>
<br>"(2) The facility involved shall continue to be designated as the National Hansen's Disease Programs Center.
<br>
<br>"(3) The Secretary shall make reasonable efforts to inform the patients of the Center with respect to the planning and carrying out of the relocation.

<br>"(4) In the case of each individual who as of October 1, 1996, was a patient of the Center and is considered by the Director of the Center to be a long-term-care patient (referred to in this subsection as an 'eligible patient'), the Secretary shall continue to provide for the long-term care of the eligible patient, without charge, for the remainder of the life of the patient.
<br>
<br>"(5)(A) For purposes of paragraph (4), an eligible patient who is legally competent has the following options with respect to support and maintenance and other nonmedical expenses:
<br>
<br>"(i) For the remainder of his or her life, the patient may reside at the Center.
<br>
<br>"(ii) For the remainder of his or her life, the patient may receive payments each year at an annual rate of $33,000 (adjusted in accordance with subparagraphs (C) and (D)), and may not reside at the Center. Payments under this clause are in complete discharge of the obligation of the Federal Government under paragraph (4) for support and maintenance and other nonmedical expenses of the patient.
<br>
<br>"(B) The choice by an eligible patient of the option under clause (i) of subparagraph (A) may at any time be revoked by the patient, and the patient may instead choose the option under clause (ii) of such subparagraph. The choice by an eligible patient of the option under such clause (ii) is irrevocable.
<br>
<br>"(C) Payments under subparagraph (A)(ii) shall be made on a monthly basis, and shall be pro rated as applicable. In 1999 and each subsequent year, the monthly amount of such payments shall be increased by a percentage equal to any percentage increase taking effect under section 215(i) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 415(i)] (relating to a cost-of-living increase) for benefits under title II of such Act [42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.] (relating to Federal old-age, survivors, and disability insurance benefits). Any such percentage increase in monthly payments under subparagraph (A)(ii) shall take effect in the same month as the percentage increase under such section 215(i) takes effect.
<br>
<br>"(D) With respect to the provision of outpatient and inpatient medical care for Hansen's disease and related complications to an eligible patient:
<br>
<br>"(i) The choice the patient makes under subparagraph (A) does not affect the responsibility of the Secretary for providing to the patient such care at or through the Center.
<br>
<br>"(ii) If the patient chooses the option under subparagraph (A)(ii) and receives inpatient care at or through the Center, the Secretary may reduce the amount of payments under such subparagraph, except to the extent that reimbursement for the expenses of such care is available to the provider of the care through the program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.] or the program under title XIX of such Act [42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.]. Any such reduction shall be made on the basis of the number of days for which the patient received the inpatient care.
<br>
<br>"(6) The Secretary shall provide to each eligible patient such information and time as may be necessary for the patient to make an informed decision regarding the options under paragraph (5)(A).
<br>
<br>"(7) After the date of the enactment of this Act [Nov. 13, 1997], the Center may not provide long-term care for any individual who as of such date was not receiving such care as a patient of the Center.
<br>
<br>"(8) If upon completion of the projects referred to in subsection (d)(4)(A) there are unobligated balances of amounts appropriated for the projects, such balances are available to the Secretary for expenses relating to the relocation of the Center, except that, if the sum of such balances is in excess of $100,000, such excess is available to the State in accordance with subsection (d)(4)(B). The amounts available to the Secretary pursuant to the preceding sentence are available until expended.
