<br>
<br>"(v) the necessary technological infrastructure to process the passport cards has been installed, and all employees at ports of entry have been properly trained in the use of the new technology;
<br>
<br>"(vi) the passport card has been made available for the purpose of international travel by United States citizens through land and sea ports of entry between the United States and Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean and Bermuda;
<br>
<br>"(vii) a single implementation date for sea and land borders has been established; and
<br>
<br>"(viii) the signing of a memorandum of agreement to initiate a pilot program with not less than one State to determine if an enhanced driver's license, which is machine-readable and tamper proof, not valid for certification of citizenship for any purpose other than admission into the United States from Canada or Mexico, and issued by such State to an individual, may permit the individual to use the driver's license to meet the documentation requirements under subparagraph (A) for entry into the United States from Canada or Mexico at land and sea ports of entry.
<br>
<br>"(C) Report.—Not later than 180 days after the initiation of the pilot program described in subparagraph (B)(viii), the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of State shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report which includes—
<br>
<br>"(i) an analysis of the impact of the pilot program on national security;
<br>

<br>"(iv) a plan to screen individuals participating in the pilot program against United States terrorist watch lists; and
<br>
<br>"(v) a recommendation for the type of machine-readable technology that should be used in enhanced driver's licenses, based on individual privacy considerations and the costs and feasibility of incorporating any new technology into existing driver's licenses.
<br>
<br>"(2) Requirement to produce documentation.—The plan developed under paragraph (1) shall require all United States citizens, and categories of individuals for whom documentation requirements have previously been waived under section 212(d)(4)(B) of such Act [8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(4)(B)], to carry and produce the documentation described in paragraph (1) when traveling from foreign countries into the United States.

<br>
<br>"(2) the President may not exercise discretion under section 215(b) of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1185(b)) to waive documentary requirements for United States citizens departing from or entering, or attempting to depart from or enter, the United States except—
<br>
<br>"(A) where the Secretary of Homeland Security determines that the alternative documentation that is the basis for the waiver of the documentary requirement is sufficient to denote identity and citizenship;
<br>
<br>"(B) in the case of an unforeseen emergency in individual cases; or
<br>
<br>"(C) in the case of humanitarian or national interest reasons in individual cases.
<br>
<br>"(d) Transit Without Visa Program.—The Secretary of State shall not use any authorities granted under section 212(d)(4)(C) of such Act [8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(4)(C)] until the Secretary, in conjunction with the Secretary of Homeland Security, completely implements a security plan to fully ensure secure transit passage areas to prevent aliens proceeding in immediate and continuous transit through the United States from illegally entering the United States."

<br>(D) Hearing in removal proceeding
<br>
<br>Any alien whose permanent resident status is terminated under subparagraph (C) may request a review of such determination in a proceeding to remove the alien. In such proceeding, the burden of proof shall be on the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the facts and information described in subsection (d)(1) and alleged in the petition are not true with respect to the qualifying marriage.
<br>(4) Hardship waiver
<br>
<br>The Secretary of Homeland Security, in the Secretary's discretion, may remove the conditional basis of the permanent resident status for an alien who fails to meet the requirements of paragraph (1) if the alien demonstrates that—
<br>
<br>(A) extreme hardship would result if such alien is removed;
<br>
<br>(B) the qualifying marriage was entered into in good faith by the alien spouse, but the qualifying marriage has been terminated (other than through the death of the spouse) and the alien was not at fault in failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1); or
<br>
<br>(C) the qualifying marriage was entered into in good faith by the alien spouse and during the marriage the alien spouse or child was battered by or was the subject of extreme cruelty perpetrated by his or her spouse or citizen or permanent resident parent and the alien was not at fault in failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1); or
<br>
<br>(D) the alien meets the requirements under section 1154(a)(1)(A)(iii)(II)(aa)(BB) of this title and following the marriage ceremony was battered by or subject to extreme cruelty perpetrated by the alien's intended spouse and was not at fault in failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1).
<br>
<br>In determining extreme hardship, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall consider circumstances occurring only during the period that the alien was admitted for permanent residence on a conditional basis. In acting on applications under this paragraph, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall consider any credible evidence relevant to the application. The determination of what evidence is credible and the weight to be given that evidence shall be within the sole discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall, by regulation, establish measures to protect the confidentiality of information concerning any abused alien spouse or child, including information regarding the whereabouts of such spouse or child.
<br>(d) Details of petition and interview
<br>(1) Contents of petition
<br>
<br>Each petition under subsection (c)(1)(A) shall contain the following facts and information:
<br>(A) Statement of proper marriage and petitioning process

<br>
<br>(II) has not been judicially annulled or terminated, other than through the death of a spouse, and
<br>
<br>(III) was not entered into for the purpose of procuring an alien's admission as an immigrant; and
<br>
<br>(ii) no fee or other consideration was given (other than a fee or other consideration to an attorney for assistance in preparation of a lawful petition) for the filing of a petition under section 1154(a) of this title or subsection (d) or (p) 2 of section 1184 of this title with respect to the alien spouse or alien son or daughter.

<br>
<br>(ii) the place of employment (if any) of each such party since such date, and the name of the employer of such party.
<br>(2) Period for filing petition
<br>(A) 90-day period before second anniversary
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the petition under subsection (c)(1)(A) must be filed during the 90-day period before the second anniversary of the alien's obtaining the status of lawful admission for permanent residence.
<br>(B) Date petitions for good cause
<br>
<br>Such a petition may be considered if filed after such date, but only if the alien establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary of Homeland Security good cause and extenuating circumstances for failure to file the petition during the period described in subparagraph (A).
<br>(C) Filing of petitions during removal
<br>
<br>In the case of an alien who is the subject of removal hearings as a result of failure to file a petition on a timely basis in accordance with subparagraph (A), the Secretary of Homeland Security may stay such removal proceedings against an alien pending the filing of the petition under subparagraph (B).

The Secretary of Homeland Security, in the Secretary's discretion, may waive the deadline for such an interview or the requirement for such an interview in such cases as may be appropriate.
<br>(e) Treatment of period for purposes of naturalization
<br>
<br>For purposes of subchapter III, in the case of an alien who is in the United States as a lawful permanent resident on a conditional basis under this section, the alien shall be considered to have been admitted as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence and to be in the United States as an alien lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence.
<br>(f) Treatment of certain waivers
<br>
<br>In the case of an alien who has permanent residence status on a conditional basis under this section, if, in order to obtain such status, the alien obtained a waiver under subsection (h) or (i) of section 1182 of this title of certain grounds of inadmissibility, such waiver terminates upon the termination of such permanent residence status under this section.
