<br>13I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the poor,
<br>And the right of the needy.
<br>14Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto Thy name;
<br>The upright shall dwell in Thy presence.

<br>They have spread a net by the wayside;
<br> 
<br>141
<br> 
<br>A Psalm of David.
<br> 
<br>They have set gins for me.	Selah
<br> 
<br>LORD, I have called Thee; make haste unto me;
<br> 
<br>Give ear unto my voice, when I call unto Thee.
<br> 
<br>Whilst I withal escape.
<br> 
<br>2Let my prayer be set forth as incense before Thee,
<br>The lifting up of my hands as the

<br>142
<br> 
<br>Maschil of David, when he was in the cave; a Prayer.
<br> 
<br>evening sacrifice.
<br>3Set a guard, O LORD, to my mouth; Keep watch at the door of my lips. 4Incline not my heart to any evil
<br>thing,
<br>To be occupied in deeds of wickedness
<br>With men that work iniquity;
<br>And let me not eat of their dainties.
<br>
<br>5Let the righteous smite me in kindness, and correct me;
<br>Oil so choice let not my head refuse;
<br>For still is my prayer because of their wickedness.
<br>6Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock;
<br>And they shall hear my words, that they are sweet.
<br>7As when one cleaveth and breaketh up the earth,
<br>Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth.
<br>
<br>8For mine eyes are unto Thee, O GOD the Lord;
<br>In Thee have I taken refuge, O pour not out my soul.
<br>9Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me,
<br>And from the gins of the workers of
<br>iniquity.
<br> 
<br>2With my voice I cry unto the LORD;
<br>With my voice I make supplication unto the LORD.
<br>3I pour out my complaint before Him,
<br>I declare before Him my trouble;
<br>4When my spirit fainteth within me—
<br>Thou knowest my path— In the way wherein I walk
<br>Have they hidden a snare for me.
<br>5Look on my right hand, and see,
<br>For there is no man that knoweth me;
<br>I have no way to flee;
<br>No man careth for my soul.
<br>
<br>6I have cried unto Thee, O LORD; I have said: 'Thou art my refuge,
<br>My portion in the land of the living.'
<br>7Attend unto my cry;
<br>For I am brought very low; Deliver me from my persecutors; For they are too strong for me.
<br>8Bring my soul out of prison,
<br>That I may give thanks unto Thy name;
<br>The righteous shall crown themselves because of me;
<br>For Thou wilt deal bountifully with me.
<br> 
<br>10Let the wicked fall into their own nets,
<br> 
<br>143
<br> 
<br>A Psalm of David.
<br> 
<br>O LORD, hear my prayer, give ear to my supplications;
<br>In Thy faithfulness answer me, and in Thy righteousness.
<br>2And enter not into judgment with Thy servant;
<br>For in Thy sight shall no man living be justified.
<br>
<br>3For the enemy hath persecuted my soul;
<br>He hath crushed my life down to the ground;
<br>He hath made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead.
<br>4And my spirit fainteth within me;
<br> 
<br>9Deliver me from mine enemies, O LORD;
<br>With Thee have I hidden myself.
<br>10Teach me to do Thy will, For Thou art my God;
<br>Let Thy good spirit
<br>Lead me in an even land.
<br>11For Thy name's sake, O LORD, quicken me;
<br>In Thy righteousness bring my soul out of trouble.
<br>12And in Thy mercy cut off mine enemies,
<br>And destroy all them that harass my soul;
<br>For I am Thy servant.
<br> 
<br>My heart within me is appalled.
<br> 
<br>144
<br> 
<br>[A Psalm] of David.
<br> 
<br>5I remember the days of old; I meditate on all Thy doing;
<br>I muse on the work of Thy hands.
<br>6I spread forth my hands unto Thee;
<br>My soul [thirsteth] after Thee, as a weary land.	Selah
<br>
<br>7Answer me speedily, O LORD, My spirit faileth;
<br>Hide not Thy face from me;
<br>Lest I become like them that go down into the pit.
<br>8Cause me to hear Thy lovingkindness in the morning,
<br>For in Thee do I trust;
<br>Cause me to know the way wherein I should walk,
<br>For unto Thee have I lifted up my soul.
<br> 
<br>Blessed be the LORD my Rock, Who traineth my hands for war, And my fingers for battle;
<br>2My lovingkindness, and my fortress,
<br>My high tower, and my deliverer;
<br>My shield, and He in whom I take refuge;
<br>Who subdueth my people under me.
<br>
<br>3LORD, what is man, that Thou takest knowledge of him?
<br>Or the son of man, that Thou makest account of him?
<br>4Man is like unto a breath;
<br>His days are as a shadow that passeth away.
<br>5O LORD, bow Thy heavens, and come down;
<br> 
<br>Touch the mountains, that they may smoke.
<br>6Cast forth lightning, and scatter them;
<br>Send out Thine arrows, and discomfit them.
<br> 
<br>And no outcry in our broad places;
<br>15Happy is the people that is in such a case.
<br>Yea, happy is the people whose God is the LORD.
<br> 
<br>7Stretch forth Thy hands from on high;
<br>Rescue me, and deliver me out of
<br> 
<br>145
<br> 
<br>[A Psalm of] praise; of David.

<br>many waters,
<br>Out of the hand of strangers;
<br>8Whose mouth speaketh falsehood,
<br>And their right hand is a right hand of lying.
<br>
<br>9O God, I will sing a new song unto Thee,
<br>Upon a psaltery of ten strings will I sing praises unto Thee;
<br>10Who givest salvation unto kings,
<br>Who rescuest David Thy servant from the hurtful sword.
<br>11Rescue me, and deliver me out of the hand of strangers,
<br>Whose mouth speaketh falsehood,
<br>And their right hand is a right hand of lying.
<br>
<br>12We whose sons are as plants grown up in their youth; Whose daughters are as corner-
<br>pillars carved after the fashion of a palace;
<br>13Whose garners are full, affording all manner of store;
<br>Whose sheep increase by thousands and ten thousands in our fields;
<br>14Whose oxen are well laden;
<br>With no breach, and no going forth,
<br> 
<br>א I will extol Thee, my God, O King;
<br>And I will bless Thy name for ever and ever.
<br>ב 2Every day will I bless Thee;
<br>And I will praise Thy name for ever and ever.
<br>ג 3Great is the LORD, and highly to be praised;
<br>And His greatness is unsearchable.
<br>ד 4One generation shall laud Thy works to another,
<br>And shall declare Thy mighty acts.
<br>ה 5The glorious splendour of Thy majesty,
<br>And Thy wondrous works, will I rehearse.
<br>ו 6And men shall speak of the might of Thy tremendous acts;
<br>And I will tell of Thy greatness.
<br>ז 7They shall utter the fame of Thy great goodness,
<br>And shall sing of Thy righteousness.
<br>ח 8The LORD is gracious, and full of compassion;
<br>Slow to anger, and of great mercy.
<br>ט 9The LORD is good to all;
<br> 
<br>And His tender mercies are over all His works.
<br>י 10All Thy works shall praise Thee, O LORD;
<br>And Thy saints shall bless Thee.
<br>כ 11They shall speak of the glory of Thy kingdom,
<br>And talk of Thy might;
<br> 
<br>ש 20The LORD preserveth all them that love Him;
<br>But all the wicked will He destroy.
<br>ת 21My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD;
<br>And let all flesh bless His holy name for ever and ever.
<br> 
<br>ל 12To make known to the sons of men His mighty acts,
<br> 
<br>146
<br> 
<br>Hallelujah.
<br>Praise the LORD, O my soul.
<br> 
<br>And the glory of the majesty of His kingdom.
<br>מ 13Thy kingdom is a kingdom for all ages,
<br>And Thy dominion endureth throughout all generations.
<br>ס 14The LORD upholdeth all that fall,
<br>And raiseth up all those that are bowed down.
<br>ע 15The eyes of all wait for Thee,
<br>And Thou givest them their food in due season.
<br>פ 16Thou openest Thy hand,
<br>And satisfiest every living thing with favour.
<br>צ 17The LORD is righteous in all His ways,
<br>And gracious in all His works.
<br>ק 18The LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon Him,
<br>To all that call upon Him in truth.
<br>ר 19He will fulfil the desire of them that fear Him;
<br>He also will hear their cry, and will save them.
<br> 
<br>2I will praise the LORD while I live;
<br>I will sing praises unto my God while I have my being.
<br>
<br>3Put not your trust in princes,
<br>Nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.
<br>4His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his dust;
<br>In that very day his thoughts perish.
<br>5Happy is he whose help is the God of Jacob,
<br>Whose hope is in the LORD his God,
<br>6Who made heaven and earth, The sea, and all that in them is; Who keepeth truth for ever; 7Who executeth justice for the
<br>oppressed;
<br>Who giveth bread to the hungry.
<br>
<br>The LORD looseth the prisoners;
<br>8The LORD openeth the eyes of the blind;
<br>The LORD raiseth up them that are bowed down;
<br>The LORD loveth the righteous;
<br>9The LORD preserveth the strangers;
<br>He upholdeth the fatherless and the widow;
<br> 
<br>But the way of the wicked He maketh crooked.
<br>10The LORD will reign for ever,
<br>Thy God, O Zion, unto all generations.
<br>Hallelujah.
<br> 
<br>He taketh no pleasure in the legs of a man.
<br>11The LORD taketh pleasure in them that fear Him,
<br>In those that wait for His mercy.
<br>
<br>12Glorify the LORD, O Jerusalem;
<br> 
<br>147
<br> 
<br>Hallelujah;
<br>For it is good to sing praises unto our God;
<br> 
<br>Praise thy God, O Zion.
<br>13For He hath made strong the bars of thy gates;
<br> 
<br>For it is pleasant, and praise is comely.
<br>2The LORD doth build up Jerusalem,
<br>He gathereth together the dispersed of Israel;
<br>3Who healeth the broken in heart, And bindeth up their wounds.
<br>4He counteth the number of the stars;
<br>He giveth them all their names.
<br>5Great is our Lord, and mighty in power;
<br>His understanding is infinite.
<br>6The LORD upholdeth the humble;
<br>He bringeth the wicked down to the ground.
<br>7Sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving,
<br>Sing praises upon the harp unto our God;
<br>8Who covereth the heaven with clouds,
<br>Who prepareth rain for the earth,
<br>Who maketh the mountains to spring with grass.
<br>9He giveth to the beast his food, And to the young ravens which cry.
<br> 
<br>He hath blessed thy children within thee.
<br>14He maketh thy borders peace;
<br>He giveth thee in plenty the fat of wheat.
<br>15He sendeth out His commandment upon earth;
<br>His word runneth very swiftly.
<br>16He giveth snow like wool;
<br>He scattereth the hoar-frost like ashes.
<br>17He casteth forth His ice like crumbs;
<br>Who can stand before His cold?
<br>18He sendeth forth His word, and melteth them;
<br>He causeth His wind to blow, and the waters flow.
<br>19He declareth His word unto Jacob, His statutes and His ordinances unto
<br>Israel.
<br>20He hath not dealt so with any nation;
<br>And as for His ordinances, they have not known them.
<br>Hallelujah.
<br> 
<br>10He delighteth not in the strength of the horse;
<br> 
<br>148
<br> 
<br>Hallelujah.
<br>Praise ye the LORD from the
<br> 
<br>heavens; Praise Him in the heights.
<br>2Praise ye Him, all His angels; Praise ye Him, all His hosts.
<br> 
<br>Even for the children of Israel, a people near unto Him.
<br>Hallelujah.
<br> 
<br>3Praise ye Him, sun and moon; Praise Him, all ye stars of light. 4Praise Him, ye heavens of heavens,
<br> 
<br>149
<br> 
<br>Hallelujah.
<br>Sing unto the LORD a new song,
<br> 
<br>And ye waters that are above the heavens.
<br>5Let them praise the name of the LORD;
<br>For He commanded, and they were created.
<br>6He hath also established them for ever and ever;
<br>He hath made a decree which shall not be transgressed.
<br>
<br>7Praise the LORD from the earth, Ye sea-monsters, and all deeps; 8Fire and hail, snow and vapour, Stormy wind, fulfilling His word; 9Mountains and all hills,
<br>Fruitful trees and all cedars;
<br>10Beasts and all cattle,
<br>Creeping things and winged fowl; 11Kings of the earth and all peoples, Princes and all judges of the earth; 12Both young men and maidens, Old men and children;
<br>13Let them praise the name of the LORD,
<br>For His name alone is exalted;
<br>His glory is above the earth and heaven.
<br>14And He hath lifted up a horn for His people,
<br>A praise for all His saints,
<br> 
<br>And His praise in the assembly of the saints.
<br>2Let Israel rejoice in his Maker;
<br>Let the children of Zion be joyful in their King.
<br>3Let them praise His name in the dance;
<br>Let them sing praises unto Him with the timbrel and harp.
<br>4For the LORD taketh pleasure in His people;
<br>He adorneth the humble with salvation.
<br>
<br>5Let the saints exult in glory;
<br>Let them sing for joy upon their beds.
<br>6Let the high praises of God be in their mouth,
<br>And a two-edged sword in their hand;
<br>7To execute vengeance upon the nations,
<br>And chastisements upon the peoples;
<br>8To bind their kings with chains, And their nobles with fetters of iron; 9To execute upon them the
<br>judgment written;
<br>He is the glory of all His saints. Hallelujah.

<br>3Praise Him with the blast of the horn;
<br>Praise Him with the psaltery and harp.
<br> 
<br>Praise Him with stringed instruments and the pipe.
<br>5Praise Him with the loud-sounding cymbals;
<br>Praise Him with the clanging cymbals.
<br>6Let every thing that hath breath praise the LORD.

<br> 
<br>משלי
<br>PROVERBS
<br> 
<br>The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;
<br>2To know wisdom and instruction;
<br>To comprehend the words of understanding;
<br>3To receive the discipline of wisdom,
<br>Justice, and right, and equity;
<br>4To give prudence to the simple,
<br>To the young man knowledge and discretion;
<br>5That the wise man may hear, and increase in learning,
<br>And the man of understanding may attain unto wise counsels;
<br>6To understand a proverb, and a figure;
<br>The words of the wise, and their dark sayings.
<br>
<br>7The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge;
<br>But the foolish despise wisdom and discipline.
<br>
<br>8Hear, my son, the instruction of thy father,
<br>And forsake not the teaching of thy mother;
<br>9For they shall be a chaplet of grace unto thy head,
<br>And chains about thy neck.
<br>
<br>10My son, if sinners entice thee,
<br> 
<br>Consent thou not.
<br>11If they say: ‘Come with us, Let us lie in wait for blood,
<br>Let us lurk for the innocent without cause;
<br>12Let us swallow them up alive as the grave,
<br>And whole, as those that go down into the pit;
<br>13We shall find all precious substance,
<br>We shall fill our houses with spoil;
<br>14Cast in thy lot among us; Let us all have one purse’—
<br>15My son, walk not thou in the way with them,
<br>Restrain thy foot from their path;
<br>16For their feet run to evil,
<br>A nd they make haste to shed blood.
<br>17For in vain the net is spread In the eyes of any bird;
<br>18And these lie in wait for their own blood,
<br>They lurk for their own lives.
<br>19So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain;
<br>It taketh away the life of the owners thereof.
<br>
<br>20Wisdom crieth aloud in the streets,
<br>She uttereth her voice in the broad places;
<br>21She calleth at the head of the noisy streets,
<br> 
<br>At the entrances of the gates, in the city, she uttereth her words:
<br>22’How long, ye thoughtless, will ye love thoughtlessness?
<br>And how long will scorners delight them in scorning,
<br>And fools hate knowledge?
<br>23Turn you at my reproof;
<br>Behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you,
<br>I will make known my words unto you.
<br>24Because I have called, and ye refused,
<br>I have stretched out my hand, and no man attended,
<br>25But ye have set at nought all my counsel,
<br>And would none of my reproof;
<br>26I also, in your calamity, will laugh,
<br>I will mock when your dread cometh;
<br>27When your dread cometh as a storm,
<br>And your calamity cometh on as a whirlwind;
<br>When trouble and distress come upon you.
<br>28Then will they call me, but I will not answer,
<br>They will seek me earnestly, but they shall not find me.
<br>29For that they hated knowledge, And did not choose the fear of the
<br>LORD;
<br>30They would none of my counsel, They despised all my reproof.
<br>31Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way,
<br> 
<br>And be filled with their own devices.
<br>32For the waywardness of the thoughtless shall slay them,
<br>And the confidence of fools shall destroy them.
<br>33But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell securely,
<br>And shall be quiet without fear of evil.’
<br>
<br>My son, if thou wilt receive my words,
<br>And lay up my commandments with thee;
<br>2So that thou make thine ear attend unto wisdom,
<br>And thy heart incline to discernment;
<br>3Yea, if thou call for understanding,
<br>And lift up thy voice for discernment;
<br>4If thou seek her as silver,
<br>And search for her as for hid treasures;
<br>5Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD,
<br>And find the knowledge of God.
<br>6For the LORD giveth wisdom,
<br>Out of His mouth cometh knowledge and discernment;
<br>7He layeth up sound wisdom for the upright,
<br>He is a shield to them that walk in integrity;
<br>8That He may guard the paths of justice,
<br>And preserve the way of His godly ones.
<br> 
<br>9Then shalt thou understand righteousness and justice,
<br>And equity, yea, every good path.
<br>10For wisdom shall enter into thy heart,
<br>And knowledge shall be pleasant unto thy soul;
<br>11Discretion shall watch over thee, Discernment shall guard thee; 12To deliver thee from the way of
<br>evil,
<br>From the men that speak froward things;
<br>13Who leave the paths of uprightness,
<br>To walk in the ways of darkness;
<br>14Who rejoice to do evil,
<br>And delight in the frowardness of evil;
<br>15Who are crooked in their ways, And perverse in their paths;
<br>16To deliver thee from the strange woman,
<br>Even from the alien woman that maketh smooth her words; 17That forsaketh the lord of her
<br>youth,
<br>And forgetteth the covenant of her God.
<br>18For her house sinketh down unto death,
<br>And her paths unto the shades;
<br>19None that go unto her return,
<br>Neither do they attain unto the paths of life;
<br>20That thou mayest walk in the way of good men,
<br>And keep the paths of the righteous.
<br> 
<br>21For the upright shall dwell in the land,
<br>And the whole-hearted shall remain in it.
<br>22But the wicked shall be cut off from the land,
<br>And the faithless shall be plucked up out of it.
<br>
<br>My son, forget not my teaching;
<br>But let thy heart keep my commandments;
<br>2For length of days, and years of life,
<br>And peace, will they add to thee.
<br>3Let not kindness and truth forsake thee;
<br>Bind them about thy neck, write them upon the table of thy heart;
<br>4So shalt thou find grace and good favour
<br>In the sight of God and man.
<br>
<br>5Trust in the LORD with all thy heart,
<br>And lean not upon thine own understanding.
<br>6In all thy ways acknowledge Him, And He will direct thy paths.
<br>
<br>7Be not wise in thine own eyes; Fear the LORD, and depart from evil; 8It shall be health to thy navel,
<br>And marrow to thy bones.
<br>
<br>9Honour the LORD with thy substance,
<br>And with the first-fruits of all thine increase;
<br> 
<br>10So shall thy barns be filled with plenty,
<br>And thy vats shall overflow with new wine.
<br>11My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD,
<br>Neither spurn thou His correction;
<br>12For whom the LORD loveth He correcteth,
<br>Even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.
<br>
<br>13Happy is the man that findeth wisdom,
<br>And the man that obtaineth understanding.
<br>14For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver,
<br>And the gain thereof than fine gold.
<br>15She is more precious than rubies; And all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.
<br>16Length of days is in her right hand;
<br>In her left hand are riches and honour.
<br>17Her ways are ways of pleasantness,
<br>And all her paths are peace.
<br>18She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her,
<br>And happy is every one that holdest her fast.
<br>
<br>19The LORD by wisdom founded the earth;
<br>By understanding He established the heavens.
<br>20By His knowledge the depths were broken up,
<br> 
<br>And the skies drop down the dew.
<br>
<br>21My son, let not them depart from thine eyes;
<br>Keep sound wisdom and discretion; 22So shall they be life unto thy soul, And grace to thy neck.
<br>23Then shalt thou walk in thy way securely,
<br>And thou shalt not dash thy foot.
<br>24When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid;
<br>Yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.
<br>
<br>25Be not afraid of sudden terror,
<br>Neither of the destruction of the wicked, when it cometh;
<br>26For the LORD will be thy confidence,
<br>And will keep thy foot from being caught.
<br>
<br>27Withhold not good from him to whom it is due,
<br>When it is in the power of thy hand to do it.
<br>28Say not unto thy neighbour: ‘Go, and come again,
<br>And to-morrow I will give’; when thou hast it by thee.
<br>
<br>29Devise not evil against thy neighbour,
<br>Seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.
<br>30Strive not with a man without cause,
<br>If he have done thee no harm.
<br> 
<br>31Envy thou not the man of violence, And choose none of his ways.
<br>32For the perverse is an abomination to the LORD;
<br>But His counsel is with the upright.
<br>
<br>33The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked;
<br>But He blesseth the habitation of the righteous.
<br>34If it concerneth the scorners, He scorneth them,
<br>But unto the humble He giveth grace.
<br>35The wise shall inherit honour;
<br>But as for the fools, they carry away shame.
<br>
<br>Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father,
<br>And attend to know understanding. 2For I give you good doctrine; Forsake ye not my teaching.
<br>3For I was a son unto my father,
<br>Tender and an only one in the sight of my mother.
<br>4And he taught me, and said unto me:
<br>‘Let thy heart hold fast my words, Keep my commandments, and live; 5Get wisdom, get understanding;
<br>Forget not, neither decline from the words of my mouth;
<br>6Forsake her not, and she will preserve thee;
<br>Love her, and she will keep thee.
<br>7The beginning of wisdom is: Get wisdom;
<br> 
<br>Yea, with all thy getting get understanding.
<br>8Extol her, and she will exalt thee;
<br>She will bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.
<br>9She will give to thy head a chaplet of grace;
<br>A crown of glory will she bestow on thee.’
<br>10Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings;
<br>And the years of thy life shall be many.
<br>11I have taught thee in the way of wisdom;
<br>I have led thee in paths of uprightness.
<br>12When thou goest, thy step shall not be straitened;
<br>And if thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.
<br>13Take fast hold of instruction, let her not go;
<br>Keep her, for she is thy life.
<br>
<br>14Enter not into the path of the wicked,
<br>And walk not in the way of evil men.
<br>15Avoid it, pass not by it; Turn from it, and pass on.
<br>16For they sleep not, except they have done evil;
<br>And their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.
<br>17For they eat the bread of wickedness,
<br>And drink the wine of violence.
<br> 
<br>18But the path of the righteous is as the light of dawn,
<br>That shineth more and more unto the perfect day.
<br>19The way of the wicked is as darkness;
<br>They know not at what they stumble.
<br>
<br>20My son, attend to my words; Incline thine ear unto my sayings. 21Let them not depart from thine
<br>eyes;
<br>Keep them in the midst of thy heart.
<br>22For they are life unto those that find them,
<br>And health to all their flesh.
<br>23Above all that thou guardest keep thy heart;
<br>For out of it are the issues of life.
<br>24Put away from thee a froward mouth,
<br>And perverse lips put far from thee.
<br>25Let thine eyes look right on,
<br>And let thine eyelids look straight before thee.
<br>26Make plain the path of thy feet, And let all thy ways be established. 27Turn not to the right hand nor to
<br>the left;
<br>Remove thy foot from evil.
<br>
<br>My son, attend unto my wisdom;
<br>Incline thine ear to my understanding;
<br>2That thou mayest preserve discretion,
<br>And that thy lips may keep knowledge.
<br> 
<br>3For the lips of a strange woman drop honey,
<br>And her mouth is smoother than oil; 4But her end is bitter as wormwood, Sharp as a two-edged sword.
<br>5Her feet go down to death;
<br>Her steps take hold on the nether- world;
<br>6Lest she should walk the even path of life,
<br>Her ways wander, but she knoweth it not.
<br>
<br>7Now therefore, O ye children, hearken unto me,
<br>And depart not from the words of my mouth.
<br>8Remove thy way far from her,
<br>And come not nigh the door of her house;
<br>9Lest thou give thy vigour unto others,
<br>And thy years unto the cruel;
<br>10Lest strangers be filled with thy strength,
<br>And thy labours be in the house of an alien;
<br>11And thou moan, when thine end cometh,
<br>When thy flesh and thy body are consumed,
<br>12And say: ‘How have I hated instruction,
<br>And my heart despised reproof;
<br>13Neither have I hearkened to the voice of my teachers,
<br>Nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!
<br>14I was well nigh in all evil
<br> 
<br>In the midst of the congregation and assembly.’
<br>
<br>15Drink waters out of thine own cistern,
<br>And running waters out of thine own well.
<br>16Let thy springs be dispersed abroad,
<br>And courses of water in the streets.
<br>17Let them be only thine own, And not strangers’with thee. 18Let thy fountain be blessed;
<br>And have joy of the wife of thy youth.
<br>19A lovely hind and a graceful doe,
<br>Let her breasts satisfy thee at all times;
<br>With her love be thou ravished always.
<br>20Why then wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman,
<br>And embrace the bosom of an alien?
<br>
<br>21For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD,
<br>And He maketh even all his paths.
<br>22His own iniquities shall ensnare the wicked,
<br>And he shall be holden with the cords of his sin.
<br>23He shall die for lack of instruction;
<br>And in the greatness of his folly he shall reel.
<br>
<br>My son, if thou art become surety for thy neighbour,
<br>If thou hast struck thy hands for a stranger—
<br> 
<br>2Thou art snared by the words of thy mouth,
<br>Thou art caught by the words of thy mouth—
<br>3Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself,
<br>Seeing thou art come into the hand of thy neighbour;
<br>Go, humble thyself, and urge thy neighbour.
<br>4Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.
<br>5Deliver thyself as a gazelle from the hand [of the hunter],
<br>And as a bird from the hand of the fowler.
<br>
<br>6Go to the ant, thou sluggard; Consider her ways, and be wise; 7Which having no chief, Overseer, or ruler,
<br>8Provideth her bread in the summer,
<br>And gatherest her food in the harvest.
<br>9How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard?
<br>When wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?
<br>10’Yet a little sleep, a little slumber,
<br>A little folding of the hands to sleep’—
<br>11So shall thy poverty come as a runner,
<br>And thy want as an armed man.
<br>
<br>12A base person, a man of iniquity,
<br>Is he that walketh with a froward mouth;
<br> 
<br>13That winketh with his eyes, that scrapeth with his feet,
<br>That pointeth with his fingers;
<br>14Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth evil continually;
<br>He soweth discord.
<br>15Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly;
<br>On a sudden shall he be broken, and that without remedy.
<br>
<br>16There are six things which the LORD hateth,
<br>Yea, seven which are an abomination unto Him:
<br>17Haughty eyes, a lying tongue,
<br>And hands that shed innocent blood;
<br>18A heart that deviseth wicked thoughts,
<br>Feet that are swift in running to evil;
<br>19A false witness that breatheth out lies,
<br>And he that soweth discord among brethren.
<br>
<br>20My son, keep the commandment of thy father,
<br>And forsake not the teaching of thy mother;
<br>21Bind them continually upon thy heart,
<br>Tie them about thy neck.
<br>22When thou walkest, it shall lead thee,
<br>When thou liest down, it shall watch over thee;
<br>And when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.
<br> 
<br>23For the commandment is a lamp, and the teaching is light,
<br>And reproofs of instruction are the way of life;
<br>24To keep thee from the evil woman,
<br>From the smoothness of the alien tongue.
<br>25Lust not after her beauty in thy heart;
<br>Neither let her captivate thee with her eyelids.
<br>26For on account of a harlot a man is brought to a loaf of bread,
<br>But the adulteress hunteth for the precious life.
<br>27Can a man take fire in his bosom, And his clothes not be burned?
<br>28Or can one walk upon hot coals, And his feet not be scorched?
<br>29So he that goeth in to his neighbour’s wife;
<br>Whosoever toucheth her shall not go unpunished.
<br>30Men do not despise a thief, if he steal
<br>To satisfy his soul when he is hungry;
<br>31But if he be found, he must restore sevenfold,
<br>He must give all the substance of his house.
<br>32He that committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding;
<br>He doeth it that would destroy his own soul.
<br>33Wounds and dishonour shall he get,
<br>And his reproach shall not be wiped away.
<br> 
<br>34For jealousy is the rage of a man,
<br>And he will not spare in the day of vengeance.
<br>35He will not regard any ransom;
<br>Neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.
<br>
<br>My son, keep my words,
<br>And lay up my commandments with thee.
<br>2Keep my commandments and live,
<br>And my teaching as the apple of thine eye.
<br>3Bind them upon thy fingers,
<br>Write them upon the table of thy heart.
<br>4Say unto wisdom: ‘Thou art my sister’,
<br>And call understanding thy kinswoman;
<br>5That they may keep thee from the strange woman,
<br>From the alien woman that maketh smooth her words.
<br>
<br>6For at the window of my house I looked forth through my lattice; 7And I beheld among the
<br>thoughtless ones,
<br>I discerned among the youths,
<br>A young man void of understanding,
<br>8Passing through the street near her corner,
<br>And he went the way to her house;
<br>9In the twilight, in the evening of the day,
<br>In the blackness of night and the darkness.
<br> 
<br>10And, behold, there met him a woman
<br>With the attire of a harlot, and wily of heart.
<br>11She is riotous and rebellious, Her feet abide not in her house; 12Now she is in the streets, now in
<br>the broad places,
<br>And lieth in wait at every corner.
<br>13So she caught him, and kissed him,
<br>And with an impudent face she said unto him:
<br>14’Sacrifices of peace-offerings were due from me;
<br>This day have I paid my vows.
<br>15Therefore came I forth to meet thee,
<br>To seek thy face, and I have found thee.
<br>16I have decked my couch with coverlets,
<br>With striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt.
<br>17I have perfumed my bed
<br>With myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
<br>18Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning;
<br>Let us solace ourselves with loves. 19For my husband is not at home, He is gone a long journey;
<br>20He hath taken the bag of money with him;
<br>He will come home at the full moon.’
<br>
<br>21With her much fair speech she causeth him to yield,
<br> 
<br>With the blandishment of her lips she enticeth him away.
<br>22He goeth after her straightway,
<br>As an ox that goeth to the slaughter,
<br>Or as one in fetters to the correction of the fool;
<br>23Till an arrow strike through his liver;
<br>As a bird hasteneth to the snare—
<br>And knoweth not that it is at the cost of his life.
<br>
<br>24Now therefore, O ye children, hearken unto me,
<br>And attend to the words of my mouth.
<br>25Let not thy heart decline to her ways,
<br>Go not astray in her paths.
<br>26For she hath cast down many wounded;
<br>Yea, a mighty host are all her slain.
<br>27Her house is the way to the nether- world,
<br>Going down to the chambers of death.
<br>
<br>Doth not wisdom call,
<br>And understanding put forth her voice?
<br>2In the top of high places by the way,
<br>Where the paths meet, she standeth;
<br>3Beside the gates, at the entry of the city,
<br>At the coming in at the doors, she crieth aloud:
<br>4’Unto you, O men, I call,
<br>And my voice is to the sons of men.
<br> 
<br>5O ye thoughtless, understand prudence,
<br>And, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.
<br>6Hear, for I will speak excellent things,
<br>And the opening of my lips shall be right things.
<br>7For my mouth shall utter truth,
<br>And wickedness is an abomination to my lips.
<br>8All the words of my mouth are in righteousness,
<br>There is nothing perverse or crooked in them.
<br>9They are all plain to him that understandeth,
<br>And right to them that find knowledge.
<br>10Receive my instruction, and not silver,
<br>And knowledge rather than choice gold.
<br>11For wisdom is better than rubies,
<br>And all things desirable are not to be compared unto her.
<br>12I wisdom dwell with prudence, And find out knowledge of devices. 13The fear of the LORD is to hate evil;
<br>Pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way,
<br>And the froward mouth, do I hate.
<br>14Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom;
<br>I am understanding, power is mine.
<br>15By me kings reign,
<br>And princes decree justice.
<br>16By me princes rule,
<br> 
<br>And nobles, even all the judges of the earth.
<br>17I love them that love me,
<br>And those that seek me earnestly shall find me.
<br>18Riches and honour are with me;
<br>Yea, enduring riches and righteousness.
<br>19My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold;
<br>And my produce than choice silver. 20I walk in the way of righteousness, In the midst of the paths of justice; 21That I may cause those that love
<br>me to inherit substance,
<br>And that I may fill their treasuries.
<br>
<br>22The LORD made me as the beginning of His way,
<br>The first of His works of old.
<br>23I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning,
<br>Or ever the earth was.
<br>24When there were no depths, I was brought forth;
<br>When there were no fountains abounding with water.
<br>25Before the mountains were settled, Before the hills was I brought forth; 26While as yet He had not made the
<br>earth, nor the fields,
<br>Nor the beginning of the dust of the world.
<br>27When He established the heavens, I was there;
<br>When He set a circle upon the face of the deep,
<br>28When He made firm the skies above,
<br> 
<br>When the fountains of the deep showed their might,
<br>29When He gave to the sea His decree,
<br>That the waters should not transgress His commandment,
<br>When He appointed the foundations of the earth;
<br>30Then I was by Him, as a nursling; And I was daily all delight, Playing always before Him, 31Playing in His habitable earth,
<br>And my delights are with the sons of men.
<br>
<br>32Now therefore, ye children, hearken unto me;
<br>For happy are they that keep my ways.
<br>33Hear instruction, and be wise, And refuse it not.
<br>34Happy is the man that hearkeneth to me,
<br>Watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.
<br>35For whoso findeth me findeth life, And obtaineth favour of the LORD. 36But he that misseth me wrongeth
<br>his own soul;
<br>All they that hate me love death.’
<br>
<br>Wisdom hath builded her house,
<br>She hath hewn out her seven pillars;
<br>2She hath prepared her meat, she hath mingled her wine;
<br>She hath also furnished her table.
<br>3She hath sent forth her maidens, she calleth,
<br> 
<br>Upon the highest places of the city:
<br>4’Whoso is thoughtless, let him turn in hither’;
<br>As for him that lacketh understanding, she saith to him:
<br>5’Come, eat of my bread,
<br>And drink of the wine which I have mingled.
<br>6Forsake all thoughtlessness, and live;
<br>And walk in the way of understanding.
<br>7He that correcteth a scorner getteth to himself shame,
<br>And he that reproveth a wicked man, it becometh unto him a blot.
<br>8Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee;
<br>Reprove a wise man, and he will love thee.
<br>9Give to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser;
<br>Teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning.
<br>10The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom,
<br>And the knowledge of the All-holy is understanding.
<br>11For by me thy days shall be multiplied,
<br>And the years of thy life shall be increased.
<br>12If thou art wise, thou art wise for thyself;
<br>And if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it.’
<br>
<br>13The woman Folly is riotous;
<br> 
<br>She is thoughtless, and knoweth nothing.
<br>14And she sitteth at the door of her house,
<br>On a seat in the high places of the city,
<br>15To call to them that pass by, Who go right on their ways:
<br>16’Whoso is thoughtless, let him turn in hither’;
<br>And as for him that lacketh understanding, she saith to him:
<br>17’Stolen waters are sweet,
<br>And bread eaten in secret is pleasant.’
<br>18But he knoweth not that the shades are there;
<br>That her guests are in the depths of the nether-world.
<br>10 The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father;
<br>But a foolish son is the grief of his mother.
<br>
<br>2Treasures of wickedness profit nothing;
<br>But righteousness delivereth from death.
<br>
<br>3The LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish;
<br>But He thrusteth away the desire of the wicked.
<br>
<br>4He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand;
<br> 
<br>But the hand of the diligent maketh rich.
<br>
<br>5A wise son gathereth in summer;
<br>But a son that doeth shamefully sleepeth in harvest.
<br>
<br>6Blessings are upon the head of the righteous;
<br>But the mouth of the wicked concealeth violence.
<br>
<br>7The memory of the righteous shall be for a blessing;
<br>But the name of the wicked shall rot.
<br>
<br>8The wise in heart will receive commandments;
<br>But a prating fool shall fall.
<br>
<br>9He that walketh uprightly walketh securely;
<br>But he that perverteth his ways shall be found out.
<br>
<br>10He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow;
<br>And a prating fool shall fall.
<br>
<br>11The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life;
<br>But the mouth of the wicked concealeth violence.
<br>
<br>12Hatred stirreth up strifes;
<br>But love covereth all transgressions.
<br> 
<br>13In the lips of him that hath discernment wisdom is found;
<br>But a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding.
<br>
<br>14Wise men lay up knowledge;
<br>But the mouth of the foolish is an imminent ruin.
<br>15The rich man’s wealth is his strong city;
<br>The ruin of the poor is their poverty.
<br>
<br>16The wages of the righteous is life; The increase of the wicked is sin.
<br>
<br>17He is in the way of life that heedeth instruction;
<br>But he that forsaketh reproof erreth.
<br>
<br>18He that hideth hatred is of lying lips;
<br>And he that uttereth a slander is a fool.
<br>
<br>19In the multitude of words there wanteth not transgression;
<br>But he that refraineth his lips is wise.
<br>
<br>20The tongue of the righteous is as choice silver;
<br>The heart of the wicked is little worth.
<br>
<br>21The lips of the righteous feed many;
<br>But the foolish die for want of understanding.
<br> 
<br>22The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich,
<br>And toil addeth nothing thereto.
<br>
<br>23It is as sport to a fool to do wickedness,
<br>And so is wisdom to a man of discernment.
<br>
<br>24The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him;
<br>And the desire of the righteous shall be granted.
<br>
<br>25When the whirlwind passeth, the wicked is no more;
<br>But the righteous is an everlasting foundation.
<br>
<br>26As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes,
<br>So is the sluggard to them that send him.
<br>
<br>27The fear of the LORD prolongeth days;
<br>But the years of the wicked shall be shortened.
<br>
<br>28The hope of the righteous is gladness;
<br>But the expectation of the wicked shall perish.
<br>
<br>29The way of the LORD is a stronghold to the upright,
<br>But ruin to the workers of iniquity.
<br> 
<br>30The righteous shall never be moved;
<br>But the wicked shall not inhabit the land.
<br>
<br>31The mouth of the righteous buddeth with wisdom;
<br>But the froward tongue shall be cut off.
<br>
<br>32The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable;
<br>But the mouth of the wicked is all frowardness.
<br>
<br>A false balance is an abomination to the LORD;
<br>But a perfect weight is His delight.
