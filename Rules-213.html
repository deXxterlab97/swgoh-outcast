<br>
<br>(ii) over any other period established under the regulations.

<br>
<br>(c)(1) If a former employee or Member dies after having separated from the service with title to a deferred annuity under section 8413 but before having established a valid claim for an annuity, and is survived by a widow or widower to whom married on the date of separation, the widow or widower may elect to receive—

<br>(II) if the widow or widower so designates in the election, as of the day after the death of the former employee or Member.
<br>
<br>(ii) The present value of the annuity of a widow or widower who chooses the earlier commencement date under clause (i)(II) shall be actuarially equivalent to the present value of an annuity computed for the widow or widower, determined as if the commencement date under clause (i)(I) were applicable.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) Paragraphs (1) and (2) shall apply only in the case of an employee or Member who completes at least 10 years of service.
<br>

<br>
<br>(d)(1) The annuity of a widow or widower under this section commences on the day after the death of the individual on whose service such annuity is based. This annuity and the right thereto terminate on the last day of the month before the widow or widower—
<br>
<br>(A) dies; or
<br>
<br>(B) except as provided in paragraph (3), remarries before becoming 55 years of age.
<br>
<br>(2) In the case of a widow or widower whose annuity under this section is terminated because of remarriage before becoming 55 years of age, the annuity shall be restored at the same rate commencing on the day the remarriage is dissolved by death, divorce, or annulment, if—
<br>
<br>(A) the widow or widower elects to receive this annuity instead of any other survivor benefit to which such widow or widower may be entitled (under this subchapter or section 8424 or under another retirement system for Government employees) by reason of the remarriage; and
<br>
<br>(B) any lump sum paid on termination of the annuity is returned to the Fund.
<br>
<br>(3) Paragraph (1)(B) (relating to termination of a survivor annuity because of a remarriage before age 55) shall not apply if the widow or widower was married for at least 30 years to the individual on whose service the survivor annuity is based.
<br>

<br>(B) the amount determined under paragraph (3).
<br>
<br>(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the amount under this paragraph for a survivor is the amount of widow's or widower's insurance benefits which would be payable to such survivor under title II of the Social Security Act (without regard to sections 202(e)(7), 202(f)(2), and 203 of such Act) based on the wages and self-employment income of the deceased annuitant, and determined—
<br>
<br>(i) as of the date on which the annuitant died; and
<br>
<br>(ii) as if the survivor had attained age 60 and made application for those benefits under subsection (e) or (f) of section 202 of such Act, as the case may be.
<br>
<br>(B) Any computation or determination under this paragraph shall be made in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Social Security Act, except that in computing any primary insurance amount under section 215 of such Act for purposes of determining an amount under this subsection, subparagraphs (A) and (C) of section 8421(b)(2) shall apply.
<br>
<br>(4) A supplementary annuity under this subsection—
<br>
<br>(A) shall be payable to a survivor only for calendar months ending before the calendar month in which such survivor first satisfies the minimum age requirement under section 202(e)(1)(B)(i) or 202(f)(1)(B)(i) of the Social Security Act, as the case may be;
<br>
<br>(B) shall not be payable to a survivor who would not be entitled to benefits under subsection (e) or (f) of section 202 of the Social Security Act based on the wages and self-employment income of the deceased annuitant (determined, as of the date of the annuitant's death, as if the survivor had attained age 60 and made appropriate application for benefits, but without regard to any restriction under either such subsection relating to remarriage); and
<br>
<br>(C) shall not be payable to a survivor for any calendar month in which such survivor is entitled (or would, on proper application, be entitled) to benefits under section 202(g) of the Social Security Act (relating to mother's and father's insurance benefits), or under section 202(e) or (f) of such Act by reason of having become disabled, based on the wages and self-employment income of the deceased annuitant.
<br>
<br>(5) For the purpose of this subsection, the term "assumed CSRS annuity", as used in the case of a survivor, means the amount of the annuity to which such survivor would be entitled under subchapter III of chapter 83 of this title based on the service of the deceased annuitant, determined—
<br>
<br>(A) as of the day after the date of the annuitant's death;
<br>
<br>(B) as if the survivor had made appropriate application therefor; and
<br>
<br>(C) as if the service of the deceased annuitant were creditable under such subchapter.
<br>
<br>(6) An amount payable under this subsection shall be adjusted under section 8462 and shall otherwise be treated under this chapter in the same way as an amount payable under subsection (a).
<br>
<br>(g)(1) If the widow or widower of an annuitant under section 8452 (hereinafter in this subsection referred to as a "disability annuitant") is determined under subsection (a) to be entitled to an annuity based on the service of such disability annuitant, the annuity of the widow or widower shall be equal to 50 percent of the amount determined under paragraph (2) (or one-half thereof if designated for this purpose under section 8419 of this title), rather than of the amount referred to in subsection (a).
<br>
<br>(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the amount on which the annuity of the widow or widower of a disability annuitant is based shall be the amount of the annuity to which such disability annuitant was entitled, as computed under section 8452 (including appropriate reduction under subsection (a)(2) of such section and any adjustments under section 8462 allowed under section 8452), as of the day before the date of the disability annuitant's death.
<br>
<br>(B)(i) In the case of a widow or widower entitled to an annuity based on the service of a disability annuitant who dies before age 62, the amount under clause (ii) shall apply instead of the amount which would otherwise apply under subparagraph (A).
<br>
<br>(ii)(I) Subject to subclause (II), the amount of the annuity to which the disability annuitant was entitled as of the day before the date of death shall be considered to be the amount which would be computed with respect to such disability annuitant under section 8452(b) if the disability annuitant had attained age 62 on the day before date of death.
<br>
<br>(II) For purposes of any such computation under section 8452(b)(2) pursuant to this clause, creditable service shall (in addition to the service which would otherwise be used under subparagraph (B)(i) of such section) include the period of time between date of death and the date of the sixty-second anniversary of the birth of the annuitant, and average pay shall be adjusted in accordance with subparagraph (B)(ii) of such section only through date of death.
<br>
<br>(h) The following rules shall apply notwithstanding any other provision of this section:
<br>
<br>(1) The annuity payable under this section to a widow or widower may not exceed the difference between—
<br>
<br>(A) the amount of the annuity which would otherwise be payable to such widow or widower under this section; and
<br>
<br>(B) the amount of the annuity payable to any former spouse of the deceased employee, Member, or annuitant, or former employee or Member, based on an election made under section 8417(b) or a court order previously issued or agreement previously entered into as described in section 8445(a).
<br>
<br>(2) The amount payable under subsection (b)(1)(A) to a widow or widower may not exceed the difference between—
<br>
<br>(A) the amount which would otherwise be payable to such widow or widower under such subsection; and
<br>
<br>(B) the portion of such amount payable to any former spouse of the deceased employee, Member, or annuitant, or former employee or Member, based on a court order previously issued or agreement previously entered into.
<br>
<br>(3) A lump-sum credit under subsection (c)(2) shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as apply with respect to a lump-sum credit under section 8424(b).

<br>§8443. Rights of a child
<br>
<br>(a)(1) If an employee or Member dies after completing at least 18 months of civilian service which is creditable under section 8411, or an annuitant dies, each surviving child is, for any month, entitled to an annuity equal to—
<br>
<br>(A) the amount by which the applicable amount under paragraph (2) for such month exceeds the applicable amount under paragraph (3) for such month, divided by
<br>
<br>(B) the number of children entitled to a payment under this section for such month.
<br>
<br>(2) The applicable amount under this paragraph for any month is the total amount to which the surviving child or children (as the case may be) of the annuitant, employee, or Member would be entitled for such month under subchapter III of chapter 83 (including any adjustment based on section 8340) based on the service of such annuitant, employee, or Member, if the service of such annuitant, employee, or Member were creditable under such subchapter.
<br>
<br>(3) The applicable amount under this paragraph for any month is the total amount of child's insurance benefits which are payable (or would, on proper application, be payable) under title II of the Social Security Act for such month based on the wages and self-employment income of such annuitant, employee, or Member.
<br>
<br>(b) The annuity of a child under this subchapter—
<br>
<br>(1) commences on the day after the annuitant, employee, or Member dies;
<br>
<br>(2) commences or resumes on the first day of the month in which the child later becomes or again becomes a student as described by section 8441(4), if any lump sum paid is returned to the Fund; or
<br>
<br>(3) commences or resumes on the first day of the month in which the child later becomes or again becomes incapable of self-support because of a mental or physical disability incurred before age 18 (or a later recurrence of such disability), if any lump sum paid is returned to the Fund.
<br>
<br>This annuity and the right thereto terminate on the last day of the month before the child—
<br>
<br>(A) becomes 18 years of age unless then a student as described or incapable of self-support;
<br>
<br>(B) becomes capable of self-support after becoming 18 years of age unless then such a student;

<br>§8445. Rights of a former spouse
<br>
<br>(a) Subject to subsections (b) through (e), a former spouse of a deceased employee, Member, or annuitant (or of a former employee or Member who dies after having separated from the service with title to a deferred annuity under section 8413 but before having established a valid claim for annuity) is entitled to an annuity under this section, if and to the extent expressly provided for in an election under section 8417(b), or in the terms of any decree of divorce or annulment or any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement incident to such decree.
<br>
<br>(b)(1) The annuity payable to a former spouse under this section may not exceed the difference between—
<br>
<br>(A) the amount applicable in the case of such former spouse, as determined under paragraph (2); and

<br>(B) the amount of any annuity payable under this section to any other former spouse of the employee, Member, or annuitant, or former employee or Member, based on an election previously made under section 8417(b), or a court order previously issued or agreement previously entered into as described in subsection (a).
<br>
<br>(2) The applicable amount, for purposes of paragraph (1)(A) in the case of a former spouse, is the amount of the annuity which would be payable under the provisions of section 8442 (including subsection (f) of such section, but without regard to subsection (h) of such section) if such former spouse were a widow or widower entitled to an annuity under such provisions based on the service of the deceased employee, Member, or annuitant, or former employee or Member.

<br>
<br>(B) the first day of the second month beginning after the date on which the Office receives written notice of the order, decree, agreement, or election, as the case may be, together with such additional information or documentation as the Office may prescribe;
<br>
<br>whichever is later; and
<br>
<br>(2) except as provided in subsection (h), shall terminate no later than the last day of the month before the former spouse remarries before becoming 55 years of age or dies.

<br>
<br>(a)(1)(A) An employee who completes at least 18 months of civilian service creditable under section 8411 and has become disabled shall be retired on the employee's own application or on application by the employee's agency.
<br>
<br>(B) For purposes of this subsection, an employee shall be considered disabled only if the employee is found by the Office to be unable, because of disease or injury, to render useful and efficient service in the employee's position.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), an employee shall not be eligible for disability retirement under this section if the employee has declined a reasonable offer of reassignment to a vacant position in the employee's agency for which the employee is qualified if the position—
<br>
<br>(i) is at the same grade (or pay level) as the employee's most recent grade (or pay level) or higher;
<br>
<br>(ii) is within the employee's commuting area; and

<br>(iii) is one in which the employee would be able to render useful and efficient service.
<br>
<br>(B) An employee who is applying for disability retirement under this subchapter shall be considered for reassignment by the employee's agency to a vacant position described in subparagraph (A) in accordance with such procedures as the Office shall by regulation prescribe.

<br>
<br>(Added Pub. L. 99–335, title I, §101(a), June 6, 1986, 100 Stat. 565.)
<br>§8452. Computation of disability annuity
<br>
<br>(a)(1)(A) Except as provided in paragraph (2), or subsection (b), (c), or (d), the annuity of an annuitant under this subchapter—
<br>
<br>(i) for the period beginning on the date on which such annuity commences, or is restored (as described in section 8455(b)(2) or (3)), and ending at the end of the twelfth month beginning on or after such date, shall be equal to 60 percent of the annuitant's average pay; and
<br>
<br>(ii) after the end of the period referred to in clause (i), shall be equal to 40 percent of the annuitant's average pay.
<br>
<br>(B) An annuity computed under this paragraph—
<br>
<br>(i) shall not, during any period referred to in subparagraph (A)(i), be adjusted under section 8462; but
<br>
<br>(ii) shall, after the end of any period referred to in subparagraph (A)(i), be adjusted to reflect all adjustments made under section 8462(b) after the end of the period referred to in subparagraph (A)(i), whether the amount actually payable to the annuitant under this section in any month is determined under this subsection or otherwise.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) For any month in which an annuitant is entitled both to an annuity under this subchapter as computed under paragraph (1) and to a disability insurance benefit under section 223 of the Social Security Act, the annuitant's annuity for such month (as so computed) shall—
<br>
<br>(i) if such month occurs during a period referred to in paragraph (1)(A)(i), be reduced by 100 percent of the annuitant's assumed disability insurance benefit for such month; or
<br>
<br>(ii) if such month occurs other than during a period referred to in paragraph (1)(A)(i), be reduced by 60 percent of the annuitant's assumed disability insurance benefit for such month;
<br>
<br>except that an annuity may not be reduced below zero by reason of this paragraph.
<br>
<br>(B)(i) For purposes of this paragraph, the assumed disability insurance benefit of an annuitant for any month shall be equal to—
<br>
<br>(I) the amount of the disability insurance benefit to which the annuitant is entitled under section 223 of the Social Security Act for the month in which the annuity under this subchapter commences, or is restored, or, if no entitlement to such disability insurance benefits exists for such month, the first month thereafter for which the annuitant is entitled both to an annuity under this subchapter and disability insurance benefits under section 223 of the Social Security Act, adjusted by
<br>
<br>(II) all adjustments made under section 8462(b) after the end of the period referred to in paragraph (1)(A)(i) (or, if later, after the end of the month preceding the first month for which the annuitant is entitled both to an annuity under this subchapter and disability insurance benefits under section 223 of the Social Security Act) and before the start of the month involved (without regard to whether the annuitant's annuity was affected by any of those adjustments).
<br>
<br>(ii) For purposes of applying section 224 of the Social Security Act to the assumed disability insurance benefit used to compute the reduction under this paragraph, the amount of the annuity under this subchapter which is considered shall be the amount of the annuity as determined before the application of this paragraph.
<br>
<br>(3) Section 8462 shall apply with respect to amounts under this subsection only as provided in paragraphs (1) and (2).
<br>
<br>(b)(1) Except as provided in subsection (d), if an annuitant is entitled to an annuity under this subchapter as of the day before the date of the sixty-second anniversary of the annuitant's birth (hereinafter in this section referred to as the annuitant's "redetermination date"), such annuity shall be redetermined by the Office in accordance with paragraph (2). Effective as of the annuitant's redetermination date, the annuity (as so redetermined) shall be in lieu of any annuity to which such annuitant would otherwise be entitled under this subchapter.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) An annuity redetermined under this subsection shall be equal to the amount of the annuity to which the annuitant would be entitled under section 8415, taking into account the provisions of subparagraph (B).
<br>
<br>(B) In performing a computation under this paragraph—
<br>
<br>(i) creditable service of an annuitant shall be increased by including any period (or periods) before the annuitant's redetermination date during which the annuitant was entitled to an annuity under this subchapter; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the average pay which would otherwise be used shall be adjusted to reflect all adjustments made under section 8462(b) with respect to any period (or periods) referred to in clause (i) (without regard to whether the annuitant's annuity was affected by any of those adjustments).
<br>
<br>(c) Except as provided in subsection (d), the annuity of an annuitant under this subchapter shall be computed under section 8415 if—
<br>
<br>(1) such annuity commences, or is restored, beginning on or after the redetermination date of the annuitant; or
<br>
<br>(2) as of the day on which such annuity commences, or is restored, the annuitant satisfies the age and service requirements for entitlement to an annuity under section 8412 (other than subsection (g) of such section).
<br>
<br>(d)(1) The annuity to which an annuitant is entitled under this section (after the reduction under subsection (a)(2), if applicable, has been made) shall not be less than the amount of an annuity computed under section 8415 (excluding subsection (h) of such section).
<br>
<br>(2) In applying this subsection with respect to any annuitant, the amount of an annuity so computed under section 8415 shall be adjusted under section 8462 (including subsection (c) thereof)—
<br>
<br>(A) to the same extent, and otherwise in the same manner, as if it were an annuity—
<br>
<br>(i) subject to adjustment under such section; and
<br>
<br>(ii) with a commencement date coinciding with the date the annuitant's annuity commenced or was restored under this subchapter, as the case may be; and
<br>
<br>(B) whether the amount actually payable to the annuitant under this section in any month is determined under this subsection or otherwise.
