<br>
<br>"This subtitle may be cited as the 'Justice Department Organized Crime and Drug Enforcement Enhancement Act of 1988'.
<br>"SEC. 1052. FINDINGS.
<br>
<br>"The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>"(1) organized criminal activity contributes significantly to the importation, distribution, and sale of illegal and dangerous drugs;
<br>
<br>"(2) trends in drug trafficking patterns necessitate a response that gives appropriate weight to—
<br>
<br>"(A) the prosecution of drug-related crimes; and
<br>
<br>"(B) the forfeiture and seizure of assets and other civil remedies used to strike at the inherent strength of the drug networks and organized crime groups;
<br>
<br>"(3) law enforcement components of the Department of Justice should give high priority to the enforcement of civil sanctions against drug networks and organized crime groups; and
<br>
<br>"(4) the structure of the Department of Justice Criminal Division needs to be reviewed in order to determine the most effective structure to address such drug-related problems.
<br>"SEC. 1053. CIVIL ENFORCEMENT REPORT.
<br>
<br>"(a) Report.—Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this title [Nov. 18, 1988], the Director of National Drug Control Policy (the Director) in consultation with the Attorney General, shall report to the Congress on the necessity to establish a new division or make other organizational changes within the Department of Justice in order to promote better civil and criminal law enforcement. In preparing such report, the Director shall consider restructuring and consolidating one or more of the following divisions and programs—
<br>
<br>"(1) the Organized Crime and Racketeering Section of the Criminal Division and all subordinate strike forces therein;
<br>
<br>"(2) the Narcotic and Dangerous Drug Section of the Criminal Division;
<br>
<br>"(3) the Asset Forfeiture Office of the Criminal Division; and

<br>"SEC. 1054. CIVIL ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT.
<br>
<br>"(a) Duty of Attorney General.—The Attorney General shall insure that each component of the Department of Justice having criminal law enforcement responsibilities with respect to the prosecution of organized crime and controlled substances violations, including each United States Attorney's Office, attaches a high priority to the enforcement of civil statutes creating ancillary sanctions and remedies for such violations, such as civil penalties and actions, forfeitures, injunctions and restraining orders, and collection of fines.
<br>
<br>"(b) Duty of Associate Attorney General.—The Associate Attorney General shall be responsible for implementing the policy set forth in this subsection.
<br>
<br>"(c) Authorization of Appropriations.—(1) There are authorized to be appropriated $3,000,000 for salaries and expenses to the Department of Justice General Legal Activities Account and $3,000,000 for salaries and expenses for United States Attorneys for fiscal year 1989.
<br>
<br>"(2) Any appropriation of funds authorized under paragraph (1) shall be—
<br>
<br>"(A) in addition to any appropriations requested by the President in the 1989 fiscal year budget submitted by the President to the Congress on February 18, 1988, or provided in regular appropriations Acts or continuing resolutions for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1989; and
<br>
<br>"(B) used to increase the number of field attorneys and related support staff over such personnel levels employed at the Department of Justice on September 30, 1988.
<br>
<br>"(3) Any increase in full-time equivalent positions described under paragraph (2)(B) shall be exclusively used for asset forfeiture and civil enforcement and be assigned to appropriate field offices of the Organized Crime and Racketeering Section and the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces.
<br>
<br>"(d) Reporting Requirement.—The Attorney General, at the end of each such fiscal year, shall file a report with the Congress setting forth the extent of such enforcement efforts, as well as the need for any enhancements in resources necessary to carry out this policy.
<br>"SEC. 1055. EXPENSES OF TASK FORCES.
<br>
<br>"(a) Appropriations and Reimbursements Procedure.—Beginning in fiscal year 1990, the Attorney General in his budget shall submit a separate appropriations request for expenses relating to all Federal agencies participating in the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces. Such appropriations shall be made to the Department of Justice's Interagency Law Enforcement Appropriation Account for the Attorney General to make reimbursements to the involved agencies as necessary.
<br>
<br>"(b) Enhancement of Field Activities.—The appropriations and reimbursements procedure described under subsection (a) shall—
<br>
<br>"(1) provide for the flexibility of the Task Forces which is vital to success;
<br>
<br>"(2) permit Federal law enforcement resources to be shifted in response to changing patterns of organized criminal drug activities;
<br>
<br>"(3) permit the Attorney General to reallocate resources among the organizational components of the Task Forces and between regions without undue delay; and
<br>
<br>"(4) ensure that the Task Forces function as a unit, without the competition for resources among the participating agencies that would undermine the overall effort."

<br>
<br>(c) Such further measures and dispositions as the Director of the Bureau of the Budget shall deem to be necessary in order to effectuate the transfers provided in this section shall be carried out in such manner as he may direct and by such agencies as he shall designate.
<br>Message of the President
<br>
<br>To the Congress of the United States:
<br>
<br>In my first Reorganization Plan of 1968, I call for the creation of a new and powerful Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs.
<br>
<br>With this action, America will serve notice to the pusher and the peddler that their criminal acts must stop.
<br>
<br>No matter how well organized they are, we will be better organized. No matter how well they have concealed their activities, we will root them out.
<br>
<br>Today, Federal investigation and enforcement of our narcotics laws are fragmented. One major element—the Bureau of Narcotics—is in the Treasury Department and responsible for the control of marihuana and narcotics such as heroin. Another—the Bureau of Drug Abuse Control—is in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and is responsible for the control of dangerous drugs including depressants, stimulants, and hallucinogens such as LSD.
<br>
<br>Neither is located in the agency which is primarily concerned with Federal law enforcement—the Department of Justice.
<br>
<br>This separation of responsibilities—despite the relentless and dedicated efforts of the agents of each Bureau—has complicated and hindered our response to a national menace.
<br>
<br>For example, more than nine out of ten seizures of LSD made by the Bureau of Drug Abuse Control have also turned up marihuana—but that Bureau has no jurisdiction over marihuana.
<br>
<br>In many instances, we are confronted by well organized disciplined and resourceful criminals who reap huge profits at the expense of their unfortunate victims.
<br>
<br>The response of the Federal Government must be unified. And it must be total.
<br>
<br>Today, in my Message on Crime, I recommended strong new laws to control dangerous drugs. I also recommended an increase of more than thirty percent in the number of Federal agents enforcing the narcotic and dangerous drug laws.
<br>
<br>I now propose that a single Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs be established in the Department of Justice to administer those laws and to bring to the American people the most efficient and effective Federal enforcement machinery we can devise.
<br>
<br>Under this Reorganization Plan the Attorney General will have full authority and responsibility for enforcing the Federal laws relating to narcotics and dangerous drugs. The new Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, to be headed by a Director appointed by the Attorney General, will:
<br>
<br>—consolidate the authority and preserve the experience and manpower of the Bureau of Narcotics and the Bureau of Drug Abuse Control.
<br>
<br>—work with states and local governments in their crackdown on illegal trade in drugs and narcotics, and help to train local agents and investigators.
<br>
<br>—maintain worldwide operations, working closely with other nations, to suppress the trade in illicit narcotics and marihuana.
<br>
<br>—conduct an extensive campaign of research and a nationwide public education program on drug abuse and its tragic effects.
<br>
<br>The Plan I forward today moves in the direction recommended by two distinguished groups:
<br>
<br>—1949 Hoover Commission.
<br>
<br>—the 1963 Presidential Advisory Commission on Narcotic and Drug Abuse.
<br>
<br>This Administration and this Congress have the will and the determination to stop the illicit traffic in drugs.
<br>
<br>But we need more than the will and the determination. We need a modern and efficient instrument of Government to transform our plans into action. That is what this Reorganization Plan calls for.
<br>
<br>The Plan has been prepared in accordance with chapter 9 of title 5 of the United States Code.
<br>
<br>I have found, after investigation, that each reorganization included in the plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 901(a) of title 5 of the United States Code.
<br>
<br>I have also found that, by reason of these reorganizations, it is necessary to include in the accompanying plan provisions for the appointment and compensation of the five new positions as specified in section 3 of the plan. The rates of compensation fixed for these new positions are those which I have found to prevail in respect of comparable positions in the Executive Branch of the Government.
<br>
<br>Should the reorganization I propose take effect, they will make possible more effective and efficient administration of Federal law enforcement functions. It is not practicable at this time, however, to itemize the reduction in expenditures which may result.
<br>
<br>I recommend that the Congress allow this urgently needed and important Reorganization Plan to become effective.

<br>Message of the President
<br>
<br>To the Congress of the United States:
<br>
<br>Drug abuse is one of the most vicious and corrosive forces attacking the foundations of American society today. It is a major cause of crime and a merciless destroyer of human lives. We must fight it with all of the resources at our command.
<br>
<br>This Administration has declared all-out, global war on the drug menace. As I reported to the Congress earlier this month in my State of the Union message, there is evidence of significant progress on a number of fronts in that war.
<br>
<br>Both the rate of new addiction to heroin and the number of narcotic-related deaths showed an encouraging downturn last year. More drug addicts and abusers are in treatment and rehabilitation programs than ever before.
<br>
<br>Progress in pinching off the supply of illicit drugs was evident in last year's stepped-up volume of drug seizures worldwide—which more than doubled in 1972 over the 1971 level.
<br>
<br>Arrests of traffickers have risen by more than one-third since 1971. Prompt Congressional action on my proposal for mandatory minimum sentences for pushers of hard drugs will help ensure that convictions stemming from such arrests lead to actual imprisonment of the guilty.
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding these gains, much more must be done. The resilience of the international drug trade remains grimly impressive—current estimates suggest that we still intercept only a small fraction of all the heroin and cocaine entering this country. Local police still find that more than one of every three suspects arrested for street crimes is a narcotic abuser or addict. And the total number of Americans addicted to narcotics, suffering terribly themselves and inflicting their suffering in countless others, still stands in the hundreds of thousands.
<br>A UNIFIED COMMAND FOR DRUG ENFORCEMENT
<br>
<br>Seeking ways to intensify our counter-offensive against this menace, I am asking the Congress today to join with this Administration in strengthening and streamlining the Federal drug law enforcement effort.
<br>
<br>Funding for this effort has increased sevenfold during the past five years, from $36 million in fiscal year 1969 to $257 million in fiscal year 1974—more money is not the most pressing enforcement need at present. Nor is there a primary need for more manpower working on the problem, over 2100 new agents having already been added to the Federal drug enforcement agencies under this Administration, an increase of more than 250 percent over the 1969 level.
<br>
<br>The enforcement work could benefit significantly, however, from consolidation of our anti-drug forces under a single unified command. Right now the Federal Government is fighting the war on drug abuse under a distinct handicap, for its efforts are those of a loosely confederated alliance facing a resourceful, elusive, worldwide enemy. Admiral Mahan, the master naval strategist, described this handicap precisely when he wrote that "Granting the same aggregate of force, it is never as great in two hands as in one, because it is not perfectly concentrated."
<br>
<br>More specifically, the drug law enforcement activities of the United States now are not merely in two hands but in half a dozen. Within the Department of Justice, with no overall direction below the level of the Attorney General, these fragmented forces include the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, the Office for Drug Abuse Law Enforcement, the Office of National Narcotics Intelligence, and certain activities of the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration. The Treasury Department is also heavily engaged in enforcement work through the Bureau of Customs.
<br>
<br>This aggregation of Federal activities has grown up rapidly over the past few years in response to the urgent need for stronger anti-drug measures. It has enabled us to make a very encouraging beginning in the accelerated drug enforcement drive of this Administration.
<br>
<br>But it also has serious operational and organizational shortcomings. Certainly the cold-blooded underworld networks that funnel narcotics from suppliers all over the world into the veins of American drug victims are no respecters of the bureaucratic dividing lines that now complicate our anti-drug efforts. On the contrary, these modern-day slave traders can derive only advantage from the limitations of the existing organizational patchwork. Experience has now given us a good basis for correcting those limitations, and it is time to do so.
<br>
<br>I therefore propose creation of a single, comprehensive Federal agency within the Department of Justice to lead the war against illicit drug traffic.
<br>
<br>Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1973, which I am transmitting to the Congress with this message, would establish such an agency, to be called the Drug Enforcement Administration. It would be headed by an Administrator reporting directly to the Attorney General.
<br>
<br>The Drug Enforcement Administration would carry out the following anti-drug functions, and would absorb the associated manpower and budgets:
<br>
<br>—All functions of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (which would be abolished as a separate entity by the reorganization plan);
<br>
<br>—Those functions of the Bureau of Customs pertaining to drug investigations and intelligence (to be transferred from the Treasury Department to the Attorney General by the reorganization plan).
<br>
<br>—All functions of the Office of Drug Abuse Law Enforcement; and
<br>
<br>—All functions of the Office of National Narcotics Intelligence.
<br>
<br>Merger of the latter two organizations into the new agency would be effected by an executive order dissolving them and transferring their functions, to take effect upon approval of Reorganization Plan No. 2 by the Congress. Drug law enforcement research currently funded by the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration and other agencies would also be transferred to the new agency by executive action.
<br>
<br>The major responsibility of the Drug Enforcement Administration would thus include:
<br>
<br>—development of overall Federal drug law enforcement strategy, programs, planning, and evaluation;
<br>
<br>—full investigation and preparation for prosecution of suspects for violations under all Federal drug trafficking laws;
<br>
<br>—full investigation and preparation for prosecution of suspects connected with illicit drugs seized at U.S. ports-of-entry and international borders;
<br>
<br>—conduct of all relations with drug law enforcement officials of foreign governments, under the policy guidance of the Cabinet Committee on International Narcotics Control;
<br>
<br>—full coordination and cooperation with State and local law enforcement officials on joint drug enforcement efforts; and
<br>
<br>—regulation of the legal manufacture of drugs and other controlled substances under Federal regulations.
<br>
<br>The Attorney General, working closely with the Administrator of this new agency, would have authority to make needed program adjustments. He would take steps within the Department of Justice to ensure that high priority emphasis is placed on the prosecution and sentencing of drug traffickers following their apprehension by the enforcement organization. He would also have the authority and responsibility for securing the fullest possible cooperation-particularly with respect to collection of drug intelligence—from all Federal departments and agencies which can contribute to the anti-drug work, including the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
<br>
<br>My proposals would make possible a more effective antidrug role for the FBI, especially in dealing with the relationship between drug trafficking and organized crime. I intend to see that the resources of the FBI are fully committed to assist in supporting the new Drug Enforcement Administration.
<br>
<br>The consolidation effected under Reorganization Plan No. 2 would reinforce the basic law enforcement and criminal justice mission of the Department of Justice. With worldwide drug law enforcement responsibilities no longer divided among several organizations in two different Cabinet departments, more complete and cumulative drug law enforcement intelligence could be compiled. Patterns of international and domestic illicit drug production, distribution, and sale could be more directly compared and interpreted. Case-by-case drug law enforcement activities could be more comprehensively linked, cross-referenced, and coordinated into a single, organic enforcement operation. In short, drug law enforcement officers would be able to spend more time going after the traffickers and less time coordinating with one another.
<br>
<br>Such progress could be especially helpful on the international front. Narcotics control action plans, developed under the leadership of the Cabinet Committee on International Narcotics Control, are now being carried out by U.S. officials in cooperation with host governments in 59 countries around the world. This wide-ranging effort to cut off drug supplies before they ever reach U.S. borders or streets is just now beginning to bear fruit. We can enhance its effectiveness, with little disruption of ongoing enforcement activities, by merging both the highly effective narcotics force of overseas Customs agents and the rapidly developing international activities of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs into the Drug Enforcement Administration. The new agency would work closely with the Cabinet Committee under the active leadership of the U.S. Ambassador in each country where anti-drug programs are underway.
<br>
<br>Two years ago, when I established the Special Action Office for Drug Abuse Prevention within the Executive Office of the President, we gained an organization with the necessary resources, breadth, and leadership capacity to begin dealing decisively with the "demand" side of the drug abuse problem—treatment and rehabilitation for those who have been drug victims, and preventive programs for potential drug abusers. This year, by permitting my reorganization proposals to take effect, the Congress can help provide a similar capability on the "supply" side. The proposed Drug Enforcement Administration, working as a team with the Special Action Office, would arm Americans with a potent one-two punch to help us fight back against the deadly menace of drug abuse. I ask full Congressional cooperation in its establishment.
<br>IMPROVING PORT-OF-ENTRY INSPECTIONS
<br>
<br>No heroin or cocaine is produced within the United States; domestic availability of these substances results solely from their illegal importation. The careful and complete inspection of all persons and goods coming into the United States is therefore an integral part of effective Federal drug law enforcement.
<br>
<br>At the present time, however, Federal responsibility for conducting port-of-entry inspections is awkwardly divided among several Cabinet departments. The principal agencies involved are the Treasury Department's Bureau of Customs, which inspects goods, and the Justice Department's Immigration and Naturalization Service, which inspects persons and their papers. The two utilize separate inspection procedures, hold differing views of inspection priorities, and employ dissimilar personnel management practices.
<br>
<br>To reduce the possibility that illicit drugs will escape detection at ports-of-entry because of divided responsibility, and to enhance the effectiveness of the Drug Enforcement Administration, the reorganization plan which I am proposing today would transfer to the Secretary of the Treasury all functions currently vested in Justice Department officials to inspect persons, or the documents of persons.
<br>
<br>When the plan takes effect, it is my intention to direct the Secretary of the Treasury to use the resources so transferred—including some 1,000 employees of the Immigration and Naturalization Service—to augment the staff and budget of the Bureau of Customs. The Bureau's primary responsibilities would then include:
<br>
<br>—inspection of all persons and goods entering the United States;
<br>
<br>—valuation of goods being imported, and assessment of appropriate tariff duties;
<br>
<br>—interception of contraband being smuggled into the United States;
<br>
<br>—enforcement of U.S. laws governing the international movement of goods, except the investigation of contraband drugs and narcotics; and
<br>
<br>—turning over the investigation responsibility for all drug law enforcement cases to the Department of Justice.
<br>
<br>The reorganization would thus group most port-of-entry inspection functions in a single Cabinet department. It would reduce the need for much day-to-day interdepartmental coordination, allow more efficient staffing at some field locations, and remove the basis for damaging interagency rivalries. It would also give the Secretary of the Treasury the authority and flexibility to meet changing requirements in inspecting the international flow of people and goods. An important by-product of the change would be more convenient service for travellers entering and leaving the country.
<br>
<br>For these reasons, I am convinced that inspection activities at U.S. ports-of-entry can more effectively support our drug law enforcement efforts if concentrated in a single agency. The processing of persons at ports-of-entry is too closely interrelated with the inspection of goods to remain organizationally separated from it any longer. Both types of inspections have numerous objectives besides drug law enforcement, so it is logical to vest them in the Treasury Department, which has long had the principal responsibility for port-of-entry inspection of goods, including goods being transported in connection with persons. As long as the inspections are conducted with full awareness of related drug concerns it is neither necessary nor desirable that they be made a responsibility of the primary drug enforcement organization.
<br>DECLARATIONS
<br>
<br>After investigation, I have found that each action included in Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1973 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in Section 901(a) of Title 5 of the United States Code. In particular, the plan is responsive of the intention of the Congress as expressed in Section 901(a)(1): "to promote better execution of the laws, more effective management of the executive branch and of its agencies and functions, and expeditious administration of the public business;" Section 901(a)(3): "to increase the efficiency of the operations of the Government to the fullest extent practicable;" Section 901(a)(5) "to reduce the number of agencies by consolidating those having similar functions under a single head, and to abolish such agencies or functions as may not be necessary for the efficient conduct of the Government;" and Section 901(a)(6): "to eliminate overlapping and duplication of effort."
<br>
<br>As required by law, the plan has one logically consistent subject matter: consolidation of Federal drug law enforcement activities in a manner designed to increase their effectiveness.
<br>
<br>The plan would establish in the Department of Justice a new Administration designated as the Drug Enforcement Administration. The reorganizations provided for in the plan make necessary the appointment and compensation of new officers as specified in Section 5 of the plan. The rates of compensation fixed for these officers would be comparable to those fixed for officers in the executive branch who have similar responsibilities.
<br>
<br>While it is not practicable to specify all of the expenditure reductions and other economies which may result from the actions proposed, some savings may be anticipated in administrative costs now associated with the functions being transferred and consolidated.
<br>
<br>The proposed reorganization is a necessary step in upgrading the effectiveness of our Nation's drug law enforcement effort. Both of the proposed changes would build on the strengths of established agencies, yielding maximum gains in the battle against drug abuse with minimum loss of time and momentum in the transition.
<br>
<br>I am confident that this reorganization plan would significantly increase the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the Federal Government. I urge the Congress to allow it to become effective.
