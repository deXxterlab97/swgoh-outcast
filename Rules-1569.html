<br>
<br>In subsection (a), the words before clause (1) are added because of the restatement. In clause (5), the words "that is 0.835 inch in diameter" are added because the Secretary of the Treasury has prescribed the diameter and the diameter of a coin may not be changed under 31:276. The words "5 grams" are substituted for "seventy-seven and sixteen-hundredths grains troy" for consistency in the revised chapter. In clause (6), the words "that is 0.75 inch in diameter" are added because the Secretary has prescribed the diameter and the diameter of a coin may not be changed under 31:276.

The words "Any coins minted after July 23, 1965, from 900 fine coin silver shall be inscribed with the year 1964" in 31:324 are omitted because the Secretary no longer has authority to mint coins from 900 fine coin silver.
<br>
<br>In subsection (d)(2), the word "Secretary" is substituted for "engraver", "Director of the Mint", and "Director of the Mint . . . with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury" because of the source provisions restated in section 321(c) of the revised title. The word "dies" is substituted for "from the original dies already authorized all the working dies required for use in the coinage of the several mints" and "original dies" to eliminate unnecessary words. The word "inscription" is substituted for "legend" for consistency in the section. The words "Provided, That no change be made in the diameter of any coin" are omitted as unnecessary because the diameters are prescribed by subsection (a) of the revised section. The words "procure services under section 3109 of title 5 in carrying out this paragraph" are substituted for "engage temporarily for this purpose the services of one or more artists, distinguished in their respective departments of art" to eliminate unnecessary words.

The words "that are metallurgically bonded to" are added for clarity and consistency with subsection (b). In clause (4), the words "the late President of the United States" in 31:324b are omitted as unnecessary. Clause (6) is added because 31:324 applies to coins minted under this subsection.
<br>
<br>In subsection (f)(1), before clause (A), the words "Notwithstanding this section and section 5111(a)(1) of this title are substituted for "Notwithstanding any other provision of law" in 31:399 for clarity.

<br>1921 Silver Dollar Coins
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 116–286, Jan. 5, 2021, 134 Stat. 4879, provided that:
<br>"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
<br>
<br>"This Act may be cited as the '1921 Silver Dollar Coin Anniversary Act'.
<br>"SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
<br>
<br>"The Congress finds that [sic] following:
<br>
<br>"(1) In December 1921, the Peace silver dollar was approved by Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon, replacing the Morgan silver dollar and commemorating the declaration of peace between the United States and the Imperial German government.
<br>
<br>"(2) The Peace silver dollar was minted in Philadelphia, Denver and San Francisco. The Morgan silver dollar was minted at Philadelphia, Denver, San Francisco, Carson City, and New Orleans.
<br>
<br>"(3) The Peace silver dollar was designed by Anthony de Francisci with the Goddess of Liberty on the obverse and a bald eagle clutching the olive branch (a symbol of peace) on the reverse. The Peace silver dollars were minted between 1921 to 1935.
<br>
<br>"(4) The Morgan silver dollar was designed by George T. Morgan and was minted from 1878 to 1904, and again in 1921. The obverse depicts a profile portrait of Lady Liberty and on the reverse, a heraldic eagle.
<br>
<br>"(5) The conversion from the Morgan silver dollar to the Peace silver dollar design in 1921 reflected a pivotal moment in American history. The Morgan silver dollar represents the country's westward expansion and industrial development in the late 19th century. The Peace silver dollar symbolizes the country's coming of age as an international power while recognizing the sacrifices made by her citizens in World War I and celebrating the victory and peace that ensued.
<br>
<br>"(6) These iconic silver dollars with vastly different representations of Lady Liberty and the American Eagle, reflect a changing of the guard in 1921 in the United States and therefore on the 100th anniversary must begin to be minted again to commemorate this significant evolution of American freedom.
<br>"SEC. 3. COIN SPECIFICATIONS.
<br>
<br>"(a) $1 Silver Coins.—The Secretary of the Treasury (hereafter in this Act referred to as the 'Secretary') shall mint and issue $1 coins in recognition of the 100th anniversary of completion of coinage of the Morgan dollar and the 100th anniversary of commencement of coinage of the Peace dollar, each of which shall—
<br>
<br>"(1) weigh 26.73 grams;
<br>
<br>"(2) have a diameter of 1.500 inches;
<br>
<br>"(3) contain not less than 90 percent silver; and
<br>
<br>"(4) have a reeded edge.
