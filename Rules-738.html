<br>(C) Nationwide specialty consumer reporting agency
<br>(i) In general

<br>(ii) Considerations
<br>
<br>In prescribing regulations under clause (i), the Bureau shall consider—
<br>
<br>(I) the significant demands that may be placed on consumer reporting agencies in providing such consumer reports;

<br>(b) Free disclosure after adverse notice to consumer
<br>
<br>Each consumer reporting agency that maintains a file on a consumer shall make all disclosures pursuant to section 1681g of this title without charge to the consumer if, not later than 60 days after receipt by such consumer of a notification pursuant to section 1681m of this title, or of a notification from a debt collection agency affiliated with that consumer reporting agency stating that the consumer's credit rating may be or has been adversely affected, the consumer makes a request under section 1681g of this title.
<br>(c) Free disclosure under certain other circumstances
<br>
<br>Upon the request of the consumer, a consumer reporting agency shall make all disclosures pursuant to section 1681g of this title once during any 12-month period without charge to that consumer if the consumer certifies in writing that the consumer—

<br>(1) is unemployed and intends to apply for employment in the 60-day period beginning on the date on which the certification is made;
<br>
<br>(2) is a recipient of public welfare assistance; or

<br>Upon the request of a consumer, a consumer reporting agency described in section 1681a(p) of this title shall make all disclosures pursuant to section 1681g of this title without charge to the consumer, as provided in subsections (a)(2) and (b)(2) of section 1681c–1 of this title, as applicable.

<br>
<br>(i) shall not exceed $8; and
<br>
<br>(ii) shall be indicated to the consumer before making the disclosure; and
<br>
<br>(B) for furnishing, pursuant to section 1681i(d) of this title, following a reinvestigation under section 1681i(a) of this title, a statement, codification, or summary to a person designated by the consumer under that section after the 30-day period beginning on the date of notification of the consumer under paragraph (6) or (8) of section 1681i(a) of this title with respect to the reinvestigation, which charge—
<br>
<br>(i) shall not exceed the charge that the agency would impose on each designated recipient for a consumer report; and

<br>(ii) shall be indicated to the consumer before furnishing such information.
<br>(2) Modification of amount
<br>
<br>The Bureau shall increase the amount referred to in paragraph (1)(A)(i) on January 1 of each year, based proportionally on changes in the Consumer Price Index, with fractional changes rounded to the nearest fifty cents.

<br>(a) In general

<br>
<br>(2) provide to the consumer written or electronic disclosure—
<br>
<br>(A) of a numerical credit score as defined in section 1681g(f)(2)(A) of this title used by such person in taking any adverse action based in whole or in part on any information in a consumer report; and

<br>
<br>Whenever credit for personal, family, or household purposes involving a consumer is denied or the charge for such credit is increased either wholly or partly because of information obtained from a person other than a consumer reporting agency bearing upon the consumer's credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living, the user of such information shall, within a reasonable period of time, upon the consumer's written request for the reasons for such adverse action received within sixty days after learning of such adverse action, disclose the nature of the information to the consumer.

<br>(3) Consistency with verification requirements

<br>(h) Duties of users in certain credit transactions
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Subject to rules prescribed as provided in paragraph (6), if any person uses a consumer report in connection with an application for, or a grant, extension, or other provision of, credit on material terms that are materially less favorable than the most favorable terms available to a substantial proportion of consumers from or through that person, based in whole or in part on a consumer report, the person shall provide an oral, written, or electronic notice to the consumer in the form and manner required by regulations prescribed in accordance with this subsection.

<br>
<br>(B) the person has provided or will provide a notice to the consumer under subsection (a) in connection with the transaction.

<br>Statement of Findings and Purpose for 2008 Amendment
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 110–241, §2, June 3, 2008, 122 Stat. 1565, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(a) Findings.—The Congress finds as follows:
<br>
<br>"(1) The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act [of 2003] (commonly referred to as 'FACTA') [Pub. L. 108–159, see Short Title of 2003 Amendment note set out under section 1601 of this title] was enacted into law in 2003 and 1 of the purposes of such Act is to prevent criminals from obtaining access to consumers' private financial and credit information in order to reduce identity theft and credit card fraud.
<br>
<br>"(2) As part of that law, the Congress enacted a requirement, through an amendment to the Fair Credit Reporting Act [15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.], that no person that accepts credit cards or debit cards for the transaction of business shall print more than the last 5 digits of the card number or the expiration date upon any receipt provided to the card holder at the point of the sale or transaction.
<br>
<br>"(3) Many merchants understood that this requirement would be satisfied by truncating the account number down to the last 5 digits based in part on the language of the provision as well as the publicity in the aftermath of the passage of the law.
<br>
<br>"(4) Almost immediately after the deadline for compliance passed, hundreds of lawsuits were filed alleging that the failure to remove the expiration date was a willful violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act even where the account number was properly truncated.
<br>
<br>"(5) None of these lawsuits contained an allegation of harm to any consumer's identity.
<br>
<br>"(6) Experts in the field agree that proper truncation of the card number, by itself as required by the amendment made by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act [of 2003], regardless of the inclusion of the expiration date, prevents a potential fraudster from perpetrating identity theft or credit card fraud.
<br>
<br>"(7) Despite repeatedly being denied class certification, the continued appealing and filing of these lawsuits represents a significant burden on the hundreds of companies that have been sued and could well raise prices to consumers without corresponding consumer protection benefit.
<br>
<br>"(b) Purpose.—The purpose of this Act [amending this section and enacting provisions set out as notes under this section and section 1601 of this title] is to ensure that consumers suffering from any actual harm to their credit or identity are protected while simultaneously limiting abusive lawsuits that do not protect consumers but only result in increased cost to business and potentially increased prices to consumers."

<br>(C) Limitation
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding paragraph (2), a court may not impose any civil penalty on a person for a violation of section 1681s–2(a)(1) of this title, unless the person has been enjoined from committing the violation, or ordered not to commit the violation, in an action or proceeding brought by or on behalf of the Federal Trade Commission, and has violated the injunction or order, and the court may not impose any civil penalty for any violation occurring before the date of the violation of the injunction or order.
