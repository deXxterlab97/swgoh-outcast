<br>
<br> 
<br>5	Afflicted in few things, in many they shall be well rewarded: because God hath tried them, and found them worthy of himself.
<br>6	As gold in the furnace, he hath proved them, and as a victim of a holocaust, he hath received them, and in time there shall be respect had to them.
<br>7	The just shall shine, and shall run to and fro like sparks among the reeds.
<br>8	They shall judge nations, and rule over peo- ple, and their Lord shall reign for ever.
<br>9	They that trust in him shall understand the truth: and they that are faithful in love, shall rest in him: for grace and peace are to his elect. 10 But the wicked shall be punished according to their own devices: who have neglected the
<br>just, and have revolted from the Lord.
<br>11	For he that rejecteth wisdom, and disci- pline, is unhappy: and their hope is vain, and their labours without fruit, and their works un- profitable.
<br>12	Their wives are foolish, and their children wicked.
<br>13	Their offspring is cursed, for happy is the barren: and the undefiled, that hath not known bed in sin, she shall have fruit in the visitation of holy souls.
<br>14	And the eunuch, that hath not wrought in- iquity with his hands, nor thought wicked things against God for the precious gift of faith shall be given to him, and a most acceptable lot in the temple of God.
<br>15	For the fruit of good labours is glorious, and the root of wisdom never faileth.
<br>16	But the children of adulterers shall not come to perfection, and the seed of the unlawful bed shall be rooted out.
<br>17	And if they live long, they shall be nothing regarded, and their last old age shall be without honour.
<br> 
<br>18	And if they die quickly, they shall have no hope, nor speech of comfort in the day of trial.
<br>19	For dreadful are the ends of a wicked race.
<br>
<br>Chapter 4
<br>How beautiful is the chaste generation with glory: for the memory thereof is immortal: be- cause it is known both with God and with men. 2 When it is present, they imitate it: and they desire it, when it hath withdrawn itself, and it triumpheth crowned for ever, winning the reward
<br>of undefiled confiicts.
<br>3	But the multiplied brood of the wicked shall not thrive, and bastard slips shall not take deep root, nor any fast foundation.
<br>4	And if they flourish in branches for a time, yet standing not fast, they shall be shaken with the wind, and through the force of winds they shall be rooted out.
<br>5	For the branches not being perfect, shall be broken, and their fruits shall be unprofitable, and sour to eat, and fit for nothing.
<br>6	For the children that are born of unlawful beds, are witnesses of wickedness against their parents in their trial.
<br>7	But the just man, if he be prevented with death, shall be in rest.
<br>8	For venerable old age is not that of long time, nor counted by the number of years: but the understanding of a man is grey hairs.
<br>9	And a spotless life is old age.
<br>10	He pleased God, and was beloved, and liv- ing among sinners, he was translated.
<br>11	He was taken away, lest wickedness should alter his understanding, or deceit beguile his soul.
<br>12	For the bewitching of vanity obscureth good things, and the wandering of concupiscence
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>overturneth the innocent mind.
<br>13	Being made perfect in a short space, he fulfilled a long time.
<br>14	For his soul pleased God: therefore he has- tened to bring him out of the midst of iniquities: but the people see this, and understand not, nor lay up such things in their hearts:
<br>15	That the grace of God, and his mercy is with his saints, and that he hath respect to his chosen.
<br>16	But the just that is dead, condemneth the wicked that are living, and youth soon ended, the long life of the unjust.
<br>17	For they shall see the end of the wise man, and it shall not understand what God hath de- signed for him, and why the Lord hath set him in safety.
<br>18	They shall see him, and shall despise him: but the Lord shall laugh them to scorn.
<br>19	And they shall fall after this without hon- our, and be a reproach among the dead for ever: for he shall burst them puffed up and speechless, and shall shake them from the foundations, and they shall be utterly laid waste: they shall be in sorrow, and their memory shall perish.
<br>20	They shall come with fear at the thought of their sins, and their iniquities shall stand against them to convict them.
<br>
<br>Chapter 5
<br>Then shall the just stand with great constancy against those that have afflicted them, and taken away their labours.
<br>2	These seeing it, shall be troubled with terri- ble fear, and shall be amazed at the suddenness of their unexpected salvation,
<br>3	Saying within themselves, repenting, and groaning for anguish of spirit: These are they,
<br> 
<br>whom we had sometime in derision, and for a parable of reproach.
<br>4	We fools esteemed their life madness, and their end without honour.
<br>5	Behold, how they are numbered among the children of God, and their lot is among the saints.
<br>6	Therefore we have erred from the way of truth, and the light of justice hath not shined unto us, and the sun of understanding hath not risen upon us.
<br>7	We wearied ourselves in the way of iniq- uity and destruction, and have walked through hard ways, but the way of the Lord we have not known.
<br>8	What hath pride profited us? or what ad- vantage hath the boasting of riches brought us?
<br>9	All those things are passed away like a shadow, and like a post that runneth on,
<br>10	And as a ship, that passeth through the waves: whereof when it is gone by, the trace cannot be found. nor the path of its keel in the waters:
<br>11	Or as when a bird flieth through the air, of the passage of which no mark can be found, but only the sound of the wings beating the light air, and parting it by the force of her flight: she moved her wings, and hath flown through, and there is no mark found afterwards of her way:
<br>12	Or as when an arrow is shot at a mark, the divided air quickly cometh together again, so that the passage thereof is not known:
<br>13	So we also being born, forthwith ceased to be: and have been able to shew no mark of virtue: but are consumed in our wickedness.
<br>14	Such things as these the sinners said in hell:
<br>15	For the hope of the wicked is as dust, which is blown away with the wind, and as a thin froth which is dispersed by the storm: and a smoke that is scattered abroad by the wind: and as the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>remembrance of a guest of one day that passeth by.
<br>16	But the just shall live for evermore: and their reward is with the Lord, and the care of them with the most High.
<br>17	Therefore shall they receive a kingdom of glory, and a crown of beauty at the hand of the Lord: for with his right hand he will cover them, and with his holy arm he will defend them.
<br>18	And his zeal will take armour, and he will arm the creature for the revenge of his enemies. 19 He will put on justice as a breastplate, and
<br>will take true judgment instead of a helmet:
<br>20 He will take equity for an invincible shield: 21 And he will sharpen his severe wrath for a spear, and the whole world shall fight with him
<br>against the unwise.
<br>22	Then shafts of lightning shall go directly from the clouds, as from a bow well bent, they shall be shot out, and shall fly to the mark.
<br>23	And thick hail shall be cast upon them from the stone casting wrath: the water of the sea shall rage against them, and the rivers shall run together in a terrible manner.
<br>24	A mighty wind shall stand up against them, and as a whirlwind shall divide them: and their iniquity shall bring all the earth to a desert, and wickedness shall overthrow the thrones of the mighty.
<br>
<br>Chapter 6
<br>Wisdom is better than strength: and a wise man is better than a strong man.
<br>2 Hear, therefore, ye kings, and understand, learn ye that are judges of the ends of the earth. 3 Give ear, you that rule the people, and that
<br>please yourselves in multitudes of nations:
<br>4 For power is given you by the Lord, and
<br> 
<br>strength by the most High, who will examine your works: and search out your thoughts:
<br>6 Because being ministers of his kingdom, you have not judged rightly, nor kept the law of jus- tice, nor walked according to the will of God.
<br>6	Horribly and speedily will he appear to you: for a most severe judgment shall be for them that bear rule.
<br>7	For to him that is little, mercy is granted: but the mighty shall be mightily tormented.
<br>8	For God will not except any man’s person, neither will he stand in awe of any man’s great- ness: for he made the little and the great, and he hath equally care of all.
<br>9	But a greater punishment is ready for the more mighty.
<br>10	To you, therefore, O kings, are these my words, that you may learn wisdom, and not fall from it.
<br>11	For they that have kept just things justly, shall be justified: and they that have learned these things, shall find what to answer.
<br>12	Covet ye, therefore, my words, and love them, and you shall have instruction.
<br>13	Wisdom is glorious, and never fadeth away, and is easily seen by them that love her, and is found by them that seek her.
<br>14	She preventeth them that covet her, so that she first sheweth herself unto them.
<br>15	He that awaketh early to seek her, shall not labour: for he shall find her sitting at his door.
<br>16	To think, therefore, upon her, is perfect understanding: and he that watcheth for her, shall quickly be secure.
<br>17	For she goeth about seeking such as are worthy of her, and she sheweth herself to them cheerfully in the ways, and meeteth them with all providence.
<br>18	For the beginning of her is the most true desire of discipline.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>19	And the care of discipline is love: and love is the keeping of her laws: and the keeping of her laws is the firm foundation of incorruption:
<br>20	And incorruption bringeth near to God.
<br>21	Therefore the desire of wisdom bringeth to the everlasting kingdom.
<br>22	If then your delight be in thrones, and scep- tres, O ye kings of the people, love wisdom, that you may reign for ever.
<br>23	Love the light of wisdom, all ye that bear rule over peoples.
<br>24	Now what wisdom is, and what was her origin, I will declare: and I will not hide from you the mysteries of God, but will seek her out from the beginning of her birth, and bring the knowledge of her to light, and will not pass over the truth:
<br>25	Neither will I go with consuming envy: for such a man shall not be partaker of wisdom.
<br>26	Now the multitude of the wise is the wel- fare of the whole world: and a wise king is the upholding of the people.
<br>27	Receive, therefore, instruction by my words, and it shall be profitable to you.
<br>
<br>Chapter 7
<br>
<br>I myself am a mortal man, like all others, and of the race of him, that was first made of the earth, and in the womb of my mother I was fashioned to be flesh.
<br>2	In the time of ten months I was compacted in blood, of the seed of man, and the pleasure of sleep concurring.
<br>3	And being born, I drew in the common air, and fell upon the earth, that is made alike, and the first voice which I uttered was crying, as all others do.
<br> 
<br>4	I was nursed in swaddling clothes, and with great cares.
<br>5	For none of the kings had any other begin- ning of birth.
<br>6	For all men have one entrance into life, and the like going out.
<br>7	Wherefore I wished, and understanding was given me: and I called upon God, and the spirit of wisdom came upon me:
<br>8	And I preferred her before kingdoms and thrones, and esteemed riches nothing in compar- ison of her.
<br>9	Neither did I compare unto her any precious stone: for all gold, in comparison of her, is as a little sand; and silver, in respect to her, shall be counted as clay.
<br>10	I loved her above health and beauty, and chose to have her instead of light: for her light cannot be put out.
<br>11	Now all good things came to me together with her, and innumerable riches through her hands,
<br>12	And I rejoiced in all these: for this wisdom went before me, and I knew not that she was the mother of them all.
<br>13	Which I have learned without guile, and communicate without envy, and her riches I hide not.
<br>14	For she is an infinite treasure to men: which they that use, become the friends of God, being commended for the gifts of discipline.
<br>15	And God hath given to me to speak as I would, and to conceive thoughts worthy of those things that are given me: because he is the guide of wisdom, and the director of the wise:
<br>16	For in his hand are both we, and our words, and all wisdom, and the knowledge and skill of works.
<br>17	For he hath given me the true knowledge of the things that are: to know the disposition of
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>the whole world, and the virtues of the elements, 18 The beginning, and ending, and midst of the times, the alterations of their courses, and
<br>the changes of seasons,
<br>19	The revolutions of the year, and the dispo- sitions of the stars,
<br>20	The natures of living creatures, and rage of wild beasts, the force of winds, and reasonings of men, the diversities of plants, and the virtues of roots,
<br>21	And all such things as are hid, and not foreseen, I have learned: for wisdom, which is the worker of all things, taught me.
<br>22	For in her is the spirit of understanding; holy, one, manifold, subtile, eloquent, active, un- defiled, sure, sweet, loving that which is good, quick, which nothing hindereth, beneficent,
<br>23	Gentle, kind, steadfast, assured, secure, having all power, overseeing all things, and con- taining all spirits: intelligible, pure, subtile:
<br>24	For wisdom is more active than all active things; and reacheth everywhere, by reason of her purity.
<br>25	For she is a vapour of the power of God, and a certain pure emmanation of the glory of the Almighty God: and therefore no defiled thing cometh into her.
<br>26	For she is the brightness of eternal light, and the unspotted mirror of God’s majesty, and the image of his goodness.
<br>27	And being but one, she can do all things: and remaining in herself the same, she reneweth all things, and through nations conveyeth herself into holy souls, she maketh the friends of God and prophets.
<br>28	For God loveth none but him that dwelleth with wisdom.
<br>29	For she is more beautiful than the sun, and above all the order of the stars: being compared with the light, she is found before it.
<br> 
<br>30	For after this cometh night, but no evil can overcome wisdom.
<br>
<br>Chapter 8
<br>She reacheth, therefore, from end to end might- ily, and ordereth all things sweetly.
<br>2	Her have I loved, and have sought her out from my youth, and have desired to take for my spouse, and I became a lover of her beauty.
<br>3	She glorifieth her nobility by being conver- sant with God: yea, and the Lord of all things hath loved her.
<br>4	For it is she that teacheth the knowledge of God and is the chooser of his works.
<br>5	And if riches be desired in life, what is richer than wisdom, which maketh all things?
<br>6	And if sense do work: who is a more artful worker than she of those things that are?
<br>7	And if a man love justice: her labours have great virtues: for she teacheth temperance, and prudence, and justice, and fortitude, which are such things as men can have nothing more prof- itable in life.
<br>8	And if a man desire much knowledge: she knoweth things past, and judgeth of things to come: she knoweth the subtilties of speeches, and the solutions of arguments: she knoweth signs and wonders before they be done, and the events of times and ages.
<br>9	I purposed, therefore, to take her to me to live with me: knowing that she will communicate to me of her good things, and will be a comfort in my cares and grief.
<br>10	For her sake I shall have glory among the multitude, and honour with the ancients, though I be young:
<br>11	And I shall be found of a quick conceit in judgment, and shall be admired in the sight of
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>the mighty, and the faces of princes shall wonder at me.
<br>12	They shall wait for me when I hold my peace, and they shall look upon me when I speak; and if I talk much, they shall lay their hands on their mouth.
<br>13	Moreover, by the means of her I shall have immortality: and shall leave behind me an ever- lasting memory to them that come after me.
<br>14	I shall set the people in order: and nations shall be subject to me.
<br>15	Terrible kings hearing, shall be afraid of me: among the multitude I shall be found good, and valiant in war.
<br>16	When I go into my house, I shall repose myself with her: for her conversation hath no bitterness, nor her company any tediousness, but joy and gladness.
<br>17	Thinking these things with myself, and pondering them in my heart, that to be allied to wisdom is immortality,
<br>18	And that there is great delight in her friendship, and inexhaustible riches in the works of her hands, and in the exercise of conference with her, wisdom, and glory in the communica- tion of her words: I went about seeking, that I might take her to myself.
<br>19	And I was a witty child, and had received a good soul.
<br>20	And whereas I was more good, I came to a body undefiled.
<br>21	And as I knew that I could not otherwise be continent, except God gave it, and this also was a point of wisdom, to know whose gift it was, I went to the Lord, and besought him, and said with my whole heart:
<br> 
<br>Chapter 9
<br>God of my fathers, and Lord of mercy, who hast made all things with thy word,
<br>2	And by thy wisdom hast appointed man, that he should have dominion over the creature that was made by thee,
<br>3	That he should order the world according to equity and justice, and execute justice with an upright heart:
<br>4	Give me wisdom, that sitteth by thy throne, and cast me not off from among thy children:
<br>5	For I am thy servant, and the son of thy handmaid, a weak man, and of short time, and falling short of the understanding of judgment and laws.
<br>6	For if one be perfect among the children of men, yet if thy wisdom be not with him, he shall be nothing regarded.
<br>7	Thou hast chosen me to be king of thy peo- ple, and a judge of thy sons and daughters:
<br>8	And hast commanded me to build a tem- ple on thy holy mount, and an altar in the city of thy dwelling place, a resemblance of thy holy tabernacle, which thou hast prepared from the beginning:
<br>9	And thy wisdom with thee, which knoweth thy works, which then also was present when thou madest the world, and knew what was agreeable to thy eyes, and what was right in thy commandments.
<br>10	Send her out of thy holy heaven, and from the throne of thy majesty, that she may be with me, and may labour with me, that I may know what is acceptable with thee:
<br>11	For she knoweth and understandeth all things, and shall lead me soberly in my works, and shall preserve me by her power.
<br>12	So shall my works be acceptable, and I shall govern thy people justly, and shall be worthy of
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>the throne of my father.
<br>13	For who among men is he that can know the counsel of God? or who can think what the will of God is?
<br>14	For the thoughts of mortal men are fearful, and our counsels uncertain.
<br>15	For the corruptible body is a load upon the soul, and the earthly habitation presseth down the mind that museth upon many things.
<br>16	And hardly do we guess aright at things that are upon earth: and with labour do we find the things that are before us. But the things that are in heaven, who shall search out?
<br>17	And who shall know thy thought, except thou give wisdom, and send thy holy Spirit from above:
<br>18	And so the ways of them that are upon earth may be corrected, and men may learn the things that please thee?
<br>19	For by wisdom they were healed, whosoever have pleased thee, O Lord, from the beginning.
<br>
<br>Chapter 10
<br>She preserved him, that was first formed by God, the father of the world, when he was created alone,
<br>2	And she brought him out of his sin, and gave him power to govern all things.
<br>3	But when the unjust went away from her in his anger, he perished by the fury wherewith he murdered his brother.
<br>4	For whose cause, when water destroyed the earth, wisdom healed it again, directing the course of the just by contemptible wood.
<br>5	Moreover, when the nations had conspired together to consent to wickedness, she knew the just, and preserved him without blame to God, and kept him strong against the compassion for
<br> 
<br>his son.
<br>6	She delivered the just man, who fled from the wicked that were perishing, when the fire came down upon Pentapolis:
<br>7	Whose land, for a testimony of their wicked- ness, is desolate, and smoketh to this day, and the trees bear fruits that ripen not, and a stand- ing pillar of salt is a monument of an incredulous soul.
<br>8	For regarding not wisdom, they did not only slip in this, that they were ignorant of good things; but they left also unto men a memorial of their folly, so that in the things in which they sinned, they could not so much as lie hid.
<br>9	But wisdom hath delivered from sorrow them that attend upon her.
<br>10	She conducted the just, when he fled from his brother’s wrath, through the right ways, and shewed him the kingdom of God, and gave him the knowledge of the holy things, made him honourable in his labours, and accomplished his labours.
<br>11	In the deceit of them that overreached him, she stood by him, and made him honourable.
<br>12	She kept him safe from his enemies, and she defended him from seducers, and gave him a strong conflict, that he might overcome, and know that wisdom is mightier than all.
<br>13	She forsook not the just when he was sold, but delivered him from sinners: she went down with him into the pit.
<br>14	And in bands she left him not, till she brought him the sceptre of the kingdom, and power against those that oppressed him: and shewed them to be liars that had accused him, and gave him everlasting glory.
<br>15	She delivered the just people, and blame- less seed, from the nations that oppressed them. 16 She entered into the soul of the servant of God and stood against dreadful kings in wonders
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>and signs.
<br>17	And she rendered to the just the wages of their labours, and conducted them in a wonder- ful way: and she was to them for a covert by day, and for the light of stars by night:
<br>18	And she brought them through the Red Sea, and carried them over through a great wa- ter.
<br>19	But their enemies she drowned in the sea, and from the depth of hell she brought them out. Therefore the just took the spoils of the wicked. 20 And they sung to thy holy name, O Lord, and they praised with one accord thy victorious
<br>hand.
<br>21 For wisdom opened the mouth of the dumb, and made the tongues of infants eloquent.
<br>
<br>Chapter 11
<br>
<br>She prospered their works in the hands of the holy prophet.
<br>2	They went through wildernesses that were not inhabited, and in desert places they pitched their tents.
<br>3	They stood against their enemies, and re- venged themselves of their adversaries.
<br>4	They were thirsty, and they called upon thee, and water was given them out of the high rock, and a refreshment of their thirst out of the hard stone.
<br>5	For by what things their enemies were pun- ished, when their drink failed them, while the children of Israel abounded therewith, and re- joiced:
<br>6	By the same things they in their need were benefited.
<br>7	For instead of a fountain of an ever running river, thou gavest human blood to the unjust.
<br> 
<br>8	And whilst they were diminished for a man- ifest reproof of their murdering the infants, thou gavest to thine abundant water unlooked for:
<br>9	Shewing by the thirst that was then, how thou didst exalt thine, and didst kill their ad- versaries.
<br>10	For when they were tried, and chastised with mercy, they knew how the wicked were judged with wrath, and tormented.
<br>11	For thou didst admonish and try them as a father: but the others, as a severe king, thou didst examine and condemn.
<br>12	For whether absent or present, they were tormented alike.
<br>13	For a double affliction came upon them, and a groaning for the remembrance of things past.
<br>14	For when they heard that by their punish- ments the others were benefited, they remem- bered the Lord, wondering at the end of what was come to pass.
<br>15	For whom they scorned before, when he was thrown out at the time of his being wickedly exposed to perish, him they admired in the end, when they saw the event: their thirsting being unlike to that of the just.
<br>16	But for the foolish devices of their in- iqnity, because some being deceived worshipped dumb serpents and worthless beasts, thou didst send upon them a multitude of dumb beasts for vengeance:
<br>17	That they might know that by what things a man sinneth, by the same also he is tormented. 18 For thy almighty hand, which made the world of matter without form, was not unable to send upon them a multitude of bears, or fierce
<br>lions,
<br>19 Or unknown beasts of a new kind, full of rage; either breathing out a fiery vapour, or send- ing forth a stinking smoke, or shooting horrible
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>sparks out of their eyes:
<br>20	Whereof not only the hurt might be able to destroy them, but also the very sight might kill them through fear.
<br>21	Yea, and without these, they might have been slain with one blast, persecuted by their own deeds, and scattered by the breath of thy power: but thou hast ordered all things in mea- sure, and number, and weight.
<br>22	For great power always belonged to thee alone: and who shall resist the strength of thy arm?
<br>23	For the whole world before thee is as the least grain of the balance, and as a drop of the morning dew, that falleth down upon tho earth.
<br>24	But thou hast mercy upon all, because thou canst do all things, and overlookest the sins of men for the sake of repentance.
<br>25	For thou lovest all things that are, and hat- est none of the things which thou hast made: for thou didst not appoint, or make any thing hating it.
<br>26	And how could any thing endure, if thou wouldst not? or be preserved, if not called by thee?
<br>27	But thou sparest all: because they are thine, O Lord, who lovest souls.
<br>
<br>Chapter 12
<br>O how good and sweet is thy Spirit, O Lord, in all things!
<br>2	And therefore thou chastisest them that err, by little and little: and admonishest them, and speakest to them, concerning the things wherein they offend: that leaving their wickedness, they may believe in thee, O Lord.
<br>3	For those ancient inhabitants of thy holy land, whom thou didst abhor,
<br> 
<br>4	Because they did works hateful to thee by their sorceries, and wicked sacrifices,
<br>5	And those merciless murderers of their own children, and eaters of men’s bowels, and devour- ers of blood from the midst of thy consecration, 6 And those parents sacrificing with their own hands helpless souls, it was thy will to destroy
<br>by the hands of our parents,
<br>7	That the land which of all is most dear to thee, might receive a worthy colony of the chil- dren of God.
<br>8	Yet even those thou sparedst as men, and didst send wasps forerunners of thy host, to de- stroy them by little and little.
<br>9	Not that thou wast unable to bring the wicked under the just by war, or by cruel beasts, or with one rough word to destroy them at once: 10 But executing thy judgments by degrees, thou gavest them place of repentance, not be- ing ignorant that they were a wicked generation, and their malice natural, and that their thought
<br>could never be changed.
<br>11	For it was a cursed seed from the beginning: neither didst thou for fear of any one give pardon to their sins.
<br>12	For who shall say to thee: What hast thou done? or who shall withstand thy judgment? or who shall come before thee to be a revenger of wicked men? or who shall accuse thee, if the nations perish, which thou hast made ?
<br>13	For there is no other God but thou, who hast care of all, that thou shouldst shew that thou dost not give judgment unjustly.
<br>14	Neither shall king, nor tyrant, in thy sight inquire about them whom thou hast destroyed.
<br>15	For so much then, as thou art just, thou or- derest all things justly: thinking it not agreeable to the power, to condemn him who deserveth not to be punished.
<br>16	For thy power is the beginning of justice:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>and because thou art Lord of all, thou makest thyself gracious to all.
<br>17	For thou shewest thy power, when men will not believe thee to be absolute in power, and thou convincest the boldness of them that know thee not.
<br>18	But thou being master of power, judgest with tranquillity, and with great favour disposest of us: for thy power is at hand when thou wilt.
<br>19	But thou hast taught thy people by such works, that they must be just and humane, and hast made thy children to be of a good hope: because in judging, thou givest place for repen- tance for sins.
<br>20	For if thou didst punish the enemies of thy servants, and that deserved to die, with so great deliberation, giving them time and place whereby they might be changed from their wickedness:
<br>21	With what circumspection hast thou judged thy own children, to whose parents thou hast sworn, and made covenants of good promises?
<br>22	Therefore whereas thou chastisest us, thou scourgest our enemies very many ways, to the end that when we judge we may think on thy goodness: and when we are judged, we may hope for thy mercy.
<br>23	Wherefore thou hast also greatly tor- mented them, who, in their life, have lived fool- ishly and unjustly, by the same things which they worshipped.
<br>24	For they went astray for a long time in the ways of error, holding those things for gods which are the most worthless among beasts, liv- ing after the manner of children without under- standing.
<br>25	Therefore thou hast sent a judgment upon them, as senseless children, to mock them.
<br>26	But they that were not amended by mock-
<br> 
<br>eries and reprehensions, experienced the worthy judgment of God.
<br>27	For seeing, with indignation, that they suf- fered by those very things which they took for gods, when they were destroyed by the same, they acknowledged him the true God, whom in time past they denied that they knew: for which cause the end also of their condemnation came upon them.
<br>
<br>Chapter 13
<br>But all men are vain, in whom there is not the knowledge of God: and who by these good things that are seen, could not understand him that is, neither by attending to the works have acknowl- edged who was the workman:
<br>2	But have imagined either the fire, or the wind, or the swift air, or the circle of the stars, or the great water, or the sun and moon, to be the gods that rule the world.
<br>3	With whose beauty, if they, being delighted, took them to be gods: let them know how much the Lord of them is more beautiful than they: for the first author of beauty made all those things. 4 Or if they admired their power, and their effects, let them understand by them, that he
<br>that made them, is mightier than they:
<br>5	For by the greatness of the beauty, and of the creature, the creator of them may be seen, so as to be known thereby.
<br>6	But yet as to these they are less to be blamed. For they perhaps err, seeking God, and desirous to find him.
<br>7	For being conversant among his works, they search: and they are persuaded that the things are good which are seen.
<br>8	But then again they are not to be pardoned.
<br>9	For if they were able to know so much as to
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>make a judgment of the world: how did they not more easily find out the Lord thereof?
<br>11	Or if an artist, a carpenter, hath cut down a tree proper for his use in the wood, and skil- fully taken off all the bark thereof, and with his art, diligently formeth a vessel profitable for the common uses of life,
<br>12	And useth the chips of his work to dress his meat:
<br>13	And taking what was left thereof, which is good for nothing, being a crooked piece of wood, and full of knots, carveth it diligently when he hath nothing else to do, and by the skill of his art fashioneth it, and maketh it like the image of a man:
<br>14	Or the resemblance of some beast, laying it over with vermilion, and painting it red, and covering every spot that is in it:
<br>15	And maketh a convenient dwelling place for it, and setting it in a wall, and fastening it with iron,
<br>16	Providing for it, lest it should fall, knowing that it is unable to help itself: for it is an image, and hath need of help.
<br>17	And then maketh prayer to it, enquiring concerning his substance, and his children, or his marriage. And he is not ashamed to speak to that which hath no life:
<br>18	And for health he maketh supplication to the weak, and for life prayeth to that which is dead, and for help calleth upon that which is unprofitable:
<br>19	And for a good journey he petitioneth him that cannot walk: and for getting, and for work- ing, and for the event of all things he asketh him that is unable to do any thing.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 14
<br>
<br>Again, another designing to sail, and beginning to make his voyage through the raging waves, calleth upon a piece of wood more frail than the wood that carrieth him.
<br>2	For this the desire of gain devised, and the workman built it by his skill.
<br>3	But thy providence, O Father, governeth it: for thou hast made a way even in the sea, and a most sure path among the waves,
<br>4	Shewing that thou art able to save out of all things, yea, though a man went to sea without art.
<br>5	But that the works of thy wisdom might not be idle: therefore men also trust their lives even to a little wood, and passing over the sea by ship, are saved.
<br>6	And from the beginning also, when the proud giants perished, the hope of the world flee- ing to a vessel, which was governed by thy hand, left to the world seed of generation.
<br>7	For blessed is the wood, by which justice cometh
<br>8	But the idol that is made by hands, is cursed, as well it, as he that made it: he because he made it; and it because being frail it is called a god.
<br>9	But to God the wicked and his wickedness are hateful alike.
<br>10	For that which is made, together with him that made it, shall suffer torments.
<br>11	Therefore there shall be no respect had even to the idols of the Gentiles: because the creatures of God are turned to an abomination, and a temptation to the souls of men, and a snare to the feet of the unwise.
<br>12	For the beginning of fornication is the de- vising of idols: and the invention of them is the corruption of life.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>13	For neither were they from the beginning, neither shall they be for ever.
<br>14	For by the vanity of men they came into the world: and therefore they shall be found to come shortly to an end.
<br>15	For a father being afflicted with bitter grief, made to himself the image of his son, who was quickly taken away: and him who then had died as a man, he began now to worship as a god, and appointed him rites and sacrifices among his servants.
<br>16	Then, in process of time, wicked custom prevailing, this error was kept as a law, and stat- ues were worshipped by the commandment of tyrants.
<br>17	And those whom men could not honour in presence, because they dwelt far off, they brought their resemblance from afar, and made an express image of the king, whom they had a mind to honour: that by this their diligence, they might honour as present, him that was ab- sent.
<br>18	And to the worshipping of these, the sin- gular diligence also of the artificer helped to set forward the ignorant.
<br>19	For he being willing to please him that em- ployed him, laboured with all his art to make the resemblance in the best manner.
<br>20	And the multitude of men, carried away by the beauty of the work, took him now for a god, that little before was but honoured as a man.
<br>21	And this was the occasion of deceiving hu- man life: for men serving either their affection, or their kings, gave the incommunicable name to stones and wood.
<br>22	And it was not enough for them to err about the knowledge of God, but whereas they lived in a great war of ignorance, they call so many and so great evils peace.
<br>23	For either they sacrifice their own children,
<br> 
<br>or use hidden sacrifices, or keep watches full of madness,
<br>24	So that now they neither keep life, nor mar- riage undefiled, but one killeth another through envy, or grieveth him by adultery:
<br>25	And all things are mingled together, blood, murder, theft, and dissimulation, corruption and unfaithfulness, tumults and perjury, disquieting of the good,
<br>26	Forgetfulness of God, defiling of souls, changing of nature, disorder in marriage, and the irregularity of adultery and uncleanness.
<br>27	For the worship of abominable idols is the cause, and the beginning and end of all evil.
<br>28	For either they are mad when they are merry: or they prophesy lies, or they live un- justly, or easily forswear themselves.
<br>29	For whilst they trust in idols, which are without life, though they swear amiss, they look not to be hurt.
<br>30	But for both these things they shall be justly punished, because they have thought not well of God, giving heed to idols, and have sworn unjustly, in guile despising justice.
<br>31	For it is not the power of them, by whom they swear, but the just vengeance of sinners al- ways punisheth the transgression of the unjust.
<br>
<br>Chapter 15
<br>But thou, our God, art gracious and true, pa- tient, and ordering all things in mercy.
<br>2	For if we sin, we are thine, knowing thy greatness: and if we sin not, we know that we are counted with thee.
<br>3	For to know thee is perfect justice: and to know thy justice, and thy power, is the root of immortality.
<br>4	For the invention of mischievous men hath
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>not deceived us, nor the shadow of a picture, a fruitless labour, a graven figure with divers colours,
<br>5	The sight whereof enticeth the fool to lust after it, and he loveth the lifeless figure of a dead image.
<br>6	The lovers of evil things deserve to have no better things to trust in, both they that make them, and they that love them, and they that worship them.
<br>7	The potter also tempering soft earth, with labour fashioneth every vessel for our service, and of the same clay he maketh both vessels that are for clean uses, and likewise such as serve to the contrary: but what is the use of these vessels, the potter is the judge.
<br>8	And of the same clay by a vain labour he maketh a god:  he who a little before was made of earth himself, and a little after returneth to the same out of which he was taken, when his life, which was lent him, shall be called for again.
<br>9	But his care is, not that he shall labour, nor that his life is short, but he striveth with the goldsmiths and silversmiths: and he endeav- oureth to do like the workers in brass, and coun- teth it a glory to make vain things.
<br>10	For his heart is ashes, and his hope vain earth and his life more base than clay:
<br>11	Forasmuch as he knew not his maker, and him that inspired into him the soul that worketh, and that breathed into him a living spirit.
<br>12	Yea, and they have counted our life a pas- time and the business of life to be gain, and that we must be getting every way, even out of evil.
<br>13	For that man knoweth that he offendeth above all others, who of earthly matter maketh brittle vessels, and graven gods.
<br>14	But all the enemies of thy people that hold them in subjection, are foolish, and unhappy, and proud beyond measure:
<br> 
<br>15	For they have esteemed all the idols of the heathens for gods, which neither have the use of eyes to see, nor noses to draw breath, nor ears to hear, nor fingers of hands to handle, and as for their feet, they are slow to walk.
<br>16	For man made them: and he that bor- roweth his own breath, fashioned them. For no man can make a god like to himself.
<br>17	For being mortal himself, he formeth a dead thing with his wicked hands. For he is bet- ter than they whom he worshippeth, because he indeed hath lived, though he were mortal, but they never.
<br>18	Moreover, they worship also the vilest crea- tures: but things without sense, compared to these, are worse than they.
<br>19	Yea, neither by sight can any man see good of these beasts. But they have fled from the praise of God, and from his blessing.
<br>
<br>Chapter 16
<br>For these things, and by the like things to these, they were worthily punished, and were destroyed by a multitude of beasts.
<br>2	Instead of which punishment, dealiug well with thy people, thou gavest them their desire of delicious food, of a new taste, preparing for them quails for their meat:
<br>3	To the end, that they indeed desiring food, by means of those things that were shewn and sent among them, might loath even that which was necessary to satisfy their desire. But these, after suffering want for a short time, tasted a new meat.
<br>4	For it was requisite that inevitable de- struction should come upon them that exercised tyranny: but to these it should only be shewn how their enemies were destroyed.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>5	For when the fierce rage of beasts came upon these, they were destroyed by the bitings of crooked serpents.
<br>6	But thy wrath endured not for ever, but they were troubled for a short time for their correc- tion, having a sign of salvation, to put them in remembrance of the commandment of thy law.
<br>7	For he that turned to it, was not healed by that which he saw, but by thee, the Saviour of all.
<br>8	And in this thou didst shew to our enemies, that thou art he who deliverest from all evil.
<br>9	For the bitings of locusts, and of flies, killed them, and there was found no remedy for their life: because they were worthy to be destroyed by such things.
<br>10	But not even the teeth of venomous ser- pents overcame thy children: for thy mercy came and healed them.
<br>11	For they were examined for the remem- brance of thy words, and were quickly healed, lest falling into deep forgetfulness, they might not be able to use thy help.
<br>12	For it was neither herb, nor mollifying plas- ter, that healed them, but thy word, O Lord, which healeth all things.
<br>13	For it is thou, O Lord, that hast power of life and death, and leadest down to the gates of death, and bringest back again:
<br>14	A man indeed killeth through malice, and when the spirit is gone forth, it shall not re- turn, neither shall he call back the soul that is received:
<br>15	But it is impossible to escape thy hand:
<br>16	For the wicked that denied to know thee, were scourged by the strength of thy arm, being persecuted by strange waters, and hail, and rain, and consumed by fire.
<br>17	And which was wonderful, in water, which extinguisheth all things, the fire had more force:
<br> 
<br>for the world fighteth for the just.
<br>18	For at one time the fire was mitigated, that the beasts which were sent against the wicked might not be burnt, but that they might see, and perceive that they were persecuted by the judgment of God.
<br>19	And at another time the fire, above its own power, burnt in the midst of water, to destroy the fruits of a wicked land.
<br>20	Instead of which things, thou didst feed thy people with the food of angels, and gavest them bread from heaven, prepared without labour; having in it all that is delicious, and the sweet- ness of every taste.
<br>21	For thy sustenance shewed thy sweetness to thy children, and serving every man’s will, it was turned to what every man liked.
<br>22	But snow and ice endured the force of fire, and melted not: that they might know that the fire, burning in the hail, and flashing in the rain, destroyed the fruits of the enemies.
<br>23	But this same again, that the just might be nourished, did even forget its own strength.
<br>24	For the creature serving thee, the Creator, is made fierce against the unjust for their pun- ishment: and abateth its strength for the benefit of them that trust in thee.
<br>25	Therefore even then it was transformed into all things, and was obedient to thy grace, that nourisheth all, according to the will of them that desired it of thee:
<br>26	That thy children, O Lord, whom thou lovedst, might know that it is not the growing of fruits that nourisheth men, but thy word pre- serveth them that believe in thee.
<br>27	For that which could not be destroyed by fire, being warmed with a little sunbeam, presently melted away:
<br>28	That it might be known to all, that we ought to prevent the sun to bless thee, and adore
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>thee at the dawning of the light.
<br>29	For the hope of the unthankful shall melt away as the winter’s ice, and shall run off as unprofitable water.
<br>
<br>Chapter 17
<br>For thy judgments, O Lord, are great, and thy words cannot be expressed: therefore undisci- plined souls have erred.
<br>2	For while the wicked thought to be able to have dominion over the holy nation, they them- selves being fettered with the bonds of darkness, and a long night, shut up in their houses, lay there exiled from the eternal providence.
<br>3	And while they thought to lie hid in their obscure sins, they were scattered under a dark veil of forgetfullness, being horribly afraid, and troubled with exceeding great astonishment.
<br>4	For neither did the den that held them, keep them from fear: for noises coming down trou- bled them, and sad visions appearing to them, affrighted them.
<br>5	And no power of fire could give them light, neither could the bright flames of the stars en- lighten that horrible night.
<br>6	But there appeared to them a sudden fire, very dreadful: and being struck with the fear of that face, which was not seen, they thought the things which they saw to be worse:
<br>7	And the delusions of their magic art were put down, and their boasting of wisdom was re- proachfully rebuked.
<br>8	For they who promised to drive away fears and troubles from a sick soul, were sick them- selves of a fear worthy to be laughed at.
<br>9	For though no terrible thing disturbed them: yet being scared with the passing by of beasts, and hissing of serpents, they died for fear and
<br> 
<br>denying that they saw the air, which could by no means be avoided.
<br>10	For whereas wickedness is fearful, it beareth witness of its condemnation: for a troubled conscience always forecasteth grievous things.
<br>11	For fear is nothing else but a yielding up of the succours from thought.
<br>12	And while there is less expectation from within, the greater doth it count the ignorance of that cause which bringeth the torment.
<br>13	But they that during that night, in which nothing could be done, and which came upon them from the lowest and deepest hell, slept the same sleep,
<br>14	Were sometimes molested with the fear of monsters, sometimes fainted away, their soul fail- ing them: for a sudden and unlooked for fear was come upon them.
<br>15	Moreover, if any of them had fallen down, he was kept shut up in prison without irons.
<br>16	For if any one were a husbandman, or a shepherd, or a labourer in the field, and was suddenly overtaken, he endured a necessity from which he could not fly.
<br>17	For they were all bound together with one chain of darkness. Whether it were a whistling wind, or the melodious voice of birds, among the spreading branches of trees, or a fall of water running down with violence,
<br>18	Or the mighty noise of stones tumbling down, or the running that could not be seen of beasts playing together, or the roaring voice of wild beasts, or a rebounding echo from the high- est mountains: these things made them to swoon for fear.
<br>19	For the whole world was enlightened, with a clear light, and none were hindered in their labours.
<br>20	But over them only was spread a heavy
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>night, an image of that darkness which was to come upon them. But they were to themselves more grievous than the darkness.
<br>
<br>Chapter 18
<br>But thy saints had a very great light, and they heard their voice indeed, but did not see their shape. And because they also did not suffer the same things, they glorified thee:
<br>2	And they that before had been wronged, gave thanks, because they were not hurt now: and asked this gift, that there might be a differ- ence.
<br>3	Therefore they received a burning pillar of fire for a guide of the way which they knew not, and thou gavest them a harmless sun of a good entertainment.
<br>4	The others indeed were worthy to be de- prived of light, and imprisoned in darkness, who kept thy children shut up, by whom the pure light of the law was to be given to the world.
<br>5	And whereas they thought to kill the babes of the just: one child being cast forth, and saved to reprove them, thou tookest away a multi- tude of their children, and destroyedst them al- together in a mighty water.
<br>6	For that night was known before by our fa- thers, that assuredly knowing what oaths they had trusted to, they might be of better courage. 7 So thy people received the salvation of the
<br>just, and destruction of the unjust.
<br>8	For as thou didst punish the adversaries so thou didst also encourage and glorify us.
<br>9	For the just children of good men were of- fering sacrifice secretly, and they unanimously ordered a law of justice: that the just should re- ceive both good and evil alike, singing now the praises of the fathers.
<br> 
<br>10	But on the other side there sounded an ill according cry of the enemies, and a lamentable mourning was heard for the children that were bewailed.
<br>11	And the servant suffered the same punish- ment as the master, and a common man suffered in like manner as the king.
<br>12	So all alike had innumerable dead, with one kind of death. Neither were the living sufficient to bury them: for in one moment the noblest offspring of them was destroyed.
<br>13	For whereas they would not believe any thing before by reason of the enchantments, then first upon the destruction of the firstborn, they acknowledged the people to be of God.
<br>14	For while all things were in quiet silence, and the night was in the midst of her course,
<br>15	Thy Almighty word leaped down from heaven from thy royal throne, as a fierce con- queror into the midst of the land of destruction, 16 With a sharp sword carrying thy unfeigned commandment, and he stood and filled all things with death, and standing on the earth, reached
<br>even to heaven.
<br>17	Then suddenly visions of evil dreams trou- bled them, and fears unlooked for came upon them.
<br>18	And one thrown here, another there, half dead, shewed the cause of his death.
<br>19	For the visions that troubled them fore- shewed these things, lest they should perish, and not know why they suffered these evils.
<br>20	But the just also were afterwards touched by an assault of death, and there was a distur- bance of the multitude in the wilderness: but thy wrath did not long continue;
<br>21	For a blameless man made haste to pry for the people, bringing forth the shield of his ministry, prayer, and by incense making suppli- cation, withstood the wrath, and put an end to
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>the calamity, shewing that he was thy servant.
<br>22	And he overcame the disturbance, not by strength of body nor with force of arms, but with a word he subdued him that punished them, al- leging the oath and covenant made with the fa- thers.
<br>23	For when they were now fallen down dead by heaps one upon another, he stood between and stayed the assault, and cut off the way to the living.
<br>24	For in the priestly robe which he wore, was the whole world: and in the four rows of the stones, the glory of the fathers was graven, and thy majesty was written upon the diadem of his head.
<br>26 And to these the destroyer gave place, and was afraid of them: for the proof only of wrath was enough.
<br>
<br>Chapter 19
<br>But as to the wicked, even to the end there came upon them wrath without mercy. For he knew before also what they would do:
<br>2	For when they had given them leave to de- part and had sent them away with great care, they repented and pursued after them.
<br>3	For whilst they were yet mourning, and lamenting at the graves of the dead, they took up another foolish device: and pursued them as fugitives whom they had pressed to be gone:
<br>4	For a necessity, of which they were worthy, brought them to this end: and they lost the re- membrance of those things which had happened, that their punishment might fill up what was wanting to their torments:
<br>5	And that thy people might wonderfully pass through, but they might find a new death.
<br>6	For every creature, according to its kind was
<br> 
<br>fashioned again as from the beginning, obeying thy commandments, that thy children might be kept without hurt.
<br>7	For a cloud overshadowed their camps and where water was before, dry land appeared, and in the Red Sea a way without hindrance, and out of the great deep a springing field:
<br>8	Through which all the nation passed which was protected with thy hand, seeing thy miracles and wonders.
<br>9	For they fed on their food like horses, and they skipped like lambs, praising thee, O Lord, who hadst delivered them.
<br>10	For they were yet mindful of those things which had been done in the time of their sojourn- ing, how the ground brought forth flies instead of cattle, and how the river cast up a multitude of frogs instead of fishes.
<br>11	And at length they saw a new generation of birds, when being led by their appetite, they asked for delicate meats.
<br>12	For to satisfy their desire, the quail came up to them from the sea: and punishments came upon the sinners, not without foregoing signs by the force of thunders: for they suffered justly according to their own wickedness.
<br>13	For they exercised a more detestable in- hospitality than any: others indeed received not strangers unknown to them, but these brought their guests into bondage that had deserved well of them.
<br>14	And not only so, but in another respect also they were worse: for the others against their will received the strangers.
<br>15	But these grievously afflicted them whom they had received with joy, and who lived under the same laws.
<br>16	But they were struck with blindness: as those others were at the doors of the just man, when they were covered with sudden darkness,
<br> 
<br>
<br>and every one sought the passage of his own door.
<br>17	For while the elements are changed in themselves, as in an instrument the sound of the quality is changed, yet all keep their sound: which may clearly be perceived by the very sight. 18 For the things of the land were turned into things of the water: and the things that before
<br>swam in the water passed upon the land.
<br>19	The fire had power in water above its own virtue, and the water forgot its quenching na- ture.
<br>20	On the other side, the flames wasted not the flesh of corruptible animals walking therein, neither did they melt that good food, which was apt to melt as ice. For in all things thou didst magnify thy people, O Lord, and didst honour them, and didst not despise them, but didst as- sist them at all times, and in every place.

<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>All wisdom is from the Lord God, and hath been always with him, and is before all time.
<br>2	Who hath numbered the sand of the sea, and the drops of rain, and the days of the world? Who hath measured the height of heaven, and the breadth of the earth, and the depth of the abyss?
<br>3	Who hath searched out the wisdom of God that goeth before all things?
<br>4	Wisdom hath been created before all things, and the understanding of prudence from ever- lasting.
<br>5	The word of God on high is the fountain of wisdom, and her ways are everlasting command- ments.
<br>6	To whom hath the root of wisdom been re- vealed, and who hath known her wise counsels? 7 To whom hath the discipline of wisdom been revealed and made manifest? and who hath un-
<br>derstood the multiplicity of her steps?
<br>8	There is one most high Creator Almighty, and a powerful king, and greatly to be feared, who sitteth upon his throne, and is the God of dominion.
<br>9	He created her in the Holy Ghost, and saw her, and numbered her, and measured her.
<br>10	And he poured her out upon all his works, and upon all flesh according to his gift, and hath given her to them that love him.
<br>11	The fear of the Lord is honour, and glory,
<br> 
<br>
<br>and gladness, and a crown of joy.
<br>12	The fear of the Lord shall delight the heart, and shall give joy, and gladness, and length of days.
<br>13	With him that feareth the Lord, it shall go well in the latter end, and in the day of his death he shall be blessed.
<br>14	The love of God is honourable wisdom.
<br>15	And they to whom she shall shew herself love her by the sight, and by the knowledge of her great works.
<br>16	The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and was created with the faithful in the womb, it walketh with chosen women, and is known with the just and faithful.
<br>17	The fear of the Lord is the religiousness of knowledge.
<br>18	Religiousness shall keep and justify the heart, it shall give joy and gladness.
<br>19	It shall go well with him that feareth the Lord, and in the days of his end he shall be blessed.
<br>20	To fear God is the fulness of wisdom, and fulness is from the fruits thereof.
<br>21	She shall fill all her house with her increase, and the storehouses with her treasures.
<br>22	The fear of the Lord is a crown of wisdom, filling up peace and the fruit of salvation:
<br>23	And it hath seen, and numbered her: but both are the gifts of God.
<br>24	Wisdom shall distribute knowledge, and understanding of prudence: and exalteth the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>glory of them that hold her.
<br>25	The root of wisdom is to fear the Lord: and the branches thereof are long-lived.
<br>26	In the treasures of wisdom is understand- ing, and religiousness of knowledge: but to sin- ners wisdom is an abomination.
<br>27	The fear of the Lord driveth out sin:
<br>28	For he that is without fear, cannot be jus- tified: for the wrath of his high spirits is his ruin. 29 A patient man shall bear for a time, and
<br>afterwards joy shall be restored to him.
<br>30	A good understanding will hide his words for a time, and the lips of many shall declare his wisdom.
<br>31	In the treasures of wisdom is the significa- tion of discipline:
<br>32	But the worship of God is an abomination to a sinner.
<br>33	Son, if thou desire wisdom, keep justice, and God will give her to thee.
<br>34	For the fear of the Lord is wisdom and discipline: and that which is agreeable to him,
<br>35	Is faith, and meekness: and he will fill up his treasures.
<br>36	Be not incredulous to the fear of the Lord: and come not to him with a double heart.
<br>37	Be not a hypocrite in the sight of men, and let not thy lips be a stumblingblock to thee.
<br>38	Watch over them, lest thou fall, and bring dishonour upon thy soul,
<br>39	And God discover thy secrets, and cast thee down in the midst of the congregation.
<br>40	Because thou camest to the Lord wickedly, and thy heart is full of guile and deceit.
<br>
<br>Chapter 2
<br>Son, when thou comest to the service of God, stand in justice and in fear, and prepare thy soul
<br> 
<br>for temptation.
<br>2	Humble thy heart, and endure: incline thy ear, and receive the words of understanding: and make not haste in the time of clouds.
<br>3	Wait on God with patience: join thyself to God, and endure, that thy life may be increased in the latter end.
<br>4	Take all that shall be brought upon thee: and in thy sorrow endure, and in thy humiliation keep patience.
<br>5	For gold and silver are tried in the fire, but acceptable men in the furnace of humiliation.
<br>6	Believe God, and he will recover thee: and direct thy way, and trust in him. Keep his fear, and grow old therein.
<br>7	Ye that fear the Lord, wait for his mercy: and go not aside from him lest ye fall.
<br>8	Ye that fear the Lord, believe him: and your reward shall not be made void.
<br>9	Ye that fear the Lord hope in him, and mercy shall come to you for your delight.
<br>10	Ye that fear the Lord, love him, and your hearts shall be enlightened.
<br>11	My children behold the generations of men: and know ye that no one hath hoped in the Lord, and hath been confounded.
<br>12	For who hath continued in his command- ment, and hath been forsaken? or who hath called upon him, and he despised him?
<br>13	For God is compassionate and merciful, and will forgive sins in the day of tribulation: and he is a protector to all that seek him in truth. 14 Woe to them that are of a double heart and to wicked lips, and to the hands that do evil, and to the sinner that goeth on the earth two ways. 15 Woe to them that are fainthearted, who believe not God: and therefore they shall not be
<br>protected by him.
<br>16 Woe to them that have lost patience, and that have forsaken the right ways, and have gone
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>aside into crooked ways.
<br>17	And what will they do, when the Lord shall begin to examine?
<br>18	They that fear the Lord, will not be incred- ulous to his word: and they that love him, will keep his way.
<br>19	They that fear the Lord, will seek after the things that are well pleasing to him: and they that love him, shall be filled with his law.
<br>20	They that fear the Lord, will prepare their hearts, and in his sight will sanctify their souls,
<br>21	They that fear the Lord, keep his com- mandments, and will have patience even until his visitation,
<br>22	Saying: If we do not penance, we shall fall into the hands of the Lord, and not into the hands of men.
<br>23	For according to his greatness, so also is his mercy with him.
<br>
<br>Chapter 3
<br>The sons of wisdom are the church of the just: and their generation, obedience and love.
<br>2	Children, hear the judgment of your father, and so do that you may be saved.
<br>3	For God hath made the father honourable to the children: and seeking the judgment of the mothers, hath confirmed it upon the children.
<br>4	He that loveth God, shall obtain pardon for his sins by prayer, and shall refrain himself from them, and shall be heard in the prayer of days.
<br>5	And he that honoureth his mother is as one that layeth up a treasure.
<br>6	He that honoureth his father shall have joy in his own children, and in the day of his prayer he shall be heard.
<br>7	He that honoureth his father shall enjoy a long life: and he that obeyeth the father, shall
<br> 
<br>be a comfort to his mother.
<br>8	He that feareth the Lord, honoureth his par- ents, and will serve them as his masters that brought him into the world.
<br>9	Honour thy father, in work and word, and all patience,
<br>10	That a blessing may come upon thee from him, and his blessing may remain in the latter end.
<br>11	The father’s blessing establisheth the houses of the children: but the mother’s curse rooteth up the foundation.
<br>12	Glory not in the dishonour of thy father: for his shame is no glory to thee.
<br>13	For the glory of a man is from the honour of his father, and a father without honour is the disgrace of the son.
<br>14	Son, support the old age of thy father, and grieve him not in his life;
<br>15	And if his understanding fail, have patience with him, and despise him not when thou art in thy strength: for the relieving of the father shall not be forgotten.
<br>16	For good shall be repaid to thee for the sin of thy mother.
<br>17	And in justice thou shalt be built up, and in the day of affliction thou shalt be remembered: and thy sins shall melt away as the ice in the fair warm weather.
<br>18	Of what an evil fame is he that forsaketh his father: and he is cursed of God that angereth his mother.
<br>19	My son, do thy works in meekness, and thou shalt be beloved above the glory of men.
<br>20	The greater thou art, the more humble thy- self in all things, and thou shalt find grace before God:
<br>21	For great is the power of God alone, and he is honoured by the humble.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>22	Seek not the things that are too high for thee, and search not into things above thy abil- ity: but the things that God hath commanded thee, think on them always, and in many of his works be not curious.
<br>23	For it is not necessary for thee to see with thy eyes those things that are hid.
<br>24	In unnecessary matters be not over curi- ous, and in many of his works thou shalt not be inquisitive.
<br>25	For many things are shewn to thee above the understanding of men.
<br>26	And the suspicion of them hath deceived many, and hath detained their minds in vanity.
<br>27	A hard heart shall fear evil at the last: and he that loveth danger shall perish in it.
<br>28	A heart that goeth two ways shall not have success, and the perverse of heart shall be scan- dalized therein.
<br>29	A wicked heart shall be laden with sorrows, and the sinner will add sin to sin.
<br>30	The congregation of the proud shall not be healed: for the plant of wickedness shall take root in them, and it shall not be perceived.
<br>31	The heart of the wise is understood in wis- dom, and a good ear will hear wisdom with all desire.
<br>32	A wise heart, and which hath understand- ing, will abstain from sins, and in the works of justice shall have success.
<br>33	Water quencheth a flaming fire, and alms resisteth sins:
<br>34	And God provideth for him that sheweth favour: he remembereth him afterwards, and in the time of his fall he shall find a sure stay.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 4
<br>
<br>Son, defraud not the poor of alms, and turn not away thy eyes from the poor.
<br>2	Despise not the hungry soul: and provoke not the poor in his want.
<br>3	Afflict not the heart of the needy, and defer not to gibe to him that is in distress.
<br>4	Reject not the petition of the afflicted: and turn not away thy face from the needy.
<br>5	Turn not away thy eyes from the poor for fear of anger: and leave not to them that ask of thee to curse thee behind thy back.
<br>6	For the prayer of him that curseth thee in the bitterness of his soul, shall be heard, for he that made him will hear him.
<br>7	Make thyself affable to the congregation of the poor, and humble thy soul to the ancient, and bow thy head to a great man.
<br>8	Bow down thy ear cheerfully to the poor, and pay what thou owest, and answer him peaceable words with mildness.
<br>9	Deliver him that suffereth wrong out of the hand of the proud: and be not fainthearted in thy soul.
<br>10	In judging be merciful to the fatherless as a father, and as a husband to their mother.
<br>11	And thou shalt be as the obedient son of the most High, and he will have mercy on thee more than a mother.
<br>12	Wisdom inspireth life into her children, and protecteth them that seek after her, and will go before them in the way of justice.
<br>13	And he that loveth her, loveth life: and they that watch for her, shall embrace her sweet- ness.
<br>14	They that hold her fast, shall inherit life: and whithersoever she entereth, God will give a blessing.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>15	They that serve her, shall be servants to the holy one: and God loveth them that love her.
<br>16	He that hearkeneth to her, shall judge na- tions: and he that looketh upon her, shall remain secure.
<br>17	If he trust to her, he shall inherit her, and his generation shall be in assurance.
<br>18	For she walketh with him in temptation, and at the first she chooseth him.
<br>19	She will bring upon him fear and dread and trial: and she will scourge him with the affliction of her discipline, till she try him by her laws, and trust his soul.
<br>20	Then she will strengthen him, and make a straight way to him, and give him joy,
<br>21	And will disclose her secrets to him, and will heap upon him treasures of knowledge and understanding of justice.
<br>22	But if he go astray, she will forsake him, and deliver him into the hands of his enemy.
<br>23	Son, observe the time, and fly from evil.
<br>24	For thy soul be not ashamed to say the truth.
<br>25	For there is a shame that bringeth sin, and there is a shame that bringeth glory and grace.
<br>26	Accept no person against thy own person, nor against thy soul a lie.
<br>27	Reverence not thy neighbour in his fall:
<br>28	And refrain not to speak in the time of salvation. Hide not thy wisdom in her beauty.
<br>29	For by the tongue wisdom is discerned: and understanding, and knowledge, and learning by the word of the wise, and steadfastness in the works of justice.
<br>30	In nowise speak against the truth, but be ashamed of the lie of thy ignorance.
<br>31	Be not ashamed to confess thy sins, but submit not thyself to every man for sin.
<br> 
<br>32	Resist not against the face of the mighty, and do not strive against the stream of the river. 33 Strive for justice for thy soul, and even unto death fight for justice, and God will overthrow
<br>thy enemies for thee.
<br>34	Be not hasty in thy tongue: and slack and remiss in thy works.
<br>35	Be not as a lion in thy house, terrifying them of thy household, and oppressing them that are under thee.
<br>36	Let not thy hand be stretched out to re- ceive, and shut when thou shouldst give.
<br>
<br>Chapter 5
<br>Set not thy heart upon unjust possessions, and say not: I have enough to live on: for it shall be of no service in the time of vengeance and darkness.
<br>2	Follow not in thy strength the desires of thy heart:
<br>3	And say not: How mighty am I? and who shall bring me under for my deeds? for God will surely take revenge.
<br>4	Say not: I have sinned, and what harm hath befallen me? for the most High is a patient re- warder.
<br>5	Be not without fear about sin forgiven, and add not sin upon sin:
<br>6	And say not: The mercy of the Lord is great, he will have mercy on the multitude of my sins. 7 For mercy and wrath quickly come from him,
<br>and his wrath looketh upon sinners.
<br>8	Delay not to be converted to the Lord, and defer it not from day to day.
<br>9	For his wrath shall come on a sudden, and in the time of vengeance he will destroy thee.
<br>10	Be not anxious for goods unjustly got- ten: for they shall not profit thee in the day
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>of calamity and revenge.
<br>11	Winnow not with every wind, and go not into every way: for so is every sinner proved by a double tongue.
<br>12	Be steadfast in the way of the Lord, and in the truth of thy judgment, and in knowledge, and let the word of peace and justice keep with thee.
<br>13	Be meek to hear the word, that thou mayst understand: and return a true answer with wis- dom.
<br>14	If thou have understanding, answer thy neighbour: but if not, let thy hand be upon thy mouth, lest thou be surprised in an unskilful word, and be confounded.
<br>15	Honour and glory is in the word of the wise, but the tongue of the fool is his ruin.
<br>16	Be not called a whisperer, and be not taken in thy tongue, and confounded.
<br>17	For confusion and repentance is upon a thief, and an evil mark of disgrace upon the dou- ble tongued, but to the whisperer hatred, and enmity, and reproach.
<br>18	Justify alike the small and the great.
<br>
<br>Chapter 6
<br>Instead of a friend become not an enemy to thy neighbour: for an evil man shall inherit reproach and shame, so shall every sinner that is envious and double tongued.
<br>2 Extol not thyself in the thoughts of thy soul like a bull: lest thy strength be quashed by folly, 3 And it eat up thy leaves, and destroy thy fruit, and thou be left as a dry tree in the wilder-
<br>ness.
<br>4	For a wicked soul shall destroy him that hath it, and maketh him to be a joy to his enemies, and shall lead him into the lot of the wicked.
<br> 
<br>5	A sweet word multiplieth friends, and ap- peaseth enemies, and a gracious tongue in a good man aboundeth.
<br>6	Be in peace with many, but let one of a thousand be thy counsellor.
<br>7	If thou wouldst get a friend, try him before thou takest him, and do not credit him easily.
<br>8	For there is a friend for his own occasion, and he will not abide in the day of thy trouble. 9 And there is a friend that turneth to enmity; and there is a friend that will disclose hatred and
<br>strife and reproaches.
<br>10 And there is a friend a companion at the table, and he will not abide in the day of distress. 11 A friend if he continue steadfast, shall be to thee as thyself, and shall act with confidence
<br>among them of thy household.
<br>12	If he humble himself before thee, and hide himself from thy face, thou shalt have unanimous friendship for good.
<br>13	Separate thyself from thy enemies, and take heed of thy friends.
<br>14	A faithful friend is a strong defence: and he that hath found him, hath found a treasure.
<br>15	Nothing can be compared to a faithful friend, and no weight of gold and silver is able to countervail the goodness of his fidelity.
<br>16	A faithful friend is the medicine of life and immortality: and they that fear the Lord, shall find him.
<br>17	He that feareth God, shall likewise have good friendship: because according to him shall his friend be.
<br>18	My son, from thy youth up receive instruc- tion, and even to thy grey hairs thou shalt find wisdom.
<br>19	Come to her as one that plougheth, and soweth, and wait for her good fruits:
<br>20	For in working about her thou shalt labour a little, and shalt quickly eat of her fruits.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>21	How very unpleasant is wisdom to the un- learned, and the unwise will not continue with her.
<br>22	She shall be to them as a mighty stone of trial, and they will cast her from them before it be long.
<br>23	For the wisdom of doctrine is according to her name, and she is not manifest unto many, but with them to whom she is known, she continueth even to the sight of God.
<br>24	Give ear, my son, and take wise counsel, and cast not away my advice.
<br>25	Put thy feet into her fetters, and thy neck into her chains:
<br>26	Bow down thy shoulder, and bear her, and be not grieved with her bands.
<br>27	Come to her with all thy mind, and keep her ways with all thy power.
<br>28	Search for her, and she shall be made known to thee, and when thou hast gotten her, let her not go:
<br>29	For in the latter end thou shalt find rest in her, and she shall be turned to thy joy.
<br>30	Then shall her fetters be a strong defence for thee, and a firm foundation, and her chain a robe of glory:
<br>31	For in her is the beauty of life, and her bands are a healthful binding.
<br>32	Thou shalt put her on as a robe of glory, and thou shalt set her upon thee as a crown of joy.
<br>33	My son, if thou wilt attend to me, thou shalt learn: and if thou wilt apply thy mind, thou shalt be wise.
<br>34	If thou wilt incline thy ear, thou shalt re- ceive instruction: and if thou love to hear, thou shalt be wise.
<br>35	Stand in the multitude of ancients that are wise, and join thyself from thy heart to their wisdom, that thou mayst hear every discourse of
<br> 
<br>God, and the sayings of praise may not escape thee.
<br>36	And if thou see a man of understanding, go to him early in the morning, and let thy foot wear the steps of his doors.
<br>37	Let thy thoughts be upon the precepts of God, and meditate continually on his command- ments: and he will give thee a heart, and the desire of wisdom shall be given to thee.
<br>
<br>Chapter 7
<br>
<br>Do no evils, and no evils shall lay hold of thee.
<br>2	Depart from the unjust, and evils shall de- part from thee.
<br>3	My son, sow not evils in the furrows of in- justice, and thou shalt not reap them sevenfold. 4 Seek not of the Lord a preeminence, nor of
<br>the king the seat of honour.
<br>5	Justify not thyself before God, for he knoweth the heart: and desire not to appear wise before the king.
<br>6	Seek not to be made a judge, unless thou have strength enough to extirpate iniquities: lest thou fear the person of the powerful, and lay a stumblingblock for thy integrity.
<br>7	Offend not against the multitude of a city, neither cast thyself in upon the people,
<br>8	Nor bind sin to sin: for even in one thou shalt not be unpunished.
<br>9	Be not fainthearted in thy mind:
<br>10	Neglect not to pray, and to give alms.
<br>11	Say not: God will have respect to the mul- titude of my gifts, and when I offer to the most high God, he will accept my offerings.
<br>12	Laugh no man to scorn in the bitterness of his soul: for there is one that humbleth and exalteth, God who seeth all.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>13	Devise not a lie against thy brother: nei- ther do the like against thy friend.
<br>14	Be not willing to make any manner of lie: for the custom thereof is not good.
<br>15	Be not full of words in a multitude of an- cients, and repeat not the word in thy prayer.
<br>16	Hate not laborious works, nor husbandry ordained by the most High.
<br>17	Number not thyself among the multitude of the disorderly.
<br>18	Remember wrath, for it will not tarry long.
<br>19	Humble thy spirit very much: for the vengeance on the flesh of the ungodly is fire and worms.
<br>20	Do not transgress against thy friend defer- ring money, nor despise thy dear brother for the sake of gold.
<br>21	Depart not from a wise and good wife, whom thou hast gotten in the fear of the Lord: for the grace of her modesty is above gold.
<br>22	Hurt not the servant that worketh faith- fully, nor the hired man that giveth thee his life. 23 Let a wise servant be dear to thee as thy own soul, defraud him not of liberty, nor leave
<br>him needy.
<br>24	Hast thou cattle? have an eye to them: and if they be for thy profit, keep them with thee.
<br>25	Hast thou children? instruct them, and bow down their neck from their childhood.
<br>26	Hast thou daughters? have a care of their body, and shew not thy countenance gay towards them.
<br>27	Marry thy daughter well, and thou shalt do a great work, and give her to a wise man.
<br>28	If thou hast a wife according to thy soul, cast her not off: and to her that is hateful, trust not thyself. With thy whole heart,
<br>29	Honour thy father, and forget not the groanings of thy mother:
<br> 
<br>30	Remember that thou hadst not been born but through them: and make a return to them as they have done for thee.
<br>31	With all thy soul fear the Lord, and rever- ence his priests.
<br>32	With all thy strength love him that made thee: and forsake not his ministers.
<br>33	Honour God with all thy soul and give hon- our to the priests, and purify thyself with thy arms.
<br>34	Give them their portion, as it is com- manded thee, of the firstfruits and of purifica- tions: and for thy negligences purify thyself with a few.
<br>35	Offer to the Lord the gift of thy shoulders, and the sacrifice of sanctification, and the first- fruits of the holy things:
<br>36	And stretch out thy hand to the poor, that thy expiation and thy blessing may be perfected. 37 A gift hath grace in the sight of all the
<br>living, and restrain not grace from the dead.
<br>38	Be not wanting in comforting them that weep, and walk with them that mourn.
<br>39	Be not slow to visit the sick: for by these things thou shalt be confirmed in love.
<br>40	In all thy works remember thy last end, and thou shalt never sin.
<br>
<br>Chapter 8
<br>Strive not with a powerful man, lest thou fall into his hands.
<br>2	Contend not with a rich man, lest he bring an action against thee.
<br>3	For gold and silver hath destroyed many, and hath reached even to the heart of kings, and perverted them.
<br>4	Strive not with a man that is full of tongue, and heap not wood upon his fire.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>5	Communicate not with an ignorant man, lest he speak ill of thy family.
<br>6	Despise not a man that turneth away from sin, nor reproach him therewith: remember that we are all worthy of reproof.
<br>7	Despise not a man in his old age; for we also shall become old.
<br>8	Rejoice not at the death of thy enemy; know- ing that we all die, and are not willing that others should rejoice at our death.
<br>9	Despise not the discourse of them that are ancient and wise, but acquaint thyself with their proverbs.
<br>10	For of them thou shalt learn wisdom, and instruction of understanding, and to serve great men without blame.
<br>11	Let not the discourse of the ancients escape thee, for they have learned of their fathers:
<br>12	For of them thou shalt learn understand- ing, and to give an answer in time of need.
<br>13	Kindle not the coals of sinners by rebuking them, lest thou be burnt with the flame of the fire of their sins.
<br>14	Stand not against the face of an injurious person, lest he sit as a spy to entrap thee in thy words.
<br>15	Lend not to a man that is mightier than thyself: and if thou lendest, count it as lost.
<br>16	Be not surety above thy power: and if thou be surety, think as if thou wert to pay it.
<br>17	Judge not against a judge: for he judgeth according to that which is just.
<br>18	Go not on the way with a bold man, lest he burden thee with his evils: for he goeth ac- cording to his own will, and thou shalt perish together with his folly.
<br>19	Quarrel not with a passionate man, and go not into the desert with a bold man: for blood is as nothing in his sight, and where there is no help he will overthrow thee.
<br> 
<br>20	Advise not with fools, for they cannot love but such things as please them.
<br>21	Before a stranger do no matter of counsel: for thou knowest not what he will bring forth.
<br>22	Open not thy heart to every man: lest he repay thee with an evil turn, and speak reproach- fully to thee.
<br>
<br>Chapter 9
<br>Be not jealous over the wife of thy bosom, lest she shew in thy regard the malice of a wicked lesson.
<br>2	Give not the power of thy soul to a woman, lest she enter upon thy strength, and thou be confounded.
<br>3	Look not upon a woman that hath a mind for many: lest thou fall into her snares.
<br>4	Use not much the company of her that is a dancer, and hearken not to her, lest thou perish by the force of her charms.
<br>5	Gaze not upon a maiden, lest her beauty be a stumblingblock to thee.
<br>6	Give not thy soul to harlots in any point: lest thou destroy thyself and thy inheritance.
<br>7	Look not round about thee in the ways of the city, nor wander up and down in the streets thereof.
<br>8	Turn away thy face from a woman dressed up, and gaze not about upon another’s beauty.
<br>9	For many have perished by the beauty of a woman, and hereby lust is enkindled as a fire.
<br>10	Every woman that is a harlot, shall be trod- den upon as dung in the way.
<br>11	Many by admiring the beauty of another man’s wife, have become reprobate, for her con- versation burneth as fire.
<br>12	Sit not at all with another man’s wife, nor repose upon the bed with her:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>13	And strive not with her over wine, lest thy heart decline towards her and by thy blood thou fall into destruction.
<br>14	Forsake not an old friend, for the new will not be like to him.
<br>15	A new friend is as new wine: it shall grow old, and thou shalt drink it with pleasure.
<br>16	Envy not the glory and riches of a sinner: for thou knowest not what his ruin shall be.
<br>17	Be not pleased with the wrong done by the unjust, knowing that even to hell the wicked shall not please.
<br>18	Keep thee far from the man that hath power to kill, so thou shalt not suspect the fear of death.
<br>19	And if thou come to him, commit no fault, lest he take away thy life.
<br>20	Know it to be a communication with death: for thou art going in the midst of snares, and walking upon the arms of them that are grieved.
<br>21	According to thy power beware of thy neighbour, and treat with the wise and prudent. 22 Let just men be thy guests, and let thy
<br>glory be in the fear of God.
<br>23	And let the thought of God be in thy mind, and all thy discourse on the commandments of the Highest.
<br>24	Works shall be praised for the hand of the artificers, and the prince of the people for the wisdom of his speech, but the word of the an- cients for the sense.
<br>25	A man full of tongue is terrible in his city, and he that is rash in his word shall be hateful.
<br>
<br>Chapter 10
<br>
<br>A wise judge shall judge his people, and the gov- ernment of a prudent man shall be steady.
<br> 
<br>2	As the judge of the people is himself, so also are his ministers: and what manner of man the ruler of a city is, such also are they that dwell therein.
<br>3	An unwise king shall be the ruin of his peo- ple: and cities shall be inhabited through the prudence of the rulers.
<br>4	The power of the earth is in the hand of God, and in his time he will raise up a profitable ruler over it.
<br>5	The prosperity of man is in the hand of God, and upon the person of the scribe he shall lay his honour.
<br>6	Remember not any injury done thee by thy neighbour, and do thou nothing by deeds of in- jury.
<br>7	Pride is hateful before God and men: and all iniquity of nations is execrable.
<br>8	A kingdom is translated from one people to another, because of injustices, and wrongs, and injuries, and divers deceits.
<br>9	But nothing is more wicked than the cov- etous man. Why is earth, and ashes proud?
<br>10	There is not a more wicked thing than to love money: for such a one setteth even his own soul to sale: because while he liveth he hath cast away his bowels.
<br>11	All power is of short life. A long sickness is troublesome to the physician.
<br>12	The physician cutteth off a short sickness: so also a king is to day, and to morrow he shall die.
<br>13	For when a man shall die, he shall inherit serpents, and beasts, and worms.
<br>14	The beginning of the pride of man, is to fall off from God:
<br>15	Because his heart is departed from him that made him: for pride is the beginning of all sin: he that holdeth it, shall be filled with maledictions, and it shall ruin him in the end.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>16	Therefore hath the Lord disgraced the as- semblies of the wicked, and hath utterly de- stroyed them.
<br>17	God hath overturned the thrones of proud princes, and hath set up the meek in their stead. 18 God hath made the roots of proud nations to wither, and hath planted the humble of these
<br>nations.
<br>19	The Lord hath overthrown the lands of the Gentiles, and hath destroyed them even to the foundation.
<br>20	He hath made some of them to wither away, and hath destroyed them, and hath made the memory of them to cease from the earth.
<br>21	God hath abolished the memory of the proud, and hath preserved the memory of them that are humble in mind.
<br>22	Pride was not made for men: nor wrath for the race of women.
<br>23	That seed of men shall be honoured, which feareth God: but that seed shall be dishonoured, which transgresseth the commandments of the Lord.
<br>24	In the midst of brethren their chief is hon- ourable: so shall they that fear the Lord, be in his eyes.
<br>25	The fear of God is the glory of the rich, and of the honourable, and of the poor.
<br>26	Despise not a just man that is poor, and do not magnify a sinful man that is rich.
<br>27	The great man, and the judge, and the mighty is in honour: and there is none greater than he that feareth God.
<br>28	They that are free shall serve a servant that is wise: and a man that is prudent and well instructed will not murmur when he is reproved; and he that is ignorant, shall not be honoured.
<br>29	Extol not thyself in doing thy work, and linger not in the time of distress;
<br> 
<br>30	Better is he that laboureth, and aboundeth in all things, than he that boasteth himself and wanteth bread.
<br>31	My son, keep thy soul in meekness, and give it honour according to its desert.
<br>32	Who will justify him that sinneth against his own soul? and who will honour him that dishonoureth his own soul?
<br>33	The poor man is glorified by his discipline and fear, and there is a man that is honoured for his wealth.
<br>34	But he that is glorified in poverty, how much more in wealth? and he that is glorified in wealth, let him fear poverty.
<br>
<br>Chapter 11
<br>
<br>The wisdom of the humble shall exalt his head, and shall make him sit in the midst of great men. 2 Praise not a man for his beauty, neither de-
<br>spise a man for his look.
<br>3	The bee is small among flying things but her fruit hath the chiefest sweetness.
<br>4	Glory not in apparel at any time, and be not exalted in the day of thy honour: for the works of the Highest only are wonderful, and his works are glorious, and secret, and hidden.
<br>5	Many tyrants have sat on the throne, and he whom no man would think on, hath worn the crown.
<br>6	Many mighty men have been greatly brought down, and the glorious have been delivered into the hand of others.
<br>7	Before thou inquire, blame no man: and when thou hast inquired, reprove justly.
<br>8	Before thou hear, answer not a word: and interrupt not others in the midst of their dis- course.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>9	Strive not in a matter which doth not con- cern thee, and sit not in judgment with sinners. 10 My son, meddle not with many matters: and if thou be rich, thou shalt not be free from sin: for if thou pursue after thou shalt not over- take; and if thou run before thou shalt not es-
<br>cape.
<br>11	There is an ungodly man that laboureth, and maketh haste, and is in sorrow, and is so much the more in want.
<br>12	Again, there is an inactive man that wan- teth help, is very weak in ability, and full of poverty:
<br>13	Yet the eye of God hath looked upon him for good, and hath lifted him up from his low estate, and hath exalted his head: and many have wondered at him, and have glorified God.
<br>14	Good things and evil, life and death, poverty and riches, are from God.
<br>15	Wisdom and discipline, and the knowledge of the law are with God. Love and the ways of good things are with him.
<br>16	Error and darkness are created with sin- ners: and they that glory in evil things, grow old in evil.
<br>17	The gift of God abideth with the just, and his advancement shall have success for ever.
<br>18	There is one that is enriched by living spar- ingly, and this is the portion of his reward.
<br>19	In that he saith: I have found me rest, and now I will eat of my goods alone:
<br>20	And he knoweth not what time shall pass, and that death approacheth, and that he must leave all to others, and shall die.
<br>21	Be steadfast in thy covenant, and be con- versant therein, and grow old in the work of thy commandments.
<br>22	Abide not in the works of sinners. But trust in God, and stay in thy place,
<br> 
<br>23	For it is easy in the eyes of God on a sudden to make the poor man rich.
<br>24	The blessing of God maketh haste to re- ward the just, and in a swift hour his blessing beareth fruit.
<br>25	Say not: What need I, and what good shall I have by this?
<br>26	Say not: I am sufficient for myself: and what shall I be made worse by this?
<br>27	In the day of good things be not unmindful of evils: and in the day of evils be not unmindful of good things:
<br>28	For it is easy before God in the day of death to reward every one according to his ways.
<br>29	The affliction of an hour maketh one forget great delights, and in the end of a man is the disclosing of his works.
<br>30	Praise not any man before death, for a man is known by his children.
<br>31	Bring not every man into thy house: for many are the snares of the deceitful.
<br>32	For as corrupted bowels send forth stinking breath, and as the partridge is brought into the cage, and as the roe into the snare: so also is the heart of the proud, and as a spy that looketh on the fall of his neighbour.
<br>33	For he lieth in wait and turneth good into evil, and on the elect he will lay a blot.
<br>34	Of one spark cometh a great fire, and of one deceitful man much blood: and a sinful man lieth in wait for blood.
<br>35	Take heed to thyself of a mischievous man, for he worketh evils: lest he bring upon thee reproach for ever.
<br>36	Receive a stranger in, and he shall over- throw thee with a whirlwind, and shall turn thee out of thy own.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 12
<br>If thou do good, know to whom thou dost it, and there shall be much thanks for thy good deeds.
<br>2	Do good to the just, and thou shalt find great recompense: and if not of him, assuredly of the Lord.
<br>3	For there is no good for him that is always occupied in evil, and that giveth no alms: for the Highest hateth sinners, and hath mercy on the penitent.
<br>4	Give to the merciful and uphold not the sin- ner: God will repay vengeance to the ungodly and to sinners, and keep them against the day of vengeance.
<br>5	Give to the good, and receive not a sinner.
<br>6	Do good to the humble, and give not to the ungodly: hold back thy bread, and give it not to him, lest thereby he overmaster thee.
<br>7	For thou shalt receive twice as much evil for all the good thou shalt have done to him: for the Highest also hateth sinners, and will repay vengeance to the ungodly.
<br>8	A friend shall not be known in prosperity, and an enemy shall not be hidden in adversity.
<br>9	In the prosperity of a man, his enemies are grieved: and a friend is known in his adversity.
<br>10	Never trust thy enemy for as a brass pot his wickedness rusteth:
<br>11	Though he humble himself and go crouch- ing, yet take good heed and beware of him.
<br>12	Set him not by thee, neither let him sit on thy right hand, lest he turn into thy place, and seek to take thy seat and at the last thou acknowledge my words, and be pricked with my sayings.
<br>13	Who will pity an enchanter struck by a serpent, or any that come near wild beasts? so is it with him that keepeth company with a wicked man, and is involved in his sins.
<br> 
<br>14	For an hour he will abide with thee: but if thou begin to decline, he will not endure it.
<br>15	An enemy speaketh sweetly with his lips, but in his heart he lieth in wait, to throw thee into a pit.
<br>16	An enemy weepeth with his eyes: but if he find an opportunity he will not be satisfied with blood:
<br>17	And if evils come upon thee, thou shalt find him there first.
<br>18	An enemy hath tears in his eyes, and while he pretendeth to help thee, will undermine thy feet.
<br>19	He will shake his head, and clap his hands, and whisper much, and change his countenance.
<br>
<br>Chapter 13
<br>He that toucheth pitch, shall be defiled with it: and he that hath fellowship with the proud, shall put on pride.
<br>2	He shall take a burden upon him that hath fellowship with one more honourable than him- self. And have no fellowship with one that is richer than thyself.
<br>3	What agreement shall the earthen pot have with the kettle? for if they knock one against the other, it shall be broken.
<br>4	The rich man hath done wrong, and yet he will fume: but the poor is wronged and must hold his peace.
<br>5	If thou give, he will make use of thee: and if thou have nothing, he will forsake thee.
<br>6	If thou have any thing, he will live with thee, and will make thee bare, and he will not be sorry for thee.
<br>7	If he have need of thee he will deceive thee, and smiling upon thee will put thee in hope; he will speak thee fair, and will say: What wantest
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>thou?
<br>8	And he will shame thee by his meats, till he have drawn thee dry twice or thrice, and at last he will laugh at thee: and afterward when he seeth thee, he will forsake thee, and shake his head at thee.
<br>9	Humble thyself to God, and wait for his hands.
<br>10	Beware that thou be not deceived into folly, and be humbled.
<br>11	Be not lowly in thy wisdom, lest being humbled thou be deceived into folly.
<br>12	If thou be invited by one that is mightier, withdraw thyself: for so he will invite thee the more.
<br>13	Be not troublesome to him, lest thou be put back: and keep not far from him, lest thou be forgotten.
<br>14	Affect not to speak with him as an equal, and believe not his many words: for by much talk he will sift thee, and smiling will examine thee concerning thy secrets.
<br>15	His cruel mind will lay up thy words: and he will not spare to do thee hurt, and to cast thee into prison.
<br>16	Take heed to thyself, and attend diligently to what thou hearest: for thou walkest in danger of thy ruin.
<br>17	When thou hearest those things, see as it were in sleep, and thou shalt awake.
<br>18	Love God all thy life, and call upon him for thy salvation.
<br>19	Every beast loveth its like: so also every man him that is nearest to himself.
<br>20	All flesh shall consort with the like to itself, and every man shall associate himself to his like. 21 If the wolf shall at any time have fellowship
