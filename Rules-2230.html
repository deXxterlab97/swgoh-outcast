<br>Findings regarding Foreign Investment Risk Review
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 115–232, div. A, title XVII, §1702(a), Aug. 13, 2018, 132 Stat. 2174, provided that: "Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>"(1) According to a February 2016 report by the International Trade Administration of the Department of Commerce, 12,000,000 United States workers, equivalent to 8.5 percent of the labor force, have jobs resulting from foreign investment, including 3,500,000 jobs in the manufacturing sector alone.
<br>
<br>"(2) In 2016, new foreign direct investment in United States manufacturing totaled $129,400,000,000.
<br>
<br>"(3) The Bureau of Economic Analysis of the Department of Commerce concluded that, in 2015—
<br>
<br>"(A) foreign-owned affiliates in the United States—
<br>
<br>"(i) contributed $894,500,000,000 in value added to the United States economy;
<br>
<br>"(ii) exported goods valued at $352,800,000,000, accounting for nearly a quarter of total exports of goods from the United States; and
<br>
<br>"(iii) undertook $56,700,000,000 in research and development; and
<br>
<br>"(B) the 7 countries investing the most in the United States, all of which are United States allies (the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, France, Canada, Switzerland, and the Netherlands) accounted for 72.1 percent of the value added by foreign-owned affiliates in the United States and more than 80 percent of research and development expenditures by such entities.
<br>
<br>"(4) According to the Government Accountability Office, from 2011 to 2016, the number of transactions reviewed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (commonly referred to as 'CFIUS') grew by 55 percent, while the staff of the Committees assigned to the reviews increased by 11 percent.
<br>
<br>"(5) According to a February 2018 report of the Government Accountability Office on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (GAO–18–249): 'Officials from Treasury and other member agencies are aware of pressures on their CFIUS staff given the current workload and have expressed concerns about possible workload increases.'. The Government Accountability Office concluded: 'Without attaining an understanding of the staffing levels needed to address the current and future CFIUS workload, particularly if legislative changes to CFIUS's authorities further expand its workload, CFIUS may be limited in its ability to fulfill its objectives and address threats to the national security of the United States.'.
<br>
<br>"(6) On March 30, 1954, Dwight David Eisenhower—five-star general, Supreme Allied Commander, and 34th President of the United States—in his 'Special Message to the Congress on Foreign Economic Policy', counseled: 'Great mutual advantages to buyer and seller, to producer and consumer, to investor and to the community where investment is made, accrue from high levels of trade and investment.'. President Eisenhower continued: 'The internal strength of the American economy has evolved from such a system of mutual advantage. In the press of other problems and in the haste to meet emergencies, this nation—and many other nations of the free world—have all too often lost sight of this central fact.'. President Eisenhower concluded: 'If we fail in our trade policy, we may fail in all. Our domestic employment, our standard of living, our security, and the solidarity of the free world—all are involved.'."

<br>"SEC. 1242. FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY.
<br>
<br>"(a) Findings.—Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>"(1) A fair business environment is necessary to advance international trade, economic stability, and development worldwide, is beneficial for American workers and businesses, and is in the United States national interest.
<br>
<br>"(2) In some cases, mandated offset requirements can cause economic distortions in international defense trade and undermine fairness and competitiveness, and may cause particular harm to small- and medium-sized businesses.
<br>
<br>"(3) The use of offsets may lead to increasing dependence on foreign suppliers for the production of United States weapons systems.
<br>
<br>"(4) The offset demands required by some purchasing countries, including some close allies of the United States, equal or exceed the value of the base contract they are intended to offset, mitigating much of the potential economic benefit of the exports.
<br>
<br>"(5) Offset demands often unduly distort the prices of defense contracts.
<br>
<br>"(6) In some cases, United States contractors are required to provide indirect offsets which can negatively impact nondefense industrial sectors.
<br>
<br>"(7) Unilateral efforts by the United States to prohibit offsets may be impractical in the current era of globalization and would severely hinder the competitiveness of the United States defense industry in the global market.
<br>
<br>"(8) The development of global standards to manage and restrict demands for offsets would enhance United States efforts to mitigate the negative impact of offsets.
<br>
<br>"(b) Declaration of Policy.—It is the policy of the United States to monitor the use of offsets in international defense trade, to promote fairness in such trade, and to ensure that foreign participation in the production of United States weapons systems does not harm the economy of the United States.
