<br>(A) to meeting the objective of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act [33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.] to restore and maintain the physical, chemical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters, and
<br>
<br>(B) to attaining the goals established by subsection (a).
<br>
<br>The project under this subsection shall be carried out to improve the quality of effluent discharged from publicly owned treatment works operated by the city of Fayetteville, Arkansas, into Mud Creek or its tributaries.
<br>(c) Non-Federal responsibilities
<br>
<br>For the project conducted under subsection (b), the non-Federal interest shall agree—
<br>
<br>(1) to provide, without cost to the United States, all lands, easements, rights-of-way, relocations, and dredged material disposal areas necessary for construction and subsequent research and demonstration work;
<br>

Federal and State land-owning agencies and private parties may contribute to such areas.
<br>(3) Factors to consider
<br>
<br>In establishing the demonstration program under this subsection, the Secretary shall consider—

<br>(1)(A) any new or substantially improved structure (other than a structure necessary for conducting a water-dependent activity) built in the 100-year flood plain with a first floor elevation less than the 100-year flood elevation after July 1, 1991; or
<br>
<br>(B) in the case of a county substantially located within the 100-year flood plain, any new or substantially improved structure (other than a structure necessary for conducting a water-dependent activity) built in the 10-year flood plain after July 1, 1991; and
<br>
<br>(2) any structure which becomes located in the 100-year flood plain with a first floor elevation less than the 100-year flood elevation or in the 10-year flood plain, as the case may be, by virtue of constrictions placed in the flood plain after July 1, 1991.
<br>(b) Flood damage reduction benefits
<br>(1) In general
