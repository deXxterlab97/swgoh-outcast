<br>a certain girl, having a pythonical spirit, met us, who brought to her masters much gain by divining.
<br>17	This same following Paul and us, cried out, saying: These men are the servants of the most high God, who preach unto you the way of sal- vation.
<br>18	And this she did many days. But Paul being grieved, turned, and said to the spirit: I command thee, in the name of Jesus Christ, to go out from her. And he went out the same hour.
<br>19	But her masters,   seeing that the hope of their gain was gone, apprehending Paul and Silas, brought them into the marketplace to the rulers.
<br>20	And presenting them to the magistrates, they said: These men disturb our city, being Jews;
<br>21	And preach a fashion which it is not lawful for us to receive nor observe, being Romans.
<br>22	And the people ran together against them; and the magistrates rending off their clothes, commanded them to be beaten with rods.
<br>23	And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the gaoler to keep them diligently.
<br> 
<br>24	Who having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.
<br>25	And at midnight, Paul and Silas praying, praised God. And they that were in prison, heard them.
<br>26	And suddenly there was a great earth- quake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken. And immediately all the doors were opened, and the bands of all were loosed.
<br>27	And the keeper of the prison, awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the doors of the prison open, drawing his sword, would have killed him- self, supposing that the prisoners had been fled. 28 But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying:
<br>Do thyself no harm, for we all are here.
<br>29 Then calling for a light, he went in, and trembling, fell down at the feet of Paul and Silas. 30 And bringing them out, he said: Masters,
<br>what must I do, that I may be saved?
<br>31	But they said: Believe in the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.
<br>32	And they preached the word of the Lord to him and to all that were in his house.
<br>33	And he, taking them the same hour of the night, washed their stripes, and himself was bap- tized, and all his house immediately.
<br>34	And when he had brought them into his own house, he laid the table for them, and re- joiced with all his house, believing God.
<br>35	And when the day was come, the magis- trates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go.
<br>36	And the keeper of the prison told these words to Paul: The magistrates have sent to let you go; now therefore depart, and go in peace.
<br>37	But Paul said to them: They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men that are Ro- mans, and have cast us into prison: and now
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>do they thrust us out privately? Not so; but let them come,
<br>38	And let us out themselves. And the ser- jeants told these words to the magistrates. And they were afraid, hearing that they were Ro- mans.
<br>39	And coming, they besought them; and bringing them out, they desired them to depart out of the city.
<br>40	And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of Lydia; and having seen the brethren, they comforted them, and de- parted.
<br>
<br>Chapter 17
<br>And when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.
<br>2	And Paul, according to his custom, went in unto them; and for three sabbath days he rea- soned with them out of the scriptures:
<br>3	Declaring and insinuating that the Christ was to suffer, and to rise again from the dead; and that this is Jesus Christ, whom I preach to you.
<br>4	And some of them believed, and were associ- ated to Paul and Silas; and of those that served God, and of the Gentiles a great multitude, and of noble women not a few.
<br>5	But the Jews, moved with envy, and tak- ing unto them some wicked men of the vulgar sort, and making a tumult, set the city in an uproar; and besetting Jason’s house, sought to bring them out unto the people.
<br>6	And not finding them, they drew Jason and certain brethren to the rulers of the city, crying: They that set the city in an uproar, are come hither also;
<br> 
<br>7	Whom Jason hath received; and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus.
<br>8	And they stirred up the people, and the rulers of the city hearing these things,
<br>9	And having taken satisfaction of Jason and of the rest, they let them go.
<br>10	But the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea. Who, when they were come thither, went into the synagogue of the Jews.
<br>11	Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, who received the word with all ea- gerness, daily searching the scriptures, whether these things were so.
<br>12	And many indeed of them believed, and of honourable women that were Gentiles, and of men not a few.
<br>13	And when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was also preached by Paul at Berea, they came thither also, stirring up and troubling the multitude.
<br>14	And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul, to go unto the sea; but Silas and Timothy remained there.
<br>15	And they that conducted Paul, brought him as far as Athens; and receiving a command- ment from him to Silas and Timothy, that they should come to him with all speed, they de- parted.
<br>16	Now whilst Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred within him, seeing the city wholly given to idolatry.
<br>17	He disputed, therefore, in the synagogue with the Jews, and with them that served God, and in the marketplace, every day with them that were there.
<br>18	And certain philosophers of the Epicureans and of the Stoics disputed with him; and some said: What is it, that this word sower would say?
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>But others: He seemeth to be a setter forth of new gods; because he preached to them Jesus and the resurrection.
<br>19	And taking him, they brought him to the Areopagus, saying: May we know what this new doctrine is, which thou speakest of?
<br>20	For thou bringest in certain new things to our ears. We would know therefore what these things mean.
<br>21	(Now all the Athenians, and strangers that were there, employed themselves in nothing else, but either in telling or in hearing some new thing.)
<br>22	But Paul standing in the midst of the Are- opagus, said: Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are too superstitious.
<br>23	For passing by, and seeing your idols, I found an altar also, on which was written: To the unknown God. What therefore you worship, without knowing it, that I preach to you:
<br>24	God, who made the world, and all things therein; he, being Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;
<br>25	Neither is he served with men’s hands, as though he needed any thing; seeing it is he who giveth to all life, and breath, and all things:
<br>26	And hath made of one, all mankind, to dwell upon the whole face of the earth, deter- mining appointed times, and the limits of their habitation.
<br>27	That they should seek God, if happily they may feel after him or find him, although he be not far from every one of us:
<br>28	For in him we live, and move, and are; as some also of your own poets said: For we are also his offspring.
<br>29	Being therefore the offspring of God, we must not suppose the divinity to be like unto gold, or silver, or stone, the graving of art, and device of man.
<br> 
<br>30	And God indeed having winked at the times of this ignorance, now declareth unto men, that all should every where do penance.
<br>31	Because he hath appointed a day wherein he will judge the world in equity, by the man whom he hath appointed; giving faith to all, by raising him up from the dead.
<br>32	And when they had heard of the resurrec- tion of the dead, some indeed mocked, but oth- ers said: We will hear thee again concerning this matter.
<br>33	So Paul went out from among them.
<br>34	But certain men adhering to him, did be- lieve; among whom was also Dionysius, the Are- opagite, and a woman named Damaris, and oth- ers with them.
<br>
<br>Chapter 18
<br>After these things, departing from Athens, he came to Corinth.
<br>2	And finding a certain Jew, named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with Priscilla his wife, (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome,) he came to them.
<br>3	And because he was of the same trade, he remained with them, and wrought; (now they were tentmakers by trade.)
<br>4	And he reasoned in the synagogue every sab- bath, bringing in the name of the Lord Jesus; and he persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.
<br>5	And when Silas and Timothy were come from Macedonia, Paul was earnest in preaching, testifying to the Jews, that Jesus is the Christ.
<br>6	But they gainsaying and blaspheming, he shook his garments, and said to them: Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>7	And departing thence, he entered into the house of a certain man, named Titus Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house was adjoin- ing to the synagogue.
<br>8	And Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, be- lieved in the Lord, with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing, believed, and were baptized.
<br>9	And the Lord said to Paul in the nights, by a vision: Do not fear, but speak; and hold not thy peace,
<br>10	Because I am with thee: and no man shall set upon thee, to hurt thee; for I have much peo- ple in this city.
<br>11	And he stayed there a year and six months, teaching among them the word of God.
<br>12	But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,
<br>13	Saying: This man persuadeth men to wor- ship God contrary to the law.
<br>14	And when Paul was beginning to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews: If it were some matter of injustice, or an heinous deed, O Jews, I should with reason bear with you.
<br>15	But if they be questions of word and names, and of your law, look you to it: I will not be judge of such things.
<br>16	And he drove them from the judgment seat. 17 And all laying hold on Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, beat him before the judgment
<br>seat; and Gallio cared for none of those things.
<br>18	But Paul, when he had stayed yet many days, taking his leave of the brethren, sailed thence into Syria (and with him Priscilla and Aquila), having shorn his head in Cenchrae: for he had a vow.
<br>19	And he came to Ephesus, and left them there. But he himself entering into the syna- gogue, disputed with the Jews.
<br> 
<br>20	And when they desired him, that he would tarry a longer time, he consented not;
<br>21	But taking his leave, and saying: I will return to you again, God willing, he departed from Ephesus.
<br>22	And going down to Caesarea, he went up to Jerusalem, and saluted the church, and so came down to Antioch.
<br>23	And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went through the country of Galatia and Phrygia, in order, confirming all the disciples.
<br>24	Now a certain Jew, named Apollo, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus, one mighty in the scriptures.
<br>25	This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, spoke, and taught diligently the things that are of Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John.
<br>26	This man therefore began to speak boldly in the synagogue. Whom when Priscilla and Aquila had heard, they took him to them, and expounded to him the way of the Lord more dili- gently.
<br>27	And whereas he was desirous to go to Achaia, the brethren exhorting, wrote to the dis- ciples to receive him. Who, when he was come, helped them much who had believed.
<br>28	For with much vigour he convinced the Jews openly, shewing by the scriptures, that Je- sus is the Christ.
<br>
<br>Chapter 19
<br>And it came to pass, while Apollo was at Corinth, that Paul having passed through the upper coasts, came to Ephesus, and found cer- tain disciples.
<br>2 And he said to them: Have you received the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Holy Ghost since ye believed? But they said to him: We have not so much as heard whether there be a Holy Ghost.
<br>3	And he said: In what then were you bap- tized? Who said: In John’s baptism.
<br>4	Then Paul said: John baptized the people with the baptism of penance, saying: That they should believe in him who was to come after him, that is to say, in Jesus.
<br>5	Having heard these things, they were bap- tized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
<br>6	And when Paul had imposed his hands on them, the Holy Ghost came upon them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.
<br>7	And all the men were about twelve.
<br>8	And entering into the synagogue, he spoke boldly for the space of three months, disputing and exhorting concerning the kingdom of God.
<br>9	But when some were hardened, and believed not, speaking evil of the way of the Lord, be- fore the multitude, departing from them, he sep- arated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.
<br>10	And this continued for the space of two years, so that all they who dwelt in Asia, heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Gentiles.
<br>11	And God wrought by the hand of Paul more than common miracles.
<br>12	So that even there were brought from his body to the sick, handkerchiefs and aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the wicked spirits went out of them.
<br>13	Now some also of the Jewish exorcists who went about, attempted to invoke over them that had evil spirits, the name of the Lord Jesus, say- ing: I conjure you by Jesus, whom Paul prea- cheth.
<br>14	And there were certain men, seven sons of Sceva, a Jew, a chief priest, that did this.
<br> 
<br>15	But the wicked spirit, answering, said to them: Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?
<br>16	And the man in whom the wicked spirit was, leaping upon them, and mastering them both, prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.
<br>17	And this became known to all the Jews and the Gentiles that dwelt at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.
<br>18	And many of them that believed, came con- fessing and declaring their deeds.
<br>19	And many of them who had followed curi- ous arts, brought together their books, and burnt them before all; and counting the price of them, they found the money to be fifty thousand pieces of silver.
<br>20	So mightily grew the word of God, and was confirmed.
<br>21	And when these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying: After I have been there, I must see Rome also.
<br>22	And sending into Macedonia two of them that ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself remained for a time in Asia.
<br>23	Now at that time there arose no small dis- turbance about the way of the Lord.
<br>24	For a certain man named Demetrius, a sil- versmith, who made silver temples for Diana, brought no small gain to the craftsmen;
<br>25	Whom he calling together, with the work- men of like occupation, said: Sirs, you know that our gain is by this trade;
<br>26	And you see and hear, that this Paul by persuasion hath drawn away a great multitude, not only of Ephesus, but almost of all Asia, say- ing: They are not gods which are made by hands.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>27	So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought, but also the temple of great Diana shall be reputed for nothing; yea, and her majesty shall begin to be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.
<br>28	Having heard these things, they were full of anger, and cried out, saying: Great is Diana of the Ephesians.
<br>29	And the whole city was filled with confu- sion; and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul’s companions, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.
<br>30	And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.
<br>31	And some also of the rulers of Asia, who were his friends, sent unto him, desiring that he would not venture himself into the theatre.
<br>32	Now some cried one thing, some another. For the assembly was confused, and the greater part knew not for what cause they were come together.
<br>33	And they drew forth Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews thrusting him forward. And Alexander beckoning with his hand for silence, would have given the people satisfaction.
<br>34	But as soon as they perceived him to be a Jew, all with one voice, for the space of about two hours, cried out: Great is Diana of the Eph- esians.
<br>35	And when the town clerk had appeased the multitudes, he said: Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great Diana, and of Jupiter’s offspring.
<br>36	For as much therefore as these things can- not be contradicted, you ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.
<br>37	For you have brought hither these men, who are neither guilty of sacrilege, nor of blas- phemy against your goddess.
<br> 
<br>38	But if Demetrius and the craftsmen that are with him, have a matter against any man, the courts of justice are open, and there are pro- consuls: let them accuse one another.
<br>39	And if you inquire after any other matter, it may be decided in a lawful assembly.
<br>40	For we are even in danger to be called in question for this day’s uproar, there being no man guilty (of whom we may give account) of this concourse. And when he had said these things, he dismissed the assembly.
<br>
<br>Chapter 20
<br>And after the tumult was ceased, Paul calling to him the disciples, and exhorting them, took his leave, and set forward to go into Macedonia.
<br>2	And when he had gone over those parts, and had exhorted them with many words, he came into Greece;
<br>3	Where, when he had spent three months, the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria; so he took a resolution to return through Macedonia.
<br>4	And there accompanied him Sopater the son of Pyrrhus, of Berea; and of the Thessalo- nians, Aristarchus, and Secundus, and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.
<br>5	These going before, stayed for us at Troas.
<br>6	But we sailed from Philippi after the days of the Azymes, and came to them to Troas in five days, where we abode seven days.
<br>7	And on the first day of the week, when we were assembled to break bread, Paul discoursed with them, being to depart on the morrow: and he continued his speech until midnight.
<br>8	And there were a great number of lamps in the upper chamber where we were assembled.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>9	And a certain young man named Eutychus, sitting on the window, being oppressed with a deep sleep, (as Paul was long preaching,) by oc- casion of his sleep fell from the third loft down, and was taken up dead.
<br>10	To whom, when Paul had gone down, he laid himself upon him, and embracing him, said: Be not troubled, for his soul is in him.
<br>11	Then going up, and breaking bread and tasting, and having talked a long time to them, until daylight, so he departed.
<br>12	And they brought the youth alive, and were not a little comforted.
<br>13	But we, going aboard the ship, sailed to Assos, being there to take in Paul; for so he had appointed, himself purposing to travel by land.
<br>14	And when he had met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene.
<br>15	And sailing thence, the day following we came over against Chios; and the next day we arrived at Samos; and the day following we came to Miletus.
<br>16	For Paul had determined to sail by Eph- esus, lest he should be stayed any time in Asia. For he hasted, if it were possible for him, to keep the day of Pentecost at Jerusalem.
<br>17	And sending from Miletus to Ephesus, he called the ancients of the church.
<br>18	And when they were come to him, and were together, he said to them: You know from the first day that I came into Asia, in what manner I have been with you, for all the time,
<br>19	Serving the Lord with all humility, and with tears, and temptations which befell me by the conspiracies of the Jews;
<br>20	How I have kept back nothing that was profitable to you, but have preached it to you, and taught you publicly, and from house to house,
<br>21	Testifying   both   to   Jews   and   Gentiles
<br> 
<br>penance towards God, and faith in our Lord Je- sus Christ.
<br>22	And now, behold, being bound in the spirit, I go to Jerusalem: not knowing the things which shall befall me there:
<br>23	Save that the Holy Ghost in every city wit- nesseth to me, saying: That bands and afflictions wait for me at Jerusalem.
<br>24	But I fear none of these things, neither do I count my life more precious than myself, so that I may consummate my course and the ministry of the word which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.
<br>25	And now behold, I know that all you, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.
<br>26	Wherefore I take you to witness this day, that I am clear from the blood of all men;
<br>27	For I have not spared to declare unto you all the counsel of God.
<br>28	Take heed to yourselves, and to the whole flock, wherein the Holy Ghost hath placed you bishops, to rule the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.
<br>29	I know that, after my departure, ravening wolves will enter in among you, not sparing the flock.
<br>30	And of your own selves shall arise men speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.
<br>31	Therefore watch, keeping in memory, that for three years I ceased not, with tears to ad- monish every one of you night and day.
<br>32	And now I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, who is able to build up, and to give an inheritance among all the sanctified.
<br>33	I have not coveted any man’s silver, gold, or apparel, as
<br>34	You yourselves know: for such things as were needful for me and them that are with me,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>these hands have furnished.
<br>35	I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring you ought to support the weak, and to remember the word of the Lord Jesus, how he said: It is a more blessed thing to give, rather than to receive.
<br>36	And when he had said these things, kneel- ing down, he prayed with them all.
<br>37	And there was much weeping among them all; and falling on the neck of Paul, they kissed him,
<br>38	Being grieved most of all for the word which he had said, that they should see his face no more. And they brought him on his way to the ship.
<br>
<br>Chapter 21
<br>And when it came to pass that, being parted from them, we set sail, we came with a straight course to Coos, and the day following to Rhodes, and from thence to Patara.
<br>2	And when we had found a ship sailing over to Phenice, we went aboard, and set forth.
<br>3	And when we had discovered Cyprus, leav- ing it on the left hand, we sailed into Syria, and came to Tyre: for there the ship was to unlade her burden.
<br>4	And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem.
<br>5	And the days being expired, departing we went forward, they all bringing us on our way, with their wives and children, till we were out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and we prayed.
<br>6	And when we had bid one another farewell, we took ship; and they returned home.
<br>7	But we having finished the voyage by sea,
<br> 
<br>from Tyre came down to Ptolemais: and saluting the brethren, we abode one day with them.
<br>8	And the next day departing, we came to Caesarea. And entering into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, we abode with him.
<br>9	And he had four daughters, virgins, who did prophesy.
<br>10	And as we tarried there for some days, there came from Judea a certain prophet, named Agabus.
<br>11	Who, when he was come to us, took Paul’s girdle: and binding his own feet and hands, he said: Thus saith the Holy Ghost: The man whose girdle this is, the Jews shall bind in this manner in Jerusalem, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.
<br>12	Which when we had heard, both we and they that were of that place, desired him that he would not go up to Jerusalem.
<br>13	Then Paul answered, and said: What do you mean weeping and afflicting my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but to die also in Jerusalem, for the name of the Lord Jesus.
<br>14	And when we could not persuade him, we ceased, saying: The will of the Lord be done.
<br>15	And after those days, being prepared, we went up to Jerusalem.
<br>16	And there went also with us some of the disciples from Caesarea, bringing with them one Mnason a Cyprian, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge.
<br>17	And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.
<br>18	And the day following, Paul went in with us unto James; and all the ancients were assembled. 19 Whom when he had saluted, he related par- ticularly what things God had wrought among
<br>the Gentiles by his ministry.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>20	But they hearing it, glorified God, and said to him: Thou seest, brother, how many thou- sands there are among the Jews that have be- lieved: and they are all zealous for the law.
<br>21	Now they have heard of thee that thou teachest those Jews, who are among the Gen- tiles, to depart from Moses: saying, that they ought not to circumcise their children, nor walk according to the custom.
<br>22	What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come.
<br>23	Do therefore this that we say to thee. We have four men, who have a vow on them.
<br>24	Take these, and sanctify thyself with them: and bestow on them, that they may shave their heads: and all will know that the things which they have heard of thee, are false; but that thou thyself also walkest keeping the law.
<br>25	But as touching the Gentiles that believe, we have written, decreeing that they should only refrain themselves from that which has been of- fered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangles, and from fornication.
<br>26	Then Paul took the men, and the next day being purified with them, entered into the tem- ple, giving notice of the accomplishment of the days of purification, until an oblation should be offered for every one of them.
<br>27	But when the seven days were drawing to an end, those Jews that were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands upon him, crying out:
<br>28	Men of Israel, help: This is the man that teacheth all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place; and moreover hath brought in Gentiles into the temple, and hath violated this holy place.
<br>29	(For they had seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him, whom they supposed that
<br> 
<br>Paul had brought into the temple.)
<br>30	And the whole city was in an uproar: and the people ran together. And taking Paul, they drew him out of the temple, and immediately the doors were shut.
<br>31	And as they went about to kill him, it was told the tribune of the band, That all Jerusalem was in confusion.
<br>32	Who, forthwith taking with him soldiers and centurions, ran down to them. And when they saw the tribune and the soldiers they left off beating Paul.
<br>33	Then the tribune coming near, took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains: and demanded who he was, and what he had done.
<br>34	And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude. And when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he com- manded him to be carried into the castle.
<br>35	And when he was come to the stairs, it fell out that he was carried by the soldiers, because of the violence of the people.
<br>36	For the multitude of the people followed after, crying: Away with him.
<br>37	And as Paul was about to be brought into the castle, he saith to the tribune: May speak something to thee? Who said: Canst thou speak Greek?
<br>38	Art not thou that Egyptian who before these days didst raise a tumult, and didst lead forth into the desert four thousand men that were murderers?
<br>39	But Paul said to him: I am a Jew of Tar- sus in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city. And I beseech thee, suffer me to speak to the people.
<br>40	And when he had given him leave, Paul standing on the stairs, beckoned with his hand to the people. And a great silence being made, he spoke unto them in the Hebrew tongue, saying:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 22
<br>Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye the account which I now give unto you.
<br>2	(And when they heard that he spoke to them in the Hebrew tongue, they kept the more si- lence.)
<br>3	And he saith: I am a Jew, born at Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought up in this city, at the feet of Gamaliel, taught according to the truth of the law of the fathers, zealous for the law, as also all you are this day:
<br>4	Who persecuted this way unto death, bind- ing and delivering into prisons both men and women.
<br>5	As the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the ancients: from whom also receiv- ing letters to the brethren, I went to Damascus, that I might bring them bound from thence to Jerusalem to be punished.
<br>6	And it came to pass, as I was going, and drawing nigh to Damascus at midday, that sud- denly from heaven there shone round about me a great light:
<br>7	And falling on the ground, I heard a voice saying to me: Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
<br>8	And I answered: Who art thou, Lord? And he said to me: I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.
<br>9	And they that were with me, saw indeed the light, but they heard not the voice of him that spoke with me.
<br>10	And I said: What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me: Arise, and go to Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things that thou must do.
<br>11	And whereas I did not see for the bright- ness of that light, being led by the hand by my companions, I came to Damascus.
<br> 
<br>12	And one Ananias, a man according to the law, having testimony of all the Jews who dwelt there,
<br>13	Coming to me, and standing by me, said to me: Brother Saul, look up. And I the same hour looked upon him.
<br>14	But he said: The God of our fathers hath preordained thee that thou shouldst know his will, and see the Just One, and shouldst hear the voice from his mouth.
<br>15	For thou shalt be his witness to all men, of those things which thou hast seen and heard.
<br>16	And now why tarriest thou? Rise up, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, invoking his name.
<br>17	And it came to pass, when I was come again to Jerusalem, and was praying in the temple, that I was in a trance,
<br>18	And saw him saying unto me: Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem; because they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.
<br>19	And I said: Lord, they know that I cast into prison, and beat in every synagogue, them that believed in thee.
<br>20	And when the blood of Stephen thy witness was shed, I stood by and consented, and kept the garments of them that killed him.
<br>21	And he said to me: Go, for unto the Gen- tiles afar off, will I send thee.
<br>22	And they heard him until this word, and then lifted up their voice, saying: Away with such an one from the earth; for it is not fit that he should live.
<br>23	And as they cried out and threw off their garments, and cast dust into the air,
<br>24	The tribune commanded him to be brought into the castle, and that he should be scourged and tortured: to know for what cause they did so cry out against him.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>25	And when they had bound him with thongs, Paul saith to the centurion that stood by him: Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?
<br>26	Which the centurion hearing, went to the tribune, and told him, saying: What art thou about to do? For this man is a Roman citizen.
<br>27	And the tribune coming, said to him: Tell me, art thou a Roman? But he said: Yea.
<br>28	And the tribune answered: I obtained the being free of this city with a great sum. And Paul said: But I was born so.
<br>29	Immediately therefore they departed from him that were about to torture him. The tribune also was afraid after he understood that he was a Roman citizen, and because he had bound him. 30 But on the next day, meaning to know more diligently for what cause he was accused by the Jews, he loosed him, and commanded the priests to come together, and all the council: and bring-
<br>ing forth Paul, he set him before them.
<br>
<br>Chapter 23
<br>And Paul looking upon the council, said: Men, brethren, I have conversed with all good con- science before God until this present day.
<br>2	And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to strike him on the mouth.
<br>3	Then Paul said to him: God shall strike thee, thou whited wall. For sittest thou to judge me according to the law, and contrary to the law commandest me to be struck?
<br>4	And they that stood by said: Dost thou revile the high priest of God?
<br>5	And Paul said: I knew not, brethren, that he is the high priest. For it is written: Thou shalt not speak evil of the prince of thy people.
<br> 
<br>6	And Paul knowing that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, cried out in the council: Men, brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of Pharisees: concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.
<br>7	And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sad- ducees; and the multitude was divided.
<br>8	For the Sadducees say that there is no resur- rection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Phar- isees confess both.
<br>9	And there arose a great cry. And some of the Pharisees rising up, strove, saying: We find no evil in this man. What if a spirit hath spoken to him, or an angel?
<br>10	And when there arose a great dissension, the tribune fearing lest Paul should be pulled in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring him into the castle.
<br>11	And the night following the Lord stand- ing by him, said: Be constant; for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.
<br>12	And when day was come, some of the Jews gathered together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying, that they would neither eat, nor drink, till they killed Paul.
<br>13	And they were more than forty men that had made this conspiracy.
<br>14	Who came to the chief priests and the an- cients, and said: We have bound ourselves under a great curse that we will eat nothing till we have slain Paul.
<br>15	Now therefore do you with the council sig- nify to the tribune, that he bring him forth to you, as if you meant to know something more certain touching him. And we, before he come near, are ready to kill him.
<br>16	Which when Paul’s sister’s son had heard,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>of their lying in wait, he came and entered into the castle and told Paul.
<br>17	And Paul, calling to him one of the centu- rions, said: Bring this young man to the tribune, for he hath some thing to tell him.
<br>18	And he taking him, brought him to the tribune, and said: Paul, the prisoner, desired me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath some thing to say to thee.
<br>19	And the tribune taking him by the hand, went aside with him privately, and asked him: What is it that thou hast to tell me?
<br>20	And he said: The Jews have agreed to de- sire thee, that thou wouldst bring forth Paul to morrow into the council, as if they meant to in- quire some thing more certain touching him.
<br>21	But do not thou give credit to them; for there lie in wait for him more than forty men of them, who have bound themselves by oath nei- ther to eat, nor to drink, till they have killed him: and they are now ready, looking for a promise from thee.
<br>22	The tribune therefore dismissed the young man, charging him that he should tell no man, that he had made known these things unto him. 23 Then having called two centurions, he said to them: Make ready two hundred soldiers to go as far as Caesarea, and seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen for the third hour of the
<br>night:
<br>24	And provide beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring him safe to Felix the governor.
<br>25	(For he feared lest perhaps the Jews might take him away by force and kill him, and he should afterwards be slandered, as if he was to take money.) And he wrote a letter after this manner:
<br>26	Claudius Lysias to the most excellent gov- ernor, Felix, greeting.
<br>27	This man being taken by the Jews, and
<br> 
<br>ready to be killed by them, I rescued coming in with an army, understanding that he is a Roman: 28 And meaning to know the cause which they objected unto him, I brought him forth into their
<br>council.
<br>29	Whom I found to be accused concerning questions of their law; but having nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bands.
<br>30	And when I was told of ambushes that they had prepared for him, I sent him to thee, signi- fying also to his accusers to plead before thee. Farewell.
<br>31	Then the soldiers, according as it was com- manded them, taking Paul, brought him by night to Antipatris.
<br>32	And the next day, leaving the horsemen to go with him, they returned to the castle.
<br>33	Who, when they were come to Caesarea, and had delivered the letter to the governor, did also present Paul before him.
<br>34	And when he had read it, and had asked of what province he was, and understood that he was of Cilicia;
<br>35	I will hear thee, said he, when thy accusers come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod’s judgment hall.
<br>
<br>Chapter 24
<br>And after five days the high priest Ananias came down, with some of the ancients, and one Tertul- lus an orator, who went to the governor against Paul.
<br>2	And Paul being called for, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying: Whereas through thee we live in much peace, and many things are rectified by thy providence,
<br>3	We accept it always and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thanksgiving.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>4	But that I be no further tedious to thee, I desire thee of thy clemency to hear us in few words.
<br>5	We have found this to be a pestilent man, and raising seditions among all the Jews throughout the world, and author of the sedi- tion of the sect of the Nazarenes.
<br>6	Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom, we having apprehended, would also have judged according to our law.
<br>7	But Lysias the tribune coming upon us, with great violence took him away out of our hands; 8 Commanding his accusers to come to thee: of whom thou mayest thyself, by examination, have knowledge of all these things, whereof we
<br>accuse him.
<br>9	And the Jews also added, and said that these things were so.
<br>10	Then Paul answered, (the governor making a sign to him to speak:) Knowing that for many years thou hast been judge over this nation, I will with good courage answer for myself.
<br>11	For thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days, since I went up to adore in Jerusalem:
<br>12	And neither in the temple did they find me disputing with any man, or causing any con- course of the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:
<br>13	Neither can they prove unto thee the things whereof they now accuse me.
<br>14	But this I confess to thee, that according to the way, which they call a heresy, so do I serve the Father and my God, believing all things which are written in the law and the prophets:
<br>15	Having hope in God, which these also themselves look for, that there shall be a res- urrection of the just and unjust.
<br>16	And herein do I endeavour to have always a conscience without offence toward God, and
<br> 
<br>towards men.
<br>17	Now after many years, I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings, and vows.
<br>18	In which I was found purified in the temple: neither with multitude, nor with tumult.
<br>19	But certain Jews of Asia, who ought to be present before thee, and to accuse, if they had any thing against me:
<br>20	Or let these men themselves say, if they found in me any iniquity, when standing before the council,
<br>21	Except it be for this one voice only that I cried, standing among them, Concerning the resurrection of the dead am I judged this day by you.
<br>22	And Felix put them off, having most cer- tain knowledge of this way, saying: When Lysias the tribune shall come down, I will hear you.
<br>23	And he commanded a centurion to keep him, and that he should be easy, and that he should not prohibit any of his friends to minister unto him.
<br>24	And after some days, Felix, coming with Drusilla his wife, who was a Jew, sent for Paul, and heard of him the faith, that is in Christ Je- sus.
<br>25	And as he treated of justice, and chastity, and of the judgment to come, Felix being terri- fied, answered: For this time, go thy way: but when I have a convenient time, I will send for thee.
<br>26	Hoping also withal, that money should be given him by Paul; for which cause also often- times sending for him, he spoke with him.
<br>27	But when two years were ended, Felix had for successor Portius Festus. And Felix being willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 25
<br>Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days, he went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.
<br>2	And the chief priests, and principal men of the Jews, went unto him against Paul: and they besought him,
<br>3	Requesting favour against him, that he would command him to be brought to Jerusalem, laying wait to kill him in the way.
<br>4	But Festus answered: That Paul was kept in Caesarea, and that he himself would very shortly depart thither.
<br>5	Let them, therefore, saith he, among you that are able, go down with me, and accuse him, if there be any crime in the man.
<br>6	And having tarried among them no more than eight or ten days, he went down to Cae- sarea, and the next day he sat in the judgment seat; and commanded Paul to be brought.
<br>7	Who being brought, the Jews stood about him, who were come down from Jerusalem, ob- jecting many and grievous causes, which they could not prove;
<br>8	Paul making answer for himself: Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the tem- ple, nor against Caesar, have I offended in any thing.
<br>9	But Festus, willing to shew the Jews a plea- sure, answering Paul, said: Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?
<br>10	Then Paul said: I stand at Caesar’s judg- ment seat, where I ought to be judged. To the Jews I have done no injury, as thou very well knowest.
<br>11	For if I have injured them, or have commit- ted any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die. But if there be none of these things whereof they
<br> 
<br>accuse me, no man may deliver me to them: I appeal to Caesar.
<br>12	Then Festus having conferred with the council, answered: Hast thou appealed to Cae- sar? To Caesar shalt thou go.
<br>13	And after some days, king Agrippa and Bernice came down to Caesarea to salute Festus. 14 And as they tarried there many days, Fes- tus told the king of Paul, saying: A certain man
<br>was left prisoner by Felix.
<br>15	About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests, and the ancients of the Jews, came unto me, desiring condemnation against him.
<br>16	To whom I answered: It is not the custom of the Romans to condemn any man, before that he who is accused have his accusers present, and have liberty to make his answer, to clear himself of the things laid to his charge.
<br>17	When therefore they were come hither, without any delay, on the day following, sitting in the judgment seat, I commanded the man to be brought.
<br>18	Against whom, when the accusers stood up, they brought no accusation of things which I thought ill of:
<br>19	But had certain questions of their own superstition against him, and of one Jesus de- ceased, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.
<br>20	I therefore being in a doubt of this manner of question, asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things. 21 But Paul appealing to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be
<br>kept, till I might send him to Caesar.
<br>22	And Agrippa said to Festus: I would also hear the man, myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.
<br>23	And on the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice were come with great pomp, and had entered into the hall of audience, with the tri-
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>bunes, and principal men of the city, at Festus’ commandment, Paul was brought forth.
<br>24	And Festus saith: King Agrippa, and all ye men who are here present with us, you see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews dealt with me at Jerusalem, requesting and crying out that he ought not to live any longer. 25 Yet have I found nothing that he hath com- mitted worthy of death. But forasmuch as he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have de-
<br>termined to send him.
<br>26	Of whom I have nothing certain to write to my lord. For which cause I have brought him forth before you, and especially before thee, O king Agrippa, that examination being made, I may have what to write.
<br>27	For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not to signify the things laid to his charge.
<br>
<br>Chapter 26
<br>Then Agrippa said to Paul: Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretching forth his hand, began to make his answer.
<br>2	I think myself happy, O king Agrippa, that I am to answer for myself this day before thee, touching all the things whereof I am accused by the Jews.
<br>3	Especially as thou knowest all, both customs and questions that are among the Jews: Where- fore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.
<br>4	And my life indeed from my youth, which was from the beginning among my own nation in Jerusalem, all the Jews do know:
<br>5	Having known me from the beginning (if they will give testimony) that according to the most sure sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee. 6 And now for the hope of the promise that
<br> 
<br>was made by God to the fathers, do I stand sub- ject to judgment:
<br>7	Unto which, our twelve tribes, serving night and day, hope to come. For which hope, O king, I am accused by the Jews.
<br>8	Why should it be thought a thing incredible, that God should raise the dead?
<br>9	And I indeed did formerly think, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
<br>10	Which also I did at Jerusalem, and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority of the chief priests: and when they were put to death, I brought the sentence.
<br>11	And oftentimes punishing them, in every synagogue, I compelled them to blaspheme: and being yet more mad against them, I persecuted them even unto foreign cities.
<br>12	Whereupon when I was going to Damascus with authority and permission of the chief priest, 13 At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me, and them that were in
<br>company with me.
<br>14 And when we were all fallen down on the ground, I heard a voice speaking to me in the He- brew tongue: Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? It is hard for thee to kick against the goad. 15 And I said: Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord answered: I am Jesus whom thou perse-
<br>cutest.
<br>16	But rise up, and stand upon thy feet: for to this end have I appeared to thee, that I may make thee a minister, and a witness of those things which thou hast seen, and of those things wherein I will appear to thee,
<br>17	Delivering thee from the people, and from the nations, unto which now I send thee:
<br>18	To open their eyes, that they may be converted from darkness to light, and from the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and a lot among the saints, by the faith that is in me.
<br>19	Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not in- credulous to the heavenly vision:
<br>20	But to them first that are at Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and unto all the country of Judea, and to the Gentiles did I preach, that they should do penance, and turn to God, doing works worthy of penance.
<br>21	For this cause the Jews, when I was in the temple, having apprehended me, went about to kill me.
<br>22	But being aided by the help of God, I stand unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying no other thing than those which the prophets, and Moses did say should come to pass:
<br>23	That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light to the people, and to the Gentiles.
<br>24	As he spoke these things, and made his answer, Festus said with a loud voice: Paul, thou art beside thyself: much learning doth make thee mad.
<br>25	And Paul said: I am not mad, most ex- cellent Festus, but I speak words of truth and soberness.
<br>26	For the king knoweth of these things, to whom also I speak with confidence. For I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him. For neither was any of these things done in a corner.
<br>27	Believest thou the prophets, O king Agrippa? I know that thou believest.
<br>28	And Agrippa said to Paul: In a little thou persuadest me to become a Christian.
<br>29	And Paul said: I would to God, that both in a little and in much, not only thou, but also
<br> 
<br>all that hear me, this day, should become such as I also am, except these bands.
<br>30	And the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them.
<br>31	And when they were gone aside, they spoke among themselves, saying: This man hath done nothing worthy of death or of bands.
<br>32	And Agrippa said to Festus: This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not ap- pealed to Caesar.
<br>
<br>Chapter 27
<br>And when it was determined that he should sail into Italy, and that Paul, with the other prison- ers, should be delivered to a centurion, named Julius, of the band Augusta,
<br>2	Going on board a ship of Adrumetum, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia, Aristarchus, the Macedonian of Thessalonica, continuing with us.
<br>3	And the day following we came to Sidon. And Julius treating Paul courteously, permitted him to go to his friends, and to take care of him- self.
<br>4	And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.
<br>5	And sailing over the sea of Cilicia, and Pam- phylia, we came to Lystra, which is in Lycia:
<br>6	And there the centurion finding a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy, removed us into it.
<br>7	And when for many days we had sailed slowly, and were scarce come over against Gnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed near Crete by Salmone:
<br>8	And with much ado sailing by it, we came into a certain place, which is called Good-havens, nigh to which was the city of Thalassa.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>9	And when much time was spent, and when sailing now was dangerous, because the fast was now past, Paul comforted them,
<br>10	Saying to them: Ye men, I see that the voyage beginneth to be with injury and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.
<br>11	But the centurion believed the pilot and the master of the ship, more than those things which were said by Paul.
<br>12	And whereas it was not a commodious haven to winter in, the greatest part gave coun- sel to sail thence, if by any means they might reach Phenice to winter there, which is a haven of Crete, looking towards the southwest and north- west.
<br>13	And the south wind gently blowing, think- ing that they had obtained their purpose, when they had loosed from Asson, they sailed close by Crete.
<br>14	But not long after, there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroaquilo.
<br>15	And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up against the wind, giving up the ship to the winds, we were driven.
<br>16	And running under a certain island, that is called Cauda, we had much work to come by the boat.
<br>17	Which being taken up, they used helps, un- dergirding the ship, and fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, they let down the sail yard, and so were driven.
<br>18	And we being mightily tossed with the tem- pest, the next day they lightened the ship.
<br>19	And the third day they cast out with their own hands the tackling of the ship.
<br>20	And when neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small storm lay on us, all hope of our being saved was now taken away.
<br>21	And after they had fasted a long time, Paul
<br> 
<br>standing forth in the midst of them, said: You should indeed, O ye men, have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and have gained this harm and loss.
<br>22	And now I exhort you to be of good cheer. For there shall be no loss of any man’s life among you, but only of the ship.
<br>23	For an angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve, stood by me this night,
<br>24	Saying: Fear not, Paul, thou must be brought before Caesar; and behold, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.
<br>25	Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer; for I be- lieve God that it shall so be, as it hath been told me.
<br>26	And we must come unto a certain island.
<br>27	But after the fourteenth night was come, as we were sailing in Adria, about midnight, the shipmen deemed that they discovered some country.
<br>28	Who also sounding, found twenty fathoms; and going on a little further, they found fifteen fathoms.
<br>29	Then fearing lest we should fall upon rough places, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.
<br>30	But as the shipmen sought to fly out of the ship, having let down the boat into the sea, under colour, as though they would have cast anchors out of the forepart of the ship,
<br>31	Paul said to the centurion, and to the sol- diers: Except these stay in the ship, you cannot be saved.
<br>32	Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.
<br>33	And when it began to be light, Paul be- sought them all to take meat, saying: This day is the fourteenth day that you have waited, and continued fasting, taking nothing.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>34	Wherefore I pray you to take some meat for your health’s sake; for there shall not an hair of the head of any of you perish.
<br>35	And when he had said these things, taking bread, he gave thanks to God in the sight of them all; and when he had broken it, he began to eat.
<br>36	Then were they all of better cheer, and they also took some meat.
<br>37	And we were in all in the ship, two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.
<br>38	And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, casting the wheat into the sea.
<br>39	And when it was day, they knew not the land; but they discovered a certain creek that had a shore, into which they minded, if they could, to thrust in the ship.
<br>40	And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves to the sea, loosing withal the rudder bands; and hoisting up the mainsail to the wind, they made towards shore.
<br>41	And when we were fallen into a place where two seas met, they run the ship aground; and the forepart indeed, sticking fast, remained unmove- able: but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the sea.
<br>42	And the soldiers’ counsel was, that they should kill the prisoners, lest any of them, swim- ming out, should escape.
<br>43	But the centurion, willing to save Paul, for- bade it to be done; and he commanded that they who could swim, should cast themselves first into the sea, and save themselves, and get to land.
<br>44	And the rest, some they carried on boards, and some on those things that belonged to the ship. And so it came to pass, that every soul got safe to land.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 28
<br>
<br>And when we had escaped, then we knew that the island was called Melita. But the barbarians shewed us no small courtesy.
<br>2	For kindling a fire, they refreshed us all, be- cause of the present rain, and of the cold.
<br>3	And when Paul had gathered together a bundle of sticks, and had laid them on the fire, a viper coming out of the heat, fastened on his hand.
<br>4	And when the barbarians saw the beast hanging on his hand, they said one to an- other: Undoubtedly this man is a murderer, who though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance doth not suffer him to live.
<br>5	And he indeed shaking off the beast into the fire, suffered no harm.
<br>6	But they supposed that he would begin to swell up, and that he would suddenly fall down and die. But expecting long, and seeing that there came no harm to him, changing their minds, they said, that he was a god.
<br>7	Now in these places were possessions of the chief man of the island, named Publius, who re- ceiving us, for three days entertained us courte- ously.
<br>8	And it happened that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever, and of a bloody flux. To whom Paul entered in; and when he had prayed, and laid his hands on him, he healed him.
<br>9	Which being done, all that had diseases in the island, came and were healed:
<br>10	Who also honoured us with many honours, and when we were to set sail, they laded us with such things as were necessary.
<br>11	And after three months, we sailed in a ship of Alexandria, that had wintered in the island, whose sign was the Castors.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>12	And when we were come to Syracusa, we tarried there three days.
<br>13	From thence, compassing by the shore, we came to Rhegium: and after one day, the south wind blowing, we came the second day to Pute- oli;
<br>14	Where, finding brethren, we were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went to Rome.
<br>15	And from thence, when the brethren had heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii Forum, and the Three Taverns: whom when Paul saw, he gave thanks to God, and took courage.
<br>16	And when we were come to Rome, Paul was suffered to dwell by himself, with a soldier that kept him.
<br>17	And after the third day, he called together the chief of the Jews. And when they were as- sembled, he said to them: Men, brethren, I, hav- ing done nothing against the people, or the cus- tom of our fathers, was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans;
<br>18	Who, when they had examined me, would have released me, for that there was no cause of death in me;
<br>19	But the Jews contradicting it, I was con- strained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had any thing to accuse my nation of.
<br>20	For this cause therefore I desired to see you, and to speak to you. Because that for the hope of Israel, I am bound with this chain.
<br>21	But they said to him: We neither received letters concerning thee from Judea, neither did any of the brethren that came hither, relate or speak any evil of thee.
<br>22	But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest; for as concerning this sect, we know that it is every where contradicted.
<br>23	And when they had appointed him a day,
<br> 
<br>there came very many to him unto his lodgings; to whom he expounded, testifying the kingdom of God, and persuading them concerning Jesus, out of the law of Moses and the prophets, from morning until evening.
<br>24	And some believed the things that were said; but some believed not.
<br>25	And when they agreed not among them- selves, they departed, Paul speaking this one word: Well did the Holy Ghost speak to our fa- thers by Isaias the prophet,
<br>26	Saying: Go to this people, and say to them: With the ear you shall hear, and shall not un- derstand; and seeing you shall see, and shall not perceive.
<br>27	For the heart of this people is grown gross, and with their ears have they heard heavily, and their eyes they have shut; lest perhaps they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.
<br>28	Be it known therefore to you, that this sal- vation of God is sent to the Gentiles, and they will hear it.
<br>29	And when he had said these things, the Jews went out from him, having much reasoning among themselves.
<br>30	And he remained two whole years in his own hired lodging; and he received all that came in to him,
<br>31	Preaching the kingdom of God, and teach- ing the things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, without prohibition.

<br>The Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Romans
<br>
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,
<br>2	Which he had promised before, by his prophets, in the holy scriptures,
<br>3	Concerning his Son, who was made to him of the seed of David, according to the flesh,
<br>4	Who was predestinated the Son of God in power, according to the spirit of sanctification, by the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ from the dead;
<br>5	By whom we have received grace and apos- tleship for obedience to the faith, in all nations, for his name;
<br>6	Among whom are you also the called of Jesus Christ:
<br>7	To all that are at Rome, the beloved of God, called to be saints. Grace to you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. 8 First I give thanks to my God, through Jesus Christ, for you all, because your faith is spoken
<br>of in the whole world.
<br>9	For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceas- ing I make a commemoration of you;
<br>10	Always in my prayers making request, if by any means now at length I may have a pros- perous journey, by the will of God, to come unto you.
<br> 
<br>11	For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual grace, to strengthen you: 12 That is to say, that I may be comforted together in you, by that which is common to us
<br>both, your faith and mine.
<br>13	And I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that I have often purposed to come unto you, (and have been hindered hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.
<br>14	To the Greeks and to the barbarians, to the wise and to the unwise, I am a debtor;
<br>15	So (as much as is in me) I am ready to preach the gospel to you also that are at Rome. 16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel. For
<br>it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth, to the Jew first, and to the Greek.
<br>17	For the justice of God is revealed therein, from faith unto faith, as it is written: The just man liveth by faith.
<br>18	For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and injustice of those men that detain the truth of God in injus- tice:
<br>19	Because that which is known of God is manifest in them. For God hath manifested it unto them.
<br>20	For the invisible things of him,  from the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>creation of the world, are clearly seen, being un- derstood by the things that are made; his eternal power also, and divinity: so that they are inex- cusable.
<br>21	Because that, when they knew God, they have not glorified him as God, or given thanks; but became vain in their thoughts, and their fool- ish heart was darkened.
<br>22	For professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.
<br>23	And they changed the glory of the incor- ruptible God into the likeness of the image of a corruptible man, and of birds, and of fourfooted beasts, and of creeping things.
<br>24	Wherefore God gave them up to the desires of their heart, unto uncleanness, to dishonour their own bodies among themselves.
<br>25	Who changed the truth of God into a lie; and worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.
<br>26	For this cause God delivered them up to shameful affections. For their women have changed the natural use into that use which is against nature.
<br>27	And, in like manner, the men also, leav- ing the natural use of the women, have burned in their lusts one towards another, men with men working that which is filthy, and receiving in themselves the recompense which was due to their error.
<br>28	And as they liked not to have God in their knowledge, God delivered them up to a repro- bate sense, to do those things which are not con- venient;
<br>29	Being filled with all iniquity, malice, forni- cation, avarice, wickedness, full of envy, murder, contention, deceit, malignity, whisperers,
<br>30	Detractors, hateful to God, contumelious, proud, haughty, inventors of evil things, disobe- dient to parents,
<br> 
<br>31	Foolish, dissolute, without affection, with- out fidelity, without mercy.
<br>32	Who, having known the justice of God, did not understand that they who do such things, are worthy of death; and not only they that do them, but they also that consent to them that do them.
<br>
<br>Chapter 2
<br>Wherefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whoso- ever thou art that judgest. For wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself. For thou dost the same things which thou judgest.
<br>2	For we know that the judgment of God is, according to truth, against them that do such things.
<br>3	And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them who do such things, and dost the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?
<br>4	Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and patience, and longsuffering? Knowest thou not, that the benignity of God leadeth thee to penance?
<br>5	But according to thy hardness and impeni- tent heart, thou treasurest up to thyself wrath, against the day of wrath, and revelation of the just judgment of God.
<br>6	Who will render to every man according to his works.
<br>7	To them indeed, who according to patience in good work, seek glory and honour and incor- ruption, eternal life:
<br>8	But to them that are contentious, and who obey not the truth, but give credit to iniquity, wrath and indignation.
<br>9	Tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that worketh evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Greek.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>10	But glory, and honour, and peace to every one that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.
<br>11	For there is no respect of persons with God. 12 For whosoever have sinned without the law, shall perish without the law; and whosoever have
<br>sinned in the law, shall be judged by the law.
<br>13	For not the hearers of the law are just be- fore God, but the doers of the law shall be jus- tified.
<br>14	For when the Gentiles, who have not the law, do by nature those things that are of the law; these having not the law are a law to them- selves:
<br>15	Who shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness to them, and their thoughts between themselves ac- cusing, or also defending one another,
<br>16	In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to my gospel. 17 But if thou art called a Jew and restest in
<br>the law, and makest thy boast of God,
<br>18	And knowest his will, and approvest the more profitable things, being instructed by the law,
<br>19	Art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them that are in darkness, 20 An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of in- fants, having the form of knowledge and of truth
<br>in the law.
<br>21	Thou therefore that teachest another, teachest not thyself: thou that preachest that men should not steal, stealest:
<br>22	Thou that sayest, men should not commit adultery, committest adultery: thou that abhor- rest idols, committest sacrilege:
<br>23	Thou that makest thy boast of the law, by transgression of the law dishonourest God.
<br>24	(For the name of God through you is blas- phemed among the Gentiles, as it is written.)
<br> 
<br>25	Circumcision profiteth indeed, if thou keep the law; but if thou be a transgressor of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.
<br>26	If, then, the uncircumcised keep the jus- tices of the law, shall not this uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?
<br>27	And shall not that which by nature is un- circumcision, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision art a transgressor of the law?
<br>28	For it is not he is a Jew, who is so out- wardly; nor is that circumcision which is out- wardly in the flesh:
<br>29	But he is a Jew, that is one inwardly; and the circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.
<br>
<br>Chapter 3
<br>What advantage then hath the Jew, or what is the profit of circumcision?
<br>2	Much every way. First indeed, because the words of God were committed to them.
<br>3	For what if some of them have not believed? shall their unbelief make the faith of God with- out effect? God forbid.
<br>4	But God is true; and every man a liar, as it is written, That thou mayest be justified in thy words, and mayest overcome when thou art judged.
<br>5	But if our injustice commend the justice of God, what shall we say? Is God unjust, who executeth wrath?
<br>6	(I speak according to man.) God forbid: otherwise how shall God judge this world?
<br>7	For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie, unto his glory, why am I also yet judged as a sinner?
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>8	And not rather (as we are slandered, and as some affirm that we say) let us do evil, that there may come good? whose damnation is just. 9 What then?    Do we excel them?    No, not so. For we have charged both Jews, and Greeks,
<br>that they are all under sin.
<br>10	As it is written: There is not any man just.
<br>11	There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.
<br>12	All have turned out of the way; they are become unprofitable together: there is none that doth good, there is not so much as one.
<br>13	Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have dealt deceitfully. The venom of asps is under their lips.
<br>14	Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitter- ness:
<br>15	Their feet swift to shed blood:
<br>16	Destruction and misery in their ways:
<br>17	And the way of peace they have not known: 18 There is no fear of God before their eyes. 19 Now we know, that what things soever the
<br>law speaketh, it speaketh to them that are in the law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may be made subject to God.
<br>20	Because by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before him. For by the law is the knowledge of sin.
<br>21	But now without the law the justice of God is made manifest, being witnessed by the law and the prophets.
<br>22	Even the justice of God, by faith of Jesus Christ, unto all and upon all them that believe in him: for there is no distinction:
<br>23	For all have sinned, and do need the glory of God.
<br>24	Being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption, that is in Christ Jesus,
<br>25	Whom God hath proposed to be a propiti- ation, through faith in his blood, to the shewing
<br> 
<br>of his justice, for the remission of former sins,
<br>26	Through the forbearance of God, for the shewing of his justice in this time; that he himself may be just, and the justifier of him, who is of the faith of Jesus Christ.
<br>27	Where is then thy boasting? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? No, but by the law of faith.
<br>28	For we account a man to be justified by faith, without the works of the law.
<br>29	Is he the God of the Jews only? Is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also.
<br>30	For it is one God, that justifieth circumci- sion by faith, and uncircumcision through faith. 31 Do we, then, destroy the law through faith?
<br>God forbid: but we establish the law.
<br>
<br>Chapter 4
<br>
<br>What shall we say then that Abraham hath found, who is our father according to the flesh.
<br>2	For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory, but not before God.
<br>3	For what saith the scripture? Abraham be- lieved God, and it was reputed to him unto jus- tice.
<br>4	Now to him that worketh, the reward is not reckoned according to grace, but according to debt.
<br>5	But to him that worketh not, yet believeth in him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is reputed to justice, according to the purpose of the grace of God.
<br>6	As David also termeth the blessedness of a man, to whom God reputeth justice without works:
<br>7	Blessed are they whose iniquities are for- given, and whose sins are covered.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>8	Blessed is the man to whom the Lord hath not imputed sin.
<br>9	This blessedness then, doth it remain in the circumcision only, or in the uncircumcision also? For we say that unto Abraham faith was reputed to justice.
<br>10	How then was it reputed? When he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.
<br>11	And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the justice of the faith, which he had, being uncircumcised; that he might be the father of all them that believe, being uncircumcised, that unto them also it may be reputed to justice: 12 And might be the father of circumcision; not to them only, that are of the circumcision, but to them also that follow the steps of the faithful, that is in the uncircumcision of our fa-
<br>ther Abraham.
<br>13	For not through the law was the promise to Abraham, or to his seed, that he should be heir of the world; but through the justice of faith.
<br>14	For if they who are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, the promise is made of no effect.
<br>15	For the law worketh wrath. For where there is no law, neither is there transgression.
<br>16	Therefore is it of faith, that according to grace the promise might be firm to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,
<br>17	(As it is written: I have made thee a fa- ther of many nations,) before God, whom he believed, who quickeneth the dead; and calleth those things that are not, as those that are.
<br>18	Who against hope believed in hope; that he might be made the father of many nations, according to that which was said to him: So shall thy seed be.
<br>19	And he was not weak in faith; neither did
<br> 
<br>he consider his own body now dead, whereas he was almost an hundred years old, nor the dead womb of Sara.
<br>20	In the promise also of God he staggered not by distrust; but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God:
<br>21	Most fully knowing, that whatsoever he has promised, he is able also to perform.
<br>22	And therefore it was reputed to him unto justice.
<br>23	Now it is not written only for him, that it was reputed to him unto justice,
<br>24	But also for us, to whom it shall be reputed, if we believe in him, that raised up Jesus Christ, our Lord, from the dead,
<br>25	Who was delivered up for our sins, and rose again for our justification.
<br>
<br>Chapter 5
<br>Being justified therefore by faith, let us have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ: 2 By whom also we have access through faith into this grace, wherein we stand, and glory in
<br>the hope of the glory of the sons of God.
<br>3	And not only so; but we glory also in tribu- lations, knowing that tribulation worketh pa- tience;
<br>4	And patience trial; and trial hope;
<br>5	And hope confoundeth not: because the charity of God is poured forth in our hearts, by the Holy Ghost, who is given to us.
<br>6	For why did Christ, when as yet we were weak, according to the time, die for the ungodly? 7 For scarce for a just man will one die; yet perhaps for a good man some one would dare to
<br>die.
<br>8 But God commendeth his charity towards us; because when as yet we were sinners, accord-
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>ing to the time,
<br>9	Christ died for us; much more therefore, be- ing now justified by his blood, shall we be saved from wrath through him.
<br>10	For if, when we were enemies, we were rec- onciled to God by the death of his Son; much more, being reconciled, shall we be saved by his life.
<br>11	And not only so; but also we glory in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received reconciliation.
<br>12	Wherefore as by one man sin entered into this world, and by sin death; and so death passed upon all men, in whom all have sinned.
<br>13	For until the law sin was in the world; but sin was not imputed, when the law was not.
<br>14	But death reigned from Adam unto Moses, even over them also who have not sinned after the similitude of the transgression of Adam, who is a figure of him who was to come.
<br>15	But not as the offence, so also the gift. For if by the offence of one, many died; much more the grace of God, and the gift, by the grace of one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.
<br>16	And not as it was by one sin, so also is the gift. For judgment indeed was by one unto con- demnation; but grace is of many offences, unto justification.
<br>17	For if by one man’s offence death reigned through one; much more they who receive abun- dance of grace, and of the gift, and of justice, shall reign in life through one, Jesus Christ.
<br>18	Therefore, as by the offence of one, unto all men to condemnation; so also by the justice of one, unto all men to justification of life.
<br>19	For as by the disobedience of one man, many were made sinners; so also by the obedi- ence of one, many shall be made just.
<br>20	Now the law entered in, that sin might abound. And where sin abounded, grace did
<br> 
<br>more abound.
<br>21	That as sin hath reigned to death; so also grace might reign by justice unto life everlasting, through Jesus Christ our Lord.
<br>
<br>Chapter 6
<br>What shall we say, then? shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?
<br>2	God forbid. For we that are dead to sin, how shall we live any longer therein?
<br>3	Know you not that all we, who are baptized in Christ Jesus, are baptized in his death?
<br>4	For we are buried together with him by bap- tism into death; that as Christ is risen from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also may walk in newness of life.
<br>5	For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the like- ness of his resurrection.
<br>6	Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin may be destroyed, to the end that we may serve sin no longer.
<br>7	For he that is dead is justified from sin.
<br>8	Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall live also together with Christ:
<br>9	Knowing that Christ rising again from the dead, dieth now no more, death shall no more have dominion over him.
<br>10	For in that he died to sin, he died once; but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God:
<br>11	So do you also reckon, that you are dead to sin, but alive unto God, in Christ Jesus our Lord.
<br>12	Let no sin therefore reign in your mortal body, so as to obey the lusts thereof.
<br>13	Neither yield ye your members as instru- ments of iniquity unto sin; but present yourselves to God, as those that are alive from the dead,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>and your members as instruments of justice unto God.
<br>14	For sin shall not have dominion over you; for you are not under the law, but under grace. 15 What then? Shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid. 16 Know you not, that to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants you are whom you obey, whether it be of sin unto death,
<br>or of obedience unto justice.
<br>17	But thanks be to God, that you were the servants of sin, but have obeyed from the heart, unto that form of doctrine, into which you have been delivered.
<br>18	Being then freed from sin, we have been made servants of justice.
<br>19	I speak an human thing, because of the infirmity of your flesh. For as you have yielded your members to serve uncleanness and iniquity, unto iniquity; so now yield your members to serve justice, unto sanctification.
<br>20	For when you were the servants of sin, you were free men to justice.
<br>21	What fruit therefore had you then in those things, of which you are now ashamed? For the end of them is death.
<br>22	But now being made free from sin, and be- come servants to God, you have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end life everlasting.
<br>23	For the wages of sin is death. But the grace of God, life everlasting, in Christ Jesus our Lord.
<br>
<br>Chapter 7
<br>Know you not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) that the law hath dominion over a man, as long as it liveth?
<br>2	For the woman that hath an husband, whilst her husband liveth is bound to the law. But if
<br> 
<br>her husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.
<br>3	Therefore, whilst her husband liveth, she shall be called an adulteress, if she be with an- other man: but if her husband be dead, she is delivered from the law of her husband; so that she is not an adulteress, if she be with another man.
<br>4	Therefore, my brethren, you also are become dead to the law, by the body of Christ; that you may belong to another, who is risen again from the dead, that we may bring forth fruit to God. 5 For when we were in the flesh, the passions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our
<br>members, to bring forth fruit unto death.
<br>6	But now we are loosed from the law of death, wherein we were detained; so that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the old- ness of the letter.
<br>7	What shall we say, then? Is the law sin? God forbid. But I do not know sin, but by the law; for I had not known concupiscence, if the law did not say: Thou shalt not covet.
<br>8	But sin taking occasion by the command- ment, wrought in me all manner of concupis- cence. For without the law sin was dead.
<br>9	And I lived some time without the law. But when the commandment came, sin revived,
<br>10	And I died. And the commandment that was ordained to life, the same was found to be unto death to me.
<br>11	For sin, taking occasion by the command- ment, seduced me, and by it killed me.
<br>12	Wherefore the law indeed is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.
<br>13	Was that then which is good, made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it may ap- pear sin, by that which is good, wrought death in me; that sin, by the commandment, might become sinful above measure.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>14	For we know that the law is spiritual; but I am carnal, sold under sin.
<br>15	For that which I work, I understand not. For I do not that good which I will; but the evil which I hate, that I do.
<br>16	If then I do that which I will not, I consent to the law, that it is good.
<br>17	Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.
<br>18	For I know that there dwelleth not in me, that is to say, in my flesh, that which is good. For to will, is present with me; but to accomplish that which is good, I find not.
<br>19	For the good which I will, I do not; but the evil which I will not, that I do.
<br>20	Now if I do that which I will not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.
<br>21	I find then a law, that when I have a will to do good, evil is present with me.
<br>22	For I am delighted with the law of God, according to the inward man:
<br>23	But I see another law in my members, fight- ing against the law of my mind, and captivating me in the law of sin, that is in my members.
<br>24	Unhappy man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?
<br>25	The grace of God, by Jesus Christ our Lord. Therefore, I myself, with the mind serve the law of God; but with the flesh, the law of sin.
<br>
<br>Chapter 8
<br>There is now therefore no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, who walk not according to the flesh.
<br>2 For the law of the spirit of life, in Christ Jesus, hath delivered me from the law of sin and of death.
<br> 
<br>3	For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh; God sending his own Son, in the likeness of sinful flesh and of sin, hath condemned sin in the flesh;
<br>4	That the justification of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the spirit.
<br>5	For they that are according to the flesh, mind the things that are of the flesh; but they that are according to the spirit, mind the things that are of the spirit.
<br>6	For the wisdom of the flesh is death; but the wisdom of the spirit is life and peace.
<br>7	Because the wisdom of the flesh is an enemy to God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither can it be.
<br>8	And they who are in the flesh, cannot please God.
<br>9	But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.
<br>10	And if Christ be in you, the body indeed is dead, because of sin; but the spirit liveth, be- cause of justification.
<br>11	And if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead, dwell in you; he that raised up Jesus Christ from the dead, shall quicken also your mortal bodies, because of his Spirit that dwelleth in you.
<br>12	Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.
<br>13	For if you live according to the flesh, you shall die: but if by the Spirit you mortify the deeds of the flesh, you shall live.
<br>14	For whosoever are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
<br>15	For you have not received the spirit of bondage again in fear; but you have received the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>spirit of adoption of sons, whereby we cry: Abba (Father).
<br>16	For the Spirit himself giveth testimony to our spirit, that we are the sons of God.
<br>17	And if sons, heirs also; heirs indeed of God, and joint heirs with Christ: yet so, if we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified with him. 18 For I reckon that the sufferings of this time are not worthy to be compared with the glory to
<br>come, that shall be revealed in us.
<br>19	For the expectation of the creature waiteth for the revelation of the sons of God.
<br>20	For the creature was made subject to van- ity, not willingly, but by reason of him that made it subject, in hope:
<br>21	Because the creature also itself shall be de- livered from the servitude of corruption, into the liberty of the glory of the children of God.
<br>22	For we know that every creature groaneth and travaileth in pain, even till now.
<br>23	And not only it, but ourselves also, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we our- selves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption of the sons of God, the redemption of our body.
<br>24	For we are saved by hope. But hope that is seen, is not hope. For what a man seeth, why doth he hope for?
<br>25	But if we hope for that which we see not, we wait for it with patience.
<br>26	Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infir- mity. For we know not what we should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit himself asketh for us with unspeakable groanings.
<br>27	And he that searcheth the hearts, knoweth what the Spirit desireth; because he asketh for the saints according to God.
<br>28	And we know that to them that love God, all things work together unto good, to such as, according to his purpose, are called to be saints.
<br> 
<br>29	For whom he foreknew, he also predesti- nated to be made conformable to the image of his Son; that he might be the firstborn amongst many brethren.
<br>30	And whom he predestinated, them he also called. And whom he called, them he also justi- fied. And whom he justified, them he also glori- fied.
<br>31	What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who is against us?
<br>32	He that spared not even his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how hath he not also, with him, given us all things?
<br>33	Who shall accuse against the elect of God?
<br>God that justifieth.
<br>34	Who is he that shall condemn? Christ Je- sus that died, yea that is risen also again; who is at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.
<br>35	Who then shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation? or distress? or famine? or nakedness? or danger? or persecu- tion? or the sword?
<br>36	(As it is written: For thy sake we are put to death all the day long. We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.)
<br>37	But in all these things we overcome, be- cause of him that hath loved us.
<br>38	For I am sure that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor might,
<br>39	Nor height, nor depth, nor any other crea- ture, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
<br>
<br>Chapter 9
<br>I speak the truth in Christ, I lie not, my con- science bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>2	That I have great sadness, and continual sorrow in my heart.
<br>3	For I wished myself to be an anathema from Christ, for my brethren, who are my kinsmen according to the flesh,
<br>4	Who are Israelites, to whom belongeth the adoption as of children, and the glory, and the testament, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises:
<br>5	Whose are the fathers, and of whom is Christ, according to the flesh, who is over all things, God blessed for ever. Amen.
<br>6	Not as though the word of God hath miscar- ried. For all are not Israelites that are of Israel:
<br>7	Neither are all they that are the seed of Abraham, children; but in Isaac shall thy seed be called:
<br>8	That is to say, not they that are the chil- dren of the flesh, are the children of God; but they, that are the children of the promise, are accounted for the seed.
<br>9	For this is the word of promise: According to this time will I come; and Sara shall have a son.
<br>10	And not only she. But when Rebecca also had conceived at once, of Isaac our father.
<br>11	For when the children were not yet born, nor had done any good or evil (that the purpose of God, according to election, might stand,)
<br>12	Not of works, but of him that calleth, it was said to her: The elder shall serve the younger.
<br>13	As it is written: Jacob I have loved, but Esau I have hated.
<br>14	What shall we say then? Is there injustice with God? God forbid.
<br>15	For he saith to Moses: I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy; and I will shew mercy to whom I will shew mercy.
<br>16	So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth
<br> 
<br>mercy.
<br>17	For the scripture saith to Pharao: To this purpose have I raised thee, that I may shew my power in thee, and that my name may be de- clared throughout all the earth.
<br>18	Therefore he hath mercy on whom he will; and whom he will, he hardeneth.
<br>19	Thou wilt say therefore to me: Why doth he then find fault? for who resisteth his will?
<br>20	O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it: Why hast thou made me thus?
<br>21	Or hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump, to make one vessel unto hon- our, and another unto dishonour?
<br>22	What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath, fitted for de- struction,
<br>23	That he might shew the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he hath prepared unto glory?
<br>24	Even us, whom also he hath called, nor only of the Jews, but also of the Gentiles.
<br>25	As in Osee he saith: I will call that which was not my people, my people; and her that was not beloved, beloved; and her that had not ob- tained mercy, one that hath obtained mercy.
<br>26	And it shall be, in the place where it was said unto them, You are not my people; there they shall be called the sons of the living God.
<br>27	And Isaias crieth out concerning Israel: If the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved.
<br>28	For he shall finish his word, and cut it short in justice; because a short word shall the Lord make upon the earth.
<br>29	And as Isaias foretold: Unless the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been made as Sodom, and we had been like unto Gomorrha.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>30	What then shall we say? That the Gentiles, who followed not after justice, have attained to justice, even the justice that is of faith.
<br>31	But Israel, by following after the law of justice, is not come unto the law of justice.
<br>32	Why so? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were of works. For they stumbled at the stumblingstone.
<br>33	As it is written:   Behold I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and a rock of scandal; and whosoever believeth in him shall not be con- founded.
<br>
<br>Chapter 10
<br>Brethren, the will of my heart, indeed, and my prayer to God, is for them unto salvation.
<br>2	For I bear them witness, that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.
<br>3	For they, not knowing the justice of God, and seeking to establish their own, have not sub- mitted themselves to the justice of God.
<br>4	For the end of the law is Christ, unto justice to every one that believeth.
<br>5	For Moses wrote, that the justice which is of the law, the man that shall do it, shall live by it.
<br>6	But the justice which is of faith, speaketh thus: Say not in thy heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? that is, to bring Christ down;
<br>7	Or who shall descend into the deep? that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.
<br>8	But what saith the scripture? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart. This is the word of faith, which we preach.
<br>9	For if thou confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe in thy heart that God hath raised him up from the dead, thou shalt be saved. 10 For, with the heart, we believe unto justice;
<br> 
<br>but, with the mouth, confession is made unto salvation.
<br>11	For the scripture saith: Whosoever be- lieveth in him, shall not be confounded.
<br>12	For there is no distinction of the Jew and the Greek: for the same is Lord over all, rich unto all that call upon him.
<br>13	Fro whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord, shall be saved.
<br>14	How then shall they call on him, in whom they have not believed? Or how shall they be- lieve him, of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear, without a preacher?
<br>15	And how shall they preach unless they be sent, as it is written: How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, of them that bring glad tidings of good things!
<br>16	But all do not obey the gospel. For Isaias saith: Lord, who hath believed our report?
<br>17	Faith then cometh by hearing; and hearing by the word of Christ.
<br>18	But I say: Have they not heard? Yes, ver- ily, their sound hath gone forth into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the whole world. 19 But I say: Hath not Israel known? First, Moses saith: I will provoke you to jealousy by that which is not a nation; by a foolish nation I
<br>will anger you.
<br>20	But Isaias is bold, and saith: I was found by them that did not seek me: I appeared openly to them that asked not after me.
<br>21	But to Israel he saith: All the day long have I spread my hands to a people that believeth not, and contradicteth me.
<br>
<br>Chapter 11
<br>I say then: Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite of the seed of
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.
<br>2	God hath not cast away his people, which he foreknew. Know you not what the scripture saith of Elias; how he calleth on God against Israel?
<br>3	Lord, they have slain thy prophets, they have dug down thy altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.
<br>4	But what saith the divine answer to him? I have left me seven thousand men, that have not bowed their knees to Baal.
<br>5	Even so then at this present time also, there is a remnant saved according to the election of grace.
<br>6	And if by grace, it is not now by works: otherwise grace is no more grace.
<br>7	What then? That which Israel sought, he hath not obtained: but the election hath ob- tained it; and the rest have been blinded.
<br>8	As it is written: God hath given them the spirit of insensibility; eyes that they should not see; and ears that they should not hear, until this present day.
<br>9	And David saith: Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompense unto them.
<br>10	Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see: and bow down their back always.
<br>11	I say then, have they so stumbled, that they should fall? God forbid. But by their of- fence, salvation is come to the Gentiles, that they may be emulous of them.
<br>12	Now if the offence of them be the riches of the world, and the diminution of them, the riches of the Gentiles; how much more the fulness of them?
<br>13	For I say to you, Gentiles: as long indeed as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I will honour my ministry,
<br> 
<br>14	If, by any means, I may provoke to emula- tion them who are my flesh, and may save some of them.
<br>15	For if the loss of them be the reconciliation of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?
<br>16	For if the firstfruit be holy, so is the lump also: and if the root be holy, so are the branches. 17 And if some of the branches be broken, and thou, being a wild olive, art ingrafted in them, and art made partaker of the root, and of the
<br>fatness of the olive tree,
<br>18	Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.
<br>19	Thou wilt say then: The branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.
<br>20	Well: because of unbelief they were broken off. But thou standest by faith: be not high- minded, but fear.
<br>21	For if God hath not spared the natural branches, fear lest perhaps he also spare not thee.
<br>22	See then the goodness and the severity of God: towards them indeed that are fallen, the severity; but towards thee, the goodness of God, if thou abide in goodness, otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.
<br>23	And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.
<br>24	For if thou wert cut out of the wild olive tree, which is natural to thee; and, contrary to nature, were grafted into the good olive tree; how much more shall they that are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?
<br>25	For I would not have you ignorant, brethren, of this mystery, (lest you should be wise in your own conceits), that blindness in part has happened in Israel, until the fulness of the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Gentiles should come in.
<br>26	And so all Israel should be saved, as it is written: There shall come out of Sion, he that shall deliver, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob.
<br>27	And this is to them my covenant: when I shall take away their sins.
<br>28	As concerning the gospel, indeed, they are enemies for your sake: but as touching the elec- tion, they are most dear for the sake of the fa- thers.
<br>29	For the gifts and the calling of God are without repentance.
<br>30	For as you also in times past did not believe God, but now have obtained mercy, through their unbelief;
<br>31	So these also now have not believed, for your mercy, that they also may obtain mercy.
<br>32	For God hath concluded all in unbelief, that he may have mercy on all.
<br>33	O the depth of the riches of the wisdom and of the knowledge of God! How incomprehensi- ble are his judgments, and how unsearchable his ways!
<br>34	For who hath known the mind of the Lord?
<br>Or who hath been his counsellor?
<br>35	Or who hath first given to him, and rec- ompense shall be made him?
<br>36	For of him, and by him, and in him, are all things: to him be glory for ever. Amen.
<br>
<br>Chapter 12
<br>I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercy of God, that you present your bodies a living sac- rifice, holy, pleasing unto God, your reasonable service.
<br>2	And be not conformed to this world; but be reformed in the newness of your mind, that you
<br> 
<br>may prove what is the good, and the acceptable, and the perfect will of God.
<br>3	For I say, by the grace that is given me, to all that are among you, not to be more wise than it behoveth to be wise, but to be wise unto sobriety, and according as God hath divided to every one the measure of faith.
<br>4	For as in one body we have many members, but all the members have not the same office:
<br>5	So we being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.
<br>6	And having different gifts, according to the grace that is given us, either prophecy, to be used according to the rule of faith;
<br>7	Or ministry, in ministering; or he that tea- cheth, in doctrine;
<br>8	He that exhorteth, in exhorting; he that giveth, with simplicity; he that ruleth, with care- fulness; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerful- ness.
<br>9	Let love be without dissimulation. Hating that which is evil, cleaving to that which is good.
<br>10	Loving one another with the charity of brotherhood, with honour preventing one an- other.
<br>11	In carefulness not slothful. In spirit fer- vent. Serving the Lord.
<br>12	Rejoicing in hope. Patient in tribulation.
<br>Instant in prayer.
<br>13	Communicating to the necessities of the saints. Pursuing hospitality.
<br>14	Bless them that persecute you: bless, and curse not.
<br>15	Rejoice with them that rejoice; weep with them that weep.
<br>16	Being of one mind one towards another. Not minding high things, but consenting to the humble. Be not wise in your own conceits.
<br>17	To no man rendering evil for evil. Provid- ing good things, not only in the sight of God,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>but also in the sight of all men.
<br>18	If it be possible, as much as is in you, have peace with all men.
<br>19	Revenge not yourselves, my dearly beloved; but give place unto wrath, for it is written: Re- venge is mind, I will repay, saith the Lord.
<br>20	But if thy enemy be hungry, give him to eat; if he thirst, give him to drink. For, doing this, thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head. 21 Be not overcome by evil, but overcome evil
<br>by good.
<br>
<br>Chapter 13
<br>
<br>Let every soul be subject to higher powers: for there is no power but from God: and those that are, are ordained of God.
<br>2	Therefore he that resisteth the power, re- sisteth the ordinance of God. And they that resist, purchase to themselves damnation.
<br>3	For princes are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? Do that which is good: and thou shalt have praise from the same.
<br>4	For he is God’s minister to thee, for good. But if thou do that which is evil, fear: for he beareth not the sword in vain. For he is God’s minister: an avenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil.
<br>5	Wherefore be subject of necessity, not only for wrath, but also for conscience’ sake.
<br>6	For therefore also you pay tribute. For they are the ministers of God, serving unto this pur- pose.
<br>7	Render therefore to all men their dues. Trib- ute, to whom tribute is due: custom, to whom custom: fear, to whom fear: honour, to whom honour.
<br> 
<br>8	Owe no man any thing, but to love one an- other. For he that loveth his neighbour, hath fulfilled the law.
<br>9	For Thou shalt not commit adultery: Thou shalt not kill: Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness: Thou shalt not covet: and if there be any other commandment, it is com- prised in this word, Thou shalt love thy neigh- bour as thyself.
<br>10	The love of our neighbour worketh no evil.
<br>Love therefore is the fulfilling of the law.
<br>11	And that knowing the season; that it is now the hour for us to rise from sleep. For now our salvation is nearer than when we believed.
<br>12	The night is passed, and the day is at hand. Let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and put on the armour of light.
<br>13	Let us walk honestly, as in the day: not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and impurities, not in contention and envy:
<br>14	But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh in its concupis- cences.
