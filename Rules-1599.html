<br>Editorial Notes
<br>Codification
<br>
<br>When originally enacted, section 5 of act June 22, 1936, which consisted of a paragraph (including a proviso) authorizing works of improvement followed by numerous headings and paragraphs describing those authorized works, was not classified to the Code. Act July 19, 1937, amended section 5 of act June 22, 1936, by inserting two additional provisos at the end of the first paragraph. The provisos inserted by the 1937 Act, as amended, form the sole basis for the text appearing in this section, with minor editorial changes to the introductory language of the provisos. Subsequent amendments to section 5 of act June 22, 1936, have generally been directed to the text of section 5 as it has appeared in the Code and have not taken into account the portion of that section that has never been set out. Those amendments have been executed as directed, to reflect the probable intent of Congress, and amendment notes below reflect such execution without further comment.

<br>§701n. Emergency response to natural disasters
<br>(a) Emergency fund
<br>
<br>(1) There is authorized an emergency fund to be expended in preparation for emergency response to any natural disaster, in flood fighting and rescue operations, or in the repair or restoration of any flood control work threatened or destroyed by flood, including the strengthening, raising, extending, realigning, or other modification thereof as may be necessary in the discretion of the Chief of Engineers for the adequate functioning of the work for flood control and subject to the condition that the Chief of Engineers may include modifications to the structure or project, or in implementation of nonstructural alternatives to the repair or restoration of such flood control work if requested by the non-Federal sponsor; in the emergency protection of federally authorized hurricane or shore protection being threatened when in the discretion of the Chief of Engineers such protection is warranted to protect against imminent and substantial loss to life and property; in the repair and restoration of any federally authorized hurricane or shore protective structure or project damaged or destroyed by wind, wave, or water action of other than an ordinary nature to either the pre-storm level or the design level of protection, whichever provides greater protection, when, in the discretion of the Chief of Engineers, such repair and restoration is warranted for the adequate functioning of the structure or project for hurricane or shore protection, subject to the condition that the Chief of Engineers may include modifications to the structure or project to address major deficiencies or implement nonstructural alternatives to the repair or restoration of the structure if requested by the non-Federal sponsor. The emergency fund may also be expended for emergency dredging for restoration of authorized project depths for Federal navigable channels and waterways made necessary by flood, drought, earthquake, or other natural disasters. In any case in which the Chief of Engineers is otherwise performing work under this section in an area for which the Governor of the affected State has requested a determination that an emergency exists or a declaration that a major disaster exists under the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act [42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.], the Chief of Engineers is further authorized to perform on public and private lands and waters for a period of ten days following the Governor's request any emergency work made necessary by such emergency or disaster which is essential for the preservation of life and property, including, but not limited to, channel clearance, emergency shore protection, clearance and removal of debris and wreckage endangering public health and safety, and temporary restoration of essential public facilities and services. The Chief of Engineers, in the exercise of his discretion, is further authorized to provide emergency supplies of clean water, on such terms as he determines to be advisable, to any locality which he finds is confronted with a source of contaminated water causing or likely to cause a substantial threat to the public health and welfare of the inhabitants of the locality. The appropriation of such moneys for the initial establishment of this fund and for its replenishment on an annual basis, is authorized: Provided, That pending the appropriation of sums to such emergency fund, the Secretary of the Army may allot, from existing flood-control appropriations, such sums as may be necessary for the immediate prosecution of the work herein authorized, such appropriations to be reimbursed from the appropriation herein authorized when made. The Chief of Engineers is authorized, in the prosecution of work in connection with rescue operations, or in conducting other flood emergency work, to acquire on a rental basis such motor vehicles, including passenger cars and buses, as in his discretion are deemed necessary.
<br>
<br>(2) Cost and benefit feasibility assessment.—
<br>
<br>(A) Consideration of benefits.—In preparing a cost and benefit feasibility assessment for any emergency project described in paragraph (1), the Chief of Engineers shall consider the benefits to be gained by such project for the protection of—
<br>
<br>(i) residential establishments;
<br>
<br>(ii) commercial establishments, including the protection of inventory; and
<br>
<br>(iii) agricultural establishments, including the protection of crops.
<br>
<br>(B) Special conditions.—
<br>
<br>(i) Authority to carry out work.—The Chief of Engineers may carry out repair or restoration work described in paragraph (1) that does not produce benefits greater than the cost if—
<br>
<br>(I) the non-Federal sponsor agrees to pay, or provide contributions equal to, an amount sufficient to make the remaining costs of the project equal to the estimated value of the benefits of the repair or restoration work; and
<br>
<br>(II) the Secretary determines that—
<br>
<br>(aa) the damage to the structure was not a result of negligent operation or maintenance; and
<br>
<br>(bb) repair of the project could benefit another Corps project.
<br>
<br>(ii) Treatment of payments and contributions.—Non-Federal payments or contributions pursuant to clause (i) shall be in addition to any non-Federal payments or contributions required by the Chief of Engineers that are applicable to the remaining costs of the repair or restoration work.
<br>

<br>
<br>The terms "natural feature" and "nature-based feature" have the meanings given those terms in section 2289a of this title.
<br>(b) Program
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary is authorized to carry out a program to study, design, and construct water resources development projects through measures involving, among other things, strengthening, raising, extending, realigning, or otherwise modifying existing flood control works, designing new works, and incorporating natural features, nature-based features, or nonstructural features, as appropriate to provide flood and coastal storm risk management to affected communities.
<br>(2) Considerations
<br>
<br>In carrying out paragraph (1), the Secretary shall, to the maximum extent practical, review and, where appropriate, incorporate natural features or nature-based features, or a combination of such features and nonstructural features, that avoid or reduce at least 50 percent of flood or storm damages in one or more of the alternatives included in the final alternatives evaluated.
<br>(3) Construction
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary may carry out a project described in paragraph (1) without further congressional authorization if—
<br>
<br>(i) the Secretary determines that the project—
<br>
<br>(I) is advisable to reduce the risk of flooding for an affected community; and
<br>
<br>(II) produces benefits that are in excess of the estimated costs; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the Federal share of the cost of the construction does not exceed $17,500,000.
<br>(B) Specific authorization
<br>
<br>If the Federal share of the cost of a project described in paragraph (1) exceeds $17,500,000, the Secretary shall submit the project recommendation to Congress for authorization prior to construction, and shall include the project recommendation in the next annual report submitted under section 2282d of this title.
<br>(C) Financing
<br>(i) Contributions
<br>
<br>If, based on a study carried out pursuant to paragraph (1), the Secretary determines that a project described in paragraph (1) will not produce benefits greater than cost, the Secretary shall allow the affected community to pay, or provide contributions equal to, an amount sufficient to make the remaining costs of design and construction of the project equal to the estimated value of the benefits of the project.
<br>(ii) Effect on non-Federal share
<br>
<br>Amounts provided by an affected community under clause (i) shall be in addition to any payments or contributions the affected community is required to provide toward the remaining costs of design and construction of the project under section 2213 of this title.
<br>(4) Ability to pay
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Any cost-sharing agreement for a project entered into pursuant to this section shall be subject to the ability of the affected community to pay.
<br>(B) Determination
<br>
<br>The ability of any affected community to pay shall be determined by the Secretary in accordance with procedures established by the Secretary.
<br>(C) Effect of reduction
<br>
<br>Any reduction in the non-Federal share of the cost of a project described in paragraph (1) as a result of a determination under this paragraph shall not be included in the Federal share for purposes of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (3).

<br>§701r–1. Utilization of public roads
<br>(a) Definitions
<br>
<br>When used in this section—
<br>
<br>(1) The term "Agency" means the Corps of Engineers, United States Army or the Bureau of Reclamation, United States Department of the Interior, whichever has jurisdiction over the project concerned.
<br>
<br>(2) The term "head of the Agency concerned" means the Chief of Engineers or the Commissioner, Bureau of Reclamation, or their respective designees.
<br>
<br>(3) The term "water resources projects to be constructed in the future" includes all projects not yet actually under construction, and, to the extent of work remaining to be completed, includes projects presently under construction where road relocations or identifiable components thereof are not complete as of the date of this section.
<br>
<br>(4) The term "time of the taking" is the date of the relocation agreement, the date of the filing of a condemnation proceeding, or a date agreed upon between the parties as the date of taking.
<br>(b) Improvement, reconstruction, and maintenance
<br>
<br>Whenever, in connection with the construction of any authorized flood control, navigation, irrigation, or multiple purpose project for the development of water resources, the head of the Agency concerned determines it to be in the public interest to utilize existing public roads as a means of providing access to such projects during construction, such Agency may improve, reconstruct, and maintain such roads and may contract with the local authority having jurisdiction over the roads to accomplish the necessary work. The accomplishment of such work of improvement may be carried out with or without obtaining any interest in the land on which the road is located in accordance with mutual agreement between the parties: Provided, (1) That the head of the Agency concerned determines that such work would result in a saving in Federal cost as opposed to the cost of providing a new access road at Federal expense, (2) that, at the completion of construction, the head of the Agency concerned will, if necessary, restore the road to at least as good condition as prior to the beginning of utilization for access during construction, and (3) that, at the completion of construction, the responsibility of the Agency for improvement, reconstruction, and maintenance shall cease.
<br>(c) Replacement roads; construction to higher standards
<br>
<br>For water resources projects to be constructed in the future, when the taking by the Federal Government of an existing public road necessitates replacement, the substitute provided will, as nearly as practicable, serve in the same manner and reasonably as well as the existing road. The head of the agency concerned is authorized to construct such substitute roads to the design standards which the State or owning political division would use in constructing a new road under similar conditions of geography and under similar traffic loads (present and projected). In any case where a State or political subdivision thereof requests that such a substitute road be constructed to a higher standard than that provided for in the preceding provisions of this subsection, and pays, prior to commencement of such construction, the additional costs involved due to such higher standard, such agency head is authorized to construct such road to such higher standard. Federal costs under the provisions of this subsection shall be part of the nonreimbursable project costs.

<br>§701s. Small flood control projects; appropriations; amount limitation for single locality; conditions
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Army is authorized to allot from any appropriations heretofore or hereafter made for flood control, not to exceed $68,750,000 for any one fiscal year, for the implementation of small structural and nonstructural projects, and projects that use natural features or nature-based features (as those terms are defined in section 2289a(a) of this title), for flood control and related purposes not specifically authorized by Congress, which come within the provisions of section 701a of this title, when in the opinion of the Chief of Engineers such work is advisable.
