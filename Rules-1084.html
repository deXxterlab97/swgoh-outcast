<br>
<br>(i) affect the safety or effectiveness of the drug; or
<br>
<br>(ii) materially affect the extent of absorption or other exposure to the active ingredient in comparison to a suitable reference product,
<br>
<br>the drug as modified is a new drug under section 321(p) of this title and shall be deemed to be misbranded under section 352(ee) of this title.
<br>(3) Determining whether a change will affect safety or effectiveness
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall issue one or more administrative orders specifying requirements for determining whether a minor change made by a sponsor pursuant to this subsection will affect the safety or effectiveness of a drug or materially affect the extent of absorption or other exposure to an active ingredient in the drug in comparison to a suitable reference product, together with guidance for applying those orders to specific dosage forms.
<br>(B) Standard practices
<br>
<br>The orders and guidance issued by the Secretary under subparagraph (A) shall take into account relevant public standards and standard practices for evaluating the quality of drugs, and may take into account the special needs of populations, including children.
<br>(d) Confidentiality of information submitted to the Secretary
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Subject to paragraph (2), any information, including reports of testing conducted on the drug or drugs involved, that is submitted by a requestor in connection with proceedings on an order under this section (including any minor change under subsection (c)) and is a trade secret or confidential information subject to section 552(b)(4) of title 5 or section 1905 of title 18 shall not be disclosed to the public unless the requestor consents to that disclosure.
<br>(2) Public availability
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall—

<br>§356. Expedited approval of drugs for serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions
<br>(a) Designation of a drug as a breakthrough therapy
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall, at the request of the sponsor of a drug, expedite the development and review of such drug if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with 1 or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on 1 or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. (In this section, such a drug is referred to as a "breakthrough therapy".)
<br>(2) Request for designation
<br>
<br>The sponsor of a drug may request the Secretary to designate the drug as a breakthrough therapy. A request for the designation may be made concurrently with, or at any time after, the submission of an application for the investigation of the drug under section 355(i) of this title or section 351(a)(3) of the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 262(a)(3)].
<br>(3) Designation
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Not later than 60 calendar days after the receipt of a request under paragraph (2), the Secretary shall determine whether the drug that is the subject of the request meets the criteria described in paragraph (1). If the Secretary finds that the drug meets the criteria, the Secretary shall designate the drug as a breakthrough therapy and shall take such actions as are appropriate to expedite the development and review of the application for approval of such drug.
<br>(B) Actions
<br>
<br>The actions to expedite the development and review of an application under subparagraph (A) may include, as appropriate—
<br>
<br>(i) holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the drug;
<br>
<br>(ii) providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the nonclinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as practicable;
<br>
<br>(iii) involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review;
<br>
<br>(iv) assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the Food and Drug Administration review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor; and
<br>
<br>(v) taking steps to ensure that the design of the clinical trials is as efficient as practicable, when scientifically appropriate, such as by minimizing the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment.
<br>(b) Designation of drug as fast track product
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall, at the request of the sponsor of a new drug, facilitate the development and expedite the review of such drug if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition, or if the Secretary designates the drug as a qualified infectious disease product under section 355f(d) of this title. (In this section, such a drug is referred to as a "fast track product".)
<br>(2) Request for designation
<br>
<br>The sponsor of a new drug may request the Secretary to designate the drug as a fast track product. A request for the designation may be made concurrently with, or at any time after, submission of an application for the investigation of the drug under section 355(i) of this title or section 351(a)(3) of the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 262(a)(3)].
<br>(3) Designation
<br>
<br>Within 60 calendar days after the receipt of a request under paragraph (2), the Secretary shall determine whether the drug that is the subject of the request meets the criteria described in paragraph (1). If the Secretary finds that the drug meets the criteria, the Secretary shall designate the drug as a fast track product and shall take such actions as are appropriate to expedite the development and review of the application for approval of such product.
<br>(c) Accelerated approval of a drug for a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, including a fast track product
<br>(1) In general
<br>(A) Accelerated approval
<br>
<br>The Secretary may approve an application for approval of a product for a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, including a fast track product, under section 355(c) of this title or section 351(a) of the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 262(a)] upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. The approval described in the preceding sentence is referred to in this section as "accelerated approval".
<br>(B) Evidence
<br>
<br>The evidence to support that an endpoint is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit under subparagraph (A) may include epidemiological, pathophysiological, therapeutic, pharmacologic, or other evidence developed using biomarkers, for example, or other scientific methods or tools.
<br>(2) Limitation
<br>
<br>Approval of a product under this subsection may be subject to 1 or both of the following requirements:
<br>
<br>(A) That the sponsor conduct appropriate postapproval studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit.
<br>
<br>(B) That the sponsor submit copies of all promotional materials related to the product during the preapproval review period and, following approval and for such period thereafter as the Secretary determines to be appropriate, at least 30 days prior to dissemination of the materials.
<br>(3) Expedited withdrawal of approval
<br>
<br>The Secretary may withdraw approval of a product approved under accelerated approval using expedited procedures (as prescribed by the Secretary in regulations which shall include an opportunity for an informal hearing) if—
<br>
<br>(A) the sponsor fails to conduct any required postapproval study of the drug with due diligence;
<br>
<br>(B) a study required to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit of the product fails to verify and describe such effect or benefit;
<br>
<br>(C) other evidence demonstrates that the product is not safe or effective under the conditions of use; or
<br>
<br>(D) the sponsor disseminates false or misleading promotional materials with respect to the product.
<br>(d) Review of incomplete applications for approval of a fast track product
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>If the Secretary determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a fast track product may be effective, the Secretary shall evaluate for filing, and may commence review of portions of, an application for the approval of the product before the sponsor submits a complete application. The Secretary shall commence such review only if the applicant—
<br>
<br>(A) provides a schedule for submission of information necessary to make the application complete; and
<br>
<br>(B) pays any fee that may be required under section 379h of this title.
<br>(2) Exception
<br>
<br>Any time period for review of human drug applications that has been agreed to by the Secretary and that has been set forth in goals identified in letters of the Secretary (relating to the use of fees collected under section 379h of this title to expedite the drug development process and the review of human drug applications) shall not apply to an application submitted under paragraph (1) until the date on which the application is complete.
<br>(e) Construction
<br>(1) Purpose
<br>
<br>The amendments made by the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act and the 21st Century Cures Act to this section are intended to encourage the Secretary to utilize innovative and flexible approaches to the assessment of products under accelerated approval for treatments for patients with serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and unmet medical needs.
<br>(2) Construction
<br>
<br>Nothing in this section shall be construed to alter the standards of evidence under subsection (c) or (d) of section 355 of this title (including the substantial evidence standard in section 355(d) of this title) or under section 351(a) of the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 262(a)]. Such sections and standards of evidence apply to the review and approval of products under this section, including whether a product is safe and effective. Nothing in this section alters the ability of the Secretary to rely on evidence that does not come from adequate and well-controlled investigations for the purpose of determining whether an endpoint is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit as described in subsection (b)(1)(B).
<br>(f) Awareness efforts
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall—
<br>
<br>(1) develop and disseminate to physicians, patient organizations, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and other appropriate persons a description of the provisions of this section applicable to breakthrough therapies, accelerated approval, and and 1 fast track products; and
<br>
<br>(2) establish a program to encourage the development of surrogate and clinical endpoints, including biomarkers, and other scientific methods and tools that can assist the Secretary in determining whether the evidence submitted in an application is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit for serious or life-threatening conditions for which significant unmet medical needs exist.
<br>(g) Regenerative advanced therapy
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary, at the request of the sponsor of a drug, shall facilitate an efficient development program for, and expedite review of, such drug if the drug qualifies as a regenerative advanced therapy under the criteria described in paragraph (2).
<br>(2) Criteria
<br>
<br>A drug is eligible for designation as a regenerative advanced therapy under this subsection if—
<br>
<br>(A) the drug is a regenerative medicine therapy (as defined in paragraph (8));
<br>
<br>(B) the drug is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and
<br>
<br>(C) preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition.
<br>(3) Request for designation
<br>
<br>The sponsor of a drug may request the Secretary to designate the drug as a regenerative advanced therapy concurrently with, or at any time after, submission of an application for the investigation of the drug under section 355(i) of this title or section 351(a)(3) of the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 262(a)(3)].
<br>(4) Designation
<br>
<br>Not later than 60 calendar days after the receipt of a request under paragraph (3), the Secretary shall determine whether the drug that is the subject of the request meets the criteria described in paragraph (2). If the Secretary determines that the drug meets the criteria, the Secretary shall designate the drug as a regenerative advanced therapy and shall take such actions as are appropriate under paragraph (1). If the Secretary determines that a drug does not meet the criteria for such designation, the Secretary shall include with the determination a written description of the rationale for such determination.
<br>(5) Actions
<br>
<br>The sponsor of a regenerative advanced therapy shall be eligible for the actions to expedite development and review of such therapy under subsection (a)(3)(B), including early interactions to discuss any potential surrogate or intermediate endpoint to be used to support the accelerated approval of an application for the product under subsection (c).
<br>(6) Access to expedited approval pathways
<br>
<br>An application for a regenerative advanced therapy under section 355(b)(1) of this title or section 351(a) of the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 262(a)] may be—
<br>
<br>(A) eligible for priority review, as described in the Manual of Policies and Procedures of the Food and Drug Administration and goals identified in the letters described in section 101(b) of the Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments of 2012; and
<br>
<br>(B) eligible for accelerated approval under subsection (c), as agreed upon pursuant to subsection (a)(3)(B), through, as appropriate—
<br>
<br>(i) surrogate or intermediate endpoints reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit; or
<br>
<br>(ii) reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites, including through expansion to additional sites, as appropriate.
<br>(7) Postapproval requirements
<br>
<br>The sponsor of a regenerative advanced therapy that is granted accelerated approval and is subject to the postapproval requirements under subsection (c) may, as appropriate, fulfill such requirements, as the Secretary may require, through—
<br>
<br>(A) the submission of clinical evidence, clinical studies, patient registries, or other sources of real world evidence, such as electronic health records;
<br>
<br>(B) the collection of larger confirmatory data sets, as agreed upon pursuant to subsection (a)(3)(B); or
<br>
<br>(C) postapproval monitoring of all patients treated with such therapy prior to approval of the therapy.
<br>(8) Definition
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, the term "regenerative medicine therapy" includes cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering products, human cell and tissue products, and combination products using any such therapies or products, except for those regulated solely under section 361 of the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 264] and part 1271 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations.
<br>(h) Limited population pathway for antibacterial and antifungal drugs

<br>(A) the drug is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening infection in a limited population of patients with unmet needs;
<br>
<br>(B) the standards for approval under section 355(c) and (d) of this title, or the standards for licensure under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 262], as applicable, are met; and
<br>
<br>(C) the Secretary receives a written request from the sponsor to approve the drug as a limited population drug pursuant to this subsection.
<br>(2) Benefit-risk consideration
<br>
<br>The Secretary's determination of safety and effectiveness of an antibacterial or antifungal drug shall reflect the benefit-risk profile of such drug in the intended limited population, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the infection the drug is intended to treat and the availability or lack of alternative treatment in such limited population. Such drug may be approved under this subsection notwithstanding a lack of evidence to fully establish a favorable benefit-risk profile in a population that is broader than the intended limited population.
<br>(3) Additional requirements
<br>
<br>A drug approved under this subsection shall be subject to the following requirements, in addition to any other applicable requirements of this chapter:
<br>(A) Labeling
<br>
<br>To indicate that the safety and effectiveness of a drug approved under this subsection has been demonstrated only with respect to a limited population—
<br>
<br>(i) all labeling and advertising of an antibacterial or antifungal drug approved under this subsection shall contain the statement "Limited Population" in a prominent manner and adjacent to, and not more prominent than—
<br>
<br>(I) the proprietary name of such drug, if any; or
<br>
<br>(II) if there is no proprietary name, the established name of the drug, if any, as defined in section 353(e)(3) of this title, or, in the case of a drug that is a biological product, the proper name, as defined by regulation; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the prescribing information for the drug required by section 201.57 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (or any successor regulation) shall also include the following statement: "This drug is indicated for use in a limited and specific population of patients.".
<br>(B) Promotional material
<br>
<br>The sponsor of an antibacterial or antifungal drug subject to this subsection shall submit to the Secretary copies of all promotional materials related to such drug at least 30 calendar days prior to dissemination of the materials.
<br>(4) Other programs
<br>
<br>A sponsor of a drug that seeks approval of a drug under this subsection may also seek designation or approval, as applicable, of such drug under other applicable sections or subsections of this chapter or the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.].
<br>(5) Guidance
<br>
<br>Not later than 18 months after December 13, 2016, the Secretary shall issue draft guidance describing criteria, processes, and other general considerations for demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of limited population antibacterial and antifungal drugs. The Secretary shall publish final guidance within 18 months of the close of the public comment period on such draft guidance. The Secretary may approve antibacterial and antifungal drugs under this subsection prior to issuing guidance under this paragraph.
<br>(6) Advice
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall provide prompt advice to the sponsor of a drug for which the sponsor seeks approval under this subsection to enable the sponsor to plan a development program to obtain the necessary data for such approval, and to conduct any additional studies that would be required to gain approval of such drug for use in a broader population.
<br>(7) Termination of limitations
<br>
<br>If, after approval of a drug under this subsection, the Secretary approves a broader indication for such drug under section 355(b) of this title or section 351(a) of the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 262(a)], the Secretary may remove any postmarketing conditions, including requirements with respect to labeling and review of promotional materials under paragraph (3), applicable to the approval of the drug under this subsection.

<br>Findings and Sense of Congress on Enhancement of Accelerated Patient Access to New Medical Treatments
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 112–144, title IX, §901(a), July 9, 2012, 126 Stat. 1082, as amended by Pub. L. 114–255, div. A, title III, §3101(b)(1), Dec. 13, 2016, 130 Stat. 1156, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(1) Findings.—Congress finds as follows:
<br>
<br>"(A) The Food and Drug Administration (referred to in this section as the 'FDA') serves a critical role in helping to assure that new medicines are safe and effective. Regulatory innovation is 1 element of the Nation's strategy to address serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions by promoting investment in and development of innovative treatments for unmet medical needs.
<br>
<br>"(B) During the 2 decades following the establishment of the accelerated approval mechanism, advances in medical sciences, including genomics, molecular biology, and bioinformatics, have provided an unprecedented understanding of the underlying biological mechanism and pathogenesis of disease. A new generation of modern, targeted medicines is under development to treat serious and life-threatening diseases, some applying drug development strategies based on biomarkers or pharmacogenomics, predictive toxicology, clinical trial enrichment techniques, and novel clinical trial designs, such as adaptive clinical trials.
<br>
<br>"(C) As a result of these remarkable scientific and medical advances, the FDA should be encouraged to implement more broadly effective processes for the expedited development and review of innovative new medicines intended to address unmet medical needs for serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions, including those for rare diseases or conditions, using a broad range of surrogate or clinical endpoints and modern scientific tools earlier in the drug development cycle when appropriate. This may result in fewer, smaller, or shorter clinical trials for the intended patient population or targeted subpopulation without compromising or altering the high standards of the FDA for the approval of drugs.
<br>
<br>"(D) Patients benefit from expedited access to safe and effective innovative therapies to treat unmet medical needs for serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions.
<br>
<br>"(E) For these reasons, the statutory authority in effect on the day before the date of enactment of this Act [July 9, 2012] governing expedited approval of drugs for serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions should be amended in order to enhance the authority of the FDA to consider appropriate scientific data, methods, and tools, and to expedite development and access to novel treatments for patients with a broad range of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions.
<br>
<br>"(2) Sense of congress.—It is the sense of Congress that the Food and Drug Administration should apply the accelerated approval and fast track provisions set forth in section 506 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 356), as amended by this section, to help expedite the development and availability to patients of treatments for serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions while maintaining safety and effectiveness standards for such treatments."
<br>Guidance; Amended Regulations
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 112–144, title IX, §901(c), July 9, 2012, 126 Stat. 1085, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(1) Draft guidance.—Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act [July 9, 2012], the Secretary of Health and Human Services (referred to in this section as the 'Secretary') shall issue draft guidance to implement the amendments made by this section [amending this section]. In developing such guidance, the Secretary shall specifically consider issues arising under the accelerated approval and fast track processes under section 506 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 356], as amended by subsection (b), for drugs designated for a rare disease or condition under section 526 of such Act (21 U.S.C. 360bb) and shall also consider any unique issues associated with very rare diseases.
<br>
<br>"(2) Final guidance.—Not later than 1 year after the issuance of draft guidance under paragraph (1), and after an opportunity for public comment, the Secretary shall—
<br>
<br>"(A) issue final guidance; and
<br>
<br>"(B) amend the regulations governing accelerated approval in parts 314 and 601 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, as necessary to conform such regulations with the amendment made by subsection (b).
<br>
<br>"(3) Consideration.—In developing the guidance under paragraphs (1) and (2)(A) and the amendments under paragraph (2)(B), the Secretary shall consider how to incorporate novel approaches to the review of surrogate endpoints based on pathophysiologic and pharmacologic evidence in such guidance, especially in instances where the low prevalence of a disease renders the existence or collection of other types of data unlikely or impractical.
<br>
<br>"(4) Conforming changes.—The Secretary shall issue, as necessary, conforming amendments to the applicable regulations under title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, governing accelerated approval.
<br>
<br>"(5) No effect of inaction on requests.—The issuance (or nonissuance) of guidance or conforming regulations implementing the amendment made by subsection (b) shall not preclude the review of, or action on, a request for designation or an application for approval submitted pursuant to section 506 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 356], as amended by subsection (b)."

<br>
<br>"(ii) Procedure.—In amending regulations under clause (i), the Secretary shall—
<br>
<br>"(I) issue a notice of proposed rulemaking that includes the proposed regulation;
<br>
<br>"(II) provide a period of not less than 60 days for comments on the proposed regulation; and
<br>
<br>"(III) publish the final regulation not less than 30 days before the effective date of the regulation.
<br>
<br>"(iii) Restrictions.—Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary shall promulgate regulations implementing the amendments made by this section only as described in clause (ii).
<br>
<br>"(2) Requirements.—Guidance issued under this section shall—
<br>
<br>"(A) specify the process and criteria by which the Secretary makes a designation under section 506(a)(3) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 356(a)(3)]; and
<br>
<br>"(B) specify the actions the Secretary shall take to expedite the development and review of a breakthrough therapy pursuant to such designation under such section 506(a)(3), including updating good review management practices to reflect breakthrough therapies."

<br>§356a. Manufacturing changes
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>With respect to a drug for which there is in effect an approved application under section 355 or 360b of this title or a license under section 262 of title 42, a change from the manufacturing process approved pursuant to such application or license may be made, and the drug as made with the change may be distributed, if—
<br>
<br>(1) the holder of the approved application or license (referred to in this section as a "holder") has validated the effects of the change in accordance with subsection (b); and
<br>
<br>(2)(A) in the case of a major manufacturing change, the holder has complied with the requirements of subsection (c); or
<br>
<br>(B) in the case of a change that is not a major manufacturing change, the holder complies with the applicable requirements of subsection (d).
<br>(b) Validation of effects of changes
<br>
<br>For purposes of subsection (a)(1), a drug made with a manufacturing change (whether a major manufacturing change or otherwise) may be distributed only if, before distribution of the drug as so made, the holder involved validates the effects of the change on the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the drug as the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug.
<br>(c) Major manufacturing changes
<br>(1) Requirement of supplemental application
<br>
<br>For purposes of subsection (a)(2)(A), a drug made with a major manufacturing change may be distributed only if, before the distribution of the drug as so made, the holder involved submits to the Secretary a supplemental application for such change and the Secretary approves the application. The application shall contain such information as the Secretary determines to be appropriate, and shall include the information developed under subsection (b) by the holder in validating the effects of the change.
<br>(2) Changes qualifying as major changes
<br>
<br>For purposes of subsection (a)(2)(A), a major manufacturing change is a manufacturing change that is determined by the Secretary to have substantial potential to adversely affect the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the drug as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of a drug. Such a change includes a change that—
<br>
<br>(A) is made in the qualitative or quantitative formulation of the drug involved or in the specifications in the approved application or license referred to in subsection (a) for the drug (unless exempted by the Secretary by regulation or guidance from the requirements of this subsection);
<br>
<br>(B) is determined by the Secretary by regulation or guidance to require completion of an appropriate clinical study demonstrating equivalence of the drug to the drug as manufactured without the change; or
<br>
<br>(C) is another type of change determined by the Secretary by regulation or guidance to have a substantial potential to adversely affect the safety or effectiveness of the drug.
<br>(d) Other manufacturing changes
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>For purposes of subsection (a)(2)(B), the Secretary may regulate drugs made with manufacturing changes that are not major manufacturing changes as follows:
<br>
<br>(A) The Secretary may in accordance with paragraph (2) authorize holders to distribute such drugs without submitting a supplemental application for such changes.
<br>
<br>(B) The Secretary may in accordance with paragraph (3) require that, prior to the distribution of such drugs, holders submit to the Secretary supplemental applications for such changes.
<br>
<br>(C) The Secretary may establish categories of such changes and designate categories to which subparagraph (A) applies and categories to which subparagraph (B) applies.
<br>(2) Changes not requiring supplemental application
<br>(A) Submission of report
<br>
<br>A holder making a manufacturing change to which paragraph (1)(A) applies shall submit to the Secretary a report on the change, which shall contain such information as the Secretary determines to be appropriate, and which shall include the information developed under subsection (b) by the holder in validating the effects of the change. The report shall be submitted by such date as the Secretary may specify.
<br>(B) Authority regarding annual reports
<br>
<br>In the case of a holder that during a single year makes more than one manufacturing change to which paragraph (1)(A) applies, the Secretary may in carrying out subparagraph (A) authorize the holder to comply with such subparagraph by submitting a single report for the year that provides the information required in such subparagraph for all the changes made by the holder during the year.
<br>(3) Changes requiring supplemental application
<br>(A) Submission of supplemental application
<br>
<br>The supplemental application required under paragraph (1)(B) for a manufacturing change shall contain such information as the Secretary determines to be appropriate, which shall include the information developed under subsection (b) by the holder in validating the effects of the change.

<br>Executive Documents
<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13588. Reducing Prescription Drug Shortages
<br>
<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13588, Oct. 31, 2011, 76 F.R. 68295, provided:
<br>
<br>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:
<br>
<br>Section 1. Policy. Shortages of pharmaceutical drugs pose a serious and growing threat to public health. While a very small number of drugs in the United States experience a shortage in any given year, the number of prescription drug shortages in the United States nearly tripled between 2005 and 2010, and shortages are becoming more severe as well as more frequent. The affected medicines include cancer treatments, anesthesia drugs, and other drugs that are critical to the treatment and prevention of serious diseases and life-threatening conditions.
<br>
<br>For example, over approximately the last 5 years, data indicates that the use of sterile injectable cancer treatments has increased by about 20 percent, without a corresponding increase in production capacity. While manufacturers are currently in the process of expanding capacity, it may be several years before production capacity has been significantly increased. Interruptions in the supplies of these drugs endanger patient safety and burden doctors, hospitals, pharmacists, and patients. They also increase health care costs, particularly because some participants in the market may use shortages as opportunities to hoard scarce drugs or charge exorbitant prices.
<br>
<br>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the Department of Health and Human Services has been working diligently to address this problem through its existing regulatory framework. While the root problems and many of their solutions are outside of the FDA's control, the agency has worked cooperatively with manufacturers to prevent or mitigate shortages by expediting review of certain regulatory submissions and adopting a flexible approach to drug manufacturing and importation regulations where appropriate. As a result, the FDA prevented 137 drug shortages in 2010 and 2011. Despite these successes, however, the problem of drug shortages has continued to grow.
<br>
<br>Many different factors contribute to drug shortages, and solving this critical public health problem will require a multifaceted approach. An important factor in many of the recent shortages appears to be an increase in demand that exceeds current manufacturing capacity. While manufacturers are in the process of expanding capacity, one important step is ensuring that the FDA and the public receive adequate advance notice of shortages whenever possible. The FDA cannot begin to work with manufacturers or use the other tools at its disposal until it knows there is a potential problem. Similarly, early disclosure of a shortage can help hospitals, doctors, and patients make alternative arrangements before a shortage becomes a crisis. However, drug manufacturers have not consistently provided the FDA with adequate notice of potential shortages.
<br>
<br>As part of my Administration's broader effort to work with manufacturers, health care providers, and other stakeholders to prevent drug shortages, this order directs the FDA to take steps that will help to prevent and reduce current and future disruptions in the supply of lifesaving medicines.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. Broader Reporting of Manufacturing Discontinuances. To the extent permitted by law, the FDA shall use all appropriate administrative tools, including its authority to interpret and administer the reporting requirements in 21 U.S.C. 356c, to require drug manufacturers to provide adequate advance notice of manufacturing discontinuances that could lead to shortages of drugs that are life-supporting or life-sustaining, or that prevent debilitating disease.
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. Expedited Regulatory Review. To the extent practicable, and consistent with its statutory responsibility to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the drug supply, the FDA shall take steps to expand its current efforts to expedite its regulatory reviews, including reviews of new drug suppliers, manufacturing sites, and manufacturing changes, whenever it determines that expedited review would help to avoid or mitigate existing or potential drug shortages. In prioritizing and allocating its limited resources, the FDA should consider both the severity of the shortage and the importance of the affected drug to public health.
<br>
<br>Sec. 4. Review of Certain Behaviors by Market Participants. The FDA shall communicate to the Department of Justice (DOJ) any findings that shortages have led market participants to stockpile the affected drugs or sell them at exorbitant prices. The DOJ shall then determine whether these activities are consistent with applicable law. Based on its determination, DOJ, in coordination with other State and Federal regulatory agencies as appropriate, should undertake whatever enforcement actions, if any, it deems appropriate.
<br>
<br>Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
<br>
<br>(i) authority granted by law to an agency, or the head thereof; or
<br>
<br>(ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
<br>
<br>(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
<br>
<br>(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

<br>§356d. Coordination; task force and strategic plan
<br>(a) Task force and strategic plan
<br>(1) In general
<br>(A) Task force
<br>
<br>As soon as practicable after July 9, 2012, the Secretary shall establish a task force to develop and implement a strategic plan for enhancing the Secretary's response to preventing and mitigating drug shortages.
<br>(B) Strategic plan
<br>
<br>The strategic plan described in subparagraph (A) shall include—
<br>
<br>(i) plans for enhanced interagency and intra-agency coordination, communication, and decisionmaking;
<br>
<br>(ii) plans for ensuring that drug shortages are considered when the Secretary initiates a regulatory action that could precipitate a drug shortage or exacerbate an existing drug shortage;
<br>
<br>(iii) plans for effective communication with outside stakeholders, including who the Secretary should alert about potential or actual drug shortages, how the communication should occur, and what types of information should be shared;
<br>
<br>(iv) plans for considering the impact of drug shortages on research and clinical trials; and
<br>
<br>(v) an examination of whether to establish a "qualified manufacturing partner program", as described in subparagraph (C).
<br>(C) Description of program
<br>
<br>In conducting the examination of a "qualified manufacturing partner program" under subparagraph (B)(v), the Secretary—
<br>
<br>(i) shall take into account that—
<br>
<br>(I) a "qualified manufacturer", for purposes of such program, would need to have the capability and capacity to supply products determined or anticipated to be in shortage; and
<br>
<br>(II) in examining the capability and capacity to supply products in shortage, the "qualified manufacturer" could have a site that manufactures a drug listed under section 356e of this title or have the capacity to produce drugs in response to a shortage within a rapid timeframe; and
<br>
<br>(ii) shall examine whether incentives are necessary to encourage the participation of "qualified manufacturers" in such a program.
<br>(D) Consultation
<br>
<br>In carrying out this paragraph, the task force shall ensure consultation with the appropriate offices within the Food and Drug Administration, including the Office of the Commissioner, the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, the Office of Regulatory Affairs, and employees within the Department of Health and Human Services with expertise regarding drug shortages. The Secretary shall engage external stakeholders and experts as appropriate.
<br>(2) Timing
<br>
<br>Not later than 1 year after July 9, 2012, the task force shall—
<br>
<br>(A) publish the strategic plan described in paragraph (1); and
<br>
<br>(B) submit such plan to Congress.
<br>(b) Communication
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall ensure that, prior to any enforcement action or issuance of a warning letter that the Secretary determines could reasonably be anticipated to lead to a meaningful disruption in the supply in the United States of a drug described under section 356c(a) of this title, there is communication with the appropriate office of the Food and Drug Administration with expertise regarding drug shortages regarding whether the action or letter could cause, or exacerbate, a shortage of the drug.
<br>(c) Action
<br>
<br>If the Secretary determines, after the communication described in subsection (b), that an enforcement action or a warning letter could reasonably cause or exacerbate a shortage of a drug described under section 356c(a) of this title, then the Secretary shall evaluate the risks associated with the impact of such shortage upon patients and those risks associated with the violation involved before taking such action or issuing such letter, unless there is imminent risk of serious adverse health consequences or death to humans.
<br>(d) Reporting by other entities
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall identify or establish a mechanism by which health care providers and other third-party organizations may report to the Secretary evidence of a drug shortage.
<br>(e) Review and construction
<br>
<br>No determination, finding, action, or omission of the Secretary under this section shall—
<br>
<br>(1) be subject to judicial review; or
<br>
<br>(2) be construed to establish a defense to an enforcement action by the Secretary.
<br>(f) Sunset
<br>
<br>Subsections (a), (b), (c), and (e) shall cease to be effective on the date that is 5 years after July 9, 2012.
