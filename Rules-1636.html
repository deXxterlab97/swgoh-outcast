<br>(5) Project studies excluded from peer review
<br>
<br>The Chief of Engineers may exclude a project study from peer review under paragraph (1)—
<br>
<br>(A) if the project study does not include an environmental impact statement and is a project study subject to peer review under paragraph (3)(A)(i) that the Chief of Engineers determines—
<br>
<br>(i) is not controversial;
<br>
<br>(ii) has no more than negligible adverse impacts on scarce or unique cultural, historic, or tribal resources;
<br>
<br>(iii) has no substantial adverse impacts on fish and wildlife species and their habitat prior to the implementation of mitigation measures; and

<br>
<br>(B) if the project study—
<br>
<br>(i) involves only the rehabilitation or replacement of existing hydropower turbines, lock structures, or flood control gates within the same footprint and for the same purpose as an existing water resources project;
<br>
<br>(ii) is for an activity for which there is ample experience within the Corps of Engineers and industry to treat the activity as being routine; and

<br>(6) Determination of total cost
<br>
<br>For purposes of determining the estimated total cost of a project under paragraph (3)(A), the total cost shall be based upon the reasonable estimates of the Chief of Engineers at the completion of the reconnaissance study for the project. If the reasonable estimate of total costs is subsequently determined to be in excess of the amount in paragraph (3)(A), the Chief of Engineers shall make a determination whether a project study is required to be reviewed under this section.

<br>(A) the without-project conditions are identified;
<br>
<br>(B) the array of alternatives to be considered are identified; and
<br>
<br>(C) the preferred alternative is identified.

<br>
<br>It is the sense of Congress that—
<br>
<br>(A) the Secretary and other Federal agencies with relevant jurisdiction in the environmental review process should cooperate with each other, State agencies, and Indian tribes on environmental review and project delivery activities at the earliest practicable time to avoid delays and duplication of effort later in the process, prevent potential conflicts, and ensure that planning and project development decisions reflect environmental values; and
<br>
<br>(B) the cooperation referred to in subparagraph (A) should include the development of policies and the designation of staff that advise planning agencies and project sponsors of studies or other information foreseeably required for later Federal action and early consultation with appropriate State and local agencies and Indian tribes.
<br>(2) Technical assistance
<br>
<br>If requested at any time by a State or project sponsor, the Secretary and other Federal agencies with relevant jurisdiction in the environmental review process, shall, to the maximum extent practicable and appropriate, as determined by the agencies, provide technical assistance to the State or project sponsor in carrying out early coordination activities.
<br>(3) Memorandum of agency agreement
<br>
<br>If requested at any time by a State or project sponsor, the Federal lead agency, in consultation with other Federal agencies with relevant jurisdiction in the environmental review process, may establish memoranda of agreement with the project sponsor, Indian tribe, State and local governments, and other appropriate entities to carry out the early coordination activities, including providing technical assistance in identifying potential impacts and mitigation issues in an integrated fashion.
<br>(j) Limitations
<br>
<br>Nothing in this section preempts or interferes with—
<br>
<br>(1) any obligation to comply with the provisions of any Federal law, including—

<br>
<br>(B) any other Federal environmental law;
<br>
<br>(2) the reviewability of any final Federal agency action in a court of the United States or in the court of any State;
<br>
<br>(3) any requirement for seeking, considering, or responding to public comment; or
<br>
<br>(4) any power, jurisdiction, responsibility, duty, or authority that a Federal, State, or local governmental agency, Indian tribe, or project sponsor has with respect to carrying out a project or any other provision of law applicable to projects.
<br>(k) Timing of claims
<br>(1) Timing
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a claim arising under Federal law seeking judicial review of a permit, license, or other approval issued by a Federal agency for a project study shall be barred unless the claim is filed not later than 3 years after publication of a notice in the Federal Register announcing that the permit, license, or other approval is final pursuant to the law under which the agency action is taken, unless a shorter time is specified in the Federal law that allows judicial review.
<br>(B) Applicability
<br>
<br>Nothing in this subsection creates a right to judicial review or places any limit on filing a claim that a person has violated the terms of a permit, license, or other approval.

<br>
<br>The preparation of a supplemental environmental impact statement or other environmental document, if required under this section, shall be considered a separate final agency action and the deadline for filing a claim for judicial review of the action shall be 3 years after the date of publication of a notice in the Federal Register announcing the action relating to such supplemental environmental impact statement or other environmental document.
<br>(l) Categorical exclusions
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Not later than 180 days after June 10, 2014, the Secretary shall—
