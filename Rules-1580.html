<br>
<br>"(b) A unit of general local government may not receive a payment for land for which payment under this chapter otherwise may be received if the land was owned or administered by a State or unit and was exempt from real estate taxes when the land was conveyed to the United States Government. This subsection does not apply to payments for land a State or unit acquires from a private party to donate to the Government within 8 years of acquisition, nor does this subsection apply to payments for lands in Utah acquired by the United States if at the time of such acquisition units, under applicable State law, were entitled to receive payments from the State for such lands, but in such case no payment under this chapter with respect to such acquired lands shall exceed the payment that would have been made under State law if such lands had not been acquired.
<br>
<br>"(c) A unit of general local government receiving payment for a fiscal year for land under the Act of August 28, 1937 (43 U.S.C. 1181a et seq.), or the Act of May 24, 1939 (ch. 144, 53 Stat. 753), may not receive a payment under this chapter for the land for that fiscal year. This chapter does not apply to either Act.
<br>
<br>"(d) If the total payment to a unit of general local government for a fiscal year would be less than $100, the Secretary may not make the payment."
<br>
<br>1993—Subsec. (b). Pub.

L. 94–565, see 31 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.], or regulations pursuant thereto."
<br>§6904. Additional payments
<br>
<br>(a) In addition to payments the Secretary of the Interior makes under section 6902 of this title, the Secretary shall make a payment for each fiscal year to a unit of general local government collecting and distributing real property taxes (including a unit in Alaska outside the boundaries of an organized borough) in which is located an interest in land that—
<br>
<br>(1) the United States Government acquires for—
<br>
<br>(A) the National Park System; or
<br>
<br>(B) the National Forest Wilderness Areas; and
<br>
<br>(2) was subject to local real property taxes within the 5-year period before the interest is acquired.
<br>
<br>(b) The Secretary shall make payments only for the 5 fiscal years after the fiscal year in which the interest in land is acquired. Under guidelines the Secretary prescribes, the unit of general local government receiving the payment from the Secretary shall distribute payments proportionally to units and school districts that lost real property taxes because of the acquisition of the interest. A unit receiving a distribution may use a payment for any governmental purpose.
<br>
<br>(c) Each yearly payment by the Secretary under this section is equal to one percent of the fair market value of the interest in land on the date the Government acquires the interest. However, a payment may not be more than the amount of real property taxes levied on the property during the last fiscal year before the fiscal year in which the interest is acquired. A decision on fair market value under this section may not include an increase in the value of an interest because the land is rezoned when the rezoning causes the increase after the date of enactment of a law authorizing the acquisition of an interest under subsection (a) of this section.
<br>
<br>(d) The Secretary may prescribe regulations under which payments may be made to units of general local government when subsections (a) and (b) of this section will not carry out the purpose of subsections (a) and (b).

<br>
<br>(b)(1) In addition to payments the Secretary makes under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall make a payment for each fiscal year to each unit of general local government in which is located an interest in land—

<br>(B) acquired in the Lake Tahoe Basin under the Act of December 23, 1980 (Public Law 96–586, 94 Stat. 3383).

<br>
<br>(3) The unit of general local government may use the payment for any governmental purpose.

<br>

<br>
<br>(1) financial administration of the project (including accounting, reporting and auditing, and maintaining a separate bank account), to the extent consistent with section 7108 of this title;
<br>

<br>
<br>(d) Records of a recipient related to an amount received from a joint management fund shall be made available to the head of the executive agency responsible for administering the fund and the Comptroller General for inspection and audit.
<br>
<br>(e) For a project subject to a joint management fund, one non-Government share may be established conforming to—
<br>
<br>(1) the proportional shares applicable to the assistance programs involved; and
<br>
<br>(2) the proportional shares of an amount transferred to the project account from each of the programs.

<br>
<br>(2) when necessary to promote expeditious processing of applications or effective and efficient administration of the project; and
