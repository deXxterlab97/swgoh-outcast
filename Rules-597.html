<br>§1706. Effective date of statements of record and amendments thereto
<br>(a) Thirtieth day after filing or such earlier date as determined by Director; consolidation of subsequent statement with earlier recording
<br>
<br>Except as hereinafter provided, the effective date of a statement of record, or any amendment thereto, shall be the thirtieth day after the filing thereof or such earlier date as the Director may determine, having due regard to the public interest and the protection of purchasers. If any amendment to any such statement is filed prior to the effective date of the statement, the statement shall be deemed to have been filed when such amendment was filed; except that such an amendment filed with the consent of the Director, or filed pursuant to an order of the Director, shall be treated as being filed as of the date of the filing of the statement of record. When a developer records additional lands to be offered for disposition, he may consolidate the subsequent statement of record with any earlier recording offering subdivided land for disposition under the same promotional plan. At the time of consolidation the developer shall include in the consolidated statement of record any material changes in the information contained in the earlier statement.
<br>(b) Incomplete or inaccurate statements of record
<br>
<br>If it appears to the Director that a statement of record, or any amendment thereto, is on its face incomplete or inaccurate in any material respect, the Director shall so advise the developer within a reasonable time after the filing of the statement or the amendment, but prior to the date the statement or amendment would otherwise be effective. Such notification shall serve to suspend the effective date of the statement or the amendment until thirty days after the developer files such additional information as the Director shall require. Any developer, upon receipt of such notice, may request a hearing, and such hearing shall be held within twenty days of receipt of such request by the Director.
<br>(c) Amendment of statement of record
<br>
<br>If, at any time subsequent to the effective date of a statement of record, a change shall occur affecting any material fact required to be contained in the statement, the developer shall promptly file an amendment thereto. Upon receipt of any such amendment, the Director may, if he determines such action to be necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of purchasers, suspend the statement of record until the amendment becomes effective.
<br>(d) Suspension of statement of record containing untrue statement or omission to state material fact; notice and hearing; termination of order of suspension
<br>
<br>If it appears to the Director at any time that a statement of record, which is in effect, includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, the Director may, after notice, and after opportunity for hearing (at a time fixed by the Director) within fifteen days after such notice, issue an order suspending the statement of record. When such statement has been amended in accordance with such order, the Director shall so declare and thereupon the order shall cease to be effective.
<br>(e) Examination to determine issuance of order; access to records; order suspending statement of record upon failure to cooperate
<br>
<br>The Director is hereby empowered to make an examination in any case to determine whether an order should issue under subsection (d). In making such examination, the Director or anyone designated by him shall have access to and may demand the production of any books and papers of, and may administer oaths and affirmations to and examine, the developer, any agents or any other person, in respect of any matter relevant to the examination. If the developer or any agents shall fail to cooperate, or shall obstruct or refuse to permit the making of an examination, such conduct shall be proper ground for the issuance of an order suspending the statement of record.
<br>(f) Service of notices
<br>
<br>Any notice required under this section shall be sent to or served on the developer or his authorized agent.

<br>
<br>(B) that the State's administration of such laws and regulations provides, to the maximum extent practicable, that such information is accurate.
<br>
<br>(2) In the case of any State which is not certified under paragraph (1), such State shall be certified if the Director determines—
<br>
<br>(A) that, when taken as a whole, the laws and regulations of the State applicable to the sale or lease of lots not exempt under section 1702 of this title provide sufficient protection for purchasers and lessees with respect to the matters for which information is required to be disclosed by section 1707 of this title but which is not required to be disclosed by such State's laws and regulations; and
<br>
<br>(B) that the State's administration of such laws and regulations provides, to the maximum extent practicable, that (i) information required to be disclosed by such laws and regulations is accurate, and (ii) sufficient protection for purchasers and lessees is made available with respect to the matters for which information is not required to be disclosed.
<br>
<br>(3) Any State requesting certification must agree to accept a property report covering land located in another certified State but offered for sale or lease in the State requesting certification if the property report has been approved by the other certified State. Such property report shall be the only property report required by the State with respect to the sale or lease of such land.
<br>(b) Filing of State disclosure materials and related documentation for purposes of Federal statement of record and property report requirements; acceptance by Director
<br>
<br>After the Director has certified a State under subsection (a), the Director shall accept for filing under sections 1704 through 1707 of this title (and declare effective as the Federal statement of record and property report which shall be used in all States in which the lots are offered for sale or lease) disclosure materials found acceptable, and any related documentation required, by State authorities in connection with the sale or lease of lots located within the State. The Director may accept for such filing, and declare effective as the Federal statement of record and property report, such materials and documentation found acceptable by the State in connection with the sale or lease of lots located outside that State. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the Director from exercising the authority conferred by subsections (d) and (e) of section 1706 of this title.
<br>(c) Notice to State upon failure to meet requirements and remedial action necessary for certification
<br>
<br>If a State fails to meet the standards for certification pursuant to subsection (a), the Director shall notify the State in writing of the changes in State law, regulation, or administration that are needed in order to obtain certification.
<br>(d) Periodic review of certified States' laws, regulations, and administration; withdrawal of certification
<br>
<br>The Director shall periodically review the laws and regulations, and the administration thereof, of States certified under subsection (a), and may withdraw such certification upon a determination that such laws, regulations, and the administration thereof, taken as a whole, no longer meet the requirements of subsection (a).
<br>(e) State and local governmental authorities affected; cooperation with State authorities
<br>
<br>Nothing in this chapter may be construed to prevent or limit the authority of any State or local government to enact and enforce with regard to the sale of land any law, ordinance, or code not in conflict with this chapter. In administering this chapter, the Director shall cooperate with State authorities charged with the responsibility of regulating the sale or lease of lots which are subject to this chapter.

The penalty shall be in addition to any other available civil remedy or any available criminal penalty, and may be imposed whether or not the Director imposes other administrative sanctions.

<br>
<br>The Director shall establish standards and procedures governing the imposition of civil money penalties under subsection (a). The standards and procedures—

<br>(2) Final orders
<br>
<br>If no hearing is requested within 15 days of receipt of the notice of opportunity for hearing, the imposition of the penalty shall constitute a final and unappealable determination. If the Director reviews the determination or order, the Director may affirm, modify, or reverse that determination or order. If the Director does not review the determination or order within 90 days of the issuance of the determination or order, the determination or order shall be final.
<br>(3) Factors in determining amount of penalty
<br>
<br>In determining the amount of a penalty under subsection (a), consideration shall be given to such factors as the gravity of the offense, any history of prior offenses (including offenses occurring before December 15, 1989), ability to pay the penalty, injury to the public, benefits received, deterrence of future violations, and such other factors as the Director may determine in regulations to be appropriate.
<br>(4) Reviewability of imposition of penalty
<br>
<br>The Secretary's 1 determination or order imposing a penalty under subsection (a) shall not be subject to review, except as provided in subsection (c).
<br>(c) Judicial review of agency determination
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>After exhausting all administrative remedies established by the Director under subsection (b)(1), a person aggrieved by a final order of the Director assessing a penalty under this section may seek judicial review pursuant to section 1710 of this title.
<br>(2) Order to pay penalty
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in any such review, the court shall have the power to order payment of the penalty imposed by the Director.
<br>(d) Action to collect penalty
<br>
<br>If any person fails to comply with the determination or order of the Director imposing a civil money penalty under subsection (a), after the determination or order is no longer subject to review as provided by subsections (b) and (c), the Director may request the Attorney General of the United States to bring an action in any appropriate United States district court to obtain a monetary judgment against the person and such other relief as may be available. The monetary judgment may, in the discretion of the court, include any attorneys fees and other expenses incurred by the United States in connection with the action. In an action under this subsection, the validity and appropriateness of the Secretary's 1 determination or order imposing the penalty shall not be subject to review.
<br>(e) Settlement by Director
<br>
<br>The Director may compromise, modify, or remit any civil money penalty which may be, or has been, imposed under this section.
<br>(f) "Knowingly" defined
<br>
<br>The term "knowingly" means having actual knowledge of or acting with deliberate ignorance of or reckless disregard for the prohibitions under this section.
<br>(g) Regulations
<br>
<br>The Director shall issue such regulations as the Director deems appropriate to implement this section.
<br>(h) Use of penalties for administration
<br>
<br>Civil money penalties collected under this section shall be paid to the Director and, upon approval in an appropriation Act, may be used by the Director to cover all or part of the cost of rendering services under this chapter.

Prior to granting such approval, the Attorney General shall determine that not more than one of the newspaper publications involved in the arrangement is a publication other than a failing newspaper, and that approval of such arrangement would effectuate the policy and purpose of this chapter.
<br>(c) Predatory practices not exempt
<br>
<br>Nothing contained in the chapter shall be construed to exempt from any antitrust law any predatory pricing, any predatory practice, or any other conduct in the otherwise lawful operations of a joint newspaper operating arrangement which would be unlawful under any antitrust law if engaged in by a single entity. Except as provided in this chapter, no joint newspaper operating arrangement or any party thereto shall be exempt from any antitrust law.

<br>§1804. Reinstatement of joint operating arrangements previously adjudged unlawful under antitrust laws
<br>
<br>(a) Notwithstanding any final judgment rendered in any action brought by the United States under which a joint operating arrangement has been held to be unlawful under any antitrust law, any party to such final judgment may reinstitute said joint newspaper operating arrangement to the extent permissible under section 1803(a) of this title.
<br>
<br>(b) The provisions of section 1803 of this title shall apply to the determination of any civil or criminal action pending in any district court of the United State 1 on July 24, 1970, in which it is alleged that any such joint operating agreement is unlawful under any antitrust law.

<br>§1822. Congressional statement of findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds and declares that—
<br>
<br>(1) the soring of horses is cruel and inhumane;
<br>
<br>(2) horses shown or exhibited which are sore, where such soreness improves the performance of such horse, compete unfairly with horses which are not sore;
<br>
<br>(3) the movement, showing, exhibition, or sale of sore horses in intrastate commerce adversely affects and burdens interstate and foreign commerce;
<br>
<br>(4) all horses which are subject to regulation under this chapter are either in interstate or foreign commerce or substantially affect such commerce; and
<br>
<br>(5) regulation under this chapter by the Secretary is appropriate to prevent and eliminate burdens upon commerce and to effectively regulate commerce.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 91–540, §3, Dec. 9, 1970, 84 Stat. 1405; Pub. L. 94–360, §4, July 13, 1976, 90 Stat. 915.)
<br>Amendments
<br>
<br>1976—Pub. L. 94–360, among other changes, inserted findings stating that all horses subject to regulation under this chapter are either in interstate or foreign commerce or substantially affect interstate or foreign commerce, and that regulation by the Secretary is appropriate to eliminate burdens upon commerce.
<br>§1823. Horse shows and exhibitions
<br>(a) Disqualification of horses
<br>
<br>The management of any horse show or horse exhibition shall disqualify any horse from being shown or exhibited (1) which is sore or (2) if the management has been notified by a person appointed in accordance with regulations under subsection (c) or by the Secretary that the horse is sore.
<br>(b) Prohibited activities
<br>
<br>The management of any horse sale or auction shall prohibit the sale or auction or exhibition for the purpose of sale of any horse (1) which is sore or (2) if the management has been notified by a person appointed in accordance with regulations under subsection (c) or by the Secretary that the horse is sore.
<br>(c) Appointment of inspectors; manner of inspections
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall prescribe by regulation requirements for the appointment by the management of any horse show, horse exhibition, or horse sale or auction of persons qualified to detect and diagnose a horse which is sore or to otherwise inspect horses for the purposes of enforcing this chapter. Such requirements shall prohibit the appointment of persons who, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, have been disqualified by the Secretary to make such detection, diagnosis, or inspection. Appointment of a person in accordance with the requirements prescribed under this subsection shall not be construed as authorizing such person to conduct inspections in a manner other than that prescribed for inspections by the Secretary (or the Secretary's representative) under subsection (e).
<br>(d) Recordkeeping and reporting requirements; availability of records
<br>
<br>The management of a horse show, horse exhibition, or horse sale or auction shall establish and maintain such records, make such reports, and provide such information as the Secretary may by regulation reasonably require for the purposes of implementing this chapter or to determine compliance with this chapter. Upon request of an officer or employee duly designated by the Secretary, such management shall permit entry at all reasonable times for the inspection and copying (on or off the premises) of records required to be maintained under this subsection.
<br>(e) Inspection by Secretary or duly appointed representative
<br>
<br>For purposes of enforcement of this chapter (including any regulation promulgated under this chapter) the Secretary, or any representative of the Secretary duly designated by the Secretary, may inspect any horse show, horse exhibition, or horse sale or auction or any horse at any such show, exhibition, sale, or auction. Such an inspection may only be made upon presenting appropriate credentials. Each such inspection shall be commenced and completed with reasonable promptness and shall be conducted within reasonable limits and in a reasonable manner. An inspection under this subsection shall extend to all things (including records) bearing on whether the requirements of this chapter have been complied with.

No penalty shall be assessed unless such person is given notice and opportunity for a hearing before the Secretary with respect to such violation. The amount of such civil penalty shall be assessed by the Secretary by written order. In determining the amount of such penalty, the Secretary shall take into account all factors relevant to such determination, including the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the prohibited conduct and, with respect to the person found to have engaged in such conduct, the degree of culpability, any history of prior offenses, ability to pay, effect on ability to continue to do business, and such other matters as justice may require.
<br>
<br>(2) Any person against whom a violation is found and a civil penalty assessed under paragraph (1) of this subsection may obtain review in the court of appeals of the United States for the circuit in which such person resides or has his place of business or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit by filing a notice of appeal in such court within 30 days from the date of such order and by simultaneously sending a copy of such notice by certified mail to the Secretary.

In such action, the validity and appropriateness of the final order imposing the civil penalty shall not be subject to review.
<br>
<br>(4) The Secretary may, in his discretion, compromise, modify, or remit, with or without conditions, any civil penalty assessed under this subsection.
<br>(c) Disqualification of offenders; orders; civil penalties applicable; enforcement procedures

Any person who knowingly fails to obey an order of disqualification shall be subject to a civil penalty of not more than $3,000 for each violation. Any horse show, horse exhibition, or horse sale or auction, or the management thereof, collectively and severally, which knowingly allows any person who is under an order of disqualification to show or exhibit any horse, to enter for the purpose of showing or exhibiting any horse, to take part in managing or judging, or otherwise to participate in any horse show, horse exhibition, or horse sale or auction in violation of an order shall be subject to a civil penalty of not more than $3,000 for each violation.

<br>
<br>(2) The attendance of witnesses, and the production of books, papers, and documents, may be required at any designated place from any place in the United States. In case of disobedience to a subpena the Secretary, or any party to a proceeding before the Secretary, may invoke the aid of any appropriate district court of the United States in requiring attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of such books, papers, and documents under the provisions of this chapter.
<br>
<br>(3) The Secretary may order testimony to be taken by deposition under oath in any proceeding or investigation pending before him, at any stage of the proceeding or investigation.

The Secretary may also require the production of books, papers, and documents at the taking of depositions.
<br>
<br>(4) Witnesses whose depositions are taken and the persons taking them shall be entitled to the same fees as paid for like services in the courts of the United States or in other jurisdictions in which they may appear.
<br>
<br>(5) In any civil or criminal action to enforce this chapter or any regulation under this chapter a horse shall be presumed to be a horse which is sore if it manifests abnormal sensitivity or inflammation in both of its forelimbs or both of its hindlimbs.
<br>
<br>(6) The United States district courts, the District Court of Guam, the District Court of the Virgin Islands, the highest court of American Samoa, and the United States courts of the other territories, are vested with jurisdiction specifically to enforce, and to prevent and restrain violations of this chapter, and shall have jurisdiction in all other kinds of cases arising under this chapter, except as provided in subsection (b) of this section.

<br>
<br>(1) The Secretary may detain (for a period not to exceed twenty-four hours) for examination, testing, or the taking of evidence, any horse at any horse show, horse exhibition, or horse sale or auction which is sore or which the Secretary has probable cause to believe is sore. The Secretary may require the temporary marking of any horse during the period of its detention for the purpose of identifying the horse as detained. A horse which is detained subject to this paragraph shall not be moved by any person from the place it is so detained except as authorized by the Secretary or until the expiration of the detention period applicable to the horse.
<br>
<br>(2) Any equipment, device, paraphernalia, or substance which was used in violation of any provision of this chapter or any regulation issued under this chapter or which contributed to the soring of any horse at or prior to any horse show, horse exhibition, or horse sale or auction, shall be liable to be proceeded against, by process of libel for the seizure and condemnation of such equipment, device, paraphernalia, or substance, in any United States district court within the jurisdiction of which such equipment, device, paraphernalia, or substance is found. Such proceedings shall conform as nearly as possible to proceedings in rem in admiralty.

<br>Subsecs. (c) to (e). Pub. L. 94–360 added subsecs. (c) to (e).
<br>§1826. Notice of violations to Attorney General

<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 91–540, §7, Dec. 9, 1970, 84 Stat. 1406.)

<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 91–540, §9, Dec. 9, 1970, 84 Stat. 1406.)
<br>§1829. Preemption of State laws; concurrent jurisdiction; prohibition on certain State action

<br>No provision of this chapter shall be construed as indicating an intent on the part of the Congress to occupy the field in which such provision operates to the exclusion of the law of any State on the same subject matter, unless there is a direct and positive conflict between such provision and the law of the State so that the two cannot be reconciled or consistently stand together. Nor shall any provision of this chapter be construed to exclude the Federal Government from enforcing the provision of this chapter within any State, whether or not such State has enacted legislation on the same subject, it being the intent of the Congress to establish concurrent jurisdiction with the States over such subject matter.

<br>
<br>"Sec. 101. Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program. (a) Short Title.—This chapter may be cited as the 'Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Act of 1999'.
<br>
<br>"(b) Congressional Findings.—Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>"(1) the United States steel industry has been severely harmed by a record surge of more than 40,000,000 tons of steel imports into the United States since 1998, caused by the world financial crisis;
<br>
<br>"(2) this surge in imports resulted in the loss of more than 10,000 steel worker jobs since 1998, and was the imminent cause of three bankruptcies by medium-sized steel companies, Acme Steel, Laclede Steel, and Geneva Steel;
<br>
<br>"(3) the crisis also forced almost all United States steel companies into—
<br>
<br>"(A) reduced volume, lower prices, and financial losses; and
<br>
<br>"(B) an inability to obtain credit for continued operations and reinvestment in facilities;
<br>
<br>"(4) the crisis also has affected the willingness of private banks and investment institutions to make loans to the United States steel industry for continued operation and reinvestment in facilities;
<br>
<br>"(5) these steel bankruptcies, job losses, and financial losses are also having serious negative effects on the tax base of cities, counties, and States, and on the essential health, education, and municipal services that these government entities provide to their citizens; and
<br>
<br>"(6) a strong steel industry is necessary to the adequate defense preparedness of the United States in order to have sufficient steel available to build the ships, tanks, planes, and armaments necessary for the national defense.
<br>

<br>
<br>"(1) Board.—The term 'Board' means the Loan Guarantee Board established under subsection (e).

<br>"CHAPTER 2
<br>
<br>"Sec. 201. Petroleum Development Management. (a) Short Title.—This chapter may be cited as the 'Emergency Oil and Gas Guaranteed Loan Program Act'.
<br>
<br>"(b) Findings.—Congress finds that—

<br>"(2) the number of oil and gas rigs operating in the United States is at its lowest since 1944, when records of this tally began;
<br>
<br>"(3) if prices do not increase soon, the United States could lose at least half its marginal wells, which in aggregate produce as much oil as the United States imports from Saudi Arabia;
<br>
<br>"(4) oil and gas prices are unlikely to increase for at least several years;
<br>
<br>"(5) declining production, well abandonment, and greatly reduced exploration and development are shrinking the domestic oil and gas industry;
<br>
<br>"(6) the world's richest oil producing regions in the Middle East are experiencing increasingly greater political instability;
<br>
<br>"(7) United Nations policy may make Iraq the swing oil producing nation, thereby granting Saddam Hussein tremendous power;
<br>
<br>"(8) reliance on foreign oil for more than 60 percent of our daily oil and gas consumption is a national security threat;
<br>
<br>"(9) the level of United States oil security is directly related to the level of domestic production of oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas; and
<br>
<br>"(10) a national security policy should be developed that ensures that adequate supplies of oil are available at all times free of the threat of embargo or other foreign hostile acts.
