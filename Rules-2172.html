<br>
<br>(C) An incentives clause in a contract under this section shall specify the target incentive ranges of costs for completion of destruction operations and facility closure activities, respectively, as jointly agreed upon by the contracting officer and the contractor concerned. An incentives clause shall require a proportionate reduction in the maximum incentive payment amounts in the event that the contractor exceeds an agreed-upon target cost if such excess costs are the responsibility of the contractor.
<br>
<br>(D) The amount of the incentive payment earned by a contractor for a chemical demilitarization facility under an incentives clause under this subsection shall be based upon a determination by the Secretary on how early in the target incentive range specified in such clause destruction operations or facility closure activities, as the case may be, are completed.
<br>
<br>(E) The provisions of any incentives clause under this subsection shall be consistent with the obligation of the Secretary of Defense under subsection (d)(1)(A), to provide for maximum protection for the environment, the general public, and the personnel who are involved in the destruction of the lethal chemical agents and munitions.

<br>
<br>"(a) Findings.—Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>"(1) The Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction, done at Paris on January 13, 1993 (commonly referred to as the 'Chemical Weapons Convention'), requires that destruction of the entire United States chemical weapons stockpile be completed by not later than April 29, 2007.
<br>
<br>"(2) In 2006, under the terms of the Chemical Weapons Convention, the United States requested and received a one-time, 5-year extension of its chemical weapons destruction deadline to April 29, 2012.
<br>
<br>"(3) On April 10, 2006, the Secretary of Defense notified Congress that the United States would not meet even the extended deadline under the Chemical Weapons Convention for destruction of the United States chemical weapons stockpile, but would 'continue working diligently to minimize the time to complete destruction without sacrificing safety and security' and would also 'continue requesting resources needed to complete destruction as close to April 2012 as practicable'.
<br>
<br>"(4) The United States chemical demilitarization program has met its one percent, 20 percent, and extended 45 percent destruction deadlines under the Chemical Weapons Convention.
<br>
<br>"(5) Destroying the remaining stockpile of United States chemical weapons is imperative for public safety and homeland security, and doing so by April 2012, in accordance with the current destruction deadline provided under the Chemical Weapons Convention, is required by United States law.
<br>
<br>"(6) The elimination of chemical weapons anywhere they exist in the world, and the prevention of their proliferation, is of utmost importance to the national security of the United States.
<br>
<br>"(7) Section 921(b)(3) of the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 (Public Law 109–364; 120 Stat. 2359) contained a sense of Congress urging the Secretary of Defense to ensure the elimination of the United States chemical weapons stockpile in the shortest time possible, consistent with the requirement to protect public health, safety, and the environment.
<br>
<br>"(8) Section 921(b)(4) of that Act contained a sense of Congress urging the Secretary of Defense to propose a credible treatment and disposal process with the support of affected communities. In this regard, any such process should provide for sufficient communication and consultation between representatives of the Department of Defense and representatives of affected States and communities.
<br>
<br>"(b) Sense of Congress.—It is the sense of Congress that—
<br>
<br>"(1) the United States is, and must remain, committed to making every effort to safely dispose of its entire chemical weapons stockpile by April 2012, the current destruction deadline provided under the Chemical Weapons Convention, or as soon thereafter as possible, and must carry out all of its other obligations under the Convention; and
<br>
<br>"(2) the Secretary of Defense should make every effort to plan for, and to request in the annual budget of the President submitted to Congress adequate funding to complete, the elimination of the United States chemical weapons stockpile in accordance with United States obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention and in a manner that will protect public health, safety, and the environment, as required by law.

<br>
<br>"(1) To provide for adequate protection of personnel from any exposure to a chemical warfare agent (including chronic and low-level exposure to a chemical warfare agent) that would endanger the health of exposed personnel because of the deleterious effects of—
<br>
<br>"(A) a single exposure to the agent;
<br>
<br>"(B) exposure to the agent concurrently with other dangerous exposures, such as exposures to—
<br>
<br>"(i) other potentially toxic substances in the environment, including pesticides, other insect and vermin control agents, and environmental pollutants;
<br>
<br>"(ii) low-grade nuclear and electromagnetic radiation present in the environment;
<br>
<br>"(iii) preventive medications (that are dangerous when taken concurrently with other dangerous exposures referred to in this paragraph);
<br>
<br>"(iv) diesel fuel, jet fuel, and other hydrocarbon-based fuels; and
<br>
<br>"(v) occupational hazards, including battlefield hazards; and
<br>
<br>"(C) repeated exposures to the agent, or some combination of one or more exposures to the agent and other dangerous exposures referred to in subparagraph (B), over time.
<br>
<br>"(2) To provide for—
<br>
<br>"(A) the prevention of and protection against, and the detection (including confirmation) of, exposures to a chemical warfare agent (whether intentional or inadvertent) at levels that, even if not sufficient to endanger health immediately, are greater than the level that is recognized under Department of Defense policies as being the maximum safe level of exposure to that agent for the general population; and
<br>
<br>"(B) the recording, reporting, coordinating, and retaining of information on possible exposures described in subparagraph (A), including the monitoring of the health effects of exposures on humans and animals, environmental effects, and ecological effects, and the documenting and reporting of those effects specifically by location.
<br>
<br>"(3) To provide solutions for the concerns and mission requirements that are specifically applicable for one or more of the Armed Forces in a protracted conflict when exposures to chemical agents could be complex, dynamic, and occurring over an extended period.
<br>
<br>"(c) Research Program.—The Secretary of Defense shall develop and carry out a plan to establish a research program for determining the effects of exposures to chemical warfare agents of the type described in subsection (b). The research shall be designed to yield results that can guide the Secretary in the evolution of policy and doctrine on exposures to chemical warfare agents and to develop new risk assessment methods and instruments with respect to such exposures. The plan shall state the objectives and scope of the program and include a 5-year funding plan.
<br>
<br>"(d) Report.—Not later than May 1, 1999, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the Committee on National Security of the House of Representatives [now Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives] a report on the results of the review under subsection (a) and on the research program developed under subsection (c). The report shall include the following:
<br>
<br>"(1) Each modification of chemical warfare defense policy and doctrine resulting from the review.
<br>
<br>"(2) Any recommended legislation regarding chemical warfare defense.

<br>
<br>"(C) Sense of congress.—It is the sense of Congress that the facility considered under subparagraph (A) shall, if established—
<br>
<br>"(i) be under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Defense; and
<br>
<br>"(ii) be located at a principal facility of the Department of Defense for the testing and evaluation of the use of chemical and biological weapons during any period of armed conflict."
