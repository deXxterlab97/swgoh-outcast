<br>
<br>(A) The development, implementation, and assessment of technical training and public education programs, including education programs that address unique characteristics of distant and near-field tsunami.
<br>
<br>(B) The development of decision support tools.
<br>
<br>(C) The incorporation of social science research into community readiness and resilience efforts.
<br>
<br>(D) The development of evidence-based education guidelines.
<br>
<br>(8) Dissemination of guidelines and standards for community planning, education, and training products, programs, and tools, including—
<br>
<br>(A) standards for—
<br>
<br>(i) mapping products;
<br>
<br>(ii) inundation models; and
<br>
<br>(iii) effective emergency exercises; and
<br>
<br>(B) recommended guidance for at-risk port and harbor tsunami warning, evacuation, and response procedures in coordination with the Coast Guard and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
<br>(d) Authorized activities
<br>
<br>In addition to activities conducted under subsection (c), the program conducted under subsection (a) may include the following:
<br>
<br>(1) Multidisciplinary vulnerability assessment research, education, and training to help integrate risk management and resilience objectives with community development planning and policies.
<br>
<br>(2) Risk management training for local officials and community organizations to enhance understanding and preparedness.
<br>
<br>(3) In coordination with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, interagency, Federal, State, tribal, and territorial intergovernmental tsunami response exercise planning and implementation in high risk areas.

<br>
<br>(6) Risk notification systems that coordinate with and build upon existing systems and actively engage decisionmakers, State, local, tribal, and territorial governments and agencies, business communities, nongovernmental organizations, and the media.
<br>(e) No preemption with respect to designation of at-risk areas
<br>
<br>The establishment of national standards for inundation models under this section shall not prevent States, territories, tribes, and local governments from designating additional areas as being at risk based on knowledge of local conditions.
<br>(f) No new regulatory authority
<br>
<br>Nothing in this chapter may be construed as establishing new regulatory authority for any Federal agency.
