<br>§631. Declaration of policy
<br>(a) Aid, counsel, assistance, etc., to small business concerns
<br>
<br>The essence of the American economic system of private enterprise is free competition. Only through full and free competition can free markets, free entry into business, and opportunities for the expression and growth of personal initiative and individual judgment be assured. The preservation and expansion of such competition is basic not only to the economic well-being but to the security of this Nation. Such security and well-being cannot be realized unless the actual and potential capacity of small business is encouraged and developed. It is the declared policy of the Congress that the Government should aid, counsel, assist, and protect, insofar as is possible, the interests of small-business concerns in order to preserve free competitive enterprise, to insure that a fair proportion of the total purchases and contracts or subcontracts for property and services for the Government (including but not limited to contracts or subcontracts for maintenance, repair, and construction) be placed with small-business enterprises, to insure that a fair proportion of the total sales of Government property be made to such enterprises, and to maintain and strengthen the overall economy of the Nation.
<br>(b) Assistance to compete in international markets
<br>
<br>(1) It is the declared policy of the Congress that the Federal Government, through the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, acting through the Associate Administrator for International Trade, and in cooperation with the Department of Commerce and other relevant State and Federal agencies, should aid and assist small businesses, as defined under this chapter, to increase their ability to compete in international markets by—
<br>
<br>(A) enhancing their ability to export;
<br>
<br>(B) facilitating technology transfers;
<br>
<br>(C) enhancing their ability to compete effectively and efficiently against imports;
<br>
<br>(D) increasing the access of small businesses to long-term capital for the purchase of new plant and equipment used in the production of goods and services involved in international trade;
<br>
<br>(E) disseminating information concerning State, Federal, and private programs and initiatives to enhance the ability of small businesses to compete in international markets; and
<br>
<br>(F) ensuring that the interests of small businesses are adequately represented in bilateral and multilateral trade negotiations.
<br>
<br>(2) The Congress recognizes that the Department of Commerce is the principal Federal agency for trade development and export promotion and that the Department of Commerce and the Small Business Administration work together to advance joint interests. It is the purpose of this chapter to enhance, not alter, their respective roles.
<br>(c) Aid for agriculturally related industries; financial assistance
<br>
<br>It is the declared policy of the Congress that the Government, through the Small Business Administration, should aid and assist small business concerns which are engaged in the production of food and fiber, ranching, and raising of livestock, aquaculture, and all other farming and agricultural related industries; and the financial assistance programs authorized by this chapter are also to be used to assist such concerns.
<br>(d) Use of assistance programs to establish, preserve, and strengthen small business concerns
<br>
<br>(1) The assistance programs authorized by sections 636(i) and 636(j) of this title are to be utilized to assist in the establishment, preservation, and strengthening of small business concerns and improve the managerial skills employed in such enterprises, with special attention to small business concerns (1) located in urban or rural areas with high proportions of unemployed or low-income individuals; or (2) owned by low-income individuals; and to mobilize for these objectives private as well as public managerial skills and resources.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) With respect to the programs authorized by section 636(j) of this title, the Congress finds—
<br>
<br>(i) that ownership and control of productive capital is concentrated in the economy of the United States and certain groups, therefore, own and control little productive capital;
<br>
<br>(ii) that certain groups in the United States own and control little productive capital because they have limited opportunities for small business ownership;
<br>
<br>(iii) that the broadening of small business ownership among groups that presently own and control little productive capital is essential to provide for the well-being of this Nation by promoting their increased participation in the free enterprise system of the United States;
<br>
<br>(iv) that such development of business ownership among groups that presently own and control little productive capital will be greatly facilitated through the creation of a small business ownership development program, which shall provide services, including, but not limited to, financial, management, and technical assistance.1
<br>
<br>(v) that the power to let Federal contracts pursuant to section 637(a) of this title can be an effective procurement assistance tool for development of business ownership among groups that own and control little productive capital; and
<br>
<br>(vi) that the procurement authority under section 637(a) of this title shall be used only as a tool for developing business ownership among groups that own and control little productive capital.
<br>
<br>(B) It is therefore the purpose of the programs authorized by section 636(j) of this title to—
<br>
<br>(i) foster business ownership and development by individuals in groups that own and control little productive capital; and
<br>
<br>(ii) promote the competitive viability of such firms in the marketplace by creating a small business and capital ownership development program to provide such available financial, technical, and management assistance as may be necessary.
<br>(e) Assistance to victims of floods, etc., and those displaced as result of federally aided construction programs
<br>
<br>Further, it is the declared policy of the Congress that the Government should aid and assist victims of floods and other catastrophes, and small-business concerns which are displaced as a result of federally aided construction programs.
<br>(f) Findings; purpose
<br>
<br>(1) with 2 respect to the Administration's business development programs the Congress finds—
<br>
<br>(A) that the opportunity for full participation in our free enterprise system by socially and economically disadvantaged persons is essential if we are to obtain social and economic equality for such persons and improve the functioning of our national economy;
<br>
<br>(B) that many such persons are socially disadvantaged because of their identification as members of certain groups that have suffered the effects of discriminatory practices or similar invidious circumstances over which they have no control;
<br>
<br>(C) that such groups include, but are not limited to, Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, Indian tribes, Asian Pacific Americans, Native Hawaiian Organizations, and other minorities;
<br>
<br>(D) that it is in the national interest to expeditiously ameliorate the conditions of socially and economically disadvantaged groups;
<br>
<br>(E) that such conditions can be improved by providing the maximum practicable opportunity for the development of small business concerns owned by members of socially and economically disadvantaged groups;
<br>
<br>(F) that such development can be materially advanced through the procurement by the United States of articles, equipment, supplies, services, materials, and construction work from such concerns; and
<br>
<br>(G) that such procurements also benefit the United States by encouraging the expansion of suppliers for such procurements, thereby encouraging competition among such suppliers and promoting economy in such procurements.
<br>
<br>(2) It is therefore the purpose of section 637(a) of this title to—
<br>
<br>(A) promote the business development of small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals so that such concerns can compete on an equal basis in the American economy;
<br>
<br>(B) promote the competitive viability of such concerns in the marketplace by providing such available contract, financial, technical, and mangement 3 assistance as may be necessary; and
<br>
<br>(C) clarify and expand the program for the procurement by the United States of articles, supplies, services, materials, and construction work from small business concerns owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.
<br>(g) Assistance to disaster victims under disaster loan program
<br>
<br>In administering the disaster loan program authorized by section 636 of this title, to the maximum extent possible, the Administration shall provide assistance and counseling to disaster victims in filing applications, providing information relevant to loan processing, and in loan closing and prompt disbursement of loan proceeds and shall give the disaster program a high priority in allocating funds for administrative expenses.
<br>(h) Assistance to women owned business
<br>
<br>(1) With respect to the programs and activities authorized by this chapter, the Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(A) women owned business has become a major contributor to the American economy by providing goods and services, revenues, and jobs;
<br>
<br>(B) over the past two decades there have been substantial gains in the social and economic status of women as they have sought economic equality and independence;
<br>
<br>(C) despite such progress, women, as a group, are subjected to discrimination in entrepreneurial endeavors due to their gender;
<br>
<br>(D) such discrimination takes many overt and subtle forms adversely impacting the ability to raise or secure capital, to acquire managerial talents, and to capture market opportunities;
<br>
<br>(E) it is in the national interest to expeditiously remove discriminatory barriers to the creation and development of small business concerns owned and controlled by women;
<br>
<br>(F) the removal of such barriers is essential to provide a fair opportunity for full participation in the free enterprise system by women and to further increase the economic vitality of the Nation;
<br>
<br>(G) increased numbers of small business concerns owned and controlled by women will directly benefit the United States Government by expanding the potential number of suppliers of goods and services to the Government; and
<br>
<br>(H) programs and activities designed to assist small business concerns owned and controlled by women must be implemented in such a way as to remove such discriminatory barriers while not adversely affecting the rights of socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.
<br>
<br>(2) It is, therefore, the purpose of those programs and activities conducted under the authority of this chapter that assist women entrepreneurs to—
<br>
<br>(A) vigorously promote the legitimate interests of small business concerns owned and controlled by women;
<br>
<br>(B) remove, insofar as possible, the discriminatory barriers that are encountered by women in accessing capital and other factors of production; and
<br>
<br>(C) require that the Government engage in a systematic and sustained effort to identify, define and analyze those discriminatory barriers facing women and that such effort directly involve the participation of women business owners in the public/private sector partnership.
<br>(i) Prohibition on use of funds for individuals not lawfully within United States
<br>
<br>None of the funds made available pursuant to this chapter may be used to provide any direct benefit or assistance to any individual in the United States if the Administrator or the official to which the funds are made available receives notification that the individual is not lawfully within the United States.
<br>(j) Contract bundling
<br>
<br>In complying with the statement of congressional policy expressed in subsection (a), relating to fostering the participation of small business concerns in the contracting opportunities of the Government, each Federal agency, to the maximum extent practicable, shall—
<br>
<br>(1) comply with congressional intent to foster the participation of small business concerns as prime contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers;
<br>
<br>(2) structure its contracting requirements to facilitate competition by and among small business concerns, taking all reasonable steps to eliminate obstacles to their participation; and
<br>
<br>(3) avoid unnecessary and unjustified bundling of contract requirements that precludes small business participation in procurements as prime contractors.

<br>
<br>The opportunity for full participation in our free enterprise system by socially and economically disadvantaged persons is essential if we are to obtain social and economic justice for such persons and improve the functioning of our national economy.
<br>
<br>The Office of Minority Business Enterprise, established in 1969, greatly facilitated the strengthening and expansion of our minority enterprise program. In order to take full advantage of resources and opportunities in the minority enterprise field, we now must build on this foundation. One important way of improving our efforts is by clarifying the authority of the Secretary of Commerce (a) to implement Federal policy in support of the minority business enterprise program; (b) provide additional technical and management assistance to disadvantaged business; (c) to assist in demonstration projects; and (d) to coordinate the participation of all Federal departments and agencies in an increased minority enterprise effort.
<br>
<br>NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me as President of the United States, it is ordered as follows:
<br>
<br>Section 1. Functions of the Secretary of Commerce. (a) The Secretary of Commerce (hereinafter referred to as "the Secretary") shall—

<br>
<br>(b) The Secretary, as he deems necessary or appropriate to enable him to better fulfill the responsibilities vested in him by subsection (a), may—
<br>
<br>(1) With the participation of other Federal departments and agencies as appropriate, develop comprehensive plans and specific program goals for the minority enterprise program; establish regular performance monitoring and reporting systems to assure that goals are being achieved; and evaluate the impact of Federal support in achieving the objectives established by this order.
<br>
<br>(2) Require a coordinated review of all proposed Federal training and technical assistance activities in direct support of the minority enterprise program to assure consistency with program goals and to avoid duplication.
<br>
<br>(3) Convene, for purposes of coordination, meetings of the heads of such departments and agencies, or their designees, whose programs and activities may affect or contribute to the purposes of this order.
<br>
<br>(4) Convene business leaders, educators, and other representatives of the private sector who are engaged in assisting the development of minority business enterprise or who could contribute to its development, for the purpose of proposing, evaluating and coordinating governmental and private activities in furtherance of the objectives of this order.
<br>
<br>(5) Confer with and advise officials of State and local governments.
<br>
<br>(6) Provide the managerial and organizational framework through which joint or collaborative undertakings with Federal departments or agencies or private organizations can be planned and implemented.

<br>
<br>Ex. Ord. No. 12432, July 14, 1983, 48 F.R. 32551, provided:
<br>
<br>By virtue of the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America, including Section 205(a) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 486(a)) [now 40 U.S.C. 121(a)], in order to provide guidance and oversight for programs for the development of minority business enterprise pursuant to my statement of December 17, 1982 concerning Minority Business Development; and to implement the commitment of the Federal government to the goal of encouraging greater economic opportunity for minority entrepreneurs, it is hereby ordered as follows:
<br>
<br>Section 1. Minority Business Development Plans.

Such agencies shall submit these plans to the Cabinet Council on Commerce and Trade on an annual basis.
<br>
<br>(b) These annual plans shall establish minority enterprise development objectives for the participating agencies and methods for encouraging both prime contractors and grantees to utilize minority business enterprises.

<br>Ex. Ord. No. 12928. Promoting Procurement With Small Businesses Owned and Controlled by Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Individuals, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Minority Institutions
<br>
<br>Ex. Ord. No. 12928, Sept. 16, 1994, 59 F.R. 48377, provided:
<br>
<br>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, in order to enforce rigorously the letter and spirit of public laws that promote increased participation in Federal procurement by Small Businesses Owned and Controlled by Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Individuals (SDBs) as described in section 8 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637), Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) as described in 34 C.F.R. 608.2, and Minority Institutions (MIs) as referred to in sections 1046(3) and 316(b)(1) of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (20 U.S.C. 1135d-5(3) and 1059c(b)(1), respectively), it is hereby ordered as follows:
<br>
<br>Section 1. Policy Statement. It is the policy of the United States Government that all department and agency heads and all Federal employees involved in the procurement of any and all goods and services shall assist SDBs, HBCUs, and MIs, as applicable, to develop viable, self-sustaining businesses capable of competing on an equal basis in the mainstream of the American economy. To that end, all Federal personnel shall commit to the letter and spirit of all laws promoting the participation of SDBs, HBCUs, and MIs in Federal procurement. The laws promote:
<br>
<br>(a) the award of contracts to SDBs, HBCUs, and MIs through the Small Business Administration Section 8(a) [15 U.S.C. 637(a)] Program, the Department of Defense Small and Disadvantaged Business Program, other agency programs, and through other specific statutory authority or appropriate means;
<br>
<br>(b) the establishment of particular goals for SDBs, HBCUs, or MIs on an agency-by-agency basis and the requirement that prime contractors and other recipients of Federal funds attain similar goals in their procurement; and
<br>
<br>(c) the establishment of other mechanisms that ensure that SDBs, HBCUs, and MIs have a fair opportunity to participate in Federal procurement.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. Attainment of Goals. All departments and agencies are required by law to establish participation goals of not less than 5 percent (15 U.S.C. 644(g)) or a greater percentage where otherwise required by law, as further provided in the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Letter No. 91–1 of March 11, 1991. Although the Federal Government has made substantial strides toward meeting established SDB, HBCU, and MI participation goals, certain departments and agencies have from time to time failed to aggressively pursue such goals. Department and agency heads are henceforth directed to execute, implement, and otherwise aggressively strive to fulfill the statutorily-mandated procurement participation goals. In addition, all departments and agencies are encouraged to set reasonable participation goals that exceed statutory requirements, to the extent permitted by law.
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. Subcontracting Plans. The Small Business Act, (15 U.S.C. 637(d)) and other related laws require certain prime contractors to maximize the use of SDBs in subcontracting plans and strive to achieve stated goals through prime contractors' subcontracting practices. Department and agency heads are directed to aggressively enforce these prime contractors' obligations to maximize awards of subcontracts to eligible SDBs.
<br>
<br>Sec. 4. Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization ("OSDBU").
<br>
<br>(a) Section 15(k) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 644(k)) establishes in each Federal department and agency an OSDBU and requires that the Director of the OSDBU "be responsible only to, and report directly to, the head of such agency or to the deputy of such head" (15 U.S.C. 644(k)(3)). To the extent not prohibited by law, each department and agency shall ensure that the aforementioned direct reporting requirements are henceforth vigorously enforced.
<br>
<br>(b) Because of the importance of the OSDBU function, each department and agency shall also, to the extent not prohibited by law, comply with the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Letter No. 79–1 of March 7, 1979, which provides implementation guidance on section 15k [15(k)] and the organizational placement and functions of the OSDBU.
<br>
<br>Sec. 5. Anti-fraud Enforcement. All department and agency heads shall ensure that in enforcing the laws and requirements mentioned in this order, Federal benefits or contracts intended for SDBs, HBCUs, and MIs are not awarded to entities that are not legitimate SDBs, HBCUs, and MIs. Department and agency anti-fraud enforcement, however, shall not diminish agency vigor in achieving the aforementioned participation goals, which exist to promote the development of legitimate SDBs, HBCUs, and MIs. Nothing herein is intended to change self-certification requirements.
<br>
<br>Sec. 6. Periodic Reports to the President. The Administrator of the Small Business Administration and the Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy shall report to the President periodically on the progress of all departments and agencies in complying with the laws and requirements mentioned in this order.
<br>
<br>Sec. 7. Independent Agencies. Independent agencies are requested to comply with the provisions of this order.
<br>
<br>Sec. 8. This order shall be effective immediately.

<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13169. Assistance to Small Business Exporters and Dislocated Workers
<br>
<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13169, Oct. 6, 2000, 65 F.R. 60581, provided:
<br>
<br>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 631 et seq., the Workforce Investment Act, [former] 29 U.S.C. 2801 et seq., and the Trade Act of 1974, 19 U.S.C. 2271 et seq. [19 U.S.C. 2101 et seq.], and in order to assist small businesses, including businesses headed by underserved populations, in participating in the export of products, and to expedite the delivery of adjustment assistance to dislocated workers, it is hereby ordered as follows:
<br>
<br>Section 1. Policy. By its accession to the World Trade Organization, the People's Republic of China will be required to open its markets to a wide range of products and services provided by Americans. In addition, the United States has recently enacted a new law to facilitate trade with the countries of Sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean Basin. Federal agencies should take steps to assist small businesses, including businesses headed by underserved populations, in capitalizing on these new opportunities. The agencies should also take steps to assist workers who lose their jobs as a result of competition from imports in their efforts to secure adjustment assistance benefits for which they are eligible.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. Interagency Task Force on Small Business Exports. (a) The Secretaries of Commerce and Labor, the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, the United States Trade Representative, and the Chairman of the Export-Import Bank shall, within 60 days from the date of this order, establish an interagency task force through the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC). The task force shall facilitate exports by United States small businesses, including businesses headed by underserved populations, particularly with respect to the People's Republic of China and the countries of Sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean Basin. The TPCC shall submit an annual report to the President on the functions carried out by this task force during the preceding year. As part of its work, the task force shall assess the extent to which the establishment of permanent normal trade relations with the People's Republic of China, and the United States enactment of the African Growth and Opportunity Act, 19 U.S.C.A. 3701 et seq., and the United States-Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act, 19 U.S.C.A. 2701 note, may contribute to the creation of export opportunities for small businesses including businesses headed by underserved populations.
<br>
<br>(b) For the purposes of this order, "businesses headed by underserved populations" means businesses headed by women or minorities, and/or located in rural communities.
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. Expedited Response to Worker Dislocation. (a) The Secretary of Labor shall expedite the Federal response to worker dislocation through the Workforce Investment Act and the Trade Adjustment Assistance program by proactively seeking information, from a variety of sources, on actual or prospective layoffs, including the media and community and labor union members, and by sharing such information with appropriate state workforce officials. In addition, the Department of Labor (Labor) shall undertake a number of proactive steps to support public outreach activities aimed at workers, employers, the media, local officials, the community, and labor organizations and their members to improve awareness of the adjustment assistance available through Labor programs, including, but not limited to:
<br>
<br>(1) developing a set of methods to inform employers of the services available through Labor workforce programs, which will explain the requirements of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. 2101 et seq., and provide information on worker adjustment programs, including the Trade Adjustment Assistance and the basic dislocated worker programs, emphasizing the importance of early intervention to minimize the affects of work layoffs;
<br>
<br>(2) improving websites and other modes of communication to provide basic information on dislocated worker and Trade Adjustment Assistance program contacts at the State and local level;
<br>
<br>(3) developing a National Toll-Free Help Line to provide universal, accurate, and easy access to information about public workforce services to workers and employers;
<br>
<br>(4) providing on-site technical assistance, in partnership with other Federal agencies, when there are layoffs or closures with multi-State impact, or when there are dislocations with significant community impact (such as areas that have been affected by numerous layoffs of apparel and textile workers);
<br>
<br>(5) informing States directly when a secondary worker impact has been affirmed by Labor; and
<br>
<br>(6) to the extent permitted by law, and subject to the availability of appropriations, providing funding or an outreach campaign for secondary workers (i.e., individuals indirectly affected by increased imports from other countries).
<br>
<br>(b) The Secretary of Labor, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative, shall report annually on the employment effects of the establishment of permanent normal trade relations with the People's Republic of China.
<br>
<br>Sec. 4. Judicial Review. This order does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party against the United States, its officers, its employees, or any other person.

<br>
<br>Section 1. Policy. America honors the extraordinary service rendered to the United States by veterans with disabilities incurred or aggravated in the line of duty during active service with the armed forces. Heads of agencies shall provide the opportunity for service-disabled veteran businesses to significantly increase the Federal contracting and subcontracting of such businesses.

<br>
<br>Sec. 2. Duties of Agency Heads. To implement the policy set forth in section 1, heads of agencies shall:
<br>
<br>(a) develop a strategy to implement the policy set forth in section 1;
<br>
<br>(b) make the agency's strategy publicly available and report annually to the Administrator of the Small Business Administration on implementation of the agency's strategy;
<br>
<br>(c) designate a senior-level official who shall be responsible for developing and implementing the agency's strategy;
