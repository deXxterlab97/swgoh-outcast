<br>§579d–2. Deauthorization of inactive projects
<br>(a) Purposes
<br>
<br>The purposes of this section are—
<br>
<br>(1) to identify water resources development projects authorized by Congress that are no longer viable for construction due to—
<br>
<br>(A) a lack of local support;
<br>
<br>(B) a lack of available Federal or non-Federal resources; or
<br>
<br>(C) an authorizing purpose that is no longer relevant or feasible;
<br>
<br>(2) to create an expedited and definitive process for Congress to deauthorize water resources development projects that are no longer viable for construction; and
<br>
<br>(3) to allow the continued authorization of water resources development projects that are viable for construction.
<br>(b) Proposed deauthorization list
<br>(1) Preliminary list of projects
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall develop a preliminary list of each water resources development project, or separable element of a project, authorized for construction before November 8, 2007, for which—
<br>
<br>(i) planning, design, or construction was not initiated before December 27, 2020; or
<br>
<br>(ii) planning, design, or construction was initiated before December 27, 2020, but for which no funds, Federal or non-Federal, were obligated for planning, design, or construction of the project or separable element of the project during the current fiscal year or any of the 10 preceding fiscal years.
<br>(B) Use of comprehensive construction backlog and operation and maintenance report
<br>
<br>The Secretary may develop the preliminary list from the comprehensive construction backlog and operation and maintenance reports developed pursuant to section 1001(b)(2) of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 (33 U.S.C. 579a [(b)(2)]).
<br>(C) Exclusions
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall not include on the preliminary list—
<br>
<br>(i) an environmental infrastructure assistance project authorized to be carried out by the Secretary (including a project authorized pursuant to an environmental assistance program); or

<br>(2) Preparation of proposed deauthorization list
<br>(A) Deauthorization amount
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall prepare a proposed list of projects for deauthorization comprised of a subset of projects and separable elements identified on the preliminary list developed under paragraph (1) that have, in the aggregate, an estimated Federal cost to complete that is at least $10,000,000,000.
<br>(B) Determination of Federal cost to complete
<br>
<br>For purposes of subparagraph (A), the Federal cost to complete shall take into account any allowances authorized by section 2280 of this title, as applied to the most recent project schedule and cost estimate.
<br>(C) Inclusion of deauthorization of antiquated projects
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall reduce the amount identified for deauthorization under paragraph (2)(A) by an amount equivalent to the estimated current value of each project, or separable element of a project, that is deauthorized by subsection (f).
<br>(3) Sequencing of projects
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall identify projects and separable elements for inclusion on the proposed list of projects for deauthorization under paragraph (2) according to the order in which the projects and separable elements were authorized, beginning with the earliest authorized projects and separable elements and ending with the latest project or separable element necessary to meet the aggregate amount under paragraph (2)(A).
<br>(B) Factors to consider
<br>
<br>The Secretary may identify projects and separable elements in an order other than that established by subparagraph (A) if the Secretary determines, on a case-by-case basis, that a project or separable element is critical for interests of the United States, based on the possible impact of the project or separable element on public health and safety, the national economy, or the environment.
<br>(4) Public comment and consultation
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall solicit comments from the public and the Governors of each applicable State on the proposed deauthorization list prepared under paragraph (2)(A).
<br>(B) Comment period
<br>
<br>The public comment period shall be 90 days.

<br>
<br>(ii) revising the proposed deauthorization list prepared under paragraph (2)(A) as the Secretary determines necessary to respond to such comments.
<br>(B) Appendix
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall include as part of the final deauthorization list an appendix that—

<br>(i) identifies each project or separable element on the proposed deauthorization list that is not included on the final deauthorization list; and
<br>
<br>(ii) describes the reasons why the project or separable element is not included on the final deauthorization list.
<br>(c) Submission of final deauthorization list to Congress for congressional review; publication
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Not later than 90 days after the date of the close of the comment period under subsection (b)(4), the Secretary shall—

<br>The Secretary shall not include in the final deauthorization list submitted under paragraph (1) any project or separable element with respect to which Federal funds for planning, design, or construction are obligated after the development of the preliminary list under subsection (b)(1)(A) but prior to the submission of the final deauthorization list under paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection.
<br>(d) Deauthorization; congressional review
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>After the expiration of the 2-year period beginning on the date of publication of the final deauthorization list and appendix under subsection (c)(1)(B), a project or separable element of a project identified in the final deauthorization list is hereby deauthorized, unless Congress passes a joint resolution disapproving the final deauthorization list prior to the end of such period.
<br>(2) Non-Federal contributions
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>A project or separable element of a project identified in the final deauthorization list under subsection (c) shall not be deauthorized under this subsection if, before the expiration of the 2-year period referred to in paragraph (1), the non-Federal interest for the project or separable element of the project provides sufficient funds to complete the project or separable element of the project.
<br>(B) Treatment of projects
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), each project and separable element of a project identified in the final deauthorization list shall be treated as deauthorized for purposes of the aggregate deauthorization amount specified in subsection (b)(2)(A).

<br>
<br>A project or separable element of a project may not be identified on the proposed deauthorization list developed under subsection (b), or the final deauthorization list developed under subsection (c), if the project or separable element received funding for a post-authorization study during the current fiscal year or any of the 10 preceding fiscal years.
<br>(2) Treatment of project modifications
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, if an authorized water resources development project or separable element of the project has been modified by an Act of Congress, the date of the authorization of the project or separable element shall be deemed to be the date of the most recent such modification.
<br>(f) Deauthorization of antiquated projects
<br>(1) In general
