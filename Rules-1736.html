<br>[The citations to section 232(d) of existing title 37, above, are to the language of subsection (d) set forth in the codification note under section 232, rather than that erroneously set forth in the text of the section.]
<br>
<br>In subsection (a), the last 27 words are substituted for the words "or performance of the duties provided for by sections 5, 81, 94, 97 and 99 of the National Defense Act, as amended," to reflect the current citations. So much of the introductory clause as follows the exception is substituted for the 36 words preceding 1st proviso of 1st sentence of section 232(d) of existing title 37. The words "on the active list" are omitted as covered by the words "active duty" as defined in section 101(18) of this revised title. The words "(provided for or authorized in the National Defense Act, as amended, or in the Naval Reserve Act of 1938, as amended)" are omitted as covered by the words "provided by law".
<br>
<br>In subsection (b), the words "For the purposes of subsection (a)" are inserted for clarity. The words "active duty for a period of more than 30 days" are substituted for the words "extended active duty in excess of thirty days". The words "call or" are inserted to conform to the words "called or".
<br>
<br>In subsection (c), the words "and allowances" are omitted, since, under chapter 7 of this revised title, entitlement to allowances depends upon entitlement to basic pay. The last sentence is substituted for the last 38 words of the 2d proviso of the 1st sentence of section 232(d) of existing title 37.
<br>
<br>In subsection (d), the words "for the purposes of this section" are substituted for the words "and which entitles them to receive basic pay . . . in the service of the United States". The words "pursuant to this section" are omitted as surplusage.
<br>
<br>In subsection (e), the words "or active duty for training" are omitted as covered by the words "active duty" as defined in section 101(18) of this revised title.
<br>
<br>In subsection (f), the words "is appointed" are substituted for the words "has been or may be commissioned". The words "under the laws appointing such graduates to the Army" and the last 16 words of section 308a of existing title 37 are omitted as surplusage. The words "to the date of his acceptance of and qualification under his commission" are omitted, since the member concerned would continue to be entitled to basic pay after that acceptance and qualification. The words "or the United States Naval Academy" are inserted to reflect section 541 of title 10, under which graduates of that Academy may be appointed in the Army or the Air Force.
<br>
<br>In subsection (i), the inclusion of the Coast Guard Reserve is based on the authority contained in section 755(c) of title 14.

<br>
<br>In subsection (a), the introductory clause is substituted for section 233(a) (introductory clause) of existing title 37. In clauses (1) and (2), the word "officer" is substituted for the words "commissioned officer, commissioned warrant officer, warrant officer" to conform to the definition of "officer" in section 101(11) of this revised title. In clause (1), the words "Regular or Reserve component" are omitted, since, under the definition of "reserve component" in section 102(k) of the source statute, those words are defined to include members without component status. Together, these categories compose the entire structure of any uniformed service. In clause (2)(F), the words "a reserve component of a uniformed service" are substituted for the words "the National Guard of the United States, or in the Organized Reserve Corps, or in the Officers' Reserve Corps, or in the Enlisted Reserve Corps, or in the Medical Reserve Corps, or in the Medical Reserve Corps of the Navy, or in the Dental Reserve Corps of the Navy . . . or in the Naval Reserve . . . or in the Air National Guard of the United States, or in the Air Force Reserve, or in the officers' section of the Air Force Reserve, or in the enlisted section of the Air Force Reserve, or in the Air Corps Reserve . . . or in the Marine Corps Reserve, or in the Coast Guard Reserve, or in the Reserve Corps of the Public Health Service," since all of the named organizations were or are reserve components. In clause (4), the words "as it existed at any time before April 16, 1947" are inserted for clarity, since the reference is intended to apply to the corps established by law before April 16, 1947. Service in the Army Nurse Corps or Navy Nurse Corps now existing would be included under clause (1) or (2), since there is now no legal distinction between the service of nurses and that of other members of the Army and Navy. In clause (6), the date "January 1, 1961," is substituted for the words "the effective date of this section," to reflect laws enacted after that effective date which authorized certain service to be credited for pay purposes. See, for example, Public Law 86–142. Clause (9) is substituted for section 233(b) (less proviso) of existing title 37. The last sentence is substituted for section 233(b) (proviso) of existing title 37.
<br>
<br>In subsection (b), the first 33 words of section 233(d) of existing title 37 are omitted as covered by the words "are computed by adding" in subsection (a). The words "for any reason," in section 233(d) of existing title 37, are omitted as surplusage.
<br>
<br>In subsection (c)(3), the words "chapter 67 of title 10" are substituted for the words "title III of the Army and Air Force Vitalization and Retirement Equalization Act of 1948," since that title was repealed by section 53 of the Act of August 10, 1956, ch. 1041 (70A Stat. 641), and is now codified as chapter 67 of title 10 by section 1 of that Act.

<br>
<br>(1) for each regular period of instruction, or period of appropriate duty, at which the member is engaged for at least two hours, including that performed on a Sunday or holiday;
<br>
<br>(2) for the performance of such other equivalent training, instruction, duty, or appropriate duties, as the Secretary may prescribe;
<br>
<br>(3) for a regular period of instruction that the member is scheduled to perform but is unable to perform because of physical disability resulting from an injury, illness, or disease incurred or aggravated—
<br>
<br>(A) in line of duty while performing—
<br>
<br>(i) active duty; or
<br>
<br>(ii) inactive-duty training;
<br>
<br>(B) while traveling directly to or from that duty or training (unless such injury, illness, disease, or aggravation of an injury, illness, or disease is the result of the gross negligence or misconduct of the member); or

<br>(C) in line of duty while remaining overnight immediately before the commencement of inactive-duty training, or while remaining overnight, between successive periods of inactive-duty training, at or in the vicinity of the site of the inactive-duty training; or
<br>
<br>(4) for each of six days for each period during which the member is on maternity leave.
<br>
<br>(b) The regulations prescribed under subsection (a) for each uniformed service, the National Guard, and each of the classes of organization of the reserve components within each uniformed service, may be different. The Secretary concerned shall, for the National Guard and each of the classes of organization within each uniformed service, prescribe—
<br>
<br>(1) minimum standards that must be met before an assembly for drill or other equivalent period of training, instruction, duty, or appropriate duties may be credited for pay purposes, and those standards may require the presence for duty of officers and enlisted members in numbers equal to or more than a minimum number or percentage of the unit strength for a specified period of time with participation in a prescribed kind of training;

<br>(2) the maximum number of assemblies or periods of other equivalent training, instruction, duty, or appropriate duties, that may be counted for pay purposes in each fiscal year or in lesser periods of time; and
<br>
<br>(3) the minimum number of assemblies or periods of other equivalent training, instruction, duty, or appropriate duties that must be completed in stated periods of time before the members of units or organizations can qualify for pay.
<br>
<br>(c) A person enlisted in the inactive National Guard is not entitled to pay under this section.
<br>

<br>
<br>(2) A member of the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve may be paid compensation under this section at a rate and under terms determined by the Secretary of Defense, but not to exceed the rate otherwise applicable to the member under subsection (a), upon the member's successful completion of a course of instruction undertaken by the member using electronic-based distributed learning methodologies to accomplish training requirements related to unit readiness or mobilization, as directed for the member by the Secretary concerned. The compensation may be paid regardless of whether the course of instruction was under the direct control of the Secretary concerned or included the presence of an instructor.

<br>
<br>(B) any claim based on that work or study arising after that date.
<br>
<br>(e) A member of the National Guard or of a reserve component of the uniformed services may not be paid under this section for more than four periods of equivalent training, instruction, duty, or appropriate duties performed during a fiscal year instead of the member's regular period of instruction or regular period of appropriate duty during that fiscal year.

The words "member of a reserve component of a uniformed service" are substituted for the words "National Guard of the United States, Air National Guard of the United States, Organized Reserve Corps, Naval Reserve, Air Force Reserve, Marine Corps Reserve, Coast Guard Reserve, and the Reserve Corps of the Public Health Service," since all of those organizations, or their successors, are the reserve components of the uniformed services. The words "who is not entitled to basic pay under section 204 of this title" are substituted for section 301(e) as (applicable to basic pay) of existing title 37. The words "of a corresponding grade" are inserted for clarity.
<br>
<br>In subsection (b), the words "National Guard or reserve components" are substituted for the listing of organizations for the reasons set forth above.
