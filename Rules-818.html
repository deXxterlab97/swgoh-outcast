<br>§492. Forfeiture of counterfeit paraphernalia
<br>
<br>All counterfeits of any coins or obligations or other securities of the United States or of any foreign government, or any articles, devices, and other things made, possessed, or used in violation of this chapter or of sections 331–333, 335, 336, 642 or 1720, of this title, or any material or apparatus used or fitted or intended to be used, in the making of such counterfeits, articles, devices or things, found in the possession of any person without authority from the Secretary of the Treasury or other proper officer, shall be forfeited to the United States.
<br>
<br>Whoever, having the custody or control of any such counterfeits, material, apparatus, articles, devices, or other things, fails or refuses to surrender possession thereof upon request by any authorized agent of the Treasury Department, or other proper officer, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.
<br>
<br>Whenever, except as hereinafter in this section provided, any person interested in any article, device, or other thing, or material or apparatus seized under this section files with the Secretary of the Treasury, before the disposition thereof, a petition for the remission or mitigation of such forfeiture, the Secretary of the Treasury, if he finds that such forfeiture was incurred without willful negligence or without any intention on the part of the petitioner to violate the law, or finds the existence of such mitigating circumstances as to justify the remission or the mitigation of such forfeiture, may remit or mitigate the same upon such terms and conditions as he deems reasonable and just.
<br>
<br>If the seizure involves offenses other than offenses against the coinage, currency, obligations or securities of the United States or any foreign government, the petition for the remission or mitigation of forfeiture shall be referred to the Attorney General, who may remit or mitigate the forfeiture upon such terms as he deems reasonable and just.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §286 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §172, 35 Stat. 1121; Jan. 27, 1938, ch. 10, §4, 52 Stat. 7).
<br>
<br>Section was materially shortened through merger of former third and fourth sentences with present first and second paragraphs by extending latter to include "articles, devices, and other things". This necessitated many insertions and deletions in the first two paragraphs, which, however, did not affect the substance of the section.
<br>
<br>A reference in the former third sentence to violations of certain sections was broadened to read "in violation of this chapter or of sections 331–333, 335–336, 642, 1720, of this title" and incorporated in the first paragraph. This translation extends for the first time the provisions of this section to subject matter of sections 493–496, 498, 499, 504–509 of this title. All of the sections covered by the original reference in this section are represented in the translation except section 261, now section 8 of this title, and section 287 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which were omitted therefrom as unnecessary, since the former is definitive and the latter related to procedure only, and is superseded by rule 41(a), (b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.
<br>
<br>The revised section was so written as to limit the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to forfeitures within the enforcement powers of the Treasury Department, which advises that it does not investigate counterfeiting offenses not involving coins, currency, or Government obligations and securities. The Attorney General is the appropriate officer to remit or mitigate other forfeitures.
<br>
<br>Changes in phraseology were also made.

<br>
<br>Each of the nine sections from which this section was derived contained similar provisions with respect to one or more named agencies or corporations. The punishment was the same in each section except that in sections 982, 1126, and 1316 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, the maximum fine was $5,000. This section adopts the $10,000 maximum fine provided in the other six former sections.

<br>This section condenses and simplifies the form of the former sections without change of substance, except where the maximum fine differs as noted above.
<br>
<br>The enumeration of "note, bond, debenture, coupon, obligation, instrument, or writing" does not occur in any one of the original sections but is an adequate enumeration of the instruments mentioned in each.
<br>
<br>Certain specific agencies are enumerated by name as are "land bank, intermediate credit bank, bank for cooperatives," but the phrase "or any lending, mortgage, insurance, credit, or savings and loan corporation or association" was used to embrace the following: National Farm Loan Association, Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, Federal Savings and Loan Associations, National Agricultural Credit Corporation, Production Credit Corporations, Production Credit Associations, Home Loan Banks, National Mortgage Associations, and Central Bank for Cooperatives, Regional Agricultural Credit Corporation, or any instrumentalities created for similar purposes.
<br>
<br>Reference to persons causing, procuring, aiding or assisting was omitted as unnecessary, such persons being principals by section 2 of this title.
<br>
<br>The section was written in two paragraphs; the first denouncing forgery, counterfeiting, and altering; the second, passing, uttering, and publishing. This arrangement, together with the simplified style of the rewritten section, will permit the repeal of similar provisions in at least nine complicated sections now in title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking.
<br>
<br>Section 1138d(f) of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, was omitted from this revision and recommended for repeal. It provides as follows: "Whoever conspires with another to accomplish any of the acts made unlawful by the preceding provisions of this section shall, on conviction thereof, be subject to the same fine or imprisonment, or both, as is applicable in the case of conviction for doing such unlawful act."
<br>
<br>The only case construing such subsection (f) is United States v. Halbrook, D.C. Mo. 1941, 36 F. Supp. 345, in which the District Judge said by way of obiter dictum in a footnote that "Under this section no overt act need be shown as is true in the case of a prosecution under section 37 of the Criminal Code", now section 371 of this title.
<br>
<br>Indeed the indictment upon which Halbrook was acquitted was drawn under section 88 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., now section 371 of this title, which required allegation and proof of an overt act and provided punishment by fine of not more than $10,000, or imprisonment for not more than 2 years, or both. The second indictment charged only substantive violations and involved neither conspiracy section.
<br>
<br>It will be noted that section 1138d(f) of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, applies in terms only to the Farm Credit Administration, intermediate credit banks, Federal Farm Mortgage Corporation, and by reference to the banks for cooperatives, Production Credit Associations and Production Credit Corporations, and is not applicable to land banks, loan associations, Federal Housing Administration, Home Owners' Loan Corporation, or other institutions.
<br>
<br>It is also noted that in the only reported case involving this section, the United States attorney drew his conspiracy indictment not under section 1138d(f) of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, but under section 88 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which is now section 371 of this title, indicating considerable doubt as to the scope and effect of section 1138d(f) of said title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking.
<br>
<br>There is no sound reason for differentiating between types of credit, insurance, banking and lending agencies in the punishment of conspiracy or in the requirement as to proof of overt acts. Since conspiracies involving offenses equally serious such as obstruction of justice, bribery, embezzlements, counterfeiting and false statements and offenses against the Treasury of the United States as well as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Home Owners' Loan Corporation are punishable under the general conspiracy statute, the same rule should be applied to lesser agencies.
<br>
<br>The blanket provision for punishment of "any person who willfully violates any other provision of this Act" was omitted as useless, in view of the specific provisions for penalties elsewhere in the Act.
