<br>§5101. Purpose
<br>
<br>It is the purpose of this chapter to provide a plan for classification of positions whereby—
<br>
<br>(1) in determining the rate of basic pay which an employee will receive—
<br>
<br>(A) the principle of equal pay for substantially equal work will be followed; and
<br>
<br>(B) variations in rates of basic pay paid to different employees will be in proportion to substantial differences in the difficulty, responsibility, and qualification requirements of the work performed and to the contributions of employees to efficiency and economy in the service; and
<br>
<br>(2) individual positions will, in accordance with their duties, responsibilities, and qualification requirements, be so grouped and identified by classes and grades, as defined by section 5102 of this title, and the various classes will be so described in published standards, as provided by section 5105 of this title, that the resulting position-classification system can be used in all phases of personnel administration.

<br>The section is reorganized and restated for clarity.
<br>
<br>In subsection (a)(1)(i), the exception of "a Government controlled corporation" is added to preserve the application of this chapter to "corporations wholly owned by the United States". This is necessary as the defined term "Executive agency" includes the defined term "Government corporation" and the latter includes both Government owned and controlled corporations. Thus the exclusion of Government controlled corporations, which are distinct from wholly owned corporations, operates to preserve the application of the chapter to wholly owned corporations.
