<br>13	And the daughters of Tyre with gifts, yea, all the rich among the poeple, shall entreat thy countenance.
<br>14	All the glory of the king’s daughter is within in golden borders,
<br>15	Clothed round about with varieties. Af- ter her shall virgins be brought to the king: her neighbours shall be brought to thee.
<br>16	They shall be brought with gladness and rejoicing: they shall be brought into the temple of the king.
<br>17	Instead of thy fathers, sons are born to thee: thou shalt make them princes over all the earth.
<br>18	They shall remember thy name through- out all generations. Therefore shall people praise thee for ever; yea, for ever and ever.
<br>
<br>Chapter 45
<br>
<br>Unto the end, for the sons of Core, for the hid- den.
<br>2	Our God is our refuge and strength: a helper in troubles, which have found us exceedingly.
<br>3	Therefore we will not fear, when the earth shall be troubled; and the mountains shall be removed into the heart of the sea.
<br> 
<br>4	Their waters roared and were troubled: the mountains were troubled with his strength.
<br>5	The stream of the river maketh the city of God joyful: the most High hath sanctified his own tabernacle.
<br>6	God is in the midst thereof, it shall not be moved: God will help it in the lmorning early.
<br>7	Nations were troubled, and kingdoms were bowed down: he uttered his voice, the earth trembled.
<br>8	The Lord of armies is with us: the God of Jacob is our protector.
<br>9	Come and behold ye the works of the Lord: what wonders he hath done upon earth,
<br>10	Making wars to cease even to the end of the earth. He shall destroy the bow, and break the weapons: and the shield he shall burn in the fire.
<br>11	Be still and see that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, and I will be exalted in the earth.
<br>12	The Lord of armies is with us: the God of Jacob is our protector.
<br>
<br>Chapter 46
<br>Unto the end, for the sons of Core.
<br>2	O clap your hands, all ye nations: shout unto God with the voice of joy,
<br>3	For the Lord is high, terrible: a great king over all the earth.
<br>4	He hath subdued the people under jus; and the nations under our feet.
<br>5	He hath chosen for us his inheritance, the beauty of Jacob which he hath love.
<br>6	God is ascended with jubilee, and the Lord with the sound of trumpet.
<br>7	Sing praises to our God, sing ye: sing praises to our king, sing ye.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>8	For God is the king of all the earth: sing ye wisely.
<br>9	God shall reign over the nations: God sitteth on his holy throne.
<br>10	The princes of the people are gathered to- gether, with the God of Abraham: for the strong gods of the earth are exceedingly exalted.
<br>
<br>Chapter 47
<br>A psalm of a canticle, for the sons of Core, on the second day of the week.
<br>2	Great is the Lord, and exceedingly to be praised in the city of our God, in his holy moun- tain.
<br>3	With the joy of the whole earth is mount Sion founded, on the sides of the north, the city of the great king.
<br>4	In her houses shall God be known, when he shall protect her.
<br>5	For behold the kings of the earth assembled themselves: they gathered together.
<br>6	So they saw, and they wondered, they were troubled, they were moved:
<br>7	Trembling took hold of them. There were pains as of a woman in labour.
<br>8	With a vehement wind thou shalt break in pieces the ships of Tharsis.
<br>9	As we have heard, so have we seen, in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God: God hath founded it for ever.
<br>10	We have received thy mercy, O God, in the midst of thy temple.
<br>11	According to thy name, O God, so also is thy praise kunto the ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of justice.
<br>12	Let mount Sion rejoice, and the daughters of Juda be glad; because of thy judgments, O Lord.
<br> 
<br>13	Surround Sion, and encompass her: tell lye in her towers.
<br>14	Set your hearts on her strength; and dis- tribute her houses, that ye may relate it in an- other generation.
<br>15	For this is God, our God unto eternity, and for ever and ever: he shall rule us for evermore.
<br>
<br>Chapter 48
<br>
<br>Unto the end, a psalm for the sons of Core.
<br>2	Hear these things, all ye nations: give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world.
<br>3	All you that are earthborn, and you sons of men: both rich and poor together.
<br>4	My mouth shall speak wisdom: and the meditation of my heart understanding.
<br>5	I will incline my ear to a parable; I will open my proposition on the psaltery.
<br>6	Why shall I fear in the evil day? the iniquity of my heel shall encompass me.
<br>7	They that trust in their own strength, and glory in the multitude of their riches,
<br>8	No brother can redeem, nor shall man re- deem: he shall not give to God his ransom,
<br>9	Nor the price of the redemption of his soul: and shall labour for ever,
<br>10	And shall still live unto the end.
<br>11	He shall not see destruction, when he shall see the wise dying: the senseless and the fool shall perish together: And they shall leave their riches to strangers:
<br>12	And their sepulchres shall be their houses for ever. Their dwelling places to all generations: they have called their lands by their names.
<br>13	And man when he was in honour did not understand; he is compared to senseless beasts, and is become like to them.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>14	This way of theirs is a stumblingblock to them: and afterwards they shall delight in their mouth.
<br>15	They are laid in hell like sheep: death shall feed upon them. And the just shall have domin- ion over them in the morning; and their help shall decay in hell from their glory.
<br>16	But God will redeem my soul from the hand of hell, when he shall receive me.
<br>17	Be not thou afraid, when a man shall be made rick, and when the glory of his house shall be increased.
<br>18	For when he shall die he shall take nothing away; nor shall his glory descend with him.
<br>19	For in his lifetime his soul will be blessed: and he will praise thee when thou shalt do well to him.
<br>20	He shall g in to the gneerations of his fa- thers: and he shall never see light.
<br>21	Man when he was in honour did not un- derstand: he hath been compared to senseless beasts, and made like to them.
<br>
<br>Chapter 49
<br>A psalm for Asaph. The God of gods, the Lord hath spoken: and he hath called the earth. From the rising of the sun, to the going down thereof:
<br>2	Out of Sion the loveliness of his beauty.
<br>3	God shall come manifestly: our God shall come, and shall not keep silence. A fire shall burn before him: and a mighty tempest shall be round about him.
<br>4	He shall call heraven from above, and the earth, to judge his people.
<br>5	Gather ye together his saints to him: who set his covenant before sacrifices.
<br>6	And the heavens shall declare his justice: for God is judge.
<br> 
<br>7	Hear, O my people, and I will speak: O Israel, and I will testify to thee: I am God, thy God.
<br>8	I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices: and thy burnt offerings are always in my sight.
<br>9	I will not take calves out of thy house: nor he goats out of thy flocks.
<br>10	For all the beasts of the woods are mine: the cattle on the hills, and the oxen.
<br>11	I know all the fowls of the air: and with me is the beauty of the field.
<br>12	If I should be hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world is mine, and the fulness thereof.
<br>13	Shall I eat the flesh of bullocks? or shall I drink the blood of goats?
<br>14	Offer to God the sacrifice of praise: and pay thy vows to the most High.
<br>15	And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.
<br>16	But to the sinner God hath said: Why dost thou declare my justices, and take my covenant in thy mouth?
<br>17	Seeing thou hast hated discipline: and hast cast my words behind thee.
<br>18	If thou didst see a thief thou didst run with him: and with adulterers thou hast been a par- taker.
<br>19	Thy mouth hath abounded with evil, and thy tongue framed deceits.
<br>20	Sitting thou didst speak against thy brother, and didst lay a scandal against thy mother’s son:
<br>21	These things hast thou done, and I was silent. Thou thoughtest unjustly that I should be like to thee: but I will reprove thee, and set before thy face.
<br>22	Understand these things, you that forget God; lest he snatch you away, and there be none to deliver you.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>23	The sacrifice of praise shall glorify me: and there is the way by which I will shew him the salvation of God.
<br>
<br>Chapter 50
<br>Unto the end, a psalm of David,
<br>2 When Nathan the prophet came to him, af- ter he had sinned with Bethsabee. [2 Kings 12.] 3 Have mercy on me, O God, according to thy great mercy. And according to the multitude of
<br>thy tender mercies blot out my iniquity.
<br>4	Wash me yet more from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.
<br>5	For I know my iniquity, and my sin is always before me.
<br>6	To thee only have I sinned, and have done evil befoer thee: that thou mayst be justified in thy words, and mayst overcome when thou art judged.
<br>7	For behold I was conceived in iniquities; and in sins did my mother conceive me.
<br>8	For behold thou hast loved truth: the uncer- tain and hidden things of thy wisdom thou hast made manifest to me.
<br>9	Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be cleansed: thou shalt wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow.
<br>10	To my hearing thou shalt give joy and glad- ness: and the bones that have been humbled shall rejoice.
<br>11	Tukrn away thy face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities.
<br>12	Create a clean heart in me, O God: and renew a right spirit within my bowels.
<br>13	Cast me not away from thy face; and take not thy holy spirit from me.
<br>14	Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, and strengthen me with a perfect spirit.
<br> 
<br>15	I will teach the unjust thy ways: and the wicked shall be converted to thee.
<br>16	Deliver me from blood, O God, thou God of my salvation: and my tongue shall extol thy justice.
<br>17	O Lord, thou wilt open my lips: and my mouth shall declare thy praise.
<br>18	For if thou hadst desired sacrifice, I would indeed have given it: with burnt offerings thou wilt not be delighted.
<br>19	A sacrifice to God is an afflicted spirit: a contrite and humbled heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.
<br>20	Deal favourably, O Lord, in thy good will with Sion; that the walls of Jerusalem may be built up.
<br>21	Then shalt thou accept the sacrifice of jus- tice, oblations and whole burnt offerings: then shall they lay calves upon thy altar.
<br>
<br>Chapter 51
<br>
<br>Unto the end, understanding for David,
<br>2	When Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul: David went to the house of Achimelech.
<br>3	Why dost thou glory in malice, thou that art mighty in iniquity?
<br>4	All the day long thy tongue hath devised injustice: as a sharp razor, thou hast wrought deceit.
<br>5	Thou hast loved malice more than goodness: and iniquity rather than to speak righteousness. 6 Thou hast loved all the words of ruin, O
<br>deceitful tongue.
<br>7 Therefore will God destroy thee for ever: he will pluck thee out, and remove thee from thy dwelling place: and thy root out of the land of the living.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>8	The just shall see and fear, and shall laugh at him, and say:
<br>9	Behold the man that made not God his helper: But trusted in the abundance of his riches: and prevailed in his vanity.
<br>10	But I, as a fruitful olive tree in the house of God, have hoped in the mercy of God for ever, yea for ever and ever.
<br>11	I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done it: and I will wait on thy name, for it is good in the sight of thy saints.
<br>
<br>
<br>Chapter 52
<br>
<br>Unto the end, for Maeleth, understandings to David. The fool said in his heart: There is no God.
<br>2	They are corrupted, and become abominable in iniquities: there is none that doth good.
<br>3	God looked down from heaven on the chil- dren of men: to see if there were any that did understand, or did seek God.
<br>4	All have gone aside, they are become unprof- itable toegther, there is none that doth good, no not one.
<br>5	Shall not all the workers of iniquity know, who eat up my people as they eat bread?
<br>6	They have not called upon God: there have they trembled for fear, where there was no fear. For God hath scattered the bones of them that please men: they have been confounded, because God hath despised them.
<br>7	Who will give out of Sion the salvation of Israel? when God shall bring back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 53
<br>Unto the end, in verses, understanding for David.
<br>2	When the en of Ziph had come and said to Saul: Is not David hidden with us? [1 Kings 23.19]
<br>3	Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me in thy strength.
<br>4	O God, hear my lprayer: give ear to the words of my mouth.
<br>5	For strangers have rrisen up against me; and the mighty have sought after my soul: and they have not set God before their eyes.
<br>6	For behold God is my helper: and the Lord is the protector of my soul.
<br>7	Turn back the evils upon my enemies; and cut them off in thy truth.
<br>8	I will freely sacrifice to thee, and will give praise, O God, to thy name: because it is good: 9 For thou hast delivered me out of all trouble: and my eye hath looked down upon my enemies.
<br>
<br>Chapter 54
<br>Unto the end, in verses, understanding for David.
<br>2	Hear, O God, my prayer, and despise not lmy supplication:
<br>3	Be attentive to me and hear me. I am grieved in my exercise; and am troubled,
<br>4	At the voice of the enemy, and at the tribu- lation of the sinner. For they have cast iniquities upon me: and in wrath they were troublesome to me.
<br>5	My heart is troubled within me: and the fear of death is fallen upon me.
<br>6	Fear and trembling are come upon me: and darkness hath covered me.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>7	And I said: Who will give me wings like a dove, and I will fly and be at rest?
<br>8	Lo, I have gone far off flying away; and I abode in the wilderness.
<br>9	I waited for him that hath saved me from pusillanimity of spirit, and a storm.
<br>10	Cast down, O Lord, and divide their tongues; for I have seen iniquity and contradic- tion in the city.
<br>11	Day and night shall iniquity surround it upon its walls: and in the midst thereof are- labour,
<br>12	And injustice. And usury and deceit have not departed from its streets.
<br>13	For if my enemy had reviled me, I would verily have borne with it. And if he that hated me had spoken great things against me, I would perhaps have hidden my self from him.
<br>14	But thou a man of one mind, my guide, and my familiar,
<br>15	Who didst take sweetmeats together with me: in the house of God we walked with consent. 16 Let death come upon them, and let them go down alive into hell. For there is wickedness
<br>in their dwellings: in the midst of them.
<br>17	But I have cried to God: and the Lord will save me.
<br>18	Evening and morning, and at noon I will speak and declare: and he shall hear my voice.
<br>19	He shall redeem my soul in peace from them that draw near to me: for among many they were with me.
<br>20	God shall hear, and the Eternal shall hum- ble them. For there is no change with them, and they have not feared God:
<br>21	He hath stretched forth his hand to repay.
<br>They have defiled his covenant,
<br>22	They are divided by the wrath of his coun- tenance, and his heart hath drawn near. His
<br> 
<br>words are smoother tha oil, and the same are darts.
<br>23	Cast thy care upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee: he shall not suffer the just to waver for ever.
<br>24	But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction. Bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee, O Lord.
<br>
<br>Chapter 55
<br>Unto the end, for a people that is removed at a distance form the sanctuary: for David, for an inscription of a title (or pillar) when the Philistines held him in Geth.
<br>2	Have mercy on me, O God, for man hath trodden me under foot; all the day long he hath afflicted me fighting against me.
<br>3	My enemies have trodden on me all the day long; for they are many that make war against me.
<br>4	From the height of the day I shall fear: but I will trust in thee.
<br>5	In God I will praise my words, in God I have put my trust: I will not fear what flesh can do against me.
<br>6	All the day long they detested my words: all their thoughts were against me unto evil.
<br>7	They will dwell and hide themselves: they will watch my heel. As they have waited for my soul,
<br>8	For nothing shalt thou save them: in thy anger thou shalt break the people in pieces. O God,
<br>9	I have declared to thee my life: thou hast set me tears in thy sight, As also in thy promise. 10 Then shall my enemies be turned back. In what day soever I shall call upon thee, behold I
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>know thou art my God.
<br>11	In God will I praise the word, in the Lord will I praise his speech. In God have I hoped, I will not fear what man can do to me.
<br>12	In me, O God, are vows to thee, which I will lpay, praises to thee:
<br>13	Because thou hast delivered my soul from death, my feet from falling: that I may please in the sight of God, in the light of the living.
<br>
<br>Chapter 56
<br>Unto the end, destroy not, for David, for an in- scription of a title, when he fled from Saul into the cave. [1 Kings 24.]
<br>2	Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me: for my soul trusteth in thee. And in the shadow of thy wings will I hope, until iniquity pass away.
<br>3	I will cry to God the most high; to God who hath done good to me.
<br>4	He hath sent from heaven and delivered me: he hath made them a reproach that trod upon me. God hath sent his mercy and his truth,
<br>5	And he hath delivered my soul from the midst of the young lions. I slept troubled. The sons ofmen, whose teeth are weapons and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.
<br>6	Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens, and thy glory above all the earth.
<br>7	They prepared a snare for my feet; and they bowed down my soul. They dug a pit before my face, and they are fallen into it.
<br>8	My heart is ready, O God, my heart is ready: I will sing, and rehearse a psalm.
<br>9	Arise, O my glory, arise psaltery and harp: I will arise early.
<br>10	I will give praise to thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing a psalm to thee among the
<br> 
<br>nations.
<br>11	For thy mercy is magnified even to the heavens: and thy truth unto the clouds.
<br>12	Be thou exalted,  O God,  above the heav- ens: and thy glory above all the earth.
<br>
<br>Chapter 57
<br>Unto the end, destroy not, for David, for an in- scription of a title.
<br>2	If in very deed ye speak justice: judge right things, ye sons of men.
<br>3	For in your heart you work iniquity: your hands forge injustice in the earth.
<br>4	The wicked are alienated from the womb; they have gone astray from the womb: they have spoken false things.
<br>5	Their madness is according to the likeness of a serpent: like the deaf asp that stoppeth her ears:
<br>6	Which will not hear the voice of the charm- ers; nor of the wizard that charmeth wisely.
<br>7	God shall break in pieces their teeth in their mouth: the Lord shall break the grinders of the lions.
<br>8	They shall come to nothing, like water run- ning down; he hath bent his bow till they be weakened.
<br>9	Like wax that melteth they shall be taken away: fire hath fallen on them, and they shall not see the sun.
<br>10	Before your thorns could know the brier; he swalloweth them up, as alive, in his wrath.
<br>11	The just shall rejoice when he shall see the revenge: he shall wash his hands in the blood of the sinner.
<br>12	And man shall say: If indeed there be fruit to the just: there is indeed a God that judgeth them on the earth.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 58
<br>Unto the end, destroy not, for David for an in- scription of a title, when Saul sent and watched his house to kill him. [1 Kings 19.]
<br>2	Deliver me from my enemies, O my God; and defend me from them that rise up against me.
<br>3	Deliver me from them that work iniquity, and save me from bloody men.
<br>4	For behold they have caught my soul: the mighty have rushed in upon me:
<br>5	Neither is it my iniquity, nor my sin, O Lord: without iniquity have I ren, and directed my steps.
<br>6	Rise up thou to meet me, and behold: even thou, O Lord, the God of hosts, the God of Is- rael. Attend to visit all the nations: have no mercy on all them that work iniquity.
<br>7	They shall return at everning, and shall suf- fer hunger like dogs: and shall go round about the city.
<br>8	Behold they shall speak with their mouth, and a sword is in their lips: for who, say they, hath heard us?
<br>9	But thou, O Lord, shalt laugh at them: thou shalt bring all the nations to nothing.
<br>10	I will keep my strength to thee: for thou art my protector:
<br>11	My God, his mercy shall prevent me.
<br>12	God shall let me see over my enemies: slay them not, lest at any time my people for- get. Scatter them by thy power; and bring them down, O Lord, my protector:
<br>13	For the sin of their mouth, and the word of their lips: and let them be taken in their pride. And for their cursing and lying they shall be talked of,
<br>14	When they are consumed: when they are consumed by thy wrath, and they shall be no
<br> 
<br>more. And they shall know that God will rule Jacob, and all the ends of the earth.
<br>15	They shall return at evening and shall suf- fer hunger like dogs: and shall go round about the city.
<br>16	They shall be scattered abroad to eat, and shall murmur if they be not filled.
<br>17	But I will sing thy strength: and will extol thy mercy in the morning. For thou art become my support, and my refuge, in the day of my trouble.
<br>18	Unto thee, O my helper, will I sing, for thou art God my defence: my God my mercy.
<br>
<br>Chapter 59
<br>Unto the end, for them that shall be changed, for the inscription of a title, to David himself, for doctrine,
<br>2 When he set fire to Mesopotamia of Syria and Sobal: and Joab returned and slew of Edom, in the vale of the saltpits, twelve thousand men. 3 O God, thou hast cast us off, and hast de- stroyed us; thou hast been angry, and hast had
<br>mercy on us.
<br>4	Thou hast moved the earth, and hast trou- bled it: heal thou the breaches thereof, for it has been moved.
<br>5	Thou hast shewn thy people hard things; thou hast made us drink the wine of sorrow.
<br>6	Thou hast given a warning to them that fear thee: that they may flee from before the bow: That thy beloved may be delivered.
<br>7	Save me with thy right hand, and hear me. 8 God hath spoken in his holy place: I will rejoice, and I will divide Sichem; and will mete
<br>out the vale of tabernacles.
<br>9 Galaad is mine, and Manasses is mine: and Ephraim is the strength of my head. Juda is my
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>king:
<br>10	Moab is the pot of my hope.   Into Edom will I stretch out my shoe: to me the foreigners are made subject.
<br>11	Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?
<br>12	Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou, O God, go out with our armies?
<br>13	Give us help from trouble: for vain is the salvation of man.
<br>14	Through God we shall do mightily: and he shall bring to nothing them that afflict us.
<br>
<br>
<br>Chapter 60
<br>
<br>Unto the end, in hymns, for David.
<br>2	Hear, O God, my supplication: be attentive to my prayer.
<br>3	To thee have I cried from the ends of the earth: when my heart was in anguish, thou hast exalted me on a rock. Thou hast conducted me;
<br>4	For thou hast been my hope; a tower of strength against the face of the enemy.
<br>5	In thy tabernacle I shall dwell for ever: I shall be protected under the covert of thy wings. 6 For thou, my God, hast heard my prayer:
<br>thou hast given an inheritance to them that fear
<br>thy name.
<br>7	Thou wilt add days to the days of the king: his years even to generation and generation.
<br>8	He abideth for ever in the sight of God: his mercy and truth who shall search?
<br>9	So will I sing a psalm to thy name for ever and ever: that I may pay my vows from day to day.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 61
<br>Unto the end, for Idithun, a psalm of David.
<br>2	Shall not my soul be subject to God? for from him is my salvation.
<br>3	For he is my God and my saviour: he is my protector, I shall be moved no more.
<br>4	How long do you rush in upon a man? you all kill, as if you were thrusting down a leaning wall, and a tottering fence.
<br>5	But they have thought to cast away my price; I ran in thirst: they blessed with their mouth, but cursed with their heart.
<br>6	But be thou, O my soul, subject to God: for from him is my patience.
<br>7	For he is my God and my saviour: he is my helper, I shall not be moved.
<br>8	In God is my salvation and my glory: he is the God of my help, and my hope is in God.
<br>9	Trust in him, all ye congregation of people: pour out your hearts before him. God is our helper for ever.
<br>10	But vain are the sons of men, the sons of men are liars in the balances: that by vanity they may together deceive.
<br>11	Trust not in iniquity, and cover not rob- beries: if riches abound, set not your heart upon them.
<br>12	God hath spoken once, these two things have I heard, that power belongeth to God,
<br>13	And mercy to thee, O Lord; for thou wilt render to every man according to his works.
<br>
<br>Chapter 62
<br>A psalm of David while he was in the desert of Edom.
<br>2	O God, my God, to thee do I watch at break of day. For thee my soul hath thirsted; for thee
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>my flesh, O how many ways!
<br>3	In a desert land, and where there is no way, and no water: so in the sanctuary have I come before thee, to see thy power and thy glory.
<br>4	For thy mercy is better than lives: thee my lips will praise.
<br>5	Thus will I bless thee all my life long: and in thy name I will lift up my hands.
<br>6	Let my soul be filled as with marrow and fatness: and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips.
<br>7	If I have remembered thee upon my bed, I will meditate on thee in the morning:
<br>8	Because thou hast been my helper. And I will rejoice under the covert of thy wings:
<br>9	My soul hath stuck close to thee: thy right hand hath received me.
<br>10	But they have fought my soul in vain, they shall go into the lower parts of the earth:
<br>11	They shall be delivered into the hands of the sword, they shall be the portions of foxes.
<br>12	But the king shall rejoice in God, all they shall be praised that swear by him: because the mouth is stopped of them that speak wicked things.
<br>
<br>Chapter 63
<br>
<br>Unto the end, a psalm for David.
<br>2	Hear O God, my prayer, when I make sup- plication to thee: deliver my soul from the fear of the enemy.
<br>3	Thou hast protected me from the assem- bly of the malignant; from the multitude of the workers of iniquity.
<br>4	For they have whetted their tongues like a sword; they have bent their bow a bitter thing,
<br>5	To shoot in secret the undefiled.
<br> 
<br>6	They will shoot at him on a sudden, and will not fear: they are resolute in wickedness. They have talked of hiding snares; they have said: Who shall see them?
<br>7	They have searched after iniquities: they have failed in their search. Man shall come to a deep heart:
<br>8	And God shall be exalted. The arrows of children are their wounds:
<br>9	And their tongues against them are made weak. All that saw them were troubled;
<br>10	And every man was afraid. And they de- clared the works of God, and understood his do- ings.
<br>11	The just shall rejoice in the Lord, and shall hope in him: and all the upright in heart shall be praised.
<br>
<br>Chapter 64
<br>
<br>To the end, a psalm of David. The canticle of Jeremias and Ezechiel to the people of the cap- tivity, when they began to go out.
<br>2	A hymn, O God, becometh thee in Sion: and a vow shall be paid to thee in Jerusalem.
<br>3	O hear my prayer: all flesh shall come to thee.
<br>4	The words of the wicked have prevailed over us: and thou wilt pardon our transgressions.
<br>5	Blessed is he whom thou hast chosen and taken to thee: he shall dwell in thy courts. We shall be filled with the good things of thy house; holy is thy temple,
<br>6	Wonderful in justice. Hear us, O God our saviour, who art the hope of all the ends of the earth, and in the sea afar off.
<br>7	Thou who preparest the mountains by thy strength, being girded with power:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>8	Who troublest the depth of the sea, the noise of its waves. The Gentiles shall be troubled,
<br>9	And they that dwell in the uttermost bor- ders shall be afraid at thy signs: thou shalt make the outgoings of the morning and of the evening to be joyful.
<br>10	Thou hast visited the earth, and hast plen- tifully watered it; thou hast many ways enriched it. The river of God is filled with water, thou hast prepared their food: for so is its prepara- tion.
<br>11	Fill up plentifully the streams thereof, mul- tiply its fruits; it shall spring up and rejoice in its showers.
<br>12	Thou shalt bless the crown of the year of thy goodness: and thy fields shall be filled with plenty.
<br>13	The beautiful places of the wilderness shall grow fat: and the hills shall be girded about with joy,
<br>14	The rams of the flock are clothed, and the vales shall abound with corn: they shall shout, yea they shall sing a hymn.
<br>
<br>Chapter 65
<br>Unto the end, a canticle of a psalm of the resur- rection. Shout with joy to God, all the earth,
<br>2	Sing ye a psalm to his name; give glory to his praise.
<br>3	Say unto God, How terrible are thy works, O Lord! in the multitude of thy strength thy enemies shall lie to thee.
<br>4	Let all the earth adore thee, and sing to thee: let it sing a psalm to thy name.
<br>5	Come and see the works of God; who is ter- rible in his counsels over the sons of men.
<br>6	Who turneth the sea into dry land, in the river they shall pass on foot: there shall we re-
<br> 
<br>joice in him.
<br>7	Who by his power ruleth for ever: his eyes behold the nations; let not them that provoke him be exalted in themselves.
<br>8	O bless our God, ye Gentiles: and make the voice of his praise to be heard.
<br>9	Who hath set my soul to live: and hath not suffered my feet to be moved:
<br>10	For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us by fire, as silver is tried.
<br>11	Thou hast brought us into a net, thou hast laid afflictions on our back:
<br>12	Thou hast set men over our heads. We have passed through fire and water, and thou hast brought us out into a refreshment.
<br>13	I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee my vows,
<br>14	Which my lips have uttered, And my mouth hath spoken, when I was in trouble.
<br>15	I will offer up to thee holocausts full of marrow, with burnt offerings of rams: I will offer to thee bullocks with goats.
<br>16	Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will tell you what great things he hath done for my soul.
<br>17	I cried to him with my mouth: and I ex- tolled him with my tongue.
<br>18	If I have looked at iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.
<br>19	Therefore hath God heard me, and hath attended to the voice of my supplication.
<br>20	Blessed be God, who hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me.
<br>
<br>Chapter 66
<br>
<br>Unto the end, in hymns, a psalm of a canticle for David.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>2 May God have mercy on us, and bless us: may he cause the light of his countenance to shine upon us, and may he have mercy on us.
<br>3	That we may know thy way upon earth: thy salvation in all nations.
<br>4	Let people confess to thee, O God: let all people give praise to thee.
<br>5	Let the nations be glad and rejoice: for thou judgest the people with justice, and directest the nations upon earth.
<br>6	Let the people, O God, confess to thee: let all the people give praise to thee:
<br>7	The earth hath yielded her fruit. May God, our God bless us,
<br>8 May God bless us: and all the ends of the earth fear him.
<br>
<br>Chapter 67
<br>
<br>Unto the end, a psalm of a canticle for David himself.
<br>2	Let God arise, and let his enemies be scat- tered: and let them that hate him flee from be- fore his face.
<br>3	As smoke vanisheth, so let them vanish away: as wax melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.
<br>4	And let the just feast, and rejoice before God: and be delighted with gladness.
<br>5	Sing ye to God, sing a psalm to his name, make a way for him who ascendeth upon the west: the Lord is his name. Rejoice ye before him: but the wicked shall be troubled at his pres- ence,
<br>6	Who is the father of orphans, and the judge of widows. God in his holy place:
<br>7	God who maketh men of one manner to dwell in a house: Who bringeth out them that
<br> 
<br>were bound in strength; in like manner them that provoke, that dwell in sepulchres.
<br>8	O God, when thou didst go forth in the sight of thy people, when thou didst pass through the desert:
<br>9	The earth was moved, and the heavens dropped at the presence of the God of Sina, at the presence of the God of Israel.
<br>10	Thou shalt set aside for thy inheritance a free rain, O God: and it was weakened, but thou hast made it perfect.
<br>11	In it shall thy animals dwell; in thy sweet- ness, O God, thou hast provided for the poor.
<br>12	The Lord shall give the word to them that preach good tidings with great power.
<br>13	The king of powers is of the beloved, of the beloved; and the beauty of the house shall divide spoils.
<br>14	If you sleep among the midst of lots, you shall be as the wings of a dove covered with sil- ver, and the hinder parts of her back with the paleness of gold.
<br>15	When he that is in heaven appointeth kings over her, they shall be whited with snow in Sel- mon.
<br>16	The mountain of God is a fat mountain. A curdled mountain, a fat mountain.
<br>17	Why suspect, ye curdled mountains? A mountain in which God is well pleased to dwell: for there the Lord shall dwell unto the end.
<br>18	The chariot of God is attended by ten thou- sands; thousands of them that rejoice: the Lord is among them in Sina, in the holy place.
<br>19	Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive; thou hast received gifts in men. Yea for those also that do not believe, the dwelling of the Lord God.
<br>20	Blessed be the Lord day by day: the God of our salvation will make our journey prosperous to us.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>21	Our God is the God of salvation: and of the Lord, of the Lord are the issues from death. 22 But God shall break the heads of his ene- mies: the hairy crown of them that walk on in
<br>their sins.
<br>23	The Lord said: I will turn them from Basan, I will turn them into the depth of the sea:
<br>24	That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thy enemies; the tongue of thy dogs be red with the same.
<br>25	They have seen thy goings, O God, the goings of my God: of my king who is in his sanc- tuary.
<br>26	Princes went before joined with singers, in the midst of young damsels playing on timbrels. 27 In the churches bless ye God the Lord, from
<br>the fountains of Israel.
<br>28	There is Benjamin a youth, in ecstasy of mind. The princes of Juda are their leaders: the princes of Zabulon, the princes of Nephthali.
<br>29	Command thy strength, O God confirm, O God, what thou hast wrought in us.
<br>30	From thy temple in Jerusalem, kings shall offer presents to thee.
<br>31	Rebuke the wild beasts of the reeds, the congregation of bulls with the kine of the people; who seek to exclude them who are tried with silver. Scatter thou the nations that delight in wars:
<br>32	Ambassadors shall come out of Egypt: Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands to God. 33 Sing to God, ye kingdoms of the earth: sing
<br>ye to the Lord: Sing ye to God,
<br>34	Who mounteth above the heaven of heav- ens, to the east. Behold he will give to his voice the voice of power:
<br>35	Give ye glory to God for Israel, his mag- nificence, and his power is in the clouds.
<br> 
<br>36	God is wonderful in his saints: the God of Israel is he who will give power and strength to his people. Blessed be God.
<br>
<br>Chapter 68
<br>
<br>Unto the end, for them that shall be changed; for David.
<br>2	Save me, O God: for the waters are come in even unto my soul.
<br>3	I stick fast in the mire of the deep and there is no sure standing. I am come into the depth of the sea, and a tempest hath overwhelmed me.
<br>4	I have laboured with crying; my jaws are become hoarse, my eyes have failed, whilst I hope in my God.
<br>5	They are multiplied above the hairs of my head, who hate me without cause. My enemies are grown strong who have wrongfully perse- cuted me: then did I pay that which I took not away.
<br>6	O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my offences are not hidden from thee:
<br>7	Let not them be ashamed for me, who look for thee, O Lord, the Lord of hosts. Let them not be confounded on my account, who seek thee, O God of Israel.
<br>8	Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face.
<br>9	I am become a stranger to my brethren, and an alien to the sons of my mother.
<br>10	For the zeal of thy house hath eaten me up: and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.
<br>11	And I covered my soul in fasting: and it was made a reproach to me.
<br>12	And I made haircloth my garment: and I became a byword to them.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>13	They that sat in the gate spoke against me: and they that drank wine made me their song.
<br>14	But as for me, my prayer is to thee, O Lord; for the time of thy good pleasure, O God. In the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation.
<br>15	Draw me out of the mire, that I may not stick fast: deliver me from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.
<br>16	Let not the tempest of water drown me, nor the deep water swallow me up: and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.
<br>17	Hear me, O Lord, for thy mercy is kind; look upon me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.
<br>18	And turn not away thy face from thy ser- vant: for I am in trouble, hear me speedily.
<br>19	Attend to my soul, and deliver it: save me because of my enemies.
<br>20	Thou knowest my reproach, and my con- fusion, and my shame.
<br>21	In thy sight are all they that afflict me; my heart hath expected reproach and misery. And I looked for one that would grieve together with me, but there was none: and for one that would comfort me, and I found none.
<br>22	And they gave me gall for my food, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
<br>23	Let their table become as a snare before them, and a recompense, and a stumblingblock. 24 Let their eyes be darkened that they see
<br>not; and their back bend thou down always.
<br>25	Pour out thy indignation upon them: and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.
<br>26	Let their habitation be made desolate: and let there be none to dwell in their tabernacles.
<br>27	Because they have persecuted him whom thou hast smitten; and they have added to the grief of my wounds.
<br> 
<br>28	Add thou iniquity upon their iniquity: and let them not come into thy justice.
<br>29	Let them be blotted out of the book of the living; and with the just let them not be written. 30 But I am poor and sorrowful: thy salvation,
<br>O God, hath set me up.
<br>31	I will praise the name of God with a can- ticle: and I will magnify him with praise.
<br>32	And it shall please God better than a young calf, that bringeth forth horns and hoofs.
<br>33	Let the poor see and rejoice: seek ye God, and your soul shall live.
<br>34	For the Lord hath heard the poor: and hath not despised his prisoners.
<br>35	Let the heavens and the earth praise him; the sea, and every thing that creepeth therein.
<br>36	For God will save Sion, and the cities of Juda shall be built up. And they shall dwell there, and acquire it by inheritance.
<br>37	And the seed of his servants shall possess it; and they that love his name shall dwell therein.
<br>
<br>Chapter 69
<br>Unto the end, a psalm for David, to bring to remembrance that the Lord saved him.
<br>2	O God, come to my assistance; O Lord, make haste to help me.
<br>3	Let them be confounded and ashamed that seek my soul:
<br>4	Let them be turned backward, and blush for shame that desire evils to me: Let them be presently turned away blushing for shame that say to me: ’Tis well, ’tis well.
<br>5	Let all that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee; and let such as love thy salvation say always: The Lord be magnified.
<br>6	But I am needy and poor; O God, help me. Thou art my helper and my deliverer: O lord,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>make no delay.
<br>
<br>Chapter 70
<br>A psalm for David. Of the sons of Jonadab, and the former captives. In thee, O Lord, I have hoped, let me never be put to confusion:
<br>2	Deliver me  in thy justice, and rescue me.
<br>Incline thy ear unto me, and save me.
<br>3	Be thou unto me a God, a protector, and a place of strength: that thou mayst make me safe. For thou art my firmament and my refuge. 4 Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the sinner, and out of the hand of the transgres-
<br>sor of the law and of the unjust.
<br>5	For thou art my patience, O Lord: my hope, O Lord, from my youth.
<br>6	By thee have I been confirmed from the womb: from my mother’s womb thou art my protector. Of thee I shall continually sing:
<br>7	I am become unto many as a wonder, but thou art a strong helper.
<br>8	Let my mouth be filled with praise, that I may sing thy glory; thy greatness all the day long.
<br>9	Cast me not off in the time of old age: when my strength shall fail, do not thou forsake me.
<br>10	For my enemies have spoken against me; and they that watched my soul have consulted together,
<br>11	Saying: God hath forsaken him: pursue and take him, for there is none to deliver him.
<br>12	O God, be not thou far from me: O my God, make haste to my help.
<br>13	Let them be confounded and come to noth- ing that detract my soul; let them be covered with confusion and blame that seek my hurt.
<br>14	But I will always hope; and will add to all thy praise.
<br> 
<br>15	My mouth shall shew forth thy justice; thy salvation all the day long. Because I have not known learning,
<br>16	I will enter into the powers of the Lord: O Lord, I will be mindful of thy justice alone.
<br>17	Thou hast taught me, O God, from my youth: and till now I will declare thy wonderful works.
<br>18	And unto old age and grey hairs: O God, forsake me not, Until I shew forth thy arm to all the generation that is to come: Thy power,
<br>19	And thy justice, O God, even to the highest great things thou hast done: O God, who is like to thee?
<br>20	How great troubles hast thou shewn me, many and grievous: and turning thou hast brought me to life, and hast brought me back again from the depths of the earth:
<br>21	Thou hast multiplied thy magnificence; and turning to me thou hast comforted me.
<br>22	For I will also confess to thee thy truth with the instruments of psaltery: O God, I will sing to thee with the harp, thou holy one of Israel.
<br>23	My lips shall greatly rejoice, when I shall sing to thee; and my soul which thou hast re- deemed.
<br>24	Yea and my tongue shall meditate on thy justice all the day; when they shall be con- founded and put to shame that seek evils to me.
<br>
<br>Chapter 71
<br>A psalm on Solomon.
<br>2	Give to the king thy judgment, O God, and to the king’s son thy justice: To judge thy people with justice, and thy poor with judgment.
<br>3	Let the mountains receive peace for the peo- ple: and the hills justice.
<br>4	He shall judge the poor of the people, and
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>he shall save the children of the poor: and he shall humble the oppressor.
<br>5	And he shall continue with the sun and be- fore the moon, throughout all generations.
<br>6	He shall come down like rain upon the fleece; and as showers falling gently upon the earth.
<br>7	In his days shall justice spring up, and abun- dance of peace, till the moon be taken away.
<br>8	And he shall rule from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.
<br>9	Before him the Ethiopians shall fall down: and his enemies shall lick the ground.
<br>10	The kings of Tharsis and the islands shall offer presents: the kings of the Arabians and of Saba shall bring gifts:
<br>11	And all kings of the earth shall adore him: all nations shall serve him.
<br>12	For he shall deliver the poor from the mighty: and the needy that had no helper.
<br>13	He shall spare the poor and needy: and he shall save the souls of the poor.
<br>14	He shall redeem their souls from usuries and iniquity: and their names shall be hon- ourable in his sight.
<br>15	And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Arabia, for him they shall always adore: they shall bless him all the day.
<br>16	And there shall be a firmament on the earth on the tops of mountains, above Libanus shall the fruit thereof be exalted: and they of the city shall flourish like the grass of the earth.
<br>17	Let his name be blessed for evermore: his name continueth before the sun. And in him shall all the tribes of the earth be blessed: all nations shall magnify him.
<br>18	Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who alone doth wonderful things.
<br>19	And blessed be the name of his majesty for ever: and the whole earth shall be filled with his majesty. So be it. So be it.
<br> 
<br>20	The praises of David, the son of Jesse, are ended.
<br>
<br>Chapter 72
<br>
<br>A psalm for Asaph. How good is God to Israel, to them that are of a right heart!
<br>2	But my feet were almost moved; my steps had well nigh slipped.
<br>3	Because I had a zeal on occasion of the wicked, seeing the prosperity of sinners.
<br>4	For there is no regard to their death, nor is there strength in their stripes.
<br>5	They are not in the labour of men: neither shall they be scourged like other men.
<br>6	Therefore pride hath held them fast: they are covered with their iniquity and their wicked- ness.
<br>7	Their iniquity hath come forth, as it were from fatness: they have passed into the affection of the heart.
<br>8	They have thought and spoken wickedness: they have spoken iniquity on high.
<br>9	They have set their mouth against heaven: and their tongue hath passed through the earth. 10 Therefore will my people return here and
<br>full days shall be found in them.
<br>11	And they said: How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?
<br>12	Behold these are sinners; and yet, abound- ing in the world they have obtained riches.
<br>13	And I said: Then have I in vain justified my heart, and washed my hands among the in- nocent.
<br>14	And I have been scourged all the day; and my chastisement hath been in the mornings.
<br>15	If I said: I will speak thus; behold I should condemn the generation of thy children.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>16	I studied that I might know this thing, it is a labour in my sight:
<br>17	Until I go into the sanctuary of God, and understand concerning their last ends.
<br>18	But indeed for deceits thou hast put it to them: when they were lifted up thou hast cast them down.
<br>19	How are they brought to desolation? they have suddenly ceased to be: they have perished by reason of their iniquity.
<br>20	As the dream of them that awake, O Lord; so in thy city thou shalt bring their image to nothing.
<br>21	For my heart hath been inflamed, and my reins have been changed:
<br>22	And I am brought to nothing, and I knew not.
<br>23	I am become as a beast before thee: and I am always with thee.
<br>24	Thou hast held me by my right hand; and by thy will thou hast conducted me,  and with thy glory thou hast received me.
<br>25	For what have I in heaven? and besides thee what do I desire upon earth?
<br>26	For thee my flesh and my heart hath fainted away: thou art the God of my heart, and the God that is my portion for ever.
<br>27	For behold they that go far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that are disloyal to thee.
<br>28	But it is good for me to adhere to my God, to put my hope in the Lord God: That I may de- clare all thy praises, in the gates of the daughter of Sion.
<br>
<br>Chapter 73
<br>Understanding for Asaph. O God, why hast thou cast us off unto the end: why is thy wrath enkin-
<br> 
<br>dled against the sheep of thy pasture?
<br>2	Remember thy congregation, which thou hast possessed from the beginning.   The scep- tre of thy inheritance which thou hast redeemed: mount Sion in which thou hast dwelt.
<br>3	Lift up thy hands against their pride unto the end; see what things the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.
<br>4	And they that hate thee have made their boasts, in the midst of thy solemnity. They have set up their ensigns for signs,
<br>5	And they knew not both in the going out and on the highest top. As with axes in a wood of trees,
<br>6	They have cut down at once the gates thereof, with axe and hatchet they have brought it down.
<br>7	They have set fire to thy sanctuary: they have defiled the dwelling place of thy name on the earth.
<br>8	They said in their heart, the whole kindred of them together: Let us abolish all the festival days of God from the land.
<br>9	Our signs we have not seen, there is now no prophet: and he will know us no more.
<br>10	How long, O God, shall the enemy re- proach: is the adversary to provoke thy name for ever?
<br>11	Why dost thou turn away thy hand: and thy right hand out of the midst of thy bosom for ever?
<br>12	But God is our king before ages: he hath wrought salvation in the midst of the earth.
<br>13	Thou by thy strength didst make the sea firm: thou didst crush the heads of the dragons in the waters.
<br>14	Thou hast broken the heads of the dragon: thou hast given him to be meat for the people of the Ethiopians.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>15	Thou hast broken up the fountains and the torrents: thou hast dried up the Ethan rivers.
<br>16	Thine is the day, and thine is the night: thou hast made the morning light and the sun.
<br>17	Thou hast made all the borders of the earth: the summer and the spring were formed by thee.
<br>18	Remember this, the enemy hath re- proached the Lord: and a foolish people hath provoked thy name.
<br>19	Deliver not up to beasts the souls that con- fess to thee: and forget not to the end the souls of thy poor.
<br>20	Have regard to thy covenant: for they that are the obscure of the earth have been filled with dwellings of iniquity.
<br>21	Let not the humble be turned away with confusion: the poor and needy shall praise thy name.
<br>22	Arise, O God, judge thy own cause: re- member thy reproaches with which the foolish man hath reproached thee all the day.
<br>23	Forget not the voices of thy enemies: the pride of them that hate thee ascendeth continu- ally.
<br>
<br>Chapter 74
<br>Unto the end, corrupt not, a psalm of a canticle for Asaph.
<br>2	We will praise thee, O God: we will praise, and we will call upon thy name. We will relate thy wondrous works:
<br>3	When I shall take a time, I will judge jus- tices.
<br>4	The earth is melted, and all that dwell therein: I have established the pillars thereof.
<br>5	I said to the wicked: Do not act wickedly: and to the sinners: Lift not up the horn.
<br> 
<br>6	Lift not up your horn on high: speak not iniquity against God.
<br>7	For neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the desert hills:
<br>8	For God is the judge. One he putteth down, and another he lifteth up:
<br>9	For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup of strong wine full of mixture. And he hath poured it out from this to that: but the dregs thereof are not emptied: all the sinners of the earth shall drink.
<br>10	But I will declare for ever: I will sing to the God of Jacob.
<br>11	And I will break all the horns of sinners: but the horns of the just shall be exalted. Psalms Chapter 75
<br>Unto the end, in praises, a psalm for Asaph: a canticle to the Assyrians.
<br>2	In Judea God is known: his name is great in Israel.
<br>3	And his place is in peace: and his abode in Sion:
<br>4	There hath he broken the powers of bows, the shield, the sword, and the battle.
<br>5	Thou enlightenest wonderfully from the ev- erlasting hills.
<br>6	All the foolish of heart were troubled. They have slept their sleep; and all the men of riches have found nothing in their hands.
<br>7	At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, they have all slumbered that mounted on horseback.
<br>8	Thou art terrible, and who shall resist thee? from that time thy wrath.
<br>9	Thou hast caused judgment to be heard from heaven: the earth trembled and was still,
<br>10	When God arose in judgment, to save all the meek of the earth.
<br>11	For the thought of man shall give praise to thee: and the remainders of the thought shall keep holiday to thee.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>12	Vow ye, and pay to the Lord your God: all you that are round about him bring presents. To him that is terrible,
<br>13	Even to him who taketh away the spirit of princes: to the terrible with the kings of the earth.
<br>
<br>Chapter 76
<br>
<br>Unto the end, for Idithun, a psalm of Asaph.
<br>2	I cried to the Lord with my voice; to God with my voice, and he gave ear to me.
<br>3	In the days of my trouble I sought God, with my hands lifted up to him in the night, and I was not deceived. My soul refused to be comforted:
<br>4	I remembered God, and was delighted, and was exercised, and my spirit swooned away.
<br>5	My eyes prevented the watches: I was trou- bled, and I spoke not.
<br>6	I thought upon the days of old: and I had in my mind the eternal years.
<br>7	And I meditated in the night with my own heart: and I was exercised and I swept my spirit. 8 Will God then cast off for ever? or will he
<br>never be more favourable again?
<br>9	Or will he cut off his mercy for ever, from generation to generation?
<br>10	Or will God forget to shew mercy? or will he in his anger shut up his mercies?
<br>11	And I said, Now have I begun: this is the change of the right hand of the most High.
<br>12	I remembered the works of the Lord: for I will be mindful of thy wonders from the begin- ning.
<br>13	And I will meditate on all thy works: and will be employed in thy inventions.
<br>14	Thy way, O God, is in the holy place: who is the great God like our God?
<br> 
<br>15	Thou art the God that dost wonders. Thou hast made thy power known among the nations: 16 With thy arm thou hast redeemed thy peo-
<br>ple the children of Jacob and of Joseph.
<br>17	The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee: and they were afraid, and the depths were troubled.
<br>18	Great was the noise of the waters: the clouds sent out a sound. For thy arrows pass:
<br>19	The voice of thy thunder in a wheel. Thy lightnings enlightened the world: the earth shook and trembled.
<br>20	Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths in many waters: and thy footsteps shall not be known.
<br>21	Thou hast conducted thy people like sheep, by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
<br>
<br>Chapter 77
<br>Understanding for Asaph. Attend, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
<br>2	I will open my mouth in parables: I will utter propositions from the beginning.
<br>3	How great things have we heard and known, and our fathers have told us.
<br>4	They have not been hidden from their children, in another generation. Declaring the praises of the Lord, and his powers, and his won- ders which he hath done.
<br>5	And he set up a testimony in Jacob: and made a law in Israel. How great things he com- manded our fathers, that they should make the same known to their children:
<br>6	That another generation might know them. The children that should be born and should rise up, and declare them to their children.
<br>7	That they may put their hope in God and
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>may not forget the works of God: and may seek his commandments.
<br>8	That they may not become like their fathers, a perverse and exasperating generation. A gen- eration that set not their heart aright: and whose spirit was not faithful to God.
<br>9	The sons of Ephraim who bend and shoot with the bow: they have turned back in the day of battle.
<br>10	They kept not the covenant of God: and in his law they would not walk.
<br>11	And they forgot his benefits, and his won- ders that he had shewn them.
<br>12	Wonderful things did he do in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Tanis.
<br>13	He divided the sea and brought them through: and he made the waters to stand as in a vessel.
<br>14	And he conducted them with a cloud by day: and all the night with a light of fire.
<br>15	He struck the rock in the wilderness: and gave them to drink, as out of the great deep.
<br>16	He brought forth water out of the rock: and made streams run down as rivers.
<br>17	And they added yet more sin against him: they provoked the most High to wrath in the place without water.
<br>18	And they tempted God in their hearts, by asking meat for their desires.
<br>19	And they spoke ill of God: they said: Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?
<br>20	Because he struck the rock, and the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed. Can he also give bread, or provide a table for his people? 21 Therefore the Lord heard, and was angry: and a fire was kindled against Jacob, and wrath
<br>came up against Israel.
<br>22	Because they believed not in God: and trusted not in his salvation.
<br> 
<br>23	And he had commanded the clouds from above, and had opened the doors of heaven.
<br>24	And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them the bread of heaven. 25 Man ate the bread of angels: he sent them
<br>provisions in abundance.
<br>26 He removed the south wind from heaven: and by his power brought in the southwest wind. 27 And he rained upon them flesh as dust:
<br>and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea.
<br>28	And they fell in the midst of their camp, round about their pavilions.
<br>29	So they did eat, and were filled exceedingly, and he gave them their desire:
<br>30	they were not defrauded of that which they craved. As yet their meat was in their mouth:
<br>31	And the wrath of God came upon them. And he slew the fat ones amongst them, and brought down the chosen men of Israel.
<br>32	In all these things they sinned still: and they behaved not for his wondrous works.
<br>33	And their days were consumed in vanity, and their years in haste.
<br>34	When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned, and came to him early in the morning.
<br>35	And they remembered that God was their helper: and the most high God their redeemer.
<br>36	And they loved him with their mouth: and with their tongue they lied unto him:
<br>37	But their heart was not right with him: nor were they counted faithful in his covenant.
<br>38	But he is merciful, and will forgive their sins: and will not destroy them. And many a time did he turn away his anger: and did not kindle all his wrath.
<br>39	And he remembered that they are flesh: a wind that goeth and returneth not.
<br>40	How often did they provoke him in the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>desert: and move him to wrath in the place with- out water?
<br>41	And they turned back and tempted God: and grieved the holy one of Israel.
<br>42	They remembered not his hand, in the day that he redeemed them from the hand of him that afflicted them:
<br>43	How he wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Tanis.
<br>44	And he turned their rivers into blood, and their showers that they might not drink.
<br>45	He sent amongst them divers sorts of flies, which devoured them: and frogs which destroyed them.
<br>46	And he gave up their fruits to the blast, and their labours to the locust.
<br>47	And he destroyed their vineyards with hail, and their mulberry trees with hoarfrost.
<br>48	And he gave up their cattle to the hail, and their stock to the fire.
<br>49	And he sent upon them the wrath of his indignation: indignation and wrath and trouble, which he sent by evil angels.
<br>50	He made a way for a path to his anger: he spared not their souls from death, and their cattle he shut up in death.
<br>51	And he killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt: the firstfruits of all their labour in the tabernacles of Cham.
<br>52	And he took away his own people as sheep: and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
<br>53	And he brought them out in hope and they feared not: and the sea overwhelmed their ene- mies.
<br>54	And he brought them into the mountain of his sanctuary: the mountain which his right hand had purchased. And he cast out the Gen- tiles before them: and by lot divided to them their land by a line of distribution.
<br> 
<br>55	And he made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tabernacles.
<br>56	Yet they tempted, and provoked the most high God: and they kept not his testimonies.
<br>57	And they turned away, and kept not the covenant: even like their fathers they were turned aside as a crooked bow.
<br>58	They provoked him to anger on their hills: and moved him to jealousy with their graven things.
<br>59	God heard, and despised them, and he re- duced Israel exceedingly as it were to nothing.
<br>60	And he put away the tabernacle of Silo, his tabernacle where he dwelt among men.
<br>61	And he delivered their strength into cap- tivity: and their beauty into the hands of the enemy.
<br>62	And he shut up his people under the sword: and he despised his inheritance.
<br>63	Fire consumed their young men: and their maidens were not lamented.
<br>64	Their priests fell by the sword: and their widows did not mourn.
<br>65	And the Lord was awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that hath been sur- feited with wine.
<br>66	And he smote his enemies on the hinder parts: he put them to an everlasting reproach.
<br>67	And he rejected the tabernacle of Joseph: and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:
<br>68	But he chose the tribe of Juda, mount Sion which he loved.
<br>69	And he built his sanctuary as of unicorns, in the land which he founded for ever.
<br>70	And he chose his servant David, and took him from the flocks of sheep: he brought him from following the ewes great with young,
<br>71	To feed Jacob his servant and Israel his inheritance.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>72	And he fed them in the innocence of his heart: and conducted them by the skilfulness of his hands.
<br>
<br>Chapter 78
<br>A psalm for Asaph. O God, the heathens are come into thy inheritance, they have defiled thy holy temple: they have made Jerusalem as a place to keep fruit.
<br>2	They have given the dead bodies of thy ser- vants to be meat for the fowls of the air: the flesh of thy saints for the beasts of the earth.
<br>3	They have poured out their blood as water, round about Jerusalem and there was none to bury them.
<br>4	We are become a reproach to our neigh- bours: a scorn and derision to them that are round about us.
<br>5	How long, O Lord, wilt thou be angry for ever: shall thy zeal be kindled like a fire?
<br>6	Pour out thy wrath upon the nations that have not known thee: and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.
<br>7	Because they have devoured Jacob; and have laid waste his place.
<br>8	Remember not our former iniquities: let thy mercies speedily prevent us, for we are become exceeding poor.
<br>9	Help us, O God, our saviour: and for the glory of thy name, O Lord, deliver us: and for- give us our sins for thy name’s sake:
<br>10	Lest they should say among the Gentiles: Where is their God? And let him be made known among the nations before our eyes, By the re- venging the blood of thy servants, which hath been shed:
<br>11	Let the sighing of the prisoners come in before thee. According to the greatness of thy
<br> 
<br>arm, take possession of the children of them that have been put to death.
<br>12	And render to our neighbours sevenfold in their bosom: the reproach wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.
<br>13	But we thy people, and the sheep of thy pasture, will give thanks to thee for ever.   We will shew forth thy praise, unto generation and generation.
<br>
<br>Chapter 79
<br>Unto the end, for them that shall be changed, a testimony for Asaph, a psalm.
<br>2	Give ear, O thou that rulest Israel: thou that leadest Joseph like a sheep. Thou that sittest upon the cherubims, shine forth
<br>3	Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasses.
<br>Stir up thy might, and come to save us.
<br>4	Convert us, O God: and shew us thy face, and we shall be saved.
<br>5	O Lord God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy servant?
<br>6	How long wilt thou feed us with the bread of tears: and give us for our drink tears in measure? 7 Thou hast made us to be a contradiction to our neighbours: and our enemies have scoffed at
<br>us.
<br>8	O God of hosts, convert us: and shew thy face, and we shall be saved.
<br>9	Thou hast brought a vineyard out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the Gentiles and planted it.
<br>10	Thou wast the guide of its journey in its sight: thou plantedst the roots thereof, and it filled the land.
<br>11	The shadow of it covered the hills: and the branches thereof the cedars of God.
<br>12	It stretched forth its branches unto the sea, and its boughs unto the river.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>13	Why hast thou broken down the hedge thereof, so that all they who pass by the way do pluck it?
<br>14	The boar out of the wood hath laid it waste: and a singular wild beast hath devoured it.
<br>15	Turn again, O God of hosts, look down from heaven, and see, and visit this vineyard:
<br>16	And perfect the same which thy right hand hath planted: and upon the son of man whom thou hast confirmed for thyself.
<br>17	Things set on fire and dug down shall per- ish at the rebuke of thy countenance.
<br>18	Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand: and upon the son of man whom thou hast confirmed for thyself.
<br>19	And we depart not from thee, thou shalt quicken us: and we will call upon thy name.
<br>20	O Lord God of hosts, convert us and shew thy face, and we shall be saved.
<br>
<br>Chapter 80
<br>
<br>Unto the end, for the winepresses, a psalm for Asaph himself.
<br>2	Rejoice to God our helper: sing aloud to the God of Jacob.
<br>3	Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel: the pleasant psaltery with the harp.
<br>4	Blow up the trumpet on the new moon, on the noted day of your solemnity.
<br>5	For it is a commandment in Israel, and a judgment to the God of Jacob.
<br>6	He ordained it for a testimony in Joseph, when he came out of the land of Egypt: he heard a tongue which he knew not.
<br>7	He removed his back from the burdens: his hands had served in baskets.
<br> 
<br>8	Thou calledst upon me in affliction, and I delivered thee: I heard thee in the secret place of tempest: I proved thee at the waters of con- tradiction.
<br>9	Hear, O my people, and I will testify to thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken to me, 10 there shall be no new god in thee: neither shalt thou adore a strange god.
<br>11	For I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.
<br>12	But my people heard not my voice: and Israel hearkened not to me.
<br>13	So I let them go according to the desires of their heart: they shall walk in their own inven- tions.
<br>14	If my people had heard me: if Israel had walked in my ways:
<br>15	I should soon have humbled their enemies, and laid my hand on them that troubled them. 16 The enemies of the Lord have lied to him:
<br>and their time shall be for ever.
<br>17 And he fed them with the fat of wheat, and filled them with honey out of the rock.
<br>
<br>Chapter 81
<br>A psalm for Asaph. God hath stood in the con- gregation of gods: and being in the midst of them he judgeth gods.
<br>2	How long will you judge unjustly: and ac- cept the persons of the wicked?
<br>3	Judge for the needy and fatherless: do jus- tice to the humble and the poor.
<br>4	Rescue the poor; and deliver the needy out of the hand of the sinner.
<br>5	They have not known nor understood: they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth shall be moved.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>6	I have said: You are gods and all of you the sons of the most High.
<br>7	But you like men shall die: and shall fall like one of the princes.
<br>8	Arise, O God, judge thou the earth: for thou shalt inherit among all the nations.
<br>
<br>Chapter 82
<br>A canticle of a psalm for Asaph.
<br>2	O God, who shall be like to thee? hold not thy peace, neither be thou still, O God.
<br>3	For lo, thy enemies have made a noise: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head.
<br>4	They have taken a malicious counsel against thy people, and have consulted against thy saints.
<br>5	They have said: Come and let us destroy them, so that they be not a nation: and let the name of Israel be remembered no more.
<br>6	For they have contrived with one consent: they have made a covenant together against thee,
<br>7	The tabernacle of the Edomites, and the Ishmahelites: Moab, and the Agarens,
<br>8	Gebal, and Ammon and Amalec: the Philistines, with the inhabitants of Tyre.
<br>9	Yea, and the Assyrian also is joined with them: they are come to the aid of the sons of Lot.
<br>10	Do to them as thou didst to Madian and to Sisara: as to Jabin at the brook of Cisson.
<br>11	Who perished at Endor: and became as dung for the earth.
<br>12	Make their princes like Oreb, and Zeb, and Zebee, and Salmana. All their princes,
<br>13	Who have said: Let us possess the sanctu- ary of God for an inheritance.
<br>14	O my God, make them like a wheel; and as stubble before the wind.
<br> 
<br>15	As fire which burneth the wood: and as a flame burning mountains:
<br>16	So shalt thou pursue them with thy tem- pest: and shalt trouble them in thy wrath.
<br>17	Fill their faces with shame; and they shall seek thy name, O Lord.
<br>18	Let them be ashamed and troubled for ever and ever: and let them be confounded and per- ish.
<br>19	And let them know that the Lord is thy name: thou alone art the most High over all the earth.
<br>
<br>Chapter 83
<br>Unto the end, for the winepresses, a psalm for the sons of Core.
<br>2	How lovely are thy tabernacles, O Lord of hosts!
<br>3	my soul longeth and fainteth for the courts of the Lord. My heart and my flesh have rejoiced in the living God.
<br>4	For the sparrow hath found herself a house, and the turtle a nest for herself where she may lay her young ones: Thy altars, O Lord of hosts, my king and my God.
<br>5	Blessed are they that dwell in thy house, O Lord: they shall praise thee for ever and ever.
<br>6	Blessed is the man whose help is from thee: in his heart he hath disposed to ascend by steps, 7 In the vale of tears, in the place which he
<br>hath set.
<br>8	For the lawgiver shall give a blessing, they shall go from virtue to virtue: the God of gods shall be seen in Sion.
<br>9	O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob.
<br>10	Behold, O God our protector: and look on the face of thy Christ.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>11	For better is one day in thy courts above thousands. I have chosen to be an abject in the house of my God, rather than to dwell in the tabernacles of sinners.
<br>12	For God loveth mercy and truth: the Lord will give grace and glory.
<br>13	He will not deprive of good things them that walk in innocence: O Lord of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.
<br>
<br>Chapter 84
<br>
<br>Unto the end, for the sons of Core, a psalm.
<br>2	Lord, thou hast blessed thy land: thou hast turned away the captivity of Jacob.
<br>3	Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy peo- ple: thou hast covered all their sins.
<br>4	Thou hast mitigated all thy anger: thou hast turned away from the wrath of thy indignation. 5 Convert us, O God our saviour: and turn off
<br>thy anger from us.
<br>6	Wilt thou be angry with us for ever: or wilt thou extend thy wrath from generation to gen- eration?
<br>7	Thou wilt turn, O God, and bring us to life: and thy people shall rejoice in thee.
<br>8	Shew us, O Lord, thy mercy; and grant us thy salvation.
<br>9	I will hear what the Lord God will speak in me: for he will speak peace unto his people: And unto his saints: and unto them that are converted to the heart.
<br>10	Surely his salvation is near to them that fear him : that glory may dwell in our land.
<br>11	Mercy and truth have met each other: jus- tice and peace have kissed.
<br>12	Truth is sprung out of the earth: and jus- tice hath looked down from heaven.
<br> 
<br>13	For the Lord will give goodness: and our earth shall yield her fruit.
<br>14	Justice shall walk before him: and ,shall set his steps in the way.
<br>
<br>Chapter 85
<br>A prayer for David himself. Incline thy ear, O Lord, and hear me: for I am needy and poor.
<br>2	Preserve my soul, for I am holy: save thy servant, O my God, that trusteth in thee.
<br>3	Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I have cried to thee all the day.
<br>4	Give joy to the soul of thy servant, for to thee, O Lord, I have lifted up my soul.
<br>5	For thou, O Lord, art sweet and mild: and plenteous in mercy to all that call upon thee.
<br>6	Give ear, O Lord, to my prayer: and attend to the voice of my petition.
<br>7	I have called upon thee in the day of my trouble: because thou hast heard me.
<br>8	There is none among the gods like unto thee, O Lord: and there is none according to thy works.
<br>9	All the nations thou hast made shall come and adore before thee, O Lord: and they shall glorify thy name.
<br>10	For thou art great and dost wonderful things: thou art God alone.
<br>11	Conduct me, O Lord, in thy way, and I will walk in thy truth: let my heart rejoice that it may fear thy name.
<br>12	I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with my whole heart, and I will glorify thy name for ever:
<br>13	For thy mercy is great towards me: and thou hast delivered my soul out of the lower hell. 14 O God, the wicked are risen up against me, and the assembly of the mighty have sought
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>my soul: and they have not set thee before their eyes.
<br>15	And thou, O Lord, art a God of compas- sion, and merciful, patient, and of much mercy, and true.
<br>16	O look upon me, and have mercy on me: give thy command to thy servant, and save the son of thy handmaid.
<br>17	Shew me a token for good: that they who hate me may see, and be confounded, because thou, O Lord, hast helped me and hast com- forted me.
<br>
<br>Chapter 86
<br>For the sons of Core, a psalm of a canticle. The foundations thereof are the holy mountains:
<br>2	The Lord loveth the gates of Sion above all the tabernacles of Jacob.
<br>3	Glorious things are said of thee, O city of God.
<br>4	I will be mindful of Rahab and of Babylon knowing me. Behold the foreigners, and Tyre, and the people of the Ethiopians, these were there.
<br>5	Shall not Sion say: This man and that man is born in her? and the Highest himself hath founded her.
<br>6	The Lord shall tell in his writings of peoples and of princes, of them that have been in her.
<br>7	The dwelling in thee is as it were of all re- joicing.
<br>
<br>Chapter 87
<br>A canticle of a psalm for the sons of Core: unto the end, for Maheleth, to answer understanding of Eman the Ezrahite.
<br> 
<br>2	O Lord, the God of my salvation: I have cried in the day, and in the night before thee.
<br>3	Let my prayer come in before thee: incline thy ear to my petition.
<br>4	For my soul is filled with evils: and my life hath drawn nigh to hell.
<br>5	I am counted among them that go down to the pit: I am become as a man without help,
<br>6	Free among the dead. Like the slain sleeping in the sepulchres, whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy hand.
<br>7	They have laid me in the lower pit: in the dark places, and in the shadow of death.
<br>8	Thy wrath is strong over me: and all thy waves thou hast brought in upon me.
<br>9	Thou hast put away my acquaintance far from me: they have set me an abomination to themselves. I was delivered up, and came not forth:
<br>10	My eyes languished through poverty. All the day I cried to thee, O Lord: I stretched out my hands to thee.
<br>11	Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? or shall physicians raise to life, and give praise to thee?
<br>12	Shall any one in the sepulchre declare thy mercy: and thy truth in destruction?
<br>13	Shall thy wonders be known in the dark; and thy justice in the land of forgetfulness?
<br>14	But I, O Lord, have cried to thee: and in the morning my prayer shall prevent thee.
<br>15	Lord, why castest thou off my prayer: why turnest thou away thy face from me?
<br>16	I am poor, and in labours from my youth: and being exalted have been humbled and trou- bled.
<br>17	Thy wrath hath come upon me: and thy terrors have troubled me.
<br>18	They have come round about me like wa- ter all the day: they have compassed me about
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>together.
<br>19	Friend and neighbour thou hast put far from me: and my acquaintance, because of mis- ery.
<br>
<br>Chapter 88
<br>
<br>Of understanding, for Ethan the Ezrahite.
<br>2	The mercies of the Lord I will sing for ever. I will shew forth thy truth with my mouth to generation and generation.
<br>3	For thou hast said: Mercy shall be built up for ever in the heavens: thy truth shall be prepared in them.
<br>4	I have made a covenant with my elect: I have sworn to David my servant:
<br>5	Thy seed will I settle for ever. And I will build up thy throne unto generation and gener- ation.
<br>6	The heavens shall confess thy wonders, O Lord: and thy truth in the church of the saints. 7 For who in the clouds can be compared to the Lord: or who among the sons of God shall
<br>be like to God?
<br>8	God, who is glorified in the assembly of the saints: great and terrible above all them that are about him.
<br>9	O Lord God of hosts, who is like to thee? thou art mighty, O Lord, and thy truth is round about thee.
<br>10	Thou rulest the power of the sea: and ap- peasest the motion of the waves thereof.
<br>11	Thou hast humbled the proud one, as one that is slain: with the arm of thy strength thou hast scattered thy enemies.
<br>12	Thine are the heavens, and thine is the earth: the world and the fulness thereof thou hast founded:
<br> 
<br>13	The north and the sea thou hast created. Thabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name:
<br>14	Thy arm is with might. Let thy hand be strengthened, and thy right hand exalted:
<br>15	Justice and judgment are the preparation of thy throne. Mercy and truth shall go before thy face:
<br>16	Blessed is the people that knoweth jubila- tion. They shall walk, O Lord, in the light of thy countenance:
<br>17	And in thy name they shall rejoice all the day, and in thy justice they shall be exalted.
<br>18	For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy good pleasure shall our horn be ex- alted.
<br>19	For our protection is of the Lord, and of our king the holy one of Israel.
<br>20	Then thou spokest in a vision to thy saints, and saidst: I have laid help upon one that is mighty, and have exalted one chosen out of my people.
<br>21	I have found David my servant: with my holy oil I have anointed him.
<br>22	For my hand shall help him: and my arm shall strengthen him.
<br>23	The enemy shall have no advantage over him: nor the son of iniquity have power to hurt him.
<br>24	And I will cut down his enemies before his face; and them that hate him I will put to flight. 25 And my truth and my mercy shall be with him: and in my name shall his horn be exalted. 26 And I will set his hand in the sea; and his
<br>right hand in the rivers.
<br>27	He shall cry out to me: Thou art my father: my God, and the support of my salvation.
