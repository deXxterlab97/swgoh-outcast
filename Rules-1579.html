<br>
<br>(a) Payment and Use.—
<br>
<br>(1) Payment.—The Secretary shall pay to each unit of general local government which qualifies for a payment under this chapter an amount equal to the sum of any amounts allocated to the government under this chapter for each payment period. The Secretary shall pay such amount out of the Local Government Fiscal Assistance Fund under section 6702.
<br>
<br>(2) Use.—Amounts paid to a unit of general local government under this section shall be used by that unit for carrying out one or more programs of the unit related to—
<br>
<br>(A) education to prevent crime;
<br>
<br>(B) substance abuse treatment to prevent crime; or
<br>
<br>(C) job programs to prevent crime.
<br>
<br>(3) Coordination.—Programs funded under this title shall be coordinated with other existing Federal programs to meet the overall needs of communities that benefit from funds received under this section.
<br>
<br>(b) Timing of Payments.—The Secretary shall pay each amount allocated under this chapter to a unit of general local government for a payment period by the later of 90 days after the date the amount is available or the first day of the payment period provided that the unit of general local government has provided the Secretary with the assurances required by section 6703(d).
<br>
<br>(c) Adjustments.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—Subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary shall adjust a payment under this chapter to a unit of general local government to the extent that a prior payment to the government was more or less than the amount required to be paid.
<br>
<br>(2) Considerations.—The Secretary may increase or decrease under this subsection a payment to a unit of local government only if the Secretary determines the need for the increase or decrease, or the unit requests the increase or decrease, within one year after the end of the payment period for which the payment was made.
<br>
<br>(d) Reservation for Adjustments.—The Secretary may reserve a percentage of not more than 2 percent of the amount under this section for a payment period for all units of general local government in a State if the Secretary considers the reserve is necessary to ensure the availability of sufficient amounts to pay adjustments after the final allocation of amounts among the units of general local government in the State.
<br>
<br>(e) Repayment of Unexpended Amounts.—
<br>
<br>(1) Repayment required.—A unit of general local government shall repay to the Secretary, by not later than 15 months after receipt from the Secretary, any amount that is—
<br>
<br>(A) paid to the unit from amounts appropriated under the authority of this section; and
<br>
<br>(B) not expended by the unit within one year after receipt from the Secretary.
<br>
<br>(2) Penalty for failure to repay.—If the amount required to be repaid is not repaid, the Secretary shall reduce payments in future payment periods accordingly.
<br>
<br>(3) Deposit of amounts repaid.—Amounts received by the Secretary as repayments under this subsection shall be deposited in the Local Government Fiscal Assistance Fund for future payments to units of general local government.
<br>
<br>(f) Expenditure With Disadvantaged Business Enterprises.—
<br>
<br>(1) General rule.—Of amounts paid to a unit of general local government under this chapter for a payment period, not less than 10 percent of the total combined amounts obligated by the unit for contracts and subcontracts shall be expended with—
<br>
<br>(A) small business concerns controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals and women;
<br>
<br>(B) historically Black colleges and universities and colleges and universities having a student body in which more than 20 percent of the students are Hispanic Americans or Native Americans; and
<br>
<br>(C) qualified HUBZone small business concerns.
<br>
<br>(2) Exception.—Paragraph (1) shall not apply to amounts paid to a unit of general local government to the extent the unit determines that the paragraph does not apply through a process that provides for public participation.
<br>
<br>(3) Definitions.—For purposes of this subsection—
<br>
<br>(A) the term "small business concern" has the meaning such term has under section 3 of the Small Business Act;
<br>
<br>(B) the term "socially and economically disadvantaged individuals" has the meaning such term has under section 8(d) of the Small Business Act and relevant subcontracting regulations promulgated pursuant to that section; and
<br>
<br>(C) the term "qualified HUBZone small business concern" has the meaning given that term in section 3(p) 1 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632(o) 2).
<br>
<br>(g) Nonsupplanting Requirement.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—Funds made available under this chapter to units of local government shall not be used to supplant State or local funds, but will be used to increase the amount of funds that would, in the absence of funds under this chapter, be made available from State or local sources.
<br>
<br>(2) Base level amount.—The total level of funding available to a unit of local government for accounts serving eligible purposes under this chapter in the fiscal year immediately preceding receipt of a grant under this chapter shall be designated the "base level account" for the fiscal year in which a grant is received. Grants under this chapter in a given fiscal year shall be reduced on a dollar for dollar basis to the extent that a unit of local government reduces its base level account in that fiscal year.

<br>§6704. State area allocations; allocations and payments to territorial governments
<br>
<br>(a) Formula Allocation by State.—For each payment period, the Secretary shall allocate to each State out of the amount appropriated for the period under the authority of section 6702(b) (minus the amounts allocated to territorial governments under subsection (e) for the payment period) an amount bearing the same ratio to the amount appropriated (minus such amounts allocated under subsection (e)) as the amount allocated to the State under this section bears to the total amount allocated to all States under this section. The Secretary shall—
<br>
<br>(1) determine the amount allocated to the State under subsection (b) or (c) of this section and allocate the larger amount to the State; and
<br>
<br>(2) allocate the amount allocated to the State to units of general local government in the State under sections 6705 and 6706.
<br>
<br>(b) General Formula.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—For the payment period beginning October 1, 1994, the amount allocated to a State under this subsection for a payment period is the amount bearing the same ratio to $5,300,000,000 as—
<br>
<br>(A) the population of the State, multiplied by the general tax effort factor of the State (determined under paragraph (2)), multiplied by the relative income factor of the State (determined under paragraph (3)), multiplied by the relative rate of the labor force unemployed in the State (determined under paragraph (4)); bears to
<br>
<br>(B) the sum of the products determined under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph for all States.
<br>
<br>(2) General tax effort factor.—The general tax effort factor of a State for a payment period is—
<br>
<br>(A) the net amount of State and local taxes of the State collected during the year 1991 as reported by the Bureau of the Census in the publication Government Finances 1990–1991; divided by
<br>
<br>(B) the total income of individuals, as determined by the Secretary of Commerce for national accounts purposes for 1992 as reported in the publication Survey of Current Business (August 1993), attributed to the State for the same year.
<br>
<br>(3) Relative income factor.—The relative income factor of a State is a fraction in which—
<br>
<br>(A) the numerator is the per capita income of the United States; and
<br>
<br>(B) the denominator is the per capita income of the State.
<br>
<br>(4) Relative rate of labor force.—The relative rate of the labor force unemployed in a State is a fraction in which—
<br>
<br>(A) the numerator is the percentage of the labor force of the State that is unemployed in the calendar year preceding the payment period (as determined by the Secretary of Labor for general statistical purposes); and
<br>
<br>(B) the denominator is the percentage of the labor force of the United States that is unemployed in the calendar year preceding the payment period (as determined by the Secretary of Labor for general statistical purposes).
<br>
<br>(c) Alternative Formula.—For the payment period beginning October 1, 1994, the amount allocated to a State under this subsection for a payment period is the total amount the State would receive if—
<br>
<br>(1) $1,166,666,667 were allocated among the States on the basis of population by allocating to each State an amount bearing the same ratio to the total amount to be allocated under this paragraph as the population of the State bears to the population of all States;
<br>
<br>(2) $1,166,666,667 were allocated among the States on the basis of population inversely weighted for per capita income, by allocating to each State an amount bearing the same ratio to the total amount to be allocated under this paragraph as—
<br>
<br>(A) the population of the State, multiplied by a fraction in which—
<br>
<br>(i) the numerator is the per capita income of all States; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the denominator is the per capita income of the State; bears to
<br>
<br>(B) the sum of the products determined under subparagraph (A) for all States;
<br>
<br>(3) $600,000,000 were allocated among the States on the basis of income tax collections by allocating to each State an amount bearing the same ratio to the total amount to be allocated under this paragraph as the income tax amount of the State (determined under subsection (d)(1)) bears to the sum of the income tax amounts of all States;
<br>
<br>(4) $600,000,000 were allocated among the States on the basis of general tax effort by allocating to each State an amount bearing the same ratio to the total amount to be allocated under this paragraph as the general tax effort amount of the State (determined under subsection (d)(2)) bears to the sum of the general tax effort amounts of all States;
<br>
<br>(5) $600,000,000 were allocated among the States on the basis of unemployment by allocating to each State an amount bearing the same ratio to the total amount to be allocated under this paragraph as—
<br>
<br>(A) the labor force of the State, multiplied by a fraction in which—
<br>
<br>(i) the numerator is the percentage of the labor force of the State that is unemployed in the calendar year preceding the payment period (as determined by the Secretary of Labor for general statistical purposes); and
<br>
<br>(ii) the denominator is the percentage of the labor force of the United States that is unemployed in the calendar year preceding the payment period (as determined by the Secretary of Labor for general statistical purposes)
<br>
<br>bears to
<br>
<br>(B) the sum of the products determined under subparagraph (A) for all States; and
<br>
<br>(6) $1,166,666,667 were allocated among the States on the basis of urbanized population by allocating to each State an amount bearing the same ratio to the total amount to be allocated under this paragraph as the urbanized population of the State bears to the urbanized population of all States. In this paragraph, the term "urbanized population" means the population of an area consisting of a central city or cities of at least 50,000 inhabitants and the surrounding closely settled area for the city or cities considered as an urbanized area as published by the Bureau of the Census for 1990 in the publication General Population Characteristics for Urbanized Areas.
<br>
<br>(d) Income Tax Amount and Tax Effort Amount.—
<br>
<br>(1) Income tax amount.—The income tax amount of a State for a payment period is 15 percent of the net amount collected during the calendar year ending before the beginning of the payment period from the tax imposed on the income of individuals by the State and described as a State income tax under section 164(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 164(a)(3)). The income tax amount for a payment period shall be at least 1 percent but not more than 6 percent of the United States Government individual income tax liability attributed to the State for the taxable year ending during the last calendar year ending before the beginning of the payment period. The Secretary shall determine the Government income tax liability attributed to the State by using the data published by the Secretary for 1991 in the publication Statistics of Income Bulletin (Winter 1993–1994).
<br>
<br>(2) General tax effort amount.—The general tax effort amount of a State for a payment period is the amount determined by multiplying—
<br>
<br>(A) the net amount of State and local taxes of the State collected during the year 1991 as reported in the Bureau of 1 Census in the publication Government Finances 1990–1991; and
<br>
<br>(B) the general tax effort factor of the State determined under subsection (b)(2).
<br>
<br>(e) Allocation for Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, and the Virgin Islands.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—(A) For each payment period for which funds are available for allocation under this chapter, the Secretary shall allocate to each territorial government an amount equal to the product of 1 percent of the amount of funds available for allocation multiplied by the applicable territorial percentage.
<br>
<br>(B) For the purposes of this paragraph, the applicable territorial percentage of a territory is equal to the quotient resulting from the division of the territorial population of such territory by the sum of the territorial population for all territories.
<br>
<br>(2) Payments to local governments.—The governments of the territories shall make payments to local governments within their jurisdiction from sums received under this subsection as they consider appropriate.
<br>
<br>(3) Definitions.—For purposes of this subsection—
<br>
<br>(A) the term "territorial government" means the government of a territory;
<br>
<br>(B) the term "territory" means Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, and the Virgin Islands; and
<br>
<br>(C) the term "territorial population" means the most recent population for each territory as determined by the Bureau of 1 Census.

<br>§6705. Local government allocations
<br>
<br>(a) Indian Tribes and Alaskan Natives Villages.—If there is in a State an Indian tribe or Alaskan native 1 village having a recognized governing body carrying out substantial governmental duties and powers, the Secretary shall allocate to the tribe or village, out of the amount allocated to the State under section 6704, an amount bearing the same ratio to the amount allocated to the State as the population of the tribe or village bears to the population of the State. The Secretary shall allocate amounts under this subsection to Indian tribes and Alaskan native 1 villages in a State before allocating amounts to units of general local government in the State under subsection (c). For the payment period beginning October 1, 1994, the Secretary shall use as the population of each Indian tribe or Alaskan native 1 village the population for 1991 as reported by the Bureau of Indian Affairs in the publication Indian Service Population and Labor Force Estimates (January 1991). In addition to uses authorized under section 6701(a)(2), amounts allocated under this subsection and paid to an Indian tribe or Alaskan native 1 village under this chapter may be used for renovating or building prisons or other correctional facilities.
<br>
<br>(b) Newly Incorporated Local Governments and Annexed Governments.—If there is in a State a unit of general local government that has been incorporated since the date of the collection of the data used by the Secretary in making allocations pursuant to sections 6704 through 6706 and 6708, the Secretary shall allocate to this newly incorporated local government, out of the amount allocated to the State under section 6704, an amount bearing the same ratio to the amount allocated to the State as the population of the newly incorporated local government bears to the population of the State. If there is in the State a unit of general local government that has been annexed since the date of the collection of the data used by the Secretary in making allocations pursuant to sections 6704 through 6706 and 6708, the Secretary shall pay the amount that would have been allocated to this local government to the unit of general local government that annexed it.
<br>
<br>(c) Other Local Government Allocations.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—The Secretary shall allocate among the units of general local government in a State (other than units receiving allocations under subsection (a)) the amount allocated to the State under section 6704 (as that amount is reduced by allocations under subsection (a)). Of the amount to be allocated, the Secretary shall allocate a portion equal to ½ of such amount in accordance with section 6706(1), and shall allocate a portion equal to ½ of such amount in accordance with section 6706(2). A unit of general local government shall receive an amount equal to the sum of amounts allocated to the unit from each portion.
<br>
<br>(2) Ratio.—From each portion to be allocated to units of local government in a State under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall allocate to a unit an amount bearing the same ratio to the funds to be allocated as—
<br>
<br>(A) the population of the unit, multiplied by the general tax effort factor of the unit (determined under paragraph (3)), multiplied by the income gap of the unit (determined under paragraph (4)), bears to
<br>
<br>(B) the sum of the products determined under subparagraph (A) for all units in the State for which the income gap for that portion under paragraph (4) is greater than zero.

<br>
<br>(ii) The Secretary shall, for purposes of clause (i), include that part of sales taxes transferred to a unit of general local government that are imposed by a county government in the geographic area of which is located the unit of general local government as taxes imposed by the unit for public purposes if—

<br>
<br>(II) the chief executive officer of the State notifies the Secretary that the taxes satisfy the requirements of this clause.
<br>
<br>(iii) The adjusted taxes of a unit of general local government shall not exceed the maximum allowable adjusted taxes for that unit.
<br>

<br>
<br>(v) The allowable adjusted taxes of a unit of general government is the greater of—
<br>
<br>(I) the amount equal to 2.5, multiplied by the per capita adjusted taxes of all units of general local government of the same type in the State, multiplied by the population of the unit; or
<br>
<br>(II) the amount equal to the population of the unit, multiplied by the sum of the adjusted taxes of all units of municipal local government in the State, divided by the sum of the populations of all the units of municipal local government in the State.
<br>

<br>
<br>(II) 1.5 multiplied by the allowable adjusted taxes of the unit;
<br>
<br>except that if this amount is less than zero then the excess adjusted taxes of the unit is deemed to be zero.
<br>
<br>(vii) For purposes of this subparagraph—
<br>

<br>
<br>(i) the number which applies under section 6706, multiplied by the per capita income of the State in which the unit is located; minus
<br>
<br>(ii) the per capita income of the geographic area of the unit.
<br>
<br>(B) If the amount determined under subparagraph (A) for a unit of general local government is less than zero, then the relative income factor of the unit is deemed to be zero.
<br>
<br>(d) Small Government Allocations.—If the Secretary decides that information available for a unit of general local government with a population below a number (of not more than 500) prescribed by the Secretary is inadequate, the Secretary may allocate to the unit, in lieu of any allocation under subsection (b) for a payment period, an amount bearing the same ratio to the total amount to be allocated under subsection (b) for the period for all units of general local government in the State as the population of the unit bears to the population of all units in the State.
