<br>
<br>(1) provide technical assistance to local educational agencies, parents, and Indian tribes to enable such agencies, parents, and tribes to carry out this section; and

<br>(A) Any tribe, or its designee, which has students in attendance at a local educational agency may, in its discretion and without regard to the requirements of any other provision of law, file a written complaint with the Secretary regarding any action of a local educational agency taken pursuant to, or relevant to, the requirements of this section.

<br>(8) Withholding
<br>
<br>If the local educational agency rejects the determination of the Secretary, or if the remedy required is not undertaken within the time established and the Secretary determines that an extension of the time established will not effectively encourage the remedy required, the Secretary shall withhold payment of all moneys to which such local agency is eligible under section 7703 of this title until such time as the remedy required is undertaken, except where the complaining tribe or its designee formally requests that such funds be released to the local educational agency, except that the Secretary may not withhold such moneys during the course of the school year if the Secretary determines that such withholding would substantially disrupt the educational programs of the local educational agency.
<br>(9) Rejection of determination
<br>

<br>(4) Award criteria
<br>
<br>In awarding emergency grants and modernization grants under this subsection, the Secretary shall consider the following factors:

<br>
<br>(i) the agency's level of bonded indebtedness;
<br>
<br>(ii) the assessed value of real property per student that may be taxed for school purposes compared to the average of the assessed value of real property per student that may be taxed for school purposes in the State in which the agency is located;
<br>
<br>(iii) the agency's total tax rate for school purposes (or, if applicable, for capital expenditures) compared to the average total tax rate for school purposes (or the average capital expenditure tax rate, if applicable) in the State in which the agency is located; and

<br>
<br>(D) In the case of an emergency grant, the severity of the emergency, as measured by the threat that the condition of the school facility poses to the health, safety, and well-being of students.
<br>
<br>(E) In the case of a modernization grant—
<br>
<br>(i) the severity of the need for modernization, as measured by such factors as—
<br>
<br>(I) overcrowding, as evidenced by the use of portable classrooms, or the potential for future overcrowding because of increased enrollment; or
<br>
<br>(II) the agency's inability to utilize technology or offer a curriculum in accordance with contemporary State standards due to the physical limitations of the current school facility; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the age of the school facility proposed for modernization.

<br>(III) the acquisition of real property.
<br>(iii) Supplement, not supplant
<br>
<br>A local educational agency shall use funds provided under an emergency grant or modernization grant awarded under this subsection only to supplement the amount of funds that would, in the absence of the Federal funds provided under the grant, be made available from non-Federal sources to carry out emergency repairs of school facilities or to carry out the modernization of school facilities, as the case may be, and not to supplant such funds.
<br>(iv) Maintenance costs
<br>

<br>(B) Emergency grants; prohibition on use of funds
<br>
<br>A local educational agency that is awarded an emergency grant under this subsection may not use amounts under the grant for the complete or partial replacement of an existing school facility unless such replacement is less expensive or more cost-effective than correcting the identified emergency.

<br>§7709. State consideration of payments in providing State aid
<br>(a) General prohibition
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subsection (b), a State may not—
<br>
<br>(1) consider payments under this subchapter in determining for any fiscal year—
<br>
<br>(A) the eligibility of a local educational agency for State aid for free public education; or
<br>
<br>(B) the amount of such aid; or
<br>
<br>(2) make such aid available to local educational agencies in a manner that results in less State aid to any local educational agency that is eligible for such payment than such agency would receive if such agency were not so eligible.
<br>(b) State equalization plans
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>A State may reduce State aid to a local educational agency that receives a payment under section 7702 or 7703(b) of this title (except the amount calculated in excess of 1.0 under section 7703(a)(2)(B) of this title and, with respect to a local educational agency that receives a payment under section 7703(b)(2) of this title, the amount in excess of the amount that the agency would receive if the agency were deemed to be an agency eligible to receive a payment under section 7703(b)(1) of this title and not section 7703(b)(2) of this title) for any fiscal year if the Secretary determines, and certifies under subsection (c)(3)(A), that the State has in effect a program of State aid that equalizes expenditures for free public education among local educational agencies in the State.
<br>(2) Computation
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>For purposes of paragraph (1), a program of State aid equalizes expenditures among local educational agencies if, in the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made, the amount of per-pupil expenditures made by, or per-pupil revenues available to, the local educational agency in the State with the highest such per-pupil expenditures or revenues did not exceed the amount of such per-pupil expenditures made by, or per-pupil revenues available to, the local educational agency in the State with the lowest such expenditures or revenues by more than 25 percent.
<br>(B) Other factors
<br>
<br>In making a determination under this subsection, the Secretary shall—
<br>
<br>(i) disregard local educational agencies with per-pupil expenditures or revenues above the 95th percentile or below the 5th percentile of such expenditures or revenues in the State; and
<br>
<br>(ii) take into account the extent to which a program of State aid reflects the additional cost of providing free public education in particular types of local educational agencies, such as those that are geographically isolated, or to particular types of students, such as children with disabilities.
<br>(3) Exception
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding paragraph (2), if the Secretary determines that the State has substantially revised its program of State aid, the Secretary may certify such program for any fiscal year only if—
<br>
<br>(A) the Secretary determines, on the basis of projected data, that the State's program will meet the disparity standard described in paragraph (2) for the fiscal year for which the determination is made; and
<br>
<br>(B) the State provides an assurance to the Secretary that, if final data do not demonstrate that the State's program met such standard for the fiscal year for which the determination is made, the State will pay to each affected local educational agency the amount by which the State reduced State aid to the local educational agency.
<br>(c) Procedures for review of State equalization plans
<br>(1) Written notice
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Any State that wishes to consider payments described in subsection (b)(1) in providing State aid to local educational agencies shall submit to the Secretary, not later than 120 days before the beginning of the State's fiscal year, a written notice of such State's intention to do so.
<br>(B) Contents
<br>
<br>Such notice shall be in the form that the Secretary requires, including evidence that the State has notified each local educational agency in the State of such State's intention to consider such payments in providing State aid.
<br>(2) Opportunity to present views
<br>
<br>Before making a determination under subsection (b), the Secretary shall afford the State, and local educational agencies in the State, an opportunity to present their views.
<br>(3) Qualification procedures
<br>
<br>If the Secretary determines that a program of State aid qualifies under subsection (b), the Secretary shall—
<br>
<br>(A) certify the program and so notify the State; and
<br>
<br>(B) afford an opportunity for a hearing, in accordance with section 7711(a) of this title, to any local educational agency adversely affected by such certification.
<br>(4) Nonqualification procedures
<br>
<br>If the Secretary determines that a program of State aid does not qualify under subsection (b), the Secretary shall—
<br>
<br>(A) so notify the State; and
<br>
<br>(B) afford an opportunity for a hearing, in accordance with section 7711(a) of this title, to the State, and to any local educational agency adversely affected by such determination.
<br>(d) Treatment of State aid
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>If a State has in effect a program of State aid for free public education for any fiscal year, which is designed to equalize expenditures for free public education among the local educational agencies of that State, payments under this subchapter for any fiscal year may be taken into consideration by such State in determining the relative—
<br>
<br>(A) financial resources available to local educational agencies in that State; and
<br>
<br>(B) financial need of such agencies for the provision of free public education for children served by such agency, except that a State may consider as local resources funds received under this subchapter only in proportion to the share that local tax revenues covered under a State equalization program are of total local tax revenues.
<br>(2) Prohibition
<br>
<br>A State may not take into consideration payments under this subchapter before such State's program of State aid has been certified by the Secretary under subsection (c)(3).
<br>(e) Remedies for State violations
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary or any aggrieved local educational agency may, not earlier than 150 days after an adverse determination by the Secretary against a State for violation of subsections (a) or (d)(2) or for failure to carry out an assurance under subsection (b)(3)(B), and if an administrative proceeding has not been concluded within such time, bring an action in a United States district court against such State for such violations or failure.
<br>(2) Immunity
<br>
<br>A State shall not be immune under the 11th amendment to the Constitution of the United States from an action described in paragraph (1).
<br>(3) Relief
<br>
<br>The court shall grant such relief as the court determines is appropriate.
