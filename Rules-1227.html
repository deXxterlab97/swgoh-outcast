<br>Nuclear Weapons Reduction
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 102–484, div. A, title XIII, §1321, Oct. 23, 1992, 106 Stat. 2549, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(a) Findings.—The Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>"(1) On February 1, 1992, the President of the United States and the President of the Russian Federation agreed in a Joint Statement that 'Russia and the United States do not regard each other as potential adversaries' and stated further that, 'We will work to remove any remnants of cold war hostility, including taking steps to reduce our strategic arsenals'.
<br>
<br>"(2) In the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, in exchange for the non-nuclear-weapon states agreeing not to seek a nuclear weapons capability nor to assist other non-nuclear-weapon states in doing so, the United States agreed to seek the complete elimination of all nuclear weapons worldwide, as declared in the preamble to the Treaty, which states that it is a goal of the parties to the Treaty to 'facilitate the cessation of the manufacture of nuclear weapons, the liquidation of all their existing stockpiles, and the elimination from national arsenals of nuclear weapons and the means of their delivery' as well as in Article VI of the Treaty, which states that 'each of the parties to the Treaty undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to the cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament'.
<br>
<br>"(3) Carrying out a policy of seeking further significant and continuous reductions in the nuclear arsenals of all countries, besides reducing the likelihood of the proliferation of nuclear weapons and increasing the likelihood of a successful extension and possible strengthening of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in 1995, when the Treaty is scheduled for review and possible extension, has additional benefits to the national security of the United States, including—
<br>
<br>"(A) a reduced risk of accidental enablement and launch of a nuclear weapon, and
<br>
<br>"(B) a defense cost savings which could be reallocated for deficit reduction or other important national needs.
<br>
<br>"(4) The Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START) Treaty and the agreement by the President of the United States and the President of the Russian Federation on June 17, 1992, to reduce the strategic nuclear arsenals of each country to a level between 3,000 and 3,500 weapons are commendable intermediate stages in the process of achieving the policy goals described in paragraphs (1) and (2).
<br>
<br>"(5) The current international era of cooperation provides greater opportunities for achieving worldwide reduction and control of nuclear weapons and material than any time since the emergence of nuclear weapons 50 years ago.
<br>
<br>"(6) It is in the security interests of both the United States and the world community for the President and the Congress to begin the process of reducing the number of nuclear weapons in every country through multilateral agreements and other appropriate means.
<br>
<br>"(7) In a 1991 study, a committee of the National Academy of Sciences concluded that: 'The appropriate new levels of nuclear weapons cannot be specified at this time, but it seems reasonable to the committee that U.S. strategic forces could in time be reduced to 1,000–2,000 nuclear warheads, provided that such a multilateral agreement included appropriate levels and verification measures for the other nations that possess nuclear weapons. This step would require successful implementation of our proposed post-START U.S.-Soviet reductions, related confidence-building measures in all the countries involved, and multilateral security cooperation in areas such as conventional force deployments and planning.'.
<br>
<br>"(b) United States Policy.—It shall be the goal of the United States—
<br>
<br>"(1) to encourage and facilitate the denuclearization of Ukraine, Byelarus, and Kazakhstan, as agreed upon in the Lisbon ministerial meeting of May 23, 1992;
<br>
<br>"(2) to rapidly complete and submit for ratification by the United States the treaty incorporating the agreement of June 17, 1992, between the United States and the Russian Federation to reduce the number of strategic nuclear weapons in each country's arsenal to a level between 3,000 and 3,500;
<br>
<br>"(3) to facilitate the ability of the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Byelarus, and Kazakhstan to implement agreed mutual reductions under the START Treaty, and under the Joint Understanding of June 16–17, 1992 between the United States and the Russian Federation, on an accelerated timetable, so that all such reductions can be completed by the year 2000;
<br>
<br>"(4) to build on the agreement reached in the Joint Understanding of June 16–17, 1992, by entering into multilateral negotiations with the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, France, and the People's Republic of China, and, at an appropriate point in that process, enter into negotiations with other nuclear armed states in order to reach subsequent stage-by-stage agreements to achieve further reductions in the number of nuclear weapons in all countries;
<br>
<br>"(5) to continue and extend cooperative discussions with the appropriate authorities of the former Soviet military on means to maintain and improve secure command and control over nuclear forces;
<br>
<br>"(6) in consultation with other member countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and other allies, to initiate discussions to bring tactical nuclear weapons into the arms control process; and
<br>
<br>"(7) to ensure that the United States assistance to securely transport and store, and ultimately dismantle, former Soviet nuclear weapons and missiles for such weapons is being properly and effectively utilized.
<br>
<br>"(c) Annual Report.—By February 1 of each year, the President shall submit to the Congress a report on—
<br>
<br>"(1) the actions that the United States has taken, and the actions the United States plans to take during the next 12 months, to achieve each of the goals set forth in paragraphs (1) through (6) of subsection (b); and
<br>
<br>"(2) the actions that have been taken by the Russian Federation, by other former Soviet republics, and by other countries to achieve those goals.
<br>
<br>Each such report shall be submitted in unclassified form, with a classified appendix if necessary."

<br>        
<br>§6001. Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>(1) The government of Fidel Castro has demonstrated consistent disregard for internationally accepted standards of human rights and for democratic values. It restricts the Cuban people's exercise of freedom of speech, press, assembly, and other rights recognized by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 10, 1948. It has refused to admit into Cuba the representative of the United Nations Human Rights Commission appointed to investigate human rights violations on the island.
<br>
<br>(2) The Cuban people have demonstrated their yearning for freedom and their increasing opposition to the Castro government by risking their lives in organizing independent, democratic activities on the island and by undertaking hazardous flights for freedom to the United States and other countries.
<br>
<br>(3) The Castro government maintains a military-dominated economy that has decreased the well-being of the Cuban people in order to enable the government to engage in military interventions and subversive activities throughout the world and, especially, in the Western Hemisphere. These have included involvement in narcotics trafficking and support for the FMLN guerrillas in El Salvador.
<br>
<br>(4) There is no sign that the Castro regime is prepared to make any significant concessions to democracy or to undertake any form of democratic opening. Efforts to suppress dissent through intimidation, imprisonment, and exile have accelerated since the political changes that have occurred in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
<br>
<br>(5) Events in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe have dramatically reduced Cuba's external support and threaten Cuba's food and oil supplies.
<br>
<br>(6) The fall of communism in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, the now universal recognition in Latin America and the Caribbean that Cuba provides a failed model of government and development, and the evident inability of Cuba's economy to survive current trends, provide the United States and the international democratic community with an unprecedented opportunity to promote a peaceful transition to democracy in Cuba.
<br>
<br>(7) However, Castro's intransigence increases the likelihood that there could be a collapse of the Cuban economy, social upheaval, or widespread suffering. The recently concluded Cuban Communist Party Congress has underscored Castro's unwillingness to respond positively to increasing pressures for reform either from within the party or without.
<br>
<br>(8) The United States cooperated with its European and other allies to assist the difficult transitions from Communist regimes in Eastern Europe. Therefore, it is appropriate for those allies to cooperate with United States policy to promote a peaceful transition in Cuba.

<br>§6002. Statement of policy
<br>
<br>It should be the policy of the United States—
<br>
<br>(1) to seek a peaceful transition to democracy and a resumption of economic growth in Cuba through the careful application of sanctions directed at the Castro government and support for the Cuban people;
<br>
<br>(2) to seek the cooperation of other democratic countries in this policy;
<br>
<br>(3) to make clear to other countries that, in determining its relations with them, the United States will take into account their willingness to cooperate in such a policy;
<br>
<br>(4) to seek the speedy termination of any remaining military or technical assistance, subsidies, or other forms of assistance to the Government of Cuba from any of the independent states of the former Soviet Union;
<br>
<br>(5) to continue vigorously to oppose the human rights violations of the Castro regime;
<br>
<br>(6) to maintain sanctions on the Castro regime so long as it continues to refuse to move toward democratization and greater respect for human rights;
<br>
<br>(7) to be prepared to reduce the sanctions in carefully calibrated ways in response to positive developments in Cuba;
<br>
<br>(8) to encourage free and fair elections to determine Cuba's political future;
<br>
<br>(9) to request the speedy termination of any military or technical assistance, subsidies, or other forms of assistance to the Government of Cuba from the government of any other country; and
<br>
<br>(10) to initiate immediately the development of a comprehensive United States policy toward Cuba in a post-Castro era.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 102–484, div. A, title XVII, §1703, Oct. 23, 1992, 106 Stat. 2576.)
<br>§6003. International cooperation
<br>(a) Cuban trading partners
<br>
<br>The President should encourage the governments of countries that conduct trade with Cuba to restrict their trade and credit relations with Cuba in a manner consistent with the purposes of this chapter.
<br>(b) Sanctions against countries assisting Cuba
<br>(1) Sanctions
<br>
<br>The President may apply the following sanctions to any country that provides assistance to Cuba:
<br>
<br>(A) The government of such country shall not be eligible for assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.] or assistance or sales under the Arms Export Control Act [22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.].
<br>
<br>(B) Such country shall not be eligible, under any program, for forgiveness or reduction of debt owed to the United States Government.
<br>(2) "Assistance to Cuba" defined
<br>
<br>For purposes of paragraph (1), the term "assistance to Cuba"—
<br>
<br>(A) means assistance to or for the benefit of the Government of Cuba that is provided by grant, concessional sale, guaranty, or insurance, or by any other means on terms more favorable than that generally available in the applicable market, whether in the form of a loan, lease, credit, or otherwise, and such term includes subsidies for exports to Cuba and favorable tariff treatment of articles that are the growth, product, or manufacture of Cuba;
<br>
<br>(B) includes an exchange, reduction, or forgiveness of Cuban debt owed to a foreign country in return for a grant of an equity interest in a property, investment, or operation of the Government of Cuba (including the government of any political subdivision of Cuba, and any agency or instrumentality of the Government of Cuba) or of a Cuban national; and

<br>(C) does not include—
