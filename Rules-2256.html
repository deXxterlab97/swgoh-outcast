<br>
<br>In this section, the words "territory (including a possession)" are substituted for "territory, or possession" the 1st time the words appear for clarity, because a possession is a category of territory, that is, one that has very little local autonomy. In subsequent instances, the word "territory" is used in an equivalent sense. The word "Commonwealth" is omitted as being included in "territory (including a possession)".
<br>§100755. Applicability of other laws
<br>
<br>(a) In General.—This section and sections 100501, 100901(d) to (h), 101302(b)(2), 101901(c), and 102711 of this title, and the various authorities relating to the administration and protection of System units, including the provisions of law listed in subsection (b), shall, to the extent that those provisions are not in conflict with any such specific provision, be applicable to System units, and any reference in any of these provisions to a System unit does not limit those provisions to that System unit.
<br>
<br>(b) Applicable Provisions.—The provisions of law referred to in subsection (a) are—
<br>
<br>(1) section 100101(a), chapter 1003, sections 100751(a), 100752, 100753, 101101, 101102, 101511, 102101, 102712, 102901, 104905, and 104906, and chapter 2003 of this title;

<br>
<br>In subsection (a), the words "reference in such Act" are interpreted to mean "reference in such Acts" for clarity.

<br>In subsection (b)(1), the words "relating to donation of land and money", "relating to roads and trails", "relating to approach roads to national monuments", "relating to conveyance of roads to States", "relating to acquisitions of inholdings", and "relating to aid to visitors in emergencies" are omitted as unnecessary. The words "the Act of March 3, 1905 (33 Stat. 873; 16 U.S.C. 10), relating to arrests" are omitted because the Act was repealed by section 10(a)(2) of the Act of August 18, 1970 (known as the National Park System General Authorities Act) (Public Law 91–383), as added by section 2 of the Act of October 7, 1976 (Public Law 94–458, 90 Stat. 1941). The words "relating to services or other accommodations for the public, emergency supplies and services to concessioners, acceptability of travelers checks, care and removal of indigents" are omitted as unnecessary. The words "the Act of October 9, 1965 (79 Stat. 696; 16 U.S.C. 20–20g), relating to concessions" are omitted because the Act was repealed by section 415(a) of the National Parks Omnibus Management Act of 1998 (Public Law 105–391, 112 Stat. 3515).
<br>
<br>In subsection (b)(2), the words "relating to rights of way" are omitted as unnecessary.
<br>
<br>Subsection (b)(3) is added for clarity because many of the laws that established a System unit provided that the Secretary, in addition to administering the unit in accordance with the Act of August 25, 1916 (16 U.S.C. 1, 3, 3, and 4) and with laws generally applicable to System units, administer the unit in accordance with the Act of August 21, 1935 (16 U.S.C. 461 to 467).

The word "Secretary" is substituted for "the head of the department having jurisdiction over the lands" and "chief officer of the department under whose supervision or control such reservation falls" because the portion of the Act of March 4, 1911 (ch. 238, 36 Stat. 1253) classified to 16 U.S.C. 5 relates only to System units.
<br>§100903. Solid waste disposal operations
<br>
<br>(a) In General 1 —To protect the air, land, water, and natural and cultural values of the System and the property of the United States in the System, no solid waste disposal site (including any site for the disposal of domestic or industrial solid waste) may be operated within the boundary of any System unit, other than—
<br>
<br>(1) a site that was operating as of September 1, 1984; or
<br>
<br>(2) a site used only for disposal of waste generated within that System unit so long as the site will not degrade any of the natural or cultural resources of the System unit.
<br>
<br>(b) Regulations.—The Secretary shall prescribe regulations to carry out this section, including reasonable regulations to mitigate the adverse effects of solid waste disposal sites in operation as of September 1, 1984, on property of the United States.

<br>
<br>(2) Use of amounts.—Amounts withheld under paragraph (1) shall be retained by the Secretary and shall be available, without further appropriation, for expenditure by the Secretary for the System unit with respect to which the amounts were collected for the purposes of enhancing the quality of the visitor experience, protection of resources, repair and maintenance, interpretation, signage, habitat or facility enhancement, resource preservation, annual operation (including fee collection), maintenance, and law enforcement.
<br>
<br>(b) Allocation of Funds to System Units.—
<br>
<br>(1) Allocation of funds on basis of need.—Ten percent of the funds made available to the Director under subsection (a) in each fiscal year shall be allocated among System units on the basis of need in a manner to be determined by the Director.
<br>
<br>(2) Allocation of funds based on expenses and based on fees collected.—
<br>
<br>(A) In general.—Forty percent of the funds made available to the Director under subsection (a) in each fiscal year shall be allocated among System units in accordance with subparagraph (B) of this subsection and 50 percent shall be allocated in accordance with subparagraph (C).
<br>
<br>(B) Allocation based on expenses.—The amount allocated to each System unit under this paragraph for each fiscal year based on expenses shall be a fraction of the total allocation to all System units under this paragraph. The fraction for each System unit shall be determined by dividing the operating expenses at that System unit during the prior fiscal year by the total operating expenses at all System units during the prior fiscal year.
<br>
<br>(C) Allocation based on fees collected.—The amount allocated to each System unit under this paragraph for each fiscal year based on fees collected shall be a fraction of the total allocation to all System units under this paragraph.

Funds available to the Service may be used to cover the cost of the surety bond. The Secretary may enter into arrangements with qualified public or private entities pursuant to which the entities may sell (without cost to the United States) annual admission permits (including Golden Eagle Passports) at any appropriate location. The arrangements shall require each such entity to reimburse the United States for the full amount to be received from the sale of the permits at or before the Secretary delivers the permits to the entity for sale.
<br>
<br>(d) Charge for Transportation Provided by Service for Viewing System Units.—
<br>

The remaining 50 percent of the retained amount shall be expended only for activities related to resource protection at those System units.

<br>
<br>(f) Commercial Tour Use Fees.—
<br>
<br>(1) Establishment.—In the case of each System unit for which an admission fee is charged under this section, the Secretary shall establish a commercial tour use fee to be imposed on each vehicle entering the System unit for the purpose of providing commercial tour services within the System unit.
