<br>"[Section 1]. That this Act may be cited as the National Weather Modification Policy Act of 1976.
<br>
<br>"Sec. 2. Declaration of Policy.
<br>
<br>"(a) Findings.—The Congress finds and declares the following:
<br>
<br>"(1) Weather-related disasters and hazards, including drought, hurricanes, tornadoes, hail, lightning, fog, floods, and frost, result in substantial human suffering and loss of life, billions of dollars of annual economic losses to owners of crops and other property, and substantial financial loss to the United States Treasury;
<br>
<br>"(2) Weather modification technology has significant potential for preventing, diverting, moderating, or ameliorating the adverse effects of such disasters and hazards and enhancing crop production and the availability of water;
<br>
<br>"(3) The interstate nature of climatic and related phenomena, the severe economic hardships experienced as the result of occasional drought and other adverse meteorological conditions, and the existing role and responsibilities of the Federal Government with respect to disaster relief, require appropriate Federal action to prevent or alleviate such disasters and hazards; and
<br>
<br>"(4) Weather modification programs may have long-range and unexpected effects on existing climatic patterns which are not confined by national boundaries.
<br>
<br>"(b) Purpose.—It is therefore declared to be the purpose of the Congress in this Act to develop a comprehensive and coordinated national weather modification policy and a national program of weather modification research and development—
<br>
<br>"(1) to determine the means by which deliberate weather modification can be used at the present time to decrease the adverse impact of weather on agriculture, economic growth, and the general public welfare, and to determine the potential for weather modification;
<br>
<br>"(2) to conduct research into those scientific areas considered most likely to lead to practical techniques for drought prevention or alleviation and other forms of deliberate weather modification;
<br>
<br>"(3) to develop practical methods and devices for weather modification;
<br>
<br>"(4) to make weather modification research findings available to interested parties;
<br>
<br>"(5) to assess the economic, social, environmental, and legal impact of an operational weather modification program;
<br>
<br>"(6) to develop both national and international mechanisms designed to minimize conflicts which may arise with respect to the peaceful uses of weather modification; and
<br>
<br>"(7) to integrate the results of existing experience and studies in weather modification activities into model codes and agreements for regulation of domestic and international weather modification activities.
<br>
<br>"Sec. 3. Definitions.

<br>"(2) The term 'State' means any State of the United States, the District of Columbia, or any Commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States.
<br>
<br>"(3) The term 'weather modification' means any activity performed with the intention and expectation of producing changes in precipitation, wind, fog, lightning, and other atmospheric phenomena.
<br>
<br>"Sec. 4. Study.
<br>
<br>"The Secretary shall conduct a comprehensive investigation and study of the state of scientific knowledge concerning weather modification, the present state of development of weather modification technology, the problems impeding effective implementation of weather modification technology, and other related matters. Such study shall include—
<br>
<br>"(1) a review and analysis of the present and past research efforts to establish practical weather modification technology, particularly as it relates to reducing loss of life and crop and property destruction;
<br>
<br>"(2) a review and analysis of research needs in weather modification to establish areas in which more research could be expected to yield the greatest return in terms of practical weather modification technology;
<br>
<br>"(3) a review and analysis of existing studies to establish the probable economic importance to the United States in terms of agricultural production, energy, and related economic factors if the present weather modification technology were to be effectively implemented;
<br>
<br>"(4) an assessment of the legal, social, and ecological implications of expanded and effective research and operational weather modification projects;
<br>
<br>"(5) formulation of one or more options for a model regulatory code for domestic weather modification activities, such code to be based on a review and analysis of experience and studies in this area, and to be adaptable to State and national needs;
<br>
<br>"(6) recommendations concerning legislation desirable at all levels of government to implement a national weather modification policy and program;
<br>
<br>"(7) a review of the international importance and implications of weather modification activities by the United States;
<br>
<br>"(8) a review and analysis of present and past funding for weather modification from all sources to determine the sources and adequacy of funding in the light of the needs of the Nation;

<br>
<br>"(b) Findings.—Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>"(1) the sale of illegal cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products significantly reduces Federal, State, and local government revenues, with Internet sales alone accounting for billions of dollars of lost Federal, State, and local tobacco tax revenue each year;
<br>
<br>"(2) Hezbollah, Hamas, al Qaeda, and other terrorist organizations have profited from trafficking in illegal cigarettes or counterfeit cigarette tax stamps;
<br>
<br>"(3) terrorist involvement in illicit cigarette trafficking will continue to grow because of the large profits such organizations can earn;
<br>
<br>"(4) the sale of illegal cigarettes and smokeless tobacco over the Internet, and through mail, fax, or phone orders, makes it cheaper and easier for children to obtain tobacco products;
<br>
<br>"(5) the majority of Internet and other remote sales of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are being made without adequate precautions to protect against sales to children, without the payment of applicable taxes, and without complying with the nominal registration and reporting requirements in existing Federal law;
<br>
<br>"(6) unfair competition from illegal sales of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco is taking billions of dollars of sales away from law-abiding retailers throughout the United States;
<br>
<br>"(7) with rising State and local tobacco tax rates, the incentives for the illegal sale of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco have increased;
<br>
<br>"(8) the number of active tobacco investigations being conducted by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives rose to 452 in 2005;
<br>
<br>"(9) the number of Internet vendors in the United States and in foreign countries that sell cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to buyers in the United States increased from only about 40 in 2000 to more than 500 in 2005; and
<br>
<br>"(10) the intrastate sale of illegal cigarettes and smokeless tobacco over the Internet has a substantial effect on interstate commerce.
<br>
<br>"(c) Purposes.—It is the purpose of this Act [see Short Title of 2010 Amendment note above] to—
<br>
<br>"(1) require Internet and other remote sellers of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to comply with the same laws that apply to law-abiding tobacco retailers;
<br>
<br>"(2) create strong disincentives to illegal smuggling of tobacco products;
<br>
<br>"(3) provide government enforcement officials with more effective enforcement tools to combat tobacco smuggling;
<br>
<br>"(4) make it more difficult for cigarette and smokeless tobacco traffickers to engage in and profit from their illegal activities;
<br>
<br>"(5) increase collections of Federal, State, and local excise taxes on cigarettes and smokeless tobacco; and
<br>
<br>"(6) prevent and reduce youth access to inexpensive cigarettes and smokeless tobacco through illegal Internet or contraband sales."

<br>"(5) any State or local government authority to bring enforcement actions against persons located in Indian country.
<br>
<br>"(b) Coordination of Law Enforcement.—Nothing in this Act or the amendments made by this Act shall be construed to inhibit or otherwise affect any coordinated law enforcement effort by 1 or more States or other jurisdictions, including Indian tribes, through interstate compact or otherwise, that—
