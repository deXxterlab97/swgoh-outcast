L. 106–280, §2, Oct. 6, 2000, 114 Stat. 846, provided that: "In this Act [see Short Title of 2000 Amendments note set out under section 2151 of this title], the term 'appropriate committees of Congress' means the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on International Relations [now Committee on Foreign Affairs] of the House of Representatives."
<br>Part II—Military Assistance
<br>§2311. General authority
<br>(a) Defense articles and services; noncombatant personnel; transfer of funds
<br>
<br>The President is authorized to furnish military assistance, on such terms and conditions as he may determine, to any friendly country or international organization, the assisting of which the President finds will strengthen the security of the United States and promote world peace and which is otherwise eligible to receive such assistance, by—
<br>
<br>(1) acquiring for any source and providing (by loan or grant) any defense article or defense service;
<br>
<br>(2) assigning or detailing members of the Armed Forces of the United States and other personnel of the Department of Defense to perform duties of a noncombatant nature; or
<br>
<br>(3) transferring such of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available under this part as the President may determine for assistance to a recipient country, to the account in which funds for the procurement of defense articles and defense services under section 21 and section 22 of the Arms Export Control Act [22 U.S.C. 2761 and 2762] have been deposited for such recipient, to be merged with such deposited funds, and to be used solely to meet obligations of the recipient for payment for sales under that Act [22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.].
<br>
<br>Sales which are wholly paid from funds transferred under paragraph (3) or from funds made available on a non-repayable basis under section 23 of the Arms Export Control Act [22 U.S.C. 2763] shall be priced to exclude the costs of salaries of members of the Armed Forces of the United States (other than the Coast Guard).
<br>(b) Terms and conditions
<br>
<br>In addition to such other terms and conditions as the President may determine pursuant to subsection (a), defense articles may be loaned thereunder only if—
<br>
<br>(1) there is a bona fide reason, other than the shortage of funds, for providing such articles on a loan basis rather than on a grant basis;
<br>
<br>(2) there is a reasonable expectation that such articles will be returned to the agency making the loan at the end of the loan period, unless the loan is then renewed;
<br>
<br>(3) the loan period is of fixed duration not exceeding five years, during which such article may be recalled for any reason by the United States;
<br>
<br>(4) the agency making the loan is reimbursed for the loan based on the amount charged to the appropriation for military assistance under subsection (c); and
<br>
<br>(5) the loan agreement provides that (A) if the defense article is damaged while on loan, the country or international organization to which it was loaned will reimburse the United States for the cost of restoring or replacing the defense article, and (B) if the defense article is lost or destroyed while on loan, the country or international organization to which it was loaned will pay to the United States an amount equal to the replacement cost (less any depreciation in the value) of the defense article.
<br>(c) Appropriation charges; exceptions
<br>
<br>(1) In the case of any loan of a defense article or defense service made under this section, there shall be a charge to the appropriation for military assistance for any fiscal year while the article or service is on loan in an amount based on—
<br>
<br>(A) the out-of-pocket expenses authorized to be incurred in connection with such loan during such fiscal year; and
<br>
<br>(B) the depreciation which occurs during such year while such article is on loan.
<br>
<br>(2) The provisions of this subsection shall not apply—
<br>
<br>(A) to any particular defense article or defense service which the United States Government agreed, prior to December 17, 1973, to lend; and
<br>
<br>(B) to any defense article or defense service, or portion thereof, acquired with funds appropriated for military assistance under this chapter.

<br>§2314. Furnishing of defense articles or related training or other defense service on grant basis
<br>(a) Conditions of eligibility
<br>
<br>In addition to such other provisions as the President may require, no defense articles or related training or other defense service shall be furnished to any country on a grant basis unless it shall have agreed that—
<br>
<br>(1) it will not, without the consent of the President—
<br>
<br>(A) permit any use of such articles or related training or other defense service by anyone not an officer, employee, or agent of that country,
<br>
<br>(B) transfer, or permit any officer, employee, or agent of that country to transfer such articles or related training or other defense service by gift, sale, or otherwise, or
<br>
<br>(C) use or permit the use of such articles or related training or other defense service for purposes other than those for which furnished;
<br>
<br>(2) it will maintain the security of such articles or related training or other defense service, and will provide substantially the same degree of security protection afforded to such articles or related training or other defense service by the United States Government;
<br>
<br>(3) it will, as the President may require, permit continuous observation and review by, and furnish necessary information to, representatives of the United States Government with regard to the use of such articles or related training or other defense service; and
<br>
<br>(4) unless the President consents to other disposition, it will return to the United States Government for such use or disposition as the President considers in the best interests of the United States, such articles or related training or other defense service which are no longer needed for the purposes for which furnished.
<br>(b) Limitation on amount; exceptions
<br>
<br>No defense articles shall be furnished on a grant basis to any country at a cost in excess of $3,000,000 in any fiscal year unless the President determines—
<br>
<br>(1) that such country conforms to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations;
<br>
<br>(2) that such defense articles will be utilized by such country for the maintenance of its own defensive strength, or the defensive strength of the free world;
<br>
<br>(3) that such country is taking all reasonable measures, consistent with its political and economic stability, which may be needed to develop its defense capacities; and
<br>
<br>(4) that the increased ability of such country to defend itself is important to the security of the United States.
<br>(c) Reduction and termination of grants to countries able to maintain adequate military forces without undue economic strain
<br>
<br>The President shall regularly reduce and, with such deliberate speed as orderly procedure and other relevant considerations, including prior commitments, will permit, shall terminate all further grants of military equipment and supplies to any country having sufficient wealth to enable it, in the judgment of the President, to maintain and equip its own military forces at adequate strength, without undue burden to its economy.
<br>(d) Termination of assistance; report of violation by President; conditions for reinstatement
<br>
<br>(1) Assistance and deliveries of assistance under this part to any country shall be terminated as hereinafter provided, if such country uses defense articles or defense services furnished under this chapter, the Mutual Security Act of 1954, or any predecessor Foreign Assistance Act, in substantial violation (either in terms of quantities or in terms of the gravity of the consequences regardless of the quantities involved) of any agreement entered into pursuant to any such Act (A) by using such articles or services for a purpose not authorized under section 2302 of this title or, if such agreement provides that such articles or services may only be used for purposes more limited than those authorized under section 2302 of this title, for a purpose not authorized under such agreement; (B) by transferring such articles or services to, or permitting any use of such articles or services by, anyone not an officer, employee, or agent of the recipient country without the consent of the President; or (C) by failing to maintain the security of such articles or services.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) Assistance and deliveries of assistance shall be terminated pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection if the President so determines and so states in writing to the Congress, or if the Congress so finds by joint resolution.
<br>
<br>(B) The President shall report to the Congress promptly upon the receipt of information that a violation described in paragraph (1) of this subsection may have occurred.
<br>
<br>(3) Assistance to a country shall remain terminated in accordance with paragraph (1) of this subsection until such time as—
<br>
<br>(A) the President determines that the violation has ceased; and
<br>
<br>(B) the country concerned has given assurances satisfactory to the President that such violation will not recur.
<br>
<br>(4) The authority contained in section 2364(a) of this title may not be used to waive the provisions of this section with respect to further assistance under this part.
<br>(e) Consent by President to transfer
<br>
<br>In considering a request for approval of any transfer of any weapon, weapons system, munitions, aircraft, military boat, military vessel, or other implement of war to another country, the President shall not give his consent under subsection (a)(1) or (a)(4) to the transfer unless the United States itself would transfer the defense article under consideration to that country. In addition, the President shall not give his consent under subsection (a)(1) or (a)(4) to the transfer of any significant defense articles on the United States Munitions List unless the foreign country requesting consent to transfer agrees to demilitarize such defense articles prior to transfer, or the proposed recipient foreign country provides a commitment in writing to the United States Government that it will not transfer such defense articles, if not demilitarized, to any other foreign country or person without first obtaining the consent of the President.
<br>(f) Disposition of defense articles furnished on a grant basis; net proceeds to be paid over to the United States
<br>
<br>Effective July 1, 1974, no defense article shall be furnished to any country on a grant basis unless such country shall have agreed that the net proceeds of sale received by such country in disposing of any weapon, weapons system, munition, aircraft, military boat, military vessel, or other implement of war received under this part will be paid to the United States Government and shall be available to pay all official costs of the United States Government payable in the currency of that country, including all costs relating to the financing of international educational and cultural exchange activities in which that country participates under the programs authorized by the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961 [22 U.S.C. 2451 et seq.]. In the case of items which were delivered prior to 1985, the President may waive the requirement that such net proceeds be paid to the United States Government if he determines that to do so is in the national interest of the United States.
<br>(g) Discrimination on basis of race, religion, national origin, or sex prohibited
<br>
<br>(1) It is the policy of the United States that no assistance under this part should be furnished to any foreign country, the laws, regulations, official policies, or governmental practices of which prevent any United States person (as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of title 26) from participating in the furnishing of defense articles or defense services under this part on the basis of race, religion, national origin, or sex.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) No agency performing functions under this part shall, in employing or assigning personnel to participate in the performance of any such function, whether in the United States or abroad, take into account the exclusionary policies or practices of any foreign government where such policies or practices are based upon race, religion, national origin, or sex.
<br>
<br>(B) Each contract entered into by any such agency for the performance of any function under this part shall contain a provision to the effect that no person, partnership, corporation, or other entity performing functions pursuant to such contract, shall, in employing or assigning personnel to participate in the performance of any such function, whether in the United States or abroad, take into account the exclusionary policies or practices of any foreign government where such policies or practices are based upon race, religion, national origin, or sex.
<br>
<br>(3) The President shall promptly transmit reports to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate concerning any transaction in which any United States person (as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of title 26) is prevented by a foreign government on the basis of race, religion, national origin, or sex, from participating in the furnishing of assistance under this part, or education and training under part V of this subchapter, to any foreign country.

<br>

<br>
<br>(i) all the available information about the exclusionary policies or practices of the government of such country when such policies or practices are based upon race, religion, national origin, or sex and prevent any such person from participating in a transaction involving the furnishing of any assistance under this part or any education and training under part V of this subchapter;

<br>
<br>(iv) such other information as such committee may request.
