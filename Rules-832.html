<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>1948 Act
<br>
<br>Based on sections 548 and 549 of title 18, and sections 212, 213, 215, 217, 218 of title 25, Indians, U.S. Code, 1940 ed. (R.S. §§2142, 2143, 2144, 2145, 2146; Feb. 18, 1875, ch. 80, §1, 18 Stat. 318; Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §§328, 329, 35 Stat. 1151; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §291, 36 Stat. 1167; June 28, 1932, ch. 284, 47 Stat. 337).
<br>
<br>This section consolidates numerous conflicting and inconsistent provisions of law into a concise statement of the applicable law.
<br>
<br>R.S. §§2145, 2146 (U.S.C., title 25, §§217, 218) extended to the Indian country with notable exceptions the criminal laws of the United States applicable to places within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States. Crimes of Indians against Indians, and crimes punishable by tribal law were excluded.
<br>
<br>The confusion was not lessened by the cases of U.S. v. McBratney, 104 U.S. 622 and Draper v. U.S., 17 S.Ct. 107, holding that crimes in Indian country by persons not Indians are not cognizable by Federal courts in absence of reservation or cession of exclusive jurisdiction applicable to places within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States. Because of numerous statutes applicable only to Indians and prescribing punishment for crimes committed by Indians against Indians, "Indian country" was defined but once. (See act June 30, 1834, ch. 161, §1, 4, Stat. 729, which was later repealed.)
<br>
<br>Definition is based on latest construction of the term by the United States Supreme Court in U.S. v. McGowan, 58 S.Ct. 286, 302 U.S. 535, following U.S. v. Sandoval, 34 S.Ct. 1, 5, 231 U.S. 28, 46. (See also Donnelly v. U.S., 33 S.Ct. 449, 228 U.S. 243; and Kills Plenty v. U.S., 133 F.2d 292, certiorari denied, 1943, 63 S.Ct. 1172). (See reviser's note under section 1153 of this title.)
<br>
<br>Indian allotments were included in the definition on authority of the case of U.S. v. Pelican, 1913, 34 S.Ct. 396, 232 U.S. 442, 58 L.Ed. 676.
<br>1949 Act
<br>
<br>This section [section 25], by adding to section 1151 of title 18, U.S.C., the phrase "except as otherwise provided in sections 1154 and 1156 of this title", incorporates in this section the limitations of the term "Indian country" which are added to sections 1154 and 1156 by sections 27 and 28 of this bill.

<br>§1152. Laws governing
<br>
<br>Except as otherwise expressly provided by law, the general laws of the United States as to the punishment of offenses committed in any place within the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, except the District of Columbia, shall extend to the Indian country.
<br>
<br>This section shall not extend to offenses committed by one Indian against the person or property of another Indian, nor to any Indian committing any offense in the Indian country who has been punished by the local law of the tribe, or to any case where, by treaty stipulations, the exclusive jurisdiction over such offenses is or may be secured to the Indian tribes respectively.

<br>

<br>§1153. Offenses committed within Indian country
<br>
<br>(a) Any Indian who commits against the person or property of another Indian or other person any of the following offenses, namely, murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, maiming, a felony under chapter 109A, incest, a felony assault under section 113, an assault against an individual who has not attained the age of 16 years, felony child abuse or neglect, arson, burglary, robbery, and a felony under section 661 of this title within the Indian country, shall be subject to the same law and penalties as all other persons committing any of the above offenses, within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States.
<br>
<br>(b) Any offense referred to in subsection (a) of this section that is not defined and punished by Federal law in force within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States shall be defined and punished in accordance with the laws of the State in which such offense was committed as are in force at the time of such offense.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>1948 Act
<br>
<br>Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§548, 549 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §§328, 329, 35 Stat. 1151; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §291, 36 Stat. 1167; June 28, 1932, ch. 284, 47 Stat. 337).
<br>
<br>Section consolidates said sections 548 and 549 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed. Section 548 of said title covered 10 crimes. Section 549 of said title covered the same except robbery and incest.
<br>
<br>The 1932 amendment of section 548 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., constituting the last paragraph of the section, is omitted and section 549 of said title to which it applied likewise is omitted. The revised section therefore suffices to cover prosecution of the specific offenses committed on all reservations as intended by Congress.
<br>
<br>Words "Indian country" were substituted for language relating to jurisdiction extending to reservations and rights-of-way, in view of definitive section 1151 of this title.
<br>
<br>Paul W. Hyatt, president, board of commissioners, Idaho State Bar, recommended that said section 548 be considered with other sections in title 25, Indians, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and revised to insure certainty as to questions of jurisdiction, and punishment on conviction. Insofar as the recommendation came within the scope of this revision, it was followed.
<br>
<br>The proviso in said section 548 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which provided that rape should be defined in accordance with the laws of the State in which the offense was committed, was changed to include burglary so as to clarify the punishment for that offense.
<br>
<br>Venue provisions of said section 548 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in section 3242 of this title.
<br>
<br>Section 549 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., conferred special jurisdiction on the United States District Court for South Dakota of all crimes of murder, manslaughter, rape, assault with intent to kill, assault with a dangerous weapon, arson, burglary, and larceny committed within the limits of any Indian reservation within the State, whether by or against Indians or non-Indians. The Act of February 2, 1903, 32 Stat. 793, from which said section 549 was derived, accepted the cession by South Dakota of such jurisdiction.
<br>
<br>The effect of revised sections 1151, 1152, and 1153 of this title is to deprive the United States District Court for the District of South Dakota of jurisdiction of offenses on Indian reservations committed by non-Indians against non-Indians and to restore such jurisdiction to the courts of the State of South Dakota as in other States. This reflects the views of the United States attorney, George Philip, of the district of South Dakota.
<br>
<br>Minor changes were made in translation and phraseology.
<br>1949 Act
<br>
<br>This section [section 26] removes an ambiguity in section 1153 of title 18, U.S.C., by eliminating the provision that the crime of rape in the Indian country is to be punished in accordance with the law of the State where the offense was committed, leaving the definition of the offense to be determined by State law, but providing that punishment of rape of an Indian by an Indian is to be by imprisonment at the discretion of the court. The offense of rape, other than rape of an Indian by an Indian within the Indian country, is covered by section 2031 of title 18, U.S.C., and the offense of burglary by sections 1152 and 3242 of such title.
<br>
<br>Editorial Notes
<br>Amendments
<br>
<br>2013—Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 113–4 substituted "a felony assault under section 113" for "assault with intent to commit murder, assault with a dangerous weapon, assault resulting in serious bodily injury (as defined in section 1365 of this title)".
<br>
<br>2006—Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 109–248 inserted "felony child abuse or neglect," after "years,".
<br>
<br>1994—Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 103–322 substituted "kidnapping" for "kidnaping" and inserted "(as defined in section 1365 of this title), an assault against an individual who has not attained the age of 16 years" after "serious bodily injury".
<br>
<br>1988—Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 100–690 substituted "maiming, a felony under chapter 109A, incest" for " 'maiming' and all that follows through 'incest' ", thus clarifying execution of amendment by Pub. L. 99–646 and Pub. L. 99–654 but resulting in no change in text. See 1986 Amendment note below.
<br>
<br>1986—Pub. L. 99–646 and Pub. L. 99–654 which directed that section be amended identically by substituting in first par. "a felony under chapter 109A," for "rape, involuntary sodomy, carnal knowledge of any female, not his wife, who has not attained the age of sixteen years, assault with intent to commit rape," and by striking out in second and third pars. ", involuntary sodomy," was executed by making the substitution in subsec. (a) for "rape, involuntary sodomy, felonious sexual molestation of a minor, carnal knowledge of any female, not his wife, who has not attained the age of sixteen years, assault with intent to commit rape," to reflect the probable intent of Congress in view of prior amendment of this section by Pub. L. 99–303, but amendment to second and third pars. could not be executed because such pars. were struck out by Pub. L. 99–303.
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 99–303 inserted section catchline which had been eliminated by general amendment by section 1009 of Pub. L. 98–473, designated first par. as subsec. (a) and inserted "felonious sexual molestation of a minor,", struck out second par. which provided that, as used in this section, the offenses of burglary, involuntary sodomy, and incest be defined and punished in accordance with the laws of the State in which such offense was committed as are in force at the time of such offense, and struck out third par. and restated the provisions thereof in a new subsec.

<br>§1154. Intoxicants dispensed in Indian country
<br>
<br>(a) Whoever sells, gives away, disposes of, exchanges, or barters any malt, spirituous, or vinous liquor, including beer, ale, and wine, or any ardent or other intoxicating liquor of any kind whatsoever, except for scientific, sacramental, medicinal or mechanical purposes, or any essence, extract, bitters, preparation, compound, composition, or any article whatsoever, under any name, label, or brand, which produces intoxication, to any Indian to whom an allotment of land has been made while the title to the same shall be held in trust by the Government, or to any Indian who is a ward of the Government under charge of any Indian superintendent, or to any Indian, including mixed bloods, over whom the Government, through its departments, exercises guardianship, and whoever introduces or attempts to introduce any malt, spirituous, or vinous liquor, including beer, ale, and wine, or any ardent or intoxicating liquor of any kind whatsoever into the Indian country, shall, for the first offense, be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both; and, for each subsequent offense, be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.
<br>
<br>(b) It shall be a sufficient defense to any charge of introducing or attempting to introduce ardent spirits, ale, beer, wine, or intoxicating liquors into the Indian country that the acts charged were done under authority, in writing, from the Department of the Army or any officer duly authorized thereunto by the Department of the Army, but this subsection shall not bar the prosecution of any officer, soldier, sutler or storekeeper, attaché, or employee of the Army of the United States who barters, donates, or furnishes in any manner whatsoever liquors, beer, or any intoxicating beverage whatsoever to any Indian.

<br>(c) The term "Indian country" as used in this section does not include fee-patented lands in non-Indian communities or rights-of-way through Indian reservations, and this section does not apply to such lands or rights-of-way in the absence of a treaty or statute extending the Indian liquor laws thereto.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>1948 Act
<br>
<br>Based on sections 241, 242, 244a, 249, 254 of title 25, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians (R.S. §2139; Feb. 27, 1877, ch. 69, §1, 19 Stat. 244; July 4, 1884, ch. 180, §1, 23 Stat. 94; July 23, 1892, ch. 234, 27 Stat. 260; Mar. 2, 1917, ch. 146, §17, 39 Stat. 983; June 13, 1932, ch. 245, 47 Stat. 302; Mar. 5, 1934, ch. 43, 48 Stat. 396; June 27, 1934, ch. 846, 48 Stat. 1245; June 15, 1938, ch. 435, §1, 52 Stat. 696).
<br>
<br>Section consolidates sections 241, 242, 244a, and 249 of title 25, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians. The portion of section 241 of said title which defined the substantive offense became subsection (a); the portion relating to the scope of the term "Indian country" was omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of "Indian country" in section 1151 of this title; the portion of section 241 of said title excepting liquors introduced by the War Department became subsection (c), as limited by section 249 of said title; the portion respecting making complaint in county of offense, and with reference to arraignment, was omitted as covered by rule 5 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure; and the remainder of section 241 of said title was incorporated in section 1156 of this title.
<br>
<br>Section 254 of title 25, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians, was omitted as covered by this section and section 1156 of this title. That section was enacted in 1934 and excluded from the Indian liquor laws lands outside reservations where the land was no longer held by Indians under a trust patent or a deed or patent containing restrictions against alienation. Such enactment was prior to the June 15, 1938, amendment of section 241 of title 25, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians, in which the term "Indian country" was defined as including allotments where the title was held in trust by the Government or where it was inalienable without the consent of the United States. This provision, by implication, excluded cases where there was no trust or restriction on alienation and thereby achieved the same result as section 254 of title 25, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians. That amendment also repealed the act of Jan. 30, 1897, referred to in section 254 of title 25, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians. Insofar as the reference in section 254 of said title to "special Indian liquor laws" included section 244 of title 25, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians, the definition of Indian country in section 1151 of this title covers section 254 of title 25, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians.
<br>
<br>Words "or agent" were deleted as there have been no Indian agents since 1908. See section 64 of title 25, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians, and note thereunder.
<br>
<br>Mandatory punishment provisions were rephrased in the alternative and provision for commitment for nonpayment of fine was deleted. This change was also recommended by United States District Judge T. Blake Kennedy on the ground that, otherwise, section would be practically meaningless since, in most cases, offenders cannot pay a fine.
<br>
<br>The exception of intoxicating liquor for scientific, sacramental, medicinal or mechanical purposes was inserted for the same reason that makes this exception appropriate to section 1262 of this title.
<br>
<br>Minor changes were made in phraseology.
<br>1949 Act
<br>
<br>Subsection (a) of this section [section 27(a)] substitutes "Department of the Army" for "War Department", in subsection (b) of section 1154 of title 18, U.S.C., to conform to such redesignation by act July 26, 1947 (ch. 343, title 11, §205(a), 61 Stat. 501 (5 U.S.C., 1946 ed., §181–1)). Subsection (b) of this section [section 27(b)] adds subsection (c) to such section 1154 in order to conform it and section 1156 more closely to the laws relating to intoxicating liquor in the Indian country as they have heretofore been construed.

<br>
<br>1949—Subsec. (b). Act May 24, 1949, §27(a), substituted "Department of the Army" for "War Department".

<br>§1155. Intoxicants dispensed on school site
<br>
<br>Whoever, on any tract of land in the former Indian country upon which is located any Indian school maintained by or under the supervision of the United States, manufactures, sells, gives away, or in any manner, or by any means furnishes to anyone, either for himself or another, any vinous, malt, or fermented liquors, or any other intoxicating drinks of any kind whatsoever, except for scientific, sacramental, medicinal or mechanical purposes, whether medicated or not, or who carries, or in any manner has carried, into such area any such liquors or drinks, or who shall be interested in such manufacture, sale, giving away, furnishing to anyone, or carrying into such area any of such liquors or drinks, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on sections 241a, 244a, of title 25, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians (Mar. 1, 1895, ch. 145, §8, 28 Stat. 697; Mar. 5, 1934, ch. 43, 48 Stat. 396.)
<br>
<br>Section consolidates sections 241a and 244a of title 25, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians. The effect of section 244a of said title in repealing section 241a of said title, except as to lands upon which Indian schools are maintained, was to continue prohibiting the dispensing of liquor in such areas.
<br>
<br>The words "upon conviction thereof" were omitted as unnecessary, since punishment cannot be imposed until a conviction is secured.
<br>
<br>The minimum punishment provision was omitted to conform to the policy adopted in revision of the 1909 Criminal Code.
<br>
<br>Mandatory punishment provision was rephrased in the alternative.
<br>
<br>The exception of intoxicating liquor for scientific, sacramental, medicinal or mechanical purposes was inserted for the same reason that makes this exception appropriate to section 1262 of this title.

<br>
<br>Whoever, except for scientific, sacramental, medicinal or mechanical purposes, possesses intoxicating liquors in the Indian country or where the introduction is prohibited by treaty or an Act of Congress, shall, for the first offense, be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both; and, for each subsequent offense, be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.
<br>
<br>The term "Indian country" as used in this section does not include fee-patented lands in non-Indian communities or rights-of-way through Indian reservations, and this section does not apply to such lands or rights-of-way in the absence of a treaty or statute extending the Indian liquor laws thereto.

<br>§1201. Kidnapping
<br>
<br>(a) Whoever unlawfully seizes, confines, inveigles, decoys, kidnaps, abducts, or carries away and holds for ransom or reward or otherwise any person, except in the case of a minor by the parent thereof, when—
<br>
<br>(1) the person is willfully transported in interstate or foreign commerce, regardless of whether the person was alive when transported across a State boundary, or the offender travels in interstate or foreign commerce or uses the mail or any means, facility, or instrumentality of interstate or foreign commerce in committing or in furtherance of the commission of the offense;
<br>
<br>(2) any such act against the person is done within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States;
<br>
<br>(3) any such act against the person is done within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States as defined in section 46501 of title 49;
<br>
<br>(4) the person is a foreign official, an internationally protected person, or an official guest as those terms are defined in section 1116(b) of this title; or
<br>
<br>(5) the person is among those officers and employees described in section 1114 of this title and any such act against the person is done while the person is engaged in, or on account of, the performance of official duties,
<br>
<br>shall be punished by imprisonment for any term of years or for life and, if the death of any person results, shall be punished by death or life imprisonment.
<br>
<br>(b) With respect to subsection (a)(1), above, the failure to release the victim within twenty-four hours after he shall have been unlawfully seized, confined, inveigled, decoyed, kidnapped, abducted, or carried away shall create a rebuttable presumption that such person has been transported in interstate or foreign commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the fact that the presumption under this section has not yet taken effect does not preclude a Federal investigation of a possible violation of this section before the 24-hour period has ended.

As used in this subsection, the United States includes all areas under the jurisdiction of the United States including any of the places within the provisions of sections 5 and 7 of this title and section 46501(2) of title 49. For purposes of this subsection, the term "national of the United States" has the meaning prescribed in section 101(a)(22) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(22)).

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§408a, 408c (June 22, 1932, ch. 271, §§1, 3, 47 Stat. 326; May 18, 1934, ch. 301, 48 Stat. 781, 782).
<br>
<br>Section consolidates sections 408a and 408c of title 18 U.S.C., 1940 ed.
<br>
<br>Reference to persons aiding, abetting or causing was omitted as unnecessary because such persons are made principals by section 22 of this title.
<br>
<br>Words "upon conviction" were omitted as surplusage, because punishment cannot be imposed until a conviction is secured.
<br>
<br>Direction as to confinement "in the penitentiary" was omitted because of section 4082 of this title which commits all prisoners to the custody of the Attorney General. (See reviser's note under section 1 of this title.)
<br>
<br>The phrase "for any term of years or for life" was substituted for the words "for such term of years as the court in its discretion shall determine" which appeared in said section 408a of Title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed. This change was made in order to remove all doubt as to whether "term of years" includes life imprisonment.
<br>
<br>Minor changes were made in phraseology.
<br>
