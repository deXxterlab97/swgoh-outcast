<br>§1322a. Multiemployer plan benefits guaranteed
<br>(a) Benefits of covered plans subject to guarantee
<br>
<br>The corporation shall guarantee, in accordance with this section, the payment of all nonforfeitable benefits (other than benefits becoming nonforfeitable solely on account of the termination of a plan) under a multiemployer plan—
<br>
<br>(1) to which this subchapter applies, and
<br>
<br>(2) which is insolvent under section 1426(b) or 1441(d)(2) of this title.
<br>(b) Benefits or benefit increases not eligible for guarantee
<br>
<br>(1)(A) For purposes of this section, a benefit or benefit increase which has been in effect under a plan for less than 60 months is not eligible for the corporation's guarantee. For purposes of this paragraph, any month of any plan year during which the plan was insolvent or terminated (within the meaning of section 1341a(a)(2) of this title) shall not be taken into account.
<br>
<br>(B) For purposes of this section, a benefit or benefit increase which has been in effect under a plan for less than 60 months before the first day of the plan year for which an amendment reducing the benefit or the benefit increase is taken into account under section 1425(a)(2) 1 of this title in determining the minimum contribution requirement for the plan year under section 1423(b) 1 of this title is not eligible for the corporation's guarantee.
<br>
<br>(2) For purposes of this section—
<br>
<br>(A) the date on which a benefit or a benefit increase under a plan is first in effect is the later of—
<br>
<br>(i) the date on which the documents establishing or increasing the benefit were executed, or
<br>
<br>(ii) the effective date of the benefit or benefit increase;
<br>
<br>(B) the period of time for which a benefit or a benefit increase has been in effect under a successor plan includes the period of time for which the benefit or benefit increase was in effect under a previously established plan; and
<br>
<br>(C) in the case of a plan to which section 1321 of this title did not apply on September 3, 1974, the time periods referred to in this section are computed beginning on the date on which section 1321 of this title first applies to the plan.
<br>(c) Determinations respecting amount of guarantee
<br>
<br>(1) Except as provided in subsection (g), the monthly benefit of a participant or a beneficiary which is guaranteed under this section by the corporation with respect to a plan is the product of—
<br>
<br>(A) 100 percent of the accrual rate up to $11, plus 75 percent of the lesser of—
<br>
<br>(i) $33, or
<br>
<br>(ii) the accrual rate, if any, in excess of $11, and
<br>
<br>(B) the number of the participant's years of credited service.
<br>
<br>(2) For purposes of this section, the accrual rate is—
<br>
<br>(A) the monthly benefit of the participant or beneficiary which is described in subsection (a) and which is eligible for the corporation's guarantee under subsection (b), except that such benefit shall be—
<br>
<br>(i) no greater than the monthly benefit which would be payable under the plan at normal retirement age in the form of a single life annuity, and
<br>
<br>(ii) determined without regard to any reduction under section 411(a)(3)(E) of title 26; divided by
<br>
<br>(B) the participant's years of credited service.
<br>
<br>(3) For purposes of this subsection—
<br>
<br>(A) a year of credited service is a year in which the participant completed—
<br>
<br>(i) a full year of participation in the plan, or
<br>
<br>(ii) any period of service before participation which is credited for purposes of benefit accrual as the equivalent of a full year of participation;
<br>
<br>(B) any year for which the participant is credited for purposes of benefit accrual with a fraction of the equivalent of a full year of participation shall be counted as such a fraction of a year of credited service; and
<br>
<br>(C) years of credited service shall be determined by including service which may otherwise be disregarded by the plan under section 411(a)(3)(E) of title 26.
<br>
<br>(4) For purposes of subsection (a), in the case of a qualified preretirement survivor annuity (as defined in section 1055(e)(1) of this title) payable to the surviving spouse of a participant under a multiemployer plan which becomes insolvent under section 1426(b) of this title or 1441(d)(2) of this title or is terminated, such annuity shall not be treated as forfeitable solely because the participant has not died as of the date on which the plan became so insolvent or the termination date.
<br>(d) Amount of guarantee of reduced benefit
<br>
<br>In the case of a benefit which has been reduced under section 411(a)(3)(E) of title 26, the corporation shall guarantee the lesser of—
<br>
<br>(1) the reduced benefit, or
<br>
<br>(2) the amount determined under subsection (c).
<br>(e) Ineligibility of benefits for guarantee
<br>
<br>The corporation shall not guarantee benefits under a multiemployer plan which, under section 1322(b)(6) of this title, would not be guaranteed under a single-employer plan.
<br>(f) Study, report, etc., respecting premium increase in existing basic-benefit guarantee levels; Congressional procedures applicable for revision of schedules
<br>
<br>(1) No later than 5 years after September 26, 1980, and at least every fifth year thereafter, the corporation shall—
<br>
<br>(A) conduct a study to determine—
<br>
<br>(i) the premiums needed to maintain the basic-benefit guarantee levels for multiemployer plans described in subsection (c), and
<br>
<br>(ii) whether the basic-benefit guarantee levels for multiemployer plans may be increased without increasing the basic-benefit premiums for multiemployer plans under this subchapter; and
<br>
<br>(B) report such determinations to the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on Education and Labor of the House of Representatives and to the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Labor and Human Resources of the Senate.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) If the last report described in paragraph (1) indicates that a premium increase is necessary to support the existing basic-benefit guarantee levels for multiemployer plans, the corporation shall transmit to the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on Education and Labor of the House of Representatives and to the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Labor and Human Resources of the Senate by March 31 of any calendar year in which congressional action under this subsection is requested—
<br>
<br>(i) a revised schedule of basic-benefit guarantees for multiemployer plans which would be necessary in the absence of an increase in premiums approved in accordance with section 1306(b) of this title,
<br>
<br>(ii) a revised schedule of basic-benefit premiums for multiemployer plans which is necessary to support the existing basic-benefit guarantees for such plans, and
<br>
<br>(iii) a revised schedule of basic-benefit guarantees for multiemployer plans for which the schedule of premiums necessary is higher than the existing premium schedule for such plans but lower than the revised schedule of premiums for such plans specified in clause (ii), together with such schedule of premiums.
<br>
<br>(B) The revised schedule of increased premiums referred to in subparagraph (A)(ii) or (A)(iii) shall go into effect as approved by the enactment of a joint resolution.
<br>
<br>(C) If an increase in premiums is not so enacted, the revised guarantee schedule described in subparagraph (A)(i) shall go into effect on the first day of the second calendar year following the year in which such revised guarantee schedule was submitted to the Congress.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) If the last report described in paragraph (1) indicates that basic-benefit guarantees for multiemployer plans can be increased without increasing the basic-benefit premiums for multiemployer plans under this subchapter, the corporation shall submit to the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on Education and Labor of the House of Representatives and to the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Labor and Human Resources of the Senate by March 31 of the calendar year in which congressional action under this paragraph is requested—
<br>
<br>(i) a revised schedule of increases in the basic-benefit guarantees which can be supported by the existing schedule of basic-benefit premiums for multiemployer plans, and
<br>
<br>(ii) a revised schedule of basic-benefit premiums sufficient to support the existing basic-benefit guarantees.
<br>
<br>(B) The revised schedules referred to in subparagraph (A)(i) or subparagraph (A)(ii) shall go into effect as approved by the enactment of a joint resolution.
<br>
<br>(4)(A) The succeeding subparagraphs of this paragraph are enacted by the Congress as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate and the House of Representatives, respectively, and as such they shall be deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, but applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed in that House in the case of joint resolutions (as defined in subparagraph (B)). Such subparagraphs shall supersede other rules only to the extent that they are inconsistent therewith. They are enacted with full recognition of the constitutional right of either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, and to the same extent as in the case of any rule of that House.
<br>
<br>(B) For purposes of this subsection, "joint resolution" means only a joint resolution, the matter after the resolving clause of which is as follows: "The proposed schedule described in        transmitted to the Congress by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation on        is hereby approved.", the first blank space therein being filled with "section 4022A(f)(2)(A)(ii) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974", "section 4022A(f)(2)(A)(iii) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974", "section 4022A(f)(3)(A)(i) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974", or "section 4022A(f)(3)(A)(ii) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974" (whichever is applicable), and the second blank space therein being filled with the date on which the corporation's message proposing the revision was submitted.
<br>
<br>(C) The procedure for disposition of a joint resolution shall be the procedure described in section 1306(b)(4) through (7) of this title.
<br>(g) Guarantee of payment of other classes of benefits and establishment of terms and conditions of guarantee; promulgation of regulations for establishment of supplemental program to guarantee benefits otherwise ineligible; status of benefits; applicability of revised schedule of premiums
<br>
<br>(1) The corporation may guarantee the payment of such other classes of benefits under multiemployer plans, and establish the terms and conditions under which those other classes of benefits are guaranteed, as it determines to be appropriate.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) The corporation shall prescribe regulations to establish a supplemental program to guarantee benefits under multiemployer plans which would be guaranteed under this section but for the limitations in subsection (c). Such regulations shall be proposed by the corporation no later than the end of the 18th calendar month following September 26, 1980. The regulations shall make coverage under the supplemental program available no later than January 1, 1983. Any election to participate in the supplemental program shall be on a voluntary basis, and a plan electing such coverage shall continue to pay the premiums required under section 1306(a)(2)(B) of this title to the revolving fund used pursuant to section 1305 of this title in connection with benefits otherwise guaranteed under this section. Any such election shall be irrevocable, except to the extent otherwise provided by regulations prescribed by the corporation.
<br>
<br>(B) The regulations prescribed under this paragraph shall provide—
<br>
<br>(i) that a plan must elect coverage under the supplemental program within the time permitted by the regulations;
<br>
<br>(ii) unless the corporation determines otherwise, that a plan may not elect supplemental coverage unless the value of the assets of the plan as of the end of the plan year preceding the plan year in which the election must be made is an amount equal to 15 times the total amount of the benefit payments made under the plan for that year; and
<br>
<br>(iii) such other reasonable terms and conditions for supplemental coverage, including funding standards and any other reasonable limitations with respect to plans or benefits covered or to means of program financing, as the corporation determines are necessary and appropriate for a feasible supplemental program consistent with the purposes of this subchapter.
<br>
<br>(3) Any benefits guaranteed under this subsection shall be considered nonbasic benefits for purposes of this subchapter.
<br>
<br>(4)(A) No revised schedule of premiums under this subsection, after the initial schedule, shall go into effect unless—
<br>
<br>(i) the revised schedule is submitted to the Congress, and
<br>
<br>(ii) a joint resolution described in subparagraph (B) is not enacted before the close of the 60th legislative day after such schedule is submitted to the Congress.
<br>
<br>(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), a joint resolution described in this subparagraph is a joint resolution the matter after the resolving clause of which is as follows: "The revised premium schedule transmitted to the Congress by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation under section 4022A(g)(4) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 on          is hereby disapproved.", the blank space therein being filled with the date on which the revised schedule was submitted.
<br>
<br>(C) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term "legislative day" means any calendar day other than a day on which either House is not in session because of a sine die adjournment or an adjournment of more than 3 days to a day certain.
<br>
<br>(D) The procedure for disposition of a joint resolution described in subparagraph (B) shall be the procedure described in paragraphs (4) through (7) of section 1306(b) of this title.
<br>
<br>(5) Regulations prescribed by the corporation to carry out the provisions of this subsection, may, to the extent provided therein, supersede the requirements of sections 1426, 1431, and 1441 of this title, and the requirements of section 418E of title 26, but only with respect to benefits guaranteed under this subsection.
<br>(h) Applicability to nonforfeitable benefits accrued as of July 30, 1980; manner and extent of guarantee
<br>
<br>(1) Except as provided in paragraph (3), subsections (b) and (c) shall not apply with respect to the nonforfeitable benefits accrued as of July 29, 1980, with respect to a participant or beneficiary under a multiemployer plan—
<br>
<br>(1) 2 who is in pay status on July 29, 1980, or
<br>
<br>(2) 3 who is within 36 months of the normal retirement age and has a nonforfeitable right to a pension as of that date.
<br>
<br>(2) The benefits described in paragraph (1) shall be guaranteed by the corporation in the same manner and to the same extent as benefits are guaranteed by the corporation under section 1322 of this title (without regard to this section).
<br>
<br>(3) This subsection does not apply with respect to a plan for plan years following a plan year—
<br>
<br>(A) in which the plan has terminated within the meaning of section 1341a(a)(2) of this title, or
<br>
<br>(B) in which it is determined by the corporation that substantially all the employers have withdrawn from the plan pursuant to an agreement or arrangement to withdraw.

<br>Subtitle C—Terminations
<br>§1341. Termination of single-employer plans
<br>(a) General rules governing single-employer plan terminations
<br>(1) Exclusive means of plan termination
<br>
<br>Except in the case of a termination for which proceedings are otherwise instituted by the corporation as provided in section 1342 of this title, a single-employer plan may be terminated only in a standard termination under subsection (b) or a distress termination under subsection (c).
<br>(2) 60-day notice of intent to terminate
<br>
<br>Not less than 60 days before the proposed termination date of a standard termination under subsection (b) or a distress termination under subsection (c), the plan administrator shall provide to each affected party (other than the corporation in the case of a standard termination) a written notice of intent to terminate stating that such termination is intended and the proposed termination date. The written notice shall include any related additional information required in regulations of the corporation.
<br>(3) Adherence to collective bargaining agreements
<br>
<br>The corporation shall not proceed with a termination of a plan under this section if the termination would violate the terms and conditions of an existing collective bargaining agreement. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall be construed as limiting the authority of the corporation to institute proceedings to involuntarily terminate a plan under section 1342 of this title.
<br>(b) Standard termination of single-employer plans
<br>(1) General requirements
<br>
<br>A single-employer plan may terminate under a standard termination only if—
<br>
<br>(A) the plan administrator provides the 60-day advance notice of intent to terminate to affected parties required under subsection (a)(2),
<br>
<br>(B) the requirements of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (2) are met,
<br>
<br>(C) the corporation does not issue a notice of noncompliance under subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2), and
<br>
<br>(D) when the final distribution of assets occurs, the plan is sufficient for benefit liabilities (determined as of the termination date).
<br>(2) Termination procedure
<br>(A) Notice to the corporation
<br>
<br>As soon as practicable after the date on which the notice of intent to terminate is provided pursuant to subsection (a)(2), the plan administrator shall send a notice to the corporation setting forth—
<br>
<br>(i) certification by an enrolled actuary—
<br>
<br>(I) of the projected amount of the assets of the plan (as of a proposed date of final distribution of assets),
<br>
<br>(II) of the actuarial present value (as of such date) of the benefit liabilities (determined as of the proposed termination date) under the plan, and
<br>
<br>(III) that the plan is projected to be sufficient (as of such proposed date of final distribution) for such benefit liabilities,
<br>
<br>(ii) such information as the corporation may prescribe in regulations as necessary to enable the corporation to make determinations under subparagraph (C), and
<br>
<br>(iii) certification by the plan administrator that—
<br>
<br>(I) the information on which the enrolled actuary based the certification under clause (i) is accurate and complete, and
<br>
<br>(II) the information provided to the corporation under clause (ii) is accurate and complete.
<br>
<br>Clause (i) and clause (iii)(I) shall not apply to a plan described in section 412(i) 1 of title 26.
<br>(B) Notice to participants and beneficiaries of benefit commitments 2
<br>
<br>No later than the date on which a notice is sent by the plan administrator under subparagraph (A), the plan administrator shall send a notice to each person who is a participant or beneficiary under the plan—
<br>
<br>(i) specifying the amount of the benefit liabilities (if any) attributable to such person as of the proposed termination date and the benefit form on the basis of which such amount is determined, and
<br>
<br>(ii) including the following information used in determining such benefit liabilities:
<br>
<br>(I) the length of service,
<br>
<br>(II) the age of the participant or beneficiary,
<br>
<br>(III) wages,
<br>
<br>(IV) the assumptions, including the interest rate, and
<br>
<br>(V) such other information as the corporation may require.
<br>
<br>Such notice shall be written in such manner as is likely to be understood by the participant or beneficiary and as may be prescribed in regulations of the corporation.
<br>(C) Notice from the corporation of noncompliance
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>Within 60 days after receipt of the notice under subparagraph (A), the corporation shall issue a notice of noncompliance to the plan administrator if—
<br>
<br>(I) it determines, based on the notice sent under paragraph (2)(A) of subsection (b), that there is reason to believe that the plan is not sufficient for benefit liabilities,
<br>
<br>(II) it otherwise determines, on the basis of information provided by affected parties or otherwise obtained by the corporation, that there is reason to believe that the plan is not sufficient for benefit liabilities, or
<br>
<br>(III) it determines that any other requirement of subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph or of subsection (a)(2) has not been met, unless it further determines that the issuance of such notice would be inconsistent with the interests of participants and beneficiaries.
<br>(ii) Extension
<br>
<br>The corporation and the plan administrator may agree to extend the 60-day period referred to in clause (i) by a written agreement signed by the corporation and the plan administrator before the expiration of the 60-day period. The 60-day period shall be extended as provided in the agreement and may be further extended by subsequent written agreements signed by the corporation and the plan administrator made before the expiration of a previously agreed upon extension of the 60-day period. Any extension may be made upon such terms and conditions (including the payment of benefits) as are agreed upon by the corporation and the plan administrator.
<br>(D) Final distribution of assets in absence of notice of noncompliance
<br>
<br>The plan administrator shall commence the final distribution of assets pursuant to the standard termination of the plan as soon as practicable after the expiration of the 60-day (or extended) period referred to in subparagraph (C), but such final distribution may occur only if—
<br>
<br>(i) the plan administrator has not received during such period a notice of noncompliance from the corporation under subparagraph (C), and
<br>
<br>(ii) when such final distribution occurs, the plan is sufficient for benefit liabilities (determined as of the termination date).
<br>(3) Methods of final distribution of assets
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>In connection with any final distribution of assets pursuant to the standard termination of the plan under this subsection, the plan administrator shall distribute the assets in accordance with section 1344 of this title. In distributing such assets, the plan administrator shall—
<br>
<br>(i) purchase irrevocable commitments from an insurer to provide all benefit liabilities under the plan, or
<br>
<br>(ii) in accordance with the provisions of the plan and any applicable regulations, otherwise fully provide all benefit liabilities under the plan. A transfer of assets to the corporation in accordance with section 1350 of this title on behalf of a missing participant shall satisfy this subparagraph with respect to such participant.
<br>(B) Certification to the corporation of final distribution of assets
<br>
<br>Within 30 days after the final distribution of assets is completed pursuant to the standard termination of the plan under this subsection, the plan administrator shall send a notice to the corporation certifying that the assets of the plan have been distributed in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (A) so as to pay all benefit liabilities under the plan.
<br>(4) Continuing authority
<br>
<br>Nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude the continued exercise by the corporation, after the termination date of a plan terminated in a standard termination under this subsection, of its authority under section 1303 of this title with respect to matters relating to the termination. A certification under paragraph (3)(B) shall not affect the corporation's obligations under section 1322 of this title.
<br>(5) Special rule for certain plans where cessation or change in membership of a controlled group
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (D), if—
<br>
<br>(i) there is 3 transaction or series of transactions which result in a person ceasing to be a member of a controlled group, and
<br>
<br>(ii) such person immediately before the transaction or series of transactions maintained a single-employer plan which is a defined benefit plan which is fully funded,
<br>
<br>then the interest rate used in determining whether the plan is sufficient for benefit liabilities or to otherwise assess plan liabilities for purposes of this subsection or section 1342(a)(4) of this title shall be not less than the interest rate used in determining whether the plan is fully funded.
<br>(B) Limitations
<br>
<br>Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to any transaction or series of transactions unless—
<br>
<br>(i) any employer maintaining the plan immediately before or after such transaction or series of transactions—
<br>
<br>(I) has an outstanding senior unsecured debt instrument which is rated investment grade by each of the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations for corporate bonds that has issued a credit rating for such instrument, or
<br>
<br>(II) if no such debt instrument of such employer has been rated by such an organization but 1 or more of such organizations has made an issuer credit rating for such employer, all such organizations which have so rated the employer have rated such employer investment grade, and
<br>
<br>(ii) the employer maintaining the plan after the transaction or series of transactions employs at least 20 percent of the employees located in the United States who were employed by such employer immediately before the transaction or series of transactions.
<br>(C) Fully funded
<br>
<br>For purposes of subparagraph (A), a plan shall be treated as fully funded with respect to any transaction or series of transactions if—
<br>
<br>(i) in the case of a transaction or series of transactions which occur in a plan year beginning before January 1, 2008, the funded current liability percentage determined under section 1082(d) of this title for the plan year is at least 100 percent, and
<br>
<br>(ii) in the case of a transaction or series of transactions which occur in a plan year beginning on or after such date, the funding target attainment percentage determined under section 1083 of this title is, as of the valuation date for such plan year, at least 100 percent.
<br>(D) 2 year limitation
<br>
<br>Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to any transaction or series of transactions if the plan referred to in subparagraph (A)(ii) is terminated under subsection (c) or section 1342 of this title after the close of the 2-year period beginning on the date on which the first such transaction occurs.
<br>(c) Distress termination of single-employer plans
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>A single-employer plan may terminate under a distress termination only if—
<br>
<br>(A) the plan administrator provides the 60-day advance notice of intent to terminate to affected parties required under subsection (a)(2),
<br>
<br>(B) the requirements of subparagraph (A) of paragraph (2) are met, and
<br>
<br>(C) the corporation determines that the requirements of subparagraphs (B) and (D) of paragraph (2) are met.
<br>(2) Termination requirements
<br>(A) Information submitted to the corporation
<br>
<br>As soon as practicable after the date on which the notice of intent to terminate is provided pursuant to subsection (a)(2), the plan administrator shall provide the corporation, in such form as may be prescribed by the corporation in regulations, the following information:
<br>
<br>(i) such information as the corporation may prescribe by regulation as necessary to make determinations under subparagraph (B) and paragraph (3);
<br>

<br>(II) the actuarial present value (as of such dates) of the benefit liabilities under the plan,

<br>(III) whether the plan is sufficient for benefit liabilities as of such dates,
<br>
<br>(IV) the actuarial present value (as of such dates) of benefits under the plan guaranteed under section 1322 of this title, and
<br>
<br>(V) whether the plan is sufficient for guaranteed benefits as of such dates;
<br>
<br>(iii) in any case in which the plan is not sufficient for benefit liabilities as of such date—
<br>
<br>(I) the name and address of each participant and beneficiary under the plan as of such date, and
<br>
<br>(II) such other information as shall be prescribed by the corporation by regulation as necessary to enable the corporation to be able to make payments to participants and beneficiaries as required under section 1322(c) of this title; and
<br>
<br>(iv) certification by the plan administrator that—
<br>
<br>(I) the information on which the enrolled actuary based the certifications under clause (ii) is accurate and complete, and

<br>(B) Determination by the corporation of necessary distress criteria
<br>
<br>Upon receipt of the notice of intent to terminate required under subsection (a)(2) and the information required under subparagraph (A), the corporation shall determine whether the requirements of this subparagraph are met as provided in clause (i), (ii), or (iii).

<br>(i) Liquidation in bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings
<br>
<br>The requirements of this clause are met by a person if—
<br>
<br>(I) such person has filed or has had filed against such person, as of the proposed termination date, a petition seeking liquidation in a case under title 11 or under any similar Federal law or law of a State or political subdivision of a State (or a case described in clause (ii) filed by or against such person has been converted, as of such date, to a case in which liquidation is sought), and
<br>
<br>(II) such case has not, as of the proposed termination date, been dismissed.
<br>(ii) Reorganization in bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings

<br>
<br>(II) such case has not, as of the proposed termination date, been dismissed,
<br>
<br>(III) such person timely submits to the corporation any request for the approval of the bankruptcy court (or other appropriate court in a case under such similar law of a State or political subdivision) of the plan termination, and
<br>
<br>(IV) the bankruptcy court (or such other appropriate court) determines that, unless the plan is terminated, such person will be unable to pay all its debts pursuant to a plan of reorganization and will be unable to continue in business outside the chapter 11 reorganization process and approves the termination.

<br>
<br>The requirements of this clause are met by a person if such person demonstrates to the satisfaction of the corporation that—

<br>(I) unless a distress termination occurs, such person will be unable to pay such person's debts when due and will be unable to continue in business, or
<br>
<br>(II) the costs of providing pension coverage have become unreasonably burdensome to such person, solely as a result of a decline of such person's workforce covered as participants under all single-employer plans of which such person is a contributing sponsor.
<br>(C) Notification of determinations by the corporation
<br>
<br>The corporation shall notify the plan administrator as soon as practicable of its determinations made pursuant to subparagraph (B).

<br>
<br>A plan administrator that has filed a notice of intent to terminate under subsection (a)(2) shall provide to an affected party any information provided to the corporation under subparagraph (A) or the regulations under subsection (a)(2) not later than 15 days after—
<br>
<br>(I) receipt of a request from the affected party for the information; or
<br>
<br>(II) the provision of new information to the corporation relating to a previous request.
<br>(ii) Confidentiality
<br>(I) In general
<br>
<br>The plan administrator shall not provide information under clause (i) in a form that includes any information that may directly or indirectly be associated with, or otherwise identify, an individual participant or beneficiary.
<br>(II) Limitation
<br>
<br>A court may limit disclosure under this subparagraph of confidential information described in section 552(b) of title 5 to any authorized representative of the participants or beneficiaries that agrees to ensure the confidentiality of such information.
<br>(iii) Form and manner of information; charges
<br>(I) Form and manner
<br>
<br>The corporation may prescribe the form and manner of the provision of information under this subparagraph, which shall include delivery in written, electronic, or other appropriate form to the extent that such form is reasonably accessible to individuals to whom the information is required to be provided.
<br>(II) Reasonable charges
<br>
<br>A plan administrator may charge a reasonable fee for any information provided under this subparagraph in other than electronic form.
<br>(iv) Authorized representative
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subparagraph, the term "authorized representative" means any employee organization representing participants in the pension plan.
<br>(3) Termination procedure
<br>(A) Determinations by the corporation relating to plan sufficiency for guaranteed benefits and for benefit liabilities
<br>
<br>If the corporation determines that the requirements for a distress termination set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2) are met, the corporation shall—
<br>
<br>(i) determine that the plan is sufficient for guaranteed benefits (as of the termination date) or that the corporation is unable to make such determination on the basis of information made available to the corporation,
<br>
<br>(ii) determine that the plan is sufficient for benefit liabilities (as of the termination date) or that the corporation is unable to make such determination on the basis of information made available to the corporation, and
<br>
<br>(iii) notify the plan administrator of the determinations made pursuant to this subparagraph as soon as practicable.
<br>(B) Implementation of termination
<br>
<br>After the corporation notifies the plan administrator of its determinations under subparagraph (A), the termination of the plan shall be carried out as soon as practicable, as provided in clause (i), (ii), or (iii).
<br>(i) Cases of sufficiency for benefit liabilities
<br>
<br>In any case in which the corporation determines that the plan is sufficient for benefit liabilities, the plan administrator shall proceed to distribute the plan's assets, and make certification to the corporation with respect to such distribution, in the manner described in subsection (b)(3), and shall take such other actions as may be appropriate to carry out the termination of the plan.
<br>(ii) Cases of sufficiency for guaranteed benefits without a finding of sufficiency for benefit liabilities
<br>
<br>In any case in which the corporation determines that the plan is sufficient for guaranteed benefits, but further determines that it is unable to determine that the plan is sufficient for benefit liabilities on the basis of the information made available to it, the plan administrator shall proceed to distribute the plan's assets in the manner described in subsection (b)(3), make certification to the corporation that the distribution has occurred, and take such actions as may be appropriate to carry out the termination of the plan.
<br>(iii) Cases without any finding of sufficiency
<br>
<br>In any case in which the corporation determines that it is unable to determine that the plan is sufficient for guaranteed benefits on the basis of the information made available to it, the corporation shall commence proceedings in accordance with section 1342 of this title.
<br>(C) Finding after authorized commencement of termination that plan is unable to pay benefits
<br>(i) Finding with respect to benefit liabilities which are not guaranteed benefits
<br>
<br>If, after the plan administrator has begun to terminate the plan as authorized under subparagraph (B)(i), the plan administrator finds that the plan is unable, or will be unable, to pay benefit liabilities which are not benefits guaranteed by the corporation under section 1322 of this title, the plan administrator shall notify the corporation of such finding as soon as practicable thereafter.
<br>(ii) Finding with respect to guaranteed benefits
<br>
<br>If, after the plan administrator has begun to terminate the plan as authorized by subparagraph (B)(i) or (ii), the plan administrator finds that the plan is unable, or will be unable, to pay all benefits under the plan which are guaranteed by the corporation under section 1322 of this title, the plan administrator shall notify the corporation of such finding as soon as practicable thereafter. If the corporation concurs in the finding of the plan administrator (or the corporation itself makes such a finding), the corporation shall institute appropriate proceedings under section 1342 of this title.
<br>(D) Administration of the plan during interim period
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>The plan administrator shall—
<br>
<br>(I) meet the requirements of clause (ii) for the period commencing on the date on which the plan administrator provides a notice of distress termination to the corporation under subsection (a)(2) and ending on the date on which the plan administrator receives notification from the corporation of its determinations under subparagraph (A), and
<br>
<br>(II) meet the requirements of clause (ii) commencing on the date on which the plan administrator or the corporation makes a finding under subparagraph (C)(ii).
<br>(ii) Requirements
<br>
<br>The requirements of this clause are met by the plan administrator if the plan administrator—
<br>
<br>(I) refrains from distributing assets or taking any other actions to carry out the proposed termination under this subsection,
<br>
<br>(II) pays benefits attributable to employer contributions, other than death benefits, only in the form of an annuity,
<br>
<br>(III) does not use plan assets to purchase irrevocable commitments to provide benefits from an insurer, and
<br>
<br>(IV) continues to pay all benefit liabilities under the plan, but, commencing on the proposed termination date, limits the payment of benefits under the plan to those benefits which are guaranteed by the corporation under section 1322 of this title or to which assets are required to be allocated under section 1344 of this title.
<br>
<br> In the event the plan administrator is later determined not to have met the requirements for distress termination, any benefits which are not paid solely by reason of compliance with subclause (IV) shall be due and payable immediately (together with interest, at a reasonable rate, in accordance with regulations of the corporation).
<br>(d) Sufficiency
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section—
<br>(1) Sufficiency for benefit liabilities
<br>
<br>A single-employer plan is sufficient for benefit liabilities if there is no amount of unfunded benefit liabilities under the plan.
<br>(2) Sufficiency for guaranteed benefits
<br>
<br>A single-employer plan is sufficient for guaranteed benefits if there is no amount of unfunded guaranteed benefits under the plan.
<br>(e) Limitation on the conversion of a defined benefit plan to a defined contribution plan
<br>
<br>The adoption of an amendment to a plan which causes the plan to become a plan described in section 1321(b)(1) of this title constitutes a termination of the plan. Such an amendment may take effect only after the plan satisfies the requirements for standard termination under subsection (b) or distress termination under subsection (c).

<br>     "(II) Special notice regarding sufficiency for terminations for which notices of sufficiency have not been issued as of date of enactment.—In the case of a plan termination described in paragraph (1) with respect to which the Corporation has been provided the notification described in subparagraph (A)(i) and with respect to which a notice of sufficiency has not been issued by the Corporation before the date of the enactment of this Act, the Corporation shall make the determinations described in section 4041(c)(3)(A)(i) and (ii) (as amended by this title) and notify the plan administrator of such determinations as provided in section 4041(c)(3)(A)(iii) (as amended by this title).

<br>
<br>"(i) the plan could not otherwise, pursuant to the preceding provisions of this paragraph, terminate in a termination treated as a standard termination under section 4041(b) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (as amended by this title), and
<br>
<br>"(ii) the extension would result in a greater likelihood that benefit commitments under the plan would be paid in full,

<br>  except that any such period may not be so extended beyond one year after the date of the enactment of this Act.
<br>
<br>"(c) Authority To Prescribe Temporary Procedures.—The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation may prescribe temporary procedures for purposes of carrying out the amendments made by this title [see Short Title of 1986 Amendment note set out under section 1001 of this title] during the 180-day period beginning on the date described in subsection (a)."

<br>§1341a. Termination of multiemployer plans
<br>(a) Determinative factors
<br>
<br>Termination of a multiemployer plan under this section occurs as a result of—
<br>
<br>(1) the adoption after September 26, 1980, of a plan amendment which provides that participants will receive no credit for any purpose under the plan for service with any employer after the date specified by such amendment;
<br>
<br>(2) the withdrawal of every employer from the plan, within the meaning of section 1383 of this title, or the cessation of the obligation of all employers to contribute under the plan; or
<br>
<br>(3) the adoption of an amendment to the plan which causes the plan to become a plan described in section 1321(b)(1) of this title.
<br>(b) Date of termination
<br>
<br>(1) The date on which a plan terminates under paragraph (1) or (3) of subsection (a) is the later of—
<br>
<br>(A) the date on which the amendment is adopted, or
<br>
<br>(B) the date on which the amendment takes effect.
<br>
<br>(2) The date on which a plan terminates under paragraph (2) of subsection (a) is the earlier of—
<br>
<br>(A) the date on which the last employer withdraws, or
<br>
<br>(B) the first day of the first plan year for which no employer contributions were required under the plan.
<br>(c) Duties of plan sponsor of amended plan
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subsection (f)(1), the plan sponsor of a plan which terminates under paragraph (2) of subsection (a) shall—
<br>
<br>(1) limit the payment of benefits to benefits which are nonforfeitable under the plan as of the date of the termination, and
<br>
<br>(2) pay benefits attributable to employer contributions, other than death benefits, only in the form of an annuity, unless the plan assets are distributed in full satisfaction of all nonforfeitable benefits under the plan.
<br>(d) Duties of plan sponsor of nonoperative plan
<br>
<br>The plan sponsor of a plan which terminates under paragraph (2) of subsection (a) shall reduce benefits and suspend benefit payments in accordance with section 1441 of this title.
<br>(e) Amount of contribution of employer under amended plan for each plan year subsequent to plan termination date
<br>
<br>In the case of a plan which terminates under paragraph (1) or (3) of subsection (a), the rate of an employer's contributions under the plan for each plan year beginning on or after the plan termination date shall equal or exceed the highest rate of employer contributions at which the employer had an obligation to contribute under the plan in the 5 preceding plan years ending on or before the plan termination date, unless the corporation approves a reduction in the rate based on a finding that the plan is or soon will be fully funded.
<br>(f) Payment of benefits; reporting requirements for terminated plans and rules and standards for administration of such plans
<br>
<br>(1) The plan sponsor of a terminated plan may authorize the payment other than in the form of an annuity of a participant's entire nonforfeitable benefit attributable to employer contributions, other than a death benefit, if the value of the entire nonforfeitable benefit does not exceed $1,750. The corporation may authorize the payment of benefits under the terms of a terminated plan other than nonforfeitable benefits, or the payment other than in the form of an annuity of benefits having a value greater than $1,750, if the corporation determines that such payment is not adverse to the interest of the plan's participants and beneficiaries generally and does not unreasonably increase the corporation's risk of loss with respect to the plan.
<br>
<br>(2) The corporation may prescribe reporting requirements for terminated plans, and rules and standards for the administration of such plans, which the corporation considers appropriate to protect the interests of plan participants and beneficiaries or to prevent unreasonable loss to the corporation.

<br>§1342. Institution of termination proceedings by the corporation
<br>(a) Authority to institute proceedings to terminate a plan
<br>
<br>The corporation may institute proceedings under this section to terminate a plan whenever it determines that—
<br>
<br>(1) the plan has not met the minimum funding standard required under section 412 of title 26, or has been notified by the Secretary of the Treasury that a notice of deficiency under section 6212 of title 26 has been mailed with respect to the tax imposed under section 4971(a) of title 26,
<br>
<br>(2) the plan will be unable to pay benefits when due,
<br>
<br>(3) the reportable event described in section 1343(c)(7) of this title has occurred, or
<br>
<br>(4) the possible long-run loss of the corporation with respect to the plan may reasonably be expected to increase unreasonably if the plan is not terminated.
<br>
<br>The corporation shall as soon as practicable institute proceedings under this section to terminate a single-employer plan whenever the corporation determines that the plan does not have assets available to pay benefits which are currently due under the terms of the plan. The corporation may prescribe a simplified procedure to follow in terminating small plans as long as that procedure includes substantial safeguards for the rights of the participants and beneficiaries under the plans, and for the employers who maintain such plans (including the requirement for a court decree under subsection (c)). Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, the corporation is authorized to pool assets of terminated plans for purposes of administration, investment, payment of liabilities of all such terminated plans, and such other purposes as it determines to be appropriate in the administration of this subchapter.
<br>(b) Appointment of trustee
<br>
<br>(1) Whenever the corporation makes a determination under subsection (a) with respect to a plan or is required under subsection (a) to institute proceedings under this section, it may, upon notice to the plan, apply to the appropriate United States district court for the appointment of a trustee to administer the plan with respect to which the determination is made pending the issuance of a decree under subsection (c) ordering the termination of the plan. If within 3 business days after the filing of an application under this subsection, or such other period as the court may order, the administrator of the plan consents to the appointment of a trustee, or fails to show why a trustee should not be appointed, the court may grant the application and appoint a trustee to administer the plan in accordance with its terms until the corporation determines that the plan should be terminated or that termination is unnecessary. The corporation may request that it be appointed as trustee of a plan in any case.
<br>
<br>(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter—
<br>
<br>(A) upon the petition of a plan administrator or the corporation, the appropriate United States district court may appoint a trustee in accordance with the provisions of this section if the interests of the plan participants would be better served by the appointment of the trustee, and
<br>
<br>(B) upon the petition of the corporation, the appropriate United States district court shall appoint a trustee proposed by the corporation for a multiemployer plan which is in reorganization or to which section 1341a(d) of this title applies, unless such appointment would be adverse to the interests of the plan participants and beneficiaries in the aggregate.
<br>
<br>(3) The corporation and plan administrator may agree to the appointment of a trustee without proceeding in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2).
<br>(c) Adjudication that plan must be terminated
<br>
<br>(1) If the corporation is required under subsection (a) of this section to commence proceedings under this section with respect to a plan or, after issuing a notice under this section to a plan administrator, has determined that the plan should be terminated, it may, upon notice to the plan administrator, apply to the appropriate United States district court for a decree adjudicating that the plan must be terminated in order to protect the interests of the participants or to avoid any unreasonable deterioration of the financial condition of the plan or any unreasonable increase in the liability of the fund. If the trustee appointed under subsection (b) disagrees with the determination of the corporation under the preceding sentence he may intervene in the proceeding relating to the application for the decree, or make application for such decree himself. Upon granting a decree for which the corporation or trustee has applied under this subsection the court shall authorize the trustee appointed under subsection (b) (or appoint a trustee if one has not been appointed under such subsection and authorize him) to terminate the plan in accordance with the provisions of this subtitle. If the corporation and the plan administrator agree that a plan should be terminated and agree to the appointment of a trustee without proceeding in accordance with the requirements of this subsection (other than this sentence) the trustee shall have the power described in subsection (d)(1) and, in addition to any other duties imposed on the trustee under law or by agreement between the corporation and the plan administrator, the trustee is subject to the duties described in subsection (d)(3). Whenever a trustee appointed under this subchapter is operating a plan with discretion as to the date upon which final distribution of the assets is to be commenced, the trustee shall notify the corporation at least 10 days before the date on which he proposes to commence such distribution.
<br>
<br>(2) In the case of a proceeding initiated under this section, the plan administrator shall provide the corporation, upon the request of the corporation, the information described in clauses (ii), (iii), and (iv) of section 1341(c)(2)(A) of this title.
<br>
<br>(3) Disclosure of termination information.—
<br>
<br>(A) In general.—
<br>
<br>(i) Information from plan sponsor or administrator.—A plan sponsor or plan administrator of a single-employer plan that has received a notice from the corporation of a determination that the plan should be terminated under this section shall provide to an affected party any information provided to the corporation in connection with the plan termination.
<br>
<br>(ii) Information from corporation.—The corporation shall provide a copy of the administrative record, including the trusteeship decision record of a termination of a plan described under clause (i).
<br>
<br>(B) Timing of disclosure.—The plan sponsor, plan administrator, or the corporation, as applicable, shall provide the information described in subparagraph (A) not later than 15 days after—
<br>
<br>(i) receipt of a request from an affected party for such information; or
<br>
<br>(ii) in the case of information described under subparagraph (A)(i), the provision of any new information to the corporation relating to a previous request by an affected party.
<br>
<br>(C) Confidentiality.—
<br>
<br>(i) In general.—The plan administrator, the plan sponsor, or the corporation shall not provide information under subparagraph (A) in a form which includes any information that may directly or indirectly be associated with, or otherwise identify, an individual participant or beneficiary.
<br>
<br>(ii) Limitation.—A court may limit disclosure under this paragraph of confidential information described in section 552(b) of title 5 to authorized representatives (within the meaning of section 1341(c)(2)(D)(iv) of this title) of the participants or beneficiaries that agree to ensure the confidentiality of such information.
<br>
<br>(D) Form and manner of information; charges.—
<br>
<br>(i) Form and manner.—The corporation may prescribe the form and manner of the provision of information under this paragraph, which shall include delivery in written, electronic, or other appropriate form to the extent that such form is reasonably accessible to individuals to whom the information is required to be provided.
<br>
<br>(ii) Reasonable charges.—A plan sponsor may charge a reasonable fee for any information provided under this paragraph in other than electronic form.
<br>(d) Powers of trustee
<br>
<br>(1)(A) A trustee appointed under subsection (b) shall have the power—
<br>
<br>(i) to do any act authorized by the plan or this subchapter to be done by the plan administrator or any trustee of the plan;
<br>
<br>(ii) to require the transfer of all (or any part) of the assets and records of the plan to himself as trustee;
<br>
<br>(iii) to invest any assets of the plan which he holds in accordance with the provisions of the plan, regulations of the corporation, and applicable rules of law;
<br>
<br>(iv) to limit payment of benefits under the plan to basic benefits or to continue payment of some or all of the benefits which were being paid prior to his appointment;
<br>
<br>(v) in the case of a multiemployer plan, to reduce benefits or suspend benefit payments under the plan, give appropriate notices, amend the plan, and perform other acts required or authorized by subtitle (E) 1 to be performed by the plan sponsor or administrator;
<br>
<br>(vi) to do such other acts as he deems necessary to continue operation of the plan without increasing the potential liability of the corporation, if such acts may be done under the provisions of the plan; and
<br>
<br>(vii) to require the plan sponsor, the plan administrator, any contributing or withdrawn employer, and any employee organization representing plan participants to furnish any information with respect to the plan which the trustee may reasonably need in order to administer the plan.
<br>
<br>If the court to which application is made under subsection (c) dismisses the application with prejudice, or if the corporation fails to apply for a decree under subsection (c), within 30 days after the date on which the trustee is appointed under subsection (b), the trustee shall transfer all assets and records of the plan held by him to the plan administrator within 3 business days after such dismissal or the expiration of such 30-day period, and shall not be liable to the plan or any other person for his acts as trustee except for willful misconduct, or for conduct in violation of the provisions of part 4 of subtitle B of subchapter I of this chapter (except as provided in subsection (d)(1)(A)(v)).2 The 30-day period referred to in this subparagraph may be extended as provided by agreement between the plan administrator and the corporation or by court order obtained by the corporation.
<br>
<br>(B) If the court to which an application is made under subsection (c) issues the decree requested in such application, in addition to the powers described in subparagraph (A), the trustee shall have the power—
<br>
<br>(i) to pay benefits under the plan in accordance with the requirements of this subchapter;

<br>

<br>
<br>(v) to issue, publish, or file such notices, statements, and reports as may be required by the corporation or any order of the court;
<br>
<br>(vi) to liquidate the plan assets;
<br>
<br>(vii) to recover payments under section 1345(a) of this title; and
<br>
<br>(viii) to do such other acts as may be necessary to comply with this subchapter or any order of the court and to protect the interests of plan participants and beneficiaries.
