<br>§12556. Selection of participants
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>Participants in State Police Corps programs shall be selected on a competitive basis by each State under regulations prescribed by the Director.
<br>(b) Selection criteria and qualifications
<br>
<br>(1) In order to participate in a State Police Corps program, a participant shall—
<br>
<br>(A) be a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States;
<br>
<br>(B) meet the requirements for admission as a trainee of the State or local police force to which the participant will be assigned pursuant to section 12559(5) of this title, including achievement of satisfactory scores on any applicable examination, except that failure to meet the age requirement for a trainee of the State or local police shall not disqualify the applicant if the applicant will be of sufficient age upon completing an undergraduate course of study;
<br>
<br>(C) possess the necessary mental and physical capabilities and emotional characteristics to discharge effectively the duties of a law enforcement officer;
<br>
<br>(D) be of good character and demonstrate sincere motivation and dedication to law enforcement and public service;

<br>
<br>(H) except as provided in paragraph (2), be without previous law enforcement experience.

<br>
<br>(ii) have demonstrated special leadership potential and dedication to law enforcement.
<br>
<br>(B)(i) The prior period of law enforcement of a participant selected pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall not be counted toward satisfaction of the participant's 4-year service obligation under section 12558 of this title, and such a participant shall be subject to the same benefits and obligations under this part as other participants, including those stated in section 1 (b)(1)(E) and (F).
<br>

In a year in which applications are received in a number greater than that which will produce, in the judgment of the Director, a graduating class of more than 20,000, the Director shall, in deciding which applications to grant, give preference to those who will be participating in State plans that provide law enforcement personnel to areas of greatest need.
<br>(c) Recruitment of minorities

<br>Each State participating in the Police Corps program shall make special efforts to seek and recruit applicants from among members of all racial, ethnic or gender groups. This subsection does not authorize an exception from the competitive standards for admission established pursuant to subsections (a) and (b).

<br>
<br>(2) If the applicant is not matriculated or accepted as set forth in paragraph (1), the applicant's acceptance in the program shall be revoked.

<br>
<br>(2) A participant who requests a leave of absence from educational study, training or service for a period not to exceed 1 year (or 18 months in the aggregate in the event of multiple requests) for any reason other than those listed in paragraph (1) may be granted such leave of absence by the State.

Such programs may be carried out at up to 3 training centers established for this purpose and administered by the Director, or by contracting with existing State training facilities. The Director shall contract with a State training facility upon request of such facility if the Director determines that such facility offers a course of training substantially equivalent to the Police Corps training program described in this part.

<br>
<br>(3) The Director may enter into agreements with agencies of the Federal Government to utilize on a reimbursable basis space in Federal buildings and other resources.

Each State plan approved by the Director under section 12559 1 of this title shall include assurances that following completion of a participant's course of education each participant shall receive appropriate additional training by the State or local authority to which the participant is assigned. The time spent by a participant in such additional training, but not the time spent in Police Corps training, shall be counted toward fulfillment of the participant's 4-year service obligation.
<br>(d) Course of training
<br>
<br>The training sessions at training centers established under this section shall be designed to provide basic law enforcement training, including vigorous physical and mental training to teach participants self-discipline and organizational loyalty and to impart knowledge and understanding of legal processes and law enforcement.
<br>(e) Evaluation of participants
<br>
<br>A participant shall be evaluated during training for mental, physical, and emotional fitness, and shall be required to meet performance standards prescribed by the Director at the conclusion of each training session in order to remain in the Police Corps program.
<br>(f) Stipend
<br>
<br>The Director shall pay participants in training sessions a stipend of $400 a week during training.

<br>(a) Swearing in
<br>
<br>Upon satisfactory completion of the participant's course of education and training program established in section 12557 of this title and meeting the requirements of the police force to which the participant is assigned, a participant shall be sworn in as a member of the police force to which the participant is assigned pursuant to the State Police Corps plan, and shall serve for 4 years as a member of that police force.

<br>
<br>If the police force of which the participant is a member subjects the participant to discipline such as would preclude the participant's completing 4 years of service, and result in denial of educational assistance under section 12555 of this title, the Director may, upon a showing of good cause, permit the participant to complete the service obligation in an equivalent alternative law enforcement service and, if such service is satisfactorily completed, section 12555(d)(1)(B)(iii) of this title shall not apply.
<br>(d) Layoffs

<br>Section 12576 of this title, referred to in subsec. (b)(1), was in the original "section 200203", and was translated as reading "section 200207", meaning section 200207 of Pub. L. 103–322, to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because section 200203 of Pub. L. 103–322, which is classified to section 12572 of this title, does not provide for submission of applications, and section 12576 does so provide.
