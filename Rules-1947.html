<br>§14507. Supplements to federal grant programs
<br>
<br>(a) Definition.—
<br>
<br>(1) Federal grant programs.—In this section, the term "federal grant programs"—
<br>
<br>(A) means any federal grant program that provides assistance for the acquisition or development of land, the construction or equipment of facilities, or other community or economic development or economic adjustment activities, including a federal grant program authorized by—
<br>
<br>(i) the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 1921 et seq.);
<br>
<br>(ii) chapter 2003 of title 54;
<br>
<br>(iii) the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act (16 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.);
<br>
<br>(iv) the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 (20 U.S.C. 2301 et seq.);

<br>
<br>(b) Purpose.—To enable the people, States, and local communities of the Appalachian region, including local development districts, to take maximum advantage of federal grant programs for which they are eligible but for which, because of their economic situation, they cannot supply the required matching share, or for which there are insufficient amounts available under the federal law authorizing the programs to meet pressing needs of the region, the Federal Cochairman may use amounts made available to carry out this section—
<br>
<br>(1) for any part of the basic federal contribution to projects or activities under the federal grant programs authorized by federal laws; and
<br>
<br>(2) to increase the federal contribution to projects and activities under the programs above the fixed maximum part of the cost of the projects or activities otherwise authorized by the applicable law.
<br>
<br>(c) Certification Required.—For a program, project, or activity for which any part of the basic federal contribution to the project or activity under a federal grant program is proposed to be made under subsection (b), the contribution shall not be made until the responsible federal official administering the federal law authorizing the contribution certifies that the program, project, or activity meets the applicable requirements of the federal law and could be approved for federal contribution under that law if amounts were available under the law for the program, project, or activity.
<br>
<br>(d) Limitations in Other Laws Inapplicable.—Amounts provided pursuant to this subtitle are available without regard to any limitations on areas eligible for assistance or authorizations for appropriation in any other law.
<br>
<br>(e) Acceptance of Certain Material.—For a supplemental grant for a project or activity under a federal grant program, the Federal Cochairman shall accept any finding, report, certification, or documentation required to be submitted to the head of the department, agency, or instrumentality of the Federal Government responsible for the administration of the program.
<br>

<br>(1) be increased to more than the percentages the Commission establishes; nor
<br>
<br>(2) be more than 80 percent of the cost.
<br>
<br>(g) Maximum Commission Contribution.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), the Commission may contribute not more than 50 percent of a project or activity cost eligible for financial assistance under this section from amounts appropriated to carry out this subtitle.
<br>
<br>(2) Distressed counties.—The maximum Commission contribution for a project or activity to be carried out in a county for which a distressed county designation is in effect under section 14526 of this title may be increased to 80 percent.
<br>
<br>(3) At-risk counties.—The maximum Commission contribution for a project to be carried out in a county for which an at-risk county designation is in effect under section 14526 may be increased to 70 percent.

<br>SUBCHAPTER II—ADMINISTRATIVE
<br>§14521. Required level of expenditure
<br>
<br>A State or political subdivision of a State is not eligible to receive benefits under this subtitle unless the aggregate expenditure of state amounts, except expenditures for participation in the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways and local and federal amounts, for the benefit of the area within the State located in the Appalachian region is maintained at a level which does not fall below the average level of those expenditures for the State's last two full fiscal years prior to March 9, 1965. In computing the level, a State's past expenditure for participation in the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways and expenditures of local and federal amounts shall not be included. The Commission shall recommend to the President a lesser requirement when it finds that a substantial population decrease in that part of a State which lies within the region would not justify a state expenditure equal to the average level of the last two years or when it finds that a State's average level of expenditure in an individual program has been disproportionate to the present need for that part of the State.

<br>
<br>(a) Factors To Be Considered.—In considering programs and projects to be given assistance under this subtitle, and in establishing a priority ranking of the requests for assistance presented to the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Commission shall follow procedures that will ensure consideration of—
<br>
<br>(1) the relationship of the project or class of projects to overall regional development, including its location in a severely and persistently distressed county or area;
<br>
<br>(2) the population and area to be served by the project or class of projects, including the per capita market income and the unemployment rates in the area;
<br>
<br>(3) the relative financial resources available to the State or political subdivisions or instrumentalities of the State that seek to undertake the project;
<br>
<br>(4) the importance of the project or class of projects in relation to other projects or classes of projects that may be in competition for the same amounts;
<br>
<br>(5) the prospects that the project for which assistance is sought will improve, on a continuing rather than a temporary basis, the opportunities for employment, the average level of income, or the economic and social development of the area served by the project; and
<br>
<br>(6) the extent to which the project design provides for detailed outcome measurements by which grant expenditures may be evaluated.
<br>
<br>(b) Limitation on Use.—Financial assistance made available under this subtitle shall not be used to assist establishments relocating from one area to another.
<br>
<br>(c) Determination Required Before Amounts May Be Provided.—Amounts may be provided for programs and projects in a State under this subtitle only if the Commission determines that the level of federal and state financial assistance under other laws for the same type of programs or projects in that part of the State within the Appalachian region will not be diminished in order to substitute amounts authorized by this subtitle.
<br>
<br>(d) Minimum Amount of Assistance to Distressed Counties and Areas.—For each fiscal year, not less than 50 percent of the amount of grant expenditures the Commission approves shall support activities or projects that benefit severely and persistently distressed counties and areas.

<br>
<br>(b) Areawide Action Programs.—The Commission shall encourage the preparation and execution of areawide action programs that specify interrelated projects and schedules of actions, the necessary agency funding, and other commitments to implement the programs. The programs shall make appropriate use of existing plans affecting the area.
<br>
<br>(c) Local Development Districts.—Local development districts certified by the State as described in section 14102(a)(2) of this title provide the linkage between state and substate planning and development. The districts shall assist the States in the coordination of areawide programs and projects and may prepare and adopt areawide plans or action programs. In carrying out the development planning process, including the selection of programs and projects for assistance, States shall consult with local development districts, local units of government, and citizen groups and shall consider the goals, objectives, priorities, and recommendations of those bodies.

<br>(d) Federal Responsibilities.—To the maximum extent practicable, federal departments, agencies, and instrumentalities undertaking or providing financial assistance for programs or projects in the region shall—
<br>
<br>(1) take into account the policies, goals, and objectives the Commission and its member States establish pursuant to this subtitle;
