<br>
<br>10Cast out the scorner, and contention will go out;
<br>Yea, strife and shame will cease.
<br>
<br>11He that loveth pureness of heart,
<br>That hath grace in his lips, the king shall be his friend.
<br>
<br>12The eyes of the LORD preserve him that hath knowledge,
<br>But He overthroweth the words of the faithless man.
<br>
<br>13The sluggard saith: ‘There is a lion without;
<br>I shall be slain in the streets.’
<br> 
<br>
<br>14The mouth of strange women is a deep pit:
<br>He that is abhorred of the LORD shall fall therein.
<br>
<br>15Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child;
<br>But the rod of correction shall drive it far from him.
<br>
<br>16One may oppress the poor, yet will their gain increase;
<br>One may give to the rich, yet will want come.
<br>
<br>17Incline thine ear, and hear the words of the wise,
<br>And apply thy heart unto my knowledge.
<br>18For it is a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee;
<br>Let them be established altogether upon thy lips.
<br>19That thy trust may be in the LORD,
<br>I have made them known to thee this day, even to thee.
<br>20Have not I written unto thee excellent things
<br>Of counsels and knowledge;
<br>21That I might make thee know the certainty of the words of truth,
<br>That thou mightest bring back words of truth to them that send thee?
<br>
<br>22Rob not the weak, because he is weak,
<br>Neither crush the poor in the gate;
<br> 
<br>23For the LORD will plead their cause,
<br>And despoil of life those that despoil them.
<br>
<br>24Make no friendship with a man that is given to anger;
<br>And with a wrathful man thou shalt not go;
<br>25Lest thou learn his ways, And get a snare to thy soul.
<br>
<br>26Be thou not of them that strike hands,
<br>Or of them that are sureties for debts;
<br>27If thou hast not wherewith to pay,
<br>Why should he take away thy bed from under thee?
<br>
<br>28Remove not the ancient landmark, Which thy fathers have set.
<br>
<br>29Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings;
<br>He shall not stand before mean men.
<br>
<br>When thou sittest to eat with a ruler,
<br>Consider well him that is before thee;
<br>2And put a knife to thy throat,
<br>If thou be a man given to appetite. 3Be not desirous of his dainties; Seeing they are deceitful food.
<br>4Weary not thyself to be rich; Cease from thine own wisdom.
<br> 
<br>5Wilt thou set thine eyes upon it? it is gone;
<br>For riches certainly make themselves wings,
<br>Like an eagle that flieth toward heaven.
<br>
<br>6Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye,
<br>Neither desire thou his dainties;
<br>7For as one that hath reckoned within himself, so is he:
<br>‘Eat and drink’, saith he to thee; But his heart is not with thee.
<br>8The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up,
<br>And lose thy sweet words.
<br>
<br>9Speak not in the ears of a fool;
<br>For he will despise the wisdom of thy words.
<br>
<br>10Remove not the ancient landmark;
<br>And enter not into the fields of the fatherless;
<br>11For their Redeemer is strong;
<br>He will plead their cause with thee.
<br>
<br>12Apply thy heart unto instruction,
<br>And thine ears to the words of knowledge.
<br>
<br>13Withhold not correction from the child;
<br>For though thou beat him with the rod, he will not die.
<br>14Thou beatest him with the rod,
<br>And wilt deliver his soul from the nether-world.
<br> 
<br>
<br>15My son, if thy heart be wise, My heart will be glad, even mine; 16Yea, my reins will rejoice, When thy lips speak right things.
<br>
<br>17Let not thy heart envy sinners,
<br>But be in the fear of the LORD all the day;
<br>18For surely there is a future; And thy hope shall not be cut off.
<br>
<br>19Hear thou, my son, and be wise, And guide thy heart in the way. 20Be not among winebibbers; Among gluttonous eaters of flesh; 21For the drunkard and the glutton
<br>shall come to poverty;
<br>And drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags.
<br>
<br>22Hearken unto thy father that begot thee,
<br>And despise not thy mother when she is old.
<br>
<br>23Buy the truth, and sell it not;
<br>Also wisdom, and instruction, and understanding.
<br>24The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice;
<br>And he that begetteth a wise child will have joy of him.
<br>25Let thy father and thy mother be glad,
<br>And let her that bore thee rejoice.
<br>
<br>26My son, give me thy heart,
<br>And let thine eyes observe my ways.
<br> 
<br>27For a harlot is a deep ditch;
<br>And an alien woman is a narrow pit.
<br>28She also lieth in wait as a robber,
<br>And increaseth the faithless among men.
<br>
<br>29Who crieth: ‘Woe’? who: ‘Alas’?
<br>Who hath contentions? who hath raving?
<br>Who hath wounds without cause? Who hath redness of eyes?
<br>30They that tarry long at the wine; They that go to try mixed wine. 31Look not thou upon the wine when
<br>it is red,
<br>When it giveth its colour in the cup, When it glideth down smoothly; 32At the last it biteth like a serpent, And stingeth like a basilisk.
<br>33Thine eyes shall behold strange things,
<br>And thy heart shall utter confused things.
<br>34Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea,
<br>Or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.
<br>35’They have struck me, and I felt it not,
<br>They have beaten me, and I knew it not;
<br>When shall I awake? I will seek it yet again.’
<br>
<br>Be not thou envious of evil men,
<br>Neither desire to be with them.
<br>2For their heart studieth destruction, And their lips talk of mischief.
<br> 
<br>
<br>3Through wisdom is a house builded;
<br>And by understanding it is established;
<br>4And by knowledge are the chambers filled
<br>With all precious and pleasant riches.
<br>
<br>5A wise man is strong;
<br>Yea, a man of knowledge increaseth strength.
<br>6For with wise advice thou shalt make thy war;
<br>And in the multitude of counsellors there is safety.
<br>
<br>7Wisdom is as unattainable to a fool as corals;
<br>He openeth not his mouth in the gate.
<br>
<br>8He that deviseth to do evil,
<br>Men shall call him a mischievous person.
<br>9The thought of foolishness is sin;
<br>And the scorner is an abomination to men.
<br>10If thou faint in the day of adversity,
<br>Thy strength is small indeed.
<br>11Deliver them that are drawn unto death;
<br>And those that are ready to be slain wilt thou forbear to rescue?
<br>12If thou sayest: ‘Behold, we knew not this’,
<br> 
<br>Doth not He that weigheth the hearts consider it?
<br>And He that keepeth thy soul, doth not He know it?
<br>And shall not He render to every man according to his works?
<br>
<br>13My son, eat thou honey, for it is good,
<br>And the honeycomb is sweet to thy taste;
<br>14So know thou wisdom to be unto thy soul;
<br>If thou hast found it, then shall there be a future,
<br>And thy hope shall not be cut off.
<br>
<br>15Lie not in wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous,
<br>Spoil not his resting-place;
<br>16For a righteous man falleth seven times, and riseth up again,
<br>But the wicked stumble under adversity.
<br>
<br>17Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth,
<br>And let not thy heart be glad when he stumbleth;
<br>18Lest the LORD see it, and it displease Him,
<br>And He turn away His wrath from him.
<br>19Fret not thyself because of evildoers,
<br>Neither be thou envious at the wicked;
<br> 
<br>20For there will be no future to the evil man,
<br>The lamp of the wicked shall be put out.
<br>
<br>21My son, fear thou the LORD and the king,
<br>And meddle not with them that are given to change;
<br>22For their calamity shall rise suddenly;
<br>And who knoweth the ruin from them both?
<br>
<br>23These also are sayings of the wise.
<br>
<br>To have respect of persons in judgment is not good.
<br>24He that saith unto the wicked: ‘Thou art righteous’,
<br>Peoples shall curse him, nations shall execrate him;
<br>25But to them that decide justly shall be delight,
<br>And a good blessing shall come upon them.
<br>26He kisseth the lips
<br>That giveth a right answer.
<br>
<br>27Prepare thy work without,
<br>And make it fit for thyself in the field;
<br>And afterwards build thy house.
<br>
<br>28Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause; And deceive not with thy lips.
<br>29Say not: ‘I will do so to him as he hath done to me;
<br> 
<br>I will render to the man according to his work.’
<br>
<br>
<br>30I went by the field of the slothful,
<br>And by the vineyard of the man void of understanding;
<br>31And, lo, it was all grown over with thistles,
<br>The face thereof was covered with nettles,
<br>And the stone wall thereof was broken down.
<br>32Then I beheld, and considered well;
<br>I saw, and received instruction.
<br>33’Yet a little sleep, a little slumber,
<br>A little folding of the hands to sleep’—
<br>34So shall thy poverty come as a runner,
<br>And thy want as an armed man.
<br>
<br>These also are proverbs of Solomon, which the men of
<br>Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.
<br>
<br>2It is the glory of God to conceal a thing; but the glory of kings is to search out a matter.
<br>3The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings is unsearchable.
<br>
<br>4Take away the dross from the silver, and there cometh forth a vessel for the refiner;
<br> 
<br>5Take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness.
<br>
<br>6Glorify not thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great men;
<br>7For better is it that it be said unto thee: ‘Come up hither’, than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince, whom thine eyes have seen.
<br>
<br>8Go not forth hastily to strive, lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame.
<br>9Debate thy cause with thy neighbour, but reveal not the secret of another;
<br>10Lest he that heareth it revile thee, and thine infamy turn not away.
<br>
<br>11A word fitly spoken
<br>Is like apples of gold in settings of silver.
<br>
<br>12As an ear-ring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold,
<br>So is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear.
<br>
<br>13As the cold of snow in the time of harvest,
<br>So is a faithful messenger to him that sendeth him;
<br>For he refresheth the soul of his master.
<br> 
<br>14As vapours and wind without rain,
<br>So is he that boasteth himself of a false gift.
<br>
<br>15By long forbearing is a ruler persuaded,
<br>And a soft tongue breaketh the bone.
<br>
<br>16Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee,
<br>Lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.
<br>
<br>17Let thy foot be seldom in thy neighbour’s house;
<br>Lest he be sated with thee, and hate thee.
<br>
<br>18As a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow,
<br>So is a man that beareth false witness against his neighbour.
<br>
<br>19Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble
<br>Is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.
<br>
<br>20As one that taketh off a garment in cold weather, and as vinegar upon nitre,
<br>So is he that singeth songs to a heavy heart.
<br>
<br>21If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat,
<br>And if he be thirsty, give him water to drink;
<br> 
<br>22For thou wilt heap coals of fire upon his head,
<br>And the LORD will reward thee.
<br>
<br>23The north wind bringeth forth rain,
<br>And a backbiting tongue an angry countenance.
<br>
<br>24It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop,
<br>Than in a house in common with a contentious woman.
<br>
<br>25As cold waters to a faint soul,
<br>So is good news from a far country.
<br>
<br>26As a troubled fountain, and a corrupted spring,
<br>So is a righteous man that giveth way before the wicked.
<br>
<br>27It is not good to eat much honey;
<br>So for men to search out their own glory is not glory.
<br>
<br>28Like a city broken down and without a wall,
<br>So is he whose spirit is without restraint.
<br>
<br>As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest,
<br>So honour is not seemly for a fool.
<br>
<br>2As the wandering sparrow, as the flying swallow,
<br>So the curse that is causeless shall come home.
<br> 
<br>3A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass,
<br>And a rod for the back of fools.
<br>
<br>4Answer not a fool according to his folly,
<br>Lest thou also be like unto him.
<br>
<br>5Answer a fool according to his folly,
<br>Lest he be wise in his own eyes.
<br>
<br>6He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool
<br>Cutteth off his own feet, and drinketh damage.
<br>
<br>7The legs hang limp from the lame;
<br>So is a parable in the mouth of fools.
<br>
<br>8As a small stone in a heap of stones,
<br>So is he that giveth honour to a fool.
<br>
<br>9As a thorn that cometh into the hand of a drunkard,
<br>So is a parable in the mouth of fools.
<br>
<br>10A master performeth all things;
<br>But he that stoppeth a fool is as one that stoppeth a flood.
<br>
<br>11As a dog that returneth to his vomit,
<br>So is a fool that repeateth his folly.
<br> 
<br>12Seest thou a man wise in his own eyes?
<br>There is more hope of a fool than of him.
<br>
<br>13The sluggard saith: ‘There is a lion in the way;
<br>Yea, a lion is in the streets.’
<br>
<br>14The door is turning upon its hinges,
<br>And the sluggard is still upon his bed.
<br>
<br>15The sluggard burieth his hand in the dish;
<br>It wearieth him to bring it back to his mouth.
<br>
<br>16The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes
<br>Than seven men that give wise answer.
<br>
<br>17He that passeth by, and meddleth with strife not his own,
<br>Is like one that taketh a dog by the ears.
<br>
<br>18As a madman who casteth firebrands,
<br>Arrows, and death;
<br>19So is the man that deceiveth his neighbour,
<br>And saith: ‘Am not I in sport?’
<br>
<br>20Where no wood is, the fire goeth out;
<br> 
<br>And where there is no whisperer, contention ceaseth.
<br>
<br>21As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire;
<br>So is a contentious man to kindle strife.
<br>
<br>22The words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels,
<br>And they go down into the innermost parts of the body.
<br>
<br>23Burning lips and a wicked heart Are like an earthen vessel overlaid
<br>with silver dross.
<br>
<br>24He that hateth dissembleth with his lips,
<br>But he layeth up deceit within him.
<br>25When he speaketh fair, Believe him not;
<br>For there are seven abominations in his heart.
<br>26Though his hatred be concealed with deceit,
<br>His wickedness shall be revealed before the congregation.
<br>
<br>27Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein;
<br>And he that rolleth a stone, it shall return upon him.
<br>
<br>28A lying tongue hateth those that are crushed by it;
<br>And a flattering mouth worketh ruin.
<br> 
<br>Boast not thyself of to- morrow;
<br>For thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.
<br>
<br>2Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth;
<br>A stranger, and not thine own lips.
<br>
<br>3A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty;
<br>But a fool’s vexation is heavier than they both.
<br>
<br>4Wrath is cruel, and anger is overwhelming;
<br>But who is able to stand before jealousy?
<br>
<br>5Better is open rebuke Than love that is hidden.
<br>
<br>6Faithful are the wounds of a friend;
<br>But the kisses of an enemy are importunate.
<br>
<br>7The full soul loatheth a honeycomb;
<br>But to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.
<br>
<br>8As a bird that wandereth from her nest,
<br>So is a man that wandereth from his place.
<br>
<br>9Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart;
<br> 
<br>So doth the sweetness of a man’s friend by hearty counsel.
<br>
<br>10Thine own friend, and thy father’s friend, forsake not;
<br>Neither go into thy brother’s house in the day of thy calamity;
<br>Better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off.
<br>
<br>11My son, be wise, and make my heart glad,
<br>That I may answer him that taunteth me.
<br>
<br>12A prudent man seeth the evil, and hideth himself;
<br>But the thoughtless pass on, and are punished.
<br>
<br>13Take his garment that is surety for a stranger;
<br>And hold him in pledge that is surety for an alien woman.
<br>
<br>14He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning,
<br>It shall be counted a curse to him.
<br>
<br>15A continual dropping in a very rainy day
<br>And a contentious woman are alike;
<br>16He that would hide her hideth the wind,
<br>And the ointment of his right hand betrayeth itself.
<br>
<br>17Iron sharpeneth iron;
<br> 
<br>So a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.
<br>
<br>18Whoso keepeth the fig-tree shall eat the fruit thereof;
<br>And he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured.
<br>
<br>19As in water face answereth to face, So the heart of man to man.
<br>
<br>20The nether-world and Destruction are never satiated;
<br>So the eyes of man are never satiated.
<br>
<br>21The refining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold,
<br>And a man is tried by his praise.
<br>
<br>22Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar with a pestle among groats,
<br>Yet will not his foolishness depart from him.
<br>
<br>23Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks,
<br>And look well to thy herds;
<br>24For riches are not for ever;
<br>And doth the crown endure unto all generations?
<br>25When the hay is mown, and the tender grass showeth itself,
<br>And the herbs of the mountains are gathered in;
<br>26The lambs will be for thy clothing, And the goats the price for a field.
<br> 
<br>27And there will be goats’milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household;
<br>And maintenance for thy maidens.
<br>
<br>The wicked flee when no man pursueth;
<br>But the righteous are secure as a young lion.
<br>
<br>2For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof;
<br>But by a man of understanding and knowledge established order shall long continue.
<br>
<br>3A poor man that oppresseth the weak
<br>Is like a sweeping rain which leaveth no food.
<br>
<br>4They that forsake the law praise the wicked;
<br>But such as keep the law contend with them.
<br>
<br>5Evil men understand not justice;
<br>But they that seek the LORD understand all things.
<br>
<br>6Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity,
<br>Than he that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich.
<br>
<br>7A wise son observeth the teaching; ut he that is a companion of gluttonous men shameth his father.
<br> 
<br>
<br>8He that augmenteth his substance by interest and increase,
<br>Gathereth it for him that is gracious to the poor.
<br>
<br>9He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law,
<br>Even his prayer is an abomination.
<br>
<br>10Whoso causeth the upright to go astray in an evil way,
<br>He shall fall himself into his own pit;
<br>But the whole-hearted shall inherit good.
<br>
<br>11The rich man is wise in his own eyes;
<br>But the poor that hath understanding searcheth him through.
<br>
<br>12When the righteous exult, there is great glory;
<br>But when the wicked rise, men must be sought for.
<br>
<br>13He that covereth his transgressions shall not prosper;
<br>But whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall obtain mercy.
<br>
<br>14Happy is the man that feareth alway;
<br>But he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into evil.
<br>
<br>15As a roaring lion, and a ravenous bear;
<br> 
<br>So is a wicked ruler over a poor people.
<br>
<br>16The prince that lacketh understanding is also a great oppressor;
<br>But he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days.
<br>
<br>17A man that is laden with the blood of any person
<br>Shall hasten his steps unto the pit; none will support him.
<br>
<br>18Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved;
<br>But he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once.
<br>
<br>19He that tilleth his ground shall have plenty of bread;
<br>But he that followeth after vain things shall have poverty enough.
<br>
<br>20A faithful man shall abound with blessings;
<br>But he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be unpunished.
<br>
<br>21To have respect of persons is not good;
<br>For a man will transgress for a piece of bread.
<br>
<br>22He that hath an evil eye hasteneth after riches,
<br>And knoweth not that want shall come upon him.
<br> 
<br>23He that rebuketh a man shall in the end find more favour
<br>Than he that flattereth with the tongue.
<br>
<br>24Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith: ‘It is no transgression’,
<br>The same is the companion of a destroyer.
<br>
<br>25He that is of a greedy spirit stirreth up strife;
<br>But he that putteth his trust in the LORD shall be abundantly gratified.
<br>
<br>26He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool;
<br>But whoso walketh wisely, he shall escape.
<br>
<br>27He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack;
<br>But he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse.
<br>
<br>28When the wicked rise, men hide themselves;
<br>But when they perish, the righteous increase.
<br>
<br>He that being often reproved hardeneth his neck
<br>Shall suddenly be broken, and that without remedy.
<br>
<br>2When the righteous are increased, the people rejoice;
<br> 
<br>But when the wicked beareth rule, the people sigh.
<br>
<br>3Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father;
<br>But he that keepeth company with harlots wasteth his substance.
<br>
<br>4The king by justice establisheth the land;
<br>But he that exacteth gifts overthroweth it.
<br>
<br>5A man that flattereth his neighbour Spreadeth a net for his steps.
<br>
<br>6In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare;
<br>But the righteous doth sing and rejoice.
<br>
<br>7The righteous taketh knowledge of the cause of the poor;
<br>The wicked understandeth not knowledge.
<br>
<br>8Scornful men set a city in a blaze; But wise men turn away wrath.
<br>
<br>9If a wise man contendeth with a foolish man,
<br>Whether he be angry or laugh, there will be no rest.
<br>
<br>10The men of blood hate him that is sincere;
<br>And as for the upright, they seek his life.
<br> 
<br>11A fool spendeth all his spirit;
<br>But a wise man stilleth it within him.
<br>
<br>12If a ruler hearkeneth to falsehood, All his servants are wicked.
<br>
<br>13The poor man and the oppressor meet together;
<br>The LORD giveth light to the eyes of them both.
<br>
<br>14The king that faithfully judgeth the poor,
<br>His throne shall be established for ever.
<br>
<br>15The rod and reproof give wisdom;
<br>But a child left to himself causeth shame to his mother.
<br>
<br>16When the wicked are increased, transgression increaseth;
<br>But the righteous shall gaze upon their fall.
<br>
<br>17Correct thy son, and he will give thee rest;
<br>Yea, he will give delight unto thy soul.
<br>
<br>18Where there is no vision, the people cast off restraint;
<br>But he that keepeth the law, happy is he.
<br>
<br>19A servant will not be corrected by words;
<br> 
<br>For though he understand, there will be no response.
<br>
<br>20Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words?
<br>There is more hope for a fool than for him.
<br>
<br>21He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child
<br>Shall have him become master at the last.
<br>
<br>22An angry man stirreth up strife,
<br>And a wrathful man aboundeth in transgression.
<br>
<br>23A man’s pride shall bring him low;
<br>But he that is of a lowly spirit shall attain to honour.
<br>
<br>24Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul:
<br>He heareth the adjuration and uttereth nothing.
<br>
<br>25The fear of man bringeth a snare; But whoso putteth his trust in the
<br>LORD shall be set up on high.
<br>
<br>26Many seek the ruler’s favour;
<br>But a man’s judgment cometh from the LORD.
<br>
<br>27An unjust man is an abomination to the righteous;
<br>And he that is upright in the way is an abomination to the wicked.
<br> 
<br>The words of Agur the son of Jakeh; the burden.
<br>
<br>The man saith unto Ithiel, unto Ithiel and Ucal:
<br>2Surely I am brutish, unlike a man,
<br>And have not the understanding of a man;
<br>3And I have not learned wisdom,
<br>That I should have the knowledge of the Holy One.
<br>4Who hath ascended up into heaven, and descended?
<br>Who hath gathered the wind in his fists?
<br>Who hath bound the waters in his garment?
<br>Who hath established all the ends of the earth?
<br>What is his name, and what is his son’s name, if thou knowest?
<br>
<br>5Every word of God is tried;
<br>He is a shield unto them that take refuge in Him.
<br>6Add thou not unto His words,
<br>Lest He reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.
<br>
<br>7Two things have I asked of Thee; Deny me them not before I die: 8Remove far from me falsehood and
<br>lies;
<br>Give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with mine allotted bread;
<br>9Lest I be full, and deny, and say: ‘Who is the LORD?’
<br>Or lest I be poor, and steal,
<br>And profane the name of my God.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>10Slander not a servant unto his master,
<br>Lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty.
<br>
<br>11There is a generation that curse their father,
<br>And do not bless their mother.
<br>12There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes,
<br>And yet are not washed from their filthiness.
<br>13There is a generation, Oh how lofty are their eyes!
<br>And their eyelids are lifted up.
<br>14There is a generation whose teeth are as swords, and their great teeth as knives,
<br>To devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among men.
<br>
<br>15The horseleech hath two daughters: ‘Give, give.’
<br>There are three things that are never satisfied,
<br>Yea, four that say not: ‘Enough’:
<br>16The grave; and the barren womb;
<br>The earth that is not satisfied with water;
<br>And the fire that saith not: ‘Enough.’
<br>
<br>17The eye that mocketh at his father, And despiseth to obey his mother,
<br>The ravens of the valley shall pick it out,
<br>And the young vultures shall eat it.
<br> 
<br>18There are three things which are too wonderful for me,
<br>Yea, four which I know not: 19The way of an eagle in the air; The way of a serpent upon a rock;
<br>The way of a ship in the midst of the sea;
<br>And the way of a man with a young woman.
<br>20So is the way of an adulterous woman;
<br>She eateth, and wipeth her mouth,
<br>And saith: ‘I have done no wickedness.’
<br>
<br>21For three things the earth doth quake,
<br>And for four it cannot endure:
<br>22For a servant when he reigneth;
<br>And a churl when he is filled with food;
<br>23For an odious woman when she is married;
<br>And a handmaid that is heir to her mistress.
<br>
<br>24There are four things which are little upon the earth,
<br>But they are exceeding wise:
<br>25The ants are a people not strong,
<br>Yet they provide their food in the summer;
<br>26The rock-badgers are but a feeble folk,
<br>Yet make they their houses in the crags;
<br>27The locusts have no king,
<br> 
<br>Yet go they forth all of them by bands;
<br>28The spider thou canst take with the hands,
<br>Yet is she in kings’palaces.
<br>
<br>29There are three things which are stately in their march,
<br>Yea, four which are stately in going:
<br>30The lion, which is mightiest among beasts,
<br>And turneth not away for any;
<br>31The greyhound; the he-goat also;
<br>And the king, against whom there is no rising up.
<br>
<br>32If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself,
<br>Or if thou hast planned devices, lay thy hand upon thy mouth.
<br>33For the churning of milk bringeth forth curd,
<br>And the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood;
<br>So the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.
<br>
<br>The words of king Lemuel; the burden wherewith his mother
<br>corrected him.
<br>
<br>2What, my son? and what, O son of my womb?
<br>And what, O son of my vows?
<br>3Give not thy strength unto women,
<br>Nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.
<br> 
<br>4It is not for kings, O aLemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine:
<br>Nor for princes to say: ‘Where is strong drink?’
<br>5Lest they drink, and forget that which is decreed,
<br>And pervert the justice due to any that is afflicted.
<br>6Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish,
<br>And wine unto the bitter in soul;
<br>7Let him drink, and forget his poverty,
<br>And remember his misery no more.
<br>8Open thy mouth for the dumb,
<br>In the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction.
<br>9Open thy mouth, judge righteously,
<br>And plead the cause of the poor and needy.

<br>JOB
<br> 
<br>THERE was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and
<br>that man was whole-hearted and upright, and one that feared God, and shunned evil. 2And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters. 3His possessions also were seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she- asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east. 4And his sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each one upon his day; and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and to drink with them. 5And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt- offerings according to the number of them all; for Job said: ‘It may be that my sons have sinned, and blasphemed God in their hearts.’ Thus did Job continually.
<br>6Now it fell upon a day, that the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and aSatan came also among them. 7And the LORD said unto Satan: ‘Whence comest thou?’ Then Satan answered the LORD,
<br>
<br>
<br>a That is, the Adversary.
<br> 
<br>and said: ‘From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.’ 8And the LORD said unto Satan: ‘Hast thou considered My servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a whole-hearted and an upright man, one that feareth God, and shunneth evil?’ 9Then Satan answered the LORD, and said: ‘Doth Job fear God for nought? 10Hast not Thou made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath, on every side? Thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions are increased in the land. 11But put forth Thy hand now, and touch all that he hath, surely he will blaspheme Thee to Thy face.’ 12And the LORD said unto Satan: ‘Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thy hand.’ So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.
<br>13And it fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house, 14that there came a messenger unto Job, and said: ‘The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them; 15and the Sabeans made a raid, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.’ 16While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said: ‘A
<br> 
<br>fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.’ 17While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said: ‘The Chaldeans set themselves in three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have taken them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.’ 18While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said: ‘Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house; 19And, behold, there came a great wind from across the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young people, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.’
<br>20Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped; 21And he said;
<br>Naked came I out of my mother’s womb,
<br>And naked shall I return thither;
<br>The LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away;
<br>Blessed be the name of the LORD. 22For all this Job sinned not, nor ascribed aught unseemly to God.
<br>Again it fell upon a day, that the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD. 2And the LORD said unto Satan: ‘From whence
<br> 
<br>comest thou?’ And Satan answered the LORD, and said: ‘From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.’ 3And the LORD said unto Satan: ‘Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a whole-hearted and an upright man, one that feareth God, and shunneth evil? and he still holdeth fast his integrity, although thou didst move Me against him, to destroy him without cause.’ 4And Satan answered the LORD, and said: ‘Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life. 5But put forth Thy hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, surely he will blaspheme Thee to Thy face.’ 6And the LORD said unto Satan: ‘Behold, he is in thy hand; only spare his life.’
<br>7So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot even unto his crown. 8And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself therewith; and he sat among the ashes. 9Then said his wife unto him: ‘Dost thou still hold fast thine integrity? blaspheme God, and die.’ 10But he said unto her: ‘Thou speakest as one of the impious women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?’ For all this did not Job sin with his lips.
<br>11Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place, Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the
<br> 
<br>Naamathite; and they made an appointment together to come to bemoan him and to comfort him. 12And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and threw dust upon their heads toward heaven. 13So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spoke a word unto him; for they saw that his grief was very great.
<br>
<br>After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day. 2And Job
<br>spoke, and said:
<br>3Let the day perish wherein I was born,
<br>And the night wherein it was said: ‘A man-child is brought forth.’
<br>4Let that day be darkness;
<br>Let not God inquire after it from above,
<br>Neither let the light shine upon it. 5Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own;
<br>Let a cloud dwell upon it;
<br>Let all that maketh black the day terrify it.
<br>6As for that night, let thick darkness seize upon it;
<br>Let it not rejoice among the days of the year;
<br>Let it not come into the number of the months.
<br>7Lo, let that night be desolate; Let no joyful voice come therein.
<br>8Let them curse it that curse the day,
<br> 
<br>Who are ready to rouse up leviathan.
<br>9Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark;
<br>Let it look for light, but have none;
<br>Neither let it behold the eyelids of the morning;
<br>10Because it shut not up the doors of my [mother’s] womb,
<br>Nor hid trouble from mine eyes.
<br>
<br>11Why died I not from the womb? Why did I not perish at birth?
<br>12Why did the knees receive me?
<br>And wherefore the breasts, that I should suck?
<br>13For now should I have lain still and been quiet;
<br>I should have slept; then had I been at rest—
<br>14With kings and counsellors of the earth,
<br>Who built up waste places for themselves;
<br>15Or with princes that had gold, Who filled their houses with silver; 16Or as a hidden untimely birth I had
<br>not been;
<br>As infants that never saw light.
<br>17There the wicked cease from troubling;
<br>And there the weary are at rest.
<br>18There the prisoners are at ease together;
<br>They hear not the voice of the taskmaster.
<br>19The small and great are there alike;
<br> 
<br>And the servant is free from his master.
<br>
<br>20Wherewith is light given to him that is in misery,
<br>And life unto the bitter in soul—
<br>21Who long for death, but it cometh not;
<br>And dig for it more than for hid treasures;
<br>22Who rejoice unto exultation,
<br>And are glad, when they can find the grave?—
<br>23To a man whose way is hid, And whom God hath hedged in?
<br>24For my sighing cometh instead of my food,
<br>And my roarings are poured out like water.
<br>25For the thing which I did fear is come upon me,
<br>And that which I was afraid of hath overtaken me.
<br>26I was not at ease, neither was I quiet,
<br>Neither had I rest; but trouble came.
<br>
<br>Then	answered	Eliphaz	the Temanite, and said:
<br>2If one venture a word unto thee, wilt thou be weary?
<br>But who can withhold himself from speaking?
<br>3Behold, thou hast instructed many,
<br>And thou hast strengthened the weak hands.
<br>4Thy words have upholden him that was falling,
<br> 
<br>And thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.
<br>5But now it is come upon thee, and thou art weary;
<br>It toucheth thee, and thou art affrighted.
<br>6Is not thy fear of God thy confidence,
<br>And thy hope the integrity of thy ways?
<br>7Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent?
<br>Or where were the upright cut off?
<br>8According as I have seen, they that plow iniquity,
<br>And sow mischief, reap the same.
<br>9By the breath of God they perish,
<br>And by the blast of His anger are they consumed.
<br>10The lion roareth, and the fierce lion howleth—
<br>Yet the teeth of the young lions are broken.
<br>11The old lion perisheth for lack of prey,
<br>And the whelps of the lioness are scattered abroad.
<br>
<br>12Now a word was secretly brought to me,
<br>And mine ear received a whisper thereof.
<br>13In thoughts from the visions of the night,
<br>When deep sleep falleth on men,
<br>14Fear came upon me, and trembling,
<br>And all my bones were made to shake.
<br> 
<br>15Then a spirit passed before my face,
<br>That made the hair of my flesh to stand up.
<br>16It stood still, but I could not discern the appearance thereof;
<br>A form was before mine eyes; I heard a still voice:
<br>17’Shall mortal man be just before God?
<br>Shall a man be pure before his Maker?
<br>18Behold, He putteth no trust in His servants,
<br>And His angels He chargeth with folly;
<br>19How much more them that dwell in houses of clay,
<br>Whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed before the moth!
<br>20Betwixt morning and evening they are shattered;
<br>They perish for ever without any regarding it.
<br>21Is not their tent-cord plucked up within them?
<br>They die, and that without wisdom.’
<br>
<br>Call now; is there any that will answer thee?
<br>And to which of the holy ones wilt thou turn?
<br>2For anger killeth the foolish man, And envy slayeth the silly one.
<br>3I have seen the foolish taking root;
<br>But suddenly I beheld his habitation cursed.
<br>4His children are far from safety,
<br> 
<br>And are crushed in the gate, with none to deliver them.
<br>5Whose harvest the hungry eateth up,
<br>And taketh it even out of the thorns, and the snare gapeth for their substance.
<br>6For affliction cometh not forth from the dust,
<br>Neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;
<br>7But man is born unto trouble, As the sparks fly upward.
<br>
<br>8But as for me, I would seek unto God,
<br>And unto God would I commit my cause;
<br>9Who doeth great things and unsearchable,
<br>Marvellous things without number; 10Who giveth rain upon the earth, And sendeth waters upon the fields; 11So that He setteth up on high those
<br>that are low,
<br>And those that mourn are exalted to safety.
<br>12He frustrateth the devices of the crafty,
<br>So that their hands can perform nothing substantial.
<br>13He taketh the wise in their own craftiness;
<br>And the counsel of the wily is carried headlong.
<br>14They meet with darkness in the day-time,
<br>And grope at noonday as in the night.
<br> 
<br>15But He saveth from the sword of their mouth,
<br>Even the needy from the hand of the mighty.
<br>16So the poor hath hope,
<br>And iniquity stoppeth her mouth.
<br>
<br>17Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth;
<br>Therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty.
<br>18For He maketh sore, and bindeth up;
<br>He woundeth, and His hands make whole.
<br>19He will deliver thee in six troubles;
<br>Yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.
<br>20In famine He will redeem thee from death;
<br>And in war from the power of the sword.
<br>21Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue;
<br>Neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.
<br>22At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh;
<br>Neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.
<br>23For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field;
<br>And the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.
<br>24And thou shalt know that thy tent is in peace;
<br>And thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt miss nothing.
<br> 
<br>25Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great,
<br>And thine offspring as the grass of the earth.
<br>26Thou shalt come to thy grave in a ripe age,
<br>Like as a shock of corn cometh in in its season.
<br>27Lo this, we have searched it,
<br>So it is; hear it, and know thou it for thy good.
<br>
<br>Then Job answered and said:
<br>2Oh that my vexation were but weighed,
<br>And my calamity laid in the balances altogether!
<br>3For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas; t
<br>Herefore are my words broken.
<br>4For the arrows of the Almighty are within me,
<br>The poison whereof my spirit drinketh up;
<br>The terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.
<br>5Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass?
<br>Or loweth the ox over his fodder?
<br>6Can that which hath no savour be eaten without salt?
<br>Or is there any taste in the juice of mallows?
<br>7My soul refuseth to touch them; They are as the sickness of my flesh.
<br>
<br>8Oh that I might have my request,
<br>And that God would grant me the thing that I long for!
<br> 
<br>9Even that it would please God to crush me;
<br>That He would let loose His hand, and cut me off!
<br>10Then should I yet have comfort; Yea, I would exult in pain, though
<br>He spare not;
<br>For I have not denied the words of the Holy One.
<br>
<br>11What is my strength, that I should wait?
<br>And what is mine end, that I should be patient?
<br>12Is my strength the strength of stones?
<br>Or is my flesh of brass?
<br>13Is it that I have no help in me,
<br>And that sound wisdom is driven quite from me?
<br>
<br>14To him that is ready to faint kindness is due from his friend,
<br>Even to him that forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.
<br>15My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook,
<br>As the channel of brooks that overflow,
<br>16Which are black by reason of the ice,
<br>And wherein the snow hideth itself;
<br>17What time they wax warm, they vanish,
<br>When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.
<br>18The paths of their way do wind,
<br>They go up into the waste, and are lost.
