<br>§1393. Supplementary sinking fund for bond payments; purchase of bonds by United States; creation of special trust account
<br>
<br>(a) to (f). Repealed. Apr. 30, 1946, ch. 244, title V, §511(2), 60 Stat. 158.
<br>
<br>(g)(1) The Philippine Government shall pay to the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, at the end of each calendar quarter, all of the moneys received during such quarter from export taxes (less refunds), imposed and collected in accordance with the provisions of this section, and said moneys shall be deposited in an account with the Treasurer of the United States and shall constitute a supplementary sinking fund for the payment of bonds of the Philippines, its Provinces, cities, and municipalities, issued prior to May 1, 1934, under authority of Acts of Congress: Provided, however, That moneys received from any export tax imposed on any article which is shipped from the Philippines to the United States prior to July 4, 1946, and which is entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after July 4, 1946, shall be refunded by the independent Government of the Philippines.
<br>
<br>(2) The said Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to accept the deposits of the proceeds of the export taxes referred to in subdivision (1) of this subsection in accordance with section 1333 1 of this title.
<br>
<br>(3) The Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, with the approval of the Philippine Government, is authorized to purchase with such supplementary sinking-fund bonds of the Philippines, its Provinces, cities, and municipalities, issued prior to May 1, 1934, under authority of Acts of Congress and to invest such fund in interest-bearing obligations of the United States or in obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States. Whenever the Secretary of the Treasurer 2 finds that such fund is in excess of an amount adequate to meet future interest and principal payments on all such bonds, he may, with the approval of the Philippine Government, purchase with such excess any other bonds of the Philippines, its Provinces, cities, municipalities, and instrumentalities. For the purpose of this subsection obligations may be acquired on original issue at par, or by purchase of outstanding obligations at the market price. Any obligations acquired by the fund may, with the approval of the Philippine Government, be sold by the Secretary of the Treasury at the market price and the proceeds of such sale and the proceeds of the payment upon maturity or redemption of any obligations held in the supplementary sinking fund, as well as all moneys in any manner earned by such fund or on any obligations acquired by said fund, shall be paid into the said fund.
<br>
<br>(4) During the three months preceding July 4, 1946, the Philippine Government and the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States shall confer to ascertain that portion of the bonds of the Philippines, its Provinces, cities, and municipalities, issued prior to May 1, 1934, under authority of Acts of Congress, which will remain outstanding on July 4, 1946; and the Philippine Government shall turn over to the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States for destruction all such bonds that are then held, canceled, or uncanceled, in any of the sinking funds maintained for the payment of such bonds. After such outstanding portion of this indebtedness is thus determined, and before July 4, 1946, (i) there shall be set up with the Treasurer of the United States a special trust account in the name of the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States to pay future interest and principal payments on such bonds; (ii) the Philippine Government shall pay to the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States for deposit in this special trust account all of the sinking funds maintained for the payment of such bonds; and (iii) the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States shall transfer into this special trust account all of the proceeds of the supplementary sinking fund referred to in subdivision (1) of this subsection. Any portion of such special trust account found by the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States on July 4, 1946, to be in excess of an amount adequate to meet future interest and principal payments on all such outstanding bonds shall be turned over to the Treasury of the independent Government of the Philippines to be set up as an additional sinking fund to be used for the purpose of liquidating and paying all other obligations of the Philippines, its Provinces, cities, municipalities, and instrumentalities. To the extent that such special trust account is determined by the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States to be insufficient to pay interest and principal on the outstanding bonds of the Philippines, its Provinces, cities, and municipalities, issued prior to May 1, 1934, under authority of Acts of Congress, the Philippine Government shall, on or before July 3, 1946, pay to the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States for deposit in such special trust account an amount which said Secretary of the Treasury determines is required to assure payment of principal and interest on such bonds: Provided, however, That if the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States finds that this requirement would impose an undue hardship upon the Philippines, then the Philippine Government shall continue to provide annually the necessary funds for the payment of interest and principal on such bonds until such time as the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States determines that the amount in the special trust account is adequate to meet interest and principal payments on such bonds.
<br>
<br>(5) On and after July 4, 1946, the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States is authorized, with the approval of the independent Government of the Philippines, to purchase at the market price for the special trust account bonds of the Philippines, its Provinces, cities, and municipalities, issued prior to May 1, 1934, under authority of Acts of Congress. The Secretary of the Treasury of the United States is also authorized, with the approval of the independent Government of the Philippines, to invest all or any part of such special trust account in any interest-bearing obligations of the United States or in any obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States. Such obligations may be acquired on original issue at the issue price or by purchase of outstanding obligations at the market price, and any obligations acquired by the special trust account may, with the approval of the independent Government of the Philippines, be sold by the Secretary of the Treasury at the market price, and the proceeds of the payment upon maturity or redemption of such obligations shall be held as a part of such special trust account. Whenever the special trust account is determined by the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States to be adequate to meet interest and principal payments on all outstanding bonds of the Philippines, its Provinces, cities, and municipalities, issued prior to May 1, 1934, under authority of Acts of Congress, the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to pay from such trust account the principal of such outstanding bonds and to pay all interest due and owing on such bonds. All such bonds and interest coupons paid or purchased by the special trust account shall be canceled and destroyed by the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States. From time to time after July 4, 1946, any moneys in such special trust account found by the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States to be in excess of an amount adequate to meet interest and principal payments on all such bonds shall be turned over to the treasurer of the independent Government of the Philippines.

<br>
<br>Pub. L. 108–458, title VII, §7108, Dec. 17, 2004, 118 Stat. 3790, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(a) Promotion of United States Values Through Broadcast Media.—
<br>
<br>"(1) Findings.—Consistent with the report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>"(A) Although the United States has demonstrated and promoted its values in defending Muslims against tyrants and criminals in Somalia, Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq, this message is neither convincingly presented nor widely understood.
<br>
<br>"(B) If the United States does not act to vigorously define its message in countries with predominantly Muslim populations, the image of the United States will be defined by Islamic extremists who seek to demonize the United States.
<br>
<br>"(C) Recognizing that many Muslim audiences rely on satellite television and radio, the United States Government has launched promising initiatives in television and radio broadcasting to the Islamic world, including Iran and Afghanistan.
<br>
<br>"(2) Sense of congress.—It is the sense of Congress that—
<br>
<br>"(A) the United States must do more to defend and promote its values and ideals to the broadest possible audience in countries with predominantly Muslim populations;
<br>
<br>"(B) United States efforts to defend and promote these values and ideals are beginning to ensure that accurate expressions of these values reach large Muslim audiences and should be robustly supported;
<br>
<br>"(C) the United States Government could and should do more to engage Muslim audiences in the struggle of ideas; and
<br>
<br>"(D) the United States Government should more intensively employ existing broadcast media in the Islamic world as part of this engagement.
<br>
<br>"(b) Enhancing Free and Independent Media.—
<br>
<br>"(1) Findings.—Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>"(A) Freedom of speech and freedom of the press are fundamental human rights.
<br>
<br>"(B) The United States has a national interest in promoting these freedoms by supporting free media abroad, which is essential to the development of free and democratic societies consistent with our own.
<br>
<br>"(C) Free media is undermined, endangered, or nonexistent in many repressive and transitional societies around the world, including in Eurasia, Africa, and the Middle East.
<br>
<br>"(D) Individuals lacking access to a plurality of free media are vulnerable to misinformation and propaganda and are potentially more likely to adopt anti-United States views.
<br>
<br>"(E) Foreign governments have a responsibility to actively and publicly discourage and rebut unprofessional and unethical media while respecting journalistic integrity and editorial independence.
<br>
<br>"(2) Statement of policy.—It shall be the policy of the United States, acting through the Secretary of State, to—
<br>
<br>"(A) ensure that the promotion of freedom of the press and freedom of media worldwide is a priority of United States foreign policy and an integral component of United States public diplomacy;
<br>
<br>"(B) respect the journalistic integrity and editorial independence of free media worldwide; and
<br>
<br>"(C) ensure that widely accepted standards for professional and ethical journalistic and editorial practices are employed when assessing international media.
<br>
<br>"(c) Establishment of Media Network.—
<br>
<br>"(1) Grants for establishment of network.—The Secretary of State shall, utilizing amounts authorized to be appropriated by subsection (e)(2) [(d)(2)], make grants to the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) under the National Endowment for Democracy Act (22 U.S.C. 4411 et seq.) for utilization by the Endowment to provide funding to a private sector group to establish and manage a free and independent media network as specified in paragraph (2).
<br>
<br>"(2) Media network.—The media network established using funds under paragraph (1) shall provide an effective forum to convene a broad range of individuals, organizations, and governmental participants involved in journalistic activities and the development of free and independent media in order to—
<br>
<br>"(A) fund a clearinghouse to collect and share information concerning international media development and training;
<br>
<br>"(B) improve research in the field of media assistance and program evaluation to better inform decisions regarding funding and program design for government and private donors;
<br>
<br>"(C) explore the most appropriate use of existing means to more effectively encourage the involvement of the private sector in the field of media assistance; and
<br>
<br>"(D) identify effective methods for the development of a free and independent media in societies in transition.
<br>
<br>"(d) Authorizations of Appropriations.—
<br>
<br>"(1) In general.—There are authorized to be appropriated for each of fiscal years 2005 and 2006, unless otherwise authorized by Congress, such sums as may be necessary to carry out United States Government broadcasting activities consistent with this section under the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 (22 U.S.C. 1431 et seq.), the United States International Broadcasting Act of 1994 (22 U.S.C. 6201 et seq.), and the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6501 et seq.), and to carry out other activities under this section consistent with the purposes of such Acts, unless otherwise authorized by Congress.
<br>
<br>"(2) Grants for media network.—In addition to the amounts authorized to be appropriated under paragraph (1), there are authorized to be appropriated for each of fiscal years 2005 and 2006, unless otherwise authorized by Congress, such sums as may be necessary for grants under subsection (c)(1) for the establishment of the media network described in subsection (c)(2)."

<br>(b) Assumption of notes issued pursuant to section 1509(c)(2) of this title; advances
<br>
<br>The Director is authorized to assume the obligation of not to exceed $28,000,000 of the notes authorized to be issued pursuant to section 1509(c)(2) 1 of this title, together with the interest accrued and unpaid thereon, and to obtain advances from time to time from the Secretary of the Treasury up to such amount, less amounts previously advanced on such notes, as provided for in said notes. Such advances shall be deposited in a special account in the Treasury available for payments under informational media guaranties.
<br>(c) Limitations of time; total of guaranties outstanding
<br>
<br>The Director is authorized to make informational media guaranties without regard to the limitations of time contained in section 1933(b)(4) 1 of this title, but the total of such guaranties outstanding at any one time shall not exceed the sum of the face amount of the notes assumed by the Director less the amounts previously advanced on such notes by the Secretary of the Treasury plus the amount of the funds in the special account referred to in subsection (b).
<br>(d) Sale of foreign currencies; special account; availability
<br>
<br>Foreign currencies available after June 30, 1955, from conversions made pursuant to the obligation of informational media guaranties may be sold, in accordance with Treasury Department regulations, for dollars which shall be deposited in the special account and shall be available for payments under new guaranties. Such currencies shall be available, as may be provided for by the Congress in appropriation Acts, for use for educational, scientific, and cultural purposes which are in the national interest of the United States, and for such other purposes of mutual interest as may be agreed to by the governments of the United States and the country from which the currencies derive.
<br>(e) Deposit of fees; availability
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding the provisions of section 1933(b)(4)(E) 1 of this title, (1) fees collected for the issuance of informational media guaranties shall be deposited in the special account and shall be available for payments under informational media guaranties; and (2) the Director may require the payment of a minimum charge of up to fifty dollars for issuance of guaranty contracts, or amendments thereto.
<br>(f) Advance payments
<br>
<br>The Director is further authorized, under such terms as he may prescribe, to make advance payments under informational media guaranties: Provided, That currencies receivable from holders of such guaranties on account of such advance payments shall be paid to the United States within nine months from the date of the advance payment and that appropriate security to assure such payments is required before any advance payment is made.
<br>(g) Separate accounts; transfers
<br>
<br>As soon as feasible after July 18, 1956, all assets, liabilities, income, expenses, and charges of whatever kind pertaining to informational media guaranties, including any charges against the authority to issue notes provided in section 1509(c)(2) 1 of this title, cumulative from April 3, 1948, shall be accounted for separately from other guaranties issued pursuant to section 1933(b) 1 of this title: Provided, That there shall be transferred from the special account established pursuant to subsection (b), into the account available for payments under guaranties other than the informational media guaranties, an amount equal to the total of the fees received for the issuance of guaranties other than informational media guaranties, and used to make payments under informational media guaranties.
<br>(h) Appropriations for restoration of realized impairment to capital; liquidation of notes
<br>
<br>(1) There is authorized to be appropriated annually an amount to restore in whole or in part any realized impairment to the capital used in carrying on the authority to make informational media guaranties, as provided in subsection (c), through the end of the last completed fiscal year.
<br>
<br>(2) Such impairment shall consist of the amount by which the losses incurred and interest accrued on notes exceed the revenue earned and any previous appropriations made for the restoration of impairment. Losses shall include the dollar losses on foreign currencies sold, and the dollar cost of foreign currencies which (a) the Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the Director, has determined to be unavailable for, or in excess of, requirements of the United States, or (b) have been transferred to other accounts without reimbursement to the special account.
<br>
<br>(3) Dollars appropriated pursuant to this section shall be applied to the payment of interest and in satisfaction of notes issued or assumed hereunder, and to the extent of such application to the principal of the notes, the Director is authorized to issue notes to the Secretary of the Treasury which will bear interest at a rate to be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average market yields of outstanding marketable obligations of the United States having maturities comparable to the guaranties. The currencies determined to be unavailable for, or in excess of, requirements of the United States as provided above shall be transferred to the Secretary of the Treasury to be held until disposed of, and any dollar proceeds realized from such disposition shall be deposited in miscellaneous receipts.
<br>
<br>(4) Section 1476(a) of this title 1 shall not apply with respect to any amounts appropriated under this section for the purpose of liquidating the notes (and any accrued interest thereon) which were assumed in the operation of the informational media guaranty program under this section and which were outstanding on August 24, 1982.
