<br>
<br>In determining whether a mortgage is a conforming mortgage for purposes of this paragraph, the Director shall consider the original principal balance of the mortgage loan to be the principal balance as reported in the information referred to in paragraph (4), as rounded to the nearest thousand dollars.
<br>(f) Notice of determination and enterprise comment
<br>(1) Notice
<br>
<br>Within 30 days of making a determination under subsection (d) regarding compliance of an enterprise for a year with a housing goal established under this section and before any public disclosure thereof, the Director shall provide notice of the determination to the enterprise, which shall include an analysis and comparison, by the Director, of the performance of the enterprise for the year and the targets for the year under subsection (e).
<br>(2) Comment period
<br>
<br>The Director shall provide each enterprise an opportunity to comment on the determination during the 30-day period beginning upon receipt by the enterprise of the notice.
<br>(g) Use of borrower income
<br>
<br>In monitoring the performance of each enterprise pursuant to the housing goals under this section and evaluating such performance (for purposes of section 4566 of this title), the Director shall consider a mortgagor's income to be such income at the time of origination of the mortgage.
<br>(h) Consideration of properties with rental units
<br>
<br>Mortgages financing two- to four-unit owner-occupied properties shall count toward the achievement of the single-family housing goals under this section, if such properties otherwise meet the requirements under this section, notwithstanding the use of one or more units for rental purposes.
<br>(i) Goals credit
<br>
<br>The Director shall determine whether an enterprise shall receive full, partial, or no credit for a transaction toward achievement of any of the housing goals established pursuant to section 4562 and 4563 of this title. In making any such determination, the Director shall consider whether a transaction or activity of an enterprise is substantially equivalent to a mortgage purchase and either (1) creates a new market, or (2) adds liquidity to an existing market. No credit toward the achievement of the housing goals and subgoals established under this section may be given to the purchase of mortgages, including any transaction or activity of an enterprise determined to be substantially equivalent to a mortgage purchase, that is determined to be unacceptable or contrary to good lending practices, inconsistent with safety and soundness, or unauthorized for purchase by the enterprises, pursuant to regulations issued by the Director.

<br>§4563. Multifamily special affordable housing goal
<br>(a) Establishment of goal
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Director shall, by regulation, establish a single annual goal, by either unit or dollar volume, of purchases by each enterprise of mortgages on multifamily housing that finance dwelling units affordable to low-income families.
<br>(2) Additional requirements for units affordable to very low-income families
<br>
<br>When establishing the goal under this section, the Director shall establish additional requirements for the purchase by each enterprise of mortgages on multifamily housing that finance dwelling units affordable to very low-income families.
<br>(3) Reporting on smaller properties
<br>
<br>The Director shall require each enterprise to report on the purchase by each enterprise of multifamily housing of a smaller or limited size that is affordable to low-income families, which may be based on multifamily projects of 5 to 50 units (as such numbers may be adjusted by the Director) or on mortgages of up to $5,000,000 (as such amount may be adjusted by the Director), and may, by regulation, establish such aditional 1 requirements related to such units.
<br>(4) Factors
<br>
<br>In establishing the goal and additional requirements under this section, the Director shall not consider segments of the market determined to be inconsistent with safety and soundness or unauthorized for purchase by the enterprises, and shall take into consideration—
<br>
<br>(A) national multifamily mortgage credit needs and the ability of the enterprise to provide additional liquidity and stability for the multifamily mortgage market;
<br>
<br>(B) the performance and effort of the enterprise in making mortgage credit available for multifamily housing in previous years;
<br>
<br>(C) the size of the multifamily mortgage market for housing affordable to low-income and very low-income families, including the size of the multifamily markets for housing of a smaller or limited size;

<br>
<br>(E) the availability of public subsidies; and
<br>
<br>(F) the need to maintain the sound financial condition of the enterprise.
<br>(b) Units financed by housing finance agency bonds
<br>
<br>The Director shall give full credit toward the achievement of the multifamily special affordable housing goal under this section (for purposes of section 4566 of this title) to dwelling units in multifamily housing that otherwise qualifies under such goal and that is financed by tax-exempt or taxable bonds issued by a State or local housing finance agency, if such bonds, in whole or in part—
<br>
<br>(1) are secured by a guarantee of the enterprise; or
<br>
<br>(2) are purchased by the enterprise, except that the Director may give less than full credit for purchases of investment grade bonds, to the extent that such purchases do not provide a new market or add liquidity to an existing market.
<br>(c) Measurement of performance
<br>
<br>The Director shall monitor the performance of each enterprise in meeting the goals established under this section and shall evaluate such performance (for purposes of section 4566 of this title) based on whether the rent levels are affordable. A rent level shall be considered to be affordable for purposes of this subsection for low-income families if it does not exceed 30 percent of the maximum income level of such income category, with appropriate adjustments for unit size as measured by the number of bedrooms.
<br>(d) Determination of compliance
<br>
<br>The Director shall determine, for each year that the housing goal under this section is in effect pursuant to section 4561(a) of this title, whether each enterprise has complied with such goal and the additional requirements under subsection (a)(2).

<br>(c) Cease and desist, civil money penalties, and remedies including housing plans
<br>(1) Requirement
<br>
<br>If the Director finds, pursuant to subsection (b), that there is a substantial probability that an enterprise will fail, or has actually failed, to meet any housing goal under this subpart, and that the achievement of the housing goal was or is feasible, the Director may require that the enterprise submit a housing plan under this subsection. If the Director makes such a finding and the enterprise refuses to submit such a plan, submits an unacceptable plan, or fails to comply with the plan, the Director may issue a cease and desist order in accordance with section 4581 of this title and impose civil money penalties in accordance with section 4585 of this title.
<br>(2) Housing plan
<br>
<br>If the Director requires a housing plan under this subsection, such a plan shall be—
<br>
<br>(A) a feasible plan describing the specific actions the enterprise will take—
<br>
<br>(i) to achieve the goal for the next calendar year; and
<br>
<br>(ii) if the Director determines that there is a substantial probability that the enterprise will fail to meet a goal in the current year, to make such improvements and changes in its operations as are reasonable in the remainder of such year; and
<br>
<br>(B) sufficiently specific to enable the Director to monitor compliance periodically.
<br>(3) Deadline for submission
<br>
<br>The Director shall establish a deadline for an enterprise to submit a housing plan to the Director, which may not be more than 45 days after the enterprise is provided notice. The Director may extend the deadline to the extent that the Director determines necessary. Any extension of the deadline shall be in writing and for a time certain.
<br>(4) Approval
<br>
<br>The Director shall review each submission by an enterprise, including a housing plan submitted under this subsection, and, not later than 30 days after submission, approve or disapprove the plan or other action. The Director may extend the period for approval or disapproval for a single additional 30-day period if the Director determines it necessary. The Director shall approve any plan that the Director determines is likely to succeed, and conforms with the Federal National Mortgage Association Charter Act [12 U.S.C. 1716 et seq.] or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Act [12 U.S.C. 1451 et seq.] (as applicable), this chapter, and any other applicable provision of law.
<br>(5) Notice of approval and disapproval
<br>
<br>The Director shall provide written notice to any enterprise submitting a housing plan of the approval or disapproval of the plan (which shall include the reasons for any disapproval of the plan) and of any extension of the period for approval or disapproval.
<br>(6) Resubmission
<br>
<br>If the initial housing plan submitted by an enterprise under this section is disapproved, the enterprise shall submit an amended plan acceptable to the Director not later than 15 days after such disapproval, or such longer period that the Director determines is in the public interest.
<br>(7) Cease and desist orders; civil money penalties
<br>
<br>Solely with respect to the housing goals established under sections 4562(a) and 4563(a)(1) of this title, if the Director requires an enterprise to submit a housing plan under this subsection and the enterprise refuses to submit such a plan, submits an unacceptable plan, or fails to comply with the plan, the Director may issue a cease and desist order in accordance with section 4581 of this title, impose civil money penalties in accordance with section 4585 of this title, exercise other appropriate enforcement authority or seek other appropriate actions.

The purpose of the Housing Trust Fund under this section is to provide grants to States (as such term is defined in section 4502 of this title) for use—
<br>
<br>(A) to increase and preserve the supply of rental housing for extremely low- and very low-income families, including homeless families; and

<br>
<br>(B) 50 percent of such excess shall be used to reimburse the Treasury for such payments in calendar year 2010; and
<br>
<br>(C) 25 percent of such excess shall be used to reimburse the Treasury for such payments in calendar year 2011.
<br>(2) Excess funds
<br>
<br>At the termination of the HOPE for Homeowners Program established under section 1715z–23 of this title, if amounts used to reimburse the Treasury under paragraph (1) exceed the total net cost to the Government of the HOPE for Homeowners Program, such amounts shall be used for their original purpose, as described in paragraphs (1)(B) and (2)(B) of section 4567(a) of this title.
<br>(3) Treasury fund
<br>
<br>The amounts referred to in subparagraphs (A) through (C) of paragraph (1) shall be deposited into a fund established in the Treasury of the United States by the Secretary of the Treasury for such purpose.
<br>(c) Allocation for Housing Trust Fund in fiscal year 2010 and subsequent years
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subsection (b), the Secretary shall distribute the amounts allocated for the Housing Trust Fund under this section to provide affordable housing as described in this subsection.
<br>(2) Permissible designees
<br>
<br>A State receiving grant amounts under this subsection may designate a State housing finance agency, housing and community development entity, tribally designated housing entity (as such term is defined in section 4103 of title 25), or any other qualified instrumentality of the State to receive such grant amounts.
<br>(3) Distribution to States by needs-based formula
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall, by regulation, establish a formula within 12 months of July 30, 2008, to distribute amounts made available under this subsection to each State to provide affordable housing to extremely low- and very low-income households.
<br>(B) Basis for formula
<br>
<br>The formula required under subparagraph (A) shall include the following:
<br>
<br>(i) The ratio of the shortage of standard rental units both affordable and available to extremely low-income renter households in the State to the aggregate shortage of standard rental units both affordable and available to extremely low-income renter households in all the States.
<br>
<br>(ii) The ratio of the shortage of standard rental units both affordable and available to very low-income renter households in the State to the aggregate shortage of standard rental units both affordable and available to very low-income renter households in all the States.
<br>
<br>(iii) The ratio of extremely low-income renter households in the State living with either (I) incomplete kitchen or plumbing facilities, (II) more than 1 person per room, or (III) paying more than 50 percent of income for housing costs, to the aggregate number of extremely low-income renter households living with either (IV) incomplete kitchen or plumbing facilities, (V) more than 1 person per room, or (VI) paying more than 50 percent of income for housing costs in all the States.
<br>
<br>(iv) The ratio of very low-income renter households in the State paying more than 50 percent of income on rent relative to the aggregate number of very low-income renter households paying more than 50 percent of income on rent in all the States.
<br>
<br>(v) The resulting sum calculated from the factors described in clauses (i) through (iv) shall be multiplied by the relative cost of construction in the State. For purposes of this subclause,1 the term "cost of construction"—
<br>
<br>(I) means the cost of construction or building rehabilitation in the State relative to the national cost of construction or building rehabilitation; and
<br>
<br>(II) shall be calculated such that values higher than 1.0 indicate that the State's construction costs are higher than the national average, a value of 1.0 indicates that the State's construction costs are exactly the same as the national average, and values lower than 1.0 indicate that the State's cost of construction are lower than the national average.
<br>(C) Priority
<br>
<br>The formula required under subparagraph (A) shall give priority emphasis and consideration to the factor described in subparagraph (B)(i).
<br>(4) Allocation of grant amounts
<br>(A) Notice
<br>
<br>Not later than 60 days after the date that the Secretary determines the formula amounts described in paragraph (3), the Secretary shall caused 2 to be published in the Federal Register a notice that such amounts shall be so available.
<br>(B) Grant amount
<br>
<br>In each fiscal year other than fiscal year 2009, the Secretary shall make a grant to each State in an amount that is equal to the formula amount determined under paragraph (3) for that State.
<br>(C) Minimum State allocations
<br>
<br>If the formula amount determined under paragraph (3) for a fiscal year would allocate less than $3,000,000 to any of the 50 States of the United States or the District of Columbia, the allocation for such State of the United States or the District of Columbia shall be $3,000,000, and the increase shall be deducted pro rata from the allocations made to all other of the States (as such term is defined in section 4502 of this title).
