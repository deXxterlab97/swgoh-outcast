<br>
<br>(A) be a private nonprofit entity that has an expertise in organ procurement and transplantation, and
<br>
<br>(B) have a board of directors—
<br>
<br>(i) that includes representatives of organ procurement organizations (including organizations that have received grants under section 273 of this title), transplant centers, voluntary health associations, and the general public; and
<br>
<br>(ii) that shall establish an executive committee and other committees, whose chairpersons shall be selected to ensure continuity of leadership for the board.
<br>
<br>(2) The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network shall—

<br>
<br>(i) a national list of individuals who need organs, and
<br>

<br>
<br>(C) maintain a twenty-four-hour telephone service to facilitate matching organs with individuals included in the list,

<br>(D) assist organ procurement organizations in the nationwide distribution of organs equitably among transplant patients,
<br>
<br>(E) adopt and use standards of quality for the acquisition and transportation of donated organs,
<br>
<br>(F) prepare and distribute, on a regionalized basis (and, to the extent practicable, among regions or on a national basis), samples of blood sera from individuals who are included on the list and whose immune system makes it difficult for them to receive organs, in order to facilitate matching the compatibility of such individuals with organ donors,
<br>
<br>(G) coordinate, as appropriate, the transportation of organs from organ procurement organizations to transplant centers,
<br>
<br>(H) provide information to physicians and other health professionals regarding organ donation,
<br>

<br>(3) Clarification.—In adopting and using standards of quality under paragraph (2)(E), the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network may adopt and use such standards with respect to organs infected with human immunodeficiency virus (in this paragraph referred to as "HIV"), provided that any such standards ensure that organs infected with HIV may be transplanted only into individuals who—
<br>
<br>(A) are infected with HIV before receiving such organ; and
<br>
<br>(B)(i) are participating in clinical research approved by an institutional review board under the criteria, standards, and regulations described in subsections (a) and (b) of section 274f–5 of this title; or
<br>
<br>(ii) if the Secretary has determined under section 274f–5(c) of this title that participation in such clinical research, as a requirement for such transplants, is no longer warranted, are receiving a transplant under the standards and regulations under section 274f–5(c) of this title.

<br>The Secretary shall establish procedures for—
<br>
<br>(1) receiving from interested persons critical comments relating to the manner in which the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network is carrying out the duties of the Network under subsection (b); and
