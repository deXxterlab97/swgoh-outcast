<br>§1430. Advances to members
<br>(a) In general
<br>(1) All advances
<br>
<br>Each Federal Home Loan Bank is authorized to make secured advances to its members upon collateral sufficient, in the judgment of the Bank, to fully secure advances obtained from the Bank under this section or section 1431(g) of this title.
<br>(2) Purposes of advances
<br>
<br>A long-term advance may only be made for the purposes of—
<br>
<br>(A) providing funds to any member for residential housing finance; and
<br>
<br>(B) providing funds to any community financial institution for small businesses, small farms, small agri-businesses, and community development activities.
<br>(3) Collateral
<br>
<br>A Bank, at the time of origination or renewal of a loan or advance, shall obtain and maintain a security interest in collateral eligible pursuant to one or more of the following categories:
<br>
<br>(A) Fully disbursed, whole first mortgages on improved residential property (not more than 90 days delinquent), or securities representing a whole interest in such mortgages.
<br>
<br>(B) Securities issued, insured, or guaranteed by the United States Government or any agency thereof (including without limitation, mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the Federal National Mortgage Corporation, and the Government National Mortgage Association).
<br>
<br>(C) Cash or deposits of a Federal Home Loan Bank.
<br>
<br>(D) Other real estate related collateral acceptable to the Bank if such collateral has a readily ascertainable value and the Bank can perfect its interest in the collateral.
<br>
<br>(E) Secured loans for small business, agriculture, or community development activities or securities representing a whole interest in such secured loans, in the case of any community financial institution.
<br>(4) Additional bank authority
<br>
<br>Subparagraphs (A) through (E) of paragraph (3) shall not affect the ability of any Federal Home Loan Bank to take such steps as it deems necessary to protect its security position with respect to outstanding advances, including requiring deposits of additional collateral security, whether or not such additional security would be eligible to originate an advance. If an advance existing on August 9, 1989, matures and the member does not have sufficient eligible collateral to fully secure a renewal of such advance, a Bank may renew such advance secured by such collateral as the Bank determines is appropriate. A member that has an advance secured by such insufficient eligible collateral must reduce its level of outstanding advances promptly and prudently in accordance with a schedule determined by the Federal home loan bank.
<br>(5) Review of certain collateral standards
<br>
<br>The Director may review the collateral standards applicable to each Federal home loan bank for the classes of collateral described in subparagraphs (D) and (E) of paragraph (3), and may, if necessary for safety and soundness purposes, require an increase in the collateral standards for any or all of those classes of collateral.
<br>(6) Definitions
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subsection, the terms "small business", "agriculture", "small farm", "small agri-business", and "community development activities" shall have the meanings given those terms by regulation of the Director.
<br>(b) Appraisals and other investigations; acceptance of home mortgages as collateral security only by approval of Director
<br>
<br>For the purposes of this section, each Home Loan Bank shall have power to make, or to cause or require to be made, such appraisals and other investigations as it may deem necessary. No home mortgage otherwise eligible to be accepted as collateral security for an advance by a Home Loan Bank shall be accepted if any director, officer, employee, attorney or agent of the Home Loan Bank or of the borrowing institution is personally liable thereon, unless the Director has specifically approved such acceptance.
<br>(c) Notes of borrowing members; interest rate; lien on stock
<br>
<br>Such advances shall be made upon the note or obligation of the member secured as provided in this section, bearing such rate of interest as the Federal home loan bank may approve or determine, and the Federal Home Loan Bank shall have a lien upon and shall hold the stock of such member as further collateral security for all indebtedness of the member to the Federal Home Loan Bank.
<br>(d) Obligation to repay; additional security; sale of advances to other banks
<br>
<br>The institution applying for an advance shall enter into a primary and unconditional obligation to pay off all advances, together with interest and any unpaid costs and expenses in connection therewith according to the terms under which they were made, in such form as shall meet the requirements of the bank. The bank shall reserve the right to require at any time, when deemed necessary for its protection, deposits of additional collateral security or substitutions of security by the borrowing institution, and each borrowing institution shall assign additional or substituted security when and as so required. Any Federal Home Loan Bank shall have power to sell to any other Federal Home Loan Bank, with or without recourse, any advance made under the provisions of this chapter, or to allow to such bank a participation therein, and any other Federal Home Loan Bank shall have power to purchase such advance or to accept a participation therein, together with an appropriate assignment of security therefor.
<br>(e) Priority of certain secured interests
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any security interest granted to a Federal Home Loan Bank by any member of any Federal Home Loan Bank or any affiliate of any such member shall be entitled to priority over the claims and rights of any party (including any receiver, conservator, trustee, or similar party having rights of a lien creditor) other than claims and rights that—
<br>

<br>
<br>(2) are held by actual bona fide purchasers for value or by actual secured parties that are secured by actual perfected security interests.
<br>(g) 1 Community support requirements
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Before the end of the 2-year period beginning on August 9, 1989, the Director shall adopt regulations establishing standards of community investment or service for members of Banks to maintain continued access to long-term advances.
<br>(2) Factors to be included
<br>
<br>The regulations promulgated pursuant to paragraph (1) shall take into account factors such as a member's performance under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 [12 U.S.C. 2901 et seq.] and the member's record of lending to first-time homebuyers.
<br>(h) Special liquidity advances
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Subject to paragraph (2), the Federal Home Loan Banks may, upon the request of the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, make short-term liquidity advances to a savings association that—

<br>
<br>(B) has reasonable and demonstrable prospects of returning to a satisfactory financial condition.
<br>(2) Interest on and security for special liquidity advances
<br>
<br>Any loan by a Federal Home Loan Bank pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be subject to all applicable collateral requirements, including the requirements of subsection (a), and shall be at an interest rate no less favorable than those made available for similar short-term liquidity advances to savings associations that do not present such supervisory concern.

<br>(1) In general

<br>(b) Issuance of consolidated Federal Home Loan Bank debentures; restrictions
<br>

No such debentures shall be issued at any time if any of the assets of any Federal Home Loan Bank are pledged to secure any debts or subject to any lien, and neither the Office of Finance nor any Federal Home Loan Bank shall have power to pledge any of the assets of any Federal Home Loan Bank, or voluntarily to permit any lien to attach to the same while any of such debentures so issued are outstanding.

<br>(f) Rediscount of notes held by other banks; purchase of bonds of other banks
<br>
<br>The Director is authorized and empowered to permit or to require Federal Home Loan Banks, upon such terms and conditions as the Director may prescribe, to rediscount the discounted notes of members held by other Federal Home Loan Banks, or to make loans to, or make deposits with, such other Federal Home Loan Banks, or to purchase any bonds or debentures issued under this section.

<br>(i) Treasury purchase of banks' obligations; exercise of authority
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized in his discretion to purchase any obligations issued pursuant to this section, as heretofore, now, or hereafter in force and for such purpose the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to use as a public-debt transaction the proceeds of the sale of any securities hereafter issued under chapter 31 of title 31, as now or hereafter in force, and the purposes for which securities may be issued under chapter 31 of title 31, as now or hereafter in force, are extended to include such purchases. The Secretary of the Treasury may, at any time, sell, upon such terms and conditions and at such price or prices as he shall determine, any of the obligations acquired by him under this subsection. All redemptions, purchases, and sales by the Secretary of the Treasury of such obligations under this subsection shall be treated as public-debt transactions of the United States. The Secretary of the Treasury shall not at any time purchase any obligations under this paragraph if such purchase would increase the aggregate principal amount of his then outstanding holdings of such obligations under this paragraph to an amount greater than $4,000,000,000. Each purchase of obligations by the Secretary of the Treasury under this subsection shall be upon terms and conditions as shall be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury and shall bear such rate of interest as may be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury taking into consideration the current average market yield for the month preceding the month of such purchase on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States.
<br>
<br>In addition to obligations authorized to be purchased by the preceding paragraph, the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to purchase any obligations issued pursuant to this section in amounts not to exceed $2,000,000,000. The authority provided in this paragraph shall expire August 10, 1975.
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the authority provided in this subsection may be exercised during any calendar quarter beginning after October 28, 1974, only if the Secretary of the Treasury and the Chairperson of the Director 1 certify to the Congress that (1) alternative means cannot be effectively employed to permit members of the Federal Home Loan Bank System to continue to supply reasonable amounts of funds to the mortgage market, and (2) the ability to supply such funds is substantially impaired because of monetary stringency and a high level of interest rates. Any funds borrowed under this subsection shall be repaid by the Home Loan Banks at the earliest practicable date.
<br>(j) Audits
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding the provisions of section 9105(a)(1)(B) 2 of title 31, audits by the Government Accountability Office of the financial transactions of a Federal Home Loan Bank shall not be limited to periods during which Government capital has been invested therein. The provisions of sections 9107(c)(2) and 9108(d)(1) of title 31 shall not apply to any Federal Home Loan Bank.
<br>(k) Bank loans to the Deposit Insurance Fund
<br>(1) Loans authorized

<br>
<br>Any loan by a Federal Home Loan Bank pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be a direct liability of the Deposit Insurance Fund.
<br>(3) Interest on and security for such loans
<br>
<br>Any loan by a Federal Home Loan Bank pursuant to paragraph (1) shall—
<br>
<br>(A) bear a rate of interest not less than such Bank's current marginal cost of funds, taking into account the maturities involved; and
<br>
<br>(B) be adequately secured.

<br>(1) Authority to purchase
<br>(A) General authority
<br>
<br>In addition to the authority under subsection (i) of this section, the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to purchase any obligations issued by any Federal Home Loan Bank under any section of this chapter, on such terms and conditions as the Secretary may determine and in such amounts as the Secretary may determine. Nothing in this subsection requires a Federal Home Loan Bank to issue obligations or securities to the Secretary without mutual agreement between the Secretary and the Federal Home Loan Bank. Nothing in this subsection permits or authorizes the Secretary, without the agreement of the Federal Home Loan Bank, to engage in open market purchases of the common securities of any Federal Home Loan Bank.
<br>(B) Emergency determination required
<br>
<br>In connection with any use of this authority, the Secretary must determine that such actions are necessary to—
<br>
<br>(i) provide stability to the financial markets;
<br>
<br>(ii) prevent disruptions in the availability of mortgage finance; and
<br>
<br>(iii) protect the taxpayer.
<br>(C) Considerations
<br>
<br>To protect the taxpayers, the Secretary of the Treasury shall take into consideration the following in connection with exercising the authority contained in this paragraph:

<br>
<br>(vi) Restrictions on the use of Federal Home Loan Bank resources, including limitations on the payment of dividends and executive compensation and any such other terms and conditions as appropriate for those purposes.
<br>(D) Reports to Congress
<br>
<br>Upon exercise of this authority, the Secretary shall report to the Committees on the Budget, Financial Services, and Ways and Means of the House of Representatives and the Committees on the Budget, Finance, and Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate as to the necessity for the purchase and the determinations made by the Secretary under subparagraph (B) and with respect to the considerations required under subparagraph (C), and the size, terms, and probability of repayment or fulfillment of other terms of such purchase.
<br>(2) Rights; sale of obligations and securities
<br>(A) Exercise of rights
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Treasury may, at any time, exercise any rights received in connection with such purchases.
<br>(B) Sale of obligations
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Treasury may, at any time, subject to the terms of the security or otherwise upon terms and conditions and at prices determined by the Secretary, sell any obligation acquired by the Secretary under this subsection.
<br>(C) Deficit reduction
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Treasury shall deposit in the General Fund of the Treasury any amounts received by the Secretary from the sale of any obligation acquired by the Secretary under this subsection, where such amounts shall be—

<br>(i) dedicated for the sole purpose of deficit reduction; and
<br>
<br>(ii) prohibited from use as an offset for other spending increases or revenue reductions.
<br>(D) Application of sunset to purchased obligations
<br>
<br>The authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to hold, exercise any rights received in connection with, or sell, any obligations purchased is not subject to the provisions of paragraph (4).
<br>(3) Funding
<br>
<br>For the purpose of the authorities granted in this subsection, the Secretary of the Treasury may use the proceeds of the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31, and the purposes for which securities may be issued under chapter 31 of title 31 are extended to include such purchases and the exercise of any rights in connection with such purchases. Any funds expended for the purchase of, or modifications to, obligations and securities, or the exercise of any rights received in connection with such purchases under this subsection shall be deemed appropriated at the time of such purchase, modification, or exercise.
<br>(4) Termination of authority
<br>
<br>The authority under this subsection (l), with the exception of paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection, shall expire December 31, 2009.
<br>(5) Authority of the Director with respect to executive compensation
