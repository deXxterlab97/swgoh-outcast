<br>§1087pp. Student aid index for independent students without dependents other than a spouse
<br>(a) Computation of student aid index
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>For each independent student without dependents other than a spouse, the student aid index is equal to (except as provided in paragraph (2)) the sum of—
<br>
<br>(A) the family's available income (determined in accordance with subsection (b)); and
<br>
<br>(B) the family's available assets (determined in accordance with subsection (c)).
<br>(2) Exception
<br>
<br>If the sum determined under paragraph (1) with respect to an independent student without dependents other than a spouse is less than − $1,500, the student aid index for the independent student shall be − $1,500.
<br>(b) Family's available income
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The family's available income is determined by—
<br>
<br>(A) deducting from total income (as defined in section 1087vv of this title)—
<br>
<br>(i) Federal income taxes;
<br>
<br>(ii) an allowance for payroll taxes, determined in accordance with paragraph (2);
<br>
<br>(iii) an income protection allowance that is equal to—
<br>
<br>(I) in the case of a single independent student without dependents, $14,630, as adjusted pursuant to section 1078rr(b) of this title; and
<br>
<br>(II) in the case of a married independent student without dependents, $23,460, as adjusted pursuant to section 1078rr(b) of this title; and
<br>
<br>(iv) in the case of a married independent student, an employment expense allowance, as determined in accordance with paragraph (3); and
<br>
<br>(B) multiplying the amount determined under subparagraph (A) by 50 percent.
<br>(2) Allowance for payroll taxes
<br>
<br>The allowance for payroll taxes is equal to the sum of—
<br>
<br>(A) the total amount earned by the student (and spouse, if appropriate), multiplied by the rate of tax under section 3101(b) of title 26; and
<br>
<br>(B) the amount earned by the student (and spouse, if appropriate) that does not exceed such contribution and benefit base (twice such contribution and benefit base, in the case of a joint return) for the year of the earnings, multiplied by the rate of tax applicable to such earnings under section 3101(a) of title 26.
<br>(3) Employment expense allowance
<br>
<br>The employment expense allowance is equal to the following:
<br>
<br>(A) If the student is married, such allowance is equal to the lesser of $4,000 or 35 percent of the couple's combined earned income (as adjusted by the Secretary pursuant to section 1087rr(g) of this title).
<br>
<br>(B) If the student is not married, the employment expense allowance is zero.
<br>(c) Family's available assets
<br>(1) In general
<br>(A) Determination
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the family's available assets are equal to—
<br>
<br>(i) the difference between the family's assets (as defined in section 1087vv(f) of this title) and the asset protection allowance (determined in accordance with paragraph (2)); multiplied by
<br>
<br>(ii) 20 percent.
<br>(B) Not less than zero
<br>
<br>The family's available assets under this subsection shall not be less than zero.
<br>(2) Asset protection allowance
<br>
<br>The asset protection allowance is calculated based on the following table (as revised by the Secretary pursuant to section 1087rr(d) of this title):
<br>Asset Protection Allowances for Families and Students If the age of the student is—	And the student is
