<br>Pub. L. 114–31, §2(d), July 20, 2015, 129 Stat. 430, provided that: "The amendments made by this Act [enacting this section] shall take effect on the date that is 60 days after the date of the enactment of this Act [July 20, 2015]."
<br>Veterans Identification Card; Findings
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 114–31, §2(a), July 20, 2015, 129 Stat. 428, provided that:
<br>
<br>"Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>"(1) Effective on the day before the date of the enactment of this Act [July 20, 2015], veteran identification cards were issued to veterans who have either completed the statutory time-in-service requirement for retirement from the Armed Forces or who have received a medical-related discharge from the Armed Forces.
<br>
<br>"(2) Effective on the day before the date of the enactment of this Act, a veteran who served a minimum obligated time in service, but who did not meet the criteria described in paragraph (1), did not receive a means of identifying the veteran's status as a veteran other than using the Department of Defense form DD–214 discharge papers of the veteran.
<br>
<br>"(3) Goods, services, and promotional activities are often offered by public and private institutions to veterans who demonstrate proof of service in the military, but it is impractical for a veteran to always carry Department of Defense form DD–214 discharge papers to demonstrate such proof.
<br>
<br>"(4) A general purpose veteran identification card made available to veterans would be useful to demonstrate the status of the veterans without having to carry and use official Department of Defense form DD–214 discharge papers.
<br>
<br>"(5) On the day before the date of the enactment of this Act, the Department of Veterans Affairs had the infrastructure in place across the United States to produce photographic identification cards and accept a small payment to cover the cost of these cards."
