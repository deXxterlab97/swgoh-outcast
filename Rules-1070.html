<br>Statutory Notes and Related Subsidiaries
<br>Effective Date; Postponement in Certain Cases
<br>
<br>Act June 23, 1939, ch. 242, §§1, 2, 53 Stat. 853, 854, provided that:
<br>
<br>"[Sec. 1] (a) The effective date of the following provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is hereby postponed until January 1, 1940: Sections 402(c) [342(c) of this title]; 403(e)(1) [343(e)(1) of this title]; 403(g), (h), (i), (j), and (k) [343(g) to (k) of this title]; 501(a), (4) [351(a)(4) of this title]; 502(b), (d), (e), (f), (g), and (h) [352(b), (d) to (h) of this title]; 601(e) [361(e) of this title]; and 602(b) [362(b) of this title].
<br>
<br>"(b) The Secretary of Agriculture shall promulgate regulations further postponing to July 1, 1940[,] the effective date of the provisions of sections 403(e)(1) [343(e)(1) of this title]; 403(g), (h), (i), (j), and (k) [343(g) to (k)]; 502(b), (d), (e), (f), (g), and (h) [352(b), (d) to (h) of this title]; and 602(b) [362(b) of this title] of such Act with respect to lithographed labeling which was manufactured prior to February 1, 1939, and to containers bearing labeling which, prior to February 1, 1939, was lithographed, etched, stamped, pressed, printed, fused or blown on or in such containers, where compliance with such provisions would be unduly burdensome by reason of causing the loss of valuable stocks of such labeling or containers, and where such postponement would not prevent the public interest being adequately served: Provided, That in no case shall such regulations apply to labeling which would not have complied with the requirements of the Food and Drugs Act of June 30, 1906, as amended.
<br>
<br>"Sec. 2. (a) The provisions of section 8 [section 10 of this title], paragraph fifth, under the heading 'In the case of food:', of the Food and Drugs Act of June 30, 1906, as amended, and regulations promulgated thereunder, and all other provisions of such Act to the extent that they may relate to the enforcement of such section 8 [section 10 of this title] and of such regulations, shall remain in force until January 1, 1940.
<br>
<br>"(b) The provisions of such Act of June 30, 1906, as amended, [sections 1 to 5, 7 to 15, and 372a of this title] to the extent that they impose, or authorize the imposition of, any requirement imposed by section 403(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [section 343(k) of this title], shall remain in force until January 1, 1940.
<br>
<br>"(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 1 of this Act, such section shall not apply—
<br>
<br>"(1) to the provisions of section 502(d) and (e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [352(d), (e) of this title], insofar as such provisions relate to any substance named in section 8 [section 10 of this title], paragraph second, under the heading 'In the case of drugs:', of the Food and Drugs Act of June 30, 1906, as amended, or a derivative of any such substance; or
<br>
<br>"(2) to the provisions of section 502(b), (d), (e), (f), (g), and (h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [352(b), (d) to (h) of this title], insofar as such provisions relate to drugs to which section 505 [355 of this title] of such Act applies."
