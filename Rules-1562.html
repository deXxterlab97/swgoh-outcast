(1950), states that the Comptroller General will be able to prescribe appropriation and fund accounting systems under 31:49 "in terms of principles, standards and related requirements rather than in terms of detailed forms and procedures". The reference to the judicial branch covers authority that the Comptroller General was given under 31:49 that applies to departments and establishments except the Supreme Court that was not superseded by the source provisions restated in subsection (a) of this section.

<br>"SEC. 801. SHORT TITLE[.]
<br>
<br>"This title may be cited as the 'Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996.'
<br>"SEC. 802. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.
<br>
<br>"(a) Findings.—The Congress finds the following:
<br>
<br>"(1) Much effort has been devoted to strengthening Federal internal accounting controls in the past. Although progress has been made in recent years, Federal accounting standards have not been uniformly implemented in financial management systems for agencies.
<br>
<br>"(2) Federal financial management continues to be seriously deficient, and Federal financial management and fiscal practices have failed to—
<br>
<br>"(A) identify costs fully;
<br>
<br>"(B) reflect the total liabilities of congressional actions; and
<br>
<br>"(C) accurately report the financial condition of the Federal Government.
<br>
<br>"(3) Current Federal accounting practices do not accurately report financial results of the Federal Government or the full costs of programs and activities. The continued use of these practices undermines the Government's ability to provide credible and reliable financial data and encourages already widespread Government waste, and will not assist in achieving a balanced budget.
<br>
<br>"(4) Waste and inefficiency in the Federal Government undermine the confidence of the American people in the government and reduce the federal Government's ability to address vital public needs adequately.
<br>
<br>"(5) To rebuild the accountability and credibility of the Federal Government, and restore public confidence in the Federal Government, agencies must incorporate accounting standards and reporting objectives established for the Federal Government into their financial management systems so that all the assets and liabilities, revenues, and expenditures or expenses, and the full costs of programs and activities of the Federal Government can be consistently and accurately recorded, monitored, and uniformly reported throughout the Federal Government.
<br>
<br>"(6) Since its establishment in October 1990, the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (hereinafter referred to as the 'FASAB') has made substantial progress toward developing and recommending a comprehensive set of accounting concepts and standards for the Federal Government. When the accounting concepts and standards developed by FASAB are incorporated into Federal financial management systems, agencies will be able to provide cost and financial information that will assist the Congress and financial managers to evaluate the cost and performance of Federal programs and activities, and will therefore provide important information that has been lacking, but is needed for improved decision making by financial managers and the Congress.
<br>
<br>"(7) The development of financial management systems with the capacity to support these standards and concepts will, over the long term, improve Federal financial management.
<br>
<br>"(b) Purpose[.]—The purposes of this Act [title] are to—
<br>
<br>"(1) provide for consistency of accounting by an agency from one fiscal year to the next, and uniform accounting standards throughout the Federal Government;
<br>
<br>"(2) require Federal financial management systems to support full disclosure of Federal financial data, including the full costs of Federal programs and activities, to the citizens, the Congress, the President, and agency management, so that programs and activities can be considered based on their full costs and merits;
<br>
<br>"(3) increase the accountability and credibility of federal [sic] financial management;
<br>
<br>"(4) improve performance, productivity and efficiency of Federal Government financial management;
<br>
<br>"(5) establish financial management systems to support controlling the cost of Federal Government;
<br>
<br>"(6) build upon and complement the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (Public Law 101–576; 104 Stat 2838) [see Short Title of 1990 Amendment note set out under section 501 of this title], the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (Public Law 103–62[;] 107 Stat. 285) [see Short Title of 1993 Amendment note set out under section 1101 of this title] and the Government Management Reform Act of 1994 (Public Law 103–356; 108 Stat. 3410) [see Short Title of 1994 Amendment note set out under section 3301 of this title]; and
<br>
<br>"(7) increase the capability of agencies to monitor execution of the budget by more readily permitting reports that compare spending of resources to results of activities.

<br>Findings and Purposes
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 106–531, §2, Nov. 22, 2000, 114 Stat. 2537, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(a) Findings.—Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>"(1) existing law imposes numerous financial and performance management reporting requirements on agencies;
<br>
<br>"(2) these separate requirements can cause duplication of effort on the part of agencies and result in uncoordinated reports containing information in a form that is not completely useful to Congress; and
<br>
<br>"(3) pilot projects conducted by agencies under the direction of the Office of Management and Budget demonstrate that single consolidated reports providing an analysis of verifiable financial and performance management information produce more useful reports with greater efficiency.
<br>
<br>"(b) Purposes.—The purposes of this Act [see Short Title of 2000 Amendment note set out under section 3501 of this title] are—
<br>
<br>"(1) to authorize and encourage the consolidation of financial and performance management reports;
<br>
<br>"(2) to provide financial and performance management information in a more meaningful and useful format for Congress, the President, and the public;
<br>
<br>"(3) to improve the quality of agency financial and performance management information; and
<br>
<br>"(4) to enhance coordination and efficiency on the part of agencies in reporting financial and performance management information."
<br>Special Rule for Fiscal Years 2000 and 2001

<br>SUBCHAPTER III—AUDITING AND SETTLING ACCOUNTS
<br>§3521. Audits by agencies
<br>
<br>(a) Each account of an agency shall be audited administratively before being submitted to the Comptroller General. The head of each agency shall prescribe regulations for conducting the audit and designate a place at which the audit is to be conducted. However, a disbursing official of an executive agency may not administratively audit vouchers for which the official is responsible. With the consent of the Comptroller General, the head of the agency may waive any part of an audit.
<br>
<br>(b) The head of an agency may prescribe a statistical sampling procedure to audit vouchers of the agency when the head of the agency decides economies will result from using the procedure. The Comptroller General—
<br>
<br>(1) may prescribe the maximum amount of a voucher that may be audited under this subsection; and
<br>
<br>(2) in reviewing the accounting system of the agency, shall evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of the procedure.
<br>
<br>(c) A disbursing or certifying official acting in good faith under subsection (b) of this section is not liable for a payment or certification of a voucher not audited specifically because of the procedure prescribed under subsection (b) if the official and the head of the agency carry out diligently collection action the Comptroller General prescribes.
<br>
<br>(d) Subsections (b) and (c) of this section do not—
<br>
<br>(1) affect the liability, or authorize the relief, of a payee, beneficiary, or recipient of an illegal, improper, or incorrect payment; or
<br>
<br>(2) relieve a disbursing or certifying official, the head of an agency, or the Comptroller General of responsibility in carrying out collection action against a payee, beneficiary, or recipient.
<br>
<br>(e) Each financial statement prepared under section 3515 by an agency shall be audited in accordance with applicable generally accepted government auditing standards—
<br>
<br>(1) in the case of an agency having an Inspector General appointed under the Inspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App.), by the Inspector General or by an independent external auditor, as determined by the Inspector General of the agency; and
<br>
<br>(2) in any other case, by an independent external auditor, as determined by the head of the agency.
<br>
<br>(f) For each audited financial statement required under subsection (a) of section 3515 of this title, the person who audits the statement for purpose of subsection (e) of this section shall submit a report on the audit to the head of the agency and the Controller of the Office of Federal Financial Management. A report under this subsection shall be prepared in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
<br>
<br>(g) The Comptroller General of the United States—
<br>
<br>(1) may review any audit of a financial statement conducted under this subsection by an Inspector General or an external auditor;
<br>
<br>(2) shall report to the Congress, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and the head of the agency which prepared the statement, regarding the results of the review and make any recommendation the Comptroller General considers appropriate; and
<br>
<br>(3) may audit a financial statement prepared under section 3515 of this title at the discretion of the Comptroller General or at the request of a committee of the Congress.
<br>
<br>An audit the Comptroller General performs under this subsection shall be in lieu of the audit otherwise required by subsection (e) of this section. Prior to performing such audit, the Comptroller General shall consult with the Inspector General of the agency which prepared the statement.
<br>
<br>(h) Each financial statement prepared by an executive agency for a fiscal year after fiscal year 1991 shall be audited in accordance with this section and the plan required by section 3512(a)(3)(B)(viii) of this title.
<br>
<br>(i)(1) If the Government Accountability Office audits any financial statement or related schedule which is prepared under section 3515 by an executive agency (or component thereof) for a fiscal year beginning on or after October 1, 2009, such executive agency (or component) shall reimburse the Government Accountability Office for the cost of such audit, if the Government Accountability Office audited the statement or schedule of such executive agency (or component) for fiscal year 2007.
