<br>In the raiment of the slain, that are thrust through with the sword,
<br>That go down to the pavement of the pit,
<br>As a carcass trodden under foot.
<br>20Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial,
<br>Bbecause thou hast destroyed thy land,
<br>Thou hast slain thy people; The seed of evil-doers shall not
<br> 
<br>Be named for ever.
<br>21Prepare ye slaughter for his children
<br>For the iniquity of their fathers;
<br>That they rise not up, and possess the earth,
<br>And fill the face of the world with cities.
<br>22And I will rise up against them, saith the LORD of hosts, and cut off from Babylon name and remnant, and offshoot and offspring, saith the LORD. 23I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of water; and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, saith the LORD of hosts.
<br>
<br>24The LORD of hosts hath sworn, saying:
<br>Surely as I have thought, so shall it come to pass;
<br>And as I have purposed, so shall it stand,
<br>25That I will break Asshur in My land,
<br>And upon My mountains tread him under foot;
<br>Then shall his yoke depart from off them,
<br>And his burden depart from off their shoulder.
<br>26This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth;
<br>And this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations.
<br>27For the LORD of hosts hath purposed,
<br>And who shall disannul it? And His hand is stretched out,
<br> 
<br>And who shall turn it back?
<br>
<br>28In the year that king Ahaz died was this burden.
<br>
<br>29Rejoice not, O Philistia, all of thee,
<br>Because the rod that smote thee is broken:
<br>For out of the serpent’s root shall come forth a basilisk,
<br>And his fruit shall be a flying serpent.
<br>30And the first-born of the poor shall feed,
<br>And the needy shall lie down in safety;
<br>And I will kill thy root with famine, And thy remnant shall be slain 31Howl, O gate; cry, O city;
<br>Melt away, O Philistia, all of thee;
<br>For there cometh a smoke out of the north,
<br>And there is no straggler in his ranks.
<br>32What then shall one answer the messengers of the nation?
<br>That the LORD hath founded Zion,
<br>And in her shall the afflicted of His people take refuge.
<br>15 The burden of Moab.
<br>For in the night that Ar of Moab is
<br>laid waste,
<br>He is brought to ruin;
<br>For in the night that Kir of Moab is laid waste,
<br>He is brought to ruin.
<br> 
<br>2He is gone up to Baith, and to Dibon,
<br>Tto the high places, to weep; Upon Nebo, and upon Medeba,
<br>Moab howleth;
<br>On all their heads is baldness, Every beard is shaven.
<br>3In their streets they gird themselves with sackcloth;
<br>On their housetops, and in their broad places,
<br>Every one howleth, weeping profusely.
<br>4And Heshbon crieth out, and Elealeh;
<br>Their voice is heard even unto Jahaz;
<br>Therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud;
<br>His soul is faint within him. 5My heart crieth out for Moab; Her fugitives reach unto Zoar, A heifer of three years old; For by the ascent of Luhith With weeping they go up;
<br>For in the way of Horonaim
<br>They raise up a cry of destruction.
<br>6For the Waters of Nimrim shall be desolate;
<br>For the grass is withered away, the herbage faileth,
<br>There is no green thing.
<br>7Therefore the abundance they have gotten,
<br>And that which they have laid up,
<br>Shall they carry away to the brook of the willows.
<br>8For the cry is gone round about The borders of Moab;
<br> 
<br>The howling thereof unto Eglaim, And the howling thereof unto Beer-
<br>elim.
<br>9For the waters of Dimon are full of blood;
<br>For I will bring yet more upon Dimon,
<br>A lion upon him that escapeth of Moab,
<br>And upon the remnant of the land.
<br>
<br>Send ye the lambs for the ruler of the land
<br>From the crags that are toward the wilderness,
<br>Unto the mount of the daughter of Zion.
<br>2For it shall be that, as wandering birds,
<br>As a scattered nest,
<br>So shall the daughters of Moab be At the fords of Arnon.
<br>3’Give counsel, execute justice;
<br>Make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the noonday;
<br>Hide the outcasts; betray not the fugitive.
<br>4Let mine outcasts dwell with thee;
<br>As for Moab, be thou a covert to him from the face of the spoiler.’
<br>For the extortion is at an end, spoiling ceaseth,
<br>They that trampled down are consumed out of the land;
<br>5And a throne is established through mercy,
<br>And there sitteth thereon in truth, in the tent of David,
<br> 
<br>One that judgeth, and seeketh justice, and is ready in righteousness.
<br>
<br>6We have heard of the pride of Moab;
<br>He is very proud;
<br>Even of his haughtiness, and his pride, and his arrogancy,
<br>His ill-founded boastings.
<br>7Therefore shall Moab wail for Moab,
<br>Every one shall wail; for the sweet cakes of Kir-hareseth shall ye mourn,
<br>Sorely stricken.
<br>8For the fields of Heshbon languish, And the vine of Sibmah,
<br>Whose choice plants did overcome The lords of nations;
<br>They reached even unto Jazer, They wandered into the wilderness; Her branches were spread abroad, They passed over the sea.
<br>9Therefore I will weep with the weeping of Jazer
<br>For the vine of Sibmah;
<br>I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and Elealeh;
<br>For upon thy summer fruits and upon thy harvest
<br>The battle shout is fallen.
<br>10And gladness and joy are taken away
<br>Out of the fruitful field;
<br>And in the vineyards there shall be no singing,
<br>Neither shall there be shouting;
<br> 
<br>No treader shall tread out wine in the presses;
<br>I have made the vintage shout to cease.
<br>11Wherefore my heart moaneth like a harp for Moab,
<br>And mine inward parts for Kir- heres.
<br>12And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Moab hath wearied himself upon the high place, that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray; but he shall not prevail
<br>13This is the word that the LORD spoke concerning Moab in time past. 14But now the LORD hath spoken, saying: ‘Within three years, as the years of a hireling, and the glory of Moab shall wax contemptible for all his great multitude; and the remnant shall be very small and without strength.’
<br>17 The burden of Damascus.
<br>Behold, Damascus is taken away
<br>from being a city,
<br>And it shall be a ruinous heap. 2The cities of Aroer are forsaken; They shall be for flocks,
<br>Which shall lie down, and none shall make them afraid.
<br>3The fortress also shall cease from Ephraim,
<br>And the kingdom from Damascus; And the remnant of Aram shall be as the glory of the children of
<br>Israel,
<br>Sith the LORD of hosts.
<br> 
<br>
<br>4And it shall come to pass in that day,
<br>That the glory of Jacob shall be made thin,
<br>And the fatness of his flesh shall wax lean.
<br>5And it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the standing corn,
<br>And reapeth the ears with his arm;
<br>Yea, it shall be as when one gleaneth ears
<br>In the valley of Rephaim.
<br>6Yet there shall be left therein gleanings,
<br>As at the beating of an olive-tree, Two or three berries
<br>In the top of the uppermost bough,
<br>Four or five in the branches of the fruitful tree,
<br>Saith the LORD, the God of Israel.
<br>
<br>7In that day shall a man regard his Maker,
<br>And his eyes shall look to the Holy One of Israel.
<br>8And he shall not regard the altars, The work of his hands,
<br>Neither shall he look to that which his fingers have made,
<br>Either the Asherim, or the sun- images.
<br>
<br>9In that day shall his strong cities be as the forsaken places, which were forsaken from before the children of Israel, after the manner of woods and
<br> 
<br>lofty	forests;	and	it	shall	be	a desolation.
<br>10For thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation,
<br>And thou hast not been mindful of the Rock of thy stronghold;
<br>Therefore thou didst plant plants of pleasantness,
<br>And didst set it with slips of a stranger;
<br>11In the day of thy planting thou didst make it to grow,
<br>And in the morning thou didst make thy seed to blossom—
<br>A heap of boughs in the day of grief And of desperate pain.
<br>
<br>12Ah, the uproar of many peoples,
<br>That roar like the roaring of the seas;
<br>And the rushing of nations, that rush like the rushing of mighty waters!
<br>13The nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters;
<br>But He shall rebuke them, and they shall flee far off,
<br>And shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind,
<br>And like the whirling dust before the storm.
<br>14At eventide behold terror;
<br>And before the morning they are not.
<br>This is the portion of them that spoil us,
<br>And the lot of them that rob us.
<br>
<br>Ah, land of the buzzing of wings,
<br> 
<br>Which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia;
<br>2That sendeth ambassadors by the sea,
<br>Even in vessels of papyrus upon the waters!
<br>Go, ye swift messengers,
<br>To a nation tall and of glossy skin,
<br>To a people terrible from their beginning onward;
<br>A nation that is sturdy and treadeth down,
<br>Whose land the rivers divide!
<br>3All ye inhabitants of the world, and ye dwellers on the earth,
<br>When an ensign is lifted up on the mountains, see ye;
<br>And when the horn is blown, hear ye.
<br>
<br>4For thus hath the LORD said unto me:
<br>I will hold Me still, and I will look on in My dwelling-place,
<br>Like clear heat in sunshine,
<br>Like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.
<br>5For before the harvest, when the blossom is over,
<br>And the bud becometh a ripening grape,
<br>He will cut off the sprigs with pruning-hooks,
<br>And the shoots will He take away and lop off.
<br>6They shall be left together unto the ravenous birds of the mountains,
<br>And to the beasts of the earth;
<br> 
<br>And the ravenous birds shall summer upon them,
<br>And all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them.
<br>7In that time shall a present be brought unto the LORD of hosts of a people tall and of glossy skin, and from a people terrible from their beginning onward; a nation that is sturdy and treadeth down, whose land the rivers divide, to the place of the name of the LORD of hosts, the mount Zion.
<br>19 The burden of Egypt.
<br>Behold, the LORD rideth upon a swift
<br>cloud,
<br>And cometh unto Egypt;
<br>And the idols of Egypt shall be moved at His presence,
<br>And the heart of Egypt shall melt within it.
<br>2And I will spur Egypt against Egypt;
<br>And they shall fight every one against his brother,
<br>And everyone against his neighbour;
<br>City against city, and kingdom against kingdom.
<br>3And the spirit of Egypt shall be made empty within it;
<br>And I will make void the counsel thereof;
<br>And they shall seek unto the idols, and to the whisperers,
<br>And to the ghosts, and to the familiar spirits.
<br>4And I will give over the Egyptians
<br> 
<br>Iinto the hand of a cruel lord;
<br>And a fierce king shall rule over them,
<br>Saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts.
<br>
<br>5And the waters shall fail from the sea,
<br>And the river shall be drained dry, 6And the rivers shall become foul;
<br>The streams of Egypt shall be minished and dried up;
<br>The reeds and flags shall wither. 7The mosses by the Nile, by the
<br>brink of the Nile,
<br>And all that is sown by the Nile, Shall become dry, be driven away,
<br>and be no more.
<br>8The fishers also shall lament,
<br>And all they that cast angle into the Nile shall mourn,
<br>And they that spread nets upon the waters shall languish.
<br>9Moreover	they	that	work	in combed flax,
<br>And they that weave cotton, shall be ashamed.
<br>10And her foundations shall be crushed,
<br>All they that make dams shall be grieved in soul.
<br>
<br>11The princes of Zoan are utter fools;
<br>The wisest counsellors of Pharaoh are a senseless counsel;
<br>How can ye say unto Pharaoh: ‘I am the son of the wise,
<br>The son of ancient kings’?
<br> 
<br>12Where are they, then, thy wise men?
<br>And let them tell thee now;
<br>And let them know what the LORD of hosts
<br>Hath purposed concerning Egypt. 13The princes of Zoan are become
<br>fools,
<br>The princes of Noph are deceived;
<br>They have caused Egypt to go astray,
<br>That are the corner-stone of her tribes.
<br>14The LORD hath mingled within her
<br>A spirit of dizziness;
<br>And they have caused Egypt to stagger in every work thereof,
<br>As a drunken man staggereth in his vomit.
<br>15Neither shall there be for Egypt any work,
<br>Which head or tail, palm-branch or rush, may do.
<br>16In that day shall Egypt be like unto women; and it shall tremble and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the LORD of hosts, which He shaketh over it. 17And the land of Judah shall become a terror unto Egypt, whensoever one maketh mention thereof to it; it shall be afraid, because of the purpose of the LORD of hosts, which He purposeth against it.
<br>18In that day there shall be five cities in the land of Egypt that speak the language of Canaan, and swear to the LORD of hosts; one shall be called The city of destruction. 19In that day shall
<br> 
<br>there be an altar to the LORD in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to the LORD. 20And it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the LORD of hosts in the land of Egypt; for they shall cry unto the LORD because of the oppressors, and He will send them a saviour, and a defender, who will deliver them. 21And the LORD shall make Himself known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know the LORD in that day; yea, they shall worship with sacrifice and offering, and shall vow a vow unto the LORD, and shall perform it.
<br>22And the LORD will smite Egypt, smiting and healing; and they shall return unto the LORD, and He will be entreated of them, and will heal them. 23In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria; and the Egyptians shall worship with the Assyrians.
<br>24In that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the earth; 25for that the LORD of hosts hath blessed him, saying: ‘Blessed be Egypt My people and Assyria the work of My hands, and Israel Mine inheritance.’
<br>
<br>In the year that Tartan came into Ashdod, when Sargon the
<br>king of Assyria sent him, and he fought against Ashdod and took it; 2at that time the LORD spoke by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying: ‘Go, and loose
<br> 
<br>the sackcloth from off thy loins, and put thy shoe from off thy foot.’ And he did so, walking naked and barefoot.
<br>3And the LORD said: ‘Like as My servant Isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot to be for three years a sign and a wonder upon Egypt and upon Ethiopia, 4so shall the king of Assyria lead away the captives of Egypt, and the exiles of Ethiopia, young and old, naked and barefoot, and with buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt. 5And they shall be dismayed and ashamed, because of Ethiopia their expectation, and of Egypt their glory. 6And the inhabitant of this coast-land shall say in that day: Behold, such is our expectation, whither we fled for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria; and how shall we escape?’
<br>
<br>The burden of the wilderness of the sea.
<br>
<br>As whirlwinds in the South sweeping on,
<br>It cometh from the wilderness, from a dreadful land.
<br>2A grievous vision is declared unto me:
<br>‘The treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth.
<br>Go up, O Elam! besiege, O Media!
<br>All the sighing thereof have I made to cease.’
<br>3Therefore are my loins filled with convulsion;
<br> 
<br>Pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman in travail;
<br>I am bent so that I cannot hear;
<br>I am affrighted so that I cannot see.
<br>4My heart is bewildered, terror hath overwhelmed me;
<br>The twilight that I longed for hath been turned for me into trembling.
<br>5They prepare the table, they light the lamps, they eat, they drink—
<br>’Rise up, ye princes, anoint the shield.’
<br>
<br>6For thus hath the Lord said unto me:
<br>Go, set a watchman; let him declare what he seeth!
<br>7And when he seeth a troop, horsemen by pairs,
<br>A troop of asses, a troop of camels,
<br>He shall hearken diligently with much heed.
<br>8And he cried as a lion: ‘Upon the watch-tower, O Lord,
<br>I stand continually in the daytime,
<br>And I am set in my ward all the nights.’
<br>9And, behold, there came a troop of men, horsemen by pairs.
<br>And he spoke and said: ‘Fallen, fallen is Babylon;
<br>And all the graven images of her gods are broken unto the ground.’
<br>10O thou my threshing, and the winnowing of my floor,
<br>That which I have heard from the LORD of hosts,
<br> 
<br>The God of Israel, have I declared unto you.
<br>
<br>11The burden of Dumah.
<br>
<br>One calleth unto me out of Seir: ‘Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?’ 12The watchman said:
<br>‘The morning cometh, and also the night—
<br>If ye will inquire, inquire ye; return, come.’
<br>
<br>13The burden upon Arabia.
<br>
<br>In the thickets in Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye caravans of Dedanites.
<br>14Unto him that is thirsty bring ye water!
<br>The inhabitants of the land of Tema did meet the fugitive with his bread.
<br>15For they fled away from the swords, from the drawn sword,
<br>And from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.
<br>16For thus hath the Lord said unto me: ‘Within a year, according to the years of a hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall fail; 17and the residue of the number of the archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be diminished; for the LORD, the God of Israel, hath spoken it.’
<br>
<br>The burden concerning the Valley of Vision.
<br> 
<br>
<br>What aileth thee now, that thou art wholly gone up to the housetops,
<br>2Thou that art full of uproar, a tumultuous city, a joyous town?
<br>Thy slain are not slain with the sword, nor dead in battle.
<br>3All thy rulers are fled together, Without the bow they are bound;
<br>All that are found of thee are bound together, they are fled afar off.
<br>4Therefore said I: ‘Look away from me, I will weep bitterly;
<br>Strain not to comfort me, for the destruction of the daughter of my people.’
<br>5For it is a day of trouble, and of trampling, and of perplexity,
<br>From the Lord, the GOD of hosts, in the Valley of Vision;
<br>Kir shouting, and Shoa at the mount.
<br>6And Elam bore the quiver, with troops of men, even horsemen;
<br>And Kir uncovered the shield.
<br>7And it came to pass, when thy choicest valleys were full of chariots,
<br>And the horsemen set themselves in array at the gate,
<br>8And the covering of Judah was laid bare,
<br>that thou didst look in that day to the armour in the house of the forest. 9And ye saw the breaches of the city of David, that they were many; and ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool. 10And ye numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and ye broke down the houses to fortify the wall;
<br> 
<br>11ye made also a basin between the two walls for the water of the old pool—
<br>But ye looked not unto Him that had done this,
<br>Neither had ye respect unto Him that fashioned it long ago.
<br>12And in that day did the Lord, the GOD of hosts, call
<br>To weeping, and to lamentation, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth;
<br>13And behold joy and gladness, Slaying oxen and killing sheep, Eating flesh and drinking wine— ’Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow
<br>we shall die! ’
<br>14And the LORD of hosts revealed Himself in mine ears:
<br>Surely this iniquity shall not be expiated by you till ye die, Saith the Lord, the GOD of hosts.
<br>
<br>15Thus saith the Lord, the GOD of hosts:
<br>Go, get thee unto this steward,
<br>Even unto Shebna, who is over the house:
<br>16What hast thou here, and whom hast thou here,
<br>That thou hast hewed thee out here a sepulchre,
<br>Thou that hewest thee out a sepulchre on high,
<br>And gravest a habitation for thyself in the rock?
<br>17Behold, the LORD will hurl thee up and down with a man’s throw;
<br> 
<br>Yea, He will wind thee round and round;
<br>18He will violently roll and toss thee like a ball into a large country;
<br>There shalt thou die, and there shall be the chariots of thy glory,
<br>Thou shame of the lord’s house. 19And I will thrust thee from thy
<br>post,
<br>And from thy station shalt thou be pulled down.
<br>20And it shall come to pass in that day,
<br>That I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah;
<br>21And I will clothe him with thy robe,
<br>And bind him with thy girdle,
<br>And I will commit thy government into his hand;
<br>And he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah.
<br>22And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder;
<br>And he shall open, and none shall shut;
<br>And he shall shut, and none shall open.
<br>23And I will fasten him as a peg in a sure place;
<br>And he shall be for a throne of honour to his father’s house.
<br>24And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father’s house, the offspring and the issue, all vessels of small quantity, from the vessels of
<br> 
<br>cups even to all the vessels of flagons. 25In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall the peg that was fastened in a sure place give way; and it shall be hewn down, and fall, and the burden that was upon it shall be cut off; for the LORD hath spoken it.
<br>23 The burden of Tyre. Howl, ye ships of Tarshish,
<br>For it is laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in;
<br>From the land of Kittim it is revealed to them.
<br>2Be still, ye inhabitants of the coast- land;
<br>Thou whom the merchants of Zidon, that pass over the sea, have replenished.
<br>3And on great waters the seed of Shihor,
<br>The harvest of the Nile, was her revenue;
<br>And she was the mart of nations.
<br>4Be thou ashamed, O Zidon; for the sea hath spoken,
<br>The stronghold of the sea, saying: ‘I have not travailed, nor brought
<br>forth,
<br>Neither have I reared young men, nor brought up virgins.’
<br>5When the report cometh to Egypt,
<br>They shall be sorely pained at the report of Tyre.
<br>
<br>6Pass ye over to Tarshish; howl, ye inhabitants of the coast-land.
<br>7Is this your joyous city,
<br> 
<br>Whose feet in antiquity, In ancient days,
<br>Carried her afar off to sojourn?
<br>8Who hath devised this against Tyre, the crowning city,
<br>Whose merchants are princes,
<br>Whose traffickers are the honourable of the earth?
<br>9The LORD of hosts hath devised it, To pollute the pride of all glory,
<br>To bring into contempt all the honourable of the earth.
<br>10Overflow thy land as the Nile,
<br>O daughter of Tarshish! there is no girdle any more.
<br>11He hath stretched out His hand over the sea,
<br>He hath shaken the kingdoms;
<br>The LORD hath given commandment concerning Canaan,
<br>To destroy the strongholds thereof;
<br>12And He said: ‘Thou shalt no more rejoice.’
<br>O thou oppressed virgin daughter of Zidon,
<br>Arise, pass over to Kittim;
<br>Even there shalt thou have no rest.
<br>13Behold, the land of the Chaldeans—this is the people that was not, when Asshur founded it for shipmen—they set up their towers, they overthrew the palaces thereof; it is made a ruin.
<br>14Howl, ye ships of Tarshish,
<br>For your stronghold is laid waste.
<br>
<br>15And it shall come to pass in that day, that Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of
<br> 
<br>one king; after the end of seventy years it shall fare with Tyre as in the song of the harlot:
<br>16Take a harp,
<br>Go about the city,
<br>Thou harlot long forgotten; Make sweet melody,
<br>Sing many songs,
<br>That thou mayest be remembered.
<br>17And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years, that the LORD will remember Tyre, and she shall return to her hire, and shall have commerce with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth. 18And her gain and her hire shall be holiness to the LORD; it shall not be treasured nor laid up; for her gain shall be for them that dwell before the LORD, to eat their fill, and for stately clothing.
<br>
<br>Behold, the LORD maketh the earth empty and maketh it waste,
<br>And turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof.
<br>2And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest;
<br>As with the servant, so with his master;
<br>As with the maid, so with her mistress;
<br>As with the buyer, so with the seller;
<br>As with the lender, so with the borrower;
<br>As with the creditor, so with the debtor.
<br> 
<br>3The earth shall be utterly emptied, and clean despoiled;
<br>For the LORD hath spoken this word. 4The earth fainteth and fadeth away, The world faileth and fadeth away, The lofty people of the earth do fail. 5The earth also is defiled under the
<br>inhabitants thereof;
<br>Because they have transgressed the laws, violated the statute,
<br>Broken the everlasting covenant.
<br>6Therefore hath a curse devoured the earth,
<br>And they that dwell therein are found guilty;
<br>Therefore the inhabitants of the earth waste away,
<br>And men are left few.
<br>7The new wine faileth, the vine fadeth;
<br>All the merry-hearted do sigh.
<br>8The mirth of tabrets ceaseth,
<br>The noise of them that rejoice endeth,
<br>The joy of the harp ceaseth.
<br>9They drink not wine with a song;
<br>Strong drink is bitter to them that drink it.
<br>10Broken down is the city of wasteness;
<br>Every house is shut up, that none may come in.
<br>11There is a crying in the streets amidst the wine;
<br>All joy is darkened,
<br>The mirth of the land is gone. 12In the city is left desolation, And the gate is smitten unto ruin.
<br> 
<br>13For thus shall it be in the midst of the earth, among the peoples,
<br>As at the beating of an olive-tree,
<br>As at the gleanings when the vintage is done.
<br>14Those yonder lift up their voice, they sing for joy;
<br>For the majesty of the LORD they shout from the sea:
<br>15’Therefore glorify ye the LORD in the regions of light,
<br>Even the name of the LORD, the God of Israel, in the isles of the sea.’
<br>
<br>16From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs: ‘Glory to the righteous.’
<br>But I say: I waste away, I waste away, woe is me!
<br>The treacherous deal treacherously;
<br>Yea, the treacherous deal very treacherously.
<br>17Terror, and the pit, and the trap, are upon thee, O inhabitant of the earth.
<br>18And it shall come to pass, that he who fleeth from the noise of the terror shall fall into the pit;
<br>And he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the trap;
<br>For the windows on high are opened,
<br>And the foundations of the earth do shake;
<br>19The earth is broken, broken down, The earth is crumbled in pieces, The earth trembleth and tottereth;
<br> 
<br>20The earth reeleth to and fro like a drunken man,
<br>And swayeth to and fro as a lodge;
<br>And the transgression thereof is heavy upon it,
<br>And it shall fall, and not rise again.
<br>21And it shall come to pass in that day,
<br>That the LORD will punish the host of the high heaven on high,
<br>And the kings of the earth upon the earth.
<br>22And they shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the dungeon,
<br>And shall be shut up in the prison,
<br>And after many days shall they be punished.
<br>23Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed;
<br>For the LORD of hosts will reign in mount Zion,
<br>And in Jerusalem, and before His elders shall be Glory.
<br>
<br>O LORD, Thou art my God,
<br>I will exalt Thee, I will praise Thy name,
<br>For Thou hast done wonderful things;
<br>Even counsels of old, in faithfulness and truth.
<br>2For Thou hast made of a city a heap,
<br>Of a fortified city a ruin;
<br>A castle of strangers to be no city, It shall never be built.
<br> 
<br>3Therefore shall the strong people glorify Thee,
<br>The city of the terrible nations shall fear Thee.
<br>4For Thou hast been a stronghold to the poor,
<br>A stronghold to the needy in his distress,
<br>A refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat;
<br>For the blast of the terrible ones was as a storm against the wall.
<br>5As the heat in a dry place, Thou didst subdue the noise of strangers;
<br>As the heat by the shadow of a cloud, the song of the terrible ones was brought low.
<br>
<br>6And in this mountain will the LORD of hosts make unto all peoples
<br>A feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees,
<br>Of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.
<br>7And He will destroy in this mountain
<br>The face of the covering that is cast over all peoples,
<br>And the veil that is spread over all nations.
<br>8He will swallow up death for ever;
<br>And the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces;
<br>And the reproach of His people will He take away from off all the earth;
<br>For the LORD hath spoken it.
<br> 
<br>9And it shall be said in that day: ‘Lo, this is our God,
<br>For whom we waited, that He might save us;
<br>This is the LORD, for whom we waited,
<br>We will be glad and rejoice in His salvation.’
<br>10For in this mountain will the hand of the LORD rest,
<br>And Moab shall be trodden down in his place,
<br>Even as straw is trodden down in the dunghill.
<br>11And when he shall spread forth his hands in the midst thereof,
<br>As he that swimmeth spreadeth forth his hands to swim,
<br>His pride shall be brought down together with the cunning of his hands.
<br>12And the high fortress of thy walls will He bring down, lay low,
<br>And bring to the ground, even to the dust.
<br>
<br>In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah:
<br>We have a strong city;
<br>Walls and bulwarks doth He appoint for salvation.
<br>2Open ye the gates,
<br>That the righteous nation that keepeth faithfulness may enter in.
<br>3The mind stayed on Thee Thou keepest in perfect peace;
<br>Because it trusteth in Thee.
<br>4Trust ye in the LORD for ever,
<br> 
<br>For the LORD is GOD, an everlasting Rock.
<br>5For He hath brought down them that dwell on high,
<br>The lofty city, laying it low, laying it low even to the ground,
<br>Bringing it even to the dust.
<br>6The foot shall tread it down,
<br>Even the feet of the poor, and the steps of the needy.
<br>
<br>7The way of the just is straight;
<br>Thou, Most Upright, makest plain the path of the just.
<br>8Yea, in the way of Thy judgments, O LORD, have we waited for Thee;
<br>To Thy name and to Thy memorial is the desire of our soul.
<br>9With my soul have I desired Thee in the night;
<br>Yea, with my spirit within me have I sought Thee earnestly;
<br>For when Thy judgments are in the earth,
<br>The inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.
<br>10Let favour be shown to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteousness;
<br>In the land of uprightness will he deal wrongfully,
<br>And will not behold the majesty of the LORD.
<br>
<br>11LORD, Thy hand was lifted up, yet they see not;
<br>They shall see with shame Thy zeal for the people;
<br> 
<br>Yea, fire shall devour Thine adversaries.
<br>12LORD, Thou wilt establish peace for us;
<br>For Thou hast indeed wrought all our works for us.
<br>13O LORD our God, other lords beside Thee have had dominion over us;
<br>But by Thee only do we make mention of Thy name.
<br>14The dead live not, the shades rise not;
<br>To that end hast Thou punished and destroyed them,
<br>And made all their memory to perish.
<br>15Thou hast gotten Thee honour with the nations, O LORD,
<br>Yea, exceeding great honour with the nations;
<br>Thou art honoured unto the farthest ends of the earth.
<br>
<br>16LORD, in trouble have they sought Thee,
<br>Silently they poured out a prayer when Thy chastening was upon them.
<br>17Like as a woman with child, that draweth near the time of her delivery,
<br>Is in pain and crieth out in her pangs;
<br>So have we been at Thy presence, O LORD.
<br>18We have been with child, we have been in pain,
<br> 
<br>We have as it were brought forth wind;
<br>We have not wrought any deliverance in the land;
<br>Neither are the inhabitants of the world come to life.
<br>19Thy dead shall live, my dead bodies shall arise—
<br>Awake and sing, ye that dwell in the dust—
<br>For Thy dew is as the dew of light,
<br>And the earth shall bring to life the shades.
<br>
<br>20Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers,
<br>And shut thy doors about thee; Hide thyself for a little moment, Until the indignation be overpast.
<br>21For, behold, the LORD cometh forth out of His place
<br>To visit upon the inhabitants of the earth their iniquity;
<br>The earth also shall disclose her blood,
<br>And shall no more cover her slain.
<br>In that day the LORD with His sore and great and strong
<br>sword will punish leviathan the slant serpent, and leviathan the tortuous serpent; and He will slay the dragon that is in the sea.
<br>2In that day sing ye of her:
<br>‘A vineyard of foaming wine! ’
<br>3I the LORD do guard it,
<br>I water it every moment; Lest Mine anger visit it, I guard it night and day. 4Fury is not in Me;
<br> 
<br>Would that I were as the briers and thorns in flame!
<br>I would with one step burn it altogether.
<br>5Or else let him take hold of My strength,
<br>That he may make peace with Me; yea, let him make peace with Me.
<br>6In days to come shall Jacob take root,
<br>Israel shall blossom and bud;
<br>And the face of the world shall be filled with fruitage.
<br>
<br>7Hath He smitten him as He smote those that smote him?
<br>Or is he slain according to the slaughter of them that were slain by Him?
<br>8In full measure, when Thou sendest her away, Thou dost contend with her;
<br>He hath removed her with His rough blast in the day of the east wind.
<br>9Therefore by this shall the iniquity of Jacob be expiated,
<br>And this is all the fruit of taking away his sin:
<br>When he maketh all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in pieces,
<br>So that the Asherim and the sun- images shall rise no more.
<br>10For the fortified city is solitary,
<br>A habitation abandoned and forsaken, like the wilderness;
<br>There shall the calf feed, and there shall he lie down,
<br>And consume the branches thereof
<br> 
<br>11When the boughs thereof are withered,
<br>They shall be broken off;
<br>The women shall come, and set them on fire;
<br>For it is a people of no understanding;
<br>Therefore He that made them will not have compassion upon them,
<br>And He that formed them will not be gracious unto them.
<br>
<br>12And it shall come to pass in that day,
<br>That the LORD will beat off [His fruit]
<br>From the flood of the River unto the Brook of Egypt,
<br>And ye shall be gathered one by one, O ye children of Israel.
<br>
<br>13And it shall come to pass in that day,
<br>That a great horn shall be blown;
<br>And they shall come that were lost in the land of Assyria,
<br>And they that were dispersed in the land of Egypt;
<br>And they shall worship the LORD in the holy mountain at Jerusalem.
<br>
<br>Woe to the crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim,
<br>And to the fading flower of his glorious beauty,
<br>Which is on the head of the fat valley of them that are smitten down with wine!
<br> 
<br>2Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one,
<br>As a storm of hail, a tempest of destruction,
<br>As a storm of mighty waters overflowing,
<br>That casteth down to the earth with violence.
<br>3The crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim
<br>Shall be trodden under foot;
<br>4And the fading flower of his glorious beauty,
<br>Which is on the head of the fat valley,
<br>Shall be as the first-ripe fig before the summer,
<br>Which when one looketh upon it,
<br>While it is yet in his hand he eateth it up.
<br>
<br>5In that day shall the LORD of hosts be
<br>For a crown of glory, and for a diadem of beauty,
<br>Unto the residue of His people;
<br>6And for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment,
<br>And for strength to them that turn back the battle at the gate.
<br>
<br>7But these also reel through wine, And stagger through strong drink;
<br>The priest and the prophet reel through strong drink,
<br>They are confused because of wine,
<br>They stagger because of strong drink;
<br> 
<br>They reel in vision, they totter in judgment.
<br>8For all tables are full of filthy vomit, and no place is clean.
<br>
<br>9Whom shall one teach knowledge?
<br>And whom shall one make to understand the message?
<br>Them that are weaned from the milk,
<br>Them that are drawn from the breasts?
<br>10For it is precept by precept, precept by precept,
<br>Line by line, line by line; Here a little, there a little.
<br>11For with stammering lips and with a strange tongue
<br>Shall it be spoken to this people;
<br>12To whom it was said: ‘This is the rest,
<br>Give ye rest to the weary; And this is the refreshing’; Yet they would not hear.
<br>13And so the word of the LORD is unto them
<br>Precept by precept, precept by precept,
<br>Line by line, line by line; Here a little, there a little;
<br>That they may go, and fall backward, and be broken,
<br>And snared, and taken.
<br>
<br>14Wherefore hear the word of the LORD, ye scoffers,
<br>The ballad-mongers of this people which is in Jerusalem:
<br> 
<br>15Because ye have said: ‘We have made a covenant with death,
<br>And with the nether-world are we at agreement;
<br>When the scouring scourge shall pass through,
<br>It shall not come unto us;
<br>For we have made lies our refuge,
<br>And in falsehood have we hid ourselves’;
<br>16Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD:
<br>Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone,
<br>A tried stone, a costly corner-stone of sure foundation;
<br>He that believeth shall not make haste.
<br>17And I will make justice the line, And righteousness the plummet;
<br>And the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies,
<br>And the waters shall overflow the hiding-place.
<br>18And your covenant with death shall be disannulled
<br>And your agreement with the nether-world shall not stand;
<br>When the scouring scourge shall pass through,
<br>Then ye shall be trodden down by it,
<br>19As often as it passeth through, it shall take you;
<br>For morning by morning shall it pass through,
<br>By day and by night;
<br>And it shall be sheer terror to understand the message.
<br>20For the bed is too short for a man to stretch himself;
<br> 
<br>And the covering too narrow when he gathereth himself up.
<br>21For the LORD will rise up as in mount Perazim,
<br>He will be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon;
<br>That He may do His work, strange is His work,
<br>And bring to pass His act, strange is His act.
<br>22Now therefore be ye not scoffers, Lest your bands be made strong;
<br>For an extermination wholly determined have I heard from the Lord, the GOD of hosts,
<br>Upon the whole land.
<br>
<br>23Give ye ear, and hear my voice; attend, and hear my speech.
<br>24Is the plowman never done with plowing to sow,
<br>With the opening and harrowing of his ground?
<br>25When he hath made plain the face thereof,
<br>Doth he not cast abroad the black cummin, and scatter the cummin,
<br>And put in the wheat in rows and the barley in the appointed place
<br>And the spelt in the border thereof? 26For He doth instruct him aright; His God doth teach him.
<br>27For the black cummin is not threshed with a threshing-sledge,
<br>Neither is a cart-wheel turned about upon the cummin;
<br>But the black cummin is beaten out with a staff,
<br>And the cummin with a rod.
<br> 
<br>28Is bread corn crushed?
<br>Nay, he will not ever be threshing it;
<br>And though the roller of his wagon and its sharp edges move noisily,
<br>He doth not crush it.
<br>29This also cometh forth from the LORD of hosts:
<br>Wonderful is His counsel, and great His wisdom.
<br>
<br>Ah, aAriel, Ariel, the city where David encamped!
<br>Add ye year to year,
<br>Let the feasts come round!
<br>2Then will I distress Ariel,
<br>And there shall be mourning and moaning; and she shall be unto Me as a hearth of God.
<br>3And I will encamp against thee round about,
<br>And will lay siege against thee with a mound,
<br>And I will raise siege works against thee.
<br>4And brought down thou shalt speak out of the ground,
<br>And thy speech shall be low out of the dust;
<br>And thy voice shall be as of a ghost out of the ground,
<br>And thy speech shall chirp out of the dust.
<br>5But the multitude of thy foes shall be like small dust,
<br>And the multitude of the terrible ones as chaff that passeth away;
<br>
<br>
<br>a That is, The hearth of God.
<br> 
<br>Yea, it shall be at an instant suddenly—
<br>6There shall be a visitation from the LORD of hosts
<br>With thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise,
<br>With whirlwind and tempest, and the flame of a devouring fire.
<br>7And the multitude of all the nations that war against Ariel,
<br>Even all that war against her, and the bulwarks about her, and they that distress her,
<br>Shall be as a dream, a vision of the night.
<br>8And it shall be as when a hungry man dreameth, and, behold, he eateth,
<br>But he awaketh, and his soul is empty;
<br>Or as when a thirsty man dreameth, and, behold, he drinketh,
<br>But he awaketh, and, behold, he is faint, and his soul hath appetite—
<br>So shall the multitude of all the nations be, that fight against mount Zion.
<br>
<br>9Stupefy yourselves, and be stupid! Blind yourselves, and be blind!
<br>Ye that are drunken, but not with wine,
<br>That stagger, but not with strong drink.
<br>10For the LORD hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep,
<br>And hath closed your eyes;
<br> 
<br>The prophets, and your heads, the seers, hath He covered.
<br>11And the vision of all this is become unto you as the words of a writing that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying: ‘Read this, I pray thee’; and he saith: ‘I cannot, for it is sealed’; 12and the writing is delivered to him that is not learned, saying: ‘Read this, I pray thee’; and he saith: ‘I am not learned.’
<br>
<br>13And the Lord said: Forasmuch as this people draw near,
<br>And with their mouth and with their lips do honour Me,
<br>But have removed their heart far from Me,
<br>And their fear of Me is a command-ment of men learned by rote;
<br>14Therefore, behold, I will again do a marvellous work among this people,
<br>Even a marvellous work and a wonder;
<br>And the wisdom of their wise men shall perish,
<br>And the prudence of their prudent men shall be hid.
<br>
<br>15Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the LORD,
<br>And their works are in the dark,
<br>And they say: ‘Who seeth us? and who knoweth us?’
<br>16O your perversity!
<br> 
<br>Shall the potter be esteemed as clay;
<br>That the thing made should say of him that made it: ‘He made me not’;
<br>Or the thing framed say of him that framed it: ‘He hath no understanding?’
<br>17Is it not yet a very little while,
<br>And Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field,
<br>And the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest?
<br>18And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of a book,
<br>And the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness.
<br>19The humble also shall increase their joy in the LORD,
<br>And the neediest among men shall exult in the Holy One of Israel.
<br>20For the terrible one is brought to nought,
<br>And the scorner ceaseth,
<br>And all they that watch for iniquity are cut off;
<br>21That make a man an offender by words,
<br>And lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate,
<br>And turn aside the just with a thing of nought.
<br>22Therefore thus saith the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob:
<br>Jacob shall not now be ashamed,
<br>Neither shall his face now wax pale;
<br> 
<br>23When he seeth his children, the work of My hands, in the midst of him,
<br>That they sanctify My name;
<br>Yea, they shall  sanctify the Holy One of Jacob,
<br>And shall stand in awe of the God of Israel.
<br>24They also that err in spirit shall come to understanding,
<br>And they that murmur shall learn instruction.
<br>
<br>Woe to the rebellious children, saith the LORD,
<br>That take counsel, but not of Me; And that form projects, but not of
<br>My spirit,
<br>That they may add sin to sin; 2That walk to go down into Egypt, And have not asked at My mouth;
<br>To take refuge in the stronghold of Pharaoh,
<br>And to take shelter in the shadow of Egypt!
<br>3Therefore shall the stronghold of Pharaoh turn to your shame,
<br>And the shelter in the shadow of Egypt to your confusion.
<br>4For his princes are at Zoan,
<br>And his ambassadors are come to Hanes.
<br>5They shall all be ashamed of a people that cannot profit them,
<br>That are not a help nor profit, But a shame, and also a reproach.
<br>
<br>6The burden of the beasts of the South.
<br> 
<br>
<br>Through the land of trouble and anguish,
<br>From whence come the lioness and the lion,
<br>The viper and flying serpent,
<br>They carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses,
<br>And their treasures upon the humps of camels,
<br>To a people that shall not profit them.
<br>7For Egypt helpeth in vain, and to no purpose;
<br>Therefore	have	I	called	her arrogancy that sitteth still.
<br>8Now go, write it before them on a tablet,
<br>And inscribe it in a book,
<br>That it may be for the time to come For ever and ever.
<br>9For it is a rebellious people, Lying children,
<br>Children that refuse to hear the teaching of the LORD;
<br>10That say to the seers: ‘See not’,
<br>And to the prophets: ‘Prophesy not unto us right things,
<br>Speak unto us smooth things, prophesy delusions;
<br>11Get you out of the way, Turn aside out of the path, Cause the Holy One of Israel To cease from before us.’
<br>12Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel:
<br>Because ye despise this word,
<br>And	trust	in	oppression	and perverseness,
<br> 
<br>And stay thereon;
<br>13Therefore this iniquity shall be to you
<br>As a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall,
<br>Whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instant.
<br>14And He shall break it as a potter’s vessel is broken,
<br>Breaking it in pieces without sparing;
<br>So that there shall not be found among the pieces thereof a sherd
<br>To take fire from the hearth,
<br>Or to take water out of the cistern.
<br>
<br>15For thus said the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel:
<br>In sitting still and rest shall ye be saved,
<br>In quietness and in confidence shall be your strength;
<br>And ye would not.
<br>16But ye said: ‘No, for we will flee upon horses’;
<br>Therefore shall ye flee;
<br>And: ‘We will ride upon the swift’;
<br>Therefore shall they that pursue you be swift.
<br>17One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one,
<br>At the rebuke of five shall ye flee;
<br>Till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain,
<br>And as an ensign on a hill.
<br>18And therefore will the LORD wait, that He may be gracious unto you,
<br> 
<br>And therefore will He be exalted, that He may have compassion upon you;
<br>For the LORD is a God of justice, Happy are all they that wait for
<br>Him.
<br>
<br>19For, O people that dwellest in Zion at Jerusalem,
<br>Thou shalt weep no more;
<br>He will surely be gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry,
<br>When He shall hear, He will answer thee.
<br>20And though the Lord give you sparing bread and scant water,
<br>Yet shall not thy Teacher hide Himself any more,
<br>But	thine	eyes	shall	see	thy Teacher;
<br>21And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying:
<br>‘This is the way, walk ye in it,
<br>When ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.’
<br>22And ye shall defile thy graven images overlaid with silver,
<br>And thy molten images covered with gold;
<br>Thou shalt put them far away as one unclean;
<br>Thou shalt say unto it: ‘Get thee hence.’
<br>23And He will give the rain for thy seed, wherewith thou sowest the ground,
<br>And bread of the increase of the ground, and it shall be fat and plenteous;
<br> 
<br>In that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures.
<br>24The oxen likewise and the young asses that till the ground
<br>Shall eat savoury provender,
<br>Wwhich hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan.
<br>25And there shall be upon every lofty mountain, and upon every high hill
<br>Streams and watercourses,
<br>In the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.
<br>26Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun,
<br>And the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of the seven days,
<br>In the day that the LORD bindeth up the bruise of His people,
<br>And healeth the stroke of their wound.
<br>
<br>27Behold, the name of the LORD cometh from far,
<br>With His anger burning, and in thick uplifting of smoke;
<br>His lips are full of indignation,
<br>And His tongue is as a devouring fire;
<br>28And	His	breath	is	as	an overflowing stream,
<br>That divideth even unto the neck,
<br>To sift the nations with the sieve of destruction;
<br>And a bridle that causeth to err shall be in the jaws of the peoples.
<br>29Ye shall have a song
<br> 
<br>As in the night when a feast is hallowed;
<br>And gladness of heart, as when one goeth with the pipe
<br>To come into the mountain of the LORD, to the Rock of Israel.
<br>30And the LORD    will cause His glorious voice to be heard,
<br>And will show the lighting down of His arm,
<br>With furious anger, and the flame of a devouring fire,
<br>With a bursting of clouds, and a storm of rain, and hailstones.
<br>31For through the voice of the LORD shall Asshur be dismayed,
<br>The rod with which He smote.
<br>32And in every place where the appointed staff shall pass,
<br>Which the LORD shall lay upon him, It shall be with tabrets and harps;
<br>And in battles of wielding will He fight with them.
<br>33For a hearth is ordered of old; Yea, for the king it is prepared, Deep and large;
<br>The pile thereof is fire and much wood;
<br>The breath of the LORD, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it.
<br>
<br>Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help,
<br>And rely on horses,
<br>And trust in chariots, because they are many,
<br>And in horsemen, because they are exceeding mighty;
<br> 
<br>But they look not unto the Holy One of Israel,
<br>Neither seek the LORD! 2Yet He also is wise, And bringeth evil,
<br>And doth not call back His words;
<br>But will arise against the house of the evil-doers,
<br>And against the help of them that work iniquity.
<br>3Now the Egyptians are men, and not God,
<br>And their horses flesh, and not spirit;
<br>So when the LORD shall stretch out His hand,
<br>Both he that helpeth shall stumble, and he that is helped shall fall, And they all shall perish together.
<br>
<br>4For thus saith the LORD unto me: Like as the lion, or the young lion,
<br>growling over his prey,
<br>Though a multitude of shepherds be called forth against him,
<br>Will not be dismayed at their voice,
<br>Nor abase himself for the noise of them;
<br>So will the LORD of hosts come down
<br>To fight upon mount Zion, and upon the hill thereof.
<br>5As birds hovering,
<br>So will the LORD of hosts protect Jerusalem;
<br>He will deliver it as He protecteth it, He will rescue it as He passeth over. 6Turn ye unto Him
<br> 
<br>Against whom ye have deeply rebelled, O children of Israel.
<br>7For in that day they shall cast away every man his idols of silver, and his idols of gold,
<br>Which your own hands have made unto you for a sin.
<br>8Then shall Asshur fall with the sword, not of man,
<br>And the sword, not of men, shall devour him;
<br>And he shall flee from the sword,
