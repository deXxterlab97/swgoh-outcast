<br>(g) Definitions
<br>
<br>In this section:
<br>(1) Interoperable communications
<br>
<br>The term "interoperable communications" means the ability of emergency response providers and relevant Federal, State, and local government agencies to communicate with each other as necessary, through a dedicated public safety network utilizing information technology systems and radio communications systems, and to exchange voice, data, and video with one another on demand, in real time, as necessary.
<br>(2) Emergency response providers
<br>
<br>The term "emergency response providers" has the meaning that term has under section 101 of this title.
<br>(h) Omitted
<br>(i) Sense of Congress regarding interoperable communications
<br>(1) Finding
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(A) many first responders working in the same jurisdiction or in different jurisdictions cannot effectively and efficiently communicate with one another; and
<br>
<br>(B) their inability to do so threatens the public's safety and may result in unnecessary loss of lives and property.
<br>(2) Sense of Congress
<br>
<br>It is the sense of Congress that interoperable emergency communications systems and radios should continue to be deployed as soon as practicable for use by the first responder community, and that upgraded and new digital communications systems and new digital radios must meet prevailing national, voluntary consensus standards for interoperability.
