<br>§5001. Findings; purposes
<br>(a) Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds as follows:
<br>
<br>(1) In the Expedited Funds Availability Act [12 U.S.C. 4001 et seq.], enacted on August 10, 1987, the Congress directed the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to consider establishing regulations requiring Federal reserve banks and depository institutions to provide for check truncation, in order to improve the check processing system.
<br>
<br>(2) In that same Act, the Congress—
<br>
<br>(A) provided the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System with full authority to regulate all aspects of the payment system, including the receipt, payment, collection, and clearing of checks, and related functions of the payment system pertaining to checks; and
<br>
<br>(B) directed that the exercise of such authority by the Board superseded any State law, including the Uniform Commercial Code, as in effect in any State.
<br>
<br>(3) Check truncation is no less desirable in 2003 for both financial service customers and the financial services industry, to reduce costs, improve efficiency in check collections, and expedite funds availability for customers than it was over 15 years ago when Congress first directed the Board to consider establishing such a process.
<br>(b) Purposes
<br>
<br>The purposes of this chapter are as follows:
<br>
<br>(1) To facilitate check truncation by authorizing substitute checks.
<br>
<br>(2) To foster innovation in the check collection system without mandating receipt of checks in electronic form.
<br>
<br>(3) To improve the overall efficiency of the Nation's payments system.

<br>(1) Amount in event of breach of warranty

<br>(2) Rule of construction
<br>
<br>Nothing in this subsection reduces the rights of a consumer or any other person under the Uniform Commercial Code or other applicable provision of Federal or State law.

<br>If the indemnifying bank produces the original check or a copy of the original check (including an image or a substitute check) that accurately represents all of the information on the front and back of the original check (as of the time the original check was truncated) or is otherwise sufficient to determine whether or not a claim is valid, the indemnifying bank shall—
<br>
<br>(A) be liable under this section only for losses covered by the indemnity that are incurred up to the time that the original check or copy is provided to the indemnified party; and
<br>
<br>(B) have a right to the return of any funds it has paid under the indemnity in excess of those losses.
<br>(2) Coordination of indemnity with implied warranty
<br>
<br>The production of the original check, a substitute check, or a copy under paragraph (1) by an indemnifying bank shall not absolve the bank from any liability on a warranty established under this chapter or any other provision of law.
<br>(e) Subrogation of rights
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Each indemnifying bank shall be subrogated to the rights of any indemnified party to the extent of the indemnity.

<br>(a) Recredit claims
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>A consumer may make a claim for expedited recredit from the bank that holds the account of the consumer with respect to a substitute check, if the consumer asserts in good faith that—

<br>(A) the bank charged the consumer's account for a substitute check that was provided to the consumer;
<br>
<br>(B) either—
<br>
<br>(i) the check was not properly charged to the consumer's account; or
<br>
<br>(ii) the consumer has a warranty claim with respect to such substitute check;
<br>
<br>(C) the consumer suffered a resulting loss; and

<br>(2) 40-day period
<br>
<br>Any claim under paragraph (1) with respect to a consumer account may be submitted by a consumer before the end of the 40-day period beginning on the later of—

<br>
<br>(B) the date on which the substitute check is made available to the consumer.
<br>(3) Extension under extenuating circumstances
<br>
<br>If the ability of the consumer to submit the claim within the 40-day period under paragraph (2) is delayed due to extenuating circumstances, including extended travel or the illness of the consumer, the 40-day period shall be extended by a reasonable amount of time.
<br>(b) Procedures for claims
<br>(1) In general
<br>

<br>
<br>(i) why the substitute check was not properly charged to the consumer's account; or
<br>
<br>(ii) the warranty claim with respect to such check;
<br>
<br>(B) a statement that the consumer suffered a loss and an estimate of the amount of the loss;
<br>
<br>(C) the reason why production of the original check or a better copy of the original check is necessary to determine the validity of the charge to the consumer's account or the warranty claim; and
<br>
<br>(D) sufficient information to identify the substitute check and to investigate the claim.
<br>(2) Claim in writing
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The bank holding the consumer account that is the subject of a claim by the consumer under subsection (a) may, in the discretion of the bank, require the consumer to submit the information required under paragraph (1) in writing.
<br>(B) Means of submission
<br>
<br>A bank that requires a submission of information under subparagraph (A) may permit the consumer to make the submission electronically, if the consumer has agreed to communicate with the bank in that manner.
<br>(c) Recredit to consumer
<br>(1) Conditions for recredit
<br>
<br>The bank shall recredit a consumer account in accordance with paragraph (2) for the amount of a substitute check that was charged against the consumer account if—
<br>
<br>(A) a consumer submits a claim to the bank with respect to that substitute check that meets the requirement of subsection (b); and
<br>
<br>(B) the bank has not—
<br>
<br>(i) provided to the consumer—
<br>
<br>(I) the original check; or
<br>
<br>(II) a copy of the original check (including an image or a substitute check) that accurately represents all of the information on the front and back of the original check, as of the time at which the original check was truncated; and
<br>
<br>(ii) demonstrated to the consumer that the substitute check was properly charged to the consumer account.
<br>(2) Timing of recredit
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The bank shall recredit the consumer's account for the amount described in paragraph (1) no later than the end of the business day following the business day on which the bank determines the consumer's claim is valid.
<br>(B) Recredit pending investigation
<br>
<br>If the bank has not yet determined that the consumer's claim is valid before the end of the 10th business day after the business day on which the consumer submitted the claim, the bank shall recredit the consumer's account for—
<br>
<br>(i) the lesser of the amount of the substitute check that was charged against the consumer account, or $2,500, together with interest if the account is an interest-bearing account, no later than the end of such 10th business day; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the remaining amount of the substitute check that was charged against the consumer account, if any, together with interest if the account is an interest-bearing account, not later than the 45th calendar day following the business day on which the consumer submits the claim.
<br>(d) Availability of recredit
<br>(1) Next business day availability
<br>
<br>Except as provided in paragraph (2), a bank that provides a recredit to a consumer account under subsection (c) shall make the recredited funds available for withdrawal by the consumer by the start of the next business day after the business day on which the bank recredits the consumer's account under subsection (c).
<br>(2) Safeguard exceptions
<br>
<br>A bank may delay availability to a consumer of a recredit provided under subsection (c)(2)(B)(i) until the start of either the business day following the business day on which the bank determines that the consumer's claim is valid or the 45th calendar day following the business day on which the consumer submits a claim for such recredit in accordance with subsection (b), whichever is earlier, in any of the following circumstances:
<br>(A) New accounts
<br>
<br>The claim is made during the 30-day period beginning on the business day the consumer account was established.
<br>(B) Repeated overdrafts
<br>
<br>Without regard to the charge that is the subject of the claim for which the recredit was made—
<br>
<br>(i) on 6 or more business days during the 6-month period ending on the date on which the consumer submits the claim, the balance in the consumer account was negative or would have become negative if checks or other charges to the account had been paid; or
<br>
<br>(ii) on 2 or more business days during such 6-month period, the balance in the consumer account was negative or would have become negative in the amount of $5,000 or more if checks or other charges to the account had been paid.
<br>(C) Prevention of fraud losses
<br>
<br>The bank has reasonable cause to believe that the claim is fraudulent, based on facts (other than the fact that the check in question or the consumer is of a particular class) that would cause a well-grounded belief in the mind of a reasonable person that the claim is fraudulent.
<br>(3) Overdraft fees
<br>
<br>No bank that, in accordance with paragraph (2), delays the availability of a recredit under subsection (c) to any consumer account may impose any overdraft fees with respect to drafts drawn by the consumer on such recredited amount before the end of the 5-day period beginning on the date notice of the delay in the availability of such amount is sent by the bank to the consumer.
<br>(e) Reversal of recredit
<br>
<br>A bank may reverse a recredit to a consumer account if the bank—
<br>
<br>(1) determines that a substitute check for which the bank recredited a consumer account under subsection (c) was in fact properly charged to the consumer account; and
<br>
<br>(2) notifies the consumer in accordance with subsection (f)(3).
<br>(f) Notice to consumer
<br>(1) Notice if consumer claim not valid
<br>
<br>If a bank determines that a substitute check subject to the consumer's claim was in fact properly charged to the consumer's account, the bank shall send to the consumer, no later than the business day following the business day on which the bank makes a determination—
<br>
<br>(A) the original check or a copy of the original check (including an image or a substitute check) that—
<br>
<br>(i) accurately represents all of the information on the front and back of the original check (as of the time the original check was truncated); or
<br>
<br>(ii) is otherwise sufficient to determine whether or not the consumer's claim is valid; and
<br>
<br>(B) an explanation of the basis for the determination by the bank that the substitute check was properly charged, including a statement that the consumer may request copies of any information or documents on which the bank relied in making the determination.
<br>(2) Notice of recredit
<br>
<br>If a bank recredits a consumer account under subsection (c), the bank shall send to the consumer, no later than the business day following the business day on which the bank makes the recredit, a notice of—
<br>
<br>(A) the amount of the recredit; and
<br>
<br>(B) the date the recredited funds will be available for withdrawal.
<br>(3) Notice of reversal of recredit
<br>
<br>In addition to the notice required under paragraph (1), if a bank reverses a recredited amount under subsection (e), the bank shall send to the consumer, no later than the business day following the business day on which the bank reverses the recredit, a notice of—
<br>
<br>(A) the amount of the reversal; and
<br>
<br>(B) the date the recredit was reversed.
<br>(4) Mode of delivery
<br>
<br>A notice described in this subsection shall be delivered by United States mail or by any other means through which the consumer has agreed to receive account information.
<br>(g) Other claims not affected
<br>
<br>Providing a recredit in accordance with this section shall not absolve the bank from liability for a claim made under any other law, such as a claim for wrongful dishonor under the Uniform Commercial Code, or from liability for additional damages under section 5005 or 5009 of this title.
<br>(h) Clarification concerning consumer possession
<br>
<br>A consumer who was provided a substitute check may make a claim for an expedited recredit under this section with regard to a transaction involving the substitute check whether or not the consumer is in possession of the substitute check.
<br>(i) Scope of application
<br>
<br>This section shall only apply to customers who are consumers.

<br>(a) Recredit claims
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>A bank may make a claim against an indemnifying bank for expedited recredit for which that bank is indemnified if—
<br>
<br>(A) the claimant bank (or a bank that the claimant bank has indemnified) has received a claim for expedited recredit from a consumer under section 5006 of this title with respect to a substitute check or would have been subject to such a claim had the consumer's account been charged;
<br>
<br>(B) the claimant bank has suffered a resulting loss or is obligated to recredit a consumer account under section 5006 of this title with respect to such substitute check; and
<br>
<br>(C) production of the original check, another substitute check, or a better copy of the original check is necessary to determine the validity of the charge to the customer account or any warranty claim connected with such substitute check.
<br>(2) 120-day period
<br>
<br>Any claim under paragraph (1) may be submitted by the claimant bank to an indemnifying bank before the end of the 120-day period beginning on the date of the transaction that gave rise to the claim.
<br>(b) Procedures for claims
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>To make a claim under subsection (a) for an expedited recredit relating to a substitute check, the claimant bank shall send to the indemnifying bank—
<br>
<br>(A) a description of—
<br>
<br>(i) the claim, including an explanation of why the substitute check cannot be properly charged to the consumer account; or
<br>
<br>(ii) the warranty claim;
<br>
<br>(B) a statement that the claimant bank has suffered a loss or is obligated to recredit the consumer's account under section 5006 of this title, together with an estimate of the amount of the loss or recredit;
<br>
<br>(C) the reason why production of the original check, another substitute check, or a better copy of the original check is necessary to determine the validity of the charge to the consumer account or the warranty claim; and
<br>
<br>(D) information sufficient for the indemnifying bank to identify the substitute check and to investigate the claim.
<br>(2) Requirements relating to copies of substitute checks
<br>
<br>If the information submitted by a claimant bank pursuant to paragraph (1) in connection with a claim for an expedited recredit includes a copy of any substitute check for which any such claim is made, the claimant bank shall take reasonable steps to ensure that any such copy cannot be—
<br>
<br>(A) mistaken for the legal equivalent of the check under section 5003(b) of this title; or
<br>
<br>(B) sent or handled by any bank, including the indemnifying bank, as a forward collection or returned check.
<br>(3) Claim in writing
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>An indemnifying bank may, in the discretion of the bank, require the claimant bank to submit the information required by paragraph (1) in writing, including a copy of the written or electronically submitted claim, if any, that the consumer provided in accordance with section 5006(b) of this title.
<br>(B) Means of submission
<br>
<br>An indemnifying bank that requires a submission of information under subparagraph (A) may permit the claimant bank to make the submission electronically, if the claimant bank has agreed to communicate with the indemnifying bank in that manner.
<br>(c) Recredit by indemnifying bank
<br>(1) Prompt action required
<br>
<br>No later than 10 business days after the business day on which an indemnifying bank receives a claim under subsection (a) from a claimant bank with respect to a substitute check, the indemnifying bank shall—
<br>
<br>(A) provide, to the claimant bank, the original check (with respect to such substitute check) or a copy of the original check (including an image or a substitute check) that—
<br>
<br>(i) accurately represents all of the information on the front and back of the original check (as of the time the original check was truncated); or
<br>
<br>(ii) is otherwise sufficient to determine the bank's claim is not valid; and
<br>
<br>(B) recredit the claimant bank for the amount of the claim up to the amount of the substitute check, plus interest if applicable; or
<br>
<br>(C) provide information to the claimant bank as to why the indemnifying bank is not obligated to comply with subparagraph (A) or (B).
<br>(2) Recredit does not abrogate other liabilities
<br>
<br>Providing a recredit under this subsection to a claimant bank with respect to a substitute check shall not absolve the indemnifying bank from liability for claims brought under any other law or from additional damages under section 5005 or 5009 of this title with respect to such check.
<br>(3) Refund to indemnifying bank
<br>
<br>If a claimant bank reverses, in accordance with section 5006(e) of this title, a recredit previously made to a consumer account under section 5006(c) of this title, or otherwise receives a credit or recredit with regard to such substitute check, the claimant bank shall promptly refund to any indemnifying bank any amount previously advanced by the indemnifying bank in connection with such substitute check.
<br>(d) Production of original check or a sufficient copy governed by section 5005(d)
<br>
<br>If the indemnifying bank provides the claimant bank with the original check or a copy of the original check (including an image or a substitute check) under subsection (c)(1)(A), section 5005(d) of this title shall govern any right of the indemnifying bank to any repayment of any funds the indemnifying bank has recredited to the claimant bank pursuant to subsection (c).

<br>§5018. Depositary services efficiency and cost reduction
<br>(a) Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds as follows:
<br>
<br>(1) The Secretary of the Treasury has long compensated financial institutions for various critical depositary and financial agency services provided for or on behalf of the United States by—
<br>
<br>(A) placing large balances, commonly referred to as "compensating balances", on deposit at such institutions; and
<br>
<br>(B) using imputed interest on such funds to offset charges for the various depositary and financial agency services provided to or on behalf of the Government.
<br>
<br>(2) As a result of sharp declines in interest rates over the last few years to record low levels, or the public debt outstanding reaching the statutory debt limit, the Department of the Treasury often has had to dramatically increase or decrease the size of the compensating balances on deposit at these financial institutions.
<br>
<br>(3) The fluctuation of the compensating balances, and the necessary pledging of collateral by financial institutions to secure the value of compensating balances placed with those institutions, have created unintended financial uncertainty for the Secretary of the Treasury and for the management by financial institutions of their cash and securities.
<br>
<br>(4) It is imperative that the process for providing financial services to the Government be transparent, and provide the information necessary for the Congress to effectively exercise its appropriation and oversight responsibilities.
<br>
<br>(5) The use of direct payment for services rendered would strengthen cash and debt management responsibilities of the Secretary of the Treasury because the Secretary would no longer need to dramatically increase or decrease the level of such balances when interest rates fluctuate sharply or when the public debt outstanding reaches the statutory debt limit.
<br>
<br>(6) An alternative to the use of compensating balances, such as direct payments to financial institutions, would ensure that payments to financial institutions for the services they provide would be made in a more predictable manner and could result in cost savings.
<br>
<br>(7) Limiting the use of compensating balances could result in a more direct and cost-efficient method of obtaining those services currently provided under compensating balance arrangements.
<br>
<br>(8) A transition from the use of compensating balances to another compensation method must be carefully managed to prevent higher-than-necessary transitional costs and enable participating financial institutions to modify their planned investment of cash and securities.
<br>(b) Authorization of appropriations for services rendered by depositaries and financial agencies of the United States
<br>
<br>There are authorized to be appropriated for fiscal years beginning after fiscal year 2003 to the Secretary of the Treasury such sums as may be necessary for reimbursing financial institutions in their capacity as depositaries and financial agents of the United States for all services required or directed by the Secretary of the Treasury, or a designee of the Secretary, to be performed by such financial institutions on behalf of the Secretary of the Treasury or another Federal agency, including services rendered before fiscal year 2004.
<br>(c) Orderly transition
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>As appropriations authorized in subsection (b) become available, the Secretary of the Treasury shall promptly begin the process of phasing in the use of the appropriations to pay financial institutions serving as depositaries and financial agents of the United States, and transitioning from the use of compensating balances to fund these services.
<br>(2) Post-transition use limited to extraordinary circumstances
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Following the transition to the use of the appropriations authorized in subsection (b), the Secretary of the Treasury may use the compensating balances to pay financial institutions serving as depositaries and financial agents of the United States only in extraordinary situations where the Secretary determines that they are needed to ensure the fiscal operations of the Government continue to function in an efficient and effective manner.
<br>(B) Report
<br>
<br>Any use of compensating balances pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall promptly be reported by the Secretary of the Treasury to the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate.
<br>(3) Requirements for orderly transition
<br>
<br>In transitioning to the use of the appropriations authorized in subsection (b), the Secretary of the Treasury shall take such steps as may be appropriate to—
<br>
<br>(A) prevent abrupt financial disruption to the functions of the Department of the Treasury or to the participating financial institutions; and
<br>
<br>(B) maintain adequate accounting and management controls to ensure that payments to financial institutions for their banking services provided to the Government as depositaries and financial agents are accurate and that the arrangements last no longer than is necessary.
<br>(4) Reports required
<br>(A) Annual report
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>For each fiscal year, the Secretary of the Treasury shall submit a report to the Congress on the use of compensating balances and on the use of appropriations authorized in subsection (b) during that fiscal year.
<br>(ii) Inclusion in budget
<br>
<br>The report required under clause (i) may be submitted as part of the budget submitted by the President under section 1105 of title 31 for the following fiscal year and if so, the report shall be submitted concurrently to the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate.
<br>(B) Final report following transition
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>Following completion of the transition from the use of compensating balances to the use of the appropriations authorized in subsection (b) to pay financial institutions for their services as depositaries and financial agents of the United States, the Secretary of the Treasury shall submit a report on the transition to the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate.
<br>(ii) Contents of report
<br>
<br>The report submitted under clause (i) shall include a detailed analysis of—
<br>
<br>(I) the cost of transition;
<br>
<br>(II) the direct costs of the services being paid from the appropriations authorized in subsection (b); and
<br>
<br>(III) the benefits realized from the use of direct payment for such services, rather than the use of compensating balance arrangements.
<br>(d) Omitted
<br>(e) Effective date
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding section 20,1 this section shall take effect on October 28, 2003.

<br>
<br>In order to increase uniformity, reduce regulatory burden, enhance consumer protection, and reduce fraud, the States, through the Conference of State Bank Supervisors and the American Association of Residential Mortgage Regulators, are hereby encouraged to establish a Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry for the residential mortgage industry that accomplishes all of the following objectives:
<br>
<br>(1) Provides uniform license applications and reporting requirements for State-licensed loan originators.
<br>
<br>(2) Provides a comprehensive licensing and supervisory database.
<br>
<br>(3) Aggregates and improves the flow of information to and between regulators.
<br>
<br>(4) Provides increased accountability and tracking of loan originators.
<br>
<br>(5) Streamlines the licensing process and reduces the regulatory burden.
<br>
<br>(6) Enhances consumer protections and supports anti-fraud measures.
<br>
<br>(7) Provides consumers with easily accessible information, offered at no charge, utilizing electronic media, including the Internet, regarding the employment history of, and publicly adjudicated disciplinary and enforcement actions against, loan originators.
<br>
<br>(8) Establishes a means by which residential mortgage loan originators would, to the greatest extent possible, be required to act in the best interests of the consumer.
<br>
<br>(9) Facilitates responsible behavior in the subprime mortgage market place and provides comprehensive training and examination requirements related to subprime mortgage lending.
<br>
<br>(10) Facilitates the collection and disbursement of consumer complaints on behalf of State and Federal mortgage regulators.
