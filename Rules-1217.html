If any person shall willfully and corruptly commit perjury, or by any means procure any person to commit perjury in any such oath, affirmation, affidavit, or deposition, within the intent and meaning of any Act of Congress now or hereafter made, such offender may be charged, proceeded against, tried, convicted, and dealt with in any district of the United States, in the same manner, in all respects, as if such offense had been committed in the United States, before any officer duly authorized therein to administer or take such oath, affirmation, affidavit, or deposition, and shall be subject to the same punishment and disability therefor as are or shall be prescribed by any such act for such offense; and any document purporting to have affixed, impressed, or subscribed thereto, or thereon the seal and signature of the officer administering or taking the same in testimony thereof, shall be admitted in evidence without proof of any such seal or signature being genuine or of the official character of such person; and if any person shall forge any such seal or signature, or shall tender in evidence any such document with a false or counterfeit seal or signature thereto, knowing the same to be false or counterfeit, he shall be deemed and taken to be guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction shall be imprisoned not exceeding three years nor less than one year, and fined, in a sum not to exceed $3,000, and may be charged, proceeded against, tried, convicted, and dealt with therefor in the district where he may be arrested or in custody.

<br>The Secretary of State shall prepare and submit to the Congress, annually, a report concerning diplomatic immunity entitled "Report on Cases Involving Diplomatic Immunity".
<br>(2) Content of report
<br>
<br>In addition to such other information as the Secretary of State may consider appropriate, the report under paragraph (1) shall include the following:
<br>
<br>(A) The number of persons residing in the United States who enjoy full immunity from the criminal jurisdiction of the United States under laws extending diplomatic privileges and immunities.
<br>
<br>(B) Each case involving an alien described in subparagraph (A) in which an appropriate authority of a State, a political subdivision of a State, or the United States reported to the Department of State that the authority had reasonable cause to believe the alien committed a serious criminal offense within the United States, and any additional information provided to the Secretary relating to other serious criminal offenses that any such authority had reasonable cause to believe the alien committed before the period covered by the report. The Secretary may omit from such report any matter the provision of which the Secretary reasonably believes would compromise a criminal investigation or prosecution or which would directly compromise law enforcement or intelligence sources or methods.
<br>
<br>(C) Each case described in subparagraph (B) in which the Secretary of State has certified that a person enjoys full immunity from the criminal jurisdiction of the United States under laws extending diplomatic privileges and immunities.
<br>
<br>(D) The number of United States citizens who are residing in a receiving state and who enjoy full immunity from the criminal jurisdiction of such state under laws extending diplomatic privileges and immunities.

<br>
<br>(ii) reckless driving; or
<br>
<br>(iii) driving while intoxicated.
<br>(b) United States policy concerning reform of diplomatic immunity
<br>
<br>It is the sense of the Congress that the Secretary of State should explore, in appropriate fora, whether states should enter into agreements and adopt legislation—
<br>
<br>(1) to provide jurisdiction in the sending state to prosecute crimes committed in the receiving state by persons entitled to immunity from criminal jurisdiction under laws extending diplomatic privileges and immunities; and
<br>
<br>(2) to provide that where there is probable cause to believe that an individual who is entitled to immunity from the criminal jurisdiction of the receiving state under laws extending diplomatic privileges and immunities committed a serious crime, the sending state will waive such immunity or the sending state will prosecute such individual.
<br>(c) Notification of diplomatic corps
<br>
<br>The Secretary should periodically notify each foreign mission of United States policies relating to criminal offenses committed by individuals with immunity from the criminal jurisdiction of the United States under laws extending diplomatic privileges and immunities.

<br>If a foreign mission has ceased conducting diplomatic, consular, and other governmental activities in the United States and has not designated a protecting power or other agent approved by the Secretary to be responsible for the property of that foreign mission, the Secretary—
<br>
<br>(1) until the designation of a protecting power or other agent approved by the Secretary, may protect and preserve any property of that foreign mission; and
<br>
<br>(2) may dispose of such property at such time as the Secretary may determine after the expiration of the one-year period beginning on the date that the foreign mission ceased those activities, and may remit to the sending State the net proceeds from such disposition.
<br>(d) Protection from future hostile intelligence activities in United States
<br>
<br>(1) After December 22, 1987, real property in the United States may not be acquired (by sale, lease, or other means) by or on behalf of the foreign mission of a foreign country described in paragraph (4) if, in the judgment of the Secretary of Defense (after consultation with the Secretary of State), the acquisition of that property might substantially improve the capability of that country to intercept communications involving United States Government diplomatic, military, or intelligence matters.
<br>
<br>(2) After December 22, 1987, real property in the United States may not be acquired (by sale, lease, or other means) by or on behalf of the foreign mission of a foreign country described in paragraph (4) if, in the judgment of the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (after consultation with the Secretary of State), the acquisition of that property might substantially improve the capability of that country to engage in intelligence activities directed against the United States Government, other than the intelligence activities described in paragraph (1).
<br>
<br>(3) The Secretary of State shall inform the Secretary of Defense and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation immediately upon notice being given pursuant to subsection (a) of this section of a proposed acquisition of real property by or on behalf of the foreign mission of a foreign country described in paragraph (4).
<br>
<br>(4) For the purposes of this subsection, the term "foreign country" means—
<br>
<br>(A) any country listed as a Communist country in section 2370(f) of this title;
<br>
<br>(B) any country determined by the Secretary of State, for purposes of section 4605(j) 1 of title 50, to be a country which has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism; and
<br>
<br>(C) any other country which engages in intelligence activities in the United States which are adverse to the national security interests of the United States.
<br>
<br>(5) As used in this section, the term "substantially improve" shall not be construed to prevent the establishment of a foreign mission by a country which, on December 22, 1987—
<br>
<br>(A) does not have a mission in the United States, or
<br>
<br>(B) with respect to a city in the United States, did not maintain a mission in that city.

<br>(b) Requirement of extraordinary circumstances
<br>

<br>Editorial Notes
<br>Amendments
<br>
<br>2006—Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 109–177, §605(e)(2)(C), substituted "subsections (a)(7) and (d) of section 3056A of title 18" for "sections 202(7) and 208 of title 3".
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 109–177, §605(d)(3), which directed amendment of section 214(a) of the State Department Basic Authorities Act by substituting "section 3056A(a)(7) and (d) of title 18" for "sections 202(8) and 208 of title 3", was not executed because this section, which is section 214 of the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956, did not contain the words "sections 202(8) and 208 of title 3" and because of the amendment by Pub. L. 109–177, §605(e)(2)(C). See note above.
<br>
<br>1994—Subsec. (c). Pub. L. 103–236 struck out subsec. (c) which read as follows: "Funds may be obligated under this section only after regulations to implement this section have been issued by the Secretary after consultation with appropriate committees of the Congress."
