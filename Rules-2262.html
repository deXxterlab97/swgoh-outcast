<br>
<br>(b) Loan Qualifications.—A loan may be insured under this section if—
<br>
<br>(1) the loan is made by a private lender approved by the Secretary as financially sound and able to service the loan properly;

<br>(5) the repayment period of the loan does not exceed the lesser of 40 years or the expected life of the asset financed;
<br>
<br>(6) the amount insured with respect to the loan does not exceed 90 percent of the loss sustained by the lender with respect to the loan; and
<br>
<br>(7) the loan, the borrower, and the historic property to be preserved meet such other terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Secretary by regulation, especially terms and conditions relating to the nature and quality of the preservation work.
<br>
<br>(c) Consultation.—The Secretary shall consult with the Secretary of the Treasury regarding the interest rate of loans insured under this section.
<br>
<br>(d) Limitation on Amount of Unpaid Principal Balance of Loans.—The aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans insured under this section may not exceed the amount that has been deposited in the Historic Preservation Fund but which has not been appropriated for any purpose.
<br>
<br>(e) Insurance Contracts.—Any contract of insurance executed by the Secretary under this section may be assignable, shall be an obligation supported by the full faith and credit of the United States, and shall be incontestable except for fraud or misrepresentation of which the holder had actual knowledge at the time it became a holder.
<br>
<br>(f) Conditions and Methods of Payment as Result of Loss.—The Secretary shall specify, by regulation and in each contract entered into under this section, the conditions and method of payment to a private lender as a result of losses incurred by the lender on any loan insured under this section.
<br>
