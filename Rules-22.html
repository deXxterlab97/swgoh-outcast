<br>Upon clothes taken in pledge,
<br>And in the house of their God they drink
<br>The wine of them that have been fined.
<br>9Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them,
<br>Whose height was like the height of the cedars,
<br>And he was strong as the oaks;
<br>Yet I destroyed his fruit from above, And his roots from beneath.
<br>10Also I brought you up out of the land of Egypt,
<br>And led you forty years in the wilderness,
<br>To possess the land of the Amorites.
<br>11And I raised up of your sons for prophets,
<br>And of your young men for Nazirites.
<br>Is it not even thus, O ye children of Israel?
<br>Saith the LORD.
<br>12But ye gave the Nazirites wine to drink;
<br>And commanded the prophets, saying: ‘Prophesy not.’
<br>13Behold, I will make it creak under you,
<br>As a cart creaketh that is full of sheaves.
<br>14And flight shall fail the swift,
<br>And the strong shall not exert his strength,
<br>Neither shall the mighty deliver himself;
<br> 
<br>15Neither shall he stand that handleth the bow;
<br>And he that is swift of foot shall not deliver himself;
<br>Neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself;
<br>16And he that is courageous among the mighty
<br>Shall flee away naked in that day, Saith the LORD.
<br>
<br>Hear this word that the LORD hath spoken against you, O children of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up out of the land of Egypt,
<br>saying:
<br>2You only have I known of all the families of the earth;
<br>Therefore I will visit upon you all your iniquities.
<br>
<br>3Will two walk together, Except they have agreed? 4Will a lion roar in the forest, When he hath no prey?
<br>Will a young lion give forth his voice out of his den,
<br>If he have taken nothing?
<br>5Will a bird fall in a snare upon the earth,
<br>Where there is no lure for it?
<br>Will a snare spring up from the ground,
<br>And have taken nothing at all? 6Shall the horn be blown in a city, And the people not tremble?
<br>Shall evil befall a city,
<br>And the LORD hath not done it?
<br>7For the Lord GOD will do nothing,
<br> 
<br>But He revealeth His counsel unto His servants the prophets.
<br>8The lion hath roared, Who will not fear?
<br>The Lord GOD hath spoken, Who can but prophesy?
<br>
<br>9Proclaim it upon the palaces at Ashdod,
<br>And upon the palaces in the land of Egypt,
<br>And say: ‘Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria,
<br>And behold the great confusions therein,
<br>And the oppressions in the midst thereof.’
<br>10For they know not to do right, saith the LORD,
<br>Who store up violence and robbery in their palaces.
<br>11Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD:
<br>An adversary, even round about the land!
<br>And he shall bring down thy strength from thee,
<br>And thy palaces shall be spoiled.
<br>12Thus saith the LORD:
<br>As the shepherd rescueth out of the mouth of the lion
<br>Two legs, or a piece of an ear,
<br>So shall the children of Israel that dwell in Samaria
<br>Escape with the corner of a couch, and the leg of a bed.
<br>
<br>13Hear ye, and testify against the house of Jacob,
<br> 
<br>Saith the Lord GOD, the God of hosts.
<br>14For in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon him,
<br>I will also punish the altars of Beth- el,
<br>And the horns of the altar shall be cut off,
<br>And fall to the ground.
<br>15And I will smite the winter-house with the summer-house;
<br>And the houses of ivory shall perish,
<br>And the great houses shall have an end,
<br>Saith the LORD.
<br>
<br>Hear   this	word,	ye	kine	of Bashan, That are in the mountain
<br>of Samaria,
<br>That oppress the poor, that crush the needy,
<br>That say unto their lords: ‘Bring, that we may feast.’
<br>2The Lord GOD hath sworn by His holiness:
<br>Lo, surely the days shall come upon you,
<br>That ye shall be taken away with hooks,
<br>And your residue with fish-hooks.
<br>3And ye shall go out at the breaches, every one straight before her;
<br>And ye shall be cast into Harmon, Saith the LORD.
<br>
<br>4Come to Beth-el, and transgress,
<br>To Gilgal, and multiply transgression;
<br> 
<br>And bring your sacrifices in the morning,
<br>And your tithes after three days;
<br>5And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving of that which is leavened,
<br>And proclaim freewill-offerings and publish them;
<br>For so ye love to do, O ye children of Israel,
<br>Saith the Lord GOD.
<br>
<br>6And I also have given you Cleanness of teeth in all your cities,
<br>And want of bread in all your places;
<br>Yet have ye not returned unto Me, Saith the LORD.
<br>
<br>7And I also have withholden the rain from you,
<br>When there were yet three months to the harvest;
<br>And I caused it to rain upon one city,
<br>And caused it not to rain upon another city;
<br>One piece was rained upon,
<br>And the piece whereupon it rained not withered.
<br>8So two or three cities wandered unto one city
<br>To drink water, and were not satisfied;
<br>Yet have ye not returned unto Me, Saith the LORD.
<br>
<br>9I have smitten you with blasting and mildew;
<br> 
<br>The multitude of your gardens and your vineyards
<br>And your fig-trees and your olive- trees
<br>Hath the palmer-worm devoured; Yet have ye not returned unto Me, Saith the LORD.
<br>
<br>10I have sent among you the pestilence in the way of Egypt;
<br>Your young men have I slain with the sword,
<br>And have carried away your horses; And I have made the stench of your camp to come up even into your
<br>nostrils;
<br>Yet have ye not returned unto Me, Saith the LORD.
<br>
<br>11I have overthrown some of you, As God overthrew Sodom and
<br>Gomorrah,
<br>And ye were as a brand plucked out of the burning;
<br>Yet have ye not returned unto Me, Saith the LORD.
<br>
<br>12Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel;
<br>Because I will do this unto thee, Prepare to meet thy God, O Israel. 13For, lo, He that formeth the
<br>mountains, and createth the wind,
<br>And declareth unto man what is his thought,
<br>That maketh the morning darkness,
<br>And treadeth upon the high places of the earth;
<br> 
<br>The LORD, the God of hosts, is His name.
<br>
<br>Hear ye this word which I take up for a lamentation over you, O
<br>house of Israel:
<br>2The virgin of Israel is fallen, She shall no more rise;
<br>She is cast down upon her land, There is none to raise her up.
<br>3For thus saith the Lord GOD: The city that went forth a thousand shall have a hundred left, and that which went forth a hundred shall have ten left, of the house of Israel.
<br>
<br>4For thus saith the LORD unto the house of Israel:
<br>Seek ye Me, and live; 5But seek not Beth-el, Nor enter into Gilgal,
<br>And pass not to Beer-sheba;
<br>For Gilgal shall surely go into captivity,
<br>And Beth-el shall come to nought.
<br>6Seek the LORD, and live—
<br>Lest He break out like fire in the house of Joseph,
<br>And it devour, and there be none to quench it in Bethel—
<br>7Ye who turn judgment to wormwood,
<br>And cast righteousness to the ground;
<br>8Him that maketh the Pleiades and Orion,
<br>And bringeth on the shadow of death in the morning,
<br>And darkeneth the day into night;
<br> 
<br>That calleth for the waters of the sea,
<br>And poureth them out upon the face of the earth;
<br>The LORD is His name;
<br>9That causeth destruction to flash upon the strong,
<br>So that destruction cometh upon the fortress.
<br>
<br>10They hate him that reproveth in the gate,
<br>And they abhor him that speaketh uprightly.
<br>11Therefore, because ye trample upon the poor,
<br>And take from him exactions of wheat;
<br>Ye have built houses of hewn stone, But ye shall not dwell in them,
<br>Ye have planted pleasant vineyards, But ye shall not drink wine thereof. 12For I know how manifold are your
<br>transgressions,
<br>And how mighty are your sins;
<br>Ye that afflict the just, that take a ransom,
<br>And that turn aside the needy in the gate.
<br>13Therefore the prudent doth keep silence in such a time;
<br>For it is an evil time.
<br>
<br>14Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live;
<br>And so the LORD, the God of hosts, will be with you, as ye say.
<br>15Hate the evil, and love the good, And establish justice in the gate;
<br> 
<br>It may be that the LORD, the God of hosts,
<br>Will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph.
<br>
<br>16Therefore thus saith the LORD, The God of hosts, the Lord:
<br>Lamentation shall be in all the broad places,
<br>And they shall say in all the streets: ‘Alas! alas! ’
<br>And they shall call the husbandman to mourning,
<br>And proclaim lamentation to such as are skilful of wailing.
<br>17And in all vineyards shall be lamentation;
<br>For I will pass through the midst of thee,
<br>Saith the LORD.
<br>
<br>18Woe unto you that desire the day of the LORD!
<br>Wherefore would ye have the day of the LORD?
<br>It is darkness, and not light.
<br>19As if a man did flee from a lion, And a bear met him;
<br>And went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall,
<br>And a serpent bit him.
<br>20Shall not the day of the LORD be darkness, and not light?
<br>Even very dark, and no brightness in it?
<br>21I hate, I despise your feasts,
<br>And I will take no delight in your solemn assemblies.
<br> 
<br>22Yea, though ye offer me burnt- offerings and your meal- offerings,
<br>I will not accept them;
<br>Neither will I regard the peace- offerings of your fat beasts.
<br>23Take thou away from Me the noise of thy songs;
<br>And let Me not hear the melody of thy psalteries.
<br>24But let justice well up as waters,
<br>And righteousness as a mighty stream.
<br>25Did ye bring unto Me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel? 26So shall ye take up Siccuth your king and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves. 27Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith He, whose name is the LORD God of hosts.
<br>
<br>Woe to them that are at ease in Zion,
<br>And to them that are secure in the mountain of Samaria,
<br>The notable men of the first of the nations,
<br>To whom the house of Israel come!
<br>2Pass ye unto Calneh, and see,
<br>And from thence go ye to Hamath the great;
<br>Then go down to Gath of the Philistines;
<br>Are they better than these kingdoms?
<br>Or is their border greater than your border?
<br> 
<br>3Ye that put far away the evil day,
<br>And cause the seat of violence to come near;
<br>4That lie upon beds of ivory,
<br>And stretch themselves upon their couches,
<br>And eat the lambs out of the flock,
<br>And the calves out of the midst of the stall;
<br>5That thrum on the psaltery,
<br>That devise for themselves instruments of music, like David;
<br>6That drink wine in bowls,
<br>And anoint themselves with the chief ointments;
<br>But they are not grieved for the hurt of Joseph.
<br>7Therefore now shall they go captive at the head of them that go captive,
<br>And the revelry of them that stretched themselves shall pass away.
<br>8The Lord GOD hath sworn by Himself,
<br>Saith the LORD, the God of hosts: I abhor the pride of Jacob,
<br>And hate his palaces;
<br>And I will deliver up the city with all that is therein.
<br>9And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten men in one house, that they shall die. 10And when a man’s uncle shall take him up, even he that burneth him, to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say unto him that is in the innermost parts of the house: ‘Is there yet any with thee?’ and he shall say: ‘No’; then shall he say: ‘Hold thy
<br> 
<br>peace; for we must not make mention of the name of the LORD.’
<br>
<br>11For, behold, the LORD commandeth,
<br>And the great house shall be smitten into splinters,
<br>And the little house into chips. 12Do horses run upon the rocks? Doth one plow there with oxen?
<br>That ye have turned justice into gall,
<br>And the fruit of righteousness into wormwood;
<br>13Ye that rejoice in a thing of nought,
<br>That say: ‘Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength?’
<br>14For, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, saith the LORD, the God of hosts; and they shall afflict you from the entrance of Hamath unto the Brook of the Arabah.
<br>
<br>Thus the Lord GOD showed me; and, behold, He formed locusts in
<br>the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, lo, it was the latter growth after the king’s mowings. 2And if it had come to pass, that when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land—so I said:
<br>O Lord GOD, forgive, I beseech Thee;
<br>How shall Jacob stand? for he is small.
<br>3The LORD repented concerning this; ‘It shall not be’, saith the LORD.
<br> 
<br>4Thus the Lord GOD showed me; and, behold, the Lord GOD called to contend by fire; and it devoured the great deep, and would have eaten up the land. 5Then said I:
<br>O Lord GOD, cease, I beseech Thee;
<br>How shall Jacob stand? for he is small.
<br>6The LORD repented concerning this; ‘This also shall not be’, saith the Lord GOD.
<br>
<br>7Thus He showed me; and, behold, the Lord stood beside a wall made by a plumbline, with a plumbline in His hand. 8And the LORD said unto me: ‘Amos, what seest thou?’ And I said: ‘A plumbline.’ Then said the Lord:
<br>Behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst of My people Israel;
<br>I will not again pardon them any more;
<br>9And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate,
<br>And the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste;
<br>And I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.
<br>
<br>10Then Amaziah the priest of Beth- el sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying: ‘Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel; the land is not able to bear all his words. 11For thus Amos saith:
<br>Jeroboam shall die by the sword,
<br>And Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.’
<br> 
<br>12Also Amaziah said unto Amos: ‘O thou seer, go, flee thee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there; 13but prophesy not again any more at Beth-el, for it is the king’s sanctuary, and it is a royal house.’ 14Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah: ‘I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet’s son; but I was a herdman, and a dresser of sycamore-trees; 15and the LORD took me from following the flock, and the LORD said unto me: Go, prophesy unto My people Israel. 16Now therefore hear thou the word of the LORD:
<br>Thou sayest: Prophesy not against Israel,
<br>And preach not against the house of Isaac;
<br>17Therefore thus saith the LORD:
<br>Thy wife shall be a harlot in the city,
<br>And thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword,
<br>And thy land shall be divided by line;
<br>And thou thyself shalt die in an unclean land,
<br>And Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.’
<br>
<br>Thus the Lord GOD showed me; and behold a basket of summer fruit. 2And He said: ‘Amos, what seest thou?’ And I said: ‘A basket of asummer fruit.’ Then said the LORD
<br>unto me:
<br>
<br>a Heb. kaiz
<br> 
<br>The aend is come upon My people Israel;
<br>I will not again pardon them any more.
<br>3And the songs of the palace shall be wailings in that day,
<br>Saith the Lord GOD;
<br>The dead bodies shall be many;
<br>In every place silence shall be cast.
<br>
<br>4Hear this, O ye that would swallow the needy,
<br>And destroy the poor of the land,
<br>5Saying: ‘When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell grain?
<br>And the sabbath, that we may set forth corn?
<br>Making the ephah small, and the shekel great,
<br>And falsifying the balances of deceit;
<br>6That we may buy the poor for silver,
<br>And the needy for a pair of shoes, And sell the refuse of the corn?’ 7The LORD hath sworn by the pride
<br>of Jacob:
<br>Surely I will never forget any of their works.
<br>8Shall not the land tremble for this,
<br>And every one mourn that dwelleth therein?
<br>Yea, it shall rise up wholly like the River;
<br>And it shall be troubled and sink again, like the River of Egypt.
<br>
<br>
<br>a Heb. kez
<br> 
<br>9And it shall come to pass in that day,
<br>Saith the Lord GOD,
<br>That I will cause the sun to go down at noon,
<br>And I will darken the earth in the clear day.
<br>10And I will turn your feasts into mourning,
<br>And all your songs into lamentation;
<br>And I will bring up sackcloth upon all loins,
<br>And baldness upon every head;
<br>And I will make it as the mourning for an only son,
<br>And the end thereof as a bitter day.
<br>
<br>11Behold, the days come, saith the Lord GOD,
<br>That I will send a famine in the land,
<br>Not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water,
<br>But of hearing the words of the LORD.
<br>12And they shall wander from sea to sea,
<br>And from the north even to the east;
<br>They shall run to and fro to seek the word of the LORD,
<br>And shall not find it.
<br>13In that day shall the fair virgins And the young men faint for thirst. 14They that swear by the sin of
<br>Samaria,
<br>And say: ‘As thy God, O Dan, liveth’;
<br>And: ‘As the way of Beer-sheba liveth’;
<br> 
<br>Even they shall fall, and never rise up again.
<br>
<br>I saw the Lord standing beside the altar; and He said:
<br>Smite the capitals, that the posts may shake;
<br>And break them in pieces on the head of all of them;
<br>And I will slay the residue of them with the sword;
<br>There shall not one of them flee away,
<br>And there shall not one of them escape.
<br>2Though they dig into the nether- world,
<br>Thence shall My hand take them;
<br>And though they climb up to heaven,
<br>Thence will I bring them down.
<br>3And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel,
<br>I will search and take them out thence;
<br>And though they be hid from My sight in the bottom of the sea,
<br>Thence will I command the serpent, and he shall bite them.
<br>4And though they go into captivity before their enemies,
<br>Thence will I command the sword, and it shall slay them;
<br>And I will set Mine eyes upon them For evil, and not for good.
<br>
<br>5For the Lord, the GOD of hosts,
<br>Is He that toucheth the land and it melteth,
<br> 
<br>And all that dwell therein mourn; And it riseth up wholly like the
<br>River,
<br>And sinketh again, like the River of Egypt;
<br>6It is He that buildeth His upper chambers in the heaven,
<br>And hath founded His vault upon the earth;
<br>He that calleth for the waters of the sea,
<br>And poureth them out upon the face of the earth;
<br>The LORD is His name.
<br>7Are ye not as the children of the Ethiopians unto Me,
<br>O children of Israel? saith the LORD.
<br>Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt,
<br>And the Philistines from Caphtor, And Aram from Kir?
<br>8Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD Are upon the sinful kingdom,
<br>And I will destroy it from off the face of the earth;
<br>Saving that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob,
<br>Saith the LORD.
<br>9For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all the nations,
<br>Like as corn is sifted in a sieve,
<br>Yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth.
<br>10All the sinners of My people shall die by the sword,
<br>That say: ‘The evil shall not overtake nor confront us.’
<br> 
<br>11In that day will I raise up The tabernacle of David that is
<br>fallen,
<br>And close up the breaches thereof, And I will raise up his ruins,
<br>And I will build it as in the days of old;
<br>12That they may possess the remnant of Edom,
<br>And all the nations, upon whom My name is called,
<br>Saith the LORD that doeth this.
<br>
<br>13Behold, the days come, saith the LORD,
<br>That the plowman shall overtake the reaper,
<br>And the treader of grapes him that soweth seed;
<br> 
<br>And the mountains shall drop sweet wine,
<br>And all the hills shall melt.
<br>14And I will turn the captivity of My people Israel,
<br>And they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit them;
<br>And they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof;
<br>They shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them.
<br>15And I will plant them upon their land,
<br>And they shall no more be plucked up
<br>Out of their land which I have given them,
<br>Saith the LORD thy God.

<br>1 The vision of Obadiah.
<br> 
<br>עבדיה
<br>OBADIAH
<br>3The pride of thy heart hath beguiled thee,
<br> 
<br>Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning Edom:
<br>We have heard a message from the LORD,
<br>And an ambassador is sent among the nations:
<br>‘Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle.’
<br>2Behold, I make thee small among the nations;
<br>Thou art greatly despised.
<br> 
<br>O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock,
<br>Thy habitation on high; That sayest in thy heart:
<br>‘Who shall bring me down to the ground?’
<br>4Though thou make thy nest as high as the eagle,
<br>And though thou set it among the stars,
<br> 
<br>I will bring thee down from thence, saith the LORD.
<br>5If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night—
<br>How art thou cut off!—
<br>Would they not steal till they had enough?
<br>If grape-gatherers came to thee,
<br>Would they not leave some gleaning grapes?
<br>6How is Esau searched out!
<br>How are his hidden places sought out!
<br>7All the men of thy confederacy Have conducted thee to the border;
<br>The men that were at peace with thee
<br>Have beguiled thee, and prevailed against thee;
<br>They that eat thy bread lay a snare under thee,
<br>In whom there is no discernment.
<br>8Shall I not in that day, saith the LORD,
<br>Destroy the wise men out of Edom,
<br>And discernment out of the mount of Esau?
<br>9And thy mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed,
<br>To the end that every one may be cut off from the mount of Esau by slaughter.
<br>10For the violence done to thy brother Jacob shame shall cover thee,
<br>And thou shalt be cut off for ever.
<br>11In the day that thou didst stand aloof,
<br> 
<br>In the day that strangers carried away his substance,
<br>And foreigners entered into his gates,
<br>And cast lots upon Jerusalem, Even thou wast as one of them.
<br>12But thou shouldest not have gazed on the day of thy brother
<br>In the day of his disaster,
<br>Neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah
<br>In the day of their destruction;
<br>Neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly
<br>In the day of distress.
<br>13Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of My people
<br>In the day of their calamity;
<br>Yea, thou shouldest not have gazed on their affliction
<br>In the day of their calamity,
<br>Nor have laid hands on their substance
<br>In the day of their calamity.
<br>14Neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway,
<br>To cut off those of his that escape;
<br>Neither shouldest thou have delivered up those of his
<br>That did remain in the day of distress.
<br>
<br>15For the day of the LORD is near upon all the nations;
<br>As thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee;
<br>Thy dealing shall return upon thine own head.
<br> 
<br>16For as ye have drunk upon My holy mountain,
<br>So shall all the nations drink continually,
<br>Yea, they shall drink, and swallow down,
<br>And shall be as though they had not been.
<br>17But in mount Zion there shall be those that escape,
<br>And it shall be holy;
<br>And the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions.
<br>18And the house of Jacob shall be a fire,
<br>And the house of Joseph a flame, And the house of Esau for stubble,
<br>And they shall kindle in them, and devour them;
<br>And there shall not be any remaining of the house of Esau;
<br> 
<br>For the LORD hath spoken.
<br>19And they of the South shall possess the mount of Esau, And they of the Lowland the
<br>Philistines;
<br>And they shall possess the field of Ephraim,
<br>And the field of Samaria;
<br>And Benjamin shall possess Gilead.
<br>20And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel,
<br>That are among the Canaanites, even unto Zarephath,
<br>And the captivity of Jerusalem, that is in Sepharad,
<br>Shall possess the cities of the South.
<br>21And saviours shall come up on mount Zion
<br>To judge the mount of Esau; And the kingdom shall be the
<br>LORD’S.

<br>יונה
<br>JONAH
<br> 
<br>Now the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the son of Amittai,
<br> 
<br>into it, to go with them unto Tarshish, from the presence of the LORD.
<br> 
<br>saying: 2’Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and proclaim against it; for their wickedness is come up before Me.’ 3But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD; and he went down to Joppa, and found a ship going to Tarshish; so he paid the fare thereof, and went down
<br> 
<br>4But the LORD hurled a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken. 5And the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god; and they cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it unto them. But Jonah was gone down into the innermost parts of
<br> 
<br>the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep. 6So the shipmaster came to him,	and		said	unto		him:		‘What meanest thou that thou sleepest? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not.’ 7And they said every one to his fellow: ‘Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us.’ So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah. 8Then said they unto him: ‘Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon us: what is	thine	occupation?	and	whence comest thou? what is thy country? and of what people art thou?’ 9And he said unto them: ‘I am an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD, the God of heaven, who hath made the sea and the dry land.’ 10Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him: ‘What is this that thou hast done?’ For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the LORD,
<br>because he had told them.
<br>11Then said they unto him: ‘What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us?’ for the sea grew more and more tempestuous. 12And he said unto them: ‘Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you; for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you.’ 13Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land; but they could not; for the sea grew more and more tempestuous against them. 14Wherefore they cried unto the LORD, and said: ‘We beseech Thee, O LORD, we beseech Thee, let us not perish for
<br> 
<br>this man’s life, and lay not upon us innocent blood; for Thou, O LORD, hast done as it pleased Thee.’ 15So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea; and the sea ceased from its raging. 16Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly; and they offered a sacrifice unto the LORD, and made vows.
<br>And the LORD prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah;   and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights. 2Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of
<br>the fish’s belly. 3And he said:
<br>I called out of mine affliction Unto the LORD, and He answered
<br>me;
<br>Out of the belly of the nether-world cried I,
<br>And Thou heardest my voice.
<br>4For Thou didst cast me into the depth,
<br>In the heart of the seas,
<br>And the flood was round about me; All Thy waves and Thy billows Passed over me.
<br>5And I said: ‘I am cast out From before Thine eyes’; Yet I will look again Toward Thy holy temple.
<br>6The waters compassed me about, even to the soul;
<br>The deep was round about me;
<br>The weeds were wrapped about my head.
<br>7I went down to the bottoms of the mountains;
<br> 
<br>The earth with her bars closed upon me for ever;
<br>Yet hast Thou brought up my life from the pit,
<br>O LORD my God.
<br>8When my soul fainted within me, I remembered the LORD;
<br>And my prayer came in unto Thee, Into Thy holy temple.
<br>9They that regard lying vanities Forsake their own mercy.
<br>10But I will sacrifice unto Thee With the voice of thanksgiving; That which I have vowed I will pay. Salvation is of the LORD.
<br>11And the LORD spoke unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.
<br>And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah   the   second   time, saying: 2’Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and make unto it the proclamation that I bid thee.’ 3So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city, of three days’journey. 4And Jonah began to enter into the city a day’s journey, and he proclaimed, and said: ‘Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be
<br>overthrown.’
<br>5And the people of Nineveh believed God; and they proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them. 6And the tidings reached the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in
<br> 
<br>ashes. 7And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying: ‘Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing; let them not feed, nor drink water; 8but let them be covered with sackcloth, both man and beast, and let them cry mightily unto God; yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands. 9Who knoweth whether God will not turn and repent, and turn away from His fierce anger, that we perish not?’
<br>10And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, which He said He would do unto them; and He
<br>did it not. 1But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was angry. 2And he prayed unto the LORD, and said: ‘I pray Thee, O LORD, was not this my saying, when I was yet in mine own	country?		Therefore	I	fled beforehand unto Tarshish; for I knew that Thou art a gracious God, and compassionate,	long-suffering,		and abundant in mercy, and repentest Thee of the evil. 3Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech Thee, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live.’ 4And the LORD said:  ‘Art thou
<br>greatly angry?’
<br>5Then Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become  of the  city. 6And  the
<br> 
<br>LORD God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his evil. So Jonah was exceeding glad because of the gourd. 7But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd, that it withered. 8And it came to pass, when the sun arose, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and requested for himself that he might die, and said: ‘It is better for me to die than to live.’
<br> 
<br>9And God said to Jonah: ‘Art thou greatly angry for the gourd?’ And he said: ‘I am greatly angry, even unto death.’ 10And the LORD said: ‘Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow, which came up in a night, and perished in a night; 11and should not I have pity on Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand, and also much cattle?’

<br>MICAH
<br> 
<br>The word of the LORD that came to Micah the   Morashtite   in   the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings	of	Judah,	which	he	saw
<br>concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.
<br>
<br>2Hear, ye peoples, all of you;
<br>Hearken, O earth, and all that therein is;
<br>And let the Lord GOD be witness against you,
<br>The Lord from His holy temple.
<br>3For, behold, the LORD cometh forth out of His place,
<br>And will come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth.
<br>4And the mountains shall be molten under Him,
<br> 
<br>And the valleys shall be cleft, As wax before the fire,
<br>As waters that are poured down a steep place.
<br>
<br>5For the transgression of Jacob is all this,
<br>And for the sins of the house of Israel.
<br>What is the transgression of Jacob?
<br>Is it not Samaria?
<br>And what are the high places of Judah? are they not Jerusalem?
<br>
<br>6Therefore I will make Samaria a heap in the field,
<br>A place for the planting of vineyards;
<br> 
<br>And I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley,
<br>And I will uncover the foundations thereof.
<br>7And all her graven images shall be beaten to pieces,
<br>And all her hires shall be burned with fire,
<br>And all her idols will I lay desolate;
<br>For of the hire of a harlot hath she gathered them,
<br>And unto the hire of a harlot shall they return.
<br>
<br>8For this will I wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked;
<br>I will make a wailing like the jackals,
<br>And a mourning like the ostriches.
<br>9For her wound is incurable; For it is come even unto Judah;
<br>It reacheth unto the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem.
<br>10Tell it not in Gath, Weep not at all;
<br>At Beth-le-aphrah roll thyself in the dust.
<br>11Pass ye away, O inhabitant of Saphir, in nakedness and shame;
<br>The inhabitant of Zaanan is not come forth;
<br>The wailing of Beth-ezel shall take from you the standing-place thereof.
<br>12For the inhabitant of Maroth waiteth anxiously for good;
<br>Because evil is come down from the LORD unto the gate of Jerusalem.
<br> 
<br>13Bind the chariots to the swift steeds, O inhabitant of Lachish;
<br>She was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion;
<br>For the transgressions of Israel are found in thee.
<br>14Therefore shalt thou give a parting gift to Moresheth-gath;
<br>The houses of Achzib shall be a deceitful thing unto the kings of Israel.
<br>15I will yet bring unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah, him that shall possess thee;
<br>The glory of Israel shall come even unto Adullam.
<br>16Make thee bald, and poll thee for the children of thy delight;
<br>Enlarge thy baldness as the vulture;
<br>For they are gone into captivity from thee.
<br>
<br>Woe to them that devise iniquity And work evil upon their beds!
<br>When the morning is light, they execute it,
<br>Because it is in the power of their hand.
<br>2And they covet fields, and seize them;
<br>And houses, and take them away;
<br>Thus they oppress a man and his house,
<br>Even a man and his heritage.
<br>3Therefore thus saith the LORD:
<br>Behold, against this family do I devise an evil,
<br>From which ye shall not remove your necks,
<br> 
<br>Neither shall ye walk upright; for it shall be an evil time.
<br>4In that day shall they take up a parable against you,
<br>And lament with a doleful lamentation, and say:
<br>‘We are utterly ruined;
<br>He changeth the portion of my people;
<br>How doth he remove it from me!
<br>Instead of restoring our fields, he divideth them.’
<br>5Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast the line by lot
<br>In the congregation of the LORD. 6’Preach ye not’, they preach; ‘They shall not preach of these
<br>things,
<br>That they shall not take shame.’ 7Do I change, O house of Jacob? Is the spirit of the LORD straitened? Are these His doings?
<br>Do not My words do good to him that walketh uprightly?
<br>
<br>8But of late My people is risen up as an enemy;
<br>With the garment ye strip also the mantle
<br>From them that pass by securely, so that they are as men returning from war.
<br>9The women of My people ye cast out from their pleasant houses;
<br>From their young children ye take away My glory for ever.
<br>10Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your resting-place;
<br> 
<br>Because of the uncleanness thereof, it shall destroy you, even with a sore destruction.
<br>
<br>11If a man walking in wind and falsehood do lie:
<br>‘I will preach unto thee of wine and of strong drink’;
<br>He shall even be the preacher of this people.
<br>
<br>12I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee;
<br>I will surely gather the remnant of Israel;
<br>I will render them all as sheep in a fold;
<br>As a flock in the midst of their pasture;
<br>They shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of men.
<br>13The breaker is gone up before them;
<br>They have broken forth and passed on,
<br>By the gate, and are gone out thereat;
<br>And their king is passed on before them,
<br>And the LORD at the head of them.
<br>
<br>And I said:
<br>Hear, I pray you, ye heads of Jacob,
<br>And rulers of the house of Israel: Is it not for you to know justice? 2Who hate the good, and love the
<br>evil;
<br>Who rob their skin from off them,
<br> 
<br>And their flesh from off their bones;
<br>3Who also eat the flesh of my people,
<br>And flay their skin from off them, And break their bones;
<br>Yea, they chop them in pieces, as that which is in the pot,
<br>And as flesh within the caldron. 4Then shall they cry unto the LORD, But He will not answer them;
<br>Yea, He will hide His face from them at that time,
<br>According as they have wrought evil in their doings.
<br>
<br>5Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that make my people to err;
<br>That cry: ‘Peace’, when their teeth have any thing to bite;
<br>And whoso putteth not into their mouths,
<br>They even prepare war against him:
<br>6Therefore it shall be night unto you, that ye shall have no vision;
<br>And it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine;
<br>And the sun shall go down upon the prophets,
<br>And the day shall be black over them.
<br>7And the seers shall be put to shame, and the diviners confounded;
<br>Yea, they shall all cover their upper lips;
<br>For there shall be no answer of God.
<br>8But I truly am full of power by the spirit of the LORD,
<br> 
<br>And of justice, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression,
<br>And to Israel his sin.
<br>
<br>9Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob,
<br>And rulers of the house of Israel,
<br>That abhor justice, and pervert all equity;
<br>10That build up Zion with blood, And Jerusalem with iniquity.
<br>11The heads thereof judge for reward,
<br>And the priests thereof teach for hire,
<br>And the prophets thereof divine for money;
<br>Yet will they lean upon the LORD, and say:
<br>‘Is not the LORD in the midst of us? No evil shall come upon us’?
<br>12Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field,
<br>And Jerusalem shall become heaps,
<br>And the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.
<br>
<br>But in the end of days it shall come to pass,
<br>That the mountain of the LORD’S house shall be established as the top of the mountains,
<br>And it shall be exalted above the hills;
<br>And peoples shall flow unto it. 2And many nations shall go and say: ‘Come ye, and let us go up to the
<br>mountain of the LORD,
<br> 
<br>And to the house of the God of Jacob;
<br>And He will teach us of His ways, And we will walk in His paths’;
<br>For out of Zion shall go forth the law,
<br>And the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
<br>3And He shall judge between many peoples,
<br>And shall decide concerning mighty nations afar off;
<br>And they shall beat their swords into plowshares,
<br>And their spears into pruninghooks;
<br>Nation shall not lift up sword against nation,
<br>Neither shall they learn war any more.
<br>4But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig-tree; And none shall make them afraid;
<br>For the mouth of the LORD of hosts hath spoken.
<br>
<br>5For let all the peoples walk each one in the name of its god,
<br>But we will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and ever.
<br>
<br>6In that day, saith the LORD, will I assemble her that halteth,
<br>And I will gather her that is driven away,
<br>And her that I have afflicted;
<br>7And I will make her that halted a remnant,
<br>And her that was cast far off a mighty nation;
<br> 
<br>And the LORD shall reign over them in mount Zion from thenceforth even for ever.
<br>
<br>8And thou, Migdal-eder, the hill of the daughter of Zion,
<br>Unto thee shall it come;
<br>Yea, the former dominion shall come,
<br>The kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.
<br>9Now why dost thou cry out aloud?
<br>Is there no King in thee, Is thy Counsellor perished,
<br>That pangs have taken hold of thee as of a woman in travail?
<br>10Be in pain, and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Zion,
<br>Like a woman in travail;
<br>For now shalt thou go forth out of the city,
<br>And shalt dwell in the field,
<br>And shalt come even unto Babylon; There shalt thou be rescued;
<br>There shall the LORD redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies.
<br>
<br>11And now many nations are assembled against thee,
<br>That say: ‘Let her be defiled, and let our eye gaze upon Zion.’
<br>12But they know not the thoughts of the LORD,
<br>Neither understand they His counsel;
<br>For He hath gathered them as the sheaves to the threshing-floor. 13Arise and thresh, O daughter of
<br>Zion;
<br> 
<br>For I will make thy horn iron, And I will make thy hoofs brass;
<br>And thou shalt beat in pieces many peoples;
<br>And thou shalt devote their gain unto the LORD,
<br>And their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth.
<br>
<br>14Now shalt thou gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops;
<br>They have laid siege against us;
<br>They smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek.
<br>
<br>But thou, Beth-lehem Ephrathah,
<br>Which art little to be among the thousands of Judah,
<br>Out of thee shall one come forth unto Me that is to be ruler in Israel;
<br>Whose goings forth are from of old, from ancient days.
<br>2Therefore will He give them up,
<br>Until the time that she who travaileth hath brought forth;
<br>Then the residue of his brethren shall return with the children of Israel.
<br>3And he shall stand, and shall feed his flock in the strength of the LORD,
<br>In the majesty of the name of the LORD his God;
<br>And they shall abide, for then shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.
<br>4And this shall be peace:
<br> 
<br>When the Assyrian shall come into our land,
<br>And when he shall tread in our palaces,
<br>Then shall we raise against him seven shepherds,
<br>And eight princes among men.
<br>5And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword,
<br>And the land of Nimrod with the keen-edged sword;
<br>And he shall deliver us from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land,
<br>And when he treadeth within our border.
<br>
<br>6And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many peoples,
<br>As dew from the LORD, as showers upon the grass,
<br>That are not looked for from man,
<br>Nor awaited at the hands of the sons of men.
<br>7And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the nations, in the midst of many peoples,
<br>As a lion among the beasts of the forest,
<br>As a young lion among the flocks of sheep,
<br>Who, if he go through, treadeth down and teareth in pieces,
<br>And there is none to deliver.
<br>8Let Thy hand be lifted up above Thine adversaries,
<br>And let all Thine enemies be cut off.
<br> 
<br>9And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD,
<br>That I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee,
<br>And will destroy thy chariots;
<br>10And I will cut off the cities of thy land,
<br>And will throw down all thy strongholds;
<br>11And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thy hand;
<br>And thou shalt have no more soothsayers;
<br>12And I will cut off thy graven images and thy pillars out of the midst of thee;
<br>And thou shalt no more worship the work of thy hands.
<br>13 And I will pluck up thy Asherim out of the midst of thee;
<br>And I will destroy thine enemies.
<br>14And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the nations,
<br>Because they hearkened not.
<br>
<br>Hear ye now what the LORD saith:
<br>Arise, contend thou before the mountains,
<br>And let the hills hear thy voice.
<br>2Hear, O ye mountains, the LORD’S controversy,
<br>And ye enduring rocks, the foundations of the earth;
<br>For the LORD hath a controversy with His people,
<br>And He will plead with Israel.
<br>3O My people, what have I done unto thee?
<br>And wherein have I wearied thee?
<br> 
<br>Testify against Me.
<br>4For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt,
<br>And redeemed thee out of the house of bondage,
<br>And I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.
<br>5O My people, remember now what Balak king of Moab devised,
<br>And what Balaam the son of Beor answered him;
<br>From Shittim unto Gilgal,
<br>That ye may know the righteous acts of the LORD.
<br>6’Wherewith shall I come before the LORD,
<br>And bow myself before God on high?
<br>Shall I come before Him with burnt- offerings,
<br>With calves of a year old?
<br>7Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams,
<br>With ten thousands of rivers of oil?
<br>Shall I give my first-born for my transgression,
<br>The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?’
<br>8It hath been told thee, O man, what is good,
<br>And what the LORD doth require of thee:
<br>Only to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.
<br>
<br>9Hark! the LORD crieth unto the city—
<br> 
<br>And it is wisdom to have regard for Thy name—
<br>Hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.
<br>10Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked,
<br>And the scant measure that is abominable?
<br>11’Shall I be pure with wicked balances,
<br>And with a bag of deceitful weights?’
<br>12For the rich men thereof are full of violence,
<br>And the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies,
<br>And their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.
<br>13Therefore I also do smite thee with a grievous wound;
<br>I do make thee desolate because of thy sins.
<br>14Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied;
<br>And thy sickness shall be in thine inward parts;
<br>And thou shalt conceive, but shalt not bring forth;
<br>And whomsoever thou bringest forth will I give up to the sword.
<br>15Thou shalt sow, but shalt not reap;
<br>Thou shalt tread the olives, but shalt not anoint thee with oil;
<br>And the vintage, but shalt not drink wine.
<br>16For the statutes of Omri are kept, And all the works of the house of
<br>Ahab,
<br>And ye walk in their counsels;
<br> 
<br>That I may make thee an astonishment,
<br>And the inhabitants thereof a hissing;
<br>And ye shall bear the reproach of My people.
<br>
<br>Woe is me! for I am as the last of the summer fruits,
<br>As the grape gleanings of the vintage;
<br>There is no cluster to eat;
<br>Nor first-ripe fig which my soul desireth.
<br>2The godly man is perished out of the earth,
<br>And the upright among men is no more;
<br>They all lie in wait for blood;
<br>They hunt every man his brother with a net.
<br>3Their hands are upon that which is evil to do it diligently;
<br>The prince asketh, and the judge is ready for a reward;
<br>And the great man, he uttereth the evil desire of his soul;
<br>Thus they weave it together.
<br>4The best of them is as a brier;
<br>The most upright is worse than a thorn hedge;
<br>The day of thy watchmen, even thy visitation, is come;
<br>Now shall be their perplexity.
<br>5Trust ye not in a friend,
<br>Put ye not confidence in a familiar friend;
<br>Keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom.
<br> 
<br>6For the son dishonoureth the father,
<br>The daughter riseth up against her mother,
<br>The daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;
<br>A man’s enemies are the men of his own house.
<br>
<br>7’But as for me, I will look unto the LORD;
<br>I will wait for the God of my salvation;
<br>My God will hear me.
<br>8Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy;
<br>Though I am fallen, I shall arise;
<br>Though I sit in darkness, the LORD is a light unto me.
<br>9I will bear the indignation of the LORD,
<br>Because I have sinned against Him;
<br>Until He plead my cause, and execute judgment for me;
<br>He will bring me forth to the light,
<br>And I shall behold His righteousness.
<br>10Then mine enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover her;
<br>Who said unto me: Where is the LORD thy God?
<br>Mine eyes shall gaze upon her;
<br>Now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets.’
<br>11’The day for building thy walls, even that day, shall be far removed.’
<br>12There shall be a day when they shall come unto thee,
<br> 
<br>From Assyria even to the cities of Egypt,
<br>And from Egypt even to the River,
<br>And from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain.
<br>13And the land shall be desolate for them that dwell therein,
<br>Because of the fruit of their doings.
<br>
<br>14Tend Thy people with Thy staff, the flock of Thy heritage,
<br>That dwell solitarily, as a forest in the midst of the fruitful field;
<br>Let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.
<br>15’As in the days of thy coming forth out of the land of Egypt
<br>Will I show unto him marvellous things.’
<br>16The nations shall see and be put to shame for all their might;
<br>They shall lay their hand upon their mouth,
<br>Their ears shall be deaf.
<br>17They shall lick the dust like a serpent;
<br>Like crawling things of the earth they shall come trembling out of their close places;
<br>They shall come with fear unto the LORD our God,
<br>And shall be afraid because of Thee.
<br>18Who is a God like unto Thee, that pardoneth the iniquity,
<br>And passeth by the transgression of the remnant of His heritage?
<br>He retaineth not His anger for ever, Because He delighteth in mercy.
<br> 
<br>19He will again have compassion upon us;
<br>He will subdue our iniquities;
<br>And Thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.
<br> 
<br>20Thou wilt show faithfulness to Jacob, mercy to Abraham,
<br>As Thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old.

<br>NAHUM
<br> 
<br>The burden of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the
<br>Elkoshite.
<br>2The LORD is a jealous and avenging God,
<br>The LORD avengeth and is full of wrath;
<br>The LORD taketh vengeance on His adversaries,
<br>And He reserveth wrath for His enemies.
<br>3The LORD is long-suffering, and great in power,
<br>And will by no means clear the guilty;
<br>The LORD, in the whirlwind and in the storm is His way,
<br>And the clouds are the dust of His feet.
<br>4He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry,
<br>And drieth up all the rivers; Bashan languisheth, and Carmel,
<br>And the flower of Lebanon languisheth.
<br>5The mountains quake at Him,
<br> 
<br>And the hills melt;
<br>And the earth is upheaved at His presence,
<br>Yea, the world, and all that dwell therein.
<br>6Who can stand before His indignation?
<br>And who can abide in the fierceness of His anger?
<br>His fury is poured out like fire,
<br>And the rocks are broken asunder before Him.
<br>7The LORD is good,
<br>A stronghold in the day of trouble;
<br>And He knoweth them that take refuge in Him.
<br>8But with an overrunning flood
<br>He will make a full end of the place thereof,
<br>And darkness shall pursue His enemies.
<br>9What do ye devise against the LORD?
<br>He will make a full end;
<br>Trouble shall not rise up the second time.
<br> 
<br>10For though they be like tangled thorns,
<br>And be drunken according to their drink,
<br>They shall be devoured as stubble fully dry.
<br>11Out of thee came he forth,
<br>That deviseth evil against the LORD, That counselleth wickedness.
<br>12Thus saith the LORD:
<br>Though they be in full strength, and likewise many,
<br>Even so shall they be cut down, and he shall pass away;
<br>And though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more.
<br>13And now will I break his yoke from off thee,
<br>And will burst thy bonds in sunder.
<br>14And the LORD hath given commandment concerning thee,
<br>That no more of thy name be sown;
<br>Out of the house of thy god will I cut off
<br>The graven image and the molten image;
<br>I will make thy grave; for thou art become worthless.
