<br>28th taxable year 	60 percent  
<br>29th taxable year 	80 percent  
<br>30th taxable year 	100 percent.
<br>
<br>(2) Earnings.—The earnings of a capital construction fund for any taxable year (except net gains) shall be treated under this subsection as an amount deposited for the taxable year.
<br>
<br>(3) Contract for qualified withdrawal.—Under paragraph (1), an amount shall not be treated as remaining in a capital construction fund at the close of a taxable year to the extent there is a binding contract at the close of the taxable year for a qualified withdrawal of the amount for an identified item for which the withdrawal may be made.
<br>
<br>(4) Excess earnings.—If the Secretary determines that the balance in a capital construction fund exceeds the amount appropriate to meet the vessel construction program objectives of the person that established the fund, the amount of the excess shall be treated as a nonqualified withdrawal under paragraph (1) unless the person develops appropriate program objectives within 3 years to dissipate the excess.
<br>
<br>(5) Amounts in fund on january 1, 1987.—Under this subsection, amounts in a capital construction fund on January 1, 1987, shall be treated as having been deposited in that fund on that date.
<br>
<br>(f) Tax Determinations.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—For a taxable year for which there is a nonqualified withdrawal (including an amount treated as a nonqualified withdrawal under subsection (e)), the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. ch. 1) shall be determined by—
<br>
<br>(A) excluding the withdrawal from gross income; and
<br>
<br>(B) increasing the tax imposed by chapter 1 of such Code by the product of the amount of the withdrawal and the highest tax rate specified in section 1 (or section 11 for a corporation) of such Code (26 U.S.C. 1, 11).
<br>
<br>(2) Maximum tax rate.—For that portion of a nonqualified withdrawal made from the capital gain account during a taxable year to which section 1(h) or 1201(a) 1 of such Code (26 U.S.C. 1(h), 1201(a)) applies, the tax rate used under paragraph (1)(B) may not exceed 20 percent (or 34 percent for a corporation).
<br>
<br>(3) Tax benefit rule.—If any portion of a nonqualified withdrawal is properly attributable to deposits (except earnings on deposits) made by the taxpayer in a taxable year that did not reduce the taxpayer's liability for tax under chapter 1 of such Code (26 U.S.C. ch. 1) for a taxable year before the taxable year in which the withdrawal occurs—
<br>
<br>(A) that portion shall not be taken into account under paragraph (1); and
<br>
<br>(B) an amount equal to that portion shall be allowed as a deduction under section 172 of such Code (26 U.S.C. 172) for the taxable year in which the withdrawal occurs.
<br>
<br>(4) Coordination with deduction for net operating losses.—A nonqualified withdrawal excluded from gross income under paragraph (1) shall be excluded in determining taxable income under section 172(b)(2) of such Code (26 U.S.C. 172(b)(2)).

<br>
<br>(A) all amounts paid by or for the account of the obligor as of the date on which a determination is made under section 53715(d)(1) of this title; and
<br>

<br>
<br>(B) if the vessel was reconstructed or reconditioned, the sum of—
<br>
<br>(i) the actual cost of the vessel depreciated on a straight line basis from the date of delivery by the builder to the date of the reconstruction or reconditioning, using the original useful life of the vessel, and from the date of the reconstruction or reconditioning, using a useful life of the vessel determined by the Secretary or Administrator; and
<br>
<br>(ii) any amount paid or obligated to be paid for the reconstruction or reconditioning, depreciated on a straight line basis using a useful life of the vessel determined by the Secretary or Administrator.

<br>In paragraph (2), the words "but shall not be limited to" are omitted as unnecessary.
<br>
<br>In paragraph (4)(B), the words "become or remain" are substituted for "be placed under or continued to be" for clarity.
<br>
<br>In paragraph (5)(B)(i), the words "individual who is a citizen of the United States" are substituted for "individual who is a citizen or national of the United States or a citizen of the Northern Mariana Islands" in 46 App. U.S.C. 1271(k) because of the definition of "citizen of the United States" in chapter 1 of the revised title. Citizens of the Northern Mariana Islands became citizens or non-citizen nationals of the United States (either of which is a "citizen of the United States" as defined in chapter 1 of the revised title) when the Covenant establishing the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands became effective on November 4, 1986.
<br>
<br>In paragraph (5)(B)(ii), the words "corporation, partnership, association, or other" are omitted as suplus [sic]. The words "the term 'State' as used therein includes any State, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands of the United States, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, or any other Commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States" in 46 App. U.S.C. 1271(k) are omitted as unnecessary because of the definitions of "State" and "United States" in chapter 1 of the revised title. The definition of "United States" in 46 App. U.S.C. 1271(m) is omitted as unnecessary because of the definition of "United States" in chapter 1. The words "and nationals of the United States or citizens of the Northern Mariana Islands shall be treated as citizens of the United States in meeting such ownership requirement" are omitted as unnecessary because of the definition of "citizen of the United States" in chapter 1 of the revised title.
<br>
<br>In paragraph (8), before subparagraph (A), the words "instrument of indebtedness" are substituted for "note, bond, debenture, or other evidence of indebtedness" to eliminate unnecessary words. In subparagraph (B), the reference to section 53717 is substituted for the reference to 46 App. U.S.C. 1272 because the accounts under section 53717 replace the Federal Ship Financing Fund. See the explanation for section 53717.
