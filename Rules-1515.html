<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13845. Establishing the President's National Council for the American Worker
<br>
<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13845, July 19, 2018, 83 F.R. 35099, as amended by Ex. Ord. No. 13853, §5, Dec. 12, 2018, 83 F.R. 65073; Ex. Ord. No. 13931, §1, June 26, 2020, 85 F.R. 39455, provided:
<br>
<br>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to provide a coordinated process for developing a national strategy to ensure that America's students and workers have access to affordable, relevant, and innovative education and job training that will equip them to compete and win in the global economy, and for monitoring the implementation of that strategy, it is hereby ordered as follows:
<br>
<br>Section 1. Purpose. Our Nation is facing a skills crisis. There are currently more than 6.7 million unfilled jobs in the United States, and American workers, who are our country's most valuable resource, need the skills training to fill them. At the same time, the economy is changing at a rapid pace because of the technology, automation, and artificial intelligence that is shaping many industries, from manufacturing to healthcare to retail. For too long, our country's education and job training programs have prepared Americans for the economy of the past. The rapidly changing digital economy requires the United States to view education and training as encompassing more than a single period of time in a traditional classroom. We need to prepare Americans for the 21st century economy and the emerging industries of the future. We must foster an environment of lifelong learning and skills-based training, and cultivate a demand-driven approach to workforce development. My Administration will champion effective, results-driven education and training so that American students and workers can obtain the skills they need to succeed in the jobs of today and of the future.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. Policy. It shall be the policy of the executive branch to work with private employers, educational institutions, labor unions, other non-profit organizations, and State, territorial, tribal, and local governments to update and reshape our education and job training landscape so that it better meets the needs of American students, workers, and businesses.
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. Establishment and Composition of the President's National Council for the American Worker. (a) There is hereby established the President's National Council for the American Worker (Council), co-chaired by the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Labor, the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, and the Advisor to the President overseeing the Office of Economic Initiatives (Co-Chairs).
<br>
<br>(b) In addition to the Co-Chairs, the Council shall include the following officials, or their designees:
<br>
<br>(i) the Secretary of the Treasury;
<br>
<br>(ii) the Secretary of Education;
<br>
<br>(iii) the Secretary of Veterans Affairs;
<br>
<br>(iv) the Director of the Office of Management and Budget;
<br>
<br>(v) the Administrator of the Small Business Administration;
<br>
<br>(vi) the Assistant to the President and Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy Coordination;
<br>
<br>(vii) the Director of the National Economic Council;
<br>
<br>(viii) the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers;
<br>
<br>(ix) the Director of the National Science Foundation; and
<br>
<br>(x) the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy.
<br>
<br>Sec. 4. Additional Invitees. As appropriate and consistent with applicable law, the Co-Chairs may, from time to time, invite the heads of other executive departments and agencies (agencies), or other senior officials in the White House Office, to attend meetings of the Council.
<br>
<br>Sec. 5. Council Meetings. The Co-Chairs shall convene meetings of the Council at least once per quarter.
<br>
<br>Sec. 6. Functions of the Council. (a) The Council shall develop recommendations for the President on policy and strategy related to the American workforce, and perform such other duties as the President may from time to time prescribe.
<br>
<br>(b) The Council shall develop recommendations for:
<br>
<br>(i) a national strategy for empowering American workers, which shall include recommendations on how the Federal Government can work with private employers, educational institutions, labor unions, other non-profit organizations, and State, territorial, tribal, and local governments to create and promote workforce development strategies that provide evidence-based, affordable education and skills-based training for youth and adults to prepare them for the jobs of today and of the future;
<br>
<br>(ii) fostering close coordination, cooperation, and information exchange among the Federal Government, private employers, educational institutions, labor unions, other non-profit organizations, and State, territorial, tribal, and local governments as related to issues concerning the education and training of Americans; and
<br>
<br>(iii) working with agencies to foster consistency in implementing policies and actions developed under this order.
<br>
<br>Sec. 7. Initial Tasks of Council. Within 180 days of the date of this order [July 19, 2018], the Council shall:
<br>
<br>(a) develop a national campaign to raise awareness of matters considered by the Council, such as the urgency of the skills crisis; the importance of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education; the creation of new industries and job opportunities spurred by emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence; the nature of many careers in the trades and manufacturing; and the need for companies to invest in the training and re-training of their workers and more clearly define the skills and competencies that jobs require;
<br>
<br>(b) develop a plan for recognizing companies that demonstrate excellence in workplace education, training, and re-training policies and investments, in order to galvanize industries to identify and adopt best practices, innovate their workplace policies, and invest in their workforces;
<br>
<br>(c) examine how the Congress and the executive branch can work with private employers, educational institutions, labor unions, other non-profit organizations, and State, territorial, tribal, and local governments to support the implementation of recommendations from the Task Force on Apprenticeship Expansion established in Executive Order 13801 of June 15, 2017 (Expanding Apprenticeships in America) [29 U.S.C. 50 note], including recommendations related to:
<br>
<br>(i) developing and increasing the use of industry-recognized, portable credentials by experienced workers seeking further education, displaced workers seeking skills to secure new jobs, students enrolled in postsecondary education, and younger Americans who are exploring career and education options before entering the workforce;
<br>
<br>(ii) increasing apprenticeship, earn-and-learn, and work-based learning opportunities;
<br>
<br>(iii) expanding the use of online learning resources; and
<br>
<br>(iv) increasing the number of partnerships around the country between companies, local educational institutions, and other entities, including local governments, labor unions, workforce development boards, and other non-profit organizations, in an effort to understand the types of skills that are required by employers so that educational institutions can recalibrate their efforts toward the development and delivery of more effective training programs.
<br>
<br>(d) consider the recommendations of the American Workforce Policy Advisory Board (Board) established in section 8 of this order and, as appropriate, adopt recommendations that would significantly advance the objectives of the Council;
<br>
<br>(e) recommend a specific course of action for increasing transparency related to education and job-training program options, including those offered at 4-year institutions and community colleges. The Council shall also propose ways to increase access to available job data, including data on industries and geographic locations with the greatest numbers of open jobs and projected future opportunities, as well as the underlying skills required to fill open jobs, so that American students and workers can make the most informed decisions possible regarding their education, job selection, and career paths.
