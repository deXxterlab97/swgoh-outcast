<br>23	He that hateth me, hateth my Father also. 24 If I had not done among them the works that no other man hath done, they would not have sin; but now they have both seen and hated
<br>both me and my Father.
<br>25	But that the word may be fulfilled which is written in their law: They hated me without cause.
<br>26	But when the Paraclete cometh, whom I will send you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceedeth from the Father, he shall give testimony of me.
<br>27	And you shall give testimony, because you are with me from the beginning.
<br>
<br>Chapter 16
<br>These things have I spoken to you, that you may not be scandalized.
<br>2	They will put you out of the synagogues: yea, the hour cometh, that whosoever killeth you, will think that he doth a service to God.
<br>3	And these things will they do to you; be- cause they have not known the Father, nor me. 4 But these things I have told you, that when the hour shall come, you may remember that I
<br> 
<br>told you of them.
<br>5	But I told you not these things from the beginning, because I was with you. And now I go to him that sent me, and none of you asketh me: Whither goest thou?
<br>6	But because I have spoken these things to you, sorrow hath filled your heart.
<br>7	But I tell you the truth: it is expedient to you that I go: for if I go not, the Paraclete will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you.
<br>8	And when he is come, he will convince the world of sin, and of justice, and of judgment.
<br>9	Of sin: because they believed not in me.
<br>10	And of justice: because I go to the Father; and you shall see me no longer.
<br>11	And of judgment: because the prince of this world is already judged.
<br>12	I have yet many things to say to you: but you cannot bear them now.
<br>13	But when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will teach you all truth. For he shall not speak of himself; but what things soever he shall hear, he shall speak; and the things that are to come, he shall shew you.
<br>14	He shall glorify me; because he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it to you.
<br>15	All things whatsoever the Father hath, are mine. Therefore I said, that he shall receive of mine, and shew it to you.
<br>16	A little while, and now you shall not see me; and again a little while, and you shall see me: because I go to the Father.
<br>17	Then some of the disciples said one to an- other: What is this that he saith to us: A little while, and you shall not see me; and again a lit- tle while, and you shall see me, and, because I go to the Father?
<br>18	They said therefore: What is this that he saith, A little while? we know not what he
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>speaketh.
<br>19	And Jesus knew that they had a mind to ask him; and he said to them: Of this do you inquire among yourselves, because I said: A little while, and you shall not see me; and again a little while, and you shall see me?
<br>20	Amen, amen I say to you, that you shall lament and weep, but the world shall rejoice; and you shall be made sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.
<br>21	A woman, when she is in labour, hath sor- row, because her hour is come; but when she hath brought forth the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.
<br>22	So also you now indeed have sorrow; but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice; and your joy no man shall take from you.
<br>23	And in that day you shall not ask me any thing. Amen, amen I say to you: if you ask the Father any thing in my name, he will give it you. 24 Hitherto you have not asked any thing in my name. Ask, and you shall receive; that your
<br>joy may be full.
<br>25	These things I have spoken to you in proverbs. The hour cometh, when I will no more speak to you in proverbs, but will shew you plainly of the Father.
<br>26	In that day you shall ask in my name; and I say not to you, that I will ask the Father for you:
<br>27	For the Father himself loveth you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.
<br>28	I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again I leave the world, and I go to the Father.
<br>29	His disciples say to him: Behold, now thou speakest plainly, and speakest no proverb.
<br>30	Now we know that thou knowest all things,
<br> 
<br>and thou needest not that any man should ask thee. By this we believe that thou camest forth from God.
<br>31	Jesus answered them: Do you now believe? 32 Behold, the hour cometh, and it is now come, that you shall be scattered every man to his own, and shall leave me alone; and yet I am
<br>not alone, because the Father is with me.
<br>33 These things I have spoken to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you shall have distress: but have confidence, I have overcome the world.
<br>
<br>Chapter 17
<br>These things Jesus spoke, and lifting up his eyes to heaven, he said: Father, the hour is come, glorify thy Son, that thy Son may glorify thee.
<br>2	As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he may give eternal life to all whom thou hast given him.
<br>3	Now this is eternal life: That they may know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.
<br>4	I have glorified thee on the earth; I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.
<br>5	And now glorify thou me, O Father, with thyself, with the glory which I had, before the world was, with thee.
<br>6	I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou hast given me out of the world. Thine they were, and to me thou gavest them; and they have kept thy word.
<br>7	Now they have known, that all things which thou hast given me, are from thee:
<br>8	Because the words which thou gavest me, I have given to them; and they have received them, and have known in very deed that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>didst send me.
<br>9	I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them whom thou hast given me: because they are thine:
<br>10	And all my things are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.
<br>11	And now I am not in the world, and these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Fa- ther, keep them in thy name whom thou has given me; that they may be one, as we also are. 12 While I was with them, I kept them in thy name. Those whom thou gavest me have I kept; and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition,
<br>that the scripture may be fulfilled.
<br>13	And now I come to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy filled in themselves.
<br>14	I have given them thy word, and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world; as I also am not of the world.
<br>15	I pray not that thou shouldst take them out of the world, but that thou shouldst keep them from evil.
<br>16	They are not of the world, as I also am not of the world.
<br>17	Sanctify them in truth. Thy word is truth.
<br>18	As thou hast sent me into the world, I also have sent them into the world.
<br>19	And for them do I sanctify myself, that they also may be sanctified in truth.
<br>20	And not for them only do I pray, but for them also who through their word shall believe in me;
<br>21	That they all may be one, as thou, Father, in me, and I in thee; that they also may be one in us; that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.
<br>22	And the glory which thou hast given me, I have given to them; that they may be one, as we also are one:
<br> 
<br>23	I in them, and thou in me; that they may be made perfect in one: and the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast also loved me.
<br>24	Father, I will that where I am, they also whom thou hast given me may be with me; that they may see my glory which thou hast given me, because thou hast loved me before the creation of the world.
<br>25	Just Father, the world hath not known thee; but I have known thee: and these have known that thou hast sent me.
<br>26	And I have made known thy name to them, and will make it known; that the love wherewith thou hast loved me, may be in them, and I in them.
<br>
<br>Chapter 18
<br>When Jesus had said these things, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where there was a garden, into which he entered with his disciples.
<br>2	And Judas also, who betrayed him, knew the place; because Jesus had often resorted thither together with his disciples.
<br>3	Judas therefore having received a band of soldiers and servants from the chief priests and the Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.
<br>4	Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said to them: Whom seek ye?
<br>5	They answered him: Jesus of Nazareth. Je- sus saith to them: I am he. And Judas also, who betrayed him, stood with them.
<br>6	As soon therefore as he had said to them: I am he; they went backward, and fell to the ground.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>7	Again therefore he asked them: Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.
<br>8	Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he. If therefore you seek me, let these go their way.
<br>9	That the word might be fulfilled which he said: Of them whom thou hast given me, I have not lost any one.
<br>10	Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it, and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear. And the name of the servant was Malchus.
<br>11	Jesus therefore said to Peter: Put up thy sword into the scabbard. The chalice which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?
<br>12	Then the band and the tribune, and the servants of the Jews, took Jesus, and bound him: 13 And they led him away to Annas first, for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the
<br>high priest of that year.
<br>14	Now Caiphas was he who had given the counsel to the Jews: That it was expedient that one man should die for the people.
<br>15	And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple.   And that disciple was known to the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the court of the high priest.
<br>16	But Peter stood at the door without. The other disciple therefore, who was known to the high priest, went out, and spoke to the portress, and brought in Peter.
<br>17	The maid therefore that was portress, saith to Peter: Art not thou also one of this man’s disciples? He saith:  I am not.
<br>18	Now the servants and ministers stood at a fire of coals, because it was cold, and warmed themselves. And with them was Peter also, standing, and warming himself.
<br>19	The high priest therefore asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.
<br> 
<br>20	Jesus answered him: I have spoken openly to the world: I have always taught in the syna- gogue, and in the temple, whither all the Jews resort; and in secret I have spoken nothing.
<br>21	Why asketh thou me? ask them who have heard what I have spoken unto them: behold they know what things I have said.
<br>22	And when he had said these things, one of the servants standing by, gave Jesus a blow, saying: Answerest thou the high priest so?
<br>23	Jesus answered him: If I have spoken evil, give testimony of the evil; but if well, why strik- est thou me?
<br>24	And Annas sent him bound to Caiphas the high priest.
<br>25	And Simon Peter was standing, and warm- ing himself. They said therefore to him: Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said: I am not.
<br>26	One of the servants of the high priest (a kinsman to him whose ear Peter cut off) saith to him: Did I not see thee in the garden with him? 27 Again therefore Peter denied; and immedi-
<br>ately the cock crew.
<br>28	Then they led Jesus from Caiphas to the governor’s hall. And it was morning; and they went not into the hall, that they might not be defiled, but that they might eat the pasch.
<br>29	Pilate therefore went out to them, and said: What accusation bring you against this man?
<br>30	They answered, and said to him: If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up to thee.
<br>31	Pilate therefore said to them: Take him you, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said to him: It is not lawful for us to put any man to death;
<br>32	That the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he said, signifying what death he should die.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>33	Pilate therefore went into the hall again, and called Jesus, and said to him: Art thou the king of the Jews?
<br>34	Jesus answered: Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or have others told it thee of me?
<br>35	Pilate answered: Am I a Jew? Thy own nation, and the chief priests, have delivered thee up to me: what hast thou done?
<br>36	Jesus answered: My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would certainly strive that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now my kingdom is not from hence.
<br>37	Pilate therefore said to him: Art thou a king then? Jesus answered: Thou sayest that I am a king. For this was I born, and for this came I into the world; that I should give testimony to the truth. Every one that is of the truth, heareth my voice.
<br>38	Pilate saith to him: What is truth? And when he said this, he went out again to the Jews, and saith to them: I find no cause in him.
<br>39	But you have a custom that I should release one unto you at the pasch: will you, therefore, that I release unto you the king of the Jews?
<br>40	Then cried they all again, saying: Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a rob- ber.
<br>
<br>Chapter 19
<br>Then therefore, Pilate took Jesus, and scourged him.
<br>2	And the soldiers platting a crown of thorns, put it upon his head; and they put on him a purple garment.
<br>3	And they came to him, and said: Hail, king of the Jews; and they gave him blows.
<br>4	Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith
<br> 
<br>to them: Behold, I bring him forth unto you, that you may know that I find no cause in him.
<br>5	(Jesus therefore came forth, bearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment.) And he saith to them: Behold the Man.
<br>6	When the chief priests, therefore, and the servants, had seen him, they cried out, saying: Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith to them: Take him you, and crucify him: for I find no cause in him.
<br>7	The Jews answered him: We have a law; and according to the law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.
<br>8	When Pilate therefore had heard this saying, he feared the more.
<br>9	And he entered into the hall again, and he said to Jesus: Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.
<br>10	Pilate therefore saith to him: Speakest thou not to me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and I have power to release thee?
<br>11	Jesus answered: Thou shouldst not have any power against me, unless it were given thee from above. Therefore, he that hath delivered me to thee, hath the greater sin.
<br>12	And from henceforth Pilate sought to re- lease him. But the Jews cried out, saying: If thou release this man, thou art not Caesar’s friend. For whosoever maketh himself a king, speaketh against Caesar.
<br>13	Now when Pilate had heard these words, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judg- ment seat, in the place that is called Lithostro- tos, and in Hebrew Gabbatha.
<br>14	And it was the parasceve of the pasch, about the sixth hour, and he saith to the Jews: Behold your king.
<br>15	But they cried out: Away with him; away with him; crucify him. Pilate saith to them:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Shall I crucify your king? The chief priests an- swered: We have no king but Caesar.
<br>16	Then therefore he delivered him to them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him forth.
<br>17	And bearing his own cross, he went forth to that place which is called Calvary, but in Hebrew Golgotha.
<br>18	Where they crucified him, and with him two others, one on each side, and Jesus in the midst.
<br>19	And Pilate wrote a title also,  and he put it upon the cross. And the writing was: JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
<br>20	This title therefore many of the Jews did read: because the place where Jesus was cruci- fied was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, in Greek, and in Latin.
<br>21	Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate: Write not, The King of the Jews;  but that he said, I am the King of the Jews.
<br>22	Pilate answered: What I have written, I have written.
<br>23	The soldiers therefore, when they had cru- cified him, took his garments, (and they made four parts, to every soldier a part,) and also his coat. Now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.
<br>24	They said then one to another: Let us not cut it, but let us cast lots for it, whose it shall be; that the scripture might be fulfilled, saying: They have parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture they have cast lot. And the soldiers indeed did these things.
<br>25	Now there stood by the cross of Jesus, his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalen.
<br>26	When Jesus therefore had seen his mother and the disciple standing whom he loved, he saith to his mother: Woman, behold thy son.
<br> 
<br>27	After that, he saith to the disciple: Behold thy mother. And from that hour, the disciple took her to his own.
<br>28	Afterwards, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, said:  I thirst.
<br>29	Now there was a vessel set there full of vine- gar. And they, putting a sponge full of vinegar and hyssop, put it to his mouth.
<br>30	Jesus therefore, when he had taken the vinegar, said: It is consummated. And bowing his head, he gave up the ghost.
<br>31	Then the Jews, (because it was the parasceve,) that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the sabbath day, (for that was a great sabbath day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.
<br>32	The soldiers therefore came; and they broke the legs of the first, and of the other that was crucified with him.
<br>33	But after they were come to Jesus, when they saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.
<br>34	But one of the soldiers with a spear opened his side, and immediately there came out blood and water.
<br>35	And he that saw it, hath given testimony, and his testimony is true. And he knoweth that he saith true; that you also may believe.
<br>36	For these things were done, that the scrip- ture might be fulfilled: You shall not break a bone of him.
<br>37	And again another scripture saith: They shall look on him whom they pierced.
<br>38	And after these things, Joseph of Ari- mathea (because he was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews) besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus. And Pi- late gave leave. He came therefore, and took the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>body of Jesus.
<br>39	And Nicodemus also came, (he who at the first came to Jesus by night,) bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.
<br>40	They took therefore the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen cloths, with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.
<br>41	Now there was in the place where he was crucified, a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein no man yet had been laid.
<br>42	There, therefore, because of the parasceve of the Jews, they laid Jesus, because the sepul- chre was nigh at hand.
<br>
<br>Chapter 20
<br>And on the first day of the week, Mary Mag- dalen cometh early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre; and she saw the stone taken away from the sepulchre.
<br>2	She ran, therefore, and cometh to Simon Pe- ter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and saith to them: They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him.
<br>3	Peter therefore went out, and that other dis- ciple, and they came to the sepulchre.
<br>4	And they both ran together, and that other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre.
<br>5	And when he stooped down, he saw the linen cloths lying; but yet he went not in.
<br>6	Then cometh Simon Peter, following him, and went into the sepulchre, and saw the linen cloths lying,
<br>7	And the napkin that had been about his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but apart, wrapped up into one place.
<br> 
<br>8	Then that other disciple also went in, who came first to the sepulchre: and he saw, and be- lieved.
<br>9	For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.
<br>10	The disciples therefore departed again to their home.
<br>11	But Mary stood at the sepulchre without, weeping. Now as she was weeping, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre,
<br>12	And she saw two angels in white, sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had been laid.
<br>13	They say to her: Woman, why weepest thou? She saith to them: Because they have taken away my Lord; and I know not where they have laid him.
<br>14	When she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing; and she knew not that it was Jesus.
<br>15	Jesus saith to her: Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, thinking it was the gardener, saith to him: Sir, if thou hast taken him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.
<br>16	Jesus saith to her:   Mary.	She turning, saith to him: Rabboni (which is to say, Master). 17 Jesus saith to her: Do not touch me, for
<br>I am not yet ascended to my Father. But go to my brethren, and say to them: I ascend to my Father and to your Father, to my God and your God.
<br>18	Mary Magdalen cometh, and telleth the disciples: I have seen the Lord, and these things he said to me.
<br>19	Now when it was late that same day, the first of the week, and the doors were shut, where the disciples were gathered together, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them: Peace be to you.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>20	And when he had said this, he shewed them his hands and his side. The disciples therefore were glad, when they saw the Lord.
<br>21	He said therefore to them again: Peace be to you. As the Father hath sent me, I also send you.
<br>22	When he had said this, he breathed on them; and he said to them: Receive ye the Holy Ghost.
<br>23	Whose sins you shall forgive, they are for- given them; and whose sins you shall retain, they are retained.
<br>24	Now Thomas, one of the twelve, who is called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.
<br>25	The other disciples therefore said to him: We have seen the Lord. But he said to them: Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the place of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.
<br>26	And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them. Jesus cometh, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said:  Peace be to you.
<br>27	Then he saith to Thomas: Put in thy fin- ger hither, and see my hands; and bring hither thy hand, and put it into my side; and be not faithless, but believing.
<br>28	Thomas answered, and said to him: My Lord, and my God.
<br>29	Jesus saith to him: Because thou hast seen me, Thomas, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and have believed.
<br>30	Many other signs also did Jesus in the sight of his disciples, which are not written in this book.
<br>31	But these are written, that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God: and that believing, you may have life in his name.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 21
<br>After this, Jesus shewed himself again to the dis- ciples at the sea of Tiberias. And he shewed himself after this manner.
<br>2	There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas, who is called Didymus, and Nathanael, who was of Cana of Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples.
<br>3	Simon Peter saith to them: I go a fishing. They say to him: We also come with thee. And they went forth, and entered into the ship: and that night they caught nothing.
<br>4	But when the morning was come, Jesus stood on the shore: yet the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.
<br>5	Jesus therefore said to them: Children, have you any meat? They answered him: No.
<br>6	He saith to them: Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and you shall find. They cast therefore; and now they were not able to draw it, for the multitude of fishes.
<br>7	That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved, said to Peter: It is the Lord. Simon Peter, when he heard that it was the Lord, girt his coat about him, (for he was naked,) and cast himself into the sea.
<br>8	But the other disciples came in the ship, (for they were not far from the land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.
<br>9	As soon then as they came to land, they saw hot coals lying, and a fish laid thereon, and bread.
<br>10	Jesus saith to them: Bring hither of the fishes which you have now caught.
<br>11	Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land, full of great fishes, one hundred and fifty- three. And although there were so many, the net was not broken.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>12	Jesus saith to them: Come, and dine. And none of them who were at meat, durst ask him: Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.
<br>13	And Jesus cometh and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish in like manner.
<br>14	This is now the third time that Jesus was manifested to his disciples, after he was risen from the dead.
<br>15	When therefore they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter: Simon son of John, lovest thou me more than these? He saith to him: Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. He saith to him: Feed my lambs.
<br>16	He saith to him again: Simon, son of John, lovest thou me? He saith to him: Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. He saith to him: Feed my lambs.
<br>17	He said to him the third time: Simon, son of John, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved, be- cause he had said to him the third time: Lovest thou me? And he said to him: Lord, thou know- est all things: thou knowest that I love thee. He said to him: Feed my sheep.
<br>18	Amen, amen I say to thee, when thou wast younger, thou didst gird thyself, and didst walk where thou wouldst. But when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and an- other shall gird thee, and lead thee whither thou wouldst not.
<br>19	And this he said, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had said this, he saith to him: Follow me.
<br>20	Peter turning about, saw that disciple whom Jesus loved following, who also leaned on his breast at supper, and said: Lord, who is he that shall betray thee?
<br>21	Him therefore when Peter had seen, he saith to Jesus: Lord, and what shall this man do?
<br>22	Jesus saith to him: So I will have him to
<br> 
<br>remain till I come, what is it to thee? follow thou me.
<br>23	This saying therefore went abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die. And Jesus did not say to him: He should not die; but, So I will have him to remain till I come, what is it to thee?
<br>24	This is that disciple who giveth testimony of these things, and hath written these things; and we know that his testimony is true.
<br>25	But there are also many other things which Jesus did; which, if they were written every one, the world itself, I think, would not be able to contain the books that should be written.

<br>3	To whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion, by many proofs, for forty days ap- pearing to them, and speaking of the kingdom of God.
<br>4	And eating together with them, he com- manded them, that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but should wait for the promise of the Father, which you have heard (saith he) by my mouth.
<br>5	For John indeed baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost, not many days hence.
<br>6	They therefore who were come together, asked him, saying: Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?
<br>7	But he said to them: It is not for you to know the times or moments, which the Father hath put in his own power:
<br>8	But you shall receive the power of the Holy Ghost coming upon you, and you shall be wit- nesses unto me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and Samaria, and even to the uttermost part of the earth.
<br>9	And when he had said these things, while
<br> 
<br>they looked on, he was raised up: and a cloud received him out of their sight.
<br>10	And while they were beholding him going up to heaven, behold two men stood by them in white garments.
<br>11	Who also said: Ye men of Galilee, why stand you looking up to heaven? This Jesus who is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come, as you have seen him going into heaven.
<br>12	Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount that is called Olivet, which is nigh Jerusalem, within a sabbath day’s journey.
<br>13	And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode Peter and John, James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James of Alpheus, and Simon Zelotes, and Jude the brother of James.
<br>14	All these were persevering with one mind in prayer with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.
<br>15	In those days Peter rising up in the midst of the brethren, said: (now the number of persons together was about an hundred and twenty:)
<br>16	Men, brethren, the scripture must needs be fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who was the leader of them that apprehended Jesus:
<br>17	Who was numbered with us, and had ob- tained part of this ministry.
<br>18	And he indeed hath possessed a field of
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>the reward of iniquity, and being hanged, burst asunder in the midst: and all his bowels gushed out.
<br>19	And it became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem: so that the same field was called in their tongue, Haceldama, that is to say, The field of blood.
<br>20	For it is written in the book of Psalms: Let their habitation become desolate, and let there be none to dwell therein. And his bishopric let another take.
<br>21	Wherefore of these men who have com- panied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us,
<br>22	Beginning from the baptism of John, until the day wherein he was taken up from us, one of these must be made a witness with us of his resurrection.
<br>23	And they appointed two, Joseph, called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.
<br>24	And praying, they said: Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen,
<br>25	To take the place of this ministry and apos- tleship, from which Judas hath by transgression fallen, that he might go to his own place.
<br>26	And they gave them lots, and the lot fell upon Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.
<br>
<br>Chapter 2
<br>And when the days of the Pentecost were accom- plished, they were all together in one place:
<br>2	And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a mighty wind coming, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.
<br>3	And there appeared to them parted tongues
<br> 
<br>as it were of fire, and it sat upon every one of them:
<br>4	And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they began to speak with divers tongues, according as the Holy Ghost gave them to speak. 5 Now there were dwelling at Jerusalem, Jews,
<br>devout men, out of every nation under heaven.
<br>6	And when this was noised abroad, the mul- titude came together, and were confounded in mind, because that every man heard them speak in his own tongue.
<br>7	And they were all amazed, and wondered, saying: Behold, are not all these, that speak, Galileans?
<br>8	And how have we heard, every man our own tongue wherein we were born?
<br>9	Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and inhabitants of Mesopotamia, Judea, and Cap- padocia, Pontus and Asia,
<br>10	Phrygia, and Pamphylia, Egypt, and the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome,
<br>11	Jews also, and proselytes, Cretes, and Ara- bians: we have heard them speak in our own tongues the wonderful works of God.
<br>12	And they were all astonished, and won- dered, saying one to another: What meaneth this?
<br>13	But others mocking, said: These men are full of new wine.
<br>14	But Peter standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and spoke to them: Ye men of Judea, and all you that dwell in Jerusalem, be this known to you, and with your ears receive my words.
<br>15	For these are not drunk, as you suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day:
<br>16	But this is that which was spoken of by the prophet Joel:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>17	And it shall come to pass, in the last days, (saith the Lord,) I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams.
<br>18	And upon my servants indeed, and upon my handmaids will I pour out in those days of my spirit, and they shall prophesy.
<br>19	And I will shew wonders in the heaven above, and signs on the earth beneath: blood and fire, and vapour of smoke.
<br>20	The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and man- ifest day of the Lord come.
<br>21	And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord, shall be saved.
<br>22	Ye men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you, by miracles, and wonders, and signs, which God did by him, in the midst of you, as you also know: 23 This same being delivered up, by the deter- minate counsel and foreknowledge of God, you by the hands of wicked men have crucified and
<br>slain.
<br>24	Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the sorrows of hell, as it was impossible that he should be holden by it.
<br>25	For David saith concerning him: I foresaw the Lord before my face: because he is at my right hand, that I may not be moved.
<br>26	For this my heart hath been glad, and any tongue hath rejoiced: moreover my flesh also shall rest in hope.
<br>27	Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, nor suffer thy Holy One to see corruption.
<br>28	Thou hast made known to me the ways of life: thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.
<br>29	Ye men, brethren, let me freely speak to
<br> 
<br>you of the patriarch David; that he died, and was buried; and his sepulchre is with us to this present day.
<br>30	Whereas therefore he was a prophet, and knew that God hath sworn to him with an oath, that of the fruit of his loins one should sit upon his throne.
<br>31	Foreseeing this, he spoke of the resurrection of Christ. For neither was he left in hell, neither did his flesh see corruption.
<br>32	This Jesus hath God raised again, whereof all we are witnesses.
<br>33	Being exalted therefore by the right hand of God, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath poured forth this which you see and hear.
<br>34	For David ascended not into heaven; but he himself said: The Lord said to my Lord, sit thou on my right hand,
<br>35	Until I make thy enemies thy footstool.
<br>36	Therefore let all the house of Israel know most certainly, that God hath made both Lord and Christ, this same Jesus, whom you have cru- cified.
<br>37	Now when they had heard these things, they had compunction in their heart, and said to Peter, and to the rest of the apostles: What shall we do, men and brethren?
<br>38	But Peter said to them: Do penance, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of your sins: and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
<br>39	For the promise is to you, and to your chil- dren, and to all that are far off, whomsoever the Lord our God shall call.
<br>40	And with very many other words did he testify and exhort them, saying: Save yourselves from this perverse generation.
<br>41	They therefore that received his word, were baptized; and there were added in that day
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>about three thousand souls.
<br>42	And they were persevering in the doctrine of the apostles, and in the communication of the breaking of bread, and in prayers.
<br>43	And fear came upon every soul: many won- ders also and signs were done by the apostles in Jerusalem, and there was great fear in all.
<br>44	And all they that believed, were together, and had all things common.
<br>45	Their possessions and goods they sold, and divided them to all, according as every one had need.
<br>46	And continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they took their meat with gladness and simplicity of heart;
<br>47	Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord increased daily to- gether such as should be saved.
<br>
<br>Chapter 3
<br>Now Peter and John went up into the temple at the ninth hour of prayer.
<br>2	And a certain man who was lame from his mother’s womb, was carried: whom they laid ev- ery day at the gate of the temple, which is called Beautiful, that he might ask alms of them that went into the temple.
<br>3	He, when he had seen Peter and John about to go into the temple, asked to receive an alms. 4 But Peter with John fastening his eyes upon
<br>him, said: Look upon us.
<br>5	But he looked earnestly upon them, hoping that he should receive something of them.
<br>6	But Peter said: Silver and gold I have none; but what I have, I give thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, arise, and walk.
<br>7	And taking him by the right hand, he lifted
<br> 
<br>him up, and forthwith his feet and soles received strength.
<br>8	And he leaping up, stood, and walked, and went in with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.
<br>9	And all the people saw him walking and praising God.
<br>10	And they knew him, that it was he who sat begging alms at the Beartiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened to him.
<br>11	And as he held Peter and John, all the people ran to them to the porch which is called Solomon’s, greatly wondering.
<br>12	But Peter seeing, made answer to the peo- ple: Ye men of Israel, why wonder you at this? or why look you upon us, as if by our strength or power we had made this man to walk?
<br>13	The God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus, whom you indeed delivered up and denied before the face of Pilate, when he judged he should be released. 14 But you denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you. 15 But the author of life you killed, whom God hath raised from the dead, of which we are
<br>witnesses.
<br>16	And in the faith of his name, this man, whom you have seen and known, hath his name strengthened; and the faith which is by him, hath given this perfect soundness in the sight of you all.
<br>17	And now, brethren, I know that you did it through ignorance, as did also your rulers.
<br>18	But those things which God before had shewed by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.
<br>19	Be penitent, therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>20	That when the times of refreshment shall come from the presence of the Lord, and he shall send him who hath been preached unto you, Je- sus Christ,
<br>21	Whom heaven indeed must receive, un- til the times of the restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of his holy prophets, from the beginning of the world.
<br>22	For Moses said: A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me: him you shall hear according to all things whatsoever he shall speak to you.
<br>23	And it shall be, that every soul which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.
<br>24	And all the prophets, from Samuel and af- terwards, who have spoken, have told of these days.
<br>25	You are the children of the prophets, and of the testament which God made to our fathers, saying to Abraham: And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.
<br>26	To you first God, raising up his Son, hath sent him to bless you; that every one may convert himself from his wickedness.
<br>
<br>Chapter 4
<br>And as they were speaking to the people, the priests, and the officer of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them,
<br>2	Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached in Jesus the resurrection from the dead:
<br>3	And they laid hands upon them, and put them in hold till the next day; for it was now evening.
<br>4	But many of them who had heard the word, believed; and the number of the men was made
<br> 
<br>five thousand.
<br>5	And it came to pass on the morrow, that their princes, and ancients, and scribes, were gathered together in Jerusalem;
<br>6	And Annas the high priest, and Caiphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest.
<br>7	And setting them in the midst, they asked: By what power, or by what name, have you done this?
<br>8	Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said to them: Ye princes of the people, and ancients, hear:
<br>9	If we this day are examined concerning the good deed done to the infirm man, by what means he hath been made whole:
<br>10	Be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God hath raised from the dead, even by him this man standeth here before you whole.
<br>11	This is the stone which was rejected by you the builders, which is become the head of the corner.
<br>12	Neither is there salvation in any other. For there is no other name under heaven given to men, whereby we must be saved.
<br>13	Now seeing the constancy of Peter and of John, understanding that they were illiter- ate and ignorant men, they wondered; and they knew them that they had been with Jesus.
<br>14	Seeing the man also who had been healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.
<br>15	But they commanded them to go aside out of the council; and they conferred among them- selves,
<br>16	Saying: What shall we do to these men? for indeed a known miracle hath been done by
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>them, to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem: it is manifest, and we cannot deny it.
<br>17	But that it may be no farther spread among the people, let us threaten them that they speak no more in this name to any man.
<br>18	And calling them, they charged them not to speak at all, nor teach in the name of Jesus.
<br>19	But Peter and John answering, said to them: If it be just in the sight of God, to hear you rather than God, judge ye.
<br>20	For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.
<br>21	But they threatening, sent them away, not finding how they might punish them, because of the people; for all men glorified what had been done, in that which had come to pass.
<br>22	For the man was above forty years old, in whom that miraculous cure had been wrought.
<br>23	And being let go, they came to their own company, and related all that the chief priests and ancients had said to them.
<br>24	Who having heard it, with one accord lifted up their voice to God, and said: Lord, thou art he that didst make heaven and earth, the sea, and all things that are in them.
<br>25	Who, by the Holy Ghost, by the mouth of our father David, thy servant, hast said: Why did the Gentiles rage, and the people meditate vain things?
<br>26	The kings of the earth stood up, and the princes assembled together against the Lord and his Christ.
<br>27	For of a truth there assembled together in this city against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel,
<br>28	To do what thy hand and thy counsel de- creed to be done.
<br>29	And now, Lord, behold their threatenings, and grant unto thy servants, that with all confi-
<br> 
<br>dence they may speak thy word,
<br>30	By stretching forth thy hand to cures, and signs, and wonders to be done by the name of thy holy Son Jesus.
<br>31	And when they had prayed, the place was moved wherein they were assembled; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spoke the word of God with confidence.
<br>32	And the multitude of believers had but one heart and one soul: neither did any one say that aught of the things which he possessed, was his own; but all things were common unto them.
<br>33	And with great power did the apostles give testimony of the resurrection of Jesus Christ our Lord; and great grace was in them all.
<br>34	For neither was there any one needy among them. For as many as were owners of lands or houses, sold them, and brought the price of the things they sold,
<br>35	And laid it down before the feet of the apostles. And distribution was made to every one, according as he had need.
<br>36	And Joseph, who, by the apostles, was sur- named Barnabas, (which is, by interpretation, The son of consolation,) a Levite, a Cyprian born,
<br>37	Having land, sold it, and brought the price, and laid it at the feet of the apostles.
<br>
<br>Chapter 5
<br>But a certain man named Ananias, with Saphira his wife, sold a piece of land,
<br>2	And by fraud kept back part of the price of the land, his wife being privy thereunto: and bringing a certain part of it, laid it at the feet of the apostles.
<br>3	But Peter said: Ananias, why hath Satan tempted thy heart, that thou shouldst lie to the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Holy Ghost, and by fraud keep part of the price of the land?
<br>4	Whilst it remained, did it not remain to thee? and after it was sold, was it not in thy power? Why hast thou conceived this thing in thy heart? Thou hast not lied to men, but to God.
<br>5	And Ananias hearing these words, fell down, and gave up the ghost.   And there came great fear upon all that heard it.
<br>6	And the young men rising up, removed him, and carrying him out, buried him.
<br>7	And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what had hap- pened, came in.
<br>8	And Peter said to her: Tell me, woman, whether you sold the land for so much? And she said: Yea, for so much.
<br>9	And Peter said unto her: Why have you agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? Behold the feet of them who have buried thy husband are at the door, and they shall carry thee out.
<br>10	Immediately she fell down before his feet, and gave up the ghost. And the young men com- ing in, found her dead: and carried her out, and buried her by her husband.
<br>11	And there came great fear upon the whole church, and upon all that heard these things.
<br>12	And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people. And they were all with one accord in Solomon’s porch.
<br>13	But of the rest no man durst join himself unto them; but the people magnified them.
<br>14	And the multitude of men and women who believed in the Lord, was more increased:
<br>15	Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that when Peter came, his shadow at
<br> 
<br>the least, might overshadow any of them, and they might be delivered from their infirmities.
<br>16	And there came also together to Jerusalem a multitude out of the neighboring cities, bring- ing sick persons, and such as were troubled with unclean spirits; who were all healed.
<br>17	Then the high prist rising up, and all they that were with him, (which is the heresy of the Sadducees,) were filled with envy.
<br>18	And they laid hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison.
<br>19	But an angel of the Lord by night opening the doors of the prison, and leading them out, said:
<br>20	Go, and standing speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life.
<br>21	Who having heard this, early in the morn- ing, entered into the temple, and taught. And the high priest coming, and they that were with him, called together the council, and all the an- cients of the children of Israel; and they sent to the prison to have them brought.
<br>22	But when the ministers came, and opening the prison, found them not there, they returned and told,
<br>23	Saying: The prison indeed we found shut with all diligence, and the keepers standing be- fore the doors; but opening it, we found no man within.
<br>24	Now when the officer of the temple and the chief priests heard these words, they were in doubt concerning them, what would come to pass.
<br>25	But one came and told them: Behold, the men whom you put in prison are in the temple standing, and teaching the people.
<br>26	Then went the officer with the ministers, and brought them without violence; for they feared the people, lest they should be stoned.
<br>27	And when they had brought them, they
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>set them before the council. And the high priest asked them,
<br>28	Saying: Commanding we commanded you, that you should not teach in this name; and be- hold, you have filled Jerusalem with your doc- trine, and you have a mind to bring the blood of this man upon us.
<br>29	But Peter and the apostles answering, said: We ought to obey God, rather than men.
<br>30	The God of our fathers hath raised up Je- sus, whom you put to death, hanging him upon a tree.
<br>31	Him hath God exalted with his right hand, to be Prince and Saviour, to give repentance to Israel, and remission of sins.
<br>32	And we are witnesses of these things and the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to all that obey him.
<br>33	When they had heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they thought to put them to death.
<br>34	But one in the council rising up, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, respected by all the people, commanded the men to be put forth a little while.
<br>35	And he said to them: Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what you intend to do, as touching these men.
<br>36	For before these days rose up Theodas, af- firming himself to be somebody, to whom a num- ber of men, about four hundred, joined them- selves: who was slain; and all that believed him were scattered, and brought to nothing.
<br>37	After this man, rose up Judas of Galilee, in the days of the enrolling, and drew away the people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as consented to him, were dispersed.
<br>38	And now, therefore, I say to you, refrain from these men, and let them alone; for if this council or this work be of men, it will come to
<br> 
<br>nought;
<br>39	But if it be of God, you cannot overthrow it, lest perhaps you be found even to fight against God. And they consented to him.
<br>40	And calling in the apostles, after they had scourged them, they charged them that they should not speak at all in the name of Jesus; and they dismissed them.
<br>41	And they indeed went from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were accounted worthy to suffer reproach for the name of Jesus.
<br>42	And every day they ceased not in the temple, and from house to house, to teach and preach Christ Jesus.
<br>
<br>Chapter 6
<br>And in those days, the number of the disciples in- creasing, there arose a murmuring of the Greeks against the Hebrews, for that their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.
<br>2	Then the twelve calling together the multi- tude of the disciples, said: It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve ta- bles.
<br>3	Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of good reputation, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.
<br>4	But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.
<br>5	And the saying was liked by all the mul- titude. And they chose Stephen, a man full of faith, and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Par- menas, and Nicolas, a proselyte of Antioch.
<br>6	These they set before the apostles; and they praying, imposed hands upon them.
<br>7	And the word of the Lord increased; and
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>the number of the disciples was multiplied in Jerusalem exceedingly: a great multitude also of the priests obeyed the faith.
<br>8	And Stephen, full of grace and fortitude, did great wonders and signs among the people.
<br>9	Now there arose some of that which is called the synagogue of the Libertines, and of the Cyre- nians, and of the Alexandrians, and of them that were of Cilicia and Asia, disputing with Stephen. 10 And they were not able to resist the wis-
<br>dom and the spirit that spoke.
<br>11	Then they suborned men to say, they had heard him speak words of blasphemy against Moses and against God.
<br>12	And they stirred up the people, and the ancients, and the scribes; and running together, they took him, and brought him to the council. 13 And they set up false witnesses, who said:
<br>This man ceaseth not to speak words against the holy place and the law.
<br>14	For we have heard him say, that this Je- sus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the traditions which Moses deliv- ered unto us.
<br>15	And all that sat in the council, looking on him, saw his face as if it had been the face of an angel.
<br>
<br>Chapter 7
<br>Then the high priest said: Are these things so?
<br>2	Who said: Ye men, brethren, and fathers, hear. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charan.
<br>3	And said to him: Go forth out of thy coun- try, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall shew thee.
<br>4	Then   he   went   out   of   the   land   of   the
<br> 
<br>Chaldeans, and dwelt in Charan. And from thence, after his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein you now dwell.
<br>5	And he gave him no inheritance in it; no, not the pace of a foot: but he promised to give it him in possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child.
<br>6	And God said to him: That his seed should sojourn in a strange country, and that they should bring them under bondage, and treat them evil four hundred years.
<br>7	And the nation which they shall serve will I judge, said the Lord; and after these things they shall go out, and shall serve me in this place.
<br>8	And he gave him the covenant of circum- cision, and so he begot Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac begot Jacob; and Jacob the twelve patriarchs.
<br>9	And the patriarchs, through envy, sold Joseph into Egypt; and God was with him,
<br>10	And delivered him out of all his tribula- tions: and he gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharao, the king of Egypt; and he appointed him governor over Egypt, and over all his house.
<br>11	Now there came a famine upon all Egypt and Chanaan, and great tribulation; and our fa- thers found no food.
<br>12	But when Jacob had heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent our fathers first:
<br>13	And at the second time, Joseph was known by his brethren, and his kindred was made known to Pharao.
<br>14	And Joseph sending, called thither Jacob, his father, and all his kindred, seventy-five souls. 15 So  Jacob went  down into  Egypt; and he
<br>died, and our fathers.
<br>16	And they were translated into Sichem, and were laid in the sepulchre, that Abraham bought
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>for a sum of money of the sons of Hemor, the son of Sichem.
<br>17	And when the time of the promise drew near, which God had promised to Abraham, the people increased, and were multiplied in Egypt, 18 Till another king arose in Egypt, who knew
<br>not Joseph.
<br>19 This same dealing craftily with our race, af- flicted our fathers, that they should expose their children, to the end they might not be kept alive. 20 At the same time was Moses born, and he was acceptable to God: who was nourished three
<br>months in his father’s house.
<br>21	And when he was exposed, Pharao’s daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son.
<br>22	And Moses was instructed in all the wis- dom of the Egyptians; and he was mighty in his words and in his deeds.
<br>23	And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren, the chil- dren of Israel.
<br>24	And when he had seen one of them suffer wrong, he defended him; and striking the Egyp- tian, he avenged him who suffered the injury.
<br>25	And he thought that his brethren under- stood that God by his hand would save them; but they understood it not.
<br>26	And the day following, he shewed himself to them when they were at strife; and would have reconciled them in peace, saying: Men, ye are brethren; why hurt you one another?
<br>27	But he that did the injury to his neighbour thrust him away, saying: Who hath appointed thee prince and judge over us?
<br>28	What, wilt thou kill me, as thou didst yes- terday kill the Egyptian?
<br>29	And Moses fled upon this word, and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begot two sons.
<br> 
<br>30	And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the desert of mount Sina, an angel in a flame of fire in a bush.
<br>31	And Moses seeing it, wondered at the sight. And as he drew near to view it, the voice of the Lord came unto him, saying:
<br>32	I am the God of thy fathers; the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Ja- cob. And Moses being terrified, durst not be- hold.
<br>33	And the Lord said to him: Loose the shoes from thy feet, for the place wherein thou stand- est, is holy ground.
<br>34	Seeing I have seen the affliction of my peo- ple which is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, and I will send thee into Egypt. 35 This Moses, whom they refused, saying: Who hath appointed thee prince and judge? him God sent to be prince and redeemer by the hand
<br>of the angel who appeared to him in the bush.
<br>36	He brought them out, doing wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red Sea, and in the desert forty years.
<br>37	This is that Moses who said to the children of Israel: A prophet shall God raise up to you of your own brethren, as myself: him shall you hear.
<br>38	This is he that was in the church in the wilderness, with the angel who spoke to him on mount Sina, and with our fathers; who received the words of life to give unto us.
<br>39	Whom our fathers would not obey; but thrust him away, and in their hearts turned back into Egypt,
<br>40	Saying to Aaron: Make us gods to go before us. For as for this Moses, who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.
<br>41	And they made a calf in those days, and
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>offered sacrifices to the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.
<br>42	And God turned, and gave them up to serve the host of heaven, as it is written in the books of the prophets: Did you offer victims and sacrifices to me for forty years, in the desert, O house of Israel?
<br>43	And you took unto you the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Rempham, fig- ures which you made to adore them. And I will carry you away beyond Babylon.
<br>44	The tabernacle of the testimony was with our fathers in the desert, as God ordained for them, speaking to Moses, that he should make it according to the form which he had seen.
<br>45	Which also our fathers receiving, brought in with Jesus, into the possession of the Gen- tiles, whom God drove out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David.
<br>46	Who found grace before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob.
<br>47	But Solomon built him a house.
<br>48	Yet the most High dwelleth not in houses made by hands, as the prophet saith:
<br>49	Heaven is my throne, and the earth my footstool. What house will you build me? saith the Lord; or what is the place of my resting?
<br>50	Hath not my hand made all these things? 51 You stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Ghost: as
<br>your fathers did, so do you also.
<br>52 Which of the prophets have not your fa- thers persecuted? And they have slain them who foretold of the coming of the Just One; of whom you have been now the betrayers and murderers: 53 Who have received the law by the disposi-
<br>tion of angels, and have not kept it.
<br>54 Now hearing these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed with their teeth at him.
<br> 
<br>55	But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, look- ing up steadfastly to heaven, saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God. And he said: Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.
<br>56	And they crying out with a loud voice, stopped their ears, and with one accord ran vio- lently upon him.
<br>57	And casting him forth without the city, they stoned him; and the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man, whose name was Saul.
<br>58	And they stoned Stephen, invoking, and saying: Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.
<br>59	And falling on his knees, he cried with a loud voice, saying: Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep in the Lord. And Saul was consenting to his death.
<br>
<br>Chapter 8
<br>And at that time there was raised a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all dispersed through the countries of Judea, and Samaria, except the apostles.
<br>2	And devout men took order for Stephen’s funeral, and made great mourning over him.
<br>3	But Saul made havock of the church, enter- ing in from house to house, and dragging away men and women, committed them to prison.
<br>4	They therefore that were dispersed, went about preaching the word of God.
<br>5	And Philip going down to the city of Samaria, preached Christ unto them.
<br>6	And the people with one accord were atten- tive to those things which were said by Philip,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>hearing, and seeing the miracles which he did.
<br>7	For many of them who had unclean spirits, crying with a loud voice, went out.
<br>8	And many, taken with the palsy, and that were lame, were healed.
<br>9	There was therefore great joy in that city. Now there was a certain man named Simon, who before had been a magician in that city, seducing the people of Samaria, giving out that he was some great one:
<br>10	To whom they all gave ear, from the least to the greatest, saying: This man is the power of God, which is called great.
<br>11	And they were attentive to him, because, for a long time, he had bewitched them with his magical practices.
<br>12	But when they had believed Philip preach- ing of the kingdom of God, in the name of Je- sus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.
<br>13	Then Simon himself believed also; and be- ing baptized, he adhered to Philip. And being astonished, wondered to see the signs and ex- ceeding great miracles which were done.
<br>14	Now when the apostles, who were in Jerusalem, had heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John.
<br>15	Who, when they were come, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost.
<br>16	For he was not as yet come upon any of them; but they were only baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
<br>17	Then they laid their hands upon them, and they received the Holy Ghost.
<br>18	And when Simon saw, that by the imposi- tion of the hands of the apostles, the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,
<br>19	Saying: Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I shall lay my hands, he may receive
<br> 
<br>the Holy Ghost. But Peter said to him:
<br>20	Keep thy money to thyself, to perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.
<br>21	Thou hast no part nor lot in this matter.
<br>For thy heart is not right in the sight of God.
<br>22	Do penance therefore for this thy wicked- ness; and pray to God, that perhaps this thought of thy heart may be forgiven thee.
<br>23	For I see thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bonds of iniquity.
<br>24	Then Simon answering, said: Pray you for me to the Lord, that none of these things which you have spoken may come upon me.
<br>25	And they indeed having testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel to many countries of the Samaritans.
<br>26	Now an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying: Arise, go towards the south, to the way that goeth down from Jerusalem into Gaza: this is desert.
<br>27	And rising up, he went. And behold a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch, of great authority un- der Candace the queen of the Ethiopians, who had charge over all her treasures, had come to Jerusalem to adore.
<br>28	And he was returning, sitting in this char- iot, and reading Isaias the prophet.
<br>29	And the Spirit said to Philip: Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.
<br>30	And Philip running thither, heard him reading the prophet Isaias. And he said: Think- est thou that thou understandest what thou readest?
<br>31	Who said: And how can I, unless some man shew me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.
<br>32	And the place of the scripture which he was reading was this: He was led as a sheep to the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>slaughter; and like a lamb without voice before his shearer, so openeth he not his mouth.
<br>33	In humility his judgment was taken away. His generation who shall declare, for his life shall be taken from the earth?
<br>34	And the eunuch answering Philip, said: I beseech thee, of whom doth the prophet speak this? of himself, or of some other man?
<br>35	Then Philip, opening his mouth, and be- ginning at this scripture, preached unto him Je- sus.
<br>36	And as they went on their way, they came to a certain water; and the eunuch said: See, here is water: what doth hinder me from being baptized?
<br>37	And Philip said: If thou believest with all thy heart, thou mayest. And he answering, said: I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.
<br>38	And he commanded the chariot to stand still; and they went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch: and he baptized him.
<br>39	And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord took away Philip; and the eunuch saw him no more. And he went on his way rejoicing.
<br>40	But Philip was found in Azotus; and pass- ing through, he preached the gospel to all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.
<br>
<br>Chapter 9
<br>And Saul, as yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest,
<br>2	And asked of him letters to Damascus, to the synagogues: that if he found any men and wemen of this way, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.
<br>3	And as he went on his journey, it came to
<br> 
<br>pass that he drew nigh to Damascus; and sud- denly a light from heaven shined round about him.
<br>4	And falling on the ground, he heard a voice saying to him: Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
<br>5	Who said: Who art thou, Lord? And he: I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. It is hard for thee to kick against the goad.
<br>6	And he trembling and astonished, said: Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?
<br>7	And the Lord said to him: Arise, and go into the city, and there it shall be told thee what thou must do. Now the men who went in company with him, stood amazed, hearing indeed a voice, but seeing no man.
<br>8	And Saul arose from the ground; and when his eyes were opened, he saw nothing. But they leading him by the hands, brought him to Dam- ascus.
<br>9	And he was there three days, without sight, and he did neither eat nor drink.
<br>10	Now there was a certain disciple at Damas- cus, named Ananias. And the Lord said to him in a vision: Ananias. And he said: Behold I am here, Lord.
<br>11	And the Lord said to him: Arise, and go into the street that is called Stait, and seek in the house of Judas, one named Saul of Tarsus. For behold he prayeth.
<br>12	(And he saw a man named Ananias com- ing in, and putting his hands upon him, that he might receive his sight.)
<br>13	But Ananias answered: Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints in Jerusalem.
<br>14	And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that invoke thy name.
<br>15	And the Lord said to him: Go thy way; for this man is to me a vessel of election, to carry
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel.
<br>16	For I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name’s sake.
<br>17	And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house. And laying his hands upon him, he said: Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus hath sent me, he that appeared to thee in the way as thou camest; that thou mayest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.
<br>18	And immediately there fell from his eyes as it were scales, and he received his sight; and rising up, he was baptized.
<br>19	And when he had taken meat, he was strengthened. And he was with the disciples that were at Damascus, for some days.
<br>20	And immediately he preached Jesus in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.
<br>21	And all that heard him, were astonished, and said: Is not this he who persecuted in Jerusalem those that called upon this name: and came hither for that intent, that he might carry them bound to the chief priests?
<br>22	But Saul increased much more in strength, and confounded the Jews who dwelt at Damas- cus, affirming that this is the Christ.
<br>23	And when many days were passed, the Jews consulted together to kill him.
<br>24	But their laying in wait was made known to Saul.   And they watched the gates also day and night, that they might kill him.
<br>25	But the disciples taking him in the night, conveyed him away by the wall, letting him down in a basket.
<br>26	And when he was come into Jerusalem, he essayed to join himself to the disciples; and they all were afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.
<br>27	But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and told them how he had seen
<br> 
<br>the Lord, and that he had spoken to him; and how in Damascus he had dealt confidently in the name of Jesus.
<br>28	And he was with them coming in and going out in Jerusalem, and dealing confidently in the name of the Lord.
<br>29	He spoke also to the Gentiles, and disputed with the Greeks; but they sought to kill him.
<br>30	Which when the brethren had known, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him away to Tarsus.
<br>31	Now the church had peace throughout all Judea, and Galilee, and Samaria; and was ed- ified, walking in the fear of the Lord, and was filled with the consolation of the Holy Ghost.
<br>32	And it came to pass that Peter, as he passed through, visiting all, came to the saints who dwelt at Lydda.
<br>33	And he found there a certain man named Eneas, who had kept his bed for eight years, who was ill of the palsy.
<br>34	And Peter said to him: Eneas, the Lord Jesus Christ healeth thee: arise, and make thy bed. And immediately he arose.
<br>35	And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron, saw him: who were converted to the Lord.
<br>36	And in Joppe there was a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas. This woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did.
<br>37	And it came to pass in those days that she was sick, and died. Whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper chamber.
<br>38	And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppe, the disciples hearing that Peter was there, sent unto him two men, desiring him that he would not be slack to come unto them.
<br>39	And Peter rising up, went with them. And when he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber. And all the widows stood about
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>him weeping, and shewing him the coats and gar- ments which Dorcas made them.
<br>40	And they all being put forth, Peter kneel- ing down prayed, and turning to the body, he said: Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes; and seeing Peter, she sat up.
<br>41	And giving her his hand, he lifted her up. And when he had called the saints and the wid- ows, he presented her alive.
<br>42	And it was made known throughout all Joppe; and many believed in the Lord.
<br>43	And it came to pass, that he abode many days in Joppe, with one Simon a tanner.
<br>
<br>Chapter 10
<br>
<br>And there was a certain man in Caesarea, named Cornelius, a centurion of that which is called the Italian band;
<br>2	A religious man, and fearing God with all his house, giving much alms to the people, and always praying to God.
<br>3	This man saw in a vision manifestly, about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God com- ing in unto him, and saying to him: Cornelius.
<br>4	And he, beholding him, being seized with fear, said: What is it, Lord? And he said to him: Thy prayers and thy alms are ascended for a memorial in the sight of God.
<br>5	And now send men to Joppe, and call hither one Simon, who is surnamed Peter:
<br>6	He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side. He will tell thee what thou must do.
<br>7	And when the angel who spoke to him was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a soldier who feared the Lord, of them that were under him.
<br> 
<br>8	To whom when he had related all, he sent them to Joppe.
<br>9	And on the next day, whilst they were going on their journey, and drawing nigh to the city, Peter went up to the higher parts of the house to pray, about the sixth hour.
<br>10	And being hungry, he was desirous to taste somewhat. And as they were preparing, there came upon him an ecstasy of mind.
<br>11	And he saw the heaven opened, and a cer- tain vessel descending, as it were a great linen sheet let down by the four corners from heaven to the earth:
<br>12	Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts, and creeping things of the earth, and fowls of the air.
<br>13	And there came a voice to him: Arise, Pe- ter; kill and eat.
<br>14	But Peter said: Far be it from me; for I never did eat any thing that is common and un- clean.
<br>15	And the voice spoke to him again the sec- ond time: That which God hath cleansed, do not thou call common.
<br>16	And this was done thrice; and presently the vessel was taken up into heaven.
<br>17	Now, whilst Peter was doubting within himself, what the vision that he had seen should mean, behold the men who were sent from Cor- nelius, inquiring for Simon’s house, stood at the gate.
<br>18	And when they had called,   they asked, if Simon, who is surnamed Peter, were lodged there.
<br>19	And as Peter was thinking of the vision, the Spirit said to him: Behold three men seek thee.
<br>20	Arise, therefore, get thee down and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>21	Then Peter, going down to the men, said: Behold, I am he whom you seek; what is the cause for which you are come?
<br>22	Who said: Cornelius, a centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and having good testimony from all the nation of the Jews, re- ceived an answer of an holy angel, to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee.
<br>23	Then bringing them in, he lodged them. And the day following he arose, and went with them: and some of the brethren from Joppe ac- companied him.
<br>24	And the morrow after, he entered into Cae- sarea. And Cornelius waited for them, having called together his kinsmen and special friends. 25 And it came to pass, that when Peter was come in, Cornelius came to meet him, Cornelius came to meet him, and falling at his feet adored. 26 But  Peter lifted him up, saying: Arise, I
<br>myself also am a man.
<br>27	And talking with him, he went in, and found many that were come together.
<br>28	And he said to them: You know how abom- inable it is for a man that is a Jew, to keep com- pany or to come unto one of another nation: but God hath shewed to me, to call no man common or unclean.
<br>29	For which cause, making no doubt, I came when I was sent for. I ask, therefore, for what cause you have sent for me?
<br>30	And Cornelius said: Four days ago, unto this hour, I was praying in my house, at the ninth hour, and behold a man stood before me in white apparel, and said:
<br>31	Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thy alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God. 32 Send therefore to Joppe, and call hither Simon, who is surnamed Peter: he lodgeth in
<br>the house of Simon a tanner, by the sea side.
<br>33	Immediately therefore I sent to thee: and
<br> 
<br>thou hast done well in coming.   Now therefore all we are present in thy sight, to hear all things whatsoever are commanded thee by the Lord.
<br>34	And Peter opening his mouth, said: In very deed I perceive, that God is not a respecter of persons.
<br>35	But in every nation, he that feareth him, and worketh justice, is acceptable to him.
<br>36	God sent the word to the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all.)
<br>37	You know the word which hath been pub- lished through all Judea:	for it began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached, 38 Jesus of Nazareth: how God anointed him with the Holy Ghost, and with power, who went about doing good, and healing all that were op-
<br>pressed by the devil, for God was with him.
<br>39	And we are witnesses of all things that he did in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem, whom they killed, hanging him upon a tree.
<br>40	Him God raised up the third day, and gave him to be made manifest,
<br>41	Not to all the people, but to witnesses pre- ordained by God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he arose again from the dead;
<br>42	And he commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify that it is he who was ap- pointed by God, to be judge of the living and of the dead.
<br>43	To him all the prophets give testimony, that by his name all receive remission of sins, who believe in him.
<br>44	While Peter was yet speaking these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them that heard the word.
<br>45	And the faithful of the circumcision, who came with Peter, were astonished, for that the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>grace of the Holy Ghost was poured out upon the Gentiles also.
<br>46	For they heard them speaking with tongues, and magnifying God.
<br>47	Then Peter answered: Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, who have received the Holy Ghost, as well as we?
<br>48	And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Then they desired him to tarry with them some days.
<br>
<br>Chapter 11
<br>And the apostles and brethren, who were in Judea, heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.
<br>2	And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him,
<br>3	Saying: Why didst thou go in to men uncir- cumcised, and didst eat with them?
<br>4	But Peter began and declared to them the matter in order, saying:
<br>5	I was in the city of Joppe praying, and I saw in an ecstasy of mind a vision, a certain vessel descending, as it were a great sheet let down from heaven by four corners, and it came even unto me.
<br>6	Into which looking, I considered, and saw fourfooted creatures of the earth, and beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air:
<br>7	And I heard also a voice saying to me: Arise, Peter; kill and eat.
<br>8	And I said: Not so, Lord; for nothing common or unclean hath ever entered into my mouth.
<br>9	And the voice answered again from heaven: What God hath made clean, do not thou call common.
<br> 
<br>10	And this was done three times: and all were taken up again into heaven.
<br>11	And behold, immediately there were three men come to the house wherein I was, sent to me from Caesarea.
<br>12	And the Spirit said to me, that I should go with them, nothing doubting. And these six brethren went with me also: and we entered into the man’s house.
<br>13	And he told us how he had seen an angel in his house, standing, and saying to him: Send to Joppe, and call hither Simon, who is surnamed Peter,
<br>14	Who shall speak to thee words, whereby thou shalt be saved, and all thy house.
<br>15	And when I had begun to speak, the Holy Ghost fell upon them, as upon us also in the beginning.
<br>16	And I remembered the word of the Lord, how that he said: John indeed baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost.
<br>17	If then God gave them the same grace, as to us also who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ; who was I, that could withstand God?
<br>18	Having heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying: God then hath also to the Gentiles given repentance unto life.
<br>19	Now they who had been dispersed by the persecution that arose on occasion of Stephen, went about as far as Phenice and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to none, but to the Jews only.
<br>20	But some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they were entered into An- tioch, spoke also to the Greeks, preaching the Lord Jesus.
<br>21	And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believing, were converted to the Lord.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>22	And the tidings came to the ears of the church that was at Jerusalem, touching these things: and they sent Barnabas as far as An- tioch.
<br>23	Who, when he was come, and had seen the grace of God, rejoiced: and he exhorted them all with purpose of heart to continue in the Lord.
<br>24	For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith. And a great multitude was added to the Lord.
<br>25	And Barnabas went to Tarsus to seek Saul: whom, when he had found, he brought to Anti- och.
<br>26	And they conversed there in the church a whole year; and they taught a great multitude, so that at Antioch the disciples were first named Christians.
<br>27	And in these days there came prophets from Jerusalem to Antioch:
<br>28	And one of them named Agabus, rising up, signified by the Spirit, that there should be a great famine over the whole world, which came to pass under Claudius.
<br>29	And the disciples, every man according to his ability, purposed to send relief to the brethren who dwelt in Judea:
<br>30	Which also they did, sending it to the an- cients, by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.
<br>
<br>Chapter 12
<br>And at the same time, Herod the king stretched forth his hands, to afflict some of the church.
<br>2	And he killed James, the brother of John, with the sword.
<br>3	And seeing that it pleased the Jews, he pro- ceeded to take up Peter also. Now it was in the days of the Azymes.
<br>4	And when he had apprehended him, he cast
<br> 
<br>him into prison, delivering him to four files of soldiers to be kept, intending, after the pasch, to bring him forth to the people.
<br>5	Peter therefore was kept in prison. But prayer was made without ceasing by the church unto God for him.
<br>6	And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison.
<br>7	And behold an angel of the Lord stood by him: and a light shined in the room: and he striking Peter on the side, raised him up, saying: Arise quickly. And the chains fell off from his hands.
<br>8	And the angel said to him: Gird thyself, and put on thy sandals. And he did so. And he said to him: Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me.
<br>9	And going out, he followed him, and he knew not that it was true which was done by the angel: but thought he saw a vision.
<br>10	And passing through the first and the sec- ond ward, they came to the iron gate that lead- eth to the city, which of itself opened to them. And going out, they passed on through one street: and immediately the angel departed from him.
<br>11	And Peter coming to himself, said: Now I know in very deed, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.
<br>12	And considering, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, who was surnamed Mark, where many were gathered together and praying.
<br>13	And when he knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken, whose name was Rhode.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>14	And as soon as she knew Peter’s voice, she opened not the gate for joy, but running in she told that Peter stood before the gate.
<br>15	But they said to her: Thou art mad. But she affirmed that it was so. Then said they: It is his angel.
<br>16	But Peter continued knocking. And when they had opened, they saw him, and were aston- ished.
<br>17	But he beckoning to them with his hand to hold their peace, told how the Lord had brought him out of prison, and he said: Tell these things to James, and to the brethren. And going out, he went into another place.
<br>18	Now when day was come, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter.
<br>19	And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not; having examined the keepers, he commanded they should be put to death; and going down from Judea to Caesarea, he abode there.
<br>20	And he was angry with the Tyrians and the Sidonians. But they with one accord came to him, and having gained Blastus, who was the king’s chamberlain, they desired peace, because their countries were nourished by him.
<br>21	And upon a day appointed, Herod being arrayed in kingly apparel, sat in the judgment seat, and made an oration to them.
<br>22	And the people made acclamation, saying: It is the voice of a god, and not of a man.
<br>23	And forthwith an angel of the Lord struck him, because he had not given the honour to God: and being eaten up by worms, he gave up the ghost.
<br>24	But the word of the Lord increased and multiplied.
<br>25	And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, having fulfilled their ministry, taking
<br> 
<br>with them John, who was surnamed Mark.
<br>
<br>Chapter 13
<br>Now there were in the church which was at An- tioch, prophets and doctors, among whom was Barnabas, and Simon who was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manahen, who was the foster brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
<br>2	And as they were ministering to the Lord, and fasting, the Holy Ghost said to them: Sepa- rate me Saul and Barnabas, for the work where- unto I have taken them.
<br>3	Then they, fasting and praying, and impos- ing their hands upon them, sent them away.
<br>4	So they being sent by the Holy Ghost, went to Seleucia: and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.
<br>5	And when they were come to Salamina, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. And they had John also in the min- istry.
<br>6	And when they had gone through the whole island, as far as Paphos, they found a certain man, a magician, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bar-jesu:
<br>7	Who was with the proconsul Sergius Paulus, a prudent man. He sending for Barnabas and Saul, desired to hear the word of God.
<br>8	But Elymas the magician (for so his name is interpreted) withstood them, seeking to turn away the proconsul from the faith.
<br>9	Then Saul, otherwise Paul, filled with the Holy Ghost, looking upon him,
<br>10	Said: O full of all guile, and of all deceit, child of the devil, enemy of all justice, thou ceas- est not to pervert the right ways of the Lord.
<br>11	And now behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>the sun for a time. And immediately there fell a mist and darkness upon him, and going about, he sought some one to lead him by the hand.
<br>12	Then the proconsul, when he had seen what was done, believed, admiring at the doc- trine of the Lord.
<br>13	Now when Paul and they that were with him had sailed from Paphos, they came to Perge in Pamphylia. And John departing from them, returned to Jerusalem.
<br>14	But they passing through Perge, came to Antioch in Pisidia: and entering into the syna- gogue on the sabbath day, they sat down.
<br>15	And after the reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying: Ye men, brethren, if you have any word of exhortation to make to the people, speak.
<br>16	Then Paul rising up, and with his hand bespeaking silence, said: Ye men of Israel, and you that fear God, give ear.
<br>17	The God of the people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they were sojourners in the land of Egypt, and with an high arm brought them out from thence,
<br>18	And for the space of forty years endured their manners in the desert.
<br>19	And destroying seven nations in the land of Chanaan, divided their land among them, by lot,
<br>20	As it were, after four hundred and fifty years: and after these things, he gave unto them judges, until Samuel the prophet.
<br>21	And after that they desired a king: and God gave them Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, forty years.
<br>22	And when he had removed him, he raised them up David to be king: to whom giving tes- timony, he said: I have found David, the son of Jesse, a man according to my own heart, who
<br> 
<br>shall do all my wills.
<br>23	Of this man’s seed God according to his promise, hath raised up to Israel a Saviour, Je- sus:
<br>24	John first preaching, before his coming, the baptism of penance to all the people of Israel.
<br>25	And when John was fulfilling his course, he said: I am not he, whom you think me to be: but behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to loose.
<br>26	Men, brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever among you fear God, to you the word of this salvation is sent.
<br>27	For they that inhabited Jerusalem, and the rulers thereof, not knowing him, nor the voices of the prophets, which are read every sabbath, judging him have fulfilled them.
<br>28	And finding no cause of death in him, they desired of Pilate, that they might kill him.
<br>29	And when they had fulfilled all things that were written of him, taking him down from the tree, they laid him in a sepulchre.
<br>30	But God raised him up from the dead the third day:
<br>31	Who was seen for many days, by them who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who to this present are his witnesses to the peo- ple.
<br>32	And we declare unto you, that the promise which was made to our fathers,
<br>33	This same God hath fulfilled to our chil- dren, raising up Jesus, as in the second psalm also is written: Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.
<br>34	And to shew that he raised him up from the dead, not to return now any more to corruption, he said thus: I will give you the holy things of David faithful.
<br>35	And therefore, in another place also, he saith: Thou shalt not suffer thy holy one to see
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>corruption.
<br>36	For David, when he had served in his gen- eration, according to the will of God, slept: and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption.
<br>37	But he whom God hath raised from the dead, saw no corruption.
<br>38	Be it known therefore to you, men, brethren, that through him forgiveness of sins is preached to you: and from all the things, from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses.
<br>39	In him every one that believeth, is justified.
<br>40	Beware, therefore, lest that come upon you which is spoken in the prophets:
<br>41	Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and per- ish: for I work a work in your days, a work which you will not believe, if any man shall tell it you. 42 And as they went out, they desired them, that on the next sabbath, they would speak unto
<br>them these words.
<br>43	And when the synagogue was broken up, many of the Jews, and of the strangers who served God, followed Paul and Barnabas: who speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.
<br>44	But the next sabbath day, the whole city almost came together, to hear the word of God. 45 And the Jews seeing the multitudes, were filled with envy, and contradicted those things
<br>which were said by Paul, blaspheming.
<br>46	Then Paul and Barnabas said boldly: To you it behoved us first to speak the word of God: but because you reject it, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold we turn to the Gentiles.
<br>47	For so the Lord hath commanded us: I have set thee to be the light of the Gentiles; that thou mayest be for salvation unto the utmost part of the earth.
<br> 
<br>48	And the Gentiles hearing it, were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to life everlasting, believed.
<br>49	And the word of the Lord was published throughout the whole country.
<br>50	But the Jews stirred up religious and hon- ourable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barn- abas: and cast them out of their coasts.
<br>51	But they, shaking off the dust of their feet against them, came to Iconium.
<br>52	And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Ghost.
<br>
<br>Chapter 14
<br>And it came to pass in Iconium, that they en- tered together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spoke that a very great multitude both of the Jews and of the Greeks did believe.
<br>2	But the unbelieving Jews stirred up and incensed the minds of the Gentiles against the brethren.
<br>3	A long time therefore they abode there, deal- ing confidently in the Lord, who gave testimony to the word of his grace, granting signs and won- ders to be done by their hands.
<br>4	And the multitude of the city was divided; and some of them indeed held with the Jews, but some with the apostles.
<br>5	And when there was an assault made by the Gentiles and the Jews with their rulers, to use them contumeliously, and to stone them:
<br>6	They understanding it, fled to Lystra, and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and to the whole coun- try round about, and were there preaching the gospel.
<br>7	And there sat a certain man at Lystra, im- potent in his feet, a cripple from his mother’s
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>womb, who never had walked.
<br>8	This same heard Paul speaking. Who look- ing upon him, and seeing that he had faith to be healed,
<br>9	Said with a loud voice: Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped up, and walked.
<br>10	And when the multitudes had seen what Paul had done, they lifted up their voice in the Lycaonian tongue, saying: The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men;
<br>11	And they called Barnabas, Jupiter: but Paul, Mercury; because he was chief speaker.
<br>12	The priest also of Jupiter that was before the city, bringing oxen and garlands before the gate, would have offered sacrifice with the peo- ple.
<br>13	Which, when the apostles Barnabas and Paul had heard, rending their clothes, they leaped out among the people, crying,
<br>14	And saying: Ye men, why do ye these things? We also are mortals, men like unto you, preaching to you to be converted from these vain things, to the living God, who made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all things that are in them:
<br>15	Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways.
<br>16	Nevertheless he left not himself without testimony, doing good from heaven, giving rains and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.
<br>17	And speaking these things, they scarce re- strained the people from sacrificing to them.
<br>18	Now there came thither certain Jews from Antioch, and Iconium: and persuading the mul- titude, and stoning Paul, drew him out of the city, thinking him to be dead.
<br>19	But as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up and entered into the city, and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.
<br> 
<br>20	And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and to Antioch: 21 Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith: and that through many tribulations we must enter into
<br>the kingdom of God.
<br>22	And when they had ordained to them priests in every church, and had prayed with fast- ing, they commended them to the Lord, in whom they believed.
<br>23	And passing through Pisidia, they came into Pamphylia.
<br>24	And having spoken the word of the Lord in Perge, they went down into Attalia:
<br>25	And thence they sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been delivered to the grace of God, unto the work which they accomplished.
<br>26	And when they were come, and had as- sembled the church, they related what great things God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.
<br>27	And they abode no small time with the disciples.
<br>
<br>Chapter 15
<br>And some coming down from Judea, taught the brethren: That except you be circumcised after the manner of Moses, you cannot be saved.
<br>2	And when Paul and Barnabas had no small contest with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain others of the other side, should go up to the apostles and priests to Jerusalem about this question.
<br>3	They therefore being brought on their way by the church, passed through Phenice, and Samaria, relating the conversion of the Gentiles; and they caused great joy to all the brethren.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>4	And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received by the church, and by the apostles and ancients, declaring how great things God had done with them.
<br>5	But there arose some of the sect of the Phar- isees that believed, saying: They must be cir- cumcised, and be commanded to observe the law of Moses.
<br>6	And the apostles and ancients assembled to consider of this matter.
<br>7	And when there had been much disputing, Peter, rising up, said to them: Men, brethren, you know, that in former days God made choice among us, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.
<br>8	And God, who knoweth the hearts, gave tes- timony, giving unto them the Holy Ghost, as well as to us;
<br>9	And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.
<br>10	Now therefore, why tempt you God to put a yoke upon the necks of the disciples, which nei- ther our fathers nor we have been able to bear? 11 But by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, we believe to be saved, in like manner as they
<br>also.
<br>12	And all the multitude held their peace; and they heard Barnabas and Paul telling what great signs and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them.
<br>13	And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying: Men, brethren, hear me.
<br>14	Simon hath related how God first visited to take of the Gentiles a people to his name.
<br>15	And to this agree the words of the prophets, as it is written:
<br>16	After these things I will return, and will rebuild the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and the ruins thereof I will rebuild, and I will set it up:
<br> 
<br>17	That the residue of men may seek after the Lord, and all nations upon whom my name is invoked, saith the Lord, who doth these things. 18 To the Lord was his own work known from
<br>the beginning of the world.
<br>19	For which cause I judge that they, who from among the Gentiles are converted to God, are not to be disquieted.
<br>20	But that we write unto them, that they refrain themselves from the pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood.
<br>21	For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him in the synagogues, where he is read every sabbath.
<br>22	Then it pleased the apostles and ancients, with the whole church, to choose men of their own company, and to send to Antioch, with Paul and Barnabas, namely, Judas, who was sur- named Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren.
<br>23	Writing by their hands: The apostles and ancients, brethren, to the brethren of the Gen- tiles that are at Antioch, and in Syria and Cilicia, greeting.
<br>24	Forasmuch as we have heard, that some go- ing out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls; to whom we gave no com- mandment:
<br>25	It hath seemed good to us, being assembled together, to choose out men, and to send them unto you, with our well beloved Barnabas and Paul:
<br>26	Men that have given their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
<br>27	We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who themselves also will, by word of mouth, tell you the same things.
<br>28	For it hath seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us, to lay no further burden upon you
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>than these necessary things:
<br>29	That you abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication; from which things keeping yourselves, you shall do well. Fare ye well.
<br>30	They therefore being dismissed, went down to Antioch; and gathering together the multi- tude, delivered the epistle.
<br>31	Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.
<br>32	But Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, with many words comforted the brethren, and confirmed them.
<br>33	And after they had spent some time there, they were let go with peace by the brethren, unto them that had sent them.
<br>34	But it seemed good unto Silas to remain there; and Judas alone departed to Jerusalem.
<br>35	And Paul and Barnabas continued at Anti- och, teaching and preaching, with many others, the word of the Lord.
<br>36	And after some days, Paul said to Barn- abas: Let us return and visit our brethren in all the cities wherein we have preached the word of the Lord, to see how they do.
<br>37	And Barnabas would have taken with them John also, that was surnamed Mark;
<br>38	But Paul desired that he (as having de- parted from them out of Pamphylia, and not gone with them to the work) might not be re- ceived.
<br>39	And there arose a dissension, so that they departed one from another; and Barnabas indeed taking Mark, sailed to Cyprus.
<br>40	But Paul choosing Silas, departed, being delivered by the brethren to the grace of God.
<br>41	And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches, commanding them to keep the precepts of the apostles and the an- cients.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 16
<br>And he came to Derbe and Lystra. And behold, there was a certain disciple there named Timo- thy, the son of a Jewish woman that believed; but his father was a Gentile.
<br>2	To this man the brethren that were in Lystra and Iconium, gave a good testimony.
<br>3	Him Paul would have to go along with him: and taking him he circumcised him, because of the Jews who were in those places. For they all knew that his father was a Gentile.
<br>4	And as they passed through the cities, they delivered unto them the decrees for to keep, that were decreed by the apostles and ancients who were at Jerusalem.
<br>5	And the churches were confirmed in faith, and increased in number daily.
<br>6	And when they had passed through Phrygia, and the country of Galatia, they were forbidden by the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia.
<br>7	And when they were come into Mysia, they attempted to go into Bythynia, and the Spirit of Jesus suffered them not.
<br>8	And when they had passed through Mysia, they went down to Troas.
<br>9	And a vision was shewed to Paul in the night, which was a man of Macedonia standing and beseeching him, and saying: Pass over into Macedonia, and help us.
<br>10	And as soon as he had seen the vision, im- mediately we sought to go into Macedonia, be- ing assured that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.
<br>11	And sailing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the day fol- lowing to Neapolis;
<br>12	And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of part of Macedonia, a colony. And we were in this city some days conferring together.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>13	And upon the sabbath day, we went forth without the gate by a river side, where it seemed that there was prayer; and sitting down, we spoke to the women that were assembled.
<br>14	And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, one that wor- shipped God, did hear: whose heart the Lord opened to attend to those things which were said by Paul.
<br>15	And when she was baptized, and her house- hold, she besought us, saying: If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us. 16 And it came to pass, as we went to prayer,
