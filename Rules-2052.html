<br>"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
<br>
<br>"This Act may be cited as the 'President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992'.
<br>"SEC. 2. FINDINGS, DECLARATIONS, AND PURPOSES.
<br>

<br>"(1) all Government records related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy should be preserved for historical and governmental purposes;
<br>
<br>"(2) all Government records concerning the assassination of President John F. Kennedy should carry a presumption of immediate disclosure, and all records should be eventually disclosed to enable the public to become fully informed about the history surrounding the assassination;
<br>
<br>"(3) legislation is necessary to create an enforceable, independent, and accountable process for the public disclosure of such records;
<br>
<br>"(4) legislation is necessary because congressional records related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy would not otherwise be subject to public disclosure until at least the year 2029;
<br>

<br>
<br>"(6) legislation is necessary because [former] Executive Order No. 12356, entitled 'National Security Information' has eliminated the declassification and downgrading schedules relating to classified information across government and has prevented the timely public disclosure of records relating to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy; and
<br>
<br>"(7) most of the records related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy are almost 30 years old, and only in the rarest cases is there any legitimate need for continued protection of such records.

<br>"(A) an intelligence agent whose identity currently requires protection;
<br>
<br>"(B) an intelligence source or method which is currently utilized, or reasonably expected to be utilized, by the United States Government and which has not been officially disclosed, the disclosure of which would interfere with the conduct of intelligence activities; or

<br>
<br>"(3) the public disclosure of the assassination record could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of privacy is so substantial that it outweighs the public interest;
<br>
<br>"(4) the public disclosure of the assassination record would compromise the existence of an understanding of confidentiality currently requiring protection between a Government agent and a cooperating individual or a foreign government, and public disclosure would be so harmful that it outweighs the public interest; or
