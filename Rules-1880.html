<br>
<br>(d) In determining whether to guarantee a loan under this subchapter, the Secretary shall consider—

<br>(2) $19,733.
<br>
<br>(c) The amount of assistance afforded under subsection (a) for an individual authorized assistance by section 2101(a) of this title shall not be reduced by reason that title to the housing unit, which is vested in the individual, is also vested in any other person, if the individual resides in the housing unit.
