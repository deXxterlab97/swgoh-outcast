<br>Both the fowl of the heavens and the beast
<br>Are fled, and gone.
<br>10And I will make Jerusalem heaps, A lair of jackals;
<br> 
<br>And I will make the cities of Judah a desolation,
<br>Without an inhabitant.
<br>
<br>11Who is the wise man, that he may understand this?
<br>And who is he to whom the mouth of the LORD hath spoken, that he may declare it?
<br>Wherefore is the land perished
<br>And laid waste like a wilderness, so that none passeth through?
<br>12 And the LORD saith:
<br>Because they have forsaken My law which I set before them,
<br>And have not hearkened to My voice, neither walked therein;
<br>13 But have walked after the stubbornness of their own heart,
<br>And after the Baalim, which their fathers taught them.
<br>14Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel:
<br>Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood,
<br>And give them water of gall to drink.
<br>15I will scatter them also among the nations,
<br>Whom neither they nor their fathers have known;
<br>And I will send the sword after them,
<br>Till I have consumed them.
<br>
<br>16Thus saith the LORD of hosts:
<br>Consider ye, and call for the mourning women, that they may come;
<br> 
<br>And send for the wise women, that they may come;
<br>17let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us,
<br>That our eyes may run down with tears,
<br>And our eyelids gush out with waters.
<br>18For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion:
<br>‘How are we undone!
<br>We are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land,
<br>Because our dwellings have cast us out.’
<br>19Yea, hear the word of the LORD, O ye women,
<br>And let your ear receive the word of His mouth,
<br>And teach your daughters wailing,
<br>And every one her neighbour lamentation:
<br>20‘For death is come up into our windows,
<br>It is entered into our palaces,
<br>To cut off the children from the street,
<br>And the young men from the broad places.—
<br>21Speak: Thus saith the LORD— And the carcasses of men fall As dung upon the open field,
<br>And as the handful after the harvestman,
<br>Which none gathereth.’
<br>
<br>22Thus saith the LORD:
<br>Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom,
<br> 
<br>Neither let the mighty man glory in his might,
<br>Let not the rich man glory in his riches;
<br>23But let him that glorieth glory in this,
<br>That he understandeth, and knoweth Me,
<br>That I am the LORD who exercise mercy,
<br>Justice, and righteousness, in the earth;
<br>For in these things I delight, Saith the LORD.
<br>
<br>24Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will punish all them that are circumcised in their uncircumcision: 25Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all that have the corners of their hair polled, that dwell in the wilderness;
<br>For all the nations are uncircumcised,
<br>But all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart.
<br>
<br>Hear ye the word which the LORD speaketh unto you, O
<br>house of Israel; 2thus saith the LORD: Learn not the way of the nations,
<br>And be not dismayed at the signs of heaven;
<br>For the nations are dismayed at them.
<br>3For the customs of the peoples are vanity;
<br> 
<br>For it is but a tree which one cutteth out of the forest,
<br>The work of the hands of the workman with the axe.
<br>4They deck it with silver and with gold,
<br>They fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.
<br>5They are like a pillar in a garden of cucumbers, and speak not;
<br>They must needs be borne, because they cannot go.
<br>Be not afraid of them, for they cannot do evil,
<br>Neither is it in them to do good.
<br>
<br>6There is none like unto Thee, O LORD;
<br>Thou art great, and Thy name is great in might.
<br>7Who would not fear Thee, O king of the nations?
<br>For it befitteth Thee;
<br>Forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their royalty,
<br>There is none like unto Thee.
<br>8But they are altogether brutish and foolish:
<br>The vanities by which they are instructed are but a stock;
<br>9Silver beaten into plates which is brought from Tarshish,
<br>And gold from Uphaz,
<br>The work of the craftsman and of the hands of the goldsmith;
<br>Blue and purple is their clothing; They are all the work of skilful men. 10But the LORD God is the true God,
<br> 
<br>He is the living God, and the everlasting King;
<br>At His wrath the earth trembleth, And the nations are not able to abide
<br>His indignation.
<br>
<br>11Thus shall ye say unto them: ‘The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, these shall perish from the earth, and from under the heavens.’
<br>
<br>12He that hath made the earth by His power,
<br>That hath established the world by His wisdom,
<br>And hath stretched out the heavens by His understanding;
<br>13At the sound of His giving a multitude of waters in the heavens,
<br>When He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth;
<br>When He maketh lightnings with the rain,
<br>And bringeth forth the wind out of His treasuries;
<br>14Every man is proved to be brutish, without knowledge,
<br>Every goldsmith is put to shame by the graven image,
<br>His molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.
<br>15They are vanity, a work of delusion;
<br>In the time of their visitation they shall perish.
<br>16Not like these is the portion of Jacob;
<br>For He is the former of all things,
<br> 
<br>And Israel is the tribe of His inheritance;
<br>The LORD of hosts is His name.
<br>
<br>
<br>17Gather up thy wares from the ground,
<br>O thou that abidest in the siege.
<br>18For thus saith the LORD: Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this time, and will distress them, that they may feel it.
<br>
<br>19Woe is me for my hurt! My wound is grievous;
<br>But I said: ‘This is but a sickness, And I must bear it.’
<br>20My tent is spoiled,
<br>And all my cords are broken;
<br>My children are gone forth of me, and they are not;
<br>There is none to stretch forth my tent any more,
<br>And to set up my curtains.
<br>21For the shepherds are become brutish,
<br>And have not inquired of the LORD; Therefore they have not prospered, And all their flocks are scattered. 22Hark! a report, behold, it cometh,
<br>And a great commotion out of the north country,
<br>To make the cities of Judah desolate,
<br>A dwelling-place of jackals.
<br>23O LORD, I know that man’s way is not his own;
<br>It is not in man to direct his steps as he walketh.
<br> 
<br>24O LORD, correct me, but in measure;
<br>Not in Thine anger, lest Thou diminish me.
<br>25Pour out Thy wrath upon the nations that know Thee not,
<br>And upon the families that call not on Thy name;
<br>For they have devoured Jacob,
<br>Yea, they have devoured him and consumed him,
<br>And have laid waste his habitation.
<br>
<br>The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD,
<br>saying: 2’Hear ye the words of this covenant, and speak unto the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem; 3and say thou unto them: Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: Cursed be the man that heareth not the words of this covenant, 4which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the iron furnace, saying: Hearken to My voice, and do them, according to all which I command you; so shall ye be My people, and I will be your God; 5that I may establish the oath which I swore unto your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as at this day.’ Then answered I, and said: ‘Amen, O LORD.’
<br>6And the LORD said unto me: ‘Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying: Hear ye the words of this covenant, and do them. 7For I
<br> 
<br>earnestly forewarned your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even unto this day, forewarning betimes and often, saying: Hearken to My voice. 8Yet they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one in the stubbornness of their evil heart; therefore I brought upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they did them not.’
<br>9And the LORD said unto me: ‘A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 10They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear My words; and they are gone after other gods to serve them; the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken My covenant which I made with their fathers. 11Therefore thus saith the LORD: Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry unto Me, I will not hearken unto them. 12Then shall the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem go and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer; but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble. 13For according to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to the shameful thing, even altars to offer unto Baal. 14Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them; for I will not hear
<br> 
<br>them in the time that they cry unto Me for their trouble.’
<br>
<br>15What hath My beloved to do in My house,
<br>Seeing she hath wrought lewdness with many,
<br>And the hallowed flesh is passed from thee?
<br>When thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest.
<br>16The LORD called thy name
<br>A leafy olive-tree, fair with goodly fruit;
<br>With the noise of a great tumult He hath kindled fire upon it,
<br>And the branches of it are broken.
<br>17For the LORD of hosts, that planted thee, hath pronounced evil against thee, because of the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have wrought for themselves in provoking Me by offering unto Baal.
<br>
<br>18And the LORD gave me knowledge of it, and I knew it;
<br>Then Thou showedst me their doings.
<br>19But I was like a docile lamb that is led to the slaughter;
<br>And I knew not that they had devised devices against me:
<br>‘Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof,
<br>And let us cut him off from the land of the living,
<br>That his name may be no more remembered.’
<br> 
<br>20But, O LORD of hosts, that judgest righteously,
<br>That triest the reins and the heart, Let me see Thy vengeance on them;
<br>For unto Thee have I revealed my cause.
<br>21Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the men of Anathoth, that seek thy life, saying: ‘Thou shalt not prophesy in the name of the LORD, that thou die not by our hand’; 22therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts:
<br>Behold, I will punish them;
<br>The young men shall die by the sword,
<br>Their sons and their daughters shall die by famine;
<br>23And there shall be no remnant unto them;
<br>For I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth,
<br>Even the year of their visitation.
<br>
<br>Right wouldest Thou be, O LORD,
<br>Were I to contend with Thee, Yet will I reason with Thee:
<br>Wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper?
<br>Wherefore are all they secure that deal very treacherously?
<br>2Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root;
<br>They grow, yea, they bring forth fruit;
<br>Thou art near in their mouth, And far from their reins.
<br>3But Thou, O LORD, knowest me,
<br> 
<br>Thou seest me, and triest my heart toward Thee;
<br>Pull them out like sheep for the slaughter,
<br>And prepare them for the day of slaughter.
<br>
<br>4How long shall the land mourn,
<br>And the herbs of the whole field wither?
<br>For the wickedness of them that dwell therein, the beasts are consumed, and the birds;
<br>Because they said: ‘He seeth not our end.’
<br>
<br>5’If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee,
<br>Then how canst thou contend with horses?
<br>And though in a land of peace thou art secure,
<br>Yet how wilt thou do in the thickets of the Jordan?
<br>6For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father,
<br>Even they have dealt treacherously with thee,
<br>Even they have cried aloud after thee;
<br>Believe them not, though they speak fair words unto thee.’
<br>
<br>7I have forsaken My house, I have cast off My heritage;
<br>I have given the dearly beloved of My soul
<br>Into the hand of her enemies.
<br>8My heritage is become unto Me
<br> 
<br>As a lion in the forest;
<br>She hath uttered her voice against Me;
<br>Therefore have I hated her.
<br>9Is My heritage unto Me as a speckled bird of prey?
<br>Are the birds of prey against her round about?
<br>Come ye, assemble all the beasts of the field,
<br>Bring them to devour.
<br>10Many shepherds have destroyed My vineyard,
<br>They have trodden My portion under foot,
<br>They have made My pleasant portion
<br>A desolate wilderness.
<br>11They have made it a desolation,
<br>It mourneth unto Me, being desolate;
<br>The whole land is made desolate, Because no man layeth it to heart. 12Upon all the high hills in the
<br>wilderness spoilers are come;
<br>For the sword of the LORD devoureth From the one end of the land even to
<br>the other end of the land, No flesh hath peace.
<br>13They have sown wheat, and have reaped thorns;
<br>They have put themselves to pain, they profit not;
<br>Be ye then ashamed of your increase,
<br>Because of the fierce anger of the LORD.
<br> 
<br>14Thus saith the LORD: As for all Mine evil neighbours, that touch the inheritance which I have caused My people Israel to inherit, behold, I will pluck them up from off their land, and will pluck up the house of Judah from among them. 15And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them up, I will again have compassion on them; and I will bring them back, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land. 16And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of My people to swear by My name: ‘As the LORD liveth, ‘even as they taught My people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built up in the midst of My people. 17But if they will not hearken, then will I pluck up that nation, plucking up and destroying it, saith the LORD.
<br>
<br>Thus said the LORD unto me: ‘Go, and get thee a linen
<br>girdle, and put it upon thy loins, and put it not in water.’ 2So I got a girdle according to the word of the LORD, and put it upon my loins.
<br>3And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying: 4’Take the girdle that thou hast gotten, which is upon thy loins, and arise, go to Perath, and hide it there in a cleft of the rock.’ 5So I went, and hid it in Perath, as the LORD commanded me. 6And it came to pass after many days, that the LORD said unto me: ‘Arise, go to Perath, and take the girdle from thence, which I commanded thee to
<br> 
<br>hide there.’ 7Then I went to Perath, and digged, and took the girdle from the place where I had hid it; and, behold, the girdle was marred, it was profitable for nothing.
<br>8Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:
<br>9Thus saith the LORD: After this manner will I mar the pride of Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem, 10even this evil people, that refuse to hear My words, that walk in the stubbornness of their heart, and are gone after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, that it be as this girdle, which is profitable for nothing. 11For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave unto Me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, saith the LORD, that they might be unto Me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory; but they would not hearken.
<br>12Moreover thou shalt speak unto them this word: Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: ‘Every bottle is filled with wine’; and when they shall say unto thee: ‘Do we not know that every bottle is filled with wine?’ 13Then shalt thou say unto them: Thus saith the LORD: Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings that sit upon David’s throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness. 14And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, saith the LORD; I
<br> 
<br>will not pity, nor spare, nor have compassion, that I should not destroy them.
<br>
<br>15Hear ye, and give ear, be not proud;
<br>For the LORD hath spoken.
<br>16Give glory to the LORD your God, Before it grow dark,
<br>And before your feet stumble Upon the mountains of twilight, And, while ye look for light,
<br>He turn it into the shadow of death, And make it gross darkness.
<br>17But if ye will not hear it,
<br>My soul shall weep in secret for your pride;
<br>And mine eyes shall weep sore, and run down with tears,
<br>Because the LORD’S flock is carried away captive.
<br>
<br>18Say thou unto the king and to the queen-mother:
<br>‘Sit ye down low;
<br>For your headtires are come down, Even your beautiful crown.’
<br>19The cities of the South are shut up, And there is none to open them;
<br>Judah is carried away captive all of it;
<br>It is wholly carried away captive.
<br>
<br>20Lift up your eyes, and behold Them that come from the north;
<br>Where is the flock that was given thee,
<br>Thy beautiful flock?
<br> 
<br>21What wilt thou say, when He shall set the friends over thee as head,
<br>Whom thou thyself hast trained against thee?
<br>Shall not pangs take hold of thee, As of a woman in travail?
<br>22And if thou say in thy heart: ‘Wherefore are these things befallen
<br>me?’—
<br>For the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts uncovered,
<br>And thy heels suffer violence.
<br>23Can the Ethiopian change his skin, Or the leopard his spots?
<br>Then may ye also do good, That are accustomed to do evil.
<br>24Therefore will I scatter them, as the stubble that passeth away
<br>By the wind of the wilderness.
<br>25This is thy lot, the portion measured unto thee from Me,
<br>Saith the LORD;
<br>Because thou hast forgotten Me, And trusted in falsehood.
<br>26Therefore will I also uncover thy skirts upon thy face,
<br>And thy shame shall appear.
<br>27Thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness of thy harlotry,
<br>On the hills in the field have I seen thy detestable acts.
<br>Woe unto thee, O Jerusalem! thou wilt not be made clean!
<br>When shall it ever be?
<br>
<br>The word of the LORD that came to  Jeremiah concerning
<br>the droughts.
<br> 
<br>2Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish,
<br>They bow down in black unto the ground;
<br>And the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.
<br>3And their nobles send their lads for water:
<br>They come to the pits, and find no water;
<br>Their vessels return empty;
<br>They are ashamed and confounded, and cover their heads.
<br>4Because of the ground which is cracked,
<br>For there hath been no rain in the land,
<br>The plowmen are ashamed, they cover their heads.
<br>5Yea, the hind also in the field calveth, and forsaketh her young,
<br>Because there is no grass,
<br>6And the wild asses stand on the high hills,
<br>They gasp for air like jackals;
<br>Their eyes fail, because there is no herbage.
<br>7Though our iniquities testify against us,
<br>O LORD, work Thou for Thy name’s sake;
<br>For our backslidings are many, We have sinned against Thee. 8O Thou hope of Israel,
<br>The Saviour thereof in time of trouble,
<br>Why shouldest Thou be as a stranger in the land,
<br>And as a wayfaring man that turneth aside to tarry for a night?
<br> 
<br>9Why shouldest thou be as a man overcome,
<br>As a mighty man that cannot save?
<br>Yet Thou, O LORD, art in the midst of us,
<br>And Thy name is called upon us; Leave us not.
<br>
<br>10Thus saith the LORD    unto this people:
<br>Even so have they loved to wander, They have not refrained their feet;
<br>Therefore the LORD doth not accept them,
<br>Now will He remember their iniquity,
<br>And punish their sins.
<br>11And the LORD said unto me: ‘Pray not for this people for their good. 12When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt- offering and meal-offering, I will not accept them; but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.’ 13Then said I: ‘Ah, Lord GOD! behold, the prophets say unto them: Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place.’ 14Then the LORD said unto me: ‘The prophets prophesy lies in My name; I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spoke I unto them; they prophesy unto you a lying vision, and divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their own heart. 15Therefore thus saith the LORD: As for the prophets that prophesy in My name, and I sent them not, yet they
<br> 
<br>say: Sword and famine shall not be in this land, by sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed; 16and the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them, them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters; for I will pour their evil upon them.’
<br>
<br>17And thou shalt say this word unto them:
<br>Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day,
<br>And let them not cease;
<br>For the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach,
<br>With a very grievous blow.
<br>18If I go forth into the field,
<br>Then behold the slain with the sword!
<br>And if I enter into the city,
<br>Then behold them that are sick with famine!
<br>For both the prophet and the priest are gone about to a land, and knew it not.
<br>
<br>19Hast Thou utterly rejected Judah? Hath Thy soul loathed Zion?
<br>Why hast Thou smitten us, and there is no healing for us?
<br>We looked for peace, but no good came;
<br>And for a time of healing, and behold terror!
<br> 
<br>20We acknowledge, O LORD, our wickedness,
<br>Even the iniquity of our fathers; For we have sinned against Thee. 21Do not contemn us, for Thy
<br>name’s sake,
<br>Do not dishonour the throne of Thy glory;
<br>Remember, break not Thy covenant with us.
<br>22Are there any among the vanities of the nations that can cause rain?
<br>Or can the heavens give showers? Art not Thou He, O LORD our God, and do we not wait for Thee?
<br>For Thou hast made all these things. Then said the LORD unto me: ‘Though Moses and Samuel
<br>stood before Me, yet My mind could not be toward this people; cast them out of My sight, and let them go forth. 2And it shall come to pass, when they say unto thee: Whither shall we go forth? then thou shall tell them: Thus saith the LORD: Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the sword, to the sword; and such as are for the famine, to the famine; and such as are for captivity, to captivity. 3And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith the LORD: the sword to slay, and the dogs to drag, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and to destroy. 4And I will cause them to be a horror among all the kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for that which he did in Jerusalem.
<br> 
<br>5For who shall have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem?
<br>Or who shall bemoan thee?
<br>Or who shall turn aside to ask of thy welfare?
<br>6Thou hast cast Me off, saith the LORD,
<br>Thou art gone backward;
<br>Therefore do I stretch out My hand against thee, and destroy thee;
<br>I am weary with repenting.
<br>7And I fan them with a fan in the gates of the land;
<br>I bereave them of children, I destroy My people,
<br>Since they return not from their ways.
<br>8Their widows are increased to Me above the sand of the seas;
<br>I bring upon them, against the mother, a chosen one,
<br>Even a spoiler at noonday;
<br>I cause anguish and terrors to fall upon her suddenly.
<br>9She that hath borne seven languisheth;
<br>Her spirit droopeth;
<br>Her sun is gone down while it was yet day,
<br>She is ashamed and confounded;
<br>And the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies,
<br>Saith the LORD.’
<br>
<br>10Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me
<br>A man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth!
<br> 
<br>I have not lent, neither have men lent to me;
<br>Yet every one of them doth curse me.
<br>11The LORD said: ‘Verily I will release thee for good; verily I will cause the enemy to make supplication unto thee in the time of evil and in the time of affliction. 12Can iron break iron from the north and brass? 13Thy substance and thy treasures will I give for a spoil without price, and that for all thy sins, even in all thy borders. 14And I will make thee to pass with thine enemies into a land which thou knowest not; for a fire is kindled in My nostril, which shall burn upon you.’
<br>
<br>15Thou, O LORD, knowest;
<br>Remember me, and think of me, and avenge me of my persecutors;
<br>Take me not away because of Thy long-suffering;
<br>Know that for Thy sake I have suffered taunts.
<br>16Thy words were found, and I did eat them;
<br>And Thy words were unto me a joy and the rejoicing of my heart;
<br>Because Thy name was called on me, O LORD God of hosts.
<br>17I sat not in the assembly of them that make merry, nor rejoiced;
<br>I sat alone because of Thy hand;
<br>For Thou hast filled me with indignation.
<br>18Why is my pain perpetual,
<br>And my wound incurable, so that it refuseth to be healed?
<br> 
<br>Wilt Thou indeed be unto me as a deceitful brook,
<br>As waters that fail?
<br>
<br>19Therefore thus saith the LORD:
<br>If thou return, and I bring thee back, Thou shalt stand before Me;
<br>And if thou bring forth the precious out of the vile,
<br>Thou shalt be as My mouth; Let them return unto thee,
<br>But thou shalt not return unto them.
<br>20And I will make thee unto this people a fortified brazen wall; And they shall fight against thee,
<br>But they shall not prevail against thee;
<br>For I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee,
<br>Saith the LORD.
<br>21And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked,
<br>And I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible.
<br>
<br>The word of the LORD came also unto me, saying:
<br>2Thou shalt not take thee a wife,
<br>Neither shalt thou have sons or daughters in this place.
<br>3For thus saith the LORD concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place, and concerning their mothers that bore them, and concerning their fathers that begot them in this land:
<br>4They shall die of grievous deaths; They shall not be lamented, Neither shall they be buried,
<br> 
<br>They shall be as dung upon the face of the ground;
<br>And they shall be consumed by the sword, and by famine;
<br>And their carcasses shall be meat for the fowls of heaven,
<br>And for the beasts of the earth.
<br>5For thus saith the LORD: Enter not into the house of mourning, neither go to lament, neither bemoan them; for I have taken away My peace from this people, saith the LORD, even mercy and compassion. 6Both the great and the small shall die in this land; they shall not be buried; neither shall men lament for them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them; 7neither shall men break bread for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead; neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother. 8And thou shalt not go into the house of feasting to sit with them, to eat and to drink. 9For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel:
<br>Behold, I will cause to cease out of this place,
<br>Before your eyes and in your days,
<br>The voice of mirth and the voice of gladness,
<br>The voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride.
<br>10And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt tell this people all these words, and they shall say unto thee: ‘Wherefore hath the LORD pronounced all this great evil against us? or what is our iniquity? or what is our sin that we
<br> 
<br>have committed against the LORD our God?’ 11then shalt thou say unto them: ‘Because your fathers have forsaken Me, saith the LORD, and have walked after other gods, and have served them, and have worshipped them, and have forsaken Me, and have not kept My law; 12and ye have done worse than your fathers; for, behold, ye walk every one after the stubbornness of his evil heart, so that ye hearken not unto Me; 13therefore will I cast you out of this land into a land that ye have not known, neither ye nor your fathers; and there shall ye serve other gods day and night; forasmuch as I will show you no favour.’
<br>14Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall no more be said: ‘As the LORD liveth, that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt, ‘15but: ‘As the LORD liveth, that brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the countries whither He had driven them’; and I will bring them back into their land that I gave unto their fathers. 16Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith the LORD, and they shall fish them; and afterward I will send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the clefts of the
<br>rocks.
<br>17For Mine eyes are upon all their ways,
<br>They are not hid from My face;
<br>Neither is their iniquity concealed from Mine eyes.
<br> 
<br>18And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double;
<br>Because they have profaned My land;
<br>They have filled Mine inheritance With the carcasses of their
<br>detestable things and their abominations.
<br>
<br>19O LORD, my strength, and my stronghold,
<br>And my refuge, in the day of affliction,
<br>Unto Thee shall the nations come From the ends of the earth, and shall
<br>say:
<br>‘Our fathers have inherited nought but lies,
<br>Vanity and things wherein there is no profit.’
<br>20Shall a man make unto himself gods,
<br>And they are no gods?
<br>
<br>21Therefore, behold, I will cause them to know,
<br>This once will I cause them to know My hand and My might;
<br>And they shall know that My name is the LORD.
<br>
<br>The sin of Judah is written With a pen of iron, and with
<br>the point of a diamond;
<br>It is graven upon the tablet of their heart,
<br>And upon the horns of your altars.
<br>2Like the symbols of their sons are their altars,
<br> 
<br>And their Asherim are by the leafy trees,
<br>Upon the high hills.
<br>3O thou that sittest upon the mountain in the field,
<br>I will give thy substance and all thy treasures for a spoil,
<br>And thy high places, because of sin, throughout all thy borders.
<br>4And thou, even of thyself, shalt discontinue from thy heritage
<br>That I gave thee;
<br>And I will cause thee to serve thine enemies
<br>In the land which thou knowest not;
<br>For ye have kindled a fire in My nostril,
<br>Which shall burn for ever.
<br>
<br>5Thus saith the LORD:
<br>Cursed is the man that trusteth in man,
<br>And maketh flesh his arm,
<br>And whose heart departeth from the LORD.
<br>6For he shall be like a tamarisk in the desert,
<br>And shall not see when good cometh;
<br>But shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness,
<br>A salt land and not inhabited.
<br>7Blessed is the man that trusteth in the LORD,
<br>And whose trust the LORD is.
<br>8For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters,
<br>And that spreadeth out its roots by the river,
<br> 
<br>And shall not see when heat cometh, But its foliage shall be luxuriant;
<br>And shall not be anxious in the year of drought,
<br>Neither shall cease from yielding fruit.
<br>
<br>9The heart is deceitful above all things,
<br>And it is exceeding weak—who can know it?
<br>10I the LORD search the heart, I try the reins,
<br>Even to give every man according to his ways,
<br>According to the fruit of his doings.
<br>
<br>11As the partridge that broodeth over young which she hath not brought forth,
<br>So is he that getteth riches, and not by right;
<br>In the midst of his days he shall leave them,
<br>And at his end he shall be a fool.
<br>
<br>12Thou throne of glory, on high from the beginning,
<br>Thou place of our sanctuary,
<br>13Thou hope of Israel, the LORD!
<br>All that forsake Thee shall be ashamed;
<br>They that depart from Thee shall be written in the earth,
<br>Because they have forsaken the LORD,
<br>The fountain of living waters.
<br> 
<br>14Heal me, O LORD, and I shall be healed;
<br>Save me, and I shall be saved; For Thou art my praise.
<br>15Behold, they say unto me: ‘Where is the word of the LORD? let
<br>it come now.’
<br>16As for me, I have not hastened from being a shepherd after Thee;
<br>Neither have I desired the woeful day; thou knowest it;
<br>That which came out of my lips was manifest before Thee.
<br>17Be not a ruin unto me;
<br>Thou art my refuge in the day of evil.
<br>18Let them be ashamed that persecute me, but let not me be ashamed;
<br>Let them be dismayed, but let not me be dismayed;
<br>Bring upon them the day of evil,
<br>And destroy them with double destruction.
<br>19Thus said the LORD unto me: Go, and stand in the gate of the children of the people, whereby the kings of Judah come in, and by which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem; 20and say unto them:
<br>Hear ye the word of the LORD, ye kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that enter in by these gates; 21thus saith the LORD: Take heed for the sake of your souls, and bear no burden on the sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem; 22neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the
<br> 
<br>sabbath day, neither do ye any work; but hallow ye the sabbath day, as I commanded your fathers; 23but they hearkened not, neither inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they might not hear, nor receive instruction. 24And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken unto Me, saith the LORD, to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day, but to hallow the sabbath day, to do no work therein; 25then shall there enter in by the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and this city shall be inhabited for ever. 26And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places round about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the Lowland, and from the mountains, and from the South, bringing burnt-offerings, and sacrifices, and meal-offerings, and frankincense, and bringing sacrifices of thanksgiving, unto the house of the LORD. 27But if ye will not hearken unto Me to hallow the sabbath day, and not to bear a burden and enter in at the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.
<br>
<br>The word which came to Jeremiah	from	the	LORD,
<br> 
<br>saying: 2’Arise, and go down to the potter’s house, and there I will cause thee to hear My words.’ 3Then I went down to the potter’s house, and, behold, he was at his work on the wheels. 4And whensoever the vessel that he made of the clay was marred in the hand of the potter, he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it.
<br>5Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying: 6’O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? saith the LORD. Behold, as the clay in the potter’s hand, so are ye in My hand, O house of Israel. 7At one instant I may speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up and to break down and to destroy it; 8but if that nation turn from their evil, because of which I have spoken against it, I repent of the evil that I thought to do unto it. 9And at one instant I may speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it; 10but if it do evil in My sight, that it hearken not to My voice, then I repent of the good, wherewith I said I would benefit it. 11Now therefore do thou speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying: Thus saith the LORD: Behold, I frame evil against you, and devise a device against you; return ye now every one from his evil way, and amend your ways and your doings. 12But they say: There is no hope; but we will walk after our own devices,
<br> 
<br>and we will do every one after the stubbornness of his evil heart.’
<br>
<br>13Therefore thus saith the LORD: Ask ye now among the nations, Who hath heard such things; The virgin of Israel hath done A very horrible thing.
<br>14Doth the snow of Lebanon fail From the rock of the field?
<br>Or are the strange cold flowing waters
<br>Plucked up?
<br>15For My people hath forgotten Me, They offer unto vanity;
<br>And they have been made to stumble in their ways,
<br>In the ancient paths, To walk in bypaths, In a way not cast up;
<br>16To make their land an astonishment,
<br>And a perpetual hissing;
<br>Every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished,
<br>And shake his head.
<br>17I will scatter them as with an east wind
<br>Before the enemy;
<br>I will look upon their back, and not their face,
<br>In the day of their calamity.
<br>
<br>18Then said they:
<br>‘Come, and let us devise devices against Jeremiah;
<br>For instruction shall not perish from the priest,
<br> 
<br>Nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet.
<br>Come, and let us smite him with the tongue,
<br>And let us not give heed to any of his words.’
<br>19Give heed to me, O LORD,
<br>And hearken to the voice of them that contend with me.
<br>20Shall evil be recompensed for good?
<br>For they have digged a pit for my soul.
<br>Remember how I stood before Thee To speak good for them,
<br>To turn away Thy wrath from them.
<br>21Therefore deliver up their children to the famine,
<br>And hurl them to the power of the sword;
<br>And let their wives be bereaved of their children, and widows;
<br>And let their men be slain of death,
<br>And their young men smitten of the sword in battle.
<br>22Let a cry be heard from their houses,
<br>When thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them;
<br>For they have digged a pit to take me,
<br>And hid snares for my feet.
<br>23Yet, LORD, Thou knowest
<br>All their counsel against me to slay me;
<br>Forgive not their iniquity,
<br>Neither blot out their sin from Thy sight;
<br> 
<br>But let them be made to stumble before Thee;
<br>Deal Thou with them in the time of Thine anger.
<br>
<br>Thus said the LORD: Go, and get a potter’s earthen bottle,
<br>and take of the elders of the people, and of the elders of the priests; 2and go forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is by the entry of the gate Harsith, and proclaim there the words that I shall tell thee; 3and say: Hear ye the word of the LORD, O kings of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem; thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel:
<br>Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, which whosoever heareth, his ears shall tingle; 4because they have forsaken Me, and have estranged this place, and have offered in it unto other gods, whom neither they nor their fathers have known, nor the kings of Judah; and have filled this place with the blood of innocents; 5and have built the high places of Baal, to burn their sons in the fire for burnt-offerings unto Baal; which I commanded not, nor spoke it, neither came it into My mind. 6Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that this place shall no more be called Topheth, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom, but The valley of slaughter; 7and I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place; and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hand of them
<br> 
<br>that seek their life; and their carcasses will I give to be food for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; 8and I will make this city an astonishment, and a hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all the plagues thereof; 9and I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters, and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend, in the siege and in the straitness, wherewith their enemies, and they that seek their life, shall straiten them. 10Then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with thee, 11and shalt say unto them: Thus saith the LORD of hosts: Even so will I break this people and this city, as one breaketh a potter’s vessel, that cannot be made whole again; and they shall bury in Topheth, for want of room to bury. 12Thus will I do unto this place, saith the LORD, and to the inhabitants thereof, even making this city as Topheth; 13and the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, which are defiled, shall be as the place of Topheth, even all the houses upon whose roofs they have offered unto all the host of heaven, and have poured out drink-offerings unto other gods.
<br>
<br>14Then came Jeremiah from Topheth, whither the LORD had sent him to prophesy; and he stood in the court of the LORD’S house, and said to all the people: 15’Thus saith the LORD
<br> 
<br>of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the evil that I have pronounced against it; because they have made their neck stiff, that they might not hear My words.’
<br>Now Pashhur the son of Immer the priest, who was
<br>chief officer in the house of the LORD, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things. 2Then Pashhur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the upper gate of Benjamin, which was in the house of the LORD. 3And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashhur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah unto him: ‘The LORD hath not called thy name Pashhur, but aMagormissabib. 4For thus saith the LORD: Behold, I will make thee a terror to thyself, and to all thy friends; and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thine eyes shall behold it; and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive to Babylon, and shall slay them with the sword. 5Moreover I will give all the store of this city, and all the gains thereof, and all the wealth thereof, yea, all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies, who shall spoil them, and take them, and carry them to Babylon. 6And thou, Pashhur, and all that dwell in thy house shall go into captivity; and thou
<br>
<br>a That is, Terror on every side.
<br> 
<br>shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and there shalt thou be buried, thou, and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied falsely.’
<br>
<br>7O LORD, Thou hast enticed me, and I was enticed,
<br>Thou hast overcome me, and hast prevailed;
<br>I am become a laughing-stock all the day,
<br>Every one mocketh me.
<br>8For as often as I speak, I cry out, I cry: ‘Violence and spoil’;
<br>Because the word of the LORD is made
<br>A reproach unto me, and a derision, all the day.
<br>9And if I say: ‘I will not make mention of Him,
<br>Nor speak any more in His name’,
<br>Then there is in my heart as it were a burning fire
<br>Shut up in my bones,
<br>And I weary myself to hold it in, But cannot.
<br>10For I have heard the whispering of many,
<br>Terror on every side:
<br>‘Denounce, and we will denounce him’;
<br>Even of all my familiar friends, Them that watch for my halting: ‘Peradventure he will be enticed,
<br>and we shall prevail against him,
<br>And we shall take our revenge on him.’
<br>11But the LORD is with me as a mighty warrior;
<br> 
<br>Therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail;
<br>They shall be greatly ashamed, because they have not prospered,
<br>Even with an everlasting confusion which shall never be forgotten.
<br>12But, O LORD of hosts, that triest the righteous,
<br>That seest the reins and the heart, Let me see Thy vengeance on them;
<br>For unto Thee have I revealed my cause.
<br>
<br>13Sing unto the LORD, Praise ye the LORD;
<br>For He hath delivered the soul of the needy
<br>From the hand of evil-doers.
<br>
<br>14Cursed be the day Wherein I was born;
<br>The day wherein my mother bore me,
<br>Let it not be blessed.
<br>15Cursed be the man who brought tidings
<br>To my father, saying:
<br>‘A man-child is born unto thee’; Making him very glad.
<br>16And let that man be as the cities Which the LORD overthrew, and
<br>repented not;
<br>And let him hear a cry in the morning,
<br>And an alarm at noontide;
<br>17Because He slew me not from the womb;
<br> 
<br>And so my mother would have been my grave,
<br>And her womb always great.
<br>18Wherefore came I forth out of the womb
<br>To see labour and sorrow,
<br>That my days should be consumed in shame?
<br>
<br>The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when
<br>king Zedekiah sent unto him Pashhur the son of Malchiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, saying: 2’Inquire, I pray thee, of the LORD for us; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon maketh war against us; peradventure the LORD will deal with us according to all His wondrous works, that he may go up from us.’
<br>3Then said Jeremiah unto them: Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah: 4Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel:
<br>Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, wherewith ye fight against the king of Babylon, and against the Chaldeans, that besiege you without the walls, and I will gather them into the midst of this city. 5And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath. 6And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast; they shall die of a great pestilence. 7And afterward, saith the LORD, I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah, and his servants, and the people, and such as are left in this city
<br> 
<br>from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those that seek their life; and he shall smite them with the edge of the sword; he shall not spare them, neither have pity, nor have compassion.
<br>8And unto this people thou shalt say: Thus saith the LORD: Behold, I set before you the way of life and the way of death. 9He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence; but he that goeth out, and falleth away to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be unto him for a prey. 10For I have set My face against this city for evil, and not for good, saith the LORD; it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.
<br>11And unto the house of the king of Judah: Hear ye the word of the LORD; 12O house of David, thus saith the LORD:
<br>Execute justice in the morning,
<br>And deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor,
<br>Lest My fury go forth like fire, And burn that none can quench it, Because of the evil of your doings.
<br>
<br>13Behold, I am against thee, O inhabitant of the valley,
<br>And rock of the plain, saith the LORD;
<br> 
<br>Ye that say: ‘Who shall come down against us?
<br>Or who shall enter into our habitations?’
<br>14And I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings,
<br>Saith the LORD;
<br>And I will kindle a fire in her forest,
<br>And it shall devour all that is round about her.
<br>
<br>Thus said the LORD: Go down to the house of the king of
<br> 
<br>Yet surely I will make thee a wilderness,
<br>Cities which are not inhabited.
<br>7And I will prepare destroyers against thee,
<br>Every one with his weapons;
<br>And they shall cut down thy choice cedars,
<br>And cast them into the fire.
<br>8And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say every man to his neighbour: ‘Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this great city?’
<br> 
<br>Judah, and speak there this word, 2and say: Hear the word of the LORD, O king of Judah, that sittest upon the throne of David, thou, and thy servants, and thy people that enter in by these gates. 3Thus saith the LORD:
<br>Execute ye justice and righteousness, and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor; and do no wrong, do no violence, to the stranger, the fatherless, nor the widow, neither shed innocent blood in this place. 4For if ye do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, he, and his servants, and his people. 5But if ye will not hear these words, I swear by Myself, saith the LORD, that this house shall become a desolation. 6For thus saith the LORD concerning the house of the king of Judah:
<br>Thou art Gilead unto Me, The head of Lebanon;
<br> 
<br>9Then they shall answer: ‘Because they forsook the covenant of the LORD their God, and worshipped other gods, and served them.’
<br>
<br>10Weep ye not for the dead, Neither bemoan him;
<br>But weep sore for him that goeth away,
<br>For he shall return no more, Nor see his native country.
<br>11For thus saith the LORD touching Shallum the son of Josiah, king of Judah, who reigned instead of Josiah his father, and who went forth out of this place: He shall not return thither any more; 12but in the place whither they have led him captive, there shall he die, and he shall see this land no more.
<br>
<br>13Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness,
<br>And his chambers by injustice;
<br>That useth his neighbour’s service without wages,
<br> 
<br>And giveth him not his hire;
<br>14That saith: ‘I will build me a wide house
<br>And spacious chambers’,
<br>And cutteth him out windows,
<br>And it is ceiled with cedar, and painted with vermilion.
<br>15Shalt thou reign, because thou strivest to excel in cedar?
<br>Did not thy father eat and drink, and do justice and righteousness?
<br>Then it was well with him.
<br>16He judged the cause of the poor and needy;
<br>Then it was well.
<br>Is not this to know Me? saith the LORD.
<br>17But thine eyes and thy heart Are not but for thy covetousness, And for shedding innocent blood,
<br>And for oppression, and for violence, to do it.
<br>18Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah:
<br>They shall not lament for him: ‘Ah my brother! ’ or: ‘Ah sister! ’ They shall not lament for him: ‘Ah lord! ’ or: ‘Ah his glory! ’
<br>19He shall be buried with the burial of an ass,
<br>Drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.
<br>
<br>20Go up to Lebanon, and cry, And lift up thy voice in Bashan; And cry from Abarim,
<br>For all thy lovers are destroyed.
<br>21I spoke unto thee in thy prosperity,
<br> 
<br>But thou saidst: ‘I will not hear.’
<br>This hath been thy manner from thy youth,
<br>That thou hearkenedst not to My voice.
<br>22The wind shall feed upon all thy shepherds,
<br>And thy lovers shall go into captivity;
<br>Surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded
<br>For all thy wickedness.
<br>23O inhabitant of Lebanon, That art nestled in the cedars,
<br>How gracious shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee,
<br>The pain as of a woman in travail!
<br>24As I live, saith the LORD, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon My right hand, yet would I pluck thee thence; 25and I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life, and into the hand of them of whom thou art afraid, even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans. 26And I will cast thee out, and thy mother that bore thee, into another country, where ye were not born; and there shall ye die. 27But to the land whereunto they long to return, thither shall they not return.
<br>28Is this man Coniah a despised, broken image?
<br>Is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure?
<br>Wherefore are they cast out, he and his seed,
<br> 
<br>And are cast into the land which they know not?
<br>29O land, land, land,
<br>Hear the word of the LORD.
<br>30Thus saith the LORD:
<br>Write ye this man childless,
<br>A man that shall not prosper in his days;
<br>For no man of his seed shall prosper,
<br>Sitting upon the throne of David, And ruling any more in Judah.
<br>
<br>Woe unto the shepherds that destroy and scatter
<br>The sheep of My pasture! saith the LORD.
<br>2Therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, against the shepherds that feed My people: Ye have scattered My flock, and driven them away, and have not taken care of them; behold, I will visit upon you the evil of your doings, saith the LORD. 3And I will gather the remnant of My flock out of all the countries whither I have driven them, and will bring them back to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and multiply. 4And I will set up shepherds over them, who shall feed them; and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall any be lacking, saith the LORD.
<br>5Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will raise unto David a righteous shoot, and he shall reign as king and prosper, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.
<br> 
<br>6In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely; and this is his name whereby he shall be called, The LORD is our righteousness.
<br>7Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that they shall no more say: ‘As the LORD liveth, that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt’; 8but: ‘As the LORD liveth, that brought up and that led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all the countries whither I had driven them’; and they shall dwell in their own land.
<br>
<br>9Concerning the prophets.
<br>
<br>My heart within me is broken, All my bones shake;
<br>I am like a drunken man,
<br>And like a man whom wine hath overcome;
<br>Because of the LORD,
<br>And because of His holy words.
<br>10For the land is full of adulterers;
<br>For because of swearing the land mourneth,
<br>The pastures of the wilderness are dried up;
<br>And their course is evil, And their force is not right.
<br>11For both prophet and priest are ungodly;
<br>Yea, in My house have I found their wickedness,
<br>Saith the LORD.
<br> 
<br>12Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery places in the darkness,
<br>They shall be thrust, and fall therein;
<br>For I will bring evil upon them, Even the year of their visitation, Saith the LORD.
<br>
<br>13And I have seen unseemliness in the prophets of Samaria:
<br>They prophesied by Baal,
<br>And caused My people Israel to err.
<br>14But in the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen a horrible thing:
<br>They commit adultery, and walk in lies,
<br>And they strengthen the hands of evil-doers,
<br>That none doth return from his wickedness;
<br>They are all of them become unto Me as Sodom,
<br>And the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah.
<br>15Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets:
<br>Behold, I will feed them with wormwood,
<br>And make them drink the water of gall;
<br>For from the prophets of Jerusalem Is ungodliness gone forth into all the
<br>land.
<br>
<br>16Thus saith the LORD of hosts:
<br>Hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you,
<br>They lead you unto vanity;
<br> 
<br>They speak a vision of their own heart,
<br>And not out of the mouth of the LORD.
<br>17They say continually unto them that despise Me:
<br>‘The LORD hath said: Ye shall have peace’;
<br>And unto every one that walketh in the stubbornness of his own heart they say:
<br>‘No evil shall come upon you’;
<br>18For who hath stood in the council of the LORD,
<br>That he should perceive and hear His word?
<br>Who hath attended to His word, and heard it?
<br>
<br>19Behold, a storm of the LORD is gone forth in fury,
<br>Yea, a whirling storm;
<br>It shall whirl upon the head of the wicked.
<br>20The anger of the LORD shall not return,
<br>Until He have executed, and till He have performed the purposes of His heart;
<br>Iin the end of days ye shall consider it perfectly.
<br>21I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran;
<br>I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied.
<br>22But if they have stood in My council,
<br>Then let them cause My people to hear My words,
<br> 
<br>And turn them from their evil way, And from the evil of their doings.
<br>
<br>23Am I a God near at hand, saith the LORD,
<br>And not a God afar off?
<br>24Can any hide himself in secret places
<br>That I shall not see him? saith the LORD.
<br>Do not I fill heaven and earth? Saith the LORD.
<br>25I have heard what the prophets have said,
<br>That prophesy lies in My name, saying:
<br>‘I have dreamed, I have dreamed.’
<br>26How long shall this be?
<br>Is it in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies,
<br>And the prophets of the deceit of their own heart?
<br>27That think to cause My people to forget My name
<br>By their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour,
<br>As their fathers forgot My name for Baal.
<br>28The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream;
<br>And he that hath My word; let him speak My word faithfully.
<br>What hath the straw to do with the wheat?
<br>Saith the LORD.
<br>29Is not My word like as fire? Saith the LORD;
<br>And like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?
<br> 
<br>30Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, saith the LORD, that steal My words every one from his neighbour. 31Behold, I am against the prophets, saith the LORD, that use there tongues and say: ‘He saith.’ 32Behold, I am against them that prophesy lying dreams, saith the LORD, and do tell them, and cause My people to err by their lies, and by their wantonness; yet I sent them not, nor commanded them; neither can they profit this people at all, saith the LORD.
<br>33And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee, saying: ‘What is the burden of the LORD?’ then shalt thou say unto them: ‘What burden! I will cast you off, saith the LORD.’ 34And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that shall say: ‘The burden of the LORD’, I will even punish that man and his house. 35Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour, and every one to his brother: ‘What hath the LORD answered?’ and: ‘What hath the LORD spoken?’ 36And the burden of the LORD shall ye mention no more; for every man’s own word shall be his burden; and would ye pervert the words of the living God, of the LORD of hosts our God? 37Thus shalt thou say to the prophet: ‘What hath the LORD answered thee?’ and: ‘What hath the LORD spoken?’ 38But if ye say: ‘The burden of the LORD’; therefore thus saith the LORD: Because ye say this word: ‘The burden of the LORD’, and I have sent unto you, saying: ‘Ye shall
<br> 
<br>not say: The burden of the LORD’; 39therefore, behold, I will utterly tear you out, and I will cast you off, and the city that I gave unto you and to your fathers, away from My presence; 40and I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten
<br>
<br>The LORD showed me, and behold two baskets of figs set
<br>before the temple of the LORD; after that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the craftsmen and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon. 2One basket had very good figs, like the figs that are first-ripe; and the other basket had very bad figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad. 3Then said the LORD unto me: ‘What seest thou, Jeremiah?’ And I said: ‘Figs; the good figs, very good; and the bad, very bad, that cannot be eaten, they are so bad.’ 4And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying: 5’Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: Like these good figs, so will I regard the captives of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans, for good. 6And I will set Mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them back to this land; and I will build them, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up. 7And I will give them a heart to know Me, that I am the LORD; and they shall be
<br> 
<br>My people, and I will be their God; for they shall return unto Me with their whole heart. 8And as the bad figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so bad; surely thus saith the LORD: So will I make Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and them that dwell in the land of Egypt; 9I will even make them a horror among all the kingdoms of the earth for evil; a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places whither I shall drive them. 10And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them, till they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers.’
<br>
<br>The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the
<br>people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, that was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; 2which Jeremiah the prophet spoke unto all the people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying:
<br>3From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, even unto this day, these three and twenty years, the word of the LORD hath come unto me, and I have spoken unto you, speaking betimes and often; but ye have not hearkened. 4And the LORD hath sent unto you all His servants the prophets, sending them betimes and often—but ye have not hearkened, nor inclined your ear to hear— 5saying:
<br> 
<br>‘Return ye now every one from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that the LORD hath given unto you and to your fathers, for ever and ever; 6and go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke Me not with the work of your hands, and I will do you no hurt.’ 7Yet ye have not hearkened unto Me, saith the LORD; that ye might provoke Me with the work of your hands to your own hurt. 8Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts: Because ye have not heard My words, 9behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, saith the LORD, and I will send unto Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, My servant, and will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these nations round about; and I will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and a hissing, and perpetual desolations. 10Moreover I will cause to cease from among them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the lamp. 11And this whole land shall be a desolation, and a waste; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years. 12And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, saith the LORD, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans; and I will make
<br> 
<br>it perpetual desolations. 13And I will bring upon that land all My words which I have pronounced against it, even all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations. 14For many nations and great kings shall make bondmen of them also; and I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the work of their own hands.
<br>15For thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, unto me: Take this cup of the wine of fury at My hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send thee, to drink it. 16And they shall drink, and reel to and fro, and be like madmen, because of the sword that I will send among them.—17Then took I the cup of the LORD’S hand, and made all the nations to drink, unto whom the LORD had sent me: 18Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and the kings thereof, and the princes thereof, to make them an appalment, an astonishment, a hissing, and a curse; as it is this day; 19Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes, and all his people; 20and all the mingled people; and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Gaza, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod; 21Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon; 22and all the kings of Tyre, and all the kings of Zidon, and the kings of the isle which is beyond the sea; 23Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all that have the corners
<br> 
<br>of their hair polled; 24and all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the wilderness; 25and all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes; 26and all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another; and all the kingdoms of the world, which are upon the face of the earth.—And the king of aSheshach shall drink after them. 27And thou shalt say unto them: Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Drink ye, and be drunken, and spew, and fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you. 28And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thy hand to drink, then shalt thou say unto them: Thus saith the LORD of hosts: Ye shall surely drink. 29For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city whereupon My name is called, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished; for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith the LORD of hosts.
<br>30Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say unto them:
<br>The LORD doth roar from on high,
<br>And utter His voice from His holy habitation;
<br>He doth mightily roar because of His fold;
<br>He giveth a shout, as they that tread the grapes,
<br>
<br>a According to ancient tradition, a cipher for Babel.
<br> 
<br>Against all the inhabitants of the earth.
<br>31A noise is come even to the end of the earth;
<br>For the LORD hath a controversy with the nations,
<br>He doth plead with all flesh;
<br>As for the wicked, He hath given them to the sword,
<br>Saith the LORD.
<br>
<br>32Thus saith the LORD of hosts: Behold, evil shall go forth From nation to nation,
<br>And a great storm shall be raised up From the uttermost parts of the
<br>earth.
<br>33And the slain of the LORD shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth; they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the face of the ground.
<br>34Wail, ye shepherds, and cry;
<br>And wallow yourselves in the dust, ye leaders of the flock;
<br>For the days of your slaughter are fully come,
<br>And I will break you in pieces,
<br>And ye shall fall like a precious vessel.
<br>35And the shepherds shall have no way to flee,
<br>Nor the leaders of the flock to escape.
<br>36Hark! the cry of the shepherds,
<br>And the wailing of the leaders of the flock!
<br> 
<br>For the LORD despoileth their pasture.
<br>37And the peaceable folds are brought to silence
<br>Because of the fierce anger of the LORD.
<br>38He hath forsaken His covert, as the lion;
<br>For their land is become a waste Because of the fierceness of the
<br>oppressing sword,
<br>And because of His fierce anger.
<br>
<br>In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah,
<br>king of Judah, came this word from the LORD, saying: 2’Thus saith the LORD: Stand in the court of the LORD’S house, and speak unto all the cities of Judah, which come to worship in the LORD’S house, all the words that I command thee to speak unto them; diminish not a word. 3It may be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way; that I may repent Me of the evil, which I purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings. 4And thou shalt say unto them: Thus saith the LORD: If ye will not hearken to Me, to walk in My law, which I have set before you, 5to hearken to the words of My servants the prophets, whom I send unto you, even sending them betimes and often, but ye have not hearkened; 6then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.’
<br> 
<br>7So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD. 8Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the LORD had commanded him to speak unto all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people laid hold on him, saying: ‘Thou shalt surely die. 9Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying: This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate, without an inhabitant?’ And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.
<br>10When the princes of Judah heard these things, they came up from the king’s house unto the house of the LORD; and they sat in the entry of the new gate of the LORD’S house. 11Then spoke the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people, saying: ‘This man is worthy of death; for he hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears.’ 12Then spoke Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people, saying: ‘The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard. 13Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and hearken to the voice of the LORD your God; and the LORD will repent Him of the evil that He hath pronounced against you. 14But as for me, behold, I am in your hand; do with me as is good and right in your eyes. 15Only know ye for certain that, if ye
<br> 
<br>put me to death, ye will bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon the inhabitants thereof; for of a truth the LORD hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears.’
<br>16Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets: ‘This man is not worthy of death; for he hath spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God.’ 17Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying: 18’Micah the Morashtite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah; and he spoke to all the people of Judah, saying: Thus saith the LORD of hosts:
<br>Zion shall be plowed as a field, And Jerusalem shall become heaps,
<br>And the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.
<br>19Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death? did he not fear the LORD, and entreat the favour of the LORD, and the LORD repented Him of the evil which He had pronounced against them? Thus might we procure great evil against our own souls.’
<br>20And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the LORD, Uriah the son of Shemaiah of Kiriath- jearim; and he prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah; 21and when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to
<br> 
<br>death; but when Uriah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt; 22and Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and certain men with him, into Egypt; 23and they fetched forth Uriah out of Egypt, and brought him unto Jehoiakim the king; who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the children of the people. 24Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.
<br>
<br>In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah,
<br>king of Judah, came this word unto Jeremiah from the LORD, saying: 2’Thus saith the LORD to me: Make thee bands and bars, and put them upon thy neck; 3and send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the children of Ammon, and to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers that come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah; 4and give them a charge unto their masters, saying: Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Thus shall ye say unto your masters: 5I have made the earth, the man and the beast that are upon the face of the earth, by My great power and by My outstretched arm; and I give it unto whom it seemeth right unto Me. 6And now have I given all these lands into
<br> 
<br>the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, My servant; and the beasts of the field also have I given him to serve him. 7And all the nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son’s son, until the time of his own land come; and then many nations and great kings shall make him their bondman. 8And it shall come to pass, that the nation and the kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation will I visit, saith the LORD, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand. 9But as for you, hearken ye not to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreams, nor to your soothsayers, nor to your sorcerers, that speak unto you, saying: Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon; 10for they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from your land; and that I should drive you out and ye should perish. 11But the nation that shall bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, that nation will I let remain in their own land, saith the LORD; and they shall till it, and dwell therein.’
<br>12And I spoke to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying: ‘Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live. 13Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as the LORD hath spoken
<br> 
<br>concerning the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon? 14And hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you, saying: Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon, for they prophesy a lie unto you. 15For I have not sent them, saith the LORD, and they prophesy falsely in My name; that I might drive you out, and that ye might perish, ye, and the prophets that prophesy unto you.’
<br>16Also I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying: ‘Thus saith the LORD: Hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you, saying: Behold, the vessels of the LORD’S house shall now shortly be brought back from Babylon; for they prophesy a lie unto you. 17Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live; wherefore should this city become desolate? 18But if they be prophets, and if the word of the LORD be with them, let them now make intercession to the LORD of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of the LORD, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to Babylon. 19For thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the vessels that remain in this city, 20which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem; 21yea,
<br> 
<br>thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that remain in the house of the LORD, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem: 22They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be, until the day that I remember them, saith the LORD, and bring them up, and restore them to this place.’
<br>And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the
<br>reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azzur the prophet, who was of Gibeon, spoke unto me in the house of the LORD, in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying: 2’Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying: I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon. 3Within two full years will I bring back into this place all the vessels of the LORD’S house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place, and carried them to Babylon; 4and I will bring back to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that went to Babylon, saith the LORD; for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.’ 5Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the LORD, 6even the prophet Jeremiah said: ‘Amen! the LORD do so! the LORD perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to
<br> 
<br>bring back the vessels of the LORD’S house, and all them that are carried away captive, from Babylon unto this place! 7Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears, and in the ears of all the people: 8The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence. 9The prophet that prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that the LORD hath truly sent him.’
<br>10Then Hananiah the prophet took the bar from off the prophet Jeremiah’s neck, and broke it. 11And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying: ‘Thus saith the LORD: Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from off the neck of all the nations within two full years.’ And the prophet Jeremiah went his way. 12Then the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the bar from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying: 13’Go, and tell Hananiah, saying: Thus saith the LORD: Thou hast broken the bars of wood; but thou shalt make in their stead bars of iron. 14For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him; and I have given him the beasts of the field also.’
<br> 
<br>15Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet: ‘Hear now, Hananiah; the LORD hath not sent thee; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie. 16’Therefore thus saith the LORD: Behold, I will send thee away from off the face of the earth; this year thou shalt die, because thou hast spoken perversion against the LORD.’ 17So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.
<br>Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet
<br>sent from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders of the captivity, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people, whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon, 2after that Jeconiah the king, and the queen- mother, and the officers, and the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the craftsmen, and the smiths, were departed from Jerusalem; 3by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, saying:
<br>4Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all the captivity, whom I have caused to be carried away captive from Jerusalem unto Babylon:
<br>5Build ye houses, and dwell in them, and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them; 6take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to
<br> 
<br>husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters; and multiply ye there, and be not diminished. 7And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away captive, and pray unto the LORD for it; for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace.
<br>8For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Let not your prophets that are in the midst of you, and your diviners, beguile you, neither hearken ye to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed. 9For they prophesy falsely unto you in My name; I have not sent them, saith the LORD.
<br>10For thus saith the LORD: After seventy years are accomplished for Babylon, I will remember you, and perform My good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place. 11For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you a future and a hope. 12And ye shall call upon Me, and go, and pray unto Me, and I will hearken unto you. 13And ye shall seek Me, and find Me, when ye shall search for Me with all your heart. 14And I will be found of you, saith the LORD, and I will turn your captivity, and gather you from all the nations, and from all the places whither I have driven you, saith the LORD; and I will bring you back unto the place whence I caused you to be carried away captive. 15For ye have said: ‘The LORD hath raised us up prophets in Babylon.’ 16For thus saith the LORD concerning the king that sitteth upon the throne of
<br> 
<br>David, and concerning all the people that dwell in this city, your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity; 17thus saith the LORD of hosts: Behold, I will send upon them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so bad. 18And I will pursue after them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will make them a horror unto all the kingdoms of the earth, a curse, and an astonishment, and a hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations whither I have driven them; 19because they have not hearkened to My words, saith the LORD, wherewith I sent unto them My servants the prophets, sending them betimes and often; but ye would not hear, saith the LORD. 20Hear ye therefore the word of the LORD, all ye of the captivity, whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon: 21Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and concerning Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who prophesy a lie unto you in My name: Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall slay them before your eyes; 22and of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah that are in Babylon, saying: ‘The LORD make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire’; 23because they have wrought vile deeds in Israel, and have committed
<br> 
<br>adultery with their neighbours’wives, and have spoken words in My name falsely, which I commanded them not; but I am He that knoweth, and am witness, saith the LORD.
<br>24And concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite thou shalt speak, saying: 25Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying: Because thou hast sent letters in thine own name unto all the people that are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying: 26’The LORD hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that there should be officers in the house of the LORD for every man that is mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put him in the stocks and in the collar. 27Now therefore, why hast thou not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth, who maketh himself a prophet to you, 28forasmuch as he hath sent unto us in Babylon, saying: The captivity is long; build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them?’ 29And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet. 30Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying: 31Send to all them of the captivity, saying: Thus saith the LORD concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because that Shemaiah hath prophesied unto you, and I sent him not, and he hath caused you to trust in a lie; 32therefore thus saith the LORD: Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and his
<br> 
<br>seed; he shall not have a man to dwell among this people, neither shall he behold the good that I will do unto My people, saith the LORD; because he hath spoken perversion against the LORD.
<br>
<br>The	word		that		came	to Jeremiah	from	the	LORD,
<br>saying: 2’Thus speaketh the LORD, the God of Israel, saying: Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book. 3For, lo, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will turn the captivity of My people Israel and Judah, saith the LORD; and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.’ 4And these are the words that the LORD  spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah. 5For thus saith the
<br>LORD:
<br>We have heard a voice of trembling, Of fear, and not of peace.
<br>6Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child;
<br>Wherefore do I see every man With his hands on his loins, as a
<br>woman in travail,
<br>And all faces are turned into paleness?
<br>7Alas! for that day is great, So that none is like it;
<br>And it is a time of trouble unto Jacob,
<br>But out of it shall he be saved.
<br>8And it shall come to pass in that day,
<br>Saith the LORD of hosts,
<br> 
<br>That I will break his yoke from off thy neck,
<br>And will burst thy bands;
<br>And strangers shall no more make him their bondman;
<br>9But they shall serve the LORD their God,
<br>And David their king,
<br>Whom I will raise up unto them.
<br>
<br>10Therefore fear thou not, O Jacob My servant, saith the LORD;
<br>Neither be dismayed, O Israel; For, lo, I will save thee from afar,
<br>And thy seed from the land of their captivity;
<br>And Jacob shall again be quiet and at ease,
<br>And none shall make him afraid.
<br>11For I am with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee;
<br>For I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have scattered thee,
<br>But I will not make a full end of thee;
<br>For I will correct thee in measure, And will not utterly destroy thee.
<br>
<br>12For thus saith the LORD:
<br>Thy hurt is incurable,
<br>And thy wound is grievous.
<br>13None deemeth of thy wound that it may be bound up;
<br>Thou hast no healing medicines. 14All thy lovers have forgotten thee, They seek thee not;
<br>For I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy,
<br> 
<br>With the chastisement of a cruel one;
<br>For the greatness of thine iniquity, Because thy sins were increased. 15Why criest thou for thy hurt, That thy pain is incurable?
<br>For the greatness of thine iniquity, because thy sins were increased,
<br>I have done these things unto thee.
<br>16Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured,
<br>And all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity;
<br>And they that spoil thee shall be a spoil,
<br>And all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.
<br>17For I will restore health unto thee, And I will heal thee of thy wounds,
<br>saith the LORD;
<br>Because they have called thee an outcast:
<br>‘She is aZion, there is none that careth for her.’
<br>
<br>18Thus saith the LORD:
<br>Behold, I will turn the captivity of Jacob’s tents,
<br>And have compassion on his dwelling-places;
<br>And the city shall be builded upon her own mound,
<br>And the palace shall be inhabited upon its wonted place.
<br>19And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving
<br>
<br>a With a play on the meaning, a dry land.
<br> 
<br>And the voice of them that make merry;
<br>And I will multiply them, and they shall not be diminished,
<br>I will also increase them, and they shall not dwindle away.
<br>20Their children also shall be as aforetime,
<br>And their congregation shall be established before Me,
<br>And I will punish all that oppress them.
<br>21And their prince shall be of themselves,
<br>And their ruler shall proceed from the midst of them;
<br>And I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto Me;
<br>For who is he that hath pledged his heart
