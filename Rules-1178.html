<br>"(6) Secretary of State Mike Pompeo participated in the trilateral summit among Israel, Greece, and Cyprus on March 20, 2019.
<br>
<br>"(7) The United States, Israel, Greece, and Cyprus oppose any action in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Aegean Sea that could challenge stability, violate international law, or undermine good neighborly relations, and in a joint declaration on March 21, 2019, agreed to 'defend against external malign influences in the Eastern Mediterranean and the broader Middle East'.
<br>
<br>"(8) The recent discovery of what may be the region's largest natural gas field off the Egyptian coast and the newest discoveries of natural gas off the coast of Cyprus could represent a significant and positive development for the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East, enhancing the region's strategic energy significance.
<br>
<br>"(9) It is in the national security interest of the United States to promote, achieve, and maintain energy security among, and through cooperation with, allies.
<br>
<br>"(10) Natural gas developments in the Eastern Mediterranean have the potential to provide economic gains and contribute to energy security in the region and Europe, as well as support European efforts to diversify away from natural gas supplied by the Russian Federation.
<br>
<br>"(11) The soon to be completed Trans Adriatic Pipeline is a critical component of the Southern Gas Corridor and the European Union's efforts to diversify energy resources.
<br>
<br>"(12) The proposed Eastern Mediterranean pipeline, if commercially viable, would provide for energy diversification in accordance with the European Union's third energy package of reforms.
<br>
<br>"(13) The United States acknowledges the achievements and importance of the Binational Industrial Research and Development Foundation (BIRD) and the United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF) and supports continued multiyear funding to ensure the continuity of the programs of the Foundations.
<br>
<br>"(14) The United States has welcomed Greece's allocation of 2 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) to defense in accordance with commitments made at the 2014 NATO Summit in Wales.
<br>
<br>"(15) Energy exploration in the Eastern Mediterranean region must be safeguarded against threats posed by terrorist and extremist groups, including Hezbollah and any other actor in the region.
<br>
<br>"(16) The energy exploration in the Republic of Cyprus's Exclusive Economic Zone and territorial waters—
<br>
<br>"(A) furthers United States interests by providing a potential alternative to Russian gas for United States allies and partners; and
<br>
<br>"(B) should not be impeded by other sovereign states.
<br>
<br>"(17) The United States Government cooperates closely with Cyprus, Greece, and Israel through information sharing agreements.
<br>
<br>"(18) United States officials have assisted the Government of the Republic of Cyprus with crafting that nation's national security strategy.
<br>
<br>"(19) The United States Government provides training to Cypriot officials in areas such as cybersecurity, counterterrorism, and explosive ordnance disposal and stockpile management.
<br>
<br>"(20) Israel, Greece, and Cyprus are valued members of the Proliferation Security Initiative to combat the trafficking of weapons of mass destruction.
<br>
<br>"(21) The Republic of Cyprus continues to work closely with the United Nations and regional partners in Europe to combat terrorism and violent extremism.
<br>
<br>"(22) Despite robust economic and security relations with the United States, the Republic of Cyprus has been subject to a United States prohibition on the export of defense articles and services since 1987.
<br>
<br>"(23) The 1987 arms prohibition was designed to restrict United States arms sales and transfers to the Republic of Cyprus and the occupied part of Cyprus to avoid hindering reunification efforts.
<br>
<br>"(24) At least 40,000 Turkish troops are stationed in the occupied part of Cyprus with some weapons procured from the United States through mainland Turkey.
<br>
<br>"(25) While the United States has, as a matter of policy, avoided the provision of defense articles and services to the Republic of Cyprus, the Government of Cyprus has, in the past, sought to obtain defense articles from other countries, including countries, such as Russia, that pose challenges to United States interests around the world.
<br>"SEC. 203. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

<br>§2375. Assistance to Pakistan
<br>(a) Congressional policy, findings, and goals
<br>
<br>The Congress recognizes that Soviet forces occupying Afghanistan pose a security threat to Pakistan. The Congress also recognizes that an independent and democratic Pakistan with continued friendly ties with the United States is in the interest of both nations. The Congress finds that United States assistance will help Pakistan maintain its independence. Assistance to Pakistan is intended to benefit the people of Pakistan by helping them meet the burdens imposed by the presence of Soviet forces in Afghanistan and by promoting economic development. In authorizing assistance to Pakistan, it is the intent of Congress to promote the expeditious restoration of full civil liberties and representative government in Pakistan. The Congress further recognizes that it is in the mutual interest of Pakistan and the United States to avoid the profoundly destabilizing effects of the proliferation of nuclear explosive devices or the capacity to manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear devices.
<br>(b) Reaffirmation of 1959 bilateral agreement
<br>
<br>The United States reaffirms the commitment made in its 1959 bilateral agreement with Pakistan relating to aggression from a Communist or Communist-dominated state.
<br>(c) Availability; defensive aspects of assistance
<br>
<br>Security assistance for Pakistan shall be made available in order to assist Pakistan in dealing with the threat to its security posed by the Soviet presence in Afghanistan. The United States will take appropriate steps to ensure that defense articles provided by the United States to Pakistan are used for defensive purposes.
<br>(d) Waiver of limitations respecting nuclear transfers
<br>
<br>The President may waive the prohibitions of section 2799aa of this title with respect to any grounds for the prohibition of assistance under that section arising before the effective date of part B of the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994 to provide assistance to Pakistan if he determines that to do so is in the national interest of the United States.
<br>(e) Nuclear non-proliferation conditions on military assistance; exception
<br>
<br>(1) No military assistance shall be furnished to Pakistan and no military equipment or technology shall be sold or transferred to Pakistan, pursuant to the authorities contained in this chapter or any other Act, unless the President shall have certified in writing to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate, during the fiscal year in which military assistance is to be furnished or military equipment or technology is to be sold or transferred, that Pakistan does not possess a nuclear explosive device and that the proposed United States military assistance program will reduce significantly the risk that Pakistan will possess a nuclear explosive device.
<br>
<br>(2) The prohibitions in this section do not apply to any assistance or transfer provided for the purposes of:
<br>
<br>(A) International narcotics control (including part VIII of subchapter I of this chapter) or any provision of law available for providing assistance for counternarcotics purposes.
<br>
<br>(B) Facilitating military-to-military contact, training (including part V of subchapter II of this chapter) and humanitarian and civic assistance projects.
<br>
<br>(C) Peacekeeping and other multilateral operations (including part VI of subchapter II of this chapter relating to peacekeeping) or any provision of law available for providing assistance for peacekeeping purposes, except that lethal military equipment provided under this subparagraph shall be provided on a lease or loan basis only and shall be returned upon completion of the operation for which it was provided.
<br>
<br>(D) Antiterrorism assistance (including part VIII of subchapter II of this chapter relating to antiterrorism assistance) or any provision of law available for antiterrorism assistance purposes.
<br>
<br>(3) The restrictions of this subsection shall continue to apply to contracts for the delivery of F–16 aircraft to Pakistan.
<br>
<br>(4) Notwithstanding the restrictions contained in this subsection, military equipment, technology, or defense services, other than F–16 aircraft, may be transferred to Pakistan pursuant to contracts or cases entered into before October 1, 1990.
<br>(f) Storage costs
<br>
<br>The President may release the Government of Pakistan of its contractual obligation to pay the United States Government for the storage costs of items purchased prior to October 1, 1990, but not delivered by the United States Government pursuant to subsection (e) and may reimburse the Government of Pakistan for any such amount paid, on such terms and conditions as the President may prescribe: Provided, That such payments have no budgetary impact.
<br>(g) Inapplicability of restrictions to previously owned items
<br>
<br>Subsection (e) does not apply to broken, worn or unupgraded items or their equivalent which Pakistan paid for and took possession of prior to October 1, 1990 and which the Government of Pakistan sent to the United States for repair or upgrade. Such equipment or its equivalent may be returned to the Government of Pakistan: Provided, That the President determines and so certifies to the appropriate congressional committees that such equipment or equivalent neither constitutes nor has received any significant qualitative upgrade since being transferred to the United States and that its total value does not exceed $25,000,000.

<br>Strategy for the United States Relationship With Pakistan
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 110–53, title XX, §2042(a)–(f), Aug. 3, 2007, 121 Stat. 520–523, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(a) Congressional Findings.—Congress finds the following:
<br>
<br>"(1) A democratic, stable, and prosperous Pakistan that is a full and reliable partner in the struggle against the Taliban, al Qaeda, and other terrorist groups, and is a responsible steward of its nuclear weapons and technology, is vital to the national security of the United States.
<br>
<br>"(2) Since September 11, 2001, the Government of Pakistan has been a critical ally and an important partner in removing the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and combating al Qaeda.
<br>
<br>"(3) Pakistan has made great sacrifices in the shared struggle against al Qaeda-affiliated terrorist groups, engaging in military operations that have led to the deaths of hundreds of Pakistani security personnel and enduring acts of terrorism that have killed hundreds of Pakistani civilians.
<br>
<br>"(4) Publicly-stated goals of the Government of Pakistan and the national interests of the United States are in close agreement in many areas, including—
<br>
<br>"(A) curbing the proliferation of nuclear weapons technology;
<br>
<br>"(B) combating poverty and corruption;
<br>
<br>"(C) enabling effective government institutions, including public education;
<br>
<br>"(D) promoting democracy and the rule of law, particularly at the national level;
<br>
<br>"(E) addressing the continued presence of Taliban and other violent extremist forces throughout the country;
<br>
<br>"(F) maintaining the authority of the Government of Pakistan in all parts of its national territory;
<br>
<br>"(G) securing the borders of Pakistan to prevent the movement of militants and terrorists into other countries and territories; and
<br>
<br>"(H) effectively dealing with violent extremism.
<br>
<br>"(5) The opportunity exists for shared effort in helping to achieve correlative goals with the Government of Pakistan, particularly—
<br>
<br>"(A) increased United States assistance to Pakistan, as appropriate, to achieve progress in meeting the goals of subparagraphs (A) through (C) of paragraph (4);
<br>
<br>"(B) increased commitment on the part of the Government of Pakistan to achieve the goals of paragraph (4)(D), particularly given continued concerns, based on the conduct of previous elections, regarding whether parliamentary elections scheduled for 2007 will be free, fair, and inclusive of all political parties and carried out in full accordance with internationally-recognized democratic norms; and
<br>
<br>"(C) increased commitment on the part of the Government of Pakistan to take actions described in paragraph (4)(E), particularly given—
<br>
<br>"(i) the continued operation of the Taliban's Quetta shura, as noted by then-North Atlantic Treaty Organization Supreme Allied Commander General James Jones in testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on September 21, 2006; and
<br>
<br>"(ii) the continued operation of al Qaeda affiliates Lashkar-e Taiba and Jaish-e Muhammad, sometimes under different names, as demonstrated by the lack of meaningful action taken against Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, Maulana Masood Azhar, and other known leaders and members of such terrorist organizations; and
<br>
<br>"(D) increased commitment on the part of the Government of the United States in regard to working with all elements of Pakistan [sic] society in helping to achieve the correlative goals described in subparagraphs (A) through (H) of paragraph (4).
<br>
<br>"(b) Statements of Policy.—The following shall be the policy of the United States:
<br>
<br>"(1) To maintain and deepen its friendship and long-term strategic relationship with Pakistan.
<br>
<br>"(2) To work with the Government of Pakistan to combat international terrorism, especially in the frontier provinces of Pakistan, and to end the use of Pakistan as a safe haven for terrorist groups, including those associated with al Qaeda or the Taliban.
<br>
<br>"(3) To support robust funding for programs of the United States Agency for International Development and the Department of State that assist the Government of Pakistan in working toward the goals described in subsection (a)(4), as the Government of Pakistan demonstrates a clear commitment to building a moderate, democratic state.
<br>
<br>"(4) To work with the international community to secure additional financial and political support to effectively implement the policies set forth in this subsection.
<br>
<br>"(5) To facilitate a just resolution of the dispute over the territory of Kashmir, to the extent that such facilitation is invited and welcomed by the Governments of Pakistan and India and by the people of Kashmir.
<br>
<br>"(6) To facilitate greater communication and cooperation between the Governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan for the improvement of bilateral relations and cooperation in combating terrorism in both countries.
<br>
<br>"(7) To work with the Government of Pakistan to dismantle existing proliferation networks and prevent the proliferation of nuclear technology.
<br>
<br>"(c) Strategy Relating to Pakistan.—
<br>
<br>"(1) Requirement for report on strategy.—Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act [Aug. 3, 2007], the President shall transmit to the appropriate congressional committees a report that describes the long-term strategy of the United States to engage with the Government of Pakistan to achieve the goals described in subparagraphs (A) through (H) of subsection (a)(4) and to carry out the policies described in subsection (b).
<br>
<br>"(2) Form.—The report required by paragraph (1) shall be transmitted in unclassified form, but may include a classified annex, if necessary.
<br>
<br>"(d) Limitation on United States Security Assistance to Pakistan.—
<br>
<br>"(1) Limitation.—For fiscal year 2008, United States assistance under chapter 2 of part II of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2311 et seq.) or section 23 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2763) may not be provided to, and a license for any item controlled under the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.) may not be approved for, Pakistan until the President transmits to the appropriate congressional committees a report that contains a determination of the President that the Government of Pakistan—
<br>
<br>"(A) is committed to eliminating from Pakistani territory any organization such as the Taliban, al Qaeda, or any successor, engaged in military, insurgent, or terrorist activities in Afghanistan;
<br>
<br>"(B) is undertaking a comprehensive military, legal, economic, and political campaign to achieving the goal described in subparagraph (A); and
<br>
<br>"(C) is currently making demonstrated, significant, and sustained progress toward eliminating support or safe haven for terrorists.
<br>
<br>"(2) Memorandum of justification.—The President shall include in the report required by paragraph (1) a memorandum of justification setting forth the basis for the President's determination under paragraph (1).
<br>
<br>"(3) Form.—The report required by paragraph (1) and the memorandum of justification required by paragraph (2) shall be transmitted in unclassified form, but may include a classified annex, if necessary.
<br>
<br>"(e) Nuclear Proliferation.—
<br>
<br>"(1) Congressional finding.—Congress finds that the maintenance by any country of a procurement or supply network for the illicit proliferation of nuclear and missile technologies would be inconsistent with that country being considered an ally of the United States.
<br>
<br>"(2) Sense of congress.—It is the sense of Congress that the national security interest of the United States will best be served if the United States develops and implements a long-term strategy to improve the United States relationship with Pakistan and works with the Government of Pakistan to stop nuclear proliferation.
<br>
<br>"(f) Authorization of Appropriations.—
<br>
<br>"(1) In general.—There is authorized to be appropriated to the President such sums as may be necessary to provide assistance described in subsection (d)(1) for Pakistan for fiscal year 2008 in accordance with the requirements of subsection (d)(1).
<br>
<br>"(2) Other funds.—Amounts authorized to be appropriated under this subsection are in addition to amounts otherwise available for such purposes.
<br>
<br>"(3) Declaration of policy.—Congress declares that the amount of funds appropriated pursuant to the authorization of appropriations under paragraph (1) and for subsequent fiscal years shall be determined by the extent to which the Government of Pakistan displays demonstrable progress in—
<br>
<br>"(A) preventing al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations from operating in the territory of Pakistan, including eliminating terrorist training camps or facilities, arresting members and leaders of terrorist organizations, and countering recruitment efforts;
<br>
<br>"(B) preventing the Taliban from using the territory of Pakistan as a sanctuary from which to launch attacks within Afghanistan, including by arresting Taliban leaders, stopping cross-border incursions, and countering recruitment efforts; and
<br>
<br>"(C) implementing democratic reforms, including allowing free, fair, and inclusive elections at all levels of government in accordance with internationally-recognized democratic norms, and respecting the independence of the press and judiciary.
<br>
<br>"(4) Biannual reports to congress.—
<br>
<br>"(A) In general.—The Secretary of State shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a biannual report describing in detail the extent to which the Government of Pakistan has displayed demonstrable progress in meeting the goals described in subparagraphs (A) through (C) of paragraph (3).
<br>
<br>"(B) Schedule for submission.—The report required by subparagraph (A) shall be submitted not later than April 15 and October 15 of each year until October 15, 2009.
<br>
<br>"(C) Form.—The report required by subparagraph (A) shall be submitted in unclassified form, but may include a classified annex, if necessary."

<br>§2376. Nuclear non-proliferation policy in South Asia
<br>(a) Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction remains one of the most serious threats to international peace and stability;
<br>
<br>(2) South Asia, in particular, is an area where the threat of a regional nuclear exchange remains high due to continued Indo-Pakistani tensions over issues such as Kashmir;
<br>
<br>(3) to date, United States efforts to halt proliferation in South Asia have failed;
<br>
<br>(4) although global disarmament is a desirable goal which should be vigorously pursued, both regional and sub-regional security arrangements can serve to decrease tensions and promote non-proliferation in certain areas;
<br>
<br>(5) thus far, there has been some success on a regional basis, such as the South Pacific Nuclear Weapons Free Zone and the Treaty of Tlatelolco in Latin America;
<br>
<br>(6) in particular, in Latin America, the Treaty of Tlatelolco has been signed by all the nuclear powers;
<br>
<br>(7) a critical part of this treaty is Protocol II which prohibits nuclear attacks by nuclear weapons states on signatories to the treaty;
<br>
<br>(8) in 1991, a proposal was made for a regional conference on non-proliferation in South Asia which would include Pakistan, India, the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, and the United States; and
<br>
<br>(9) thus far, Pakistan, China, Russia, and the United States have expressed interest in attending such a conference, whereas India has refused to attend.
<br>(b) Policy
<br>
<br>It is the sense of the Congress that the President should pursue a policy which seeks a regional negotiated solution to the issue of nuclear non-proliferation in South Asia at the earliest possible time, including a protocol to be signed by all nuclear weapons states, prohibiting nuclear attacks by nuclear weapons states on countries in the region. Such a policy should have as its ultimate goal concurrent accession by Pakistan and India to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and should also include as needed a phased approach to that goal through a series of agreements among the parties on nuclear issues, such as the agreement reached by Pakistan and India not to attack one another's nuclear facilities.

<br>
<br>1998—Subsec. (c). Pub. L. 105–277, which directed the substitution of "Not later than April 1 of each year," for "Not later than April 1, 1993 and every six months thereafter," was executed by making the substitution for text which contained a comma after "1993" to reflect the probable intent of Congress.

<br>
<br>"(2) the President should continue to make efforts to counter international terrorism a national security priority;
<br>
<br>"(3) because the United Nations has been an inadequate forum for the discussion of cooperative, multilateral responses to the threat of international terrorism, the President should undertake immediate efforts to develop effective multilateral responses to international terrorism as a complement to national counter terrorist efforts;
<br>
<br>"(4) the President should use all necessary means, including covert action and military force, to disrupt, dismantle, and destroy international infrastructure used by international terrorists, including overseas terrorist training facilities and safe havens;
<br>
<br>"(5) the Congress deplores decisions to ease, evade, or end international sanctions on state sponsors of terrorism, including the recent decision by the United Nations Sanctions Committee to allow airline flights to and from Libya despite Libya's noncompliance with United Nations resolutions; and
<br>
