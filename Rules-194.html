<br>Executive Order No. 9845
<br>
<br>Ex. Ord. No. 9845, Apr. 28, 1947, 12 F.R. 2799, which permitted Bureau of Reclamation employees to accept appointments as constables or deputy sheriffs under state or territorial laws, was revoked by Ex. Ord. No. 11408, Apr. 25, 1968, 33 F.R. 6459.
<br>Ex. Ord. No. 12564. Drug-Free Federal Workplace
<br>
<br>Ex. Ord. No. 12564, Sept. 15, 1986, 51 F.R. 32889, provided:
<br>
<br>I, RONALD REAGAN, President of the United States of America, find that:
<br>
<br>Drug use is having serious adverse effects upon a significant proportion of the national work force and results in billions of dollars of lost productivity each year;
<br>
<br>The Federal government, as an employer, is concerned with the well-being of its employees, the successful accomplishment of agency missions, and the need to maintain employee productivity;
<br>
<br>The Federal government, as the largest employer in the Nation, can and should show the way towards achieving drug-free workplaces through a program designed to offer drug users a helping hand and, at the same time, demonstrating to drug users and potential drug users that drugs will not be tolerated in the Federal workplace;
<br>
<br>The profits from illegal drugs provide the single greatest source of income for organized crime, fuel violent street crime, and otherwise contribute to the breakdown of our society;
<br>
<br>The use of illegal drugs, on or off duty, by Federal employees is inconsistent not only with the law-abiding behavior expected of all citizens, but also with the special trust placed in such employees as servants of the public;
<br>
<br>Federal employees who use illegal drugs, on or off duty, tend to be less productive, less reliable, and prone to greater absenteeism than their fellow employees who do not use illegal drugs;
<br>
<br>The use of illegal drugs, on or off duty, by Federal employees impairs the efficiency of Federal departments and agencies, undermines public confidence in them, and makes it more difficult for other employees who do not use illegal drugs to perform their jobs effectively. The use of illegal drugs, on or off duty, by Federal employees also can pose a serious health and safety threat to members of the public and to other Federal employees;
<br>
<br>The use of illegal drugs, on or off duty, by Federal employees in certain positions evidences less than the complete reliability, stability, and good judgment that is consistent with access to sensitive information and creates the possibility of coercion, influence, and irresponsible action under pressure that may pose a serious risk to national security, the public safety, and the effective enforcement of the law; and
<br>
<br>Federal employees who use illegal drugs must themselves be primarily responsible for changing their behavior and, if necessary, begin the process of rehabilitating themselves.
<br>
<br>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America, including section 3301(2) of Title 5 of the United States Code, section 7301 of Title 5 of the United States Code, section 290ee–1 of Title 42 of the United States Code, deeming such action in the best interests of national security, public health and safety, law enforcement and the efficiency of the Federal service, and in order to establish standards and procedures to ensure fairness in achieving a drug-free Federal workplace and to protect the privacy of Federal employees, it is hereby ordered as follows:
<br>
<br>Section 1. Drug-Free Workplace. (a) Federal employees are required to refrain from the use of illegal drugs.
<br>
<br>(b) The use of illegal drugs by Federal employees, whether on duty or off duty, is contrary to the efficiency of the service.
<br>
<br>(c) Persons who use illegal drugs are not suitable for Federal employment.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. Agency Responsibilities. (a) The head of each Executive agency shall develop a plan for achieving the objective of a drug-free workplace with due consideration of the rights of the government, the employee, and the general public.
<br>
<br>(b) Each agency plan shall include:
<br>
<br>(1) A statement of policy setting forth the agency's expectations regarding drug use and the action to be anticipated in response to identified drug use;
<br>
<br>(2) Employee Assistance Programs emphasizing high level direction, education, counseling, referral to rehabilitation, and coordination with available community resources;
<br>
<br>(3) Supervisory training to assist in identifying and addressing illegal drug use by agency employees;
<br>
<br>(4) Provision for self-referrals as well as supervisory referrals to treatment with maximum respect for individual confidentiality consistent with safety and security issues; and
<br>
<br>(5) Provision for identifying illegal drug users, including testing on a controlled and carefully monitored basis in accordance with this Order.
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. Drug Testing Programs. (a) The head of each Executive agency shall establish a program to test for the use of illegal drugs by employees in sensitive positions. The extent to which such employees are tested and the criteria for such testing shall be determined by the head of each agency, based upon the nature of the agency's mission and its employees' duties, the efficient use of agency resources, and the danger to the public health and safety or national security that could result from the failure of an employee adequately to discharge his or her position.
<br>
<br>(b) The head of each Executive agency shall establish a program for voluntary employee drug testing.
<br>
<br>(c) In addition to the testing authorized in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the head of each Executive agency is authorized to test an employee for illegal drug use under the following circumstances:
<br>
<br>(1) When there is a reasonable suspicion that any employee uses illegal drugs;
<br>
<br>(2) In an examination authorized by the agency regarding an accident or unsafe practice; or
<br>
<br>(3) As part of or as a follow-up to counseling or rehabilitation for illegal drug use through an Employee Assistance Program.
<br>
<br>(d) The head of each Executive agency is authorized to test any applicant for illegal drug use.
<br>
<br>Sec. 4. Drug Testing Procedures. (a) Sixty days prior to the implementation of a drug testing program pursuant to this Order, agencies shall notify employees that testing for use of illegal drugs is to be conducted and that they may seek counseling and rehabilitation and inform them of the procedures for obtaining such assistance through the agency's Employee Assistance Program. Agency drug testing programs already ongoing are exempted from the 60-day notice requirement. Agencies may take action under section 3(c) of this Order without reference to the 60-day notice period.
<br>
<br>(b) Before conducting a drug test, the agency shall inform the employee to be tested of the opportunity to submit medical documentation that may support a legitimate use for a specific drug.
<br>
<br>(c) Drug testing programs shall contain procedures for timely submission of requests for retention of records and specimens; procedures for retesting; and procedures, consistent with applicable law, to protect the confidentiality of test results and related medical and rehabilitation records. Procedures for providing urine specimens must allow individual privacy, unless the agency has reason to believe that a particular individual may alter or substitute the specimen to be provided.
<br>
<br>(d) The Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized to promulgate scientific and technical guidelines for drug testing programs, and agencies shall conduct their drug testing programs in accordance with these guidelines once promulgated.
<br>
<br>Sec. 5. Personnel Actions. (a) Agencies shall, in addition to any appropriate personnel actions, refer any employee who is found to use illegal drugs to an Employee Assistance Program for assessment, counseling, and referral for treatment or rehabilitation as appropriate.
<br>
<br>(b) Agencies shall initiate action to discipline any employee who is found to use illegal drugs, provided that such action is not required for an employee who:
<br>
<br>(1) Voluntarily identifies himself as a user of illegal drugs or who volunteers for drug testing pursuant to section 3(b) of this Order, prior to being identified through other means;
<br>
<br>(2) Obtains counseling or rehabilitation through an Employee Assistance Program; and
<br>
<br>(3) Thereafter refrains from using illegal drugs.
<br>
<br>(c) Agencies shall not allow any employee to remain on duty in a sensitive position who is found to use illegal drugs, prior to successful completion of rehabilitation through an Employee Assistance Program. However, as part of a rehabilitation or counseling program, the head of an Executive agency may, in his or her discretion, allow an employee to return to duty in a sensitive position if it is determined that this action would not pose a danger to public health or safety or the national security.
<br>
<br>(d) Agencies shall initiate action to remove from the service any employee who is found to use illegal drugs and:
<br>
<br>(1) Refuses to obtain counseling or rehabilitation through an Employee Assistance Program; or
<br>
<br>(2) Does not thereafter refrain from using illegal drugs.
<br>
<br>(e) The results of a drug test and information developed by the agency in the course of the drug testing of the employee may be considered in processing any adverse action against the employee or for other administrative purposes. Preliminary test results may not be used in an administrative proceeding unless they are confirmed by a second analysis of the same sample or unless the employee confirms the accuracy of the initial test by admitting the use of illegal drugs.
<br>
<br>(f) The determination of an agency that an employee uses illegal drugs can be made on the basis of any appropriate evidence, including direct observation, a criminal conviction, administrative inquiry, or the results of an authorized testing program. Positive drug test results may be rebutted by other evidence that an employee has not used illegal drugs.
<br>
<br>(g) Any action to discipline an employee who is using illegal drugs (including removal from the service, if appropriate) shall be taken in compliance with otherwise applicable procedures, including the Civil Service Reform Act [Pub. L. 95–454, see Tables for classification].
<br>
<br>(h) Drug testing shall not be conducted pursuant to this Order for the purpose of gathering evidence for use in criminal proceedings. Agencies are not required to report to the Attorney General for investigation or prosecution any information, allegation, or evidence relating to violations of Title 21 of the United States Code received as a result of the operation of drug testing programs established pursuant to this Order.
<br>
<br>Sec. 6. Coordination of Agency Programs. (a) The Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall:
<br>
<br>(1) Issue government-wide guidance to agencies on the implementation of the terms of this Order;
<br>
<br>(2) Ensure that appropriate coverage for drug abuse is maintained for employees and their families under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program;
<br>
<br>(3) Develop a model Employee Assistance Program for Federal agencies and assist the agencies in putting programs in place;
<br>
<br>(4) In consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, develop and improve training programs for Federal supervisors and managers on illegal drug use; and
<br>
<br>(5) In cooperation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and heads of Executive agencies, mount an intensive drug awareness campaign throughout the Federal work force.
<br>
<br>(b) The Attorney General shall render legal advice regarding the implementation of this Order and shall be consulted with regard to all guidelines, regulations, and policies proposed to be adopted pursuant to this Order.
<br>
<br>(c) Nothing in this Order shall be deemed to limit the authorities of the Director of Central Intelligence under the National Security Act of 1947, as amended [50 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.], or the statutory authorities of the National Security Agency or the Defense Intelligence Agency. Implementation of this Order within the Intelligence Community, as defined in Executive Order No. 12333 [50 U.S.C. 3001 note], shall be subject to the approval of the head of the affected agency.

<br>
<br>(m) Employees shall adhere to all laws and regulations that provide equal opportunity for all Americans regardless of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or handicap.
<br>
<br>(n) Employees shall endeavor to avoid any actions creating the appearance that they are violating the law or the ethical standards promulgated pursuant to this order.
<br>
<br>Sec. 102. Limitations on Outside Earned Income.
<br>

<br>
<br>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America and in order to protect Federal Government employees and members of the public from exposure to tobacco smoke in the Federal workplace, it is hereby ordered as follows:

<br>
<br>Sec. 2. Exceptions. The general policy established by this order is subject to the following exceptions: (a) The order does not apply in designated smoking areas that are enclosed and exhausted directly to the outside and away from air intake ducts, and are maintained under negative pressure (with respect to surrounding spaces) sufficient to contain tobacco smoke within the designated area. Agency officials shall not require workers to enter such areas during business hours while smoking is ongoing.

<br>(d) The order does not extend to places of employment in the private sector or in other nonfederal governmental units that serve as the permanent or intermittent duty station of one or more Federal employees.
<br>
<br>(e) The head of any agency may establish limited and narrow exceptions that are necessary to accomplish agency missions. Such exception shall be in writing, approved by the agency head, and to the fullest extent possible provide protection of nonsmokers from exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Authority to establish such exceptions may not be delegated.
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. Other Locations. The heads of agencies shall evaluate the need to restrict smoking at doorways and in courtyards under executive branch control in order to protect workers and visitors from environmental tobacco smoke, and may restrict smoking in these areas in light of this evaluation.

This 1 year phase-in period is designed to establish a fixed but reasonable time for implementing this policy. Agency heads are directed during this period to inform all employees and visitors to executive branch facilities about the requirements of this order, inform their employees of the health risks of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, and undertake related activities as necessary.
<br>
<br>Sec. 7. Consistency with Other Laws.

Nothing herein shall be construed to replace any agency policy currently in effect, if such policy is legally established, in writing, and consistent with the terms of this order. Agencies shall review their current policy to confirm that agency policy comports with this order, and policy found not in compliance shall be revised to comply with the terms of this order.
<br>
<br>Sec. 8. Cause of Action. This order does not create any right to administrative or judicial review, or any other right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable by a party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person or affect in any way the liability of the executive branch under the Federal Tort Claims Act [see Short Title note set out under section 2671 of Title 28, Judiciary and Judicial Procedure].

<br>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 1104(a)(1), 3301, and 7301 of title 5, United States Code, and in order to simplify and streamline the system of Federal Government personnel investigative and adjudicative processes to make them more efficient and effective, it is hereby ordered as follows:

<br>
<br>Sec. 2. [Definitions. For the purposes of this order:]

<br>
<br>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including section 301 of title 3, United States Code, I hereby delegate to you the functions and authority conferred upon the President by section 7301 of title 5, United States Code, with respect to providing appropriate workplace accommodations for executive branch civilian employees who are nursing mothers.

<br>Establishing Policies for Addressing Domestic Violence in the Federal Workforce
<br>
<br>Memorandum of President of the United States, Apr. 18, 2012, 77 F.R. 24339, provided:
<br>
<br>Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
<br>
<br>Despite the considerable progress made since the initial passage of the Violence Against Women Act in 1994 ([title IV of] Public Law 103–322), domestic violence remains a significant problem facing individuals, families, and communities. Domestic violence causes two million injuries each year, and an average of three women in the United States die each day as a result of domestic violence. While a disproportionate number of victims are women, domestic violence can affect anyone.
<br>
<br>The effects of domestic violence spill over into the workplace. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that domestic violence costs our Nation $8 billion a year in lost productivity and health care costs alone, and other studies have suggested that the full economic impact is even higher. Moreover, many victims of domestic violence report being harassed in the workplace or experiencing other employment-related effects.
<br>
<br>As the Nation's largest employer, the Federal Government should act as a model in responding to the effects of domestic violence on its workforce. Executive departments and agencies (agencies) have taken steps to address this issue, including by enhancing the quality and effectiveness of security in Federal facilities and by linking victims of domestic violence with Employee Assistance Programs. By building on these important efforts and existing policies, the Federal Government can further address the effects of domestic violence on its workforce.
<br>
<br>It is the policy of the Federal Government to promote the health and safety of its employees by acting to prevent domestic violence within the workplace and by providing support and assistance to Federal employees whose working lives are affected by such violence. Therefore, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct the following:
<br>
<br>Section 1. Government-wide Guidance to Address the Effects of Domestic Violence on the Federal Workforce. Within 240 days of the date of this memorandum, the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) shall, in consultation with the Attorney General, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and other interested heads of agencies:
<br>
<br>(a) issue guidance to agencies on the content of agency-specific policies, as required by section 2 of this memorandum, to prevent domestic violence and address its effects on the Federal workforce. The guidance shall include recommended steps agencies can take as employers for early intervention in and prevention of domestic violence committed against or by employees, guidelines for assisting employee victims, leave policies relating to domestic violence situations, general guidelines on when it may be appropriate to take disciplinary action against employees who commit or threaten acts of domestic violence, measures to improve workplace safety related to domestic violence, and resources for identifying relevant best practices related to domestic violence;
<br>
<br>(b) establish a process for providing technical assistance to agencies in developing agency-specific policies, consistent with the guidance created pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, that meet the needs of their workforce; and
<br>
<br>(c) consider whether issuing further guidance is warranted with respect to sexual assault and stalking and, if so, issue such guidance.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. Agency-Specific Actions and Policies. (a) Within 90 days from the date of this memorandum, each agency shall make available to the Director of OPM any existing agency-specific policies and practices for addressing the effects of domestic violence on its workforce.
<br>
<br>(b) Within 120 days from the issuance of the guidance created pursuant to section 1 of this memorandum, each agency shall develop or modify, as appropriate, agency-specific polices for addressing the effects of domestic violence on its workforce, consistent with OPM guidance. Each agency shall submit for review and comment to the Director of OPM, a draft new or modified agency-specific policy. In reviewing the draft agency-specific policies, the Director of OPM shall consult with the Attorney General, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and other interested agency heads. Each agency shall issue a final agency-specific policy within 180 days after submission of its draft policy to the Director of OPM.
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
<br>
<br>(i) the authority granted by law to an agency, or the head thereof; or
<br>
<br>(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
<br>
<br>(b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
<br>
<br>(c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
<br>
<br>The Director of OPM is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.
<br>
<br>Barack Obama.      
<br>§7302. Post-employment notification
<br>
<br>(a) Not later than the effective date of the amendments made by section 1106 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004,1 or 180 days after the date of the enactment of that Act, whichever is later, the Office of Personnel Management shall, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Office of Government Ethics, promulgate regulations requiring that each Executive branch agency notify any employee of that agency who is subject to the provisions of section 207(c)(1) of title 18, as a result of the amendment to section 207(c)(2)(A)(ii) of that title by that Act.
<br>
<br>(b) The regulations shall require that notice be given before, or as part of, the action that affects the employee's coverage under section 207(c)(1) of title 18, by virtue of the provisions of section 207(c)(2)(A)(ii) of that title, and again when employment or service in the covered position is terminated.

<br>References in Text
<br>
<br>The effective date of the amendments made by section 1106 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, referred to in subsec. (a), probably means the effective date of the amendments made by section 1125 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, Pub. L. 108–136, which enacted this section. Pub. L. 108–136 does not contain a section 1106, and the provisions appearing in section 1106 of H.R. 1588, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, as passed by the House of Representatives on May 22, 2003, were contained in section 1125 of Pub. L. 108–136. For effective date of amendments made by section 1125 of Pub. L. 108–136, see section 1125(c) of Pub. L. 108–136, set out as an Effective Date of 2003 Amendment note under section 5304 of this title.
<br>
<br>The date of the enactment of that Act, referred to in subsec. (a), is the date of enactment of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, Pub. L. 108–136, which was approved Nov. 24, 2003.
