<br>§3101. Congressional findings
<br>
<br>(a) The Congress finds that the Nation has suffered substantial unemployment and underemployment, idleness of other productive resources, high rates of inflation, and inadequate productivity growth, over prolonged periods of time, imposing numerous economic and social costs on the Nation. Such costs include the following:
<br>
<br>(1) The Nation is deprived of the full supply of goods and services, the full utilization of labor and capital resources, and the related increases in economic well-being that would occur under conditions of genuine full employment, production, and real income, balanced growth, a balanced Federal budget, and the effective control of inflation.
<br>
<br>(2) The output of goods and services is insufficient to meet pressing national priorities.
<br>
<br>(3) Workers are deprived of the job security, income, skill development, and productivity necessary to maintain and advance their standards of living.
<br>
<br>(4) Business and industry are deprived of the production, sales, capital flow, and productivity necessary to maintain adequate profits, undertake new investment, create jobs, compete internationally, and contribute to meeting society's economic needs. These problems are especially acute for smaller businesses. Variations in the business cycle and low-level operations of the economy are far more damaging to smaller businesses than to larger business concerns because smaller businesses have fewer available resources, and less access to resources, to withstand nationwide economic adversity. A decline in small business enterprises contributes to unemployment by reducing employment opportunities and contributes to inflation by reducing competition.
<br>
<br>(5) Unemployment exposes many families to social, psychological, and physiological costs, including disruption of family life, loss of individual dignity and self-respect, and the aggravation of physical and psychological illnesses, alcoholism and drug abuse, crime, and social conflicts.
<br>
<br>(6) Federal, State, and local government budgets are undermined by deficits due to shortfalls in tax revenues and in increases in expenditures for unemployment compensation, public assistance, and other recession-related services in the areas of criminal justice, alcoholism and drug abuse, and physical and mental health.
<br>
<br>(b) The Congress further finds that:
<br>
<br>(1) High unemployment may contribute to inflation by diminishing labor training and skills, underutilizing capital resources, reducing the rate of productivity advance, increasing unit labor costs, and reducing the general supply of goods and services.
<br>
<br>(2) Aggregate monetary and fiscal policies alone have been unable to achieve full employment and production, increased real income, balanced growth, a balanced Federal budget, adequate productivity growth, proper attention to national priorities, achievement of an improved trade balance, and reasonable price stability, and therefore must be supplemented by other measures designed to serve these ends.
<br>
<br>(3) Attainment of these objectives should be facilitated by setting explicit short-term and medium-term economic goals, and by improved coordination among the President, the Congress, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
<br>
<br>(4) Increasing job opportunities and full employment would greatly contribute to the elimination of discrimination based upon sex, age, race, color, religion, national origin, handicap, or other improper factors.
<br>
<br>(c) The Congress further finds that an effective policy to promote full employment and production, increased real income, balanced growth, a balanced Federal budget, adequate productivity growth, proper attention to national priorities, achievement of an improved trade balance, and reasonable price stability should (1) be based on the development of explicit economic goals and policies involving the President, the Congress, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, with maximum reliance on the resources and ingenuity of the private sector of the economy, (2) include programs specifically designed to reduce high unemployment due to recessions, and to reduce structural unemployment within regional areas and among particular labor force groups, and (3) give proper attention to the role of increased exports and improvement in the international competitiveness of agriculture, business, and industry in providing productive employment opportunities and achieving an improved trade balance.
<br>
<br>(d) The Congress further finds that full employment and production, increased real income, balanced growth, a balanced Federal budget, adequate productivity growth, proper attention to national priorities, achievement of an improved trade balance through increased exports and improvement in the international competitiveness of agriculture, business, and industry, and reasonable price stability are important national requirements and will promote the economic security and well-being of all citizens of the Nation.
<br>
<br>(e) The Congress further finds that the United States is part of an interdependent world trading and monetary system and that attainment of the requirements specified in subsection (d) is dependent upon policies promoting a free and fair international trading system and a sound and stable international monetary system.

<br>§3103. National Employment Conference
<br>(a) Organization and implementation
<br>
<br>A National Employment Conference may be convened in the District of Columbia within a reasonable period of time after October 27, 1978. Responsibility for the organization and implementation of this conference shall rest with the President or the appropriate department or agency of the Federal Government, and the conference shall bring together leaders of small and larger business, labor, government, and all other interested parties.
<br>(b) Subject matter
<br>
<br>The subject of the conference shall be employment, with particular attention to structural unemployment and the plight of disadvantaged youth. The conference shall also focus on issues such as implementation of adequate and effective incentives for private sector employers to hire the hard-core unemployed. Special attention shall be given to the creation of jobs through the use of targeted employment tax credits, wage vouchers, and other incentives to private sector businesses.

<br>SUBCHAPTER I—STRUCTURAL ECONOMIC POLICIES AND PROGRAMS INCLUDING TREATMENT OF RESOURCE RESTRAINTS
<br>§3111. Congressional statement of purpose
<br>
<br>The Congress recognizes that general economic policies alone have been unable to achieve the goals set forth in this chapter related to full employment, production, and real income, balanced growth, adequate growth in productivity, proper attention to national priorities, achievement of an improved trade balance through increased exports and improvement in the international competitiveness of agriculture, business, and industry, and achievement of reasonable price stability as provided for in section 1022b(b) of this title. It is, therefore, the purpose of this subchapter to require the President to initiate, as the President deems appropriate, with recommendations to the Congress where necessary, supplementary programs and policies to the extent that the President finds such action necessary to help achieve these goals, including the goals and timetable for the reduction of unemployment. Insofar as feasible without undue delay, any policies and programs so recommended shall be included in the Economic Report.

<br>§3112. Countercyclical employment policies
<br>(a) Programmatic entities
<br>
<br>Any countercyclical efforts undertaken to aid in achieving the purposes of section 3111 of this title shall consider for inclusion the following programmatic entities:
<br>
<br>(1) accelerated public works, including the development of standby public works projects;
<br>
<br>(2) public service employment;
<br>
<br>(3) State and local grant programs;
<br>
<br>(4) the levels and duration of unemployment insurance;
<br>
<br>(5) skill training in both the private and public sectors, both as a general remedy and as a supplement to unemployment insurance;
<br>
<br>(6) youth employment programs as specified in section 3115 of this title;
<br>
<br>(7) community development programs to provide employment in activities of value to the States, local communities (including rural areas), and the Nation;
<br>
<br>(8) Federal procurement programs which are targeted on labor surplus areas; and
<br>
<br>(9) augmentation of other employment and training programs which would help to reduce high levels of unemployment arising from cyclical causes.
<br>(b) Triggering mechanism
<br>
<br>In any countercyclical efforts undertaken, the President shall consider a triggering mechanism which will implement the program during a period of rising unemployment and phase out the program when unemployment is appropriately reduced, and incorporate effective means to facilitate individuals assisted under programs developed pursuant to this section to return promptly to regular private and public employment as the economy recovers.

<br>§3113. Economic activity coordination
<br>(a) Federal, regional, State, local, and private sector
<br>
<br>As an integral part of any countercyclical employment policies undertaken in accord with section 3112 of this title, the President shall, to the extent the President deems necessary, set forth programs and policies, including recommended legislation where needed, to coordinate economic action among the Federal Government, regions, States and localities, and the private sector to promote achievement of the purposes of this chapter and the Employment Act of 1946 [15 U.S.C. 1021 et seq.] and an economic environment in which State and local governments and private sector economic activity and employment will prosper. In considering programs and policies related to the private sector, full consideration shall be given to promoting the growth and well-being of small businesses and employment training programs through private sector incentives.
<br>(b) Fiscal needs and budget conditions
<br>
<br>In any efforts under this section, the President shall endeavor to meet criteria that establish programs which are funded to take account of the fiscal needs and budget conditions of the respective States and localities and their own efforts, with special attention to the rates of unemployment in such States and localities.

<br>
<br>In formulating the regional components of any such programs, the President shall encourage to the extent the President deems necessary, new private sector production and employment to locate within depressed localities and regions with substantial unemployment and to aid in stabilizing their economic base.

<br>§3115. Youth employment policies and programs
<br>(a) Congressional findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds and declares—
<br>
<br>(1) That 1 serious unemployment and economic disadvantage of a unique nature exist among youths even under generally favorable economic conditions;
<br>

<br>
<br>(3) that many youths have special employment needs and problems which, if not promptly addressed, will substantially contribute to more severe unemployment problems in the long run.
<br>(b) Improvement and expansion
<br>
<br>To the extent deemed necessary in fulfillment of the purposes of this chapter, the President shall improve and expand existing youth employment programs, recommending legislation where required. In formulating any such program, the President shall—
<br>
<br>(1) include provisions designed to fully coordinate youth employment activities with other employment and training programs;
<br>
<br>(2) develop a smoother transition from school to work;
<br>
<br>(3) prepare disadvantaged and other youths with employability handicaps for regular self-sustaining employment;
<br>
<br>(4) develop realistic methods for combining training with work; and
<br>
<br>(5) develop provisions designed to attract structurally unemployed youth into productive full-time employment through incentives to private and independent sector businesses; 2

<br>
<br>(2) refer persons able, willing, and seeking to work to job opportunities in the private and public sectors through the existing public employment placement facilities and through the United States Employment Service of the Department of Labor, including job opportunities in any positions created under programs established pursuant to sections 3112, 3114, and 3115 of this title; and
<br>
<br>(3) encourage flexi-time and part-time jobs for persons who are able, willing, and seeking employment but who are unable to work a standard workweek.
<br>(c) Establishment of project reservoirs; restrictions and requirements of new programs
<br>
<br>(1) To the extent that individuals aged sixteen and over and able, willing, and seeking to work are not and in the judgment of the President cannot be provided with private job opportunities or job opportunities under other programs and actions in existence, in accord with the goals and timetables set forth in the Employment Act of 1946 [15 U.S.C. 1021 et seq.], the President shall, as may be authorized by law, establish reservoirs of public employment and private nonprofit employment projects, to be approved by the Secretary of Labor, through expansion of activities under title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act [29 U.S.C. 3111 et seq.] and other existing employment and training projects or through such new programs as are determined necessary by the President or through both such projects and such programs.
<br>
<br>(2) New programs as may be authorized by law after October 27, 1978, referred to in paragraph (c)(1)—
<br>
<br>(A) shall not be put into operation earlier than two years after October 27, 1978, nor without a finding by the President, transmitted to the Congress, that other means of employment are not yielding enough jobs to be consistent with attainment of the goals and timetables for the reduction of unemployment set forth in the Employment Act of 1946 [15 U.S.C. 1021 et seq.];
<br>
<br>(B) shall be designed so that no workers from private employment are drawn into the reservoir projects thereunder;
<br>
<br>(C) shall be useful and productive jobs;
<br>
<br>(D) shall be mainly in the lower ranges of skills and pay, and toward this end the number of reservoir jobs under such new programs shall, to the extent practicable, be maximized in relationship to the appropriations provided for such jobs;
<br>
<br>(E) shall be targeted on areas of high unemployment and on individuals who are structurally unemployed;
<br>
<br>(F) shall be phased in by the President as necessary, in conjunction with the employment goals under sections 3(a)(2) and 4(b) of the Employment Act of 1946 [15 U.S.C. 1022(a)(2), 1022a(b)].
<br>(d) Regulations
<br>
<br>The Secretary, in carrying out the provisions of this section, shall establish regulations providing for—
<br>
<br>(1) an initial determination of the job seeker's ability to be employed at certain types and duration of work, so that such individual may be appropriately referred to jobs, training, counseling, and other supportive services;
<br>
<br>(2) compliance with the nondiscrimination provisions of this chapter in accordance with section 3151 of this title;
<br>
<br>(3) appropriate eligibility criteria to determine the order of priority of access of any person to any new programs under subsection (c) as may be authorized by law including but not necessarily limited to (A) household income, duration of unemployment (not less than five weeks), and the number of people economically dependent upon such person; and (B) denial of access to any person refusing to accept or hold a job except for good cause, as determined by the Secretary of Labor, including refusal to accept or hold a job subject to reference under subsection (b) paragraph (2), in order to seek a reservoir project job under subsection (c); and

<br>§3117. Capital formation
<br>(a) Congressional findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) promotion of full employment and balanced growth is in itself a principal avenue to high and sustained rates of capital formation;
<br>
<br>(2) high rates of capital formation are necessary to ensure adequate rates of capacity expansion and productivity growth, compliance with governmental health, safety and environmental standards, and the replacement of obsolete production equipment;
<br>
<br>(3) the ability of our economy to compete successfully in international markets, the development of new technology, improved working conditions, expanding job opportunities, and an increasing standard of living depend on the availability of adequate capital at reasonable cost to commerce and industry;
<br>
<br>(4) an important goal of national policy shall be to remove obstacles to the free flow of resources into new investment, particularly those obstacles that hinder the creation and growth of smaller businesses because general national programs and policies to aid and stimulate private enterprise are not sufficient to deal with the special problems and needs of smaller businesses; and
<br>
<br>(5) while private business firms are, and should continue to be, the major source of investment, the investment activities of the Federal, State, and local governments play an important role in affecting the level of output, employment, and productivity and in achieving other national purposes.
<br>(b) Investment Policy Report; recommendations in President's Budget; referral to Joint Economic Committee
<br>
<br>The Economic Report shall include an Investment Policy Report which shall, as appropriate, (1) review and assess existing Federal Government programs and policies which affect business investment decisions, including, but not limited to, the relevant aspects of the tax code, Federal expenditure policy, Federal regulatory policy, international trade policy, and Federal support for research, development, and diffusion of new technologies; (2) provide an assessment of the levels of investment capital available, required by, and applied to small, medium and large business entities; (3) provide an analysis of current foreseeable trends in the level of investment capital available to such entities; and (4) provide a description of programs and proposals for carrying out the policy set forth in section 1021(i) of this title. In addition, the Economic Report shall include an assessment of the effect of the overall economic policy environment and the rate of inflation on business investment. The President shall recommend in the President's Budget, as appropriate, new programs or modifications to improve existing programs concerned with private capital formation. The President shall also transmit to the Congress as part of the President's Budget such other recommendations as the President may deem necessary or desirable to achieve the policy as set forth in section 1021(i) of this title. The Investment Policy Report, when transmitted to the Congress, shall be referred to the Joint Economic Committee.
<br>(c) Review in Economic Report of Federal policies and programs which affect public investments; recommendations respecting new policies or programs
<br>
<br>The Economic Report referred to in subsection (b) shall review and assess Federal policies and programs which directly, or through grants-in-aid to State and local governments, or indirectly through other means, affect the adequacy, composition and effectiveness of public investments, as a means of achieving the goals of this chapter and the Employment Act of 1946 [15 U.S.C. 1021 et seq.]. The President shall recommend, as appropriate, new programs and policies or modifications to improve existing Federal programs affecting public investment.

<br>
<br>(2) The term "gas utility" means any person, State agency, or Federal agency, engaged in the local distribution of natural gas, and the sale of natural gas to any ultimate consumer of natural gas.
<br>
<br>(3) The term "State regulated gas utility" means any gas utility with respect to which a State regulatory authority has ratemaking authority.
<br>
<br>(4) The term "nonregulated gas utility" means any gas utility other than a State regulated gas utility.
<br>
<br>(5) The term "rate" means any (A) price, rate, charge, or classification made, demanded, observed, or received with respect to sale of natural gas to a gas consumer, (B) any rule, regulation, or practice respecting any such rate, charge, or classification, and (C) any contract pertaining to the sale of natural gas to a gas consumer.

<br>Additional Definitions
<br>
<br>Except as otherwise specifically provided, the definitions in section 2602 of Title 16, Conservation, apply to this chapter.
<br>§3203. Adoption of certain standards
<br>(a) Adoption of standards
<br>
<br>Not later than 2 years after November 9, 1978 (or after October 24, 1992, in the case of standards under paragraphs (3),1 and (4) of subsection (b)), each State regulatory authority (with respect to each gas utility for which it has ratemaking authority) and each nonregulated gas utility shall provide public notice and conduct a hearing respecting the standards established by subsection (b), and, on the basis of such hearing, shall—
<br>
<br>(1) adopt the standard established by subsection (b)(1), if, and to the extent, such authority or nonregulated utility determines that such adoption is appropriate and is consistent with otherwise applicable State law, and
<br>
<br>(2) adopt the standards established by paragraphs (2), (3) 2 (4), (5), and (6) of subsection (b), if, and to the extent, such authority or nonregulated utility determines that such adoption is appropriate to carry out the purposes of this chapter, is otherwise appropriate, and is consistent with otherwise applicable State law.
<br>
<br>For purposes of any determination under paragraphs (1) and (2) and any review of such determination in any court under section 3207 of this title, the purposes of this chapter supplement State law. Nothing in this subsection prohibits any State regulatory authority or nonregulated utility from making any determination that it is not appropriate to implement any such standard, pursuant to its authority under otherwise applicable State law.
<br>(b) Establishment
<br>
<br>The following Federal standards are hereby established:
<br>(1) Procedures for termination of natural gas service
<br>
<br>No gas utility may terminate natural gas service to any gas consumer except pursuant to procedures described in section 3204(a) of this title.
<br>(2) Advertising
<br>
<br>No gas utility may recover from any person other than the shareholders (or other owners) of such utility any direct or indirect expenditure by such utility for promotional or political advertising as defined in section 3204(b) of this title.
<br>(3) Integrated resource planning
<br>
<br>Each gas utility shall employ, in order to provide adequate and reliable service to its gas customers at the lowest system cost. All plans or filings of a State regulated gas utility before a State regulatory authority to meet the requirements of this paragraph shall (A) be updated on a regular basis, (B) provide the opportunity for public participation and comment, (C) provide for methods of validating predicted performance, and (D) contain a requirement that the plan be implemented after approval of the State regulatory authority. Subsection (c) shall not apply to this paragraph to the extent that it could be construed to require the State regulatory authority to extend the record of a State proceeding in submitting reports to the Federal Government.
<br>(4) Investments in conservation and demand management
<br>
<br>The rates charged by any State regulated gas utility shall be such that the utility's prudent investments in, and expenditures for, energy conservation and load shifting programs and for other demand-side management measures which are consistent with the findings and purposes of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 are at least as profitable (taking into account the income lost due to reduced sales resulting from such programs) as prudent investments in, and expenditures for, the acquisition or construction of supplies and facilities. This objective requires that (A) regulators link the utility's net revenues, at least in part, to the utility's performance in implementing cost-effective programs promoted by this section; and (B) regulators ensure that, for purposes of recovering fixed costs, including its authorized return, the utility's performance is not affected by reductions in its retail sales volumes.
<br>(5) Energy efficiency
<br>
<br>Each natural gas utility shall—
<br>
<br>(A) integrate energy efficiency resources into the plans and planning processes of the natural gas utility; and
<br>
<br>(B) adopt policies that establish energy efficiency as a priority resource in the plans and planning processes of the natural gas utility.
<br>(6) Rate design modifications to promote energy efficiency investments
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The rates allowed to be charged by a natural gas utility shall align utility incentives with the deployment of cost-effective energy efficiency.
<br>(B) Policy options
<br>
<br>In complying with subparagraph (A), each State regulatory authority and each nonregulated utility shall consider—
<br>
<br>(i) separating fixed-cost revenue recovery from the volume of transportation or sales service provided to the customer;
<br>
<br>(ii) providing to utilities incentives for the successful management of energy efficiency programs, such as allowing utilities to retain a portion of the cost-reducing benefits accruing from the programs;
<br>
<br>(iii) promoting the impact on adoption of energy efficiency as 1 of the goals of retail rate design, recognizing that energy efficiency must be balanced with other objectives; and
<br>
<br>(iv) adopting rate designs that encourage energy efficiency for each customer class.
<br>
<br>For purposes of applying the provisions of this chapter 3 to this paragraph, any reference in this chapter 3 to November 9, 1978, shall be treated as a reference to December 19, 2007.
<br>(c) Procedural requirements
<br>
<br>Each State regulatory authority (with respect to each gas utility for which it has ratemaking authority) and each nonregulated gas utility, within the 2-year period specified in subsection (a), shall adopt, pursuant to subsection (a), each of the standards established by subsection (b), or, with respect to any such standard which is not adopted, such authority or nonregulated gas utility shall state in writing that it has determined not to adopt such standard, together with the reasons for such determination. Such statement of reasons shall be available to the public.
<br>(d) Small business impacts
<br>
<br>If a State regulatory authority implements a standard established by subsection (b)(3) or (4), such authority shall—
<br>
<br>(1) consider the impact that implementation of such standard would have on small businesses engaged in the design, sale, supply, installation, or servicing of energy conservation, energy efficiency, or other demand-side management measures, and
<br>
<br>(2) implement such standard so as to assure that utility actions would not provide such utilities with unfair competitive advantages over such small businesses.

<br>
<br>(2) during any period when termination of service to a gas consumer would be especially dangerous to health, as determined by the State regulatory authority (with respect to each gas utility for which it has ratemaking authority) or nonregulated gas utility, and such consumer establishes that—
<br>
<br>(A) he is unable to pay for such service in accordance with the requirements of the utility's billing, or
<br>
<br>(B) he is able to pay for such service but only in installments,
<br>
<br>such service may not be terminated.
