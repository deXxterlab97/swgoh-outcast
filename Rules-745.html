<br>§2056. Consumer product safety standards
<br>(a) Types of requirements
<br>
<br>The Commission may promulgate consumer product safety standards in accordance with the provisions of section 2058 of this title. A consumer product safety standard shall consist of one or more of any of the following types of requirements:
<br>
<br>(1) Requirements expressed in terms of performance requirements.
<br>
<br>(2) Requirements that a consumer product be marked with or accompanied by clear and adequate warnings or instructions, or requirements respecting the form of warnings or instructions.
<br>
<br>Any requirement of such a standard shall be reasonably necessary to prevent or reduce an unreasonable risk of injury associated with such product.
<br>(b) Reliance of Commission upon voluntary standards
<br>
<br>(1) The Commission shall rely upon voluntary consumer product safety standards rather than promulgate a consumer product safety standard prescribing requirements described in subsection (a) whenever compliance with such voluntary standards would eliminate or adequately reduce the risk of injury addressed and it is likely that there will be substantial compliance with such voluntary standards.
<br>
<br>(2) The Commission shall devise procedures to monitor compliance with any voluntary standards—
<br>
<br>(A) upon which the Commission has relied under paragraph (1);
<br>
<br>(B) which were developed with the participation of the Commission; or
<br>
<br>(C) whose development the Commission has monitored.
<br>(c) Contribution of Commission to development cost
<br>
<br>If any person participates with the Commission in the development of a consumer product safety standard, the Commission may agree to contribute to the person's cost with respect to such participation, in any case in which the Commission determines that such contribution is likely to result in a more satisfactory standard than would be developed without such contribution, and that the person is financially responsible. Regulations of the Commission shall set forth the items of cost in which it may participate, and shall exclude any contribution to the acquisition of land or buildings. Payments under agreements entered into under this subsection may be made without regard to section 3324(a) and (b) of title 31.

<br>(b) Safety standards
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Commission shall—
<br>
<br>(A) in consultation with representatives of consumer groups, juvenile product manufacturers, and independent child product engineers and experts, examine and assess the effectiveness of any voluntary consumer product safety standards for durable infant or toddler products; and
<br>
<br>(B) in accordance with section 553 of title 5, promulgate consumer product safety standards that—
<br>
<br>(i) are substantially the same as such voluntary standards; or
<br>
<br>(ii) are more stringent than such voluntary standards, if the Commission determines that more stringent standards would further reduce the risk of injury associated with such products.
<br>(2) Timetable for rulemaking
<br>
<br>Not later than 1 year after August 14, 2008, the Commission shall commence the rulemaking required under paragraph (1) and shall promulgate standards for no fewer than 2 categories of durable infant or toddler products every 6 months thereafter, beginning with the product categories that the Commission determines to be of highest priority, until the Commission has promulgated standards for all such product categories. Thereafter, the Commission shall periodically review and revise the standards set forth under this subsection to ensure that such standards provide the highest level of safety for such products that is feasible.
<br>(3) Judicial review
<br>
<br>Any person adversely affected by such standards may file a petition for review under the procedures set forth in section 2060(g) of this title, as added by section 236 of this Act.
<br>(4) Process for considering subsequent revisions to voluntary standard
<br>(A) Notice of adoption of voluntary standard
<br>
<br>When the Commission promulgates a consumer product safety standard under this subsection that is based, in whole or in part, on a voluntary standard, the Commission shall notify the organization that issued the voluntary standard of the Commission's action and shall provide a copy of the consumer product safety standard to the organization.
<br>(B) Commission action on revised voluntary standard
<br>
<br>If an organization revises a standard that has been adopted, in whole or in part, as a consumer product safety standard under this subsection, it shall notify the Commission. The revised voluntary standard shall be considered to be a consumer product safety standard issued by the Commission under section 2058 of this title, effective 180 days after the date on which the organization notifies the Commission (or such later date specified by the Commission in the Federal Register) unless, within 90 days after receiving that notice, the Commission notifies the organization that it has determined that the proposed revision does not improve the safety of the consumer product covered by the standard and that the Commission is retaining the existing consumer product safety standard.
<br>(c) Cribs
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>It shall be a violation of section 2068(a)(1) of this title for any person to which this subsection applies to manufacture, sell, contract to sell or resell, lease, sublet, offer, provide for use, or otherwise place in the stream of commerce a crib that is not in compliance with a standard promulgated under subsection (b).
<br>(2) Persons to which subsection applies
<br>
<br>This subsection applies to any person that—
<br>
<br>(A) manufactures, distributes in commerce, or contracts to sell cribs;

<br>
<br>(D) owns or operates a place of public accommodation affecting commerce (as defined in section 2203 of this title applied without regard to the phrase "not owned by the Federal Government").
<br>(3) Application of any revision
<br>
<br>With respect to any revision of the standard promulgated under subsection (b)(1)(B) subsequent to the initial promulgation of a standard under such subsection, paragraph (1) shall apply only to a person that manufactures or imports cribs, unless the Commission determines that application to any other person described in paragraph (2) is necessary to protect against an unreasonable risk to health or safety. If the Commission determines that application to a person described in paragraph (2) is necessary, it shall provide not less than 12 months for such person to come into compliance.
<br>(4) Crib defined
<br>
<br>In this subsection, the term "crib" includes—

<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any provision of chapter 6 of title 5 or the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), not later than 1 year after August 14, 2008, the Commission shall, pursuant to its authority under section 2065(b) of this title, promulgate a final consumer product safety rule to require each manufacturer of a durable infant or toddler product—
<br>
<br>(A) to provide consumers with a postage-paid consumer registration form with each such product;
<br>
<br>(B) to maintain a record of the names, addresses, e-mail addresses, and other contact information of consumers who register their ownership of such products with the manufacturer in order to improve the effectiveness of manufacturer campaigns to recall such products; and
<br>
<br>(C) to permanently place the manufacturer name and contact information, model name and number, and the date of manufacture on each durable infant or toddler product.
<br>(2) Requirements for registration form
<br>
<br>The registration form required to be provided to consumers under paragraph (1) shall—
<br>
<br>(A) include spaces for a consumer to provide the consumer's name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address;
<br>
<br>(B) include space sufficiently large to permit easy, legible recording of all desired information;
<br>
<br>(C) be attached to the surface of each durable infant or toddler product so that, as a practical matter, the consumer must notice and handle the form after purchasing the product;
<br>
<br>(D) include the manufacturer's name, model name and number for the product, and the date of manufacture;
<br>
<br>(E) include a message explaining the purpose of the registration and designed to encourage consumers to complete the registration;
<br>
<br>(F) include an option for consumers to register through the Internet; and
<br>

<br>
<br>In issuing regulations under this section, the Commission may prescribe the exact text and format of the required registration form.
<br>(3) Record keeping and notification requirements
<br>
<br>The rules required under this section shall require each manufacturer of a durable infant or toddler product to maintain a record of registrants for each product manufactured that includes all of the information provided by each consumer registered, and to use such information to notify such consumers in the event of a voluntary or involuntary recall of or safety alert regarding such product. Each manufacturer shall maintain such a record for a period of not less than 6 years after the date of manufacture of the product. Consumer information collected by a manufacturer under this Act may not be used by the manufacturer, nor disseminated by such manufacturer to any other party, for any purpose other than notification to such consumer in the event of a product recall or safety alert.

<br>§2056b. Mandatory toy safety standards
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>Beginning 180 days after August 14, 2008, the provisions of ASTM International Standard F963–07 Consumer Safety Specifications for Toy Safety (ASTM F963), as it exists on August 14, 2008 (except for section 4.2 and Annex 4 or any provision that restates or incorporates an existing mandatory standard or ban promulgated by the Commission or by statute or any provision that restates or incorporates a regulation promulgated by the Food and Drug Administration or any statute administered by the Food and Drug Administration) shall be considered to be consumer product safety standards issued by the Commission under section 2058 of this title.
<br>(b) Rulemaking for specific toys, components and risks
<br>(1) Evaluation
<br>
<br>Not later than 1 year after August 14, 2008, the Commission, in consultation with representatives of consumer groups, juvenile product manufacturers, and independent child product engineers and experts, shall examine and assess the effectiveness of ASTM F963 or its successor standard (except for section 4.2 and Annex 4), as it relates to safety requirements, safety labeling requirements, and test methods related to—
<br>
<br>(A) internal harm or injury hazards caused by the ingestion or inhalation of magnets in children's products;
<br>
<br>(B) toxic substances;
<br>
<br>(C) toys with spherical ends;
<br>
<br>(D) hemispheric-shaped objects;
<br>
<br>(E) cords, straps, and elastics; and
<br>
<br>(F) battery-operated toys.
<br>(2) Rulemaking
<br>
<br>Within 1 year after the completion of the assessment required by paragraph (1), the Commission shall promulgate rules in accordance with section 553 of title 5 that—
<br>
<br>(A) take into account other children's product safety rules; and
<br>
<br>(B) are more stringent than such standards, if the Commission determines that more stringent standards would further reduce the risk of injury of such toys.
<br>(c) Periodic review
<br>
<br>The Commission shall periodically review and revise the rules set forth under this section to ensure that such rules provide the highest level of safety for such products that is feasible.
<br>(d) Consideration of remaining ASTM standards
<br>
<br>After promulgating the rules required by subsection (b), the Commission shall—
<br>
<br>(1) in consultation with representatives of consumer groups, juvenile product manufacturers, and independent child product engineers and experts, examine and assess the effectiveness of ASTM F963 (and alternative health protective requirements to prevent or minimize flammability of children's products) or its successor standard, and shall assess the adequacy of such standards in protecting children from safety hazards; and
<br>
<br>(2) in accordance with section 553 of title 5, promulgate consumer product safety rules that—
<br>
<br>(A) take into account other children's product safety rules; and
<br>
<br>(B) are more stringent than such standards, if the Commission determines that more stringent standards would further reduce the risk of injury associated with such toys.
<br>(e) Prioritization
<br>
<br>The Commission shall promulgate rules beginning with the product categories that the Commission determines to be of highest priority, until the Commission has promulgated standards for all such product categories.
<br>(f) Treatment as consumer product safety standards
<br>
<br>Rules issued under this section shall be considered consumer product safety standards issued by the Commission under section 2058 of this title.
<br>(g) Revisions
<br>
<br>If ASTM International (or its successor entity) proposes to revise ASTM F963–07, or a successor standard, it shall notify the Commission of the proposed revision. The Commission shall incorporate the revision or a section of the revision into the consumer product safety rule. The revised standard shall be considered to be a consumer product safety standard issued by the Consumer Product Safety Commission under section 2058 of this title, effective 180 days after the date on which ASTM International notifies the Commission of the revision unless, within 90 days after receiving that notice, the Commission notifies ASTM International that it has determined that the proposed revision does not improve the safety of the consumer product covered by the standard. If the Commission so notifies ASTM International with respect to a proposed revision of the standard, the existing standard shall continue to be considered to be a consumer product safety rule without regard to the proposed revision.
<br>(h) Rulemaking to consider exemption from preemption
<br>(1) Exemption of State law from preemption
<br>
<br>Upon application of a State or political subdivision of a State, the Commission shall, after notice and opportunity for oral presentation of views, consider a rulemaking to exempt from the provisions of section 2075(a) of this title (under such conditions as it may impose in the rule) any proposed safety standard or regulation which is described in such application and which is designed to protect against a risk of injury associated with a children's product subject to the consumer product safety standards described in subsection (a) or any rule promulgated under this section. The Commission shall grant such an exemption if the State or political subdivision standard or regulation—
<br>
<br>(A) provides a significantly higher degree of protection from such risk of injury than the consumer product safety standard or rule under this section; and
<br>
<br>(B) does not unduly burden interstate commerce.
<br>
<br>In determining the burden, if any, of a State or political subdivision standard or regulation on interstate commerce, the Commission shall consider and make appropriate (as determined by the Commission in its discretion) findings on the technological and economic feasibility of complying with such standard or regulation, the cost of complying with such standard or regulation, the geographic distribution of the consumer product to which the standard or regulation would apply, the probability of other States or political subdivisions applying for an exemption under this subsection for a similar standard or regulation, and the need for a national, uniform standard under this Act for such consumer product.
<br>(2) Effect of standards on established State laws
<br>
<br>Nothing in this section or in section 2075 of this title shall prevent a State or political subdivision of a State from continuing in effect a safety requirement applicable to a toy or other children's product that is designed to deal with the same risk of injury as the consumer product safety standards established by this section and that is in effect on the day before August 14, 2008, if such State or political subdivision has filed such requirement with the Commission within 90 days after August 14, 2008, in such form and in such manner as the Commission may require.
<br>(i) Judicial review
<br>
<br>The issuance of any rule under this section is subject to judicial review as provided in section 2060(g) of this title, as added by section 236 of this Act.

<br>Codification
<br>
<br>Section was enacted as part of the Crime Control Act of 1990, and not as part of the Consumer Product Safety Act which comprises this chapter.
<br>§2057c. Prohibition on sale of certain products containing specified phthalates
<br>(a) Prohibition on the sale of certain products containing phthalates
<br>
<br>Beginning on the date that is 180 days after August 14, 2008, it shall be unlawful for any person to manufacture for sale, offer for sale, distribute in commerce, or import into the United States any children's toy or child care article that contains concentrations of more than 0.1 percent of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), or benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP).
<br>(b) Prohibition on the sale of additional products containing certain phthalates
<br>(1) Interim prohibition
<br>
<br>Beginning on the date that is 180 days after August 14, 2008, and until a final rule is promulgated under paragraph (3), it shall be unlawful for any person to manufacture for sale, offer for sale, distribute in commerce, or import into the United States any children's toy that can be placed in a child's mouth or child care article that contains concentrations of more than 0.1 percent of diisononyl phthalate (DINP), diisodecyl phthalate (DIDP), or di-n-octyl phthalate (DnOP).
<br>(2) Chronic Hazard Advisory Panel
<br>(A) Appointment
<br>
<br>Not earlier than 180 days after August 14, 2008, the Commission shall begin the process of appointing a Chronic Hazard Advisory Panel pursuant to the procedures of section 28 of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2077) to study the effects on children's health of all phthalates and phthalate alternatives as used in children's toys and child care articles.
<br>(B) Examination
<br>
<br>The panel shall, within 18 months after its appointment under subparagraph (A), complete an examination of the full range of phthalates that are used in products for children and shall—
<br>
<br>(i) examine all of the potential health effects (including endocrine disrupting effects) of the full range of phthalates;
<br>
<br>(ii) consider the potential health effects of each of these phthalates both in isolation and in combination with other phthalates;
<br>
<br>(iii) examine the likely levels of children's, pregnant women's, and others' exposure to phthalates, based on a reasonable estimation of normal and foreseeable use and abuse of such products;
<br>
<br>(iv) consider the cumulative effect of total exposure to phthalates, both from children's products and from other sources, such as personal care products;
<br>
<br>(v) review all relevant data, including the most recent, best-available, peer-reviewed, scientific studies of these phthalates and phthalate alternatives that employ objective data collection practices or employ other objective methods;
<br>
<br>(vi) consider the health effects of phthalates not only from ingestion but also as a result of dermal, hand-to-mouth, or other exposure;
<br>
<br>(vii) consider the level at which there is a reasonable certainty of no harm to children, pregnant women, or other susceptible individuals and their offspring, considering the best available science, and using sufficient safety factors to account for uncertainties regarding exposure and susceptibility of children, pregnant women, and other potentially susceptible individuals; and
<br>
<br>(viii) consider possible similar health effects of phthalate alternatives used in children's toys and child care articles.
<br>
<br>The panel's examinations pursuant to this paragraph shall be conducted de novo. The findings and conclusions of any previous Chronic Hazard Advisory Panel on this issue and other studies conducted by the Commission shall be reviewed by the panel but shall not be considered determinative.
<br>(C) Report
<br>
<br>Not later than 180 days after completing its examination, the panel appointed under subparagraph (A) shall report to the Commission the results of the examination conducted under this section and shall make recommendations to the Commission regarding any phthalates (or combinations of phthalates) in addition to those identified in subsection (a) or phthalate alternatives that the panel determines should be declared banned hazardous substances.
<br>(3) Permanent prohibition by rule
<br>
<br>Not later than 180 days after receiving the report of the panel under paragraph (2)(C), the Commission shall, pursuant to section 553 of title 5, promulgate a final rule to—
<br>
<br>(A) determine, based on such report, whether to continue in effect the prohibition under paragraph (1), in order to ensure a reasonable certainty of no harm to children, pregnant women, or other susceptible individuals with an adequate margin of safety; and
<br>
<br>(B) evaluate the findings and recommendations of the Chronic Hazard Advisory Panel and declare any children's product containing any phthalates to be a banned hazardous product under section 8 of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2057), as the Commission determines necessary to protect the health of children.
<br>(c) Application
<br>
<br>Effective on August 12, 2011,1 subsections (a) and (b)(1) and any rule promulgated under subsection (b)(3) shall apply to any plasticized component part of a children's toy or child care article or any other component part of a children's toy or child care article that is made of other materials that may contain phthalates.
<br>(d) Exclusion for inaccessible component parts
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The prohibitions established under subsections (a) and (b) shall not apply to any component part of a children's toy or child care article that is not accessible to a child through normal and reasonably foreseeable use and abuse of such product, as determined by the Commission. A component part is not accessible under this paragraph if such component part is not physically exposed by reason of a sealed covering or casing and does not become physically exposed through reasonably foreseeable use and abuse of the product. Reasonably foreseeable use and abuse shall include swallowing, mouthing, breaking, or other children's activities, and the aging of the product.
<br>(2) Limitation
<br>
<br>The Commission may revoke an exclusion or all exclusions granted under paragraph (1) at any time and require that any or all component parts manufactured after such exclusion is revoked comply with the prohibitions established under subsections (a) and (b) if the Commission finds, based on scientific evidence, that such compliance is necessary to protect the public health or safety.
<br>(3) Inaccessibility proceeding
<br>
<br>Within 1 year after August 12, 2011, the Commission shall—
<br>
<br>(A) promulgate a rule providing guidance with respect to what product components, or classes of components, will be considered to be inaccessible for purposes of paragraph (1); or
<br>
<br>(B) adopt the same guidance with respect to inaccessibility that was adopted by the Commission with regards to accessibility of lead under section 1278a(b)(2)(B) of this title, with additional consideration, as appropriate, of whether such component can be placed in a child's mouth.
<br>(4) Application pending commission guidance
<br>
<br>Until the Commission promulgates a rule pursuant to paragraph (3), the determination of whether a product component is inaccessible to a child shall be made in accordance with the requirements laid out in paragraph (1) for considering a component to be inaccessible to a child.
<br>(e) Treatment of violation
<br>
<br>A violation of subsection (a) or (b)(1) or any rule promulgated by the Commission under subsection (b)(3) shall be treated as a violation of section 19(a)(1) of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2068(a)(1)).
<br>(f) Treatment as consumer product safety standards; effect on State laws
<br>
<br>Subsections (a) and (b)(1) and any rule promulgated under subsection (b)(3) shall be considered consumer product safety standards under the Consumer Product Safety Act [15 U.S.C. 2051 et seq.]. Nothing in this section or the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2051 et seq.) shall be construed to preempt or otherwise affect any State requirement with respect to any phthalate alternative not specifically regulated in a consumer product safety standard under the Consumer Product Safety Act.

<br>§2058. Procedure for consumer product safety rules
<br>(a) Commencement of proceeding; publication of prescribed notice of proposed rulemaking; transmittal of notice
<br>
<br>A proceeding for the development of a consumer product safety rule may be commenced by the publication in the Federal Register of an advance notice of proposed rulemaking which shall—
<br>
<br>(1) identify the product and the nature of the risk of injury associated with the product;
<br>
<br>(2) include a summary of each of the regulatory alternatives under consideration by the Commission (including voluntary consumer product safety standards);
<br>
<br>(3) include information with respect to any existing standard known to the Commission which may be relevant to the proceedings, together with a summary of the reasons why the Commission believes preliminarily that such standard does not eliminate or adequately reduce the risk of injury identified in paragraph (1);
<br>
<br>(4) invite interested persons to submit to the Commission, within such period as the Commission shall specify in the notice (which period shall not be less than 30 days or more than 60 days after the date of publication of the notice), comments with respect to the risk of injury identified by the Commission, the regulatory alternatives being considered, and other possible alternatives for addressing the risk;
<br>
<br>(5) invite any person (other than the Commission) to submit to the Commission, within such period as the Commission shall specify in the notice (which period shall not be less than 30 days after the date of publication of the notice), an existing standard or a portion of a standard as a proposed consumer product safety standard; and
<br>
<br>(6) invite any person (other than the Commission) to submit to the Commission, within such period as the Commission shall specify in the notice (which period shall not be less than 30 days after the date of publication of the notice), a statement of intention to modify or develop a voluntary consumer product safety standard to address the risk of injury identified in paragraph (1) together with a description of a plan to modify or develop the standard.
<br>
<br>The Commission shall transmit such notice within 10 calendar days to the appropriate Congressional committees.
<br>(b) Voluntary standard; publication as proposed rule; notice of reliance of Commission on standard
<br>
<br>(1) If the Commission determines that any standard submitted to it in response to an invitation in a notice published under subsection (a)(5) if promulgated (in whole, in part, or in combination with any other standard submitted to the Commission or any part of such a standard) as a consumer product safety standard, would eliminate or adequately reduce the risk of injury identified in a notice under subsection (a)(1), the Commission may publish such standard, in whole, in part, or in such combination and with nonmaterial modifications, as a proposed consumer product safety rule.
<br>
<br>(2) If the Commission determines that—
<br>
<br>(A) compliance with any standard submitted to it in response to an invitation in a notice published under subsection (a)(6) is likely to result in the elimination or adequate reduction of the risk of injury identified in the notice, and
<br>
<br>(B) it is likely that there will be substantial compliance with such standard,
<br>
<br>the Commission shall terminate any proceeding to promulgate a consumer product safety rule respecting such risk of injury and shall publish in the Federal Register a notice which includes the determination of the Commission and which notifies the public that the Commission will rely on the voluntary standard to eliminate or reduce the risk of injury, except that the Commission shall terminate any such proceeding and rely on a voluntary standard only if such voluntary standard is in existence. For purposes of this section, a voluntary standard shall be considered to be in existence when it is finally approved by the organization or other person which developed such standard, irrespective of the effective date of the standard. Before relying upon any voluntary consumer product safety standard, the Commission shall afford interested persons (including manufacturers, consumers, and consumer organizations) a reasonable opportunity to submit written comments regarding such standard. The Commission shall consider such comments in making any determination regarding reliance on the involved voluntary standard under this subsection.
<br>(c) Publication of proposed rule; preliminary regulatory analysis; contents; transmittal of notice
<br>
<br>No consumer product safety rule may be proposed by the Commission unless the Commission publishes in the Federal Register the text of the proposed rule, including any alternatives, which the Commission proposes to promulgate, together with a preliminary regulatory analysis containing—
<br>
<br>(1) a preliminary description of the potential benefits and potential costs of the proposed rule, including any benefits or costs that cannot be quantified in monetary terms, and an identification of those likely to receive the benefits and bear the costs;
<br>
<br>(2) a discussion of the reasons any standard or portion of a standard submitted to the Commission under subsection (a)(5) was not published by the Commission as the proposed rule or part of the proposed rule;
<br>
<br>(3) a discussion of the reasons for the Commission's preliminary determination that efforts proposed under subsection (a)(6) and assisted by the Commission as required by section 2054(a)(3) of this title would not, within a reasonable period of time, be likely to result in the development of a voluntary consumer product safety standard that would eliminate or adequately reduce the risk of injury addressed by the proposed rule; and
<br>
<br>(4) a description of any reasonable alternatives to the proposed rule, together with a summary description of their potential costs and benefits, and a brief explanation of why such alternatives should not be published as a proposed rule.
<br>
<br>The Commission shall transmit such notice within 10 calendar days to the appropriate Congressional committees. Any proposed consumer product safety rule shall be issued within twelve months after the date of publication of the notice, unless the Commission determines that such proposed rule is not reasonably necessary to eliminate or reduce the risk of injury associated with the product or is not in the public interest. The Commission may extend the twelve-month period for good cause. If the Commission extends such period, it shall immediately transmit notice of such extension to the appropriate Congressional committees. Such notice shall include an explanation of the reasons for such extension, together with an estimate of the date by which the Commission anticipates such rulemaking will be completed. The Commission shall publish notice of such extension and the information submitted to the Congress in the Federal Register. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude any person from submitting an existing standard or portion of a standard as a proposed consumer product safety standard.
<br>(d) Promulgation of rule; time
<br>
<br>(1) Within 60 days after the publication under subsection (c) of a proposed consumer product safety rule respecting a risk of injury associated with a consumer product, the Commission shall—
<br>
<br>(A) promulgate a consumer product safety rule respecting the risk of injury associated with such product, if it makes the findings required under subsection (f), or
<br>
<br>(B) withdraw the applicable notice of proposed rulemaking if it determines that such rule is not (i) reasonably necessary to eliminate or reduce an unreasonable risk of injury associated with the product, or (ii) in the public interest;
<br>
<br>except that the Commission may extend such 60-day period for good cause shown (if it publishes its reasons therefor in the Federal Register).
<br>
<br>(2) Consumer product safety rules shall be promulgated in accordance with section 553 of title 5, except that the Commission shall give interested persons an opportunity for the oral presentation of data, views, or arguments, in addition to an opportunity to make written submissions. A transcript shall be kept of any oral presentation.
<br>(e) Expression of risk of injury; consideration of available product data; needs of elderly and handicapped
<br>
<br>A consumer product safety rule shall express in the rule itself the risk of injury which the standard is designed to eliminate or reduce. In promulgating such a rule the Commission shall consider relevant available product data including the results of research, development, testing, and investigation activities conducted generally and pursuant to this chapter. In the promulgation of such a rule the Commission shall also consider and take into account the special needs of elderly and handicapped persons to determine the extent to which such persons may be adversely affected by such rule.
<br>(f) Findings; final regulatory analysis; judicial review of rule
<br>
<br>(1) Prior to promulgating a consumer product safety rule, the Commission shall consider, and shall make appropriate findings for inclusion in such rule with respect to—
<br>
<br>(A) the degree and nature of the risk of injury the rule is designed to eliminate or reduce;
<br>
<br>(B) the approximate number of consumer products, or types or classes thereof, subject to such rule;
<br>
<br>(C) the need of the public for the consumer products subject to such rule, and the probable effect of such rule upon the utility, cost, or availability of such products to meet such need; and
<br>
<br>(D) any means of achieving the objective of the order while minimizing adverse effects on competition or disruption or dislocation of manufacturing and other commercial practices consistent with the public health and safety.
<br>
<br>(2) The Commission shall not promulgate a consumer product safety rule unless it has prepared, on the basis of the findings of the Commission under paragraph (1) and on other information before the Commission, a final regulatory analysis of the rule containing the following information:
<br>
<br>(A) A description of the potential benefits and potential costs of the rule, including costs and benefits that cannot be quantified in monetary terms, and the identification of those likely to receive the benefits and bear the costs.
<br>
<br>(B) A description of any alternatives to the final rule which were considered by the Commission, together with a summary description of their potential benefits and costs and a brief explanation of the reasons why these alternatives were not chosen.
<br>
<br>(C) A summary of any significant issues raised by the comments submitted during the public comment period in response to the preliminary regulatory analysis, and a summary of the assessment by the Commission of such issues.
<br>
<br>The Commission shall publish its final regulatory analysis with the rule.
<br>
<br>(3) The Commission shall not promulgate a consumer product safety rule unless it finds (and includes such finding in the rule)—
<br>
<br>(A) that the rule (including its effective date) is reasonably necessary to eliminate or reduce an unreasonable risk of injury associated with such product;
<br>
<br>(B) that the promulgation of the rule is in the public interest;
<br>
<br>(C) in the case of a rule declaring the product a banned hazardous product, that no feasible consumer product safety standard under this chapter would adequately protect the public from the unreasonable risk of injury associated with such product;
<br>
<br>(D) in the case of a rule which relates to a risk of injury with respect to which persons who would be subject to such rule have adopted and implemented a voluntary consumer product safety standard, that—
<br>
<br>(i) compliance with such voluntary consumer product safety standard is not likely to result in the elimination or adequate reduction of such risk of injury; or
<br>
<br>(ii) it is unlikely that there will be substantial compliance with such voluntary consumer product safety standard;
<br>
<br>(E) that the benefits expected from the rule bear a reasonable relationship to its costs; and
<br>
<br>(F) that the rule imposes the least burdensome requirement which prevents or adequately reduces the risk of injury for which the rule is being promulgated.
<br>
<br>(4)(A) Any preliminary or final regulatory analysis prepared under subsection (c) or (f)(2) shall not be subject to independent judicial review, except that when an action for judicial review of a rule is instituted, the contents of any such regulatory analysis shall constitute part of the whole rulemaking record of agency action in connection with such review.
<br>
<br>(B) The provisions of subparagraph (A) shall not be construed to alter the substantive or procedural standards otherwise applicable to judicial review of any action by the Commission.
<br>(g) Effective date of rule or standard; stockpiling of product
<br>
<br>(1) Each consumer product safety rule shall specify the date such rule is to take effect not exceeding 180 days from the date promulgated, unless the Commission finds, for good cause shown, that a later effective date is in the public interest and publishes its reasons for such finding. The effective date of a consumer product safety standard under this chapter shall be set at a date at least 30 days after the date of promulgation unless the Commission for good cause shown determines that an earlier effective date is in the public interest. In no case may the effective date be set at a date which is earlier than the date of promulgation. A consumer product safety standard shall be applicable only to consumer products manufactured after the effective date.
<br>
<br>(2) The Commission may by rule prohibit a manufacturer of a consumer product from stockpiling any product to which a consumer product safety rule applies, or to which a rule under this chapter or similar rule, regulation, standard, or ban under any other Act enforced by the Commission applies, so as to prevent such manufacturer from circumventing the purpose of such rule, regulation, standard, or ban. For purposes of this paragraph, the term "stockpiling" means manufacturing or importing a product between the date of promulgation of such rule, regulation, standard, or ban and its effective date at a rate which is significantly greater (as determined under the rule under this paragraph) than the rate at which such product was produced or imported during a base period (prescribed in the rule under this paragraph) ending before the date of promulgation of the rule, regulation, standard, or ban.
<br>(h) Amendment or revocation of rule
<br>
<br>The Commission may by rule amend or revoke any consumer product safety rule. Such amendment or revocation shall specify the date on which it is to take effect which shall not exceed 180 days from the date the amendment or revocation is published unless the Commission finds for good cause shown that a later effective date is in the public interest and publishes its reasons for such finding. Where an amendment involves a material change in a consumer product safety rule, sections 2056 and 2057 of this title, and subsections (a) through (g) of this section shall apply. In order to revoke a consumer product safety rule, the Commission shall publish a proposal to revoke such rule in the Federal Register, and allow oral and written presentations in accordance with subsection (d)(2) of this section. It may revoke such rule only if it determines that the rule is not reasonably necessary to eliminate or reduce an unreasonable risk of injury associated with the product. Section 2060 of this title shall apply to any amendment of a consumer product safety rule which involves a material change and to any revocation of a consumer product safety rule, in the same manner and to the same extent as such section applies to the Commission's action in promulgating such a rule.
<br>(i) Petition to initiate rulemaking
<br>
<br>The Commission shall grant, in whole or in part, or deny any petition under section 553(e) of title 5 requesting the Commission to initiate a rulemaking, within a reasonable time after the date on which such petition is filed. The Commission shall state the reasons for granting or denying such petition. The Commission may not deny any such petition on the basis of a voluntary standard unless the voluntary standard is in existence at the time of the denial of the petition, the Commission has determined that the voluntary standard is likely to result in the elimination or adequate reduction of the risk of injury identified in the petition, and it is likely that there will be substantial compliance with the standard.

<br>
<br>Pub. L. 110–314, title II, §236(b), Aug. 14, 2008, 122 Stat. 3076, provided that: "The amendment made by subsection (a) [amending this section] shall not apply to any petition filed before the date of enactment of this Act [Aug. 14, 2008] for judicial review of any action by the Consumer Product Safety Commission."
<br>
<br>1 So in original. Probably should be followed by a closing parenthesis.
<br>§2061. Imminent hazards
<br>(a) Filing of action
<br>
<br>The Commission may file in a United States district court an action (1) against an imminently hazardous consumer product for seizure of such product under subsection (b)(2), or (2) against any person who is a manufacturer, distributor, or retailer of such product, or (3) against both. Such an action may be filed notwithstanding the existence of a consumer product safety rule applicable to such product, or the pendency of any administrative or judicial proceedings under any other provision of this chapter. As used in this section, and hereinafter in this chapter, the term "imminently hazardous consumer product" means a consumer product which presents imminent and unreasonable risk of death, serious illness, or severe personal injury.
<br>(b) Relief; product condemnation and seizure
<br>
<br>(1) The district court in which such action is filed shall have jurisdiction to declare such product an imminently hazardous consumer product, and (in the case of an action under subsection (a)(2) of this section) to grant (as ancillary to such declaration or in lieu thereof) such temporary or permanent relief as may be necessary to protect the public from such risk. Such relief may include a mandatory order requiring the notification of such risk to purchasers of such product known to the defendant, public notice, the recall, the repair or the replacement of, or refund for, such product.
<br>
<br>(2) In the case of an action under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the consumer product may be proceeded against by process of libel for the seizure and condemnation of such product in any United States district court within the jurisdiction of which such consumer product is found. Proceedings and cases instituted under the authority of the preceding sentence shall conform as nearly as possible to proceedings in rem in admiralty.
<br>(c) Consumer product safety rule
<br>
<br>Where appropriate, concurrently with the filing of such action or as soon thereafter as may be practicable, the Commission shall initiate a proceeding to promulgate a consumer product safety rule applicable to the consumer product with respect to which such action is filed.
<br>(d) Jurisdiction and venue; process; subpena
<br>
<br>(1) An action under subsection (a)(2) of this section may be brought in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or in any judicial district in which any of the defendants is found, is an inhabitant or transacts business; and process in such an action may be served on a defendant in any other district in which such defendant resides or may be found. Subpenas requiring attendance of witnesses in such an action may run into any other district. In determining the judicial district in which an action may be brought under this section in instances in which such action may be brought in more than one judicial district, the Commission shall take into account the convenience of the parties.
<br>
<br>(2) Whenever proceedings under this section involving substantially similar consumer products are pending in courts in two or more judicial districts, they shall be consolidated for trial by order of any such court upon application reasonably made by any party in interest, upon notice to all other parties in interest.
<br>(e) Employment of attorneys by Commission
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in any action under this section, the Commission may direct attorneys employed by it to appear and represent it.
<br>(g) 1 Cost-benefit analysis of compliance with relief ordered in action for judicial review of consumer product safety rule not required
<br>
<br>Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the Commission, in determining whether to bring an action against a consumer product or a person under this section, to prepare a comparison of the costs that would be incurred in complying with the relief that may be ordered in such action with the benefits to the public from such relief.
