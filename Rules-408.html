<br>(ii) No foreclosure
<br>
<br>Without seeking foreclosure (or in any case in which a foreclosure proceeding initiated under clause (i) continues for a period in excess of 1 year), the holder of the guarantee may submit to the Secretary a request to assign the obligation and security interest to the Secretary in return for payment of the claim under the guarantee. The Secretary may accept assignment of the loan if the Secretary determines that the assignment is in the best interests of the United States.

The Secretary shall then take such action to collect as the Secretary determines appropriate.
<br>(2) Limitations on liquidation

<br>In the event of a default by the borrower on a loan guaranteed under this section involving a security interest in restricted Indian land, the mortgagee or the Secretary shall only pursue liquidation after offering to transfer the account to an eligible tribal member, the tribe, or the Indian housing authority serving the tribe or tribes.

<br>§1715z–14. Risk-sharing demonstration

<br>
<br>The purpose of this section is to authorize a demonstration mortgage risk-sharing program designed to test the feasibility of entering into risk-sharing contracts with private mortgage insurers and with insured community development financial institutions in order to reduce Government risk and administrative costs, and to speed mortgage processing. The Secretary shall limit the demonstration under this section to not more than four administrative regions of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and shall assure that the program is in the financial interest of the Government and will not result in loss of employment by any employees of the Department of Housing and Urban Development before the expiration of the 5-year period beginning on December 21, 2000. The aggregate number of mortgages for which risk of nonpayment is shared under this section in any administrative region of the Department of Housing and Urban Development in any fiscal year may not exceed 20 percent of the aggregate number of mortgages and loans insured by the Secretary under this subchapter in such region during the preceding fiscal year.
<br>(b) One- to four-family dwellings; requirements for private mortgage insurance companies

Such contracts shall require private mortgage insurance companies and insured community development financial institutions to—
<br>
<br>(1) assume a secondary percentage of loss on any mortgage insured pursuant to section 1709(b), 1715y, or 1715z–10 of this title covering a one- to four-family dwelling, which percentage of loss shall be set forth in the risk-sharing contract, with the first percentage of loss to be borne by the Secretary; 2
<br>
<br>(2) perform or delegate underwriting, credit approval, appraisal, inspection, commitment, claims processing, property disposition, or other functions as the Secretary shall approve as consistent with the purposes of this section and shall set forth in the risk-sharing contract.
<br>(c) Required contract provisions
<br>
<br>Any contract for risk-sharing under this section shall contain such provisions relating to the sharing of premiums received by the Secretary with a private mortgage insurer or insured community development financial institution on a sound actuarial basis, establishment of loss reserves, manner of calculating claims on such risk-sharing contract, conditions with respect to foreclosure, handling and disposition of property prior to claim or settlement, rights of assignees, and other similar matters as the Secretary may prescribe pursuant to regulations. Pursuant to a contract under this section, a private mortgage insurance company or insured community development financial institution shall endorse loans for risk-sharing and take such other actions on behalf of the Secretary and in the Secretary's name as the Secretary may authorize.
<br>(d) Mortgages offered for inclusion by Secretary
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall require any private mortgage insurance company or insured community development financial institution participating in the program under this section to provide risk-sharing for those mortgages offered by the Secretary for inclusion in the program.

<br>The Secretary may insure under any provision of this subchapter a mortgage involving property upon which there is located a dwelling designed principally for occupancy by one to four families, where the mortgage provides for periodic adjustments by the mortgagee in the effective rate of interest charged. Such interest rate adjustments may be accomplished through adjustments in the monthly payment amount, the outstanding principal balance, or the mortgage term, or a combination of these factors, except that in no case may any extension of a mortgage term result in a total term in excess of 40 years. Adjustments in the effective rate of interest shall correspond to a specified national interest rate index approved in regulations by the Secretary, information on which is readily accessible to mortgagors from generally available published sources. Adjustments in the effective rate of interest shall (1) be made on an annual basis; (2) be limited, with respect to any single interest rate increase, to no more than 1 percent on the outstanding loan balance; and (3) be limited to a maximum increase of 5 percentage points above the initial contract interest rate over the term of the mortgage.

<br>
<br>(A) shall be fixed for a period of not less than the first 3 years of the mortgage term;
<br>
<br>(B) shall be adjusted by the mortgagee initially upon the expiration of such period and annually thereafter; and
<br>
<br>(C) in the case of the initial interest rate adjustment, is subject to the 1 percent limitation only if the interest rate remained fixed for 3 or fewer years.
<br>
<br>(2) The disclosure required under subsection (b) shall be required for a mortgage insured under this subsection.

<br>§1715z–17. Shared appreciation mortgages for single family housing
<br>(a) One- to four-family dwellings; requirements
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any provision of this subchapter that is inconsistent with this section, the Secretary may insure, under any provision of this subchapter providing for insurance of mortgages on properties upon which there is located a dwelling designed principally for occupancy by one to four families, a mortgage secured by a first lien on such a property or on the stock allocated to a dwelling unit in a residential cooperative housing corporation, which—

<br>
<br>(2) bears interest at a rate which meets criteria prescribed by the Secretary;
<br>
<br>(3) provides for amortization over a period of not to exceed 30 years, but the actual term of the mortgage (excluding any refinancing) may be not less than 10 nor more than 30 years, and contains such provisions relating to refinancing of the principal balance of the mortgage and any contingent deferred interest as the Secretary may provide; and

<br>In the event of a default, the mortgagee shall be entitled to receive the benefits of insurance in accordance with section 1710(a) of this title, but such insurance benefits shall not include the mortgagee's share of net appreciated value. The term "original principal obligation of the mortgage" as used in section 1710 of this title shall not include the mortgagee's share of net appreciated value.
<br>(d) Inapplicability of State constitution, statute, etc., limiting or prohibiting increases in outstanding loan balance
<br>
<br>Mortgages insured pursuant to this section which contain provisions for sharing appreciation or which otherwise require or permit increases in the outstanding loan balance which are authorized under this section or under applicable regulations shall not be subject to any State constitution, statute, court decree, common law, rule, or public policy limiting or prohibiting increases in the outstanding loan balance after execution of the mortgage.
<br>(e) Encouraged use of insurance by low and moderate income families
<br>
<br>In carrying out the provisions of this section, the Secretary shall encourage the use of insurance under this section by low and moderate income tenants who would otherwise be displaced by the conversion of their rental housing to condominium or cooperative ownership.
<br>(f) Consumer protections and disclosure requirements
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall prescribe adequate consumer protections and disclosure requirements with respect to mortgages insured under this section, and may prescribe such other terms and conditions as may be appropriate to carry out the provisions of this section.

The term of the mortgage shall not be less than 15 years, and shall be repayable in equal monthly installments of principal and fixed interest during the mortgage term in an amount which would be sufficient to retire a debt with the same principal and fixed interest rate over a period not exceeding 30 years. In the case of a mortgage which will not be completely amortized during the mortgage term, the principal obligation of the mortgage may not exceed 85 percent of the estimated value of the property or project. For purposes of this section, the term "net appreciated value" means the amount by which the sales price of the property (less the mortgagor's selling costs) exceeds the actual project cost after completion, as approved by the Secretary. If there has been no sale or transfer at the time the mortgagee's share of net appreciated value becomes payable, the sales price for purposes of this section shall be determined by means of an appraisal conducted in accordance with procedures approved by the Secretary and provided for in the mortgage.

The Secretary shall also establish disclosure requirements applicable to mortgagees making mortgage loans pursuant to this section, to assure that mortgagors are informed of the characteristics of such mortgages.
<br>(e) Inapplicability of State constitution, statute, etc., limiting or prohibiting increases in outstanding loan balance
<br>
<br>Mortgages insured pursuant to this section which contain provisions for sharing appreciation or which otherwise require or permit increases in the outstanding loan balance which are authorized under this section or under applicable regulations shall not be subject to any State constitution, statute, court decree, common law, rule, or public policy limiting or prohibiting increases in the outstanding loan balance after execution of the mortgage.

<br>§1715z–20. Insurance of home equity conversion mortgages for elderly homeowners
<br>(a) Purpose
<br>
<br>The purpose of this section is to authorize the Secretary to carry out a program of mortgage insurance designed—
<br>
<br>(1) to meet the special needs of elderly homeowners by reducing the effect of the economic hardship caused by the increasing costs of meeting health, housing, and subsistence needs at a time of reduced income, through the insurance of home equity conversion mortgages to permit the conversion of a portion of accumulated home equity into liquid assets; and
<br>
<br>(2) to encourage and increase the involvement of mortgagees and participants in the mortgage markets in the making and servicing of home equity conversion mortgages for elderly homeowners.
<br>(b) Definitions
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section:
<br>
<br>(1) The terms "elderly homeowner" and "homeowner" mean any homeowner who is, or whose spouse is, at least 62 years of age or such higher age as the Secretary may prescribe.
<br>
<br>(2) The terms "mortgagee", "mortgagor", "real estate," 1 and "State" have the meanings given such terms in section 1707 of this title.
<br>
<br>(3) The term "home equity conversion mortgage" means a first mortgage which provides for future payments to the homeowner based on accumulated equity and which a housing creditor (as defined in section 3802(2) of this title) is authorized to make (A) under any law of the United States (other than section 3803 of this title) or applicable agency regulations thereunder; (B) in accordance with section 3803 of this title, notwithstanding any State constitution, law, or regulation; or (C) under any State constitution, law, or regulation.
<br>
<br>(4) Mortgage.—The term "mortgage" means a first mortgage or first lien on real estate, in fee simple, a first or subordinate mortgage or lien on all stock allocated to a dwelling unit in a residential cooperative housing corporation, or a first mortgage or first lien on a leasehold—
<br>
<br>(A) under a lease for not less than 99 years that is renewable; or
<br>
<br>(B) under a lease that has a term that ends no earlier than the minimum number of years, as specified by the Secretary, beyond the actuarial life expectancy of the mortgagor or comortgagor, whichever is the later date.
<br>
<br>(5) First mortgage.—The term "first mortgage" means such classes of first liens as are commonly given to secure advances on, or the unpaid purchase price of, real estate or a first or subordinate lien on all stock allocated to a dwelling unit in a residential cooperative housing corporation, under the laws of the State in which the real estate or dwelling unit is located, together with the credit instruments, if any, secured thereby.
<br>(c) Insurance authority
<br>
<br>The Secretary may, upon application by a mortgagee, insure any home equity conversion mortgage eligible for insurance under this section and, upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, make commitments for the insurance of such mortgages prior to the date of their execution or disbursement to the extent that the Secretary determines such mortgages—
<br>
<br>(1) have promise for improving the financial situation or otherwise meeting the special needs of elderly homeowners;
<br>
<br>(2) will include appropriate safeguards for mortgagors to offset the special risks of such mortgages; and
<br>
<br>(3) have a potential for acceptance in the mortgage market.
<br>(d) Eligibility requirements
<br>
<br>To be eligible for insurance under this section, a mortgage shall—
<br>
<br>(1) have been originated by a mortgagee approved by the Secretary;
<br>
<br>(2) have been executed by a mortgagor who—
<br>
<br>(A) qualifies as an elderly homeowner;
<br>
<br>(B) has received adequate counseling, as provided in subsection (f), by an independent third party that is not, either directly or indirectly, associated with or compensated by a party involved in—
<br>
<br>(i) originating or servicing the mortgage;

<br>(ii) funding the loan underlying the mortgage; or
<br>
<br>(iii) the sale of annuities, investments, long-term care insurance, or any other type of financial or insurance product;
<br>

<br>
<br>(D) meets any additional requirements prescribed by the Secretary;
<br>
<br>(3) be secured by a dwelling that is designed principally for a 1- to 4-family residence in which the mortgagor occupies 1 of the units;
<br>
<br>(4) provide that prepayment, in whole or in part, may be made without penalty at any time during the period of the mortgage;
<br>
<br>(5) provide for a fixed or variable interest rate or future sharing between the mortgagor and the mortgagee of the appreciation in the value of the property, as agreed upon by the mortgagor and the mortgagee;
<br>
<br>(6) contain provisions for satisfaction of the obligation satisfactory to the Secretary;
<br>
<br>(7) provide that the homeowner shall not be liable for any difference between the net amount of the remaining indebtedness of the homeowner under the mortgage and the amount recovered by the mortgagee from—

<br>(A) the net sales proceeds from the dwelling that are subject to the mortgage (based upon the amount of the accumulated equity selected by the mortgagor to be subject to the mortgage, as agreed upon by the mortgagor and mortgagee); or
<br>
<br>(B) the insurance benefits paid pursuant to subsection (i)(1)(C);
<br>
<br>(8) contain such terms and provisions with respect to insurance, repairs, alterations, payment of taxes, default reserve, delinquency charges, foreclosure proceedings, anticipation of maturity, additional and secondary liens, and other matters as the Secretary may prescribe;

<br>
<br>(10) provide that the mortgagor may convert the method of payment under paragraph (9) to any other method during the term of the mortgage, except that in the case of a fixed rate mortgage, the Secretary may, by regulation, limit such convertibility; and

<br>The Secretary shall require each mortgagee of a mortgage insured under this section to make available to the homeowner—

<br>
<br>(2) at least 10 days prior to loan closing, a statement informing the homeowner that the liability of the homeowner under the mortgage is limited and explaining the homeowner's rights, obligations, and remedies with respect to temporary absences from the home, late payments, and payment default by the lender, all conditions requiring satisfaction of the loan obligation, and any other information that the Secretary may require;
<br>
<br>(3) on an annual basis (but not later than January 31 of each year), a statement summarizing the total principal amount paid to the homeowner under the loan secured by the mortgage, the total amount of deferred interest added to the principal, and the outstanding loan balance at the end of the preceding year; and
<br>
<br>(4) prior to loan closing, a statement of the projected total cost of the mortgage to the homeowner based on the projected total future loan balance (such cost expressed as a single average annual interest rate for at least 2 different appreciation rates for the term of the mortgage) for not less than 2 projected loan terms, as the Secretary shall determine, which shall include—
<br>
<br>(A) the cost for a short-term mortgage; and
<br>
<br>(B) the cost for a loan term equaling the actuarial life expectancy of the mortgagor.
<br>(f) Counseling services and information for mortgagors
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall provide or cause to be provided adequate counseling for the mortgagor, as described in subsection (d)(2)(B). Such counseling shall be provided by counselors that meet qualification standards and follow uniform counseling protocols. The qualification standards and counseling protocols shall be established by the Secretary within 12 months of July 30, 2008. The protocols shall require a qualified counselor to discuss with each mortgagor information which shall include—
<br>
<br>(1) options other than a home equity conversion mortgage that are available to the homeowner, including other housing, social service, health, and financial options;
<br>
<br>(2) other home equity conversion options that are or may become available to the homeowner, such as sale-leaseback financing, deferred payment loans, and property tax deferral;
<br>
<br>(3) the financial implications of entering into a home equity conversion mortgage;
<br>
<br>(4) a disclosure that a home equity conversion mortgage may have tax consequences, affect eligibility for assistance under Federal and State programs, and have an impact on the estate and heirs of the homeowner; and
<br>
<br>(5) any other information that the Secretary may require.
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall consult with consumer groups, industry representatives, representatives of counseling organizations, and other interested parties to identify alternative approaches to providing consumer information required by this subsection that may be feasible and desirable for home equity conversion mortgages insured under this section and other types of reverse mortgages. The Secretary may, in lieu of providing the consumer education required by this subsection, adopt alternative approaches to consumer education that may be developed as a result of such consultations, but only if the alternative approaches provide all of the information specified in this subsection.
<br>(g) Limitation on insurance authority
<br>
<br>The aggregate number of mortgages insured under this section may not exceed 275,000. In no case may the benefits of insurance under this section exceed the maximum dollar amount limitation established under section 1454(a)(2) of this title for a 1-family residence.
<br>(h) Administrative authority
<br>
<br>The Secretary may—
<br>

<br>
<br>(2) make such investigations and studies of data, and publish and distribute such reports, as the Secretary determines to be appropriate; and
<br>
<br>(3) establish, by notice or mortgagee letter, any additional or alternative requirements that the Secretary, in the Secretary's discretion, determines are necessary to improve the fiscal safety and soundness of the program authorized by this section, which requirements shall take effect upon issuance.
<br>(i) Protection of homeowner and lender

<br>(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, and in order to further the purposes of the program authorized in this section, the Secretary shall take any action necessary—
<br>
<br>(A) to provide any mortgagor under this section with funds to which the mortgagor is entitled under the insured mortgage or ancillary contracts but that the mortgagor has not received because of the default of the party responsible for payment;
<br>
<br>(B) to obtain repayment of disbursements provided under subparagraph (A) from any source; and
