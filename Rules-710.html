<br>(c) Diversification of ownership
<br>

<br>
<br>Each small business investment company shall have authority to borrow money and to issue its securities, promissory notes, or other obligations under such general conditions and subject to such limitations and regulations as the Administration may prescribe.
<br>(b) Debentures and participating securities
<br>
<br>To encourage the formation and growth of small business investment companies the Administration is authorized when authorized in appropriation Acts, to purchase, or to guarantee the timely payment of all principal and interest as scheduled on, debentures or participating securities issued by such companies. Such purchases or guarantees may be made by the Administration on such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate, pursuant to regulations issued by the Administration. The full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the payment of all amounts which may be required to be paid under any guarantee under this subsection. Debentures purchased or guaranteed by the Administration under this subsection shall be subordinate to any other debenture bonds, promissory notes, or other debts and obligations of such companies, unless the Administration in its exercise of reasonable investment prudence and in considering the financial soundness of such company determines otherwise. Such debentures may be issued for a term of not to exceed fifteen years and shall bear interest at a rate not less than a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average maturities on such debentures, adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1 percent, plus, for debentures obligated after September 30, 2001, an additional charge, in an amount established annually by the Administration, as necessary to reduce to zero the cost (as defined in section 661a of title 2) to the Administration of purchasing and guaranteeing debentures under this chapter, which amount may not exceed 1.38 percent per year, and which shall be paid to and retained by the Administration. The debentures or participating securities shall also contain such other terms as the Administration may fix, and shall be subject to the following restrictions and limitations:
<br>
<br>(1) The total amount of debentures and participating securities that may be guaranteed by the Administration and outstanding from a company licensed under section 681(c) of this title shall not exceed 300 per centum of the private capital of such company: Provided, That nothing in this paragraph shall require any such company that on March 31, 1993, has outstanding debentures in excess of 300 per centum of its private capital to prepay such excess: And provided further, That any such company may apply for an additional debenture guarantee or participating security guarantee with the proceeds to be used solely to pay the amount due on such maturing debenture, but the maturity of the new debenture or security shall be not later than September 30, 2002.
<br>

<br>(i) In general.—Subject to clause (ii), in calculating the outstanding leverage of a company for purposes of subparagraph (A), the Administrator shall exclude the amount of the cost basis of any Energy Saving qualified investment in a smaller enterprise made in the first fiscal year after December 19, 2007, or any fiscal year thereafter by a company licensed in the applicable fiscal year.
<br>
<br>(ii) Limitations.—
<br>
<br>(I) Amount of exclusion.—The amount excluded under clause (i) for a company shall not exceed 33 percent of the private capital of that company.
<br>
<br>(II) Maximum investment.—A company shall not make an Energy Saving qualified investment in any one entity in an amount equal to more than 20 percent of the private capital of that company.
<br>
<br>(III) Other terms.—The exclusion of amounts under clause (i) shall be subject to such terms as the Administrator may impose to ensure that there is no cost (as that term is defined in section 661a of title 2) with respect to purchasing or guaranteeing any debenture involved.
<br>
<br>(3) Subject to the foregoing dollar and percentage limits, a company licensed under section 681(c) of this title may issue and have outstanding both guaranteed debentures and participating securities: Provided, That the total amount of participating securities outstanding shall not exceed 200 per centum of private capital.
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subsection, the term "venture capital" includes such common stock, preferred stock, or other financing with subordination or nonamortization characteristics as the Administration determines to be substantially similar to equity financing.
<br>(c) Third party debt
<br>
<br>The Administrator—
<br>
<br>(1) shall not permit a licensee having outstanding leverage to incur third party debt that would create or contribute to an unreasonable risk of default or loss to the Federal Government; and
<br>
<br>(2) shall permit such licensees to incur third party debt only on such terms and subject to such conditions as may be established by the Administrator, by regulation or otherwise.
<br>(d) Investments in smaller enterprises
<br>
<br>The Administrator shall require each licensee, as a condition of approval of an application for leverage, to certify in writing that not less than 25 percent of the aggregate dollar amount of financings of that licensee shall be provided to smaller enterprises.
<br>(e) Capital impairment
<br>
<br>Before approving any application for leverage submitted by a licensee under this chapter, the Administrator—
<br>
<br>(1) shall determine that the private capital of the licensee meets the requirements of section 682(a) of this title; and
<br>
<br>(2) shall determine, taking into account the nature of the assets of the licensee, the amount and terms of any third party debt owed by such licensee, and any other factors determined to be relevant by the Administrator, that the private capital of the licensee has not been impaired to such an extent that the issuance of additional leverage would create or otherwise contribute to an unreasonable risk of default or loss to the Federal Government.
<br>(f) Redemption or repurchase of preferred stock
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of law—
<br>
<br>(1) the Administrator may allow the issuer of any preferred stock sold to the Administration before November 1, 1989 to redeem or repurchase such stock, upon the payment to the Administration of an amount less than the par value of such stock, for a repurchase price determined by the Administrator after consideration of all relevant factors, including—
<br>
<br>(A) the market value of the stock;
<br>
<br>(B) the value of benefits provided and anticipated to accrue to the issuer;
<br>
<br>(C) the amount of dividends paid, accrued, and anticipated; and
<br>
<br>(D) the estimate of the Administrator of any anticipated redemption; and
<br>
<br>(2) any moneys received by the Administration from the repurchase of preferred stock shall be available solely to provide debenture leverage to licensees having 50 percent or more in aggregate dollar amount of their financings invested in smaller enterprises.
<br>(g) Guarantee of payment of and authority to purchase participating securities
<br>
<br>In order to encourage small business investment companies to provide equity capital to small businesses, the Administration is authorized to guarantee the payment of the redemption price and prioritized payments on participating securities issued by such companies which are licensed pursuant to section 681(c) of this title, and a trust or a pool acting on behalf of the Administration is authorized to purchase such securities. Such guarantees and purchases shall be made on such terms and conditions as the Administration shall establish by regulation. For purposes of this section, (A) the term "participating securities" includes preferred stock, a preferred limited partnership interest or a similar instrument, including debentures under the terms of which interest is payable only to the extent of earnings and (B) the term "prioritized payments" includes dividends on stock, interest on qualifying debentures, or priority returns on preferred limited partnership interests which are paid only to the extent of earnings. Participating securities guaranteed under this subsection shall be subject to the following restrictions and limitations, in addition to such other restrictions and limitations as the Administration may determine:
<br>
<br>(1) Participating securities shall be redeemed not later than 15 years after their date of issuance for an amount equal to 100 per centum of the original issue price plus the amount of any accrued prioritized payment: Provided, That if, at the time the securities are redeemed, whether as scheduled or in advance, the issuing company (A) has not paid all accrued prioritized payments in full as provided in paragraph (2) below and (B) has not sold or otherwise disposed of all investments subject to profit distributions pursuant to paragraph (11), the company's obligation to pay accrued and unpaid prioritized payments shall continue and payment shall be made from the realized gain, if any, on the disposition of such investments, but if on disposition there is no realized gain, the obligation to pay accrued and unpaid prioritized payments shall be extinguished: Provided further, That in the interim, the company shall not make any in-kind distributions of such investments unless it pays to the Administration such sums, up to the amount of the unrealized appreciation on such investments, as may be necessary to pay in full the accrued prioritized payments.
<br>
<br>(2) Prioritized payments on participating securities shall be preferred and cumulative and payable out of the retained earnings available for distribution, as defined by the Administration, of the issuing company at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average maturities on such securities, adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1 percent, plus, for participating securities obligated after September 30, 2001, an additional charge, in an amount established annually by the Administration, as necessary to reduce to zero the cost (as defined in section 661a of title 2) to the Administration of purchasing and guaranteeing participating securities under this chapter, which amount may not exceed 1.46 percent per year, and which shall be paid to and retained by the Administration.
<br>
<br>(3) In the event of liquidation of the company, participating securities shall be senior in priority for all purposes to all other equity interests in the issuing company, whenever created.
<br>
<br>(4) Any company issuing a participating security under this chapter shall commit to invest or shall invest an amount equal to the outstanding face value of such security solely in equity capital. As used in this subsection, "equity capital" means common or preferred stock or a similar instrument, including subordinated debt with equity features which is not amortized and which provides for interest payments from appropriate sources, as determined by the Administration.
<br>
<br>(5) The only debt (other than leverage obtained in accordance with this subchapter) which any company issuing a participating security under this subsection may have outstanding shall be temporary debt in amounts limited to not more than 50 per centum of private capital.
<br>
<br>(6) The Administration may permit the proceeds of a participating security to be used to pay the principal amount due on outstanding debentures guaranteed by the Administration, if (A) the company has outstanding equity capital invested in an amount equal to the amount of the debentures being refinanced and (B) the Administration receives profit participation on such terms and conditions as it may determine, but not to exceed the per centums specified in paragraph (11).
<br>
<br>(7) For purposes of computing profit participation under paragraph (11), except as otherwise determined by the Administration, the management expenses of any company which issues participating securities shall not be greater than 2.5 per centum per annum of the combined capital of the company, plus $125,000 if the company's combined capital is less than $20,000,000. For purposes of this paragraph, (A) the term "combined capital" means the aggregate amount of private capital and outstanding leverage and (B) the term "management expenses" includes salaries, office expenses, travel, business development, office and equipment rental, bookkeeping and the development, investigation and monitoring of investments, but does not include the cost of services provided by specialized outside consultants, outside lawyers and outside auditors, who perform services not generally expected of a venture capital company nor does such term include the cost of services provided by any affiliate of the company which are not part of the normal process of making and monitoring venture capital investments.
<br>
<br>(8) Notwithstanding paragraph (9), if a company is operating as a limited partnership or as a subchapter S corporation or an equivalent pass-through entity for tax purposes and if there are no accumulated and unpaid prioritized payments, the company may make annual distributions to the partners, shareholders, or members in amounts not greater than each partner's, shareholder's, or member's maximum tax liability. For purposes of this paragraph, the term "maximum tax liability" means the amount of income allocated to each partner, shareholder, or member (including an allocation to the Administration as if it were a taxpayer) for Federal income tax purposes in the income tax return filed or to be filed by the company with respect to the fiscal year of the company immediately preceding such distribution, multiplied by the highest combined marginal Federal and State income tax rates for corporations or individuals, whichever is higher, on each type of income included in such return. For purposes of this paragraph, the term "State income tax" means the income tax of the State where the company's principal place of business is located. A company may also elect to make a distribution under this paragraph at any time during any calendar quarter based on an estimate of the maximum tax liability. If a company makes 1 or more interim distributions for a calendar year, and the aggregate amount of those distributions exceeds the maximum amount that the company could have distributed based on a single annual computation, any subsequent distribution by the company under this paragraph shall be reduced by an amount equal to the excess amount distributed.
<br>
<br>(9) After making any distributions as provided in paragraph (8), a company with participating securities outstanding may distribute the balance of income to its investors, specifically including the Administration, in the per centums specified in paragraph (11), if there are no accumulated and unpaid prioritized payments and if all amounts due the Administration pursuant to paragraph (11) have been paid in full, subject to the following conditions:
<br>
<br>(A) As of the date of the proposed distribution, if the amount of leverage outstanding is more than 200 per centum of the amount of private capital, any amounts distributed shall be made to private investors and to the Administration in the ratio of leverage to private capital.
<br>
<br>(B) As of the date of the proposed distribution, if the amount of leverage outstanding is more than 100 per centum but not more than 200 per centum of the amount of private capital, 50 per centum of any amounts distributed shall be made to the Administration and 50 per centum shall be made to the private investors.
<br>
<br>(C) If the amount of leverage outstanding is 100 per centum, or less, of the amount of private capital, the ratio shall be that for distribution of profits as provided in paragraph (11).
<br>
<br>(D) Any amounts received by the Administration under subparagraph (A) or (B) shall be applied first as profit participation as provided in paragraph (11) and any remainder shall be applied as a prepayment of the principal amount of the participating securities or debentures.
<br>
<br>(10) After making any distributions pursuant to paragraph (8), a company with participating securities outstanding may return capital to its investors, specifically including the Administration, if there are no accumulated and unpaid prioritized payments and if all amounts due the Administration pursuant to paragraph (11) have been paid in full. Any distributions under this paragraph shall be made to private investors and to the Administration in the ratio of private capital to leverage as of the date of the proposed distribution: Provided, That if the amount of leverage outstanding is less than 50 per centum of the amount of private capital or $10,000,000, whichever is less, no distribution shall be required to be made to the Administration unless the Administration determines, on a case by case basis, to require distributions to the Administration to reduce the amount of outstanding leverage to an amount less than $10,000,000.
<br>
<br>(11)(A) A company which issues participating securities shall agree to allocate to the Administration a share of its profits determined by the relationship of its private capital to the amount of participating securities guaranteed by the Administration in accordance with the following:
<br>
<br>(i) If the total amount of participating securities is 100 per centum of private capital or less, the company shall allocate to the Administration a per centum share computed as follows: the amount of participating securities divided by private capital times 9 per centum.
<br>
<br>(ii) If the total amount of participating securities is more than 100 per centum but not greater than 200 per centum of private capital, the company shall allocate to the Administration a per centum share computed as follows:
<br>
<br>(I) 9 per centum, plus
<br>
<br>(II) 3 per centum of the amount of participating securities minus private capital divided by private capital.
<br>
<br>(B) Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph—
<br>
<br>(i) in no event shall the total per centum required by this paragraph exceed 12 per centum, unless required pursuant to the provisions of (ii) below,
<br>
<br>(ii) if, on the date the participating securities are marketed, the interest rate on Treasury bonds with a maturity of 10 years is a rate other than 8 per centum, the Administration shall adjust the rate specified in paragraph (A) above, either higher or lower, by the same per centum by which the Treasury bond rate is higher or lower than 8 per centum, and
<br>
<br>(iii) this paragraph shall not be construed to create any ownership interest of the Administration in the company.
<br>
<br>(12) A company may elect to make an in-kind distribution of securities only if such securities are publicly traded and marketable. The company shall deposit the Administration's share of such securities for disposition with a trustee designated by the Administration or, at its option and with the agreement of the company, the Administration may direct the company to retain the Administration's share. If the company retains the Administration's share, it shall sell the Administration's share and promptly remit the proceeds to the Administration. As used in this paragraph, the term "trustee" means a person who is knowledgeable about and proficient in the marketing of thinly traded securities.
<br>(h) Computation of amounts due under participating securities
<br>
<br>The computation of amounts due the Administration under participating securities shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:
<br>
<br>(1) The formula in subsection (g)(11) shall be computed annually and the Administration shall receive distributions of its profit participation at the same time as other investors in the company.
<br>
<br>(2) The formula shall not be modified due to an increase in the private capital unless the increase is provided for in a proposed business plan submitted to and approved by the Administration.
<br>
<br>(3) After distributions have been made, the Administration's share of such distributions shall not be recomputed or reduced.
<br>
<br>(4) If the company prepays or repays the participating securities, the Administration shall receive the requisite participation upon the distribution of profits due to any investments held by the company on the date of the repayment or prepayment.
<br>
<br>(5) If a company is licensed on or before March 31, 1993, it may elect to exclude from profit participation all investments held on that date and in such case the Administration shall determine the amount of the future expenses attributable to such prior investment: Provided, That if the company issues participating securities to refinance debentures as authorized in subsection (g)(6), it may not elect to exclude profits on existing investments under this paragraph.
<br>(i) Leverage fee
<br>
<br>With respect to leverage granted by the Administration to a licensee, the Administration shall collect from the licensee a nonrefundable fee in an amount equal to 3 percent of the face amount of leverage granted to the licensee in the following manner: 1 percent upon the date on which the Administration enters into any commitment for such leverage with the licensee, and the balance of 2 percent (or 3 percent if no commitment has been entered into by the Administration) on the date on which the leverage is drawn by the licensee.
<br>(j) Calculation of subsidy rate
<br>
<br>All fees, interest, and profits received and retained by the Administration under this section shall be included in the calculations made by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to offset the cost (as that term is defined in section 661a of title 2) to the Administration of purchasing and guaranteeing debentures and participating securities under this chapter.
<br>(k) Energy saving debentures
<br>
<br>In addition to any other authority under this chapter, a small business investment company licensed in the first fiscal year after December 19, 2007, or any fiscal year thereafter may issue Energy Saving debentures.

In this paragraph, the term "interest" includes only the maximum mandatory sum, expressed in dollars or as a percentage rate, that is payable with respect to the business loan amount received by the small business concern, and does not include the value, if any, of contingent obligations, including warrants, royalty, or conversion rights, granting the small business investment company an ownership interest in the equity or increased future revenue of the small business concern receiving the business loan.

<br>
<br>(B) In the case of any loan with respect to which there is a forfeiture of interest under subparagraph (A), the person who paid the interest may recover from a small business investment company making such loan an amount equal to twice the amount of the interest paid on such loan. Such interest may be recovered in a civil action commenced in a court of appropriate jurisdiction not later than two years after the most recent payment of interest.

<br>§687a. Revocation and suspension of licenses; cease and desist orders
<br>(a) Grounds for suspension or revocation
<br>
<br>A license may be revoked or suspended by the Administration—
<br>
<br>(1) for false statements knowingly made in any written statement required under this subchapter, or under any regulation issued under this subchapter by the Administration;
<br>
<br>(2) if any written statement required under this subchapter, or under any regulation issued under this subchapter by the Administrator, fails to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statement not misleading in the light of the circumstances under which the statement was made;
<br>
<br>(3) for willful or repeated violation of, or willful or repeated failure to observe, any provision of this chapter;
<br>
<br>(4) for willful or repeated violation of, or willful or repeated failure to observe, any rule or regulation of the Administration authorized by this chapter; or
<br>
<br>(5) for violation of, or failure to observe, any cease and desist order issued by the Administration under this section.
<br>(b) Grounds for cease and desist order
<br>
<br>Where a licensee or any other person has not complied with any provision of this chapter, or of any regulation issued pursuant thereto by the Administration, or is engaging or is about to engage in any acts or practices which constitute or will constitute a violation of such chapter or regulation, the Administration may order such licensee or other person to cease and desist from such action or failure to act. The Administration may further order such licensee or other person to take such action or to refrain from such action as the Administration deems necessary to insure compliance with this chapter and the regulations. The Administration may also suspend the license of a licensee, against whom an order has been issued, until such licensee complies with such order.
<br>(c) Order to show cause; contents; hearing; issuance and service
<br>
<br>Before revoking or suspending a license pursuant to subsection (a), or issuing a cease and desist order pursuant to subsection (b), the Administration shall serve upon the licensee and any other person involved an order to show cause why an order revoking or suspending the license or a cease and desist order should not be issued. Any such order to show cause shall contain a statement of the matters of fact and law asserted by the Administration and the legal authority and jurisdiction under which a hearing is to be held, and shall set forth that a hearing will be held before the Administration at a time and place stated in the order. If after hearing, or a waiver thereof, the Administration determines on the record that an order revoking or suspending the license or a cease and desist order should issue, it shall promptly issue such order, which shall include a statement of the findings of the Administration and the grounds and reasons therefor and specify the effective date of the order, and shall cause the order to be served on the licensee and any other person involved.
<br>(d) Subpena of person, and books, papers and documents; fees and mileage; enforcement
<br>
<br>The Administration may require by subpena the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of all books, papers, and documents relating to the hearing from any place in the United States. Witnesses summoned before the Administration shall be paid by the party at whose instance they were called the same fees and mileage that are paid witnesses in the courts of the United States. In case of disobedience to a subpena, the Administration, or any party to a proceeding before the Administration, may invoke the aid of any court of the United States in requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, papers, and documents.
<br>(e) Petition to modify or set aside order; filing, time and place, Administration to submit record; action of court; review
<br>
<br>An order issued by the Administration under this section shall be final and conclusive unless within thirty days after the service thereof the licensee, or other person against whom an order is issued, appeals to the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which such licensee has its principal place of business by filing with the clerk of such court a petition praying that the Administration's order be set aside or modified in the manner stated in the petition. After the expiration of such thirty days, a petition may be filed only by leave of court on a showing of reasonable grounds for failure to file the petition theretofore. The clerk of the court shall immediately cause a copy of the petition to be delivered to the Administration, and the Administration shall thereupon certify and file in the court a transcript of the record upon which the order complained of was entered. If before such record is filed the Administration amends or sets aside its order, in whole or in part, the petitioner may amend the petition within such time as the court may determine, on notice to the Administration. The filing of a petition for review shall not of itself stay or suspend the operation of the order of the Administration, but the court of appeals in its discretion may restrain or suspend, in whole or in part, the operation of the order pending the final hearing and determination of the petition. The court may affirm, modify, or set aside the order of the Administration. If the court determines that the just and proper disposition of the case requires the taking of additional evidence, the court shall order the Administration to reopen the hearing for the taking of such evidence, in such manner and upon such terms and conditions as the court may deem proper. The Administration may modify its findings as to the facts, or make new findings, by reason of the additional evidence so taken, and it shall file its modified or new findings and the amendments, if any, of its order, with the record of such additional evidence. No objection to an order of the Administration shall be considered by the court unless such objection was urged before the Administration or, if it was not so urged, unless there were reasonable grounds for failure to do so. The judgment and decree of the court affirming, modifying, or setting aside any such order of the Administration shall be subject only to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon certification or certiorari as provided in section 1254 of title 28.
<br>(f) Enforcement of order
<br>
<br>If any licensee or other person against which or against whom an order is issued under this section fails to obey the order, the Administration may apply to the United States court of appeals, within the circuit where the licensee has its principal place of business, for the enforcement of the order, and shall file a transcript of the record upon which the order complained of was entered. Upon the filing of the application the court shall cause notice thereof to be served on the licensee or other person. The evidence to be considered, the procedure to be followed, and the jurisdiction of the court shall be the same as is provided in subsection (e) for applications to set aside or modify orders.

<br>
<br>The Administration may make such investigations as it deems necessary to determine whether a licensee or any other person has engaged or is about to engage in any acts or practices which constitute or will constitute a violation of any provision of this chapter, or of any rule or regulation under this chapter, or of any order issued under this chapter. The Administration shall permit any person to file with it a statement in writing, under oath or otherwise as the Administration shall determine, as to all the facts and circumstances concerning the matter to be investigated. For the purpose of any investigation, the Administration is empowered to administer oaths and affirmations, subpena witnesses, compel their attendance, take evidence, and require the production of any books, papers, and documents which are relevant to the inquiry. Such attendance of witnesses and the production of any such records may be required from any place in the United States. In case of contumacy by, or refusal to obey a subpena issued to, any person, including a licensee, the Administration may invoke the aid of any court of the United States within the jurisdiction of which such investigation or proceeding is carried on, or where such person resides or carries on business, in requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, papers, and documents; and such court may issue an order requiring such person to appear before the Administration, there to produce records, if so ordered, or to give testimony touching the matter under investigation. Any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof. All process in any such case may be served in the judicial district whereof such person is an inhabitant or wherever he may be found.
<br>(b) Examinations and reports
<br>

Fees collected under this subsection shall be deposited in the account for salaries and expenses of the Administration, and are authorized to be appropriated solely to cover the costs of examinations and other program oversight activities. Every such company shall make such reports to the Administration at such times and in such form as the Administration may require; except that the Administration is authorized to exempt from making such reports any such company which is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 [15 U.S.C. 80a–1 et seq.] to the extent necessary to avoid duplication in reporting requirements.
<br>(c) Examinations of small business investment companies

<br>(7) it has charged an interest rate in excess of the maximum permitted by law:
<br>
<br>Provided, That the Administration may waive the examination (A) for up to one additional year if, in its discretion, it determines such a delay would be appropriate, based upon the amount of debentures being issued by the company and its repayment record, the prior operating experience of the company, the contents and results of the last examination and the management expertise of the company, or (B) if it is a company whose operations have been suspended while the company is involved in litigation or is in receivership.
<br>(d) Valuations
<br>(1) Frequency of valuations
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Each licensee shall submit to the Administrator a written valuation of the loans and investments of the licensee not less often than semiannually or otherwise upon the request of the Administrator, except that any licensee with no leverage outstanding shall submit such valuations annually, unless the Administrator determines otherwise.
<br>(B) Material adverse changes
<br>
<br>Not later than 30 days after the end of a fiscal quarter of a licensee during which a material adverse change in the aggregate valuation of the loans and investments or operations of the licensee occurs, the licensee shall notify the Administrator in writing of the nature and extent of that change.
<br>(C) Independent certification
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>Not less than once during each fiscal year, each licensee shall submit to the Administrator the financial statements of the licensee, audited by an independent certified public accountant approved by the Administrator.
