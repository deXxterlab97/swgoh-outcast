<br>§1618. Revocation of reserved rights; excepted reserve; acquisition of title to surface and subsurface estates in reserve; election of Village Corporations; restoration of land to Elim Native Corporation
<br>(a) Revocation of reserved rights; excepted reserve
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, and except where inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter, the various reserves set aside by legislation or by Executive or Secretarial Order for Native use or for administration of Native affairs, including those created under the Act of May 31, 1938 (52 Stat. 593), are hereby revoked subject to any valid existing rights of non-Natives. This section shall not apply to the Annette Island Reserve established by the Act of March 3, 1891 (26 Stat. 1101) and no person enrolled in the Metlakatla Indian community of the Annette Island Reserve shall be eligible for benefits under this chapter.
<br>(b) Acquisition of title to surface and subsurface estates in reserve; election of Village Corporations
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of law or of this chapter, any Village Corporation or Corporations may elect within two years to acquire title to the surface and subsurface estates in any reserve set aside for the use or benefit of its stockholders or members prior to December 18, 1971. If two or more villages are located on such reserve, the election must be made by all of the members or stockholders of the Village Corporations concerned. In such event, the Secretary shall convey the land to the Village Corporation or Corporations, subject to valid existing rights as provided in section 1613(g) of this title, and the Village Corporation shall not be eligible for any other land selections under this chapter or to any distribution of Regional Corporations funds pursuant to section 1606 of this title, and the enrolled residents of the Village Corporation shall not be eligible to receive Regional Corporation stock.
<br>(c) Restoration of land to Elim Native Corporation
<br>(1) Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(A) approximately 350,000 acres of land were withdrawn by Executive orders in 1917 for the use of the United States Bureau of Education and of the Natives of Indigenous Alaskan race;
<br>
<br>(B) these lands comprised the Norton Bay Reservation (later referred to as Norton Bay Native Reserve) and were set aside for the benefit of the Native inhabitants of the Eskimo Village of Elim, Alaska;
<br>
<br>(C) in 1929, 50,000 acres of land were deleted from the Norton Bay Reservation by Executive order;
<br>
<br>(D) the lands were deleted from the Reservation for the benefit of others;
<br>
<br>(E) the deleted lands were not available to the Native inhabitants of Elim under subsection (b) of this section at the time of passage of this chapter;
<br>
<br>(F) the deletion of these lands has been and continues to be a source of deep concern to the indigenous people of Elim; and
<br>
<br>(G) until this matter is dealt with, it will continue to be a source of great frustration and sense of loss among the shareholders of the Elim Native Corporation and their descendants.
<br>(2) Withdrawal
<br>
<br>The lands depicted and designated "Withdrawal Area" on the map dated October 19, 1999, along with their legal descriptions, on file with the Bureau of Land Management, and entitled "Land Withdrawal Elim Native Corporation", are hereby withdrawn, subject to valid existing rights, from all forms of appropriation or disposition under the public land laws, including the mining and mineral leasing laws, for a period of 2 years from May 2, 2000, for selection by the Elim Native Corporation (hereinafter referred to as "Elim").
<br>(3) Authority to select and convey
<br>
<br>Elim is authorized to select in accordance with the rules set out in this paragraph, 50,000 acres of land (hereinafter referred to as "Conveyance Lands") within the boundary of the Withdrawal Area described in paragraph (2). The Secretary is authorized and directed to convey to Elim in fee the surface and subsurface estates to 50,000 acres of valid selections in the Withdrawal Area, subject to the covenants, reservations, terms and conditions and other provisions of this subsection.
<br>
<br>(A) Elim shall have 2 years from May 2, 2000, in which to file its selection of no more than 60,000 acres of land from the area described in paragraph (2). The selection application shall be filed with the Bureau of Land Management, Alaska State Office, shall describe a single tract adjacent to United States Survey No. 2548, Alaska, and shall be reasonably compact, contiguous, and in whole sections except when separated by unavailable land or when the remaining entitlement is less than a whole section. Elim shall prioritize its selections made pursuant to this subsection at the time such selections are filed, and such prioritization shall be irrevocable. Any lands selected shall remain withdrawn until conveyed or full entitlement has been achieved.
<br>
<br>(B) The selection filed by Elim pursuant to this subsection shall be subject to valid existing rights and may not supercede prior selections of the State of Alaska, any Native corporation, or valid entries of any private individual unless such selection or entry is relinquished, rejected, or abandoned prior to conveyance to Elim.
<br>
<br>(C) Upon receipt of the Conveyance Lands, Elim shall have all legal rights and privileges as landowner, subject only to the covenants, reservations, terms and conditions specified in this subsection.
<br>
<br>(D) Selection by Elim of lands under this subsection and final conveyance of those lands to Elim shall constitute full satisfaction of any claim of entitlement of Elim with respect to its land entitlement.
<br>(4) Covenants, reservations, terms and conditions
<br>
<br>The covenants, reservations, terms and conditions set forth in this paragraph and in paragraphs (5) and (6) with respect to the Conveyance Lands shall run with the land and shall be incorporated into the interim conveyance, if any, and patent conveying the lands to Elim.

"Merchantable Timber" means timber that can be harvested and marketed by a prudent operator.
<br>
<br>(B) Public Land Order 5563 of December 16, 1975, which made hot or medicinal springs available to other Native Corporations for selection and conveyance, is hereby modified to the extent necessary to permit the selection by Elim of the lands heretofore encompassed in any withdrawal of hot or medicinal springs and is withdrawn pursuant to this subsection. The Secretary is authorized and directed to convey such selections of hot or medicinal springs (hereinafter referred to as "hot springs") subject to applicable covenants, reservations, terms and conditions contained in paragraphs (5) and (6).
<br>
<br>(C) Should Elim select and have conveyed to it lands encompassing portions of the Tubutulik River or Clear Creek, or both, Elim shall not permit surface occupancy or knowingly permit any other activity on those portions of land lying within the bed of or within 300 feet of the ordinary high waterline of either or both of these water courses for purposes associated with mineral or other development or activity if they would cause or are likely to cause erosion or siltation of either water course to an extent that would significantly adversely impact water quality or fish habitat.

<br>
<br>(B) To have, in addition to such rights held by Elim, all rights and remedies available against persons, jointly or severally, who cut or remove Merchantable Timber for sale.
<br>
<br>(C) In cooperation with Elim, the right, but not the obligation, to reforest in the event previously existing Merchantable Timber is destroyed by fire, wind, insects, disease, or other similar manmade or natural occurrence (excluding manmade occurrences resulting from the exercise by Elim of its lawful rights to use the Conveyance Lands).
<br>
<br>(D) The right of ingress and egress over easements under section 1616(b) of this title for the public to visit, for noncommercial purposes, hot springs located on the Conveyance Lands and to use any part of the hot springs that is not commercially developed.

<br>(B) Incorporation of terms
<br>
<br>Elim shall incorporate the covenants, reservations, terms and conditions, in this subsection in any deed or other legal instrument by which it divests itself of any interest in all or a portion of the Conveyance Lands, including without limitation, a leasehold interest.

<br>
<br>The owners of lands held within the exterior boundaries of lands conveyed to Elim shall have all rights of ingress and egress to be vested in the inholder and the inholder's agents, employees, co-venturers, licensees, subsequent grantees, or invitees, and such easements shall be reserved in the conveyance to Elim.

Any person who has made a lawful entry prior to August 31, 1971, for any of the foregoing purposes shall be protected in his right of use and occupancy until all the requirements of law for a patent have been met even though the lands involved have been reserved or withdrawn in accordance with Public Land Order 4582, as amended, or the withdrawal provisions of this chapter: Provided, That occupancy must have been maintained in accordance with the appropriate public land law: Provided further, That any person who entered on public lands in violation of Public Land Order 4582, as amended, shall gain no rights.
<br>(c) Mining claims; possessory rights, protection
<br>
<br>(1) On any lands conveyed to Village and Regional Corporations, any person who prior to August 31, 1971, initiated a valid mining claim or location under the general mining laws and recorded notice of said location with the appropriate State or local office shall be protected in his possessory rights, if all requirements of the general mining laws are complied with, for a period of five years and may, if all requirements of the general mining laws are complied with, proceed to patent.
<br>
<br>(2)(A)(i) Subject to valid existing rights, an unpatented mining claim or location, or portion thereof, under the general mining laws that is situated outside the boundaries of a conservation system unit (as such term is defined in the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act) and within the exterior boundaries of lands validly selected by a Village or Regional Corporation pursuant to section 1611 of this title or section 1613(h) of this title and that lapses, is abandoned, relinquished, or terminated, declared null and void, or otherwise expires, after August 31, 1971, because of failure to comply with requirements of the general mining laws (including the mining laws of the State of Alaska), is deemed to be null and void for the purposes of this paragraph. The Secretary shall promptly determine the validity of such claims or locations within conservation system units.
<br>
<br>(ii) Subject to valid existing rights and to subparagraph (B), the lands outside a conservation system unit included in a mining claim or location described in clause (i) shall—
<br>
<br>(I) be considered part of the lands selected pursuant to sections 1611 of this title and 1613(h) of this title by the Village or Regional Corporation described in clause (i); and
<br>
<br>(II) be eligible for conveyance pursuant to this chapter unless specifically identified and excluded from an initial selection application.
<br>
<br>(iii) Subject to valid existing rights and to subparagraph (B), any portion outside a conservation system unit of a mining claim or location described in clause (i) that is situated within the exterior boundaries of lands conveyed prior to October 14, 1992, from selections under section 1611 or section 1613(h) of this title shall be conveyed pursuant to this chapter.
<br>
<br>(B) No lands shall be conveyed pursuant to this subsection if the conveyance would result in the receipt of title to lands in excess of an acreage entitlement under this chapter.
<br>
<br>(3) This section shall apply to lands conveyed by interim conveyance or patent to a Regional Corporation pursuant to this chapter which are made subject to a mining claim or claims located under the general mining laws, including lands conveyed prior to November 2, 1995. Effective on November 2, 1995, the Secretary, acting through the Bureau of Land Management and in a manner consistent with section 1613(g) of this title, shall transfer to the Regional Corporation administration of all mining claims determined to be entirely within lands conveyed to that corporation. Any person holding such mining claim or claims shall meet such requirements of the general mining laws and section 1744 of this title, except that any filings that would have been made with the Bureau of Land Management if the lands were within Federal ownership shall be timely made with the appropriate Regional Corporation. The validity of any such mining claim or claims may be contested by the Regional Corporation, in place of the United States. All contest proceedings and appeals by the mining claimants of adverse decisions made by the Regional Corporation shall be brought in Federal District Court for the District of Alaska. Neither the United States nor any Federal agency or official shall be named or joined as a party in such proceedings or appeals.

<br>(f) Land exchanges
<br>
<br>The Secretary, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the State of Alaska are authorized to exchange lands or interests therein, including Native selection rights, with the corporations organized by Native groups, Village Corporations, Regional Corporations, and the corporations organized by Natives residing in Juneau, Sitka, Kodiak, and Kenai, all as defined in this chapter, and other municipalities and corporations or individuals, the State (acting free of the restrictions of section 6(i) of the Alaska Statehood Act), or any Federal agency for the purpose of effecting land consolidations or to facilitate the management or development of the land, or for other public purposes. Exchanges shall be on the basis of equal value, and either party to the exchange may pay or accept cash in order to equalize the value of the property exchanged: Provided, That when the parties agree to an exchange and the appropriate Secretary determines it is in the public interest, such exchanges may be made for other than equal value.

<br>
<br>If a patent is issued to any Village Corporation for land in the National Wildlife Refuge System, the patent shall reserve to the United States the right of first refusal if the land is ever sold by the Village Corporation. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, every patent issued by the Secretary pursuant to this chapter—which covers lands lying within the boundaries of a National Wildlife Refuge on December 18, 1971, shall contain a provision that such lands remain subject to the laws and regulations governing use and development of such Refuge.
<br>(h) Withdrawals of public lands; termination date
<br>
<br>(1) All withdrawals made under this chapter, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, shall terminate within four years of December 18, 1971: Provided, That any lands selected by Village or Regional Corporations or by a Native group under section 1611 of this title shall remain withdrawn until conveyed pursuant to section 1613 of this title.
<br>
<br>(2) The withdrawal of lands made by section 1610(a)(2) and section 1615 of this title shall terminate three years from December 18, 1971.
<br>
<br>(3) The provisions of this section shall not apply to any withdrawals made under section 1616 of this title.
<br>
<br>(4) The Secretary is authorized to terminate any withdrawal made by or pursuant to this chapter whenever he determines that the withdrawal is no longer necessary to accomplish the purposes of this chapter.
<br>(i) Administration of withdrawn lands; contracting and other authority of Secretaries not impaired by withdrawal
<br>
<br>Prior to a conveyance pursuant to section 1613 of this title, lands withdrawn by or pursuant to sections 1610, 1613, and 1615 of this title shall be subject to administration by the Secretary, or by the Secretary of Agriculture in the case of National Forest lands, under applicable laws and regulations, and their authority to make contracts and to grant leases, permits, rights-of-way, or easements shall not be impaired by the withdrawal.
<br>(j) Interim conveyances and underselections
<br>
<br>(1) Where lands to be conveyed to a Native, Native Corporation, or Native group pursuant to this chapter as amended and supplemented have not been surveyed, the same may be conveyed by the issuance of an "interim conveyance" to the party entitled to the lands. Subject to valid existing rights and such conditions and reservations authorized by law as are imposed, the force and effect of such an interim conveyance shall be to convey to and vest in the recipient exactly the same right, title, and interest in and to the lands as the recipient would have received had he been issued a patent by the United States. Upon survey of lands covered by an interim conveyance a patent thereto shall be issued to the recipient. The boundaries of the lands as defined and conveyed by the interim conveyance shall not be altered but may then be redescribed, if need be, in reference to the plat of survey. The Secretary shall make appropriate adjustments to insure that the recipient receives his full entitlement. Where the term "patent," or a derivative thereof, is used in this chapter unless the context precludes such construction, it shall be deemed to include "interim conveyance," and the conveyances of land to Natives and Native Corporations provided for this chapter shall be as fully effectuated by the issuance of interim conveyances as by the issuance of patents.
<br>
<br>(2) Where lands selected and conveyed, or to be conveyed to a Village Corporation are insufficient to fulfill the Corporation's entitlement under section 1611(b), 1613(a), 1615(b), or 1615(d) of this title, the Secretary is authorized to withdraw twice the amount of unfulfilled entitlement and provide the Village Corporation ninety days from receipt of notice from the Secretary to select from the lands withdrawn the land it desires to fulfill its entitlement. In making the withdrawal, the Secretary shall first withdraw public lands that were formerly withdrawn for selection by the concerned Village Corporation by or pursuant to section 1610(a)(1), 1610(a)(3), 1615(a), or 1615(d) of this title. Should such lands no longer be available, the Secretary may withdraw public lands that are vacant, unreserved, and unappropriated, except that the Secretary may withdraw public lands which had been previously withdrawn pursuant to section 1616(d) of this title. Any subsequent selection by the Village Corporation shall be in the manner provided in this chapter for such original selections.
<br>
<br>(3) In lieu of withdrawal under paragraph (2), land may be segregated from all other forms of appropriation for the purposes described in that paragraph if—
<br>
<br>(A) the Secretary and the Village Corporation enter into an agreement identifying the land for selection; and
<br>
<br>(B) the Village Corporation files an application for selection of the land.
<br>(k) National forest land patents; conditions
<br>
<br>Any patents to lands under this chapter which are located within the boundaries of a national forest shall contain such conditions as the Secretary deems necessary to assure that:
<br>
<br>(1) the sale of any timber from such lands shall, for a period of five years, be subject to the same restrictions relating to the export of timber from the United States as are applicable to national forest lands in Alaska under rules and regulations of the Secretary of Agriculture; and
<br>
<br>(2) such lands are managed under the principle of sustained yield and under management practices for protection and enhancement of environmental quality no less stringent than such management practices on adjacent national forest lands for a period of twelve years.
<br>(l) Land selection limitation; proximity to home rule or first class city and Ketchikan
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, no Village or Regional Corporation shall select lands which are within two miles from the boundary, as it exists on December 18, 1971, of any home rule or first class city (excluding boroughs) or which are within six miles from the boundary of Ketchikan.
<br>(m) Licenses held by Alaska Native regional corporations
<br>
<br>An Alaska Native regional corporation organized pursuant to this chapter, or an affiliate thereof, that holds a Federal Communications Commission license in the personal communications service as of the date of enactment of this section 3 and has either paid for such license in full or has complied with the payment schedules for such license shall be permitted to transfer or assign without penalty such license to any transferee or assignee. No economic penalties shall apply to any transfer or assignment authorized under this section. Any amounts owed to the United States for the initial grant of such licenses shall become immediately due and payable upon the consummation of any such transfer or assignment. Any application for such a transfer or assignment shall be deemed granted if not denied by the Commission within 90 days of the date on which it was initially filed. Any provision of law or regulation to the contrary is hereby amended.

Any corporations resulting from mergers or consolidations further may merge or consolidate with other such merged or consolidated corporations within the same region or with other of the corporations created in said region pursuant to section 1606(d), 1607(a), 1613(h)(2), or 1613(h)(3) of this title.
<br>(b) Terms and conditions of merger; rights of dissenting shareholders; rights and liabilities of successor corporation
<br>
<br>Such mergers or consolidations shall be on such terms and conditions as are approved by vote of the shareholders of the corporations participating therein, including, where appropriate, terms providing for the issuance of additional shares of Regional Corporation stock to persons already owning such stock, and may take place pursuant to votes of shareholders held either before or after January 2, 1976: Provided, That the rights accorded under Alaska law to dissenting shareholders in a merger or consolidation may not be exercised in any merger or consolidation pursuant to this chapter effected while the Settlement Common Stock of all corporations subject to merger or consolidation remains subject to alienability restrictions..1 Upon the effectiveness of any such mergers or consolidations the corporations resulting therefrom and the shareholders thereof shall succeed and be entitled to all the rights, privileges, and benefits of this chapter, including but not limited to the receipt of lands and moneys and exemptions from various forms of Federal, State, and local taxation, and shall be subject to all the restrictions and obligations of this chapter as are applicable to the corporations and shareholders which and who participated in said mergers or consolidations or as would have been applicable if the mergers or consolidations and transfers of rights and titles thereto had not taken place: Provided, That, where a Village Corporation organized pursuant to section 1618(b) of this title merges or consolidates with the Regional Corporation of the region in which such village is located or with another Village Corporation of that region, no provision of such merger or consolidation shall be construed as increasing or otherwise changing regional enrollments for purposes of distribution of the Alaska Native Fund; land selection eligibility; or revenue sharing pursuant to sections 1605(c), 1606(m), 1611(b), 1613(h)(8), and 1606(i) of this title.

In the event that such dividend right is not expressly altered or eliminated by the terms of the merger or consolidation, such class of stockholders shall continue to receive such dividends pursuant to section 1606(j) or (m) of this title as would have been applicable if the merger or consolidation had not taken place and all Village Corporations within the affected region continued to exist separately.
<br>(d) Approval of merger or consolidation by shareholders
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or of any other law, no corporation referred to in this section may merger or consolidate with any other such corporations unless that corporation's shareholders have approved such merger or consolidation.
<br>(e) Conveyance of right to withhold consent to mineral exploration, development, etc., as part of merger or consolidation
<br>
<br>The plan of merger or consolidation shall provide that the right of any affected Village Corporation pursuant to section 1613(f) of this title to withhold consent to mineral exploration, development, or removal within the boundaries of the Native village shall be conveyed, as part of the merger or consolidation, to a separate entity composed of the Native residents of such Native village.

<br>
<br>(3) the term "NANA" means NANA Regional Corporation, Inc., a corporation formed for the Natives of Northwest Alaska pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.
<br>(b) Conveyances of lands and interests in lands
<br>
<br>Except as otherwise provided by this section, the Secretary shall convey to NANA, in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement, lands and interests in lands specified in the Agreement in exchange for lands and interests in lands of NANA, specified in the Agreement, upon fulfillment by NANA of its obligations under the Agreement: Provided, however, That this modified exchange is accepted by NANA within 60 days of September 25, 1985.
<br>(c) Exchange limited to designated lands
<br>
<br>(1) The Secretary shall convey to NANA, pursuant to the provisions of paragraph A(1) of the Agreement, the right, title and interest of the United States only in and to those lands designated as "Amended A(1) Lands" on the map entitled "Modified Cape Krusenstern Land Exchange", dated July 18, 1985. The charges to be made pursuant to paragraphs B(1) and D(27) of the Agreement against NANA's land entitlements under this chapter shall be reduced by an amount equivalent to the difference between that acreage conveyed pursuant to this subsection and the acreage that would have been conveyed to NANA pursuant to paragraph A(1) of the Agreement but for this subsection.
<br>
<br>(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph A(3) of the Agreement, the Secretary shall not convey to NANA any right, title and interest of the United States in the lands described in such paragraph A(3) and the Secretary shall make no charge to NANA's remaining entitlements under this chapter with respect to such lands. Such lands shall be retained in Federal ownership but shall be subject to the easement described in Exhibit D to the Agreement as if the lands had been conveyed to NANA pursuant to paragraph A(3) of the Agreement.
<br>(d) Easement in and to transportation system lands
<br>
<br>(1) There is hereby granted to NANA an easement in and to the lands designated as "Transportation System Lands" on the map entitled "Modified Cape Krusenstern Land Exchange", dated July 18, 1985, for use in the construction, operation, maintenance, expansion and reclamation of the transportation system. Use of the easement for such purposes shall be subject only to the terms and conditions governing the construction, operation, maintenance, expansion and reclamation of the transportation system, as set forth in Exhibit B to the Agreement.
<br>
<br>(2) The easement granted pursuant to this section shall be for a term of 100 years. The easement shall terminate prior to the 100-year term:
<br>
<br>(i) if it is relinquished to the United States; or
<br>
<br>(ii) if construction of the transportation system has not commenced within 20 years of September 25, 1985. Computation of the 20-year period shall exclude periods when construction could not commence because of force majeure, act of God or order of a court; or
<br>
<br>(iii) upon completion of reclamation pursuant to the reclamation plan required by Exhibit B to the Agreement.
<br>
<br>(3) Within 90 days after September 25, 1985, the Secretary shall execute the necessary documents evidencing the grant to NANA of the easement granted by this section.
<br>
<br>(4) Except as regards the trail easement described in Exhibit D to the Agreement (to which the "Transportation System Lands" shall be subject as if such lands had been conveyed to NANA pursuant to paragraph A(1) of the Agreement), access to the lands subject to the easement granted by this section shall be subject to such limitations, restrictions or conditions as may be imposed by NANA, its successors and assigns, but NANA and its successors and assigns shall permit representatives of the Secretary such access as the Secretary determines is necessary for the monitoring required by this section.
<br>(e) Compliance with local laws
<br>
<br>The easement granted by this section makes available land for the transportation system, and is intended to be sufficient to permit NANA to comply with the laws of the State of Alaska which may be necessary to secure financing of the construction of the transportation system and the operation, maintenance or expansion thereof by the State of Alaska or by the Alaska Industrial Development Authority.
<br>(f) Reconveyance of easement by NANA
<br>
<br>The easement granted to NANA by this section may be reconveyed by NANA, but after any such reconveyance the terms and conditions specified in Exhibit B of the Agreement shall continue to apply in full to the easement.
<br>(g) Construction materials taken from borrow sites within easement
<br>
<br>NANA is hereby granted the right to use, develop and sell sand, gravel and related construction materials from borrow sites located within the easement granted pursuant to this section as required for the construction, operation, maintenance, expansion and reclamation of the transportation system, subject to the terms and conditions specified in Exhibit B of the Agreement.
<br>(h) Agreement as governing use of lands
<br>
<br>(1) The construction, operation, maintenance, expansion and reclamation of any portion of the transportation system on any of the lands subject to the easement granted to NANA by this section shall be governed solely by the terms and conditions of the Agreement, including the procedural and substantive provisions of Exhibit B to the Agreement, as if the lands covered by the easement granted to NANA by this section had been conveyed to NANA pursuant to paragraph A(1) of the Agreement.
<br>
<br>(2) The Secretary of the Interior, acting through the National Park Service, shall monitor the construction, operation, maintenance, expansion and reclamation of the transportation system, as provided in the Agreement. Any complaint by any person or entity that any aspect of the construction, operation, maintenance, expansion or reclamation of the portion of the transportation system on the lands subject to the easement granted to NANA by this section is not in accordance with the terms and conditions specified in the Agreement shall be made to the Secretary in writing. The Secretary shall review any such complaint and shall provide to NANA or its successors or assigns and to the complainant a decision in writing on the complaint within 90 days of receipt thereof. If the Secretary determines that the activity made the subject of a complaint is not in accordance with the terms specified in the Agreement, and NANA or its successors or assigns disagrees with that determination, the dispute shall be resolved according to the procedures established in Exhibit B to the Agreement.
<br>(i) Use of construction materials from other sites
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall make available to NANA and its successors and assigns the right to use sand, gravel and related construction materials located in Sections 23, 24, 25, 26, 35 and 36 of Township 26 North, Range 24 West, Kateel River Meridian, Alaska, if the Secretary determines either (1) that use of such sand, gravel or related construction material is necessary because there is no other sand, gravel or related construction material reasonably available for the construction, operation, maintenance, expansion or reclamation of the transportation system; or (2) that use of such sand, gravel or related construction material is necessary in order to construct, operate, maintain, expand, or reclaim the transportation system in an environmentally sound manner, consistent with the requirements of Exhibit B of the Agreement. The right to use such sand, gravel and related construction material shall be subject to the terms and conditions of paragraph A of Exhibit B of the Agreement and such other reasonable terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe.
<br>(j) Congressional consultation as prerequisite to amendment of Agreement
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding paragraph D(23) of the Agreement, the Secretary shall not agree to any amendment to the Agreement without first consulting with the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate and shall transmit copies of the text of any amendment to the Agreement to those Committees at the time of his agreeing to any such amendment.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 92–203, §34, as added Pub. L. 99–96, §1, Sept. 25, 1985, 99 Stat. 460; amended Pub. L. 103–437, §16(a)(5), Nov. 2, 1994, 108 Stat. 4594.)

<br>§1629a. Relinquishment by NANA Regional Corporation, Inc., of lands compact and contiguous to public lands in Cape Krusenstern National Monument
<br>(a) Terms and conditions
<br>
<br>The terms and conditions of this section are solely applicable to the lands described in paragraph A(1) of the Agreement, which is defined by section 1629(a)(1) of this title and modified by section 1629 of this title, and shall not affect the relinquishment by NANA described in section B(1) of such Agreement.
<br>(b) Conveyance of lands to United States
<br>
<br>NANA Regional Corporation, Inc. ("NANA"), may convey by quit-claim deed to the United States all of its interest in the surface and subsurface estate in any lands described in subsection (a) of this section: Provided, however, That NANA can relinquish only lands that are compact and contiguous to other public lands within the Krusenstern National Monument and, if the lands to be relinquished have been disturbed by NANA, the Secretary must first determine that such disturbance has not rendered the lands incompatible with Monument values. Whenever NANA executes a quit-claim deed pursuant to this section, it shall be entitled to designate and have conveyed to it any lands outside the boundaries of the Cape Krusenstern National Monument and any other conservation system unit, as established and defined by the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (Public Law 96–487; 94 Stat. 2371, et seq.), covered by any of its pending selection applications filed under the entitlement provisions of either section 1611(b), 1611(c) or 1613(h)(8) of this title. Lands conveyed to NANA pursuant to this subsection shall be of a like estate and equal in acreage to that conveyed by NANA to the United States. The lands conveyed to NANA pursuant to this subsection shall be in exchange for the lands conveyed by NANA to the United States and there shall be no change in the charges previously made to NANA's land entitlements with respect to the lands conveyed by NANA to the United States. Lands received by NANA pursuant to this subsection are Settlement Act lands.
<br>(c) Relinquishment of interests under filed selection applications
<br>
<br>NANA may relinquish any interest it has under selection applications filed pursuant to this chapter in the surface and subsurface estate in lands described in subsection (a) of this section by formally withdrawing such application pursuant to this section: Provided, however, That NANA can relinquish only interests in lands that are compact and contiguous to other public lands within the Krusenstern National Monument and, if the lands have been disturbed by NANA, the Secretary must first determine that such disturbance has not rendered the lands incompatible with Monument values. Whenever NANA formally withdraws a selection application pursuant to this section, it shall be entitled to designate and have conveyed to it lands outside the boundaries of Cape Krusenstern National Monument and any other conservation system unit, as established and defined by the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (Public Law 96–487; 94 Stat. 2371, et seq.) pursuant to any of its pending selection applications filed under either section 1611(b), 1611(c) or 1613(h)(8) of this title. Lands conveyed to NANA under this subsection shall be of a like estate and equal in acreage to the interest which NANA relinquished, and when the lands are conveyed to NANA, the conveyance shall be charged against the same entitlement of NANA as if the lands had been conveyed pursuant to the relinquished selection applications. Lands received by NANA pursuant to this subsection are Settlement Act lands.
<br>(d) Termination date
<br>
<br>The provisions of this section shall remain in effect only until December 18, 1991.
<br>(e) Effect on NANA's selection rights or entitlement to lands
<br>
<br>Nothing in this section shall be deemed to alter or amend in any way NANA's selection rights or to increase or diminish NANA's total entitlement to lands pursuant to this chapter.

<br>(a) Coverage
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any provision of the articles of incorporation and bylaws of a Native Corporation or of the laws of the State, except those related to proxy statements and solicitations that are not inconsistent with this section—
<br>
<br>(1) an amendment to the articles of incorporation of a Native Corporation authorized by subsections (g) and (h) of section 1606 of this title, subsection (d)(1)(B) of this section, or section 1629c of this title;
<br>
<br>(2) a resolution authorized by section 1629d(a)(2) of this title;

<br>
<br>shall be considered in accordance with the provisions of this section.
<br>(b) Basic procedure
<br>
<br>(1) An amendment or resolution described in subsection (a) may be approved by the board of directors of a Native Corporation in accordance with its bylaws. If the board approves the amendment or resolution, it shall direct that the amendment or resolution be submitted to a vote of the shareholders at the next annual meeting or at a special meeting (if the board, at its discretion, schedules such special meeting). One or more such amendments or resolutions may be submitted to the shareholders and voted upon at one meeting.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) A written notice (including a proxy statement if required under applicable law), setting forth the amendment or resolution approved pursuant to paragraph (1) (and, at the discretion of the board, a summary of the changes to be effected) together with any amendment or resolution submitted pursuant to subsection (c) and the statements described therein shall be sent, not less than fifty days nor more than sixty days prior to the meeting of the shareholders, by first-class mail or hand-delivered to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at his or her address as it appears in the records of the Native Corporation. The corporation may also communicate with its shareholders at any time and in any manner authorized by the laws of the State.
<br>
<br>(B) The board of directors may, but shall not be required to, appraise or otherwise determine the value of—
<br>
<br>(i) land conveyed to the corporation pursuant to section 1613(h)(1) of this title or any other land used as a cemetery;
<br>
<br>(ii) the surface estate of land that is both—
<br>
<br>(I) exempt from real estate taxation pursuant to section 1636(d)(1)(A) of this title; and
<br>
<br>(II) used by the shareholders of the corporation for subsistence uses (as defined in section 3113 of title 16); or
<br>
<br>(iii) land or interest in land which the board of directors believes to be only of speculative value;
<br>
<br>in connection with any communication made to the shareholders pursuant to this subsection.
<br>
<br>(C) If the board of directors determines, for quorum purposes or otherwise, that a previously-noticed meeting must be postponed or adjourned, it may, by giving notice to the shareholders, set a new date for such meeting not more than forty-five days later than the original date without sending the shareholders a new written notice (or a new summary of changes to be effected). If the new date is more than forty-five days later than the original date, however, a new written notice (and a new summary of changes to be effected if such a summary was originally sent pursuant to subparagraph (A)), shall be sent or delivered to shareholders not less than thirty days nor more than forty-five days prior to the new date.
<br>(c) Shareholder petitions
<br>
<br>(1)(A) With respect to an amendment authorized by section 1606(g)(1)(B) of this title or section 1629c(b) of this title or an amendment authorizing the issuance of stock subject to the restrictions provided by section 1606(g)(2)(B)(iii) of this title, the holders of shares representing at least 25 per centum of the total voting power of a Native Corporation may petition the board of directors to submit such amendment to a vote of the shareholders in accordance with the provisions of this section.
<br>
<br>(B) The requirements of the laws of the State relating to the solicitation of proxies shall govern solicitation of signatures for a petition described in subparagraph (A) except that the requirements of Federal law shall govern the solicitation of signatures for a petition that is to be submitted to a Native Corporation which at the time of such submission has issued a class of equity securities registered pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.]. If a petition meets the applicable solicitation requirements and—
<br>
<br>(i) the board agrees with such petition, the board shall submit the amendment and either the proponents' statement or its own statement in support of the amendment to the shareholders for a vote, or
<br>
<br>(ii) the board disagrees with the petition for any reason, the board shall submit the amendment and the proponents' statement to the shareholders for a vote and may, at its discretion, submit an opposing statement or an alternative amendment.
<br>
<br>(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to a Native Corporation that on or before the date one year after February 3, 1988, elects application of section 1629c(d) of this title in lieu of section 1629c(b) of this title. Until December 18, 1991, paragraph (1) shall not apply to a Native Corporation that elects application of section 1629c(c) of this title in lieu of section 1629c(b) of this title. Insofar as they are not inconsistent with this section, the laws of the State shall govern any shareholder right of petition for Native Corporations.
<br>(d) Voting standards
<br>
<br>(1) Except as otherwise set forth in subsection (d)(3) of this section, an amendment or resolution described in subsection (a) shall be considered to be approved by the shareholders of a Native Corporation if it receives the affirmative vote of shares representing—
<br>
<br>(A) a majority of the total voting power of the corporation, or
<br>
<br>(B) a level of the total voting power of the corporation greater than a majority (but not greater than two-thirds of the total voting power of the corporation) if the corporation establishes such a level by an amendment to its articles of incorporation.
<br>
<br>(2) A Native Corporation in amending its articles of incorporation pursuant to section 1606(g)(2) of this title to authorize the issuance of a new class or series of stock may provide that a majority (or more than a majority) of the shares of such class or series must vote in favor of an amendment or resolution described in subsection (a) (other than an amendment authorized by section 1629c of this title) in order for such amendment or resolution to be approved.
<br>
<br>(3) A resolution described in subsection (a)(3) or an amendment to articles of incorporation under section 1606(g)(1)(B) of this title shall be considered to be approved by the shareholders of a Native Corporation if it receives the affirmative vote of shares representing—
<br>
<br>(A) a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy at the meeting relating to the resolution or amendment to articles of incorporation; or
<br>
<br>(B) an amount of shares greater than a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy at the meeting relating to the resolution or amendment to articles of incorporation (but not greater than two-thirds of the total voting power of the corporation) if the corporation establishes such a level by an amendment to its articles of incorporation.
<br>(e) Voting power
<br>
<br>For the purposes of this section, the determination of total voting power of a Native Corporation shall include all outstanding shares of stock that carry voting rights except shares that are not permitted to vote on the amendment or resolution in question because of restrictions in the articles of incorporation of the corporation.
<br>(f) Substantially all of the assets
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section and section 1629e of this title, a Native Corporation shall be considered to be transferring all or substantially all of its assets to a Settlement Trust only if such assets represent two-thirds or more of the fair market value of the Native Corporation's total assets.

<br>§1629c. Duration of alienability restrictions
<br>(a) General rule
<br>
<br>Alienability restrictions shall continue until terminated in accordance with the procedures established by this section. No such termination shall take effect until after July 16, 1993: Provided, however, That this prohibition shall not apply to a Native Corporation whose board of directors approves, no later than March 1, 1992, a resolution (certified by the corporate secretary of such corporation) electing to decline the application of such prohibition.
<br>(b) Opt-out procedure
<br>
<br>(1)(A) A Native Corporation may amend its articles of incorporation to terminate alienability restrictions in accordance with this subsection. Only one amendment to terminate alienability restrictions shall be considered and voted on prior to December 18, 1991. Rejection of the amendment shall not preclude consideration prior to December 18, 1991, of subsequent amendments to terminate alienability restrictions.
<br>
<br>(B) If an amendment to terminate alienability restrictions is considered, voted on, and rejected prior to December 18, 1991, then subsequent amendments to terminate alienability restrictions after December 18, 1991, shall be considered and voted on—
<br>
<br>(i) in the case of an amendment submitted by the board of directors of the corporation on its own motion, not earlier than five years after the rejection of the most recently rejected amendment to terminate restrictions; or
<br>
<br>(ii) in the case of an amendment submitted by the board of directors of the corporation pursuant to a shareholder petition, not earlier than two years after the rejection of the most recently rejected amendment to terminate restrictions.
<br>
<br>(C) If no amendment to terminate alienability restrictions is considered and voted on prior to December 18, 1991, then amendments to terminate alienability restrictions after December 18, 1991, shall be considered and voted on—
<br>
<br>(i) in the case of an amendment submitted by the board of directors of the corporation on its own motion, not more than once every five years; or

<br>(ii) in the case of an amendment submitted by the board of directors of the corporation pursuant to a shareholder petition, not more than once every two years.
<br>
<br>(2) An amendment authorized by paragraph (1) shall specify the time of termination, either by establishing a date certain or by describing the specific event upon which alienability restrictions shall terminate.
<br>
<br>(3) Dissenters rights may be granted by the corporation in connection with the rejection of an amendment to terminate alienability restrictions in accordance with section 1629d of this title.

<br>(c) Recapitalization procedure
<br>
<br>(1)(A) On or prior to December 18, 1991, a Native Corporation may amend its articles of incorporation to implement a recapitalization plan in accordance with this subsection. Rejection of an amendment or amendments to implement a recapitalization plan shall not preclude consideration prior to December 18, 1991, of a subsequent amendment or amendments to implement such a plan. Subsequent amendment or amendments shall be considered and voted on not earlier than one year after the date on which the most recent previous recapitalization plan was rejected. No recapitalization plan shall provide for the termination of alienability restrictions prior to December 18, 1991.
<br>
<br>(B) An amendment or amendments submitted pursuant to subparagraph (A) (and any subsequent amendment submitted pursuant to subparagraph (C)) may provide for the maintenance or extension of alienability restrictions for—

<br>(i) an indefinite period of time;
<br>
<br>(ii) a specified period of time not to exceed fifty years; or
<br>
<br>(iii) a period of time that shall end upon the occurrence of a specified event.
<br>
<br>(C) If an amendment or amendments approved pursuant to subparagraph (A) or this subparagraph maintains or extends alienability restrictions for a specified period of time, termination of the restrictions at the close of such period may be postponed if a further amendment to the articles of incorporation of the corporation is approved to extend the restrictions. There shall be no limit on the number of such amendments that can be approved. Such amendments shall not be effective to extend the restrictions unless approved prior to the expiration of the period of maintenance or extension then in force.
<br>
<br>(D) The board of directors may ask the shareholders to approve en bloc pursuant to a single vote a series of amendments (including an amendment to authorize the issuance of stock pursuant to section 1606(g) of this title) to implement a recapitalization plan that includes a provision maintaining alienability restrictions.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) If an amendment to the articles of incorporation of a Native Corporation maintaining or extending alienability restrictions for a specified period of time is approved pursuant to paragraph (1), the restrictions shall automatically terminate at the end of such period unless the restrictions are extended in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (1)(C).
<br>
<br>(B)(i) A Native Corporation that approves an amendment to its articles of incorporation pursuant to paragraph (1)(B) to maintain or extend alienability restrictions for an indefinite period may later amend its articles to terminate such restrictions. Such amendment shall specify the time of termination, either by establishing a date certain or by describing the specific event upon which the restrictions shall terminate.
<br>
<br>(ii) Rejection of an amendment described in clause (i) by the shareholders shall not preclude consideration of subsequent amendments to terminate alienability restrictions.
<br>
<br>(3) If a recapitalization plan approved pursuant to paragraph (1) distributes voting alienable common stock to each holder of shares of Settlement Common Stock (issued pursuant to section 1606(g)(1)(A) of this title) that carries aggregate dividend and liquidation rights equivalent to those carried by such shares of Settlement Common Stock (except for rights to distributions made pursuant to sections 1606(j) and 1606(m) of this title) upon completion of the recapitalization plan, then such holder shall have no right under section 1629d of this title and any other provision of law to further compensation from the corporation with respect to action taken pursuant to this subsection.
<br>(d) Opt-in procedure
<br>
<br>(1)(A) Subsection (b) shall not apply to a Native Corporation whose board of directors approves, no later than one year after February 3, 1988, a resolution electing the application of this subsection and such resolution is not validly rescinded pursuant to paragraph (2)(B)(ii).

<br>(2)(A) Alienability restrictions imposed on Settlement Common Stock issued by a Native Corporation electing application of this subsection shall terminate on December 18, 1991, unless extended in accordance with the provisions of this subsection.
<br>
<br>(B)(i) The board of directors of a Native Corporation electing application of this subsection shall, at least once prior to January 1, 1991, approve, and submit to a vote of the shareholders, an amendment to the articles of incorporation of the corporation to extend alienability restrictions. If the amendment is not approved by the shareholders, the board of directors may submit another such amendment to the shareholders once or more a year until December 18, 1991.
<br>
<br>(ii) In lieu of approving the amendment to the articles of incorporation described in clause (i) and submitting such amendment to a vote of the shareholders, at any time prior to January 1, 1991, the board of directors of a Native Corporation that has approved a resolution described in paragraph (1)(A) may approve a new resolution rescinding that prior resolution. Upon approval of the new resolution rescinding a resolution described in paragraph (1)(A), the latter resolution shall be void and alienability restrictions on the Settlement Common Stock of such corporation shall continue subsequent to December 18, 1991, until such time as the alienability restrictions are terminated pursuant to the procedure described in subsection (b).
<br>
<br>(iii) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a civil action that challenges the constitutionality of any provision in clause (ii) shall be barred unless it is filed within one year after the date of the vote of the board of directors approving a resolution to rescind a prior opt-in election under paragraph (1)(A). Any such civil action shall be filed in accordance with section 16(b) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act Amendments of 1987 (101 Stat. 1813–1814).
<br>
<br>(C) An amendment submitted pursuant to subparagraph (B) and any amendment submitted pursuant to subparagraph (D) may provide for an extension of alienability restrictions for—
<br>
<br>(i) an indefinite period of time, or
<br>
<br>(ii) a specified period of time of not less than one year and not more than fifty years.
<br>
<br>(D) If an amendment approved by the shareholders of a Native Corporation pursuant to subparagraph (B) or this subparagraph extends alienability restrictions for a specified period of time, termination of the restrictions at the close of such period may be postponed if a further amendment to the articles of incorporation of the corporation is approved to extend the restrictions. There shall be no limit on the number of such amendments that can be approved. Such amendments shall not be effective to extend the restrictions unless approved prior to the expiration of the period of extension then in force.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) If an amendment to the articles of incorporation of a Native Corporation extending alienability restrictions for a specified period of time is approved pursuant to paragraph (2), the restrictions shall automatically terminate at the end of such period unless the restrictions are extended in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (2)(D).
<br>
<br>(B) If the board of directors of a Native Corporation electing application of this subsection does not submit for a shareholder vote an amendment to the articles of incorporation of the corporation in accordance with paragraph (2)(B), or if the amendment submitted does not comply with paragraph (2)(C), alienability restrictions shall not terminate and shall instead remain in effect until such time as a court of competent jurisdiction, upon petition of one or more shareholders of the corporation, orders that a shareholder vote be taken on an amendment which complies with paragraph (2)(C) and such vote is conducted. Following the vote, the status of alienability restrictions shall be determined in accordance with the other provisions of this subsection and the amendment, if approved.
<br>
<br>(4)(A) A Native Corporation that approves an amendment to its articles of incorporation pursuant to paragraph (2) to extend alienability restrictions for an indefinite period of time may later amend its articles of incorporation to terminate the restrictions. Such amendment shall specify the time of termination, either by establishing a date certain or by describing the specific event upon which the restrictions shall terminate.
<br>
<br>(B) The rejection of an amendment described in subparagraph (A) by the shareholders shall not preclude consideration of subsequent amendments to terminate alienability restrictions.
<br>
<br>(5)(A) If a Native Corporation amends its articles of incorporation pursuant to paragraph (2) to extend alienability restrictions, a shareholder who—
<br>
<br>(i) voted against such amendment, and
<br>
<br>(ii) desires to relinquish his or her Settlement Common Stock in exchange for the stock or payment authorized by the board of directors pursuant to subparagraph (B),
<br>
<br>shall notify the Corporation within ninety days of the date of the vote of the shareholders on the amendment of his or her desire.
<br>
<br>(B) Within one hundred and twenty days after the date of the vote described in subparagraph (A), the board of directors shall approve a resolution to provide that each shareholder who has notified the corporation pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall receive either—
<br>
<br>(i) alienable common stock in exchange for his or her Settlement Common Stock pursuant to paragraph (6), or
<br>
<br>(ii) an opportunity to request payment for his or her Settlement Common Stock pursuant to section 1629d(a)(1)(B) of this title.
<br>
<br>(C) This paragraph shall apply only to the first extension of alienability restrictions approved by the shareholders. No dissenters rights of any sort shall be permitted in connection with subsequent extensions of such restrictions.
<br>
<br>(6)(A) If the board of directors of a Native Corporation approves a resolution providing for the issuance of alienable common stock pursuant to paragraph (5)(B), then on December 18, 1991, or sixty days after the approval of the resolution, whichever later occurs, the Settlement Common Stock of each shareholder who has notified the corporation pursuant to paragraph (5)(A) shall be deemed canceled, and shares of alienable common stock of the appropriate class shall be issued to such shareholder, share for share, subject only to subparagraph (B) and to such restrictions consistent with this chapter as may be provided by the articles of incorporation of the corporation or in agreements between the corporation and individual shareholders.
<br>
<br>(B)(i) Alienable common stock issued in exchange for Settlement Common Stock issued subject to the restriction authorized by section 1606(g)(1)(B)(iii) of this title shall bear a legend indicating that the stock will eventually be canceled in accordance with the requirements of that section.
<br>
<br>(ii) Alienable common stock issued in exchange for a class of Settlement Common Stock carrying greater per share voting power than Settlement Common Stock issued pursuant to subsections (g)(1)(A) and (g)(1)(B) shall carry such voting power and be subject to such other terms as may be provided in the amendment to the articles of incorporation authorizing the issuance of such class of Settlement Common Stock.
<br>
<br>(iii) In the resolution authorized by paragraph (5)(B), the board of directors shall provide that each share of Settlement Common Stock carrying the right to share in distributions made to shareholders pursuant to subsections (j) and (m) of section 1606 of this title shall be exchanged either for—
<br>
<br>(I) a share of alienable common stock carrying such right, or
<br>
<br>(II) a share of alienable common stock that does not carry such right together with a separate, non-voting security that represents only such right.
<br>
<br>(iv) In the resolution authorized by paragraph (5)(B), the board of directors may impose upon the alienable common stock to be issued in exchange for Settlement Common Stock one or more of the following—
<br>
<br>(I) a restriction granting the corporation, or the corporation and members of the shareholder's immediate family who are Natives or descendants of Natives the first right to purchase, on reasonable terms, the alienable common stock of the shareholder prior to the sale or transfer of such stock (other than a transfer by will or intestate succession) to any other party, including a transfer in satisfaction of a lien, writ of attachment, judgment execution, pledge, or other encumbrance; or
<br>
<br>(II) any other term, restriction, limitation, or other provision permitted under the laws of the State.
<br>
<br>(C) The articles of incorporation of the Native Corporation shall be deemed amended to implement the provisions of the resolution authorized by paragraph (5)(B).
<br>
<br>(D) Alienable common stock issued pursuant to this subparagraph shall not be subjected to a lien or judgment execution based upon any asserted or unasserted legal obligation of the original recipient arising prior to the issuance of such stock.
<br>
<br>(7)(A) No share of alienable common stock issued pursuant to paragraph (6) shall carry voting rights if it is owned, legally or beneficially, by a person not a Native or a descendant of a Native.
<br>
<br>(B)(i) A purchaser or other transferee of shares of alienable common stock shall, as a condition of the obligation of the issuing Native Corporation to transfer such shares on the books of the corporation, deliver to the corporation or transfer agent, as the case may be, a statement on a form prescribed by the corporation identifying the number of such shares to be transferred to such transferee and certifying—
<br>
<br>(I) that such transferee is or is not a Native or a descendant of a Native;
<br>
<br>(II) that such transferee, if not a Native or a descendant of a Native, understands that shares of such alienable common stock shall not carry voting rights so long as such shares are held by the transferee or any subsequent transferee not a Native or a descendant of a Native;
<br>
<br>(III) that such transferee, if a purchaser, understands that such acquisition may be subject to section 78m(d) of title 15 and the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission promulgated thereunder; and
<br>
<br>(IV) whether such transferee will be the sole beneficial owner of such shares (if not, the transferee must certify as to the identities of all beneficial owners of such shares and whether such owners are Natives or descendants of Natives).
<br>
<br>(ii) The statement required by clause (i) shall be prima facie evidence of the matters certified therein and may be relied upon by the corporation in effecting a transfer on its books.
<br>
<br>(iii) For purposes of this subparagraph, a beneficial owner of a security includes any person (including a corporation, partnership, trust, association, or other entity) who, directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship, or otherwise has or shares—
<br>
<br>(I) voting power, which includes the power to vote, or to direct the voting of, such security; or

<br>(II) investment power, which includes the power to dispose of, or to direct the disposition of, such security.
<br>
<br>(iv) Any person who, directly or indirectly, creates or uses a trust, proxy, power of attorney, pooling arrangement, or any other contract, arrangement, or device with the purpose or effect of divesting such person of beneficial ownership of a security or preventing the vesting of such beneficial ownership as part of a plan or scheme to evade the requirements imposed by this section or section 78m(d) of title 15 shall be deemed for purposes of such sections to be the beneficial owner of such security.
<br>
<br>(C) The statement required by subparagraph (B) shall be verified by the transferee before a notary public or other official authorized to administer oaths in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction of the transferee or in which the transfer is made.
