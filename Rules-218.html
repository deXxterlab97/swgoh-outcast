<br>
<br>(B) charges in violation of applicable charge limitations under section 8904(b); or
<br>
<br>(C) an item or service furnished during a period in which the provider was debarred from participation under this chapter pursuant to a determination by the Office under this section, other than as permitted under subsection (g)(2)(B);
<br>
<br>(2) that a provider of health care services or supplies has knowingly made, or caused to be made, any false statement or misrepresentation of a material fact which is reflected in a claim presented under this chapter; or
<br>
<br>(3) that a provider of health care services or supplies has knowingly failed to provide any information required by a carrier or by the Office to determine whether a payment or reimbursement is payable under this chapter or the amount of any such payment or reimbursement;
<br>
<br>the Office may, in addition to any other penalties that may be prescribed by law, and after consultation with the Attorney General, impose a civil monetary penalty of not more than $10,000 for any item or service involved. In addition, such a provider shall be subject to an assessment of not more than twice the amount claimed for each such item or service. In addition, the Office may make a determination in the same proceeding to bar such provider from participating in the program under this chapter.
<br>
<br>(e) The Office—
<br>
<br>(1) may not initiate any debarment proceeding against a provider, based on such provider's having been convicted of a criminal offense, later than 6 years after the date on which such provider is so convicted; and
<br>
<br>(2) may not initiate any action relating to a civil penalty, assessment, or debarment under this section, in connection with any claim, later than 6 years after the date the claim is presented, as determined under regulations prescribed by the Office.
<br>
<br>(f) In making a determination relating to the appropriateness of imposing or the period of any debarment under this section (where such debarment is not mandatory), or the appropriateness of imposing or the amount of any civil penalty or assessment under this section, the Office shall take into account—
<br>
<br>(1) the nature of any claims involved and the circumstances under which they were presented;
<br>
<br>(2) the degree of culpability, history of prior offenses or improper conduct of the provider involved; and
<br>
<br>(3) such other matters as justice may require.
<br>
<br>(g)(1)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), debarment of a provider under subsection (b) or (c) shall be effective at such time and upon such reasonable notice to such provider, and to carriers and covered individuals, as shall be specified in regulations prescribed by the Office. Any such provider that is debarred from participation may request a hearing in accordance with subsection (h)(1).
<br>
<br>(B) Unless the Office determines that the health or safety of individuals receiving health care services warrants an earlier effective date, the Office shall not make a determination adverse to a provider under subsection (c)(5) or (d) until such provider has been given reasonable notice and an opportunity for the determination to be made after a hearing as provided in accordance with subsection (h)(1).
<br>
<br>(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), a debarment shall be effective with respect to any health care services or supplies furnished by a provider on or after the effective date of such provider's debarment.
<br>
<br>(B) A debarment shall not apply with respect to inpatient institutional services furnished to an individual who was admitted to the institution before the date the debarment would otherwise become effective until the passage of 30 days after such date, unless the Office determines that the health or safety of the individual receiving those services warrants that a shorter period, or that no such period, be afforded.
<br>
<br>(3) Any notice of debarment referred to in paragraph (1) shall specify the date as of which debarment becomes effective and the minimum period of time for which such debarment is to remain effective. In the case of a debarment under paragraph (1), (2), (3), or (4) of subsection (b), the minimum period of debarment shall not be less than 3 years, except as provided in paragraph (4)(B)(ii).
<br>
<br>(4)(A) A provider barred from participating in the program under this chapter may, after the expiration of the minimum period of debarment referred to in paragraph (3), apply to the Office, in such manner as the Office may by regulation prescribe, for termination of the debarment.
<br>
<br>(B) The Office may—
<br>
<br>(i) terminate the debarment of a provider, pursuant to an application filed by such provider after the end of the minimum debarment period, if the Office determines, based on the conduct of the applicant, that—
<br>
<br>(I) there is no basis under subsection (b), (c), or (d) for continuing the debarment; and
<br>
<br>(II) there are reasonable assurances that the types of actions which formed the basis for the original debarment have not recurred and will not recur; or
<br>
<br>(ii) notwithstanding any provision of subparagraph (A), terminate the debarment of a provider, pursuant to an application filed by such provider before the end of the minimum debarment period, if the Office determines that—
<br>
<br>(I) based on the conduct of the applicant, the requirements of subclauses (I) and (II) of clause (i) have been met; and
<br>
<br>(II) early termination under this clause is warranted based on the fact that the provider is the sole community provider or the sole source of essential specialized services in a community, or other similar circumstances.
<br>
<br>(5) The Office shall—
<br>
<br>(A) promptly notify the appropriate State or local agency or authority having responsibility for the licensing or certification of a provider barred from participation in the program under this chapter of the fact of the debarment, as well as the reasons for such debarment;
<br>
<br>(B) request that appropriate investigations be made and sanctions invoked in accordance with applicable law and policy; and
<br>
<br>(C) request that the State or local agency or authority keep the Office fully and currently informed with respect to any actions taken in response to the request.
<br>
<br>(h)(1) Any provider of health care services or supplies that is the subject of an adverse determination by the Office under this section shall be entitled to reasonable notice and an opportunity to request a hearing of record, and to judicial review as provided in this subsection after the Office renders a final decision. The Office shall grant a request for a hearing upon a showing that due process rights have not previously been afforded with respect to any finding of fact which is relied upon as a cause for an adverse determination under this section. Such hearing shall be conducted without regard to subchapter II of chapter 5 and chapter 7 of this title by a hearing officer who shall be designated by the Director of the Office and who shall not otherwise have been involved in the adverse determination being appealed. A request for a hearing under this subsection shall be filed within such period and in accordance with such procedures as the Office shall prescribe by regulation.
<br>
<br>(2) Any provider adversely affected by a final decision under paragraph (1) made after a hearing to which such provider was a party may seek review of such decision in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or for the district in which the plaintiff resides or has his or her principal place of business by filing a notice of appeal in such court within 60 days after the date the decision is issued, and by simultaneously sending copies of such notice by certified mail to the Director of the Office and to the Attorney General. In answer to the appeal, the Director of the Office shall promptly file in such court a certified copy of the transcript of the record, if the Office conducted a hearing, and other evidence upon which the findings and decision complained of are based. The court shall have power to enter, upon the pleadings and evidence of record, a judgment affirming, modifying, or setting aside, in whole or in part, the decision of the Office, with or without remanding the case for a rehearing. The district court shall not set aside or remand the decision of the Office unless there is not substantial evidence on the record, taken as whole, to support the findings by the Office of a cause for action under this section or unless action taken by the Office constitutes an abuse of discretion.
<br>
<br>(3) Matters that were raised or that could have been raised in a hearing under paragraph (1) or an appeal under paragraph (2) may not be raised as a defense to a civil action by the United States to collect a penalty or assessment imposed under this section.
<br>
<br>(i) A civil action to recover civil monetary penalties or assessments under subsection (d) shall be brought by the Attorney General in the name of the United States, and may be brought in the United States district court for the district where the claim involved was presented or where the person subject to the penalty resides. Amounts recovered under this section shall be paid to the Office for deposit into the Employees Health Benefits Fund. The amount of a penalty or assessment as finally determined by the Office, or other amount the Office may agree to in compromise, may be deducted from any sum then or later owing by the United States to the party against whom the penalty or assessment has been levied.
<br>
<br>(j) The Office shall prescribe regulations under which, with respect to services or supplies furnished by a debarred provider to a covered individual during the period of such provider's debarment, payment or reimbursement under this chapter may be made, notwithstanding the fact of such debarment, if such individual did not know or could not reasonably be expected to have known of the debarment. In any such instance, the carrier involved shall take appropriate measures to ensure that the individual is informed of the debarment and the minimum period of time remaining under the terms of the debarment.

<br>
<br>(ii) Physicians and suppliers who have in force participation agreements with the Secretary of Health and Human Services consistent with section 1842(h)(1) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1395u(h)(1)), whereby the participating provider accepts Medicare benefits (including allowable deductible and coinsurance amounts) as full payment for covered items and services shall accept equivalent benefit and enrollee cost-sharing under this chapter as full payment for services described in clause (i). Physicians and suppliers who are nonparticipating physicians and suppliers for purposes of part B of title XVIII of such Act shall not impose charges that exceed the limiting charge under section 1848(g) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w–4(g)) with respect to services described in clause (i) provided to enrollees described in such clause.

The Office of Personnel Management shall notify the Secretary of Health and Human Services if a physician or supplier is found to knowingly and willfully violate this clause on a repeated basis and the Secretary of Health and Human Services may invoke appropriate sanctions in accordance with sections 1128A(a) and 1848(g)(1) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1320a–7a(a), 1395w–4(g)(1)) and applicable regulations.
<br>
<br>(C) If the Secretary of Health and Human Services determines that a violation of this subsection warrants excluding a provider from participation for a specified period under title XVIII of the Social Security Act, the Office shall enforce a corresponding exclusion of such provider for purposes of this chapter.
<br>
<br>(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, and their agents, shall exchange any information necessary to implement this subsection.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) Not later than December 1, 1991, and periodically thereafter, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (in consultation with the Director of the Office of Personnel Management) shall supply to carriers of plans described in paragraphs (1) through (3) of section 8903 the Medicare program information necessary for them to comply with paragraph (1).
<br>

<br>
<br>(B) enforcement procedures will be in place to carry out such paragraph (including enforcement of protections against overcharging of beneficiaries); and

<br>
<br>Pub. L. 99–251, title I, §107, Feb. 27, 1986, 100 Stat. 16, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(a) Findings.—The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>"(1) the treatment of mental illness, alcoholism, and drug addiction are basic health care services which are needed by approximately 40,000,000 Americans each year;
<br>
<br>"(2) treatment of mental illness, alcoholism, and drug addiction is increasingly successful;
<br>
<br>"(3) timely and appropriate treatment of mental illness, alcoholism, and drug addiction is cost effective in terms of restored productivity, reduced utilization of other health services, and reduced social dependence; and
<br>
<br>"(4) mental illness is a problem of grave concern to the people of the United States and is widely but unnecessarily feared and misunderstood.
<br>
<br>"(b) Sense of the Congress.—It is the sense of the Congress—
<br>
<br>"(1) that participants in the Federal employees health benefits program should receive adequate benefits coverage for treatment of mental illness, alcoholism, and drug addiction; and
<br>
<br>"(2) that the Office of Personnel Management should encourage participating health benefits plans to provide adequate benefits relating to treatment of mental illness, alcoholism, and drug addiction (including benefits relating to coverage for inpatient and outpatient treatment and catastrophic protection benefits)."
<br>§8905. Election of coverage
<br>
<br>(a) An employee may enroll in an approved health benefits plan described in section 8903 or 8903a—

<br>(3) for self and family.
<br>
<br>(b) An annuitant who at the time he becomes an annuitant was enrolled in a health benefits plan under this chapter—

<br>
<br>(C) the full period or periods of service beginning with the enrollment which became effective before January 1, 1965, and ending with the date on which he becomes an annuitant;
<br>
<br>whichever is shortest; or
<br>
<br>(2) as a member of the family of an employee or annuitant;
<br>
<br>may continue his enrollment under the conditions of eligibility prescribed by regulations of the Office. The Office may, in its sole discretion, waive the requirements of this subsection in the case of an individual who fails to satisfy such requirements if the Office determines that, due to exceptional circumstances, it would be against equity and good conscience not to allow such individual to be enrolled as an annuitant in a health benefits plan under this chapter 1
<br>
<br>(c)(1) A former spouse may—
<br>
<br>(A) within 60 days after the dissolution of the marriage, or
<br>
<br>(B) in the case of a former spouse of a former employee whose marriage was dissolved after the employee's retirement, within 60 days after the dissolution of the marriage or, if later, within 60 days after an election is made under section 8339(j)(3) or 8417(b) of this title for such former spouse by the retired employee,
<br>
<br>enroll in an approved health benefits plan described by section 8903 or 8903a of this title as an individual or for 2 for self plus one or self and family as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, subject to agreement to pay the full subscription charge of the enrollment, including the amounts determined by the Office to be necessary for administration and reserves pursuant to section 8909(b) of this title. The former spouse shall submit an enrollment application and make premium payments to the agency which, at the time of divorce or annulment, employed the employee to whom the former spouse was married or, in the case of a former spouse who is receiving annuity payments under section 8341(h), 8345(j), 8445, or 8467 of this title, to the Office of Personnel Management.
<br>
<br>(2) Coverage for self plus one or for self and family under this subsection shall be limited to—
<br>
<br>(A) the former spouse; and
<br>
<br>(B) unmarried dependent natural or adopted children (or, in the case of self plus one coverage, not more than 1 such child) of the former spouse and the employee who are—
<br>
<br>(i) under 22 years of age; or
<br>
<br>(ii) incapable of self-support because of mental or physical disability which existed before age 22.
<br>
<br>(d) An individual whom the Secretary of Defense determines is an eligible beneficiary under subsection (b) of section 1108 of title 10 may enroll, as part of the demonstration project under such section, in a health benefits plan under this chapter in accordance with the agreement under subsection (a) of such section between the Secretary and the Office and applicable regulations under this chapter.
<br>
<br>(e) If an employee, annuitant, or other individual eligible to enroll in a health benefits plan under this chapter has a spouse who is also eligible to enroll, either spouse, but not both, may enroll for self and family, or for a self plus one enrollment that covers the spouse, or each spouse may enroll as an individual or for a self plus one enrollment that does not cover the other spouse or a child who is covered under the enrollment of the other spouse. However, an individual may not be enrolled both as an employee, annuitant, or other individual eligible to enroll and as a member of the family.
<br>
<br>(f) An employee, annuitant, former spouse, or person having continued coverage under section 8905a of this title enrolled in a health benefits plan under this chapter may change his coverage or that of himself and members of his family by an application filed within 60 days after a change in family status or at other times and under conditions prescribed by regulations of the Office.
<br>
<br>(g)(1) Under regulations prescribed by the Office, the Office shall, before the start of any contract term in which—
<br>
<br>(A) an adjustment is made in any of the rates charged or benefits provided under a health benefits plan described by section 8903 or 8903a of this title,
<br>
<br>(B) a newly approved health benefits plan is offered, or
<br>
<br>(C) an existing plan is terminated,
<br>
<br>provide a period of not less than 3 weeks during which any employee, annuitant, former spouse, or person having continued coverage under section 8905a of this title enrolled in a health benefits plan described by such section shall be permitted to transfer that individual's enrollment to another such plan or to cancel such enrollment.
<br>
<br>(2) In addition to any opportunity afforded under paragraph (1) of this subsection, an employee, annuitant, former spouse, or person having continued coverage under section 8905a of this title enrolled in a health benefits plan under this chapter shall be permitted to transfer that individual's enrollment to another such plan, or to cancel such enrollment, at such other times and subject to such conditions as the Office may prescribe in regulations.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) In addition to any informational requirements otherwise applicable under this chapter, the regulations shall include provisions to ensure that each employee eligible to enroll in a health benefits plan under this chapter (whether actually enrolled or not) is notified in writing as to the rights afforded under section 8905a of this title.
<br>
<br>(B) Notification under this paragraph shall be provided by employing agencies at an appropriate point in time before each period under paragraph (1) so that employees may be aware of their rights under section 8905a of this title when making enrollment decisions during such period.
<br>
<br>(h)(1) An unenrolled employee who is required by a court or administrative order to provide health insurance coverage for 1 or more children who meets the requirements of section 8901(5) may enroll for self plus one or self and family coverage, as necessary to provide health insurance coverage for each child who is covered under the order, in a health benefits plan under this chapter. If such employee fails to enroll for self plus one or self and family coverage, as necessary to provide health insurance coverage for each child who is covered under the order, in a health benefits plan that provides full benefits and services in the location in which the child or children reside, and the employee does not provide documentation showing that such coverage has been provided through other health insurance, the employing agency shall enroll the employee in a self plus one or self and family enrollment, as necessary to provide health insurance coverage for each child who is covered under the order, in the option which provides the lower level of coverage under the Service Benefit Plan.
<br>
<br>(2) An employee who is enrolled as an individual in a health benefits plan under this chapter and who is required by a court or administrative order to provide health insurance coverage for 1 or more children who meets the requirements of section 8901(5) may change to a self plus one or self and family enrollment, as necessary to provide health insurance coverage for each child who is covered under the order, in the same or another health benefits plan under this chapter. If such employee fails to change to a self plus one or self and family enrollment, as necessary to provide health insurance coverage for each child who is covered under the order, and the employee does not provide documentation showing that such coverage has been provided through other health insurance, the employing agency shall change the enrollment of the employee to a self plus one or self and family enrollment, as necessary to provide health insurance coverage for each child who is covered under the order, in the plan in which the employee is enrolled if that plan provides full benefits and services in the location where the child or children reside. If the plan in which the employee is enrolled does not provide full benefits and services in the location in which the child or children reside, or, if the employee fails to change to a self plus one or self and family enrollment, as necessary to provide health insurance coverage for each child who is covered under the order, in a plan that provides full benefits and services in the location where the child or children reside, the employing agency shall change the coverage of the employee to a self plus one or self and family enrollment, as necessary to provide health insurance coverage for each child who is covered under the order, in the option which provides the lower level of coverage under the Service Benefits Plan.
<br>
<br>(3) The employee may not discontinue the self plus one or self and family enrollment, as necessary to provide health insurance coverage for each child who is covered under the order, in a plan that provides full benefits and services in the location in which the child or children reside for so long as the court or administrative order remains in effect and the child or children continue to meet the requirements of section 8901(5), unless the employee provides documentation showing that such coverage has been provided through other health insurance.
<br>
<br>(i) Any services by an officer or employee under this chapter relating to enrolling individuals in a health benefits plan under this chapter, or changing the enrollment of an individual already so enrolled, shall be deemed, for purposes of section 1342 of title 31, services for emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property.

<br>
<br>Pub. L. 93–246, §§2, 4(b), Jan. 31, 1974, 88 Stat. 4, provided that:
<br>
<br>"Sec. 2. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an annuitant, as defined under section 8901(3) of title 5, United States Code, who is participating or who is eligible to participate in the health benefits program offered under the Retired Federal Employees Health Benefits Act (74 Stat. 849; Public Law 86–724), may elect, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the United States Civil Service Commission, to be covered under the provisions of chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code, in lieu of coverage under such Act.

<br>
<br>1 So in original. Probably should be followed by a period.
<br>
<br>2 So in original. The word "for" probably should precede "self and family".
<br>§8905a. Continued coverage
<br>
<br>(a) Any individual described in subsection (b) may elect to continue coverage under this chapter in accordance with the provisions of this section.
<br>
<br>(b) This section applies with respect to—
<br>
<br>(1) any employee who—
<br>
<br>(A) is separated from service, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, except that if the separation is involuntary, this section shall not apply if the separation is for gross misconduct (as defined under regulations which the Office of Personnel Management shall prescribe); and
<br>
<br>(B) would not otherwise be eligible for any benefits under this chapter (determined without regard to any temporary extension of coverage and without regard to any benefits available under a nongroup contract);
<br>
<br>(2) any individual who—
<br>
<br>(A) ceases to meet the requirements for being considered an unmarried dependent child under this chapter;
<br>
<br>(B) on the day before so ceasing to meet the requirements referred to in subparagraph (A), was covered under a health benefits plan under this chapter as a member of the family of an employee or annuitant; and
<br>
<br>(C) would not otherwise be eligible for any benefits under this chapter (determined without regard to any temporary extension of coverage and without regard to any benefits available under a nongroup contract); and

<br>
<br>(A) is enrolled in a health benefits plan under this chapter;
<br>

<br>
<br>(D) is placed on leave without pay or separated from service to perform active duty; and
<br>
<br>(E) serves on active duty for a period of more than 30 consecutive days.
<br>
<br>(c)(1) The Office shall prescribe regulations and provide for the inclusion of appropriate terms in contracts with carriers to provide that—
<br>
<br>(A) with respect to an employee who becomes (or will become) eligible for continued coverage under this section as a result of separation from service, the separating agency shall, before the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date as of which coverage (including any temporary extensions of coverage) would otherwise end, notify the individual of such individual's rights under this section; and
<br>
<br>(B) with respect to a child of an employee or annuitant who becomes eligible for continued coverage under this section as a result of ceasing to meet the requirements for being considered a member of the employee's or annuitant's family—
<br>
<br>(i) the employee or annuitant may provide written notice of the child's change in status (complete with the child's name, address, and such other information as the Office may by regulation require)—
<br>
<br>(I) to the employee's employing agency; or
<br>
<br>(II) in the case of an annuitant, to the Office; and
<br>
<br>(ii) if the notice referred to in clause (i) is received within 60 days after the date as of which the child involved first ceases to meet the requirements involved, the employing agency or the Office (as the case may be) must, within 14 days after receiving such notice, notify the child of such child's rights under this section.
<br>
<br>(2) In order to obtain continued coverage under this section, an appropriate written election (submitted in such manner as the Office by regulation prescribes) must be made—
<br>
<br>(A) in the case of an individual seeking continued coverage based on a separation from service, before the end of the 60-day period beginning on the later of—
<br>
<br>(i) the effective date of the separation; or
<br>
<br>(ii) the date the separated individual receives the notice required under paragraph (1)(A); or
<br>
<br>(B) in the case of an individual seeking continued coverage based on a change in circumstances making such individual ineligible for coverage as an unmarried dependent child, before the end of the 60-day period beginning on the later of—
<br>
<br>(i) the date as of which such individual first ceases to meet the requirements for being considered an unmarried dependent child; or
<br>
<br>(ii) the date such individual receives notice under paragraph (1)(B)(ii);
<br>
<br>except that if a parent fails to provide the notice required under paragraph (1)(B)(i) in timely fashion, the 60-day period under this subparagraph shall be based on the date under clause (i), irrespective of whether or not any notice under paragraph (1)(B)(ii) is provided.
<br>
<br>(d)(1)(A) Except as provided in paragraphs (4), (5), and (6), an individual receiving continued coverage under this section shall be required to pay currently into the Employees Health Benefits Fund, under arrangements satisfactory to the Office, an amount equal to the sum of—
<br>
<br>(i) the employee and agency contributions which would be required in the case of an employee enrolled in the same health benefits plan and level of benefits; and
<br>
<br>(ii) an amount, determined under regulations prescribed by the Office, necessary for administrative expenses, but not to exceed 2 percent of the total amount under clause (i).
<br>
<br>(B) Payments under this section to the Fund shall—
<br>
<br>(i) in the case of an individual whose continued coverage is based on such individual's separation, be made through the agency which last employed such individual; or
<br>
<br>(ii) in the case of an individual whose continued coverage is based on a change in circumstances referred to in subsection (c)(2)(B), be made through—
<br>
<br>(I) the Office, if, at the time coverage would (but for this section) otherwise have been discontinued, the individual was covered as the child of an annuitant; or
<br>
<br>(II) if, at the time referred to in subclause (I), the individual was covered as the child of an employee, the employee's employing agency as of such time.
<br>
<br>(2) If an individual elects to continue coverage under this section before the end of the applicable period under subsection (c)(2), but after such individual's coverage under this chapter (including any temporary extensions of coverage) expires, coverage shall be restored retroactively, with appropriate contributions (determined in accordance with paragraph (1), (4), or (5), as the case may be) and claims (if any), to the same extent and effect as though no break in coverage had occurred.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) An individual making an election under subsection (c)(2)(B) may, at such individual's option, elect coverage either as an individual or, if appropriate, for self plus one or for self and family.
<br>
<br>(B) For the purpose of this paragraph, members of an individual's family shall be determined in the same way as would apply under this chapter in the case of an enrolled employee.
<br>
<br>(C) Nothing in this paragraph shall be considered to limit an individual making an election under subsection (c)(2)(A) to coverage for self alone.
<br>
<br>(4)(A) If the basis for continued coverage under this section is an involuntary separation from a position, or a voluntary separation from a surplus position, in or under the Department of Defense due to a reduction in force, or the Department of Energy due to a reduction in force resulting from the establishment of the National Nuclear Security Administration—
<br>
<br>(i) the individual shall be liable for not more than the employee contributions referred to in paragraph (1)(A)(i); and
<br>
<br>(ii) the agency which last employed the individual shall pay the remaining portion of the amount required under paragraph (1)(A).
<br>
<br>(B) This paragraph shall apply with respect to any individual whose continued coverage is based on a separation occurring on or after the date of enactment of this paragraph and before—
<br>
<br>(i) December 31, 2016; or
<br>
<br>(ii) February 1, 2017, if specific notice of such separation was given to such individual before December 31, 2016.
<br>
<br>(C) For the purpose of this paragraph, "surplus position" means a position which is identified in pre-reduction-in-force planning as no longer required, and which is expected to be eliminated under formal reduction-in-force procedures.
<br>
<br>(5)(A) If the basis for continued coverage under this section is an involuntary separation from a position in or under the Department of Veterans Affairs due to a reduction in force or a title 38 staffing readjustment, or a voluntary or involuntary separation from a Department of Energy position at a Department of Energy facility at which the Secretary is carrying out a closure project selected under section 44211 of the Atomic Energy Defense Act—
<br>
<br>(i) the individual shall be liable for not more than the employee contributions referred to in paragraph (1)(A)(i); and
<br>
<br>(ii) the agency which last employed the individual shall pay the remaining portion of the amount required under paragraph (1)(A).
<br>
<br>(B) This paragraph shall only apply with respect to individuals whose continued coverage is based on a separation occurring on or after the date of the enactment of this paragraph.

<br>
<br>(i) the individual shall be liable for not more than the employee contributions referred to in paragraph (1)(A)(i); and
<br>
<br>(ii) the National Aeronautics and Space Administration shall pay the remaining portion of the amount required under paragraph (1)(A).
<br>

<br>(ii) encumbered by an employee who has received official certification from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration consistent with the Administration's career transition assistance program regulations that the position is being abolished as a result of the termination of the Space Shuttle Program.
<br>
<br>(e)(1) Continued coverage under this section may not extend beyond—
<br>
<br>(A) in the case of an individual whose continued coverage is based on separation from service, the date which is 18 months after the effective date of the separation;
<br>
<br>(B) in the case of an individual whose continued coverage is based on ceasing to meet the requirements for being considered an unmarried dependent child, the date which is 36 months after the date on which the individual first ceases to meet those requirements, subject to paragraph (2); or
<br>
<br>(C) in the case of an employee described in subsection (b)(3), the date which is 24 months after the employee is placed on leave without pay or separated from service to perform active duty.

<br>(C) so ceases to meet the requirements referred to in subparagraph (A) before the end of the 18-month period beginning on the date of the former employee's separation from service,
<br>
<br>extended coverage under this section may not extend beyond the date which is 36 months after the separation date referred to in subparagraph (C).
<br>
<br>(f)(1) The Office shall prescribe regulations under which, in addition to any individual otherwise eligible for continued coverage under this section, and to the extent practicable, continued coverage may also, upon appropriate written application, be afforded under this section—
<br>
<br>(A) to any individual who—
<br>
<br>(i) if subparagraphs (A) and (C) of paragraph (10) of section 8901 were disregarded, would be eligible to be considered a former spouse within the meaning of such paragraph; but
<br>
<br>(ii) would not, but for this subsection, be eligible to be so considered; and
<br>
<br>(B) to any individual whose coverage as a family member would otherwise terminate as a result of a legal separation.
<br>

<br>
<br>(D) provisions designed to ensure that any coverage pursuant to this subsection does not adversely affect any eligibility for coverage which the individual involved might otherwise have under this chapter (including as a result of any change in personal circumstances) if this subsection had not been enacted.
<br>
<br>(3) In the case of an individual—
<br>
<br>(A) who becomes eligible for continued coverage under this subsection based on a divorce, annulment, or legal separation from a person who, as of the day before the date of the divorce, annulment, or legal separation (as the case may be) was receiving continued coverage under this section based on such person's separation from service under a self plus one enrollment that covered the individual or under a self and family enrollment; and
<br>
<br>(B) whose divorce, annulment, or legal separation (as the case may be) occurs before the end of the 18-month period beginning on the date of the separation from service referred to in subparagraph (A),
<br>
<br>extended coverage under this section may not extend beyond the date which is 36 months after the date of the separation from service, as referred to in subparagraph (A).

<br>§8906. Contributions
<br>
<br>(a)(1) Not later than October 1 of each year, the Office of Personnel Management shall determine the weighted average of the subscription charges that will be in effect during the following contract year with respect to—
<br>
<br>(A) enrollments under this chapter for self alone;
<br>
<br>(B) enrollments under this chapter for self plus one; and
<br>
<br>(C) enrollments under this chapter for self and family.
<br>
<br>(2) In determining each weighted average under paragraph (1), the weight to be given to a particular subscription charge shall, with respect to each plan (and option) to which it is to apply, be commensurate with the number of enrollees enrolled in such plan (and option) as of March 31 of the year in which the determination is being made.
<br>
<br>(3) For purposes of paragraph (2), the term "enrollee" means any individual who, during the contract year for which the weighted average is to be used under this section, will be eligible for a Government contribution for health benefits.
<br>
<br>(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (2), (3), and (4), the biweekly Government contribution for health benefits for an employee or annuitant enrolled in a health benefits plan under this chapter is adjusted to an amount equal to 72 percent of the weighted average under subsection (a)(1)(A) or (B), as applicable. For an employee, the adjustment begins on the first day of the employee's first pay period of each year. For an annuitant, the adjustment begins on the first day of the first period of each year for which an annuity payment is made.
<br>
<br>(2) The biweekly Government contribution for an employee or annuitant enrolled in a plan under this chapter shall not exceed 75 percent of the subscription charge.
<br>
<br>(3) In the case of an employee who is occupying a position on a part-time career employment basis (as defined in section 3401(2) of this title), the biweekly Government contribution shall be equal to the percentage which bears the same ratio to the percentage determined under this subsection (without regard to this paragraph) as the average number of hours of such employee's regularly scheduled workweek bears to the average number of hours in the regularly scheduled workweek of an employee serving in a comparable position on a full-time career basis (as determined under regulations prescribed by the Office).
<br>
<br>(4) In the case of persons who are enrolled in a health benefits plan as part of the demonstration project under section 1108 of title 10, the Government contribution shall be subject to the limitation set forth in subsection (i) of that section.
<br>
<br>(c) There shall be withheld from the pay of each enrolled employee and (except as provided in subsection (i) of this section) the annuity of each enrolled annuitant and there shall be contributed by the Government, amounts, in the same ratio as the contributions of the employee or annuitant and the Government under subsection (b) of this section, which are necessary for the administrative costs and the reserves provided for by section 8909(b) of this title.
<br>
<br>(d) The amount necessary to pay the total charge for enrollment, after the Government contribution is deducted, shall be withheld from the pay of each enrolled employee and (except as provided in subsection (i) of this section) from the annuity of each enrolled annuitant. The withholding for an annuitant shall be the same as that for an employee enrolled in the same health benefits plan and level of benefits.
<br>
<br>(e)(1)(A) An employee enrolled in a health benefits plan under this chapter who is placed in a leave without pay status may have his coverage and the coverage of members of his family continued under the plan for not to exceed 1 year under regulations prescribed by the Office.
<br>
<br>(B) During each pay period in which an enrollment continues under subparagraph (A)—
<br>
<br>(i) employee and Government contributions required by this section shall be paid on a current basis; and
<br>
<br>(ii) if necessary, the head of the employing agency shall approve advance payment, recoverable in the same manner as under section 5524a(c), of a portion of basic pay sufficient to pay current employee contributions.
<br>
<br>(C) Each agency shall establish procedures for accepting direct payments of employee contributions for the purposes of this paragraph.
<br>
<br>(2) An employee who enters on approved leave without pay to serve as a full-time officer or employee of an organization composed primarily of employees as defined by section 8901 of this title, within 60 days after entering on that leave without pay, may file with his employing agency an election to continue his health benefits enrollment and arrange to pay currently into the Employees Health Benefits Fund, through his employing agency, both employee and agency contributions from the beginning of leave without pay. The employing agency shall forward the enrollment charges so paid to the Fund. If the employee does not so elect, his enrollment will continue during nonpay status and end as provided by paragraph (1) of this subsection and implementing regulations.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) An employing agency may pay both the employee and Government contributions, and any additional administrative expenses otherwise chargeable to the employee, with respect to health care coverage for an employee described in subparagraph (B) and the family of such employee.
<br>
<br>(B) An employee referred to in subparagraph (A) is an employee who—

<br>(iv) is placed on leave without pay or separated from service to perform active duty; and
<br>

<br>
<br>(C) Notwithstanding the one-year limitation on coverage described in paragraph (1)(A), payment may be made under this paragraph for a period not to exceed 24 months.
<br>
<br>(f) The Government contribution, and any additional payments under subsection (e)(3)(A), for health benefits for an employee shall be paid—
<br>
<br>(1) in the case of employees generally, from the appropriation or fund which is used to pay the employee;
<br>
<br>(2) in the case of an elected official, from an appropriation or fund available for payment of other salaries of the same office or establishment;
<br>
<br>(3) in the case of an employee of the legislative branch who is paid by the Chief Administrative Officer of the House of Representatives, from the applicable accounts of the House of Representatives; and
<br>
<br>(4) in the case of an employee in a leave without pay status, from the appropriation or fund which would be used to pay the employee if he were in a pay status.
<br>
<br>(g)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), the Government contributions authorized by this section for health benefits for an annuitant shall be paid from annual appropriations which are authorized to be made for that purpose and which may be made available until expended.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) The Government contributions authorized by this section for health benefits for an individual who first becomes an annuitant by reason of retirement from employment with the United States Postal Service on or after July 1, 1971, or for a survivor of such an individual or of an individual who died on or after July 1, 1971, while employed by the United States Postal Service, shall through September 30, 2016, be paid by the United States Postal Service, and thereafter shall be paid first from the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund up to the amount contained in the Fund, with any remaining amount paid by the United States Postal Service.
<br>
<br>(B) In determining any amount for which the Postal Service is liable under this paragraph, the amount of the liability shall be prorated to reflect only that portion of total service which is attributable to civilian service performed (by the former postal employee or by the deceased individual referred to in subparagraph (A), as the case may be) after June 30, 1971, as estimated by the Office of Personnel Management.
<br>
<br>(3) The Government contribution for persons enrolled in a health benefits plan as part of the demonstration project under section 1108 of title 10 shall be paid as provided in subsection (i) of that section.
<br>
<br>(h) The Office shall provide for conversion of biweekly rates of contribution specified by this section to rates for employees and annuitants paid on other than a biweekly basis, and for this purpose may provide for the adjustment of the converted rate to the nearest cent.
<br>
<br>(i) An annuitant whose annuity is insufficient to cover the withholdings required for enrollment in a particular health benefits plan may enroll (or remain enrolled) in such plan, notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if the annuitant elects, under conditions prescribed by regulations of the Office, to pay currently into the Employees Health Benefits Fund, through the retirement system that administers the annuitant's health benefits enrollment, an amount equal to the withholdings that would otherwise be required under this section.
