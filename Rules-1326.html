<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any provision of Federal law requiring the Secretary to approve individual Indian leases of individual Indian trust or restricted land, where the owners of all of the undivided trust or restricted interests in a parcel of land have submitted applications to the Secretary pursuant to subsection (a), and the Secretary has approved such applications under subsection (d), such owners may, without further approval by the Secretary, enter into a lease of the parcel for agricultural purposes for a term not to exceed 10 years.

<br>(d) Approval of applications for owner management
<br>(1) In general

<br>Subject to the provisions of paragraph (2), the Secretary shall approve an application for owner management submitted by a qualified applicant pursuant to this section unless the Secretary has reason to believe that the applicant is submitting the application as the result of fraud or undue influence.

<br>(2) Commencement of owner-managed status
<br>

<br>(e) Validity of leases
<br>
<br>No lease of trust or restricted interests in a parcel of land that is owner-managed under this section shall be valid or enforceable against the owners of such interests, or against the land, the interest or the United States, unless such lease—
<br>
<br>(1) is consistent with, and entered into in accordance with, the requirements of this section; or
<br>
<br>(2) has been approved by the Secretary in accordance with other Federal laws applicable to the leasing of trust or restricted land.
<br>(f) Lease revenues
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall not be responsible for the collection of, or accounting for, any lease revenues accruing to any interests under a lease authorized by subsection (e), so long as such interest is in owner-managed status under the provisions of this section.
<br>(g) Jurisdiction
<br>(1) Jurisdiction unaffected by status
<br>
<br>The Indian tribe with jurisdiction over an interest in trust or restricted land that becomes owner-managed pursuant to this section shall continue to have jurisdiction over the interest to the same extent and in all respects that such tribe had prior to the interest acquiring owner-managed status.
<br>(2) Persons using land
<br>
<br>Any person holding, leasing, or otherwise using such interest in land shall be considered to consent to the jurisdiction of the Indian tribe referred to in paragraph (1), including such tribe's laws and regulations, if any, relating to the use, and any effects associated with the use, of the interest.
<br>(h) Continuation of owner-managed status; revocation
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Subject to the provisions of paragraph (2), after the applications of the owners of all of the trust or restricted interests in a parcel of land have been approved by the Secretary pursuant to subsection (d), each such interest shall continue in owner-managed status under this section notwithstanding any subsequent conveyance of the interest in trust or restricted status to another person or the subsequent descent of the interest in trust or restricted status by testate or intestate succession to 1 or more heirs.
<br>(2) Revocation
<br>
<br>Owner-managed status of an interest may be revoked upon written request of the owners (including the parents or legal guardians of minors or incompetent owners) of all trust or restricted interests in the parcel, submitted to the Secretary in accordance with regulations adopted under subsection (l).1 The revocation shall become effective as of the date on which the last of all such requests has been delivered to the Secretary.
<br>(3) Effect of revocation
<br>
<br>Revocation of owner-managed status under paragraph (2) shall not affect the validity of any lease made in accordance with the provisions of this section prior to the effective date of the revocation, provided that, after such revocation becomes effective, the Secretary shall be responsible for the collection of, and accounting for, all future lease revenues accruing to the trust or restricted interests in the parcel from and after such effective date.
<br>(i) Defined terms

<br>
<br>(A) a person over the age of 18 who owns a trust or restricted interest in a parcel of land; and
<br>
<br>(B) the parent or legal guardian of a minor or incompetent person who owns a trust or restricted interest in a parcel of land.
<br>
<br>(2) For purposes of this section, the term "owner-managed status" means, with respect to a trust or restricted interest, that—

<br>
<br>Except with respect to the specific lease transaction described in paragraph (1) of subsection (c), interests that acquire owner-managed status under the provisions of this section shall continue to be subject to all Federal laws requiring the Secretary to approve transactions involving trust or restricted land (including leases with terms of a duration in excess of 10 years) that would otherwise apply to such interests if the interests had not acquired owner-managed status under this section.
<br>(k) Effect of section
<br>

<br>SUBCHAPTER I—GENERAL PROVISIONS
<br>§2401. Congressional findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds and declares that—
<br>
<br>(1) the Federal Government has a historical relationship and unique legal and moral responsibility to Indian tribes and their members,
<br>
<br>(2) included in this responsibility is the treaty, statutory, and historical obligation to assist the Indian tribes in meeting the health and social needs of their members,
<br>
<br>(3) alcoholism and alcohol and substance abuse is the most severe health and social problem facing Indian tribes and people today and nothing is more costly to Indian people than the consequences of alcohol and substance abuse measured in physical, mental, social, and economic terms,
<br>
<br>(4) alcohol and substance abuse is the leading generic risk factor among Indians, and Indians die from alcoholism at over 4 times the age-adjusted rates for the United States population and alcohol and substance misuse results in a rate of years of potential life lost nearly 5 times that of the United States,
<br>
<br>(5) 4 of the top 10 causes of death among Indians are alcohol and drug related injuries (18 percent of all deaths), chronic liver disease and cirrhosis (5 percent), suicide (3 percent), and homicide (3 percent),
<br>
<br>(6) primarily because deaths from unintentional injuries and violence occur disproportionately among young people, the age-specific death rate for Indians is approximately double the United States rate for the 15 to 45 age group,
<br>
<br>(7) Indians between the ages of 15 and 24 years of age are more than 2 times as likely to commit suicide as the general population and approximately 80 percent of those suicides are alcohol-related,
<br>
<br>(8) Indians between the ages of 15 and 24 years of age are twice as likely as the general population to die in automobile accidents, 75 percent of which are alcohol-related,
<br>
<br>(9) the Indian Health Service, which is charged with treatment and rehabilitation efforts, has directed only 1 percent of its budget for alcohol and substance abuse problems,
<br>
<br>(10) the Bureau of Indian Affairs, which has responsibility for programs in education, social services, law enforcement, and other areas, has assumed little responsibility for coordinating its various efforts to focus on the epidemic of alcohol and substance abuse among Indian people,
<br>
<br>(11) this lack of emphasis and priority continues despite the fact that Bureau of Indian Affairs and Indian Health Service officials publicly acknowledge that alcohol and substance abuse among Indians is the most serious health and social problem facing the Indian people, and
<br>
<br>(12) the Indian tribes have the primary responsibility for protecting and ensuring the well-being of their members and the resources made available under this chapter will assist Indian tribes in meeting that responsibility.

Where the use of Federal facilities, property, or equipment under subsection (a) furthers the purposes and goals of this chapter, the use of funds other than those funds appropriated to the Department of the Interior, the Department of Justice, or the Department of Health and Human Services to meet the additional costs associated with such use shall not constitute an augmentation of Federal appropriations.
<br>(c) Leases
<br>
<br>(1) The Secretary of the Interior, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services are authorized to enter into long-term leases of tribally owned or leased facilities to house programs established by this chapter where they determine that there is no Federal facility reasonably available for such purpose and the cost of constructing a new Federal facility would exceed the cost of such Federal lease unless they determine that mitigating factors favor such a lease.
<br>
<br>(2) A tribally owned or leased facility may be leased pursuant to this authority to house a regional treatment center to be established pursuant to section 2474(b) 1 of this title only if all the tribes within the Indian Health Service area to be served by such regional treatment center initially consent to such Federal lease.
