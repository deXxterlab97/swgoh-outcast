<br>§390c. Water reservoirs; interests of States and local agencies in storage space
<br>
<br>Cognizant that many States and local interests have in the past contributed to the Government, or have contracted to pay to the Government over a specified period of years, money equivalent to the cost of providing for them water storage space at Government-owned dams and reservoirs, constructed by the Corps of Engineers of the United States Army, and that such practices will continue, and, that no law defines the duration of their interest in such storage space, and realizing that such States and local interests assume the obligation of paying substantially their portion of the cost of providing such facilities, their right to use may be continued during the existence of the facility as hereinafter provided.

<br>§390d. Dams and reservoirs wherein costs thereof, or rights thereto, have been acquired by local interests
<br>
<br>Sections 390c to 390f of this title are applicable to all dams and reservoirs heretofore or hereafter constructed by the United States Government (acting through the Corps of Engineers of the United States Army) wherein either a part of the construction cost thereof shall have been contributed or may be contributed by States or local interests (hereinafter called "local interests") or local interests have acquired or may acquire rights to utilize certain storage space thereof by making payments during the period of such use as specified in the agreement with the Government and wherein the amount of money paid, exclusive of interest, is equivalent to the cost of providing that part of such dam and reservoir which is allocated to such use, whether such share of cost shall have been determined by the "incremental cost" method or by the "separable costs-remaining benefits" method or by any other method. Included among the dams and reservoirs affected by sections 390c to 390f of this title are those constructed by the Corps of Engineers of the Department of the Army, but nothing in sections 390c to 390f of this title shall be construed to affect or modify section 390 of this title.

<br>
<br>The right thus acquired by any such local interest is declared to be available to the local interest so long as the space designated for that purpose may be physically available, taking into account such equitable reallocation of reservoir storage capacities among the purposes served by the project as may be necessary due to sedimentation, and not limited to the term of years which may be prescribed in any lease agreement or other agreement with the Government, but the enjoyment of such right will remain subject to performance of its obligations prescribed in such lease agreement or agreement executed in reference thereto. Such obligations will include continued payment of annual operation and maintenance costs allocated to water supply. In addition, local interests shall bear the costs allocated to the water supply of any necessary reconstruction, rehabilitation, or replacement of project features which may be required to continue satisfactory operation of the project. Any affected local interest may utilize such facility so long as it is operated by the Government. In the event that the Government concludes that it can no longer usefully and economically maintain and operate such facility, the responsible department or agency of the Government is authorized to negotiate a contract with the affected local interest under which the local interest may continue to operate such part of the facility as is necessary for utilization of the storage space allocated to it, under terms which will protect the public interest and provided that the Government is effectively absolved from all liability in connection with such operation.

<br>
<br>During phase I, the Bureau, in consultation with the High Plains States and other Reclamation Act States and other appropriate departments and agencies of the United States, including the United States Geological Survey, shall develop a detailed plan of demonstration projects the purpose of which is to determine whether various recharge technologies may be applied to diverse geologic and hydrologic conditions represented in the High Plains States and other Reclamation Act States. In the preparation and development of such plan, the Bureau shall make maximum use of data, planning studies and other technical resources and assistance available from State and local entities: Provided, That contributions of such technical resources and assistance may be counted as part of the inkind services or other State contribution, but shall otherwise be provided without compensation to the State or local entity. This plan shall contain the selection of not less than a total of twelve demonstration project sites in High Plains States and not less than a total of nine demonstration project sites in other Reclamation Act States. Demonstration project sites shall be confined to areas having a declining water table, an available surface water supply, and a high probability of physical, chemical, and economic feasibility for recharge of the groundwater reservoir. The plan shall provide for demonstration of the application of recharge technology and the selection of water sources, determination of necessary physical works and the operation of water replacement systems, formulation of a monitoring program, identification of any economic, legal, intergovernmental, and environmental issues and projection of planning problems associated with such systems, and recommendation of legislative and administrative actions as may be necessary to carry out phase II.
<br>(b) Recommendation of demonstration projects
<br>
<br>During phase I the Bureau is authorized and directed to recommend demonstration projects to be designed, constructed, and operated during phase II.
<br>(c) Preliminary selection of projects
<br>
<br>Within six months, after the enactment of an appropriation Act to carry out phase I, the Secretary shall make a preliminary selection of projects to receive further planning and development and shall initiate such further planning and development for those selected projects.
