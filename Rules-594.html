<br>SUBCHAPTER IV—EQUAL CREDIT OPPORTUNITY
<br>§1691. Scope of prohibition
<br>(a) Activities constituting discrimination
<br>
<br>It shall be unlawful for any creditor to discriminate against any applicant, with respect to any aspect of a credit transaction—
<br>
<br>(1) on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex or marital status, or age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract);
<br>
<br>(2) because all or part of the applicant's income derives from any public assistance program; or
<br>
<br>(3) because the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under this chapter.
<br>(b) Activities not constituting discrimination
<br>
<br>It shall not constitute discrimination for purposes of this subchapter for a creditor—
<br>
<br>(1) to make an inquiry of marital status if such inquiry is for the purpose of ascertaining the creditor's rights and remedies applicable to the particular extension of credit and not to discriminate in a determination of credit-worthiness;
<br>
<br>(2) to make an inquiry of the applicant's age or of whether the applicant's income derives from any public assistance program if such inquiry is for the purpose of determining the amount and probable continuance of income levels, credit history, or other pertinent element of credit-worthiness as provided in regulations of the Bureau;
<br>
<br>(3) to use any empirically derived credit system which considers age if such system is demonstrably and statistically sound in accordance with regulations of the Bureau, except that in the operation of such system the age of an elderly applicant may not be assigned a negative factor or value;
<br>
<br>(4) to make an inquiry or to consider the age of an elderly applicant when the age of such applicant is to be used by the creditor in the extension of credit in favor of such applicant; or
<br>
<br>(5) to make an inquiry under section 1691c–2 of this title, in accordance with the requirements of that section.
<br>(c) Additional activities not constituting discrimination
<br>
<br>It is not a violation of this section for a creditor to refuse to extend credit offered pursuant to—
<br>
<br>(1) any credit assistance program expressly authorized by law for an economically disadvantaged class of persons;
<br>
<br>(2) any credit assistance program administered by a nonprofit organization for its members or an economically disadvantaged class of persons; or
<br>
<br>(3) any special purpose credit program offered by a profit-making organization to meet special social needs which meets standards prescribed in regulations by the Bureau;
<br>
<br>if such refusal is required by or made pursuant to such program.
<br>(d) Reason for adverse action; procedure applicable; "adverse action" defined
<br>
<br>(1) Within thirty days (or such longer reasonable time as specified in regulations of the Bureau for any class of credit transaction) after receipt of a completed application for credit, a creditor shall notify the applicant of its action on the application.
<br>
<br>(2) Each applicant against whom adverse action is taken shall be entitled to a statement of reasons for such action from the creditor. A creditor satisfies this obligation by—
<br>
<br>(A) providing statements of reasons in writing as a matter of course to applicants against whom adverse action is taken; or
<br>
<br>(B) giving written notification of adverse action which discloses (i) the applicant's right to a statement of reasons within thirty days after receipt by the creditor of a request made within sixty days after such notification, and (ii) the identity of the person or office from which such statement may be obtained. Such statement may be given orally if the written notification advises the applicant of his right to have the statement of reasons confirmed in writing on written request.
<br>
<br>(3) A statement of reasons meets the requirements of this section only if it contains the specific reasons for the adverse action taken.
<br>
<br>(4) Where a creditor has been requested by a third party to make a specific extension of credit directly or indirectly to an applicant, the notification and statement of reasons required by this subsection may be made directly by such creditor, or indirectly through the third party, provided in either case that the identity of the creditor is disclosed.
<br>
<br>(5) The requirements of paragraph (2), (3), or (4) may be satisfied by verbal statements or notifications in the case of any creditor who did not act on more than one hundred and fifty applications during the calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the adverse action is taken, as determined under regulations of the Bureau.
<br>
<br>(6) For purposes of this subsection, the term "adverse action" means a denial or revocation of credit, a change in the terms of an existing credit arrangement, or a refusal to grant credit in substantially the amount or on substantially the terms requested. Such term does not include a refusal to extend additional credit under an existing credit arrangement where the applicant is delinquent or otherwise in default, or where such additional credit would exceed a previously established credit limit.
<br>(e) Copies furnished to applicants
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Each creditor shall furnish to an applicant a copy of any and all written appraisals and valuations developed in connection with the applicant's application for a loan that is secured or would have been secured by a first lien on a dwelling promptly upon completion, but in no case later than 3 days prior to the closing of the loan, whether the creditor grants or denies the applicant's request for credit or the application is incomplete or withdrawn.
<br>(2) Waiver
<br>
<br>The applicant may waive the 3 day requirement provided for in paragraph (1), except where otherwise required in law.
<br>(3) Reimbursement
<br>
<br>The applicant may be required to pay a reasonable fee to reimburse the creditor for the cost of the appraisal, except where otherwise required in law.
<br>(4) Free copy
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding paragraph (3), the creditor shall provide a copy of each written appraisal or valuation at no additional cost to the applicant.
<br>(5) Notification to applicants
<br>
<br>At the time of application, the creditor shall notify an applicant in writing of the right to receive a copy of each written appraisal and valuation under this subsection.
<br>(6) Valuation defined
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subsection, the term "valuation" shall include any estimate of the value of a dwelling developed in connection with a creditor's decision to provide credit, including those values developed pursuant to a policy of a government sponsored enterprise or by an automated valuation model, a broker price opinion, or other methodology or mechanism.

<br>§1691d. Applicability of other laws
<br>(a) Requests for signature of husband and wife for creation of valid lien, etc.
<br>
<br>A request for the signature of both parties to a marriage for the purpose of creating a valid lien, passing clear title, waiving inchoate rights to property, or assigning earnings, shall not constitute discrimination under this subchapter: Provided, however, That this provision shall not be construed to permit a creditor to take sex or marital status into account in connection with the evaluation of creditworthiness of any applicant.
<br>(b) State property laws affecting creditworthiness
<br>
<br>Consideration or application of State property laws directly or indirectly affecting creditworthiness shall not constitute discrimination for purposes of this subchapter.
<br>(c) State laws prohibiting separate extension of consumer credit to husband and wife
<br>
<br>Any provision of State law which prohibits the separate extension of consumer credit to each party to a marriage shall not apply in any case where each party to a marriage voluntarily applies for separate credit from the same creditor: Provided, That in any case where such a State law is so preempted, each party to the marriage shall be solely responsible for the debt so contracted.
<br>(d) Combining credit accounts of husband and wife with same creditor to determine permissible finance charges or loan ceilings under Federal or State laws
<br>
<br>When each party to a marriage separately and voluntarily applies for and obtains separate credit accounts with the same creditor, those accounts shall not be aggregated or otherwise combined for purposes of determining permissible finance charges or permissible loan ceilings under the laws of any State or of the United States.
<br>(e) Election of remedies under subchapter or State law; nature of relief determining applicability
<br>
<br>Where the same act or omission constitutes a violation of this subchapter and of applicable State law, a person aggrieved by such conduct may bring a legal action to recover monetary damages either under this subchapter or under such State law, but not both. This election of remedies shall not apply to court actions in which the relief sought does not include monetary damages or to administrative actions.
<br>(f) Compliance with inconsistent State laws; determination of inconsistency
<br>
<br>This subchapter does not annul, alter, or affect, or exempt any person subject to the provisions of this subchapter from complying with, the laws of any State with respect to credit discrimination, except to the extent that those laws are inconsistent with any provision of this subchapter, and then only to the extent of the inconsistency. The Bureau is authorized to determine whether such inconsistencies exist. The Bureau may not determine that any State law is inconsistent with any provision of this subchapter if the Bureau determines that such law gives greater protection to the applicant.
<br>(g) Exemption by regulation of credit transactions covered by State law; failure to comply with State law
<br>
<br>The Bureau shall by regulation exempt from the requirements of sections 1691 and 1691a of this title any class of credit transactions within any State if it determines that under the law of that State that class of transactions is subject to requirements substantially similar to those imposed under this subchapter or that such law gives greater protection to the applicant, and that there is adequate provision for enforcement. Failure to comply with any requirement of such State law in any transaction so exempted shall constitute a violation of this subchapter for the purposes of section 1691e of this title.

<br>Any creditor who fails to comply with any requirement imposed under this subchapter shall be liable to the aggrieved applicant for any actual damages sustained by such applicant acting either in an individual capacity or as a member of a class.

In determining the amount of such damages in any action, the court shall consider, among other relevant factors, the amount of any actual damages awarded, the frequency and persistence of failures of compliance by the creditor, the resources of the creditor, the number of persons adversely affected, and the extent to which the creditor's failure of compliance was intentional.
<br>(c) Action for equitable and declaratory relief
<br>
<br>Upon application by an aggrieved applicant, the appropriate United States district court or any other court of competent jurisdiction may grant such equitable and declaratory relief as is necessary to enforce the requirements imposed under this subchapter.

<br>In the case of any successful action under subsection (a), (b), or (c), the costs of the action, together with a reasonable attorney's fee as determined by the court, shall be added to any damages awarded by the court under such subsection.

<br>(f) Jurisdiction of courts; time for maintenance of action; exceptions
<br>
<br>Any action under this section may be brought in the appropriate United States district court without regard to the amount in controversy, or in any other court of competent jurisdiction. No such action shall be brought later than 5 years after the date of the occurrence of the violation, except that—
<br>
<br>(1) whenever any agency having responsibility for administrative enforcement under section 1691c of this title commences an enforcement proceeding within 5 years after the date of the occurrence of the violation,
<br>
<br>(2) whenever the Attorney General commences a civil action under this section within 5 years after the date of the occurrence of the violation,
<br>
<br>then any applicant who has been a victim of the discrimination which is the subject of such proceeding or civil action may bring an action under this section not later than one year after the commencement of that proceeding or action.
<br>(g) Request by responsible enforcement agency to Attorney General for civil action
<br>
<br>The agencies having responsibility for administrative enforcement under section 1691c of this title, if unable to obtain compliance with section 1691 of this title, are authorized to refer the matter to the Attorney General with a recommendation that an appropriate civil action be instituted. Each agency referred to in paragraphs (1), (2), and (9) of section 1691c(a) of this title shall refer the matter to the Attorney General whenever the agency has reason to believe that 1 or more creditors has engaged in a pattern or practice of discouraging or denying applications for credit in violation of section 1691(a) of this title.

<br>(i) Recovery under both subchapter and fair housing enforcement provisions prohibited for violation based on same transaction
<br>
<br>No person aggrieved by a violation of this subchapter and by a violation of section 3605 of title 42 shall recover under this subchapter and section 3612 1 of title 42, if such violation is based on the same transaction.
<br>(j) Discovery of creditor's granting standards
<br>
<br>Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to prohibit the discovery of a creditor's credit granting standards under appropriate discovery procedures in the court or agency in which an action or proceeding is brought.
<br>(k) Notice to HUD of violations
<br>
<br>Whenever an agency referred to in paragraph (1), (2), or (3) 1 of section 1691c(a) of this title—
<br>
<br>(1) has reason to believe, as a result of receiving a consumer complaint, conducting a consumer compliance examination, or otherwise, that a violation of this subchapter has occurred;
<br>
<br>(2) has reason to believe that the alleged violation would be a violation of the Fair Housing Act [42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.]; and
<br>
<br>(3) does not refer the matter to the Attorney General pursuant to subsection (g),
<br>

<br>SUBCHAPTER V—DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES
<br>§1692. Congressional findings and declaration of purpose
<br>(a) Abusive practices
<br>
<br>There is abundant evidence of the use of abusive, deceptive, and unfair debt collection practices by many debt collectors. Abusive debt collection practices contribute to the number of personal bankruptcies, to marital instability, to the loss of jobs, and to invasions of individual privacy.
<br>(b) Inadequacy of laws
<br>
<br>Existing laws and procedures for redressing these injuries are inadequate to protect consumers.
<br>(c) Available non-abusive collection methods
<br>
<br>Means other than misrepresentation or other abusive debt collection practices are available for the effective collection of debts.
<br>(d) Interstate commerce
<br>
<br>Abusive debt collection practices are carried on to a substantial extent in interstate commerce and through means and instrumentalities of such commerce. Even where abusive debt collection practices are purely intrastate in character, they nevertheless directly affect interstate commerce.
<br>(e) Purposes
<br>
<br>It is the purpose of this subchapter to eliminate abusive debt collection practices by debt collectors, to insure that those debt collectors who refrain from using abusive debt collection practices are not competitively disadvantaged, and to promote consistent State action to protect consumers against debt collection abuses.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 90–321, title VIII, §802, as added Pub. L. 95–109, Sept. 20, 1977, 91 Stat. 874.)
<br>Effective Date
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 90–321, title VIII, §819, formerly §818, as added by Pub. L. 95–109, Sept. 20, 1977, 91 Stat. 883, §818; renumbered §819, Pub. L. 109–351, title VIII, §801(a)(1), Oct. 13, 2006, 120 Stat. 2004, provided that: "This title [enacting this subchapter] takes effect upon the expiration of six months after the date of its enactment [Sept. 20, 1977], but section 809 [section 1692g of this title] shall apply only with respect to debts for which the initial attempt to collect occurs after such effective date."

<br>
<br>(1) to advise the consumer that the debt collector's further efforts are being terminated;

<br>
<br>(4) a statement that if the consumer notifies the debt collector in writing within the thirty-day period that the debt, or any portion thereof, is disputed, the debt collector will obtain verification of the debt or a copy of a judgment against the consumer and a copy of such verification or judgment will be mailed to the consumer by the debt collector; and
