<br>"(iii) Termination if adverse determination.—If the Attorney General renders an adverse determination with respect to subparagraph (A)(i), and the eligible alien's rebuttal does not cause the Attorney General to reverse such determination, the Attorney General shall so notify the alien involved and, subject to subsection (d), shall terminate the permanent resident status of the alien (and that of the alien's spouse and children if it was obtained on a conditional basis under section 216A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1186b)).
<br>
<br>"(iv) Administrative and judicial review.—An alien may seek administrative review of an adverse determination made under subparagraph (A) by filing a petition for such review with the Board of Immigration Appeals. If the Board of Immigration Appeals denies the petition, the alien may seek judicial review. The procedures for judicial review under this clause shall be the same as the procedures for judicial review of a final order of removal under section 242(a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1252(a)(1)). During the period in which an administrative or judicial appeal under this clause is pending, the Attorney General shall continue the conditional basis of the alien's permanent resident status (and that of the alien's spouse and children if it was obtained under section 216A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1186b)).

<br>
<br>"(C) Period for filing petition.—
<br>
<br>"(i) 90-day period before second anniversary.—Except as provided in clause (ii), the petition under subparagraph (B) must be filed during the 90-day period before the second anniversary of the continuation, under paragraph (1)(F)(ii), of the conditional basis of the alien's lawful admission for permanent residence.
<br>

<br>(11) Eligibility determination under the electronic system for travel authorization
<br>
<br>Beginning on the date on which the electronic system for travel authorization developed under subsection (h)(3) is fully operational, each alien traveling under the program shall, before applying for admission to the United States, electronically provide to the system biographical information and such other information as the Secretary of Homeland Security shall determine necessary to determine the eligibility of, and whether there exists a law enforcement or security risk in permitting, the alien to travel to the United States.
