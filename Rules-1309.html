<br>(A) creates or eliminates any Federal or State criminal jurisdiction over Indian country; or
<br>
<br>(B) affects the authority of the United States or any State government that has been delegated authority by the United States to investigate and prosecute a criminal violation in Indian country.
<br>(4) Exceptions
<br>(A) Victim and defendant are both non-Indians
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>A participating tribe may not exercise special domestic violence criminal jurisdiction over an alleged offense if neither the defendant nor the alleged victim is an Indian.
<br>(ii) Definition of victim
<br>
<br>In this subparagraph and with respect to a criminal proceeding in which a participating tribe exercises special domestic violence criminal jurisdiction based on a violation of a protection order, the term "victim" means a person specifically protected by a protection order that the defendant allegedly violated.
<br>(B) Defendant lacks ties to the Indian tribe
<br>
<br>A participating tribe may exercise special domestic violence criminal jurisdiction over a defendant only if the defendant—
<br>
<br>(i) resides in the Indian country of the participating tribe;

<br>(ii) is employed in the Indian country of the participating tribe; or
<br>
<br>(iii) is a spouse, intimate partner, or dating partner of—

<br>
<br>(II) an Indian who resides in the Indian country of the participating tribe.

<br>
<br>A participating tribe may exercise special domestic violence criminal jurisdiction over a defendant for criminal conduct that falls into one or more of the following categories:

<br>(2) Violations of protection orders
<br>
<br>An act that—
<br>
<br>(A) occurs in the Indian country of the participating tribe; and
<br>
<br>(B) violates the portion of a protection order that—
<br>
<br>(i) prohibits or provides protection against violent or threatening acts or harassment against, sexual violence against, contact or communication with, or physical proximity to, another person;
<br>
<br>(ii) was issued against the defendant;
<br>
<br>(iii) is enforceable by the participating tribe; and
<br>
<br>(iv) is consistent with section 2265(b) of title 18.
<br>(d) Rights of defendants
<br>
<br>In a criminal proceeding in which a participating tribe exercises special domestic violence criminal jurisdiction, the participating tribe shall provide to the defendant—
<br>
<br>(1) all applicable rights under this Act;
<br>
<br>(2) if a term of imprisonment of any length may be imposed, all rights described in section 1302(c) of this title;
<br>
<br>(3) the right to a trial by an impartial jury that is drawn from sources that—
<br>
<br>(A) reflect a fair cross section of the community; and
<br>
<br>(B) do not systematically exclude any distinctive group in the community, including non-Indians; and
<br>
<br>(4) all other rights whose protection is necessary under the Constitution of the United States in order for Congress to recognize and affirm the inherent power of the participating tribe to exercise special domestic violence criminal jurisdiction over the defendant.
<br>(e) Petitions to stay detention
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>A person who has filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in a court of the United States under section 1303 of this title may petition that court to stay further detention of that person by the participating tribe.
<br>(2) Grant of stay
<br>
<br>A court shall grant a stay described in paragraph (1) if the court—
<br>
<br>(A) finds that there is a substantial likelihood that the habeas corpus petition will be granted; and
<br>
<br>(B) after giving each alleged victim in the matter an opportunity to be heard, finds by clear and convincing evidence that under conditions imposed by the court, the petitioner is not likely to flee or pose a danger to any person or the community if released.
<br>(3) Notice
<br>
<br>An Indian tribe that has ordered the detention of any person has a duty to timely notify such person of his rights and privileges under this subsection and under section 1303 of this title.
<br>(f) Grants to tribal governments
<br>
<br>The Attorney General may award grants to the governments of Indian tribes (or to authorized designees of those governments)—
<br>

<br>(3) to ensure that, in criminal proceedings in which a participating tribe exercises special domestic violence criminal jurisdiction, jurors are summoned, selected, and instructed in a manner consistent with all applicable requirements; and
<br>
<br>(4) to accord victims of domestic violence, dating violence, and violations of protection orders rights that are similar to the rights of a crime victim described in section 3771(a) of title 18, consistent with tribal law and custom.

<br>§1403. Preparation of plan
<br>(a) Prerequisites for final preparation
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall prepare a plan which shall best serve the interests of all those entities and individuals entitled to receive funds of each Indian judgment. Prior to the final preparation of the plan, the Secretary shall—
<br>
<br>(1) receive and consider any resolution or communication, together with any suggested use or distribution plan, which any affected Indian tribe may wish to submit to him; and
<br>
<br>(2) hold a hearing of record, after appropriate public notice, to obtain the testimony of leaders and members of the Indian tribe which may receive any portion, or be affected by the use or distribution, of such funds, in the area in which such Indian tribe is located and at a time which shall best serve the convenience of the eligible members thereof.
<br>(b) Guidelines
<br>
<br>In preparing a plan for the use or distribution of the funds of each Indian judgment, the Secretary shall, among other things, be assured that—
<br>
<br>(1) legal, financial, and other expertise of the Department of the Interior has been made fully available in an advisory capacity to the Indian tribe which is entitled to such funds to assist it to develop and communicate to the Secretary pursuant to clause (1) of subsection (a) of this section its own suggested plan for the distribution and use of such funds;
<br>
<br>(2) the needs and desires of any groups or individuals who are in a minority position, but who are also entitled to receive such funds, have been fully ascertained and considered;
<br>
<br>(3) the interests of minors and other legally incompetent persons who are entitled to receive any portion of such funds as are subsequently distributed to them are and will be protected and preserved; 1 Provided, That such funds may be disbursed to the parents or legal guardian of such minors or legal incompetents in such amounts as may be necessary for the minor or legal incompetent's health, education, welfare, or emergencies under a plan or plans approved by the Secretary and the tribal governing body of the Indian tribe involved.2
<br>
<br>(4) any provision, including enrollment provisions, of the constitution, bylaws, rules, and procedures of such tribe which may affect the distribution or other use of such funds are in full accord with the principles of fairness and equity;
<br>
<br>(5) a significant portion of such funds shall be set aside and programed to serve common tribal needs, educational requirements, and such other purposes as the circumstances of the affected Indian tribe may justify, except not less than 20 per centum of such funds shall be so set aside and programed unless the Secretary determines that the particular circumstances of the pertinent Indian tribe clearly warrant otherwise: Provided, That in the development of such plan the Secretary shall survey past and present plans of the tribe for economic development, shall consider long range benefits which might accrue to the tribe from such plans, and shall encourage programing of funds for economic development purposes where appropriate; and
<br>
<br>(6) methods exist and will be employed to insure the proper performance of the plan once it becomes effective under section 1405 of this title.

<br>In order to provide credit that is not available from private money markets, or to supplement funds from private lenders, including loans guaranteed by the Secretary pursuant to section 1481 of this title, all funds that are now or hereafter a part of the revolving fund authorized by the Act of June 18, 1934 (48 Stat. 986) [25 U.S.C. 5101 et seq.], the Act of June 26, 1936 (49 Stat. 1968),1 and the Act of April 19, 1950 (64 Stat. 44), as amended and supplemented, including sums received in settlement of debts of livestock pursuant to sections 1545 and 1546 of this title, and sums collected in repayment of loans heretofore or hereafter made, and as interest or other charges on loans, shall hereafter be administered as a single Indian Revolving Loan Fund. The fund shall be available for loans to Indians having a form of organization that is satisfactory to the Secretary and for loans to individual Indians: Provided, That, where the Secretary determines a rejection of a loan application from a member of an organization making loans to its membership from moneys borrowed from the fund is unwarranted, he may, in his discretion, make a direct loan to such individual from the fund.

<br>Findings and Purpose
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 107–331, title I, §102, Dec. 13, 2002, 116 Stat. 2835, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(a) Findings.—Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>"(1) the Indian Financing Act of 1974 (25 U.S.C. 1451 et seq.) was intended to provide Native American borrowers with access to commercial sources of capital that otherwise would not be available through the guarantee or insurance of loans by the Secretary of the Interior;
<br>
<br>"(2) although the Secretary of the Interior has made loan guarantees and insurance available, use of those guarantees and that insurance by lenders to benefit Native American business borrowers has been limited;
<br>
<br>"(3) twenty-seven years after the date of enactment of the Indian Financing Act of 1974 (25 U.S.C. 1451 et seq.) [Pub. L. 93–262, which was approved Apr. 12, 1974], the promotion and development of Native American-owned business remains an essential foundation for growth of economic and social stability of Native Americans;
<br>
<br>"(4) use by commercial lenders of the available loan insurance and guarantees may be limited by liquidity and other capital market-driven concerns; and
<br>
<br>"(5) it is in the best interest of the insured and guaranteed loan program of the Department of the Interior—
<br>
<br>"(A) to encourage the orderly development and expansion of a secondary market for loans guaranteed or insured by the Secretary of the Interior; and
<br>
<br>"(B) to expand the number of lenders originating loans under the Indian Financing Act of 1974 (25 U.S.C. 1451 et seq.).
<br>
<br>"(b) Purpose.—The purpose of this Act [see Short Title of 2002 Amendment note set out under section 1451 of this title] is to reform and clarify the Indian Financing Act of 1974 (25 U.S.C. 1451 et seq.) in order to—
<br>
<br>"(1) stimulate the use by lenders of secondary market investors for loans guaranteed or insured under a program administered by the Secretary of the Interior;
<br>
<br>"(2) preserve the authority of the Secretary to administer the program and regulate lenders;
<br>
<br>"(3) clarify that a good faith investor in loans insured or guaranteed by the Secretary will receive appropriate payments;
<br>
<br>"(4) provide for the appointment by the Secretary of a qualified fiscal transfer agent to establish and administer a system for the orderly transfer of those loans; and
<br>
<br>"(5)(A) authorize the Secretary to promulgate regulations to encourage and expand a secondary market program for loans guaranteed or insured by the Secretary; and
<br>
<br>"(B) allow the pooling of those loans as the secondary market develops."
