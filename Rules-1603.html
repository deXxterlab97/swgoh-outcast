In so doing, the Administrator shall ensure that such education programs have measurable objectives and milestones as well as clear, documented metrics for evaluating programs. For each such education program or portfolio of similar programs, the Administrator shall—
<br>
<br>(1) encourage the collection of evidence as relevant to the measurable objectives and milestones; and
<br>
<br>(2) ensure that program or portfolio evaluations focus on educational outcomes and not just inputs, activities completed, or the number of participants.
