<br>Congressional Statement of Findings and Purpose
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 91–452, §1, Oct. 15, 1970, 84 Stat. 922, provided in part that:
<br>
<br>"The Congress finds that (1) organized crime in the United States is a highly sophisticated, diversified, and widespread activity that annually drains billions of dollars from America's economy by unlawful conduct and the illegal use of force, fraud, and corruption; (2) organized crime derives a major portion of its power through money obtained from such illegal endeavors as syndicated gambling, loan sharking, the theft and fencing of property, the importation and distribution of narcotics and other dangerous drugs, and other forms of social exploitation; (3) this money and power are increasingly used to infiltrate and corrupt legitimate business and labor unions and to subvert and corrupt our democratic processes; (4) organized crime activities in the United States weaken the stability of the Nation's economic system, harm innocent investors and competing organizations, interfere with free competition, seriously burden interstate and foreign commerce, threaten the domestic security, and undermine the general welfare of the Nation and its citizens; and (5) organized crime continues to grow because of defects in the evidence-gathering process of the law inhibiting the development of the legally admissible evidence necessary to bring criminal and other sanctions or remedies to bear on the unlawful activities of those engaged in organized crime and because the sanctions and remedies available to the Government are unnecessarily limited in scope and impact.
<br>
<br>"It is the purpose of this Act [see Short Title of 1970 Amendment note above] to seek the eradication of organized crime in the United States by strengthening the legal tools in the evidence-gathering process, by establishing new penal prohibitions, and by providing enhanced sanctions and new remedies to deal with the unlawful activities of those engaged in organized crime."
<br>Liberal Construction of Provisions; Supersedure of Federal or State Laws; Authority of Attorneys Representing United States
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 91–452, title IX, §904, Oct. 15, 1970, 84 Stat. 947, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(a) The provisions of this title [enacting this chapter and amending sections 1505, 2516, and 2517 of this title] shall be liberally construed to effectuate its remedial purposes.
<br>
<br>"(b) Nothing in this title shall supersede any provision of Federal, State, or other law imposing criminal penalties or affording civil remedies in addition to those provided for in this title.
<br>
<br>"(c) Nothing contained in this title shall impair the authority of any attorney representing the United States to—
<br>
<br>"(1) lay before any grand jury impaneled by any district court of the United States any evidence concerning any alleged racketeering violation of law;
<br>
<br>"(2) invoke the power of any such court to compel the production of any evidence before any such grand jury; or
<br>
<br>"(3) institute any proceeding to enforce any order or process issued in execution of such power or to punish disobedience of any such order or process by any person."
