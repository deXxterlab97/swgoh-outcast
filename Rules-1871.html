<br>
<br>(A) the eligible veteran—
<br>
<br>(i) to identify the personal care services required by the eligible veteran; and

<br>

<br>
<br>(d)(1) Notwithstanding the attributable income of a veteran, the Secretary may refuse to make a determination described in paragraph (2) of this subsection if the corpus of the estate of the veteran is such that under all the circumstances it is reasonable that some part of the corpus of the estate of the veteran be consumed for the veteran's maintenance.

<br>
<br>(f) For purposes of this section:
<br>
<br>(1) The term "attributable income" means the income of a veteran for the most recent year for which information is available determined in the same manner as the manner in which a determination is made of the total amount of income by which the rate of pension for such veteran under section 1521 of this title would be reduced if such veteran were eligible for pension under that section.
<br>
<br>(2) The term "corpus of the estate of the veteran" includes the corpus of the estates of the veteran's spouse and dependent children, if any.
<br>
<br>(3) The term "previous year" means the calendar year preceding the year in which the veteran applies for care or services under section 1710(a) of this title.
<br>

<br>
<br>(1) eligible to receive medical assistance under a State plan approved under title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.);
<br>
<br>(2) a veteran with a service-connected disability; or
