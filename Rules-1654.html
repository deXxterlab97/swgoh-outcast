<br>Editorial Notes

<br>
<br>Part F, referred to in subsec. (a)(3), is part F of title I of Pub. L. 90–351, which was classified to subchapter VI (§§3769 to 3769d) of chapter 46 of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare, prior to repeal by Pub. L. 109–162, title XI, §1154(a), Jan. 5, 2006, 119 Stat. 3113.
<br>
<br>Part V, referred to in subsec. (a)(3), (20), is former part V of title I of Pub. L. 90–351, which was classified to former subchapter XII–J (§§3796ii to 3796ii–8) of chapter 46 of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare, prior to repeal by Pub. L. 104–134, title I, §101[(a)] [title I, §114(b)(1)(A)], Apr. 26, 1996, 110 Stat. 1321, 1321–21; renumbered title I, Pub. L. 104–140, §1(a), May 2, 1996, 110 Stat. 1327. Subsequently, a new Part V was enacted by Pub. L. 106–515, §3(a), Nov. 13, 2000, 114 Stat. 2399, and is classified to subchapter XXI of this chapter.
<br>
<br>Section 2401(c) of title II of Division B of the 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act, referred to in subsec. (a)(25)(C), probably means section 2301(c) of title II of div. B of Pub. L. 107–273, Nov. 2, 2002, 116 Stat. 1798, which is not classified to the Code. Pub. L. 107–273 does not contain a section 2401.
<br>
<br>Section 10741(a)(4) of subchapter XL, referred to in subsec. (a)(28), was in the original "section 3031(a)(4) of part NN", and was translated as meaning section 3041(a)(4) of part NN of title I of Pub. L. 90–351, to reflect the probable intent of Congress. Part NN only comprises section 3041.

<br>SUBCHAPTER XI—PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS' DEATH BENEFITS
<br>Part A—Death Benefits
<br>§10281. Payment of death benefits
<br>(a) Amount; recipients
<br>
<br>In any case in which the Bureau of Justice Assistance (hereinafter in this subchapter referred to as the "Bureau") determines, under regulations issued pursuant to this subchapter, that a public safety officer has died as the direct and proximate result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty, the Bureau shall pay a benefit of $250,000, adjusted in accordance with subsection (h), as follows (if the payee indicated is living on the date on which the determination is made)—
<br>
<br>(1) if there is no child who survived the public safety officer, to the surviving spouse of the public safety officer;
<br>
<br>(2) if there is at least 1 child who survived the public safety officer and a surviving spouse of the public safety officer, 50 percent to the surviving child (or children, in equal shares) and 50 percent to the surviving spouse;
<br>
<br>(3) if there is no surviving spouse of the public safety officer, to the surviving child (or children, in equal shares);
<br>
<br>(4) if there is no surviving spouse of the public safety officer and no surviving child—
<br>
<br>(A) to the surviving individual (or individuals, in shares per the designation, or, otherwise, in equal shares) designated by the public safety officer to receive benefits under this subsection in the most recently executed designation of beneficiary of the public safety officer on file at the time of death with the public safety agency, organization, or unit; or
<br>
<br>(B) if there is no individual qualifying under subparagraph (A), to the surviving individual (or individuals, in equal shares) designated by the public safety officer to receive benefits under the most recently executed life insurance policy of the public safety officer on file at the time of death with the public safety agency, organization, or unit;
<br>
<br>(5) if there is no individual qualifying under paragraph (1), (2), (3), or (4), to the surviving parent (or parents, in equal shares) of the public safety officer; or
<br>
<br>(6) if there is no individual qualifying under paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), or (5), to the surviving individual (or individuals, in equal shares) who would qualify under the definition of the term "child" under section 10284 of this title but for age.
<br>(b) Benefits for permanent and total disability
<br>
<br>In accordance with regulations issued pursuant to this subchapter, in any case in which the Bureau determines that a public safety officer has become permanently and totally disabled as the direct and proximate result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty, the Bureau shall pay the same benefit to the public safety officer (if living on the date on which the determination is made) that is payable under subsection (a) with respect to the date on which the catastrophic injury occurred, as adjusted in accordance with subsection (h): Provided, That for the purposes of making these benefit payments, there are authorized to be appropriated for each fiscal year such sums as may be necessary: Provided further, That the amount payable under this subsection shall be the amount payable as of the date of catastrophic injury of such public safety officer.
<br>(c) Interim benefit payment
<br>
<br>Whenever the Bureau determines upon showing of need and prior to final action that the death of a public safety officer is one with respect to which a benefit will probably be paid, the Bureau may make an interim benefit payment not exceeding $3,000 to the individual entitled to receive a benefit under subsection (a) of this section.
<br>(d) Deduction of interim payment
<br>
<br>The amount of an interim payment under subsection (c) shall be deducted from the amount of any final benefit paid to such individual.
<br>(e) Repayment of interim payment; waiver
<br>
<br>Where there is no final benefit paid, the recipient of any interim payment under subsection (c) shall be liable for repayment of such amount. The Bureau may waive all or part of such repayment, considering for this purpose the hardship which would result from such repayment.
