<br>(a) Policies, procedures and recommendations
<br>
<br>Further to promote achievement of full employment under this chapter and the Employment Act of 1946 [15 U.S.C. 1021 et seq.], the President, through the Secretary of Labor, shall develop policies and procedures and, as necessary, recommend programs for providing employment opportunities to individuals aged 16 and over in the civilian labor force who are able, willing, and seeking to work but who, despite serious efforts to obtain employment, remain unemployed.
<br>(b) Utilization of authority under other laws
<br>
<br>In meeting the responsibilities under subsection (a), the Secretary of Labor shall, as appropriate, fully utilize the authority provided under title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act [29 U.S.C. 3111 et seq.] and other relevant provisions of law to—
<br>
<br>(1) assure the availability of counseling, training, and other support activities necessary to prepare persons willing and seeking work for employment;
<br>
<br>(2) refer persons able, willing, and seeking to work to job opportunities in the private and public sectors through the existing public employment placement facilities and through the United States Employment Service of the Department of Labor, including job opportunities in any positions created under programs established pursuant to sections 3112, 3114, and 3115 of this title; and
<br>
<br>(3) encourage flexi-time and part-time jobs for persons who are able, willing, and seeking employment but who are unable to work a standard workweek.
<br>(c) Establishment of project reservoirs; restrictions and requirements of new programs
<br>
<br>(1) To the extent that individuals aged sixteen and over and able, willing, and seeking to work are not and in the judgment of the President cannot be provided with private job opportunities or job opportunities under other programs and actions in existence, in accord with the goals and timetables set forth in the Employment Act of 1946 [15 U.S.C. 1021 et seq.], the President shall, as may be authorized by law, establish reservoirs of public employment and private nonprofit employment projects, to be approved by the Secretary of Labor, through expansion of activities under title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act [29 U.S.C. 3111 et seq.] and other existing employment and training projects or through such new programs as are determined necessary by the President or through both such projects and such programs.
<br>
<br>(2) New programs as may be authorized by law after October 27, 1978, referred to in paragraph (c)(1)—
<br>
<br>(A) shall not be put into operation earlier than two years after October 27, 1978, nor without a finding by the President, transmitted to the Congress, that other means of employment are not yielding enough jobs to be consistent with attainment of the goals and timetables for the reduction of unemployment set forth in the Employment Act of 1946 [15 U.S.C. 1021 et seq.];
<br>
<br>(B) shall be designed so that no workers from private employment are drawn into the reservoir projects thereunder;
<br>
<br>(C) shall be useful and productive jobs;
<br>
<br>(D) shall be mainly in the lower ranges of skills and pay, and toward this end the number of reservoir jobs under such new programs shall, to the extent practicable, be maximized in relationship to the appropriations provided for such jobs;
<br>
<br>(E) shall be targeted on areas of high unemployment and on individuals who are structurally unemployed;
<br>
<br>(F) shall be phased in by the President as necessary, in conjunction with the employment goals under sections 3(a)(2) and 4(b) of the Employment Act of 1946 [15 U.S.C. 1022(a)(2), 1022a(b)].
<br>(d) Regulations
<br>
<br>The Secretary, in carrying out the provisions of this section, shall establish regulations providing for—
<br>
<br>(1) an initial determination of the job seeker's ability to be employed at certain types and duration of work, so that such individual may be appropriately referred to jobs, training, counseling, and other supportive services;
<br>
<br>(2) compliance with the nondiscrimination provisions of this chapter in accordance with section 3151 of this title;
<br>
<br>(3) appropriate eligibility criteria to determine the order of priority of access of any person to any new programs under subsection (c) as may be authorized by law including but not necessarily limited to (A) household income, duration of unemployment (not less than five weeks), and the number of people economically dependent upon such person; and (B) denial of access to any person refusing to accept or hold a job except for good cause, as determined by the Secretary of Labor, including refusal to accept or hold a job subject to reference under subsection (b) paragraph (2), in order to seek a reservoir project job under subsection (c); and

<br>§3117. Capital formation
<br>(a) Congressional findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) promotion of full employment and balanced growth is in itself a principal avenue to high and sustained rates of capital formation;
<br>
<br>(2) high rates of capital formation are necessary to ensure adequate rates of capacity expansion and productivity growth, compliance with governmental health, safety and environmental standards, and the replacement of obsolete production equipment;
<br>
<br>(3) the ability of our economy to compete successfully in international markets, the development of new technology, improved working conditions, expanding job opportunities, and an increasing standard of living depend on the availability of adequate capital at reasonable cost to commerce and industry;
<br>
<br>(4) an important goal of national policy shall be to remove obstacles to the free flow of resources into new investment, particularly those obstacles that hinder the creation and growth of smaller businesses because general national programs and policies to aid and stimulate private enterprise are not sufficient to deal with the special problems and needs of smaller businesses; and
<br>
<br>(5) while private business firms are, and should continue to be, the major source of investment, the investment activities of the Federal, State, and local governments play an important role in affecting the level of output, employment, and productivity and in achieving other national purposes.
<br>(b) Investment Policy Report; recommendations in President's Budget; referral to Joint Economic Committee
<br>
<br>The Economic Report shall include an Investment Policy Report which shall, as appropriate, (1) review and assess existing Federal Government programs and policies which affect business investment decisions, including, but not limited to, the relevant aspects of the tax code, Federal expenditure policy, Federal regulatory policy, international trade policy, and Federal support for research, development, and diffusion of new technologies; (2) provide an assessment of the levels of investment capital available, required by, and applied to small, medium and large business entities; (3) provide an analysis of current foreseeable trends in the level of investment capital available to such entities; and (4) provide a description of programs and proposals for carrying out the policy set forth in section 1021(i) of this title. In addition, the Economic Report shall include an assessment of the effect of the overall economic policy environment and the rate of inflation on business investment. The President shall recommend in the President's Budget, as appropriate, new programs or modifications to improve existing programs concerned with private capital formation. The President shall also transmit to the Congress as part of the President's Budget such other recommendations as the President may deem necessary or desirable to achieve the policy as set forth in section 1021(i) of this title. The Investment Policy Report, when transmitted to the Congress, shall be referred to the Joint Economic Committee.
<br>(c) Review in Economic Report of Federal policies and programs which affect public investments; recommendations respecting new policies or programs
<br>
<br>The Economic Report referred to in subsection (b) shall review and assess Federal policies and programs which directly, or through grants-in-aid to State and local governments, or indirectly through other means, affect the adequacy, composition and effectiveness of public investments, as a means of achieving the goals of this chapter and the Employment Act of 1946 [15 U.S.C. 1021 et seq.]. The President shall recommend, as appropriate, new programs and policies or modifications to improve existing Federal programs affecting public investment.

<br>Additional Definitions
<br>
<br>Except as otherwise specifically provided, the definitions in section 2602 of Title 16, Conservation, apply to this chapter.
<br>§3203. Adoption of certain standards
<br>(a) Adoption of standards
<br>
<br>Not later than 2 years after November 9, 1978 (or after October 24, 1992, in the case of standards under paragraphs (3),1 and (4) of subsection (b)), each State regulatory authority (with respect to each gas utility for which it has ratemaking authority) and each nonregulated gas utility shall provide public notice and conduct a hearing respecting the standards established by subsection (b), and, on the basis of such hearing, shall—
<br>
<br>(1) adopt the standard established by subsection (b)(1), if, and to the extent, such authority or nonregulated utility determines that such adoption is appropriate and is consistent with otherwise applicable State law, and
<br>
<br>(2) adopt the standards established by paragraphs (2), (3) 2 (4), (5), and (6) of subsection (b), if, and to the extent, such authority or nonregulated utility determines that such adoption is appropriate to carry out the purposes of this chapter, is otherwise appropriate, and is consistent with otherwise applicable State law.
<br>
<br>For purposes of any determination under paragraphs (1) and (2) and any review of such determination in any court under section 3207 of this title, the purposes of this chapter supplement State law. Nothing in this subsection prohibits any State regulatory authority or nonregulated utility from making any determination that it is not appropriate to implement any such standard, pursuant to its authority under otherwise applicable State law.
<br>(b) Establishment
<br>
<br>The following Federal standards are hereby established:
<br>(1) Procedures for termination of natural gas service
<br>
<br>No gas utility may terminate natural gas service to any gas consumer except pursuant to procedures described in section 3204(a) of this title.
<br>(2) Advertising
<br>
<br>No gas utility may recover from any person other than the shareholders (or other owners) of such utility any direct or indirect expenditure by such utility for promotional or political advertising as defined in section 3204(b) of this title.
<br>(3) Integrated resource planning
<br>
<br>Each gas utility shall employ, in order to provide adequate and reliable service to its gas customers at the lowest system cost. All plans or filings of a State regulated gas utility before a State regulatory authority to meet the requirements of this paragraph shall (A) be updated on a regular basis, (B) provide the opportunity for public participation and comment, (C) provide for methods of validating predicted performance, and (D) contain a requirement that the plan be implemented after approval of the State regulatory authority. Subsection (c) shall not apply to this paragraph to the extent that it could be construed to require the State regulatory authority to extend the record of a State proceeding in submitting reports to the Federal Government.
<br>(4) Investments in conservation and demand management
<br>
<br>The rates charged by any State regulated gas utility shall be such that the utility's prudent investments in, and expenditures for, energy conservation and load shifting programs and for other demand-side management measures which are consistent with the findings and purposes of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 are at least as profitable (taking into account the income lost due to reduced sales resulting from such programs) as prudent investments in, and expenditures for, the acquisition or construction of supplies and facilities. This objective requires that (A) regulators link the utility's net revenues, at least in part, to the utility's performance in implementing cost-effective programs promoted by this section; and (B) regulators ensure that, for purposes of recovering fixed costs, including its authorized return, the utility's performance is not affected by reductions in its retail sales volumes.
<br>(5) Energy efficiency
<br>
<br>Each natural gas utility shall—
<br>
<br>(A) integrate energy efficiency resources into the plans and planning processes of the natural gas utility; and
<br>
<br>(B) adopt policies that establish energy efficiency as a priority resource in the plans and planning processes of the natural gas utility.
<br>(6) Rate design modifications to promote energy efficiency investments
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The rates allowed to be charged by a natural gas utility shall align utility incentives with the deployment of cost-effective energy efficiency.
<br>(B) Policy options
<br>
<br>In complying with subparagraph (A), each State regulatory authority and each nonregulated utility shall consider—
<br>
<br>(i) separating fixed-cost revenue recovery from the volume of transportation or sales service provided to the customer;
<br>
<br>(ii) providing to utilities incentives for the successful management of energy efficiency programs, such as allowing utilities to retain a portion of the cost-reducing benefits accruing from the programs;
<br>
<br>(iii) promoting the impact on adoption of energy efficiency as 1 of the goals of retail rate design, recognizing that energy efficiency must be balanced with other objectives; and
<br>
<br>(iv) adopting rate designs that encourage energy efficiency for each customer class.
<br>
<br>For purposes of applying the provisions of this chapter 3 to this paragraph, any reference in this chapter 3 to November 9, 1978, shall be treated as a reference to December 19, 2007.
<br>(c) Procedural requirements
<br>
<br>Each State regulatory authority (with respect to each gas utility for which it has ratemaking authority) and each nonregulated gas utility, within the 2-year period specified in subsection (a), shall adopt, pursuant to subsection (a), each of the standards established by subsection (b), or, with respect to any such standard which is not adopted, such authority or nonregulated gas utility shall state in writing that it has determined not to adopt such standard, together with the reasons for such determination. Such statement of reasons shall be available to the public.
<br>(d) Small business impacts
<br>
<br>If a State regulatory authority implements a standard established by subsection (b)(3) or (4), such authority shall—
<br>
<br>(1) consider the impact that implementation of such standard would have on small businesses engaged in the design, sale, supply, installation, or servicing of energy conservation, energy efficiency, or other demand-side management measures, and
<br>
<br>(2) implement such standard so as to assure that utility actions would not provide such utilities with unfair competitive advantages over such small businesses.

<br>In order to assist in meeting natural gas requirements for high-priority uses of natural gas during any natural gas supply emergency declared under section 3361 of this title, the President may, by order, allocate supplies of natural gas under subsections (b), (c), and (d) to—
<br>
<br>(1) any interstate pipeline;
<br>
<br>(2) any local distribution company—
<br>
<br>(A) which is served by any interstate pipeline;
<br>
<br>(B) which is providing natural gas only for high-priority uses; and
<br>
<br>(C) which is in need of deliveries of natural gas to assist in meeting natural gas requirements for high-priority uses of natural gas; and
<br>
<br>(3) any person for meeting requirements of high-priority uses of natural gas.
<br>(b) Allocation of certain boiler fuel gas
<br>(1) Required finding
<br>
<br>The President shall not allocate supplies of natural gas under this subsection unless he finds that—
<br>
<br>(A) to the maximum extent practicable, emergency purchase authority under section 3362 of this title has been utilized to assist in meeting natural gas requirements for high-priority uses of natural gas;
<br>
<br>(B) emergency purchases of natural gas supplies under section 3362 of this title are not likely to satisfy the natural gas requirements for such high-priority uses;
<br>
<br>(C) the exercise of authority under this subsection is reasonably necessary to assist in meeting natural gas requirements for such high-priority uses; and
<br>
<br>(D) any interstate pipeline or local distribution company receiving such natural gas has ordered the termination of all deliveries of natural gas for other than high-priority uses and attempted to to 1 the maximum extent practicable to terminate such deliveries.
<br>(2) Allocation authority
<br>
<br>Subject to paragraph (1), in order to assist in meeting natural gas requirements for high-priority uses of natural gas, the President may, by order, allocate supplies of natural gas the use of which has been prohibited by the President pursuant to authority under section 717z of this title (relating to the use of natural gas as a boiler fuel during any natural gas supply emergency).
<br>(c) Allocation of general pipeline supply
<br>(1) Required findings
<br>
<br>The President shall not allocate supplies of natural gas under this subsection unless he finds that—
<br>
<br>(A) to the maximum extent practicable, allocation of supplies of natural gas under subsection (b) has been utilized to assist in meeting natural gas requirements for high-priority uses of natural gas;
<br>
<br>(B) the exercise of such authority is not likely to satisfy the natural gas requirements for such high-priority uses;
<br>
<br>(C) the exercise of authority under this subsection is reasonably necessary to assist in meeting natural gas requirements for such high-priority uses;
<br>
<br>(D) any interstate pipeline or local distribution company receiving such natural gas has ordered the termination of all deliveries of natural gas for other than high-priority uses and attempted to the maximum extent practicable to terminate such deliveries;
<br>
<br>(E) such allocation will not create, for the interstate pipeline delivering certificated natural gas, a supply shortage which will cause such pipeline to be unable to meet the natural gas requirements for high-priority uses of natural gas served, directly or indirectly, by such pipeline; and
<br>
<br>(F) such allocation will not result in a disproportionate share of deliveries and resulting curtailments of natural gas being experienced by such interstate pipeline when compared to deliveries and resulting curtailments which are experienced as a result of orders issued under this subsection applicable to other interstate pipelines (as determined by the President).
<br>(2) Required notification from State
<br>(A) 2 Notification
<br>
<br>The President shall not allocate supplies of natural gas under this subsection unless he is notified by the Governor of any State that—
<br>
<br>(i) a shortage of natural gas supplies available to such State exists or is imminent;
<br>
<br>(ii) such shortage or imminent shortage endangers the supply of natural gas for high-priority uses in such State; and
<br>
<br>(iii) the exercise of authority under State law is inadequate to protect high-priority uses of natural gas in such State from an interruption in natural gas supplies.
<br>(3) Basis of finding
<br>
<br>To the maximum extent practicable, the Governor shall submit, together with any notification under subparagraph (A), information upon which he has based his finding under such subparagraph, including—
<br>
<br>(i) volumes of natural gas required to meet the natural gas requirements for high-priority uses of natural gas in such State;
<br>
<br>(ii) information received from persons in the business of producing, selling, transporting, or delivering natural gas in such State as to the volumes of natural gas supplies available to such State;
<br>
<br>(iii) information on the authority under State law which will be exercised to protect high-priority uses; and
<br>
<br>(iv) such other information which the President requests or which the Governor determines appropriate to apprise the President of emergency deliveries and transportation of interstate natural gas needed by such State.
<br>(4) Allocation authority
<br>
<br>Subject to paragraphs (1), (2), and (5), in order to assist in meeting natural gas requirements for high-priority uses of natural gas, the President may, by order, allocate supplies of certificated natural gas from any interstate pipeline.
<br>(5) Consideration of alternative fuel availability
<br>
<br>In issuing any order under this subsection the President shall consider the relative availability of alternative fuel to natural gas users supplied by the interstate pipeline ordered to make deliveries pursuant to this subsection.
<br>(d) Allocation of user-owned gas
