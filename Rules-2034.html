<br>
<br>The Alaska Statehood Act, as amended, referred to in subsec. (a)(1), (2), is Pub. L. 85–508, July 7, 1958, 72 Stat. 339, as amended, which is set out as a note preceding section 21 of Title 48, Territories and Insular Possessions. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Tables.
<br>§1611. Native land selections
<br>(a) Acreage limitation; proximity of selections and size of sections and units; waiver
<br>
<br>(1) During a period of three years from December 18, 1971, the Village Corporation for each Native village identified pursuant to section 1610 of this title shall select, in accordance with rules established by the Secretary, all of the township or townships in which any part of the village is located, plus an area that will make the total selection equal to the acreage to which the village is entitled under section 1613 of this title. The selection shall be made from lands withdrawn by section 1610(a) of this title: Provided, That no Village Corporation may select more than 69,120 acres from lands withdrawn by section 1610(a)(2) of this title, and not more than 69,120 acres from the National Wildlife Refuge System, and not more than 69,120 acres in a National Forest: Provided further, That when a Village Corporation selects the surface estate to lands within the National Wildlife Refuge System or Naval Petroleum Reserve Numbered 4, the Regional Corporation, for that region may select the subsurface estate in an equal acreage from other lands withdrawn in section 1610(a) of this title within the region, if possible.
<br>
<br>(2) Selections made under this subsection (a) shall be contiguous and in reasonably compact tracts, except as separated by bodies of water or by lands which are unavailable for selection, and shall be in whole sections and, wherever feasible, in units of not less than 1,280 acres: Provided, That the Secretary in his discretion and upon the request of the concerned Village Corporation, may waive the whole section requirement where—
<br>
<br>(A)(i) a portion of available public lands of a section is separated from other available public lands in the same section by lands unavailable for selection or by a meanderable body of water;
<br>
<br>(ii) such waiver will not result in small isolated parcels of available public land remaining after conveyance of selected lands to Native Corporations; and
<br>
<br>(iii) such waiver would result in a better land ownership pattern or improved land or resource management opportunity; or
<br>
<br>(B) the remaining available public lands in the section have been selected and will be conveyed to another Native Corporation under this chapter.
<br>(b) Allocation; reallocation considerations
<br>
<br>The difference between twenty-two million acres and the total acreage selected by Village Corporations pursuant to subsection (a) shall be allocated by the Secretary among the eleven Regional Corporations (which excludes the Regional Corporation for southeastern Alaska) on the basis of the number of Natives enrolled in each region. Each Regional Corporation shall, not later than October 1, 2005, reallocate such acreage among the Native villages within the region on an equitable basis after considering historic use, subsistence needs, and population. The action of the Secretary or the Corporation shall not be subject to judicial review. Each Village Corporation shall select the acreage allocated to it from the lands withdrawn by section 1610(a) of this title.
<br>(c) Computation
<br>
<br>The difference between thirty-eight million acres and the 22 million acres selected by Village Corporations pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) shall be allocated among the eleven Regional Corporations (which excludes the Regional Corporation for southeastern Alaska) as follows:
<br>
<br>(1) The number of acres each Regional Corporation is entitled to receive shall be computed (A) by determining on the basis of available data the percentages of all land in Alaska (excluding the southeastern region) that is within each of the eleven regions, (B) by applying that percentage to thirty-eight million acres reduced by the acreage in the southeastern region that is to be selected pursuant to section 1615 of this title, and (C) by deducting from the figure so computed the number of acres within that region selected pursuant to subsections (a) and (b).
<br>
<br>(2) In the event that the total number of acres selected within a region pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) exceeds the percentage of the reduced thirty-eight million acres allotted to that region pursuant to subsection (c)(1)(B), that region shall not be entitled to receive any lands under this subsection (c). For each region so affected the difference between the acreage calculated pursuant to subsection (c)(1)(B) and the acreage selected pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) shall be deducted from the acreage calculated under subsection (c)(1)(C) for the remaining regions which will select lands under this subsection (c). The reductions shall be apportioned among the remaining regions so that each region's share of the total reduction bears the same proportion to the total reduction as the total land area in that region (as calculated pursuant to subsection (c)(1)(A) 1 bears to the total land area in all of the regions whose allotments are to be reduced pursuant to this paragraph.
<br>
<br>(3) Before the end of the fourth year after December 18, 1971, each Regional Corporation shall select the acreage allocated to it from the lands within the region withdrawn pursuant to section 1610(a)(1) of this title, and from the lands within the region withdrawn pursuant to section 1610(a)(3) of this title to the extent lands withdrawn pursuant to section 1610(a)(1) of this title are not sufficient to satisfy its allocation: Provided, That within the lands withdrawn by section 1610(a)(1) of this title the Regional Corporation may select only even numbered townships in even numbered ranges, and only odd numbered townships in odd numbered ranges.
<br>
<br>(4) Where the public lands consist only of the mineral estate, or portion thereof, which is reserved by the United States upon patent of the balance of the estate under one of the public land laws, other than this chapter, the Regional Corporations may select as follows:
<br>
<br>(A) Where such public lands were not withdrawn pursuant to section 1610(a)(3) of this title, but are surrounded by or contiguous to lands withdrawn pursuant to section 1610(a)(3) of this title, and filed upon for selection by a Regional Corporation, the Corporation may, upon request, have such public land included in its selection and considered by the Secretary to be withdrawn and properly selected.
<br>
<br>(B) Where such public lands were withdrawn pursuant to section 1610(a)(1) of this title and are required to be selected by paragraph (3) of this subsection, the Regional Corporation may, at its option, exclude such public lands from its selection.
<br>
<br>(C) Where such public lands are surrounded by or contiguous to subsurface lands obtained by a Regional Corporation under subsections 2 (a) or (b), the Corporation may, upon request, have such public land conveyed to it.
<br>
<br>(D)(i) A Regional Corporation which elects to obtain public lands under subparagraph (C) shall be limited to a total of not more than 12,000 acres. Selection by a Regional Corporation of in lieu surface acres under subparagraph (E) pursuant to an election under subparagraph (C) shall not be made from any lands within a conservation system unit (as that term is defined by section 3102(4) of title 16).
<br>
<br>(ii) An election to obtain the public lands described in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) shall include all available parcels within the township in which the public lands are located.
<br>
<br>(iii) For purposes of this subparagraph and subparagraph (C), the term "Regional Corporation" shall refer only to Doyon, Limited.
<br>
<br>(E) Where the Regional Corporation elects to obtain such public lands under subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of this paragraph, it may select, within ninety days of receipt of notice from the Secretary, the surface estate in an equal acreage from other public lands withdrawn by the Secretary for that purpose. Such selections shall be in units no smaller than a whole section, except where the remaining entitlement is less than six hundred and forty acres, or where an entire section is not available. Where possible, selections shall be of lands from which the subsurface estate was selected by that Regional Corporation pursuant to subsection (a)(1) or section 1613(h)(9) of this title, and, where possible, all selections made under this section shall be contiguous to lands already selected by the Regional Corporation or a Village Corporation. The Secretary is authorized, as necessary, to withdraw up to two times the acreage entitlement of the in lieu surface estate from vacant, unappropriated, and unreserved public lands from which the Regional Corporation may select such in lieu surface estate except that the Secretary may withdraw public lands which had been previously withdrawn pursuant to subsection 1616(d)(1) of this title.
<br>
<br>(F) No mineral estate or in lieu surface estate shall be available for selection within the National Petroleum Reserve—Alaska or within Wildlife Refuges as the boundaries of those refuges exist on December 18, 1971.
<br>
<br>(5) Subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of paragraph (4) shall apply, notwithstanding the failure of the Regional Corporation to have appealed the rejection of a selection during the conveyance of the relevant surface estate.
<br>(d) Village Corporation for Native village at Dutch Harbor; lands and improvements and patent for Village Corporation
<br>
<br>To insure that the Village Corporation for the Native village at Dutch Harbor, if found eligible for land grants under this chapter, has a full opportunity to select lands within and near the village, no federally owned lands, whether improved or not, shall be disposed of pursuant to the Federal surplus property disposal laws for a period of two years from December 18, 1971. The Village Corporation may select such lands and improvements and receive patent to them pursuant to section 1613(a) of this title.
<br>(e) Disputes over land selection rights and boundaries; arbitration
<br>
<br>Any dispute over the land selection rights and the boundaries of Village Corporations shall be resolved by a board of arbitrators consisting of one person selected by each of the Village Corporations involved, and an additional one or two persons, whichever is needed to make an odd number of arbitrators, such additional person or persons to be selected by the arbitrators selected by the Village Corporations.
<br>(f) Combining entitlements and reallocations
<br>
<br>(1) The entitlements received by any Village Corporation under subsection (a) and the reallocations made to the Village Corporation under subsection (b) may be combined, at the discretion of the Secretary, without—
<br>
<br>(A) increasing or decreasing the combined entitlement; or
<br>
<br>(B) increasing the limitation on selections of Wildlife Refuge System land, National Forest System land, or State-selected land under subsection (a).
<br>
<br>(2) The combined entitlement under paragraph (1) may be fulfilled from selections under subsection (a) or (b) without regard to the entitlement specified in the selection application.
<br>
<br>(3) All selections under a combined entitlement under paragraph (1) shall be adjudicated and conveyed in compliance with this chapter.
<br>
<br>(4) Except in a case in which a survey has been contracted for December 10, 2004, the combination of entitlements under paragraph (1) shall not require separate patents or surveys, to distinguish between conveyances made to a Village Corporation under subsections (a) and (b).

The provisions of this section shall take effect at such time as all of the following have taken place:
<br>
<br>"(1) the State of Alaska has conveyed or irrevocably obligated itself to convey lands to the United States for exchange, hereby authorized, with the Region in accordance with the document referred to in subsection (b);
<br>
<br>"(2) the Region and all plaintiffs/appellants have withdrawn from Cook Inlet against Kleppe, numbered 75–2232, ninth circuit, and such proceedings have been dismissed with prejudice; and

<br>"(6) title to lands selected by the Region from a pool which shall be established by the Secretary and the Administrator of General Services: Provided, That conveyances pursuant to this paragraph shall not be subject to the provisions of section 22(l) of the Settlement Act [section 1621(l) of this title]: Provided further, That conveyances pursuant to this paragraph shall be made in exchange for lands or rights to select lands outside the boundaries of Cook Inlet Region as described in paragraph (5) of this subsection and on the basis of values determined by agreement among the parties, notwithstanding any other provision of law. Effective upon their conveyance, the lands referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection are excluded from the Kenai National Moose Range, but they shall automatically become part of the range and subject to the laws and regulations applicable thereto upon title thereafter vesting in the United States. The Secretary is authorized to acquire lands formerly within the range with the concurrence of the Region so long as the Region owns such lands.

<br>
<br>"(7)(i) Until the obligations of the Secretary and the Administrator of General Services under section 12(b)(5) and (6) of this Act [subsec. (b)(5), (6) of this note] are otherwise fulfilled: (a) Cook Inlet Region, Incorporated, may, by using the account established in subsection 12(b)(7)(iv) [subsec. (b)(7)(iv) of this note], bid, as any other bidder for property as defined in subsection 12(b)(7)(vii) [subsec. (b)(7)(vii) of this note],, [sic] wherever located, in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations of the Federal agency or instrumentality offering such property for sale. No preference right of any type will be offered to Cook Inlet Region Incorporated, for bidding on property under this section 12(b)(7) [subsec. (b)(7) of this note]. There shall be no advertising other than that ordinarily required by such sale. [sic] (b) the Administrator of General Services may, at the discretion of the Administrator, tender to the Secretary any surplus property otherwise to be disposed of pursuant to 40 U.S.C. 484(e)(3) [now 40 U.S.C. 545(b)] to be offered Cook Inlet Region, Incorporated for a period of 90 days so as to aid in the fulfillment of the Secretary's program purposes under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [this chapter]: Provided, That nothing in these subsections 12(b)(7)(i)(b) or (ii) [subsec. (b)(7)(i)(b) or (ii) of this note] shall be construed to establish, enlarge or diminish authority of the Administrator or the Secretary within the State of Alaska. Prior to any disposition under subsection 12(b)(7)(i)(b) [subsec. (b)(7)(i)(b) of this note], the Administrator shall notify the governing body of the locality where such property is located and any appropriate state agency, and no such disposition shall be made if such governing body or state agency, within ninety days of such notification formally advises the Administrator that it objects to the proposed disposition.
<br>
<br>"(ii) Subject to the exceptions stated in section 12(b)(9) [subsec. (b)(9) of this note], and notwithstanding the foregoing subsection 12(b)(7)(i) [subsec. (b)(7)(i) of this note] and any provision of any other law or any implementing regulation inconsistent with this subsection, until the obligations of the Secretary and the Administrator of General Services under section 12(b)(5) and (6) [subsec. (b)(5) and (6) of this note] are otherwise fulfilled:
<br>
<br>"(A) concurrently with the commencement of screening of any excess real property, wherever located, for utilization by Federal agencies, the Administrator of General Services shall notify the Region that such property may be available for conveyance to the Region upon negotiated sale. Within fifteen days of the date of receipt of such notice, the Region may advise the Administrator that there is a tentative need for the property to fulfill the obligations established under section 12(b)(5) and (6) [subsec. (b)(5) and (6) of this note]. If the Administrator determines the property should be disposed of by transfer to the Region, the Administrator or other appropriate Federal official shall promptly transfer such property;
<br>
<br>"(B) no disposition or conveyance of property under this subsection to the Region shall be made until the Administrator, after notice to affected State and local governments, has provided to them such opportunity to obtain the property as is recognized in title 40, United States Code and the regulations thereunder for the disposition or conveyance of surplus property; and
<br>
<br>"(C) as used in this subsection, 'real property' means any land or interests in land owned or held by the United States or any Federal agency, any improvements on such land or rights to their use or exploitation, and any personal property related to the land.
<br>
<br>"(iii) If the Region accepts any conveyance under section 12(b)(7)(i) or (ii) [subsec. (b)(7)(i) or (ii) of this note], it shall be in exchange for acres or acre-equivalents as provided in subparagraph I(C)(2)(e) of the document referred to in this section, except that, after the obligation of the Secretary and the Administrator under subparagraph I(C)(2)(g) of that document has been fulfilled, the acre-equivalents under subparagraph I(C)(2)(e)(iii)(A) shall be one-half the valued increment therein stated. The entitlement of the Region under section 12(b) of this Act [subsec. (b) of this note] shall be reduced by the number of acres or acre-equivalents attributed to the Region under this subsection. The Secretary and the Administrator are directed to execute an agreement with the Region which shall conform substantially to the 'Memorandum of Understanding Regarding the Implementation of Section 12(b)(7)', dated September 10, 1982, and submitted to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. The Secretary, the Administrator and the Region may thereafter otherwise agree to procedures to implement responsibilities under this section 12(b)(7) [subsec. (b)(7) of this note], including establishment of accounting procedures and the delegation or reassignment of duties under this statute.
<br>
<br>"(iv) The Secretary of the Treasury shall establish a Cook Inlet Region, Incorporated property account, which shall be available for the purpose of bidding on property, as defined in subsection 12(b)(7)(vii) [subsec. (b)(7)(vii) of this note], or paying for the conveyance of property pursuant to subsections 12(b)(7)(i) or (ii) [subsec. (b)(7)(i), (ii) of this note]. The balance of the account shall be the sum of (1) the acre-equivalent exchange value established by paragraph I(C)(2)(e)(iii)(A) of the document referred to in this subsection, of the unfulfilled entitlement of Cook Inlet Region, Incorporated, [on] December 2, 1980, to acre or acre-equivalents under paragraph I(C)(2)(g) of the document referred to in this subsection 12(b) [subsec. (b) of this note] and (2) one-half the acre or acre-equivalent exchange value under subparagraph I(C)(2)(e)(iii)(A) of seven townships fewer than the unfulfilled entitlement of the Region on the same date to acres or acre-equivalents under paragraph I(C)(1) of the document referred to in this section. The balance of the property account shall be adjusted in accordance with subsection 12(b)(7)(iii) [subsec. (b)(7)(iii) of this note] to reflect transfers or successful bids under section 12(b)(5) and (6) of this section [subsec. (b)(5) and (6) of this note] or payments of forfeited deposits, penalties, or other assessments imposed under a valid bid or sales contract on Cook Inlet Region, Incorporated.
<br>
<br>"(v) The amount charged against the Treasury account established under subsection 12(b)(7)(iv) [subsec. (b)(7)(iv) of this note] for sales or transfers of property made pursuant to the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, 40 U.S.C. sec. 471 et seq. [see chapters 1 to 11 of Title 40, Public Buildings, Property, and Works, and division C (except sections 3302, 3307(e), 3501(b), 3509, 3906, 4710, and 4711) of subtitle I of Title 41, Public Contracts], or any legislative or executive delegation under that Act, shall be treated as proceeds of dispositions of surplus property for the purpose of determining the basis for calculating direct expenses pursuant to 40 U.S.C. 485(b) [now 40 U.S.C. 572(a)], as amended.
<br>
<br>"(vi) The basis for computing gain or loss on subsequent sale or other disposition of lands or interests in land conveyed to Cook Inlet Region, Incorporated, under this subsection, for purposes of any Federal, State or local tax imposed on or measured by income, shall be the fair value of such land or interest in land at the time of receipt. The amount charged against Cook Inlet's entitlement under I(C)(2)(e) of the document referred to in subsection (b) of this section [subsec. (b) of this note] shall be prima facie evidence of such fair value.
<br>
<br>"(vii) Notwithstanding the definition of 'property' found in the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended [see 40 U.S.C. 102(9)], as used in this section 12(b)(7) [subsec. (b)(7) of this note], 'property' means any property—real, personal (including intangible assets sold or offered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Resolution Trust Corporation, such as financial instruments, notes, loans, and bonds), or mixed—owned, held, or controlled by the United States (including that in a corporate capacity or as a receiver or conservator, or such other similar fiduciary relationship), and offered for sale by any agency or instrumentality of the United States, including but not limited to the General Services Administration, Department of Defense, Department of the Interior, Department of Agriculture, Department of Housing and Urban Development, the United States Courts and any Government corporation, agency or instrumentality subject to chapter 91 of title 31, United States Code; real property means any land or interest in land or option to purchase land, any improvements on such lands, or rights to their use or exploitation.
<br>
<br>"(viii) Any charge against the property account and any transfer of funds from the property account heretofore made for the purpose of consummating any prior sale or making a deposit or other payment to bind any contract of sale or paying any forfeiture of deposit, penalty or assessment is hereby authorized, ratified and affirmed.
<br>
<br>"(8) Subject to the exceptions stated in section 12(b)(9) [subsec. (b)(9) of this note], and notwithstanding any provisions of law or implementing regulation inconsistent with this section:
<br>
<br>"(i) The deadlines in subparagraphs I(C)(2)(a) and (g) of the document referred to in this section shall be extended until the Secretary's obligations under section 12(b)(5) and (6) [subsec. (b)(5) and (6) of this note] are fulfilled: Provided, That:
<br>
<br>"(A) the obligation of the Secretary under subparagraph I(C)(2)(a) of such document shall terminate on such date, after July 15, 1984, that the Secretary has fulfilled his obligation under subparagraph I(C)(2)(g) of that document: Provided, That the obligation of the Secretary under subparagraph I(C)(2)(g) of such document shall be fulfilled at such date, after July 15, 1984, that the sum of the acres or acre-equivalents identified for and placed in the pool and the acres or acre-equivalents used by the Region in purchasing property under section 12(b)(7) [subsec. (b)(7) of this note] equals or exceeds 138,240 acres or acre-equivalents;
<br>
<br>"(B) the authority of the Secretary under subparagraphs I(C)(2)(b) and I(C)(2)(g)(ii) of such document to contribute to the pool created under subparagraph I(C)(2)(a) of such document shall terminate (a) on July 15, 1984, if, by that date, the Secretary has fulfilled his obligation under subparagraph I(C)(2)(g), or (b) if not, on such date after July 15, 1984 as such obligation is fulfilled, or (c) if such obligation remains unfulfilled, on July 15, 1987;
<br>
<br>"(C) the concurrence by the State as described in subparagraphs I(C)(2)(a)(vi) and I(C)(2)(c) of the document referred to in this section shall be deemed not required after the Secretary has fulfilled his obligation under subparagraph I(C)(2)(g) of that document, but in no event after July 15, 1987. In lieu of such concurrence, after 1984 as to military property, and after the Secretary has fulfilled his obligation under subparagraph I(C)(2)(g) of that document or July 15, 1987, whichever is earlier, as to any other property, except property of the Alaska Railroad which is governed by subsection 12(b)(6)(i)(D) of this Act [probably means subpar. (i)(D) of this paragraph], the Secretary shall not place any lands in the selection pool referred to in subparagraphs I(C)(2)(a) and (g) of the document referred to in this section without the prior written concurrence of the State. Such concurrence shall be deemed obtained unless the State advises the Secretary within ninety days of receipt of a formal notice from the Secretary that he is considering placing property in the selection pool, that the State, or a municipality of the State which includes all or part of the property in question, requires the property for a public purpose of the State or municipality; and
<br>
<br>"(D) notwithstanding section 606(a)(2) of the Alaska Railroad Transfer Act of 1982 [section 1205(a)(2) of Title 45, Railroads], the Secretary may include property of the Alaska Railroad in the pool of lands to be made available for selection to the extent that he is authorized to do so under a provision of section 12(b) of this Act [subsec. (b) of this note] if the State consents to its inclusion, which consent is not subject to any limitation under subsection 12(b)(8)(i)(C) herein: Provided, That, while the Alaska Railroad is the property of the United States, the Secretary shall obtain the consent of the Secretary of Transportation prior to including such property: And provided further, That, if the transfer of the Alaska Railroad to the State does not occur pursuant to the terms of the Alaska Railroad Transfer Act of 1982 [see Short Title note set out under section 1201 of Title 45] or any amendments thereto, the State's consent shall be deemed obtained unless the State advises the Secretary in writing, within ninety days of receipt of a formal notice from the Secretary that he is considering placing such property in the selection pool, that the State, or a municipality of the State which includes all or part of the property in question, requires the property for a public purpose of the State or the municipality.
<br>
<br>"(ii) In addition to the review required to identify public lands under section 3(e) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1602(e)), the Secretary shall identify for inclusion in the pool all public lands (as such term is used under section 3(e) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1602(e)), as described in subparagraph I(C)(2)(a)(v) of the document referred to in this section, and shall, in so doing, review all Federal installations within the boundaries of the Cook Inlet Region whether within or without the areas withdrawn pursuant to section 11 of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1610) or by the Secretary acting under authority contained in that section: Provided, That no such additional review under such subparagraph shall be required of military installations or of such other installations as may be mutually excluded from review by the Region and the Secretary: And provided further, That the Secretary shall not review any property of the Alaska Railroad unless such property becomes available for selection pursuant to subsection 12(b)(8)(i)(D) [subsec. (b)(8)(i)(D) of this note].
<br>
<br>"(iii) The concurrence required of the State as to the inclusion of any property in the pool under subparagraph I(C)(2)(b) of the document referred to in this section shall be deemed obtained unless the State advises the Secretary in writing, within ninety days of receipt of a formal notice from the Secretary that the Secretary is considering placing property in the selection pool, that the State, or a municipality of the State which includes all or part of the property in question requires the property for a public purpose of the State or the municipality.

<br>
<br>"(v) On or before January 15, 1985, the Secretary shall report to the Congress with respect to:
<br>
<br>"(A) such studies and inquiries as shall have been initiated by the Secretary and the Administrator of General Services, or have been prepared by other holding agencies, to determine what lands, except for lands held by the Alaska Railroad or the State-owned railroad, within the boundaries of the Cook Inlet Region or elsewhere can be made available to the Region, to the extent of its entitlement;

<br>"(9) No disposition or conveyance of property located within the State to the Region under section 12(b)(6), 12(b)(7) and 12(b)(8), as amended [subsec. (b)(6) to (8) of this note], shall be made if the property is subject to an express waiver of rights under the provisions of subparagraph I(C)(2)(f) of the document referred to in this section, or if such disposition or conveyance violates valid rights, including valid selections or valid authorized agreements, of Native Corporations (as such term is used in section 102(6) of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. 3102(6)) or the State existing at the time of such disposition or conveyance under section 6 of Public Law 85–508, as amended [set out as a note preceding section 21 of Title 48, Territories and Insular Possessions] (excepting section 906(e) of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act [section 1635(e) of this title]), sections 12(a), 12(b), 16(b) or 22(f) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [subsec.

If the State fails to agree to engage in a transfer with the Federal Government, pursuant to subsection (a)(1), the Secretary shall prior to December 18, 1976, make no conveyance of the lands that were to be conveyed to the Region in this section, nor shall he convey prior to such date the Point Campbell, Point Woronzof, and Campbell tracts, so that the Congress is not precluded from fashioning an appropriate remedy. In the event that the State fails to agree as aforesaid, all rights of the Region that may have been extinguished by this section shall be restored."

<br>All conveyances made pursuant to this chapter shall be subject to valid existing rights. Where, prior to patent of any land or minerals under this chapter, a lease, contract, permit, right-of-way, or easement (including a lease issued under section 6(g) of the Alaska Statehood Act) has been issued for the surface or minerals covered under such patent, the patent shall contain provisions making it subject to the lease, contract, permit, right-of-way, or easement, and the right of the lessee, contractee, permittee, or grantee to the complete enjoyment of all rights, privileges, and benefits thereby granted to him. Upon issuance of the patent, the patentee shall succeed and become entitled to any and all interests of the State or the United States as lessor, contractor, permitter, or grantor, in any such leases, contracts, permits, rights-of-way, or easements covering the estate patented, and a lease issued under section 6(g) of the Alaska Statehood Act shall be treated for all purposes as though the patent had been issued to the State. The administration of such lease, contract, permit, right-of-way, or easement shall continue to be by the State or the United States, unless the agency responsible for administration waives administration. In the event that the patent does not cover all of the land embraced within any such lease, contract, permit, right-of-way, or easement, the patentee shall only be entitled to the proportionate amount of the revenues reserved under such lease, contract, permit, right-of-way, or easement by the State or the United States which results from multiplying the total of such revenues by a fraction in which the numerator is the acreage of such lease, contract, permit, right-of-way, or easement which is included in the patent and the denominator is the total acreage contained in such lease, contract, permit, right-of-way, or easement.

<br>
<br>"(a)(1) During the period of the appropriate withdrawal for selection pursuant to the Settlement Act [this chapter], any and all proceeds derived from contracts, leases, licenses, permits, rights-of-way, or easements, or from trespass occurring after the date of withdrawal of the lands for selection, pertaining to lands or resources of lands, including wildlife proceeds received between the date of withdrawal and the date of conveyance from harvests on lands conveyed pursuant to the Act, withdrawn for Native selection pursuant to the Settlement Act shall be deposited in an escrow account which shall be held by the Secretary until lands selected pursuant to that Act have been conveyed to the selecting Corporation or individual entitled to receive benefits under such Act.
<br>
<br>"(2) Such proceeds which were received, if any, subsequent to the date of withdrawal of the land for selection, but were not deposited in the escrow account shall be identified by the Secretary within two years of the date of conveyance or this Act [probably means Dec. 2, 1980], whichever is later, and shall be paid, together with interest payable on the proceeds from the date of receipt by the United States to the date of payment to the appropriate Corporation or individual to which the land was conveyed by the United States: Provided, That the interest on proceeds received prior to January 2, 1976, shall be calculated and paid at the rate of the earnings on Individual Indian Moneys in the custody of the Secretary of the Interior pursuant to sections 463 and 465 of the Revised Statutes (25 U.S.C. 2 and 9) and invested by him pursuant to the Act of June 24, 1938 (25 U.S.C. 162a), from the date of receipt to January 2, 1976. Effective January 2, 1976, the interest so calculated shall be added to the principal amount of such proceeds. The interest on this total amount and on proceeds received on or after January 2, 1976, shall be calculated and paid as though such proceeds and previously calculated interest had been deposited in the escrow account from January 2, 1976, or the date of receipt, whichever occurs later, to the date of payment to the affected Corporation.[:] Provided further, That any rights of a Corporation or individual under this section to such proceeds shall be limited to proceeds actually received by the United States plus interest: And provided further, That moneys for such payments have been appropriated as provided in subsection (e) of this section.
<br>
<br>"(3) Such proceeds which have been deposited in the escrow account shall be paid, together with interest accrued by the Secretary to the appropriate Corporation or individual upon conveyance of the particular withdrawn lands. In the event that a conveyance does not cover all of the land embraced within any contract, lease, license, permit, right-of-way, easement, or trespass, the Corporation or individual shall only be entitled to the proportionate amount of the proceeds, including interest accrued, derived from such contract, lease, license, permit, right-of-way, or easement, which results from multiplying the total of such proceeds, including interest accrued, by a fraction in which the numerator is the acreage of such contract, lease, license, permit, right-of-way, or easement which is included in the conveyance and the denominator is the total acreage contained in such contract, lease, license, permit, right-of-way, or easement; in the case of trespass, the conveyee shall be entitled to the proportionate share of the proceeds, including a proportionate share of interest accrued, in relation to the damages occurring on the respective lands during the period the lands were withdrawn for selection.
<br>
<br>"(4) Such proceeds which have been deposited in the escrow account pertaining to lands withdrawn but not selected pursuant to such Act [this chapter], or selected but not conveyed due to rejection or relinquishment of the selection, shall be paid, together with interest accrued, as would have been required by law were it not for the provisions of this Act [enacting sections 1625 to 1627 of this title, amending sections 1615, 1616, 1620, and 1621 of this title, and enacting provisions set out as notes under sections 1604, 1605, 1611, 1613, 1618, and 1625 of this title].
<br>
<br>"(5) Lands withdrawn under this subsection include all Federal lands identified under appendices A, B–1, and B–2 of the document referred to in section 12 of the Act of January 2, 1976 (Public Law 94–204) [set out as a note under section 1611 of this title] for Cook Inlet Region, Incorporated, and are deemed withdrawn as of the date established in subsection (a) of section 2 of the Act of January 2, 1976 [this subsection].
<br>
<br>"(b) The Secretary is authorized to deposit in the Treasury of the United States the escrow account proceeds referred to in subsection (a) of this section, and the United States shall pay interest thereon semiannually from the date of deposit to the date of payment with simple interest at the rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury to be the rate payable on short-term obligations of the United States prevailing at the time of payment: Provided, That the Secretary in his discretion may withdraw such proceeds from the United States Treasury and reinvest such proceeds in the manner provided by the first section of the Act of June 24, 1938 (52 U.S.C. 1037) [section 162a of Title 25, Indians]: Provided further, That this section shall not be construed to create or terminate any trust relationship between the United States and any corporation or individual entitled to receive benefits under the Settlement Act [this chapter].
<br>
<br>"(c) Any and all proceeds from public easements reserved pursuant to section 17(b)(3) of the Settlement Act [section 1616(b)(3) of this title], from or after the date of enactment of this Act [Jan. 2, 1976], shall be paid to the grantee of such conveyance in accordance with such grantee's proportionate share.
<br>
<br>"(d) To the extent that there is a conflict between the provisions of this section and any other Federal laws applicable to Alaska, the provisions of this section will govern. Any payment made to any corporation or any individual under authority of this section shall not be subject to any prior obligation under section 9(d) or 9(f) of the Settlement Act [section 1608(d) or section 1608(f) of this title].
<br>
<br>"(e) The Secretary shall calculate the amounts payable pursuant to this section and notify the affected Corporation of the results of his calculations. The affected Corporation shall have thirty days in which to appeal the Secretary's calculations after which the Secretary shall promptly make a final determination of the amounts payable. The Secretary shall certify such final determinations to the Secretary of the Treasury and each determination shall constitute a final judgment, award, or compromise settlement under section 1304 of title 31 of the United States Code. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to pay such amounts to the appropriate Corporation out of funds in the Treasury: Provided, That if the lands from which the proceeds and interest entitlement are derived have not been conveyed to the selecting Native Corporation at the time the Secretary makes his final determination, the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to pay such amount into the escrow account where it will earn interest and be disbursed in the same manner as other proceeds and interest."

<br>§1614. Timber sale contracts; modification; timber from contingency area
<br>
<br>(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of existing National Forest timber sale contracts that are directly affected by conveyances authorized by this chapter, the Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to modify any such contract, with the consent of the purchaser, by substituting, to the extent practicable, timber on other national forest lands approximately equal in volume, species, grade, and accessibility for timber standing on any land affected by such conveyances, and, on request of the appropriate Village Corporation the Secretary of Agriculture is directed to make such substitution to the extent it is permitted by the timber sale contract without the consent of the purchaser.
<br>
<br>(b) No land conveyed to a Native Corporation pursuant to this chapter or by operation of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act which is within a contingency area designated in a timber sale contract let by the United States shall thereafter be subject to such contract or to entry or timbering by the contractor. Until a Native Corporation has received conveyances to all of the land to which it is entitled to receive under the appropriate section or subsection of this chapter, for which the land was withdrawn or selected, no land in such a contingency area that has been withdrawn and selected, or selected, by such Corporation under this chapter shall be entered by the timber contractor and no timber shall be cut thereon, except by agreement with such Corporation. For purposes of this subsection, the term "contingency area" means any area specified in a timber sale contract as an area from which the timber contractor may harvest timber if the volume of timber specified in the contract cannot be obtained from one or more areas definitely designated for timbering in the contract.

<br>§1616. Joint Federal-State Land Use Planning Commission for Alaska
<br>(a) Omitted
<br>(b) Public easements; continuance of access rights under valid existing rights
<br>
<br>(1) The Planning Commission shall identify public easements across lands selected by Village Corporations and the Regional Corporations and at periodic points along the courses of major waterways which are reasonably necessary to guarantee international treaty obligations, a full right of public use and access for recreation, hunting, transportation, utilities, docks, and such other public uses as the Planning Commission determines to be important.
<br>
<br>(2) In identifying public easements the Planning Commission shall consult with appropriate State and Federal agencies, shall review proposed transportation plans, and shall receive and review statements and recommendations from interested organizations and individuals on the need for and proposed location of public easements: Provided, That any valid existing right recognized by this chapter shall continue to have whatever right of access as is now provided for under existing law and this subsection shall not operate in any way to diminish or limit such right of access.
<br>
<br>(3) Prior to granting any patent under this chapter to the Village Corporation and Regional Corporations, the Secretary shall consult with the State and the Planning Commission and shall reserve such public easements as he determines are necessary.
<br>(c) Prohibition against selection of lands from withdrawn area in event of withdrawal of utility and transportation corridor across public lands
<br>
<br>In the event that the Secretary withdraws a utility and transportation corridor across public lands in Alaska pursuant to his existing authority, the State, the Village Corporations and the Regional Corporations shall not be permitted to select lands from the area withdrawn.
<br>(d) Public Land Order Numbered 4582 revoked; withdrawal of unreserved public lands; classification and reclassification of lands; opening lands to appropriation; administration; contracting and other authority of Secretary not impaired by withdrawal
<br>
<br>(1) Public Land Order Numbered 4582, 34 Federal Register 1025, as amended, is hereby revoked. For a period of ninety days after December 18, 1971, all unreserved public lands in Alaska are hereby withdrawn from all forms of appropriation under the public land laws, including the mining (except locations for metalliferous minerals) and the mineral leasing laws. During this period of time the Secretary shall review the public lands in Alaska and determine whether any portion of these lands should be withdrawn under authority provided for in existing law to insure that the public interest in these lands is properly protected. Any further withdrawal shall require an affirmative act by the Secretary under his existing authority, and the Secretary is authorized to classify or reclassify any lands so withdrawn and to open such lands to appropriation under the public land laws in accord with his classifications. Withdrawals pursuant to this paragraph shall not affect the authority of the Village Corporations, the Regional Corporations, and the State to make selections and obtain patents within the areas withdrawn pursuant to section 1610 of this title.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) The Secretary, acting under authority provided for in existing law, is directed to withdraw from all forms of appropriation under the public land laws, including the mining and mineral leasing laws, and from selection under the Alaska Statehood Act, and from selection by Regional Corporations pursuant to section 1610 of this title, up to, but not to exceed, eighty million acres of unreserved public lands in the State of Alaska, including previously classified lands, which the Secretary deems are suitable for addition to or creation as units of the National Park, Forest, Wildlife Refuge, and Wild and Scenic Rivers Systems: Provided, That such withdrawals shall not affect the authority of the State and the Regional and Village Corporations to make selections and obtain patents within the areas withdrawn pursuant to section 1610 of this title.
<br>
<br>(B) Lands withdrawn pursuant to paragraph (A) hereof must be withdrawn within nine months of December 18, 1971. All unreserved public lands not withdrawn under paragraph (A) or subsection (d)(1) shall be available for selection by the State and for appropriation under the public land laws.
<br>
<br>(C) Every six months, for a period of two years from December 18, 1971, the Secretary shall advise the Congress of the location, size and values of lands withdrawn pursuant to paragraph (A) and submit his recommendations with respect to such lands. Any lands withdrawn pursuant to paragraph (A) not recommended for addition to or creation as units of the National Park, Forest, Wildlife Refuge, and Wild and Scenic Rivers Systems at the end of the two years shall be available for selection by the State and the Regional Corporations, and for appropriations under the public land laws.
<br>
<br>(D) Areas recommended by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (C) shall remain withdrawn from any appropriation under the public land laws until such time as the Congress acts on the Secretary's recommendations, but not to exceed five years from the recommendation dates. The withdrawal of areas not so recommended shall terminate at the end of the two year period.
<br>
<br>(E) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, initial identification of lands desired to be selected by the State pursuant to the Alaska Statehood Act and by the Regional Corporations pursuant to section 1611 of this title may be made within any area withdrawn pursuant to this subsection (d), but such lands shall not be tentatively approved or patented so long as the withdrawals of such areas remain in effect: Provided, That selection of lands by Village Corporations pursuant to section 1611 of this title shall not be affected by such withdrawals and such lands selected may be patented and such rights granted as authorized by this chapter. In the event Congress enacts legislation setting aside any areas withdrawn under the provisions of this subsection which the Regional Corporations or the State desired to select, then other unreserved public lands shall be made available for alternative selection by the Regional Corporations and the State. Any time periods established by law for Regional Corporations or State selections are hereby extended to the extent that delays are caused by compliance with the provisions of this subsection (2).
<br>
<br>(3) Any lands withdrawn under this section shall be subject to administration by the Secretary under applicable laws and regulations, and his authority to make contracts and to grant leases, permits, rights-of-way, or easements shall not be impaired by the withdrawal.

<br>§1617. Revocation of Indian allotment authority in Alaska
<br>(a) Revocation of authority
<br>
<br>No Native covered by the provisions of this chapter, and no descendant of his, may hereafter avail himself of an allotment under the provisions of the Act of February 8, 1887 (24 Stat. 389), as amended and supplemented, or the Act of June 25, 1910 (36 Stat. 363). Further, the Act of May 17, 1906 (34 Stat. 197), as amended, is repealed. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, any application for an allotment that is pending before the Department of the Interior on December 18, 1971, may, at the option of the Native applicant, be approved and a patent issued in accordance with said 1887, 1910, or 1906 Act, as the case may be, in which event the Native shall not be eligible for a patent under section 1613(h)(5) of this title.
<br>(b) Charging allotment against statutory grant
<br>
<br>Any allotments approved pursuant to this section during the four years following December 18, 1971, shall be charged against the two million acre grant provided for in section 1613(h) of this title.
<br>(c) Relocation of allotment
<br>
<br>(1)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an allotment applicant, who had a valid application pending before the Department of the Interior on December 18, 1971, and whose application remains pending as of October 14, 1992, may amend the land description in the application of the applicant (with the advice and approval of the responsible officer of the Bureau of Indian Affairs) to describe land other than the land that the applicant originally intended to claim if—
<br>
<br>(i) the application pending before the Department, either describes land selected by, tentatively approved to, or patented to the State of Alaska or otherwise conflicts with an interest in land granted to the State of Alaska by the United States prior to the filing of the allotment application;
<br>
<br>(ii) the amended land description describes land selected by, tentatively approved to, or patented to the State of Alaska of approximately equal acreage in substitution for the land described in the original application; and
<br>
<br>(iii) the Commissioner of the Department of Natural Resources for the State of Alaska, acting under the authority of State law, has agreed to reconvey or relinquish to the United States the land, or interest in land, described in the amended application.
<br>
<br>(B) If an application pending before the Department of the Interior as described in subparagraph (A) describes land selected by, but not tentatively approved to or patented to, the State of Alaska, the concurrence of the Secretary of the Interior shall be required in order for an application to proceed under this section.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) The Secretary shall accept reconveyance or relinquishment from the State of Alaska of the land described in an amended application pursuant to paragraph (1)(A), except where the land described in the amended application is State-owned land within the boundaries of a conservation system unit as defined in the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. Upon acceptance, the Secretary shall issue a Native Allotment certificate to the applicant for the land reconveyed or relinquished by the State of Alaska to the United States.
<br>
<br>(B) The Secretary shall adjust the computation of the acreage charged against the land entitlement of the State of Alaska to ensure that this subsection will not cause the State to receive either more or less than its full land entitlement under section 6 of the Act entitled "An Act to provide for the admission of the State of Alaska into the Union", approved July 7, 1958 (commonly referred to as the "Alaska Statehood Act"), and section 906 of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (43 U.S.C. 1635). If the State retains any part of the fee estate, the State shall remain charged with the acreage.
<br>(d) Correction of conveyance documents
<br>
<br>(1) If an allotment application is valid or would have been approved under section 1634 of this title had the land described in the application been in Federal ownership on December 2, 1980, the Secretary may correct a conveyance to a Native Corporation or to the State that includes land described in the allotment application to exclude the described allotment land with the written concurrence of the Native Corporation or the State.
<br>
<br>(2) A written concurrence shall—
<br>
<br>(A) include a finding that the land description proposed by the Secretary is acceptable; and
<br>
<br>(B) attest that the Native Corporation or the State has not—
<br>
<br>(i) granted any third party rights or taken any other action that would affect the ability of the United States to convey full title under the Act of May 17, 1906 (34 Stat. 197, chapter 2469); and
<br>
<br>(ii) stored or allowed the deposit of hazardous waste on the land.
<br>
<br>(3) On receipt of an acceptable written concurrence, the Secretary, shall—
<br>
<br>(A) issue a corrected conveyance document to the State or Native Corporation, as appropriate; and
<br>
<br>(B) issue a certificate of allotment to the allotment applicant.
<br>
<br>(4) No documents of reconveyance from the State or an Alaska Native Corporation or evidence of title, other than the written concurrence and attestation described in paragraph (2), are necessary to use the procedures authorized by this subsection.
<br>(e) Native allotment revisions on land selected by or conveyed to a Native Corporation
<br>
<br>(1) An allotment applicant who had an application pending before the Department of the Interior on December 18, 1971, and whose application is still open on the records of the Department of the Interior as of December 10, 2004, may revise the land description in the application to describe land other than the land that the applicant originally intended to claim if—
<br>
<br>(A) the application—
<br>
<br>(i) describes land selected by or conveyed by interim conveyance or patent to a Native Corporation formed to receive benefits under this chapter; or
<br>
<br>(ii) otherwise conflicts with an interest in land granted to a Native Corporation by the United States;
<br>
<br>(B) the revised land description describes land selected by or conveyed by interim conveyance or patent to a Native Corporation of approximately equal acreage in substitution for the land described in the original application;
<br>
<br>(C) the Director of the Bureau of Land Management has not adopted a final plan of survey for the final entitlement of the Native Corporation or its successor in interest; and
<br>
<br>(D) the Native Corporation that selected the land or its successor in interest provides a corporate resolution authorizing reconveyance or relinquishment to the United States of the land, or interest in land, described in the revised application.
<br>
<br>(2) The land description in an allotment application may not be revised under this section unless the Secretary has determined—
<br>
<br>(A) that the allotment application is valid or would have been approved under section 1634 of this title had the land in the allotment application been in Federal ownership on December 2, 1980;
<br>
<br>(B) in consultation with the administering agency, that the proposed revision would not create an isolated inholding within a conservation system unit (as defined in section 3102 of title 16); and
<br>
<br>(C) that the proposed revision will facilitate completion of a land transfer in the State.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) On obtaining title evidence acceptable under Department of Justice title standards and acceptance of a reconveyance or relinquishment from a Native Corporation under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall issue a Native allotment certificate to the applicant for the land reconveyed or relinquished by the Native Corporation.
<br>
<br>(B) Any allotment revised under this section shall, when allotted, be made subject to any easement, trail, right-of-way, or any third-party interest (other than a fee interest) in existence on the revised allotment land on the date of revision.
<br>(f) Reinstatements and reconstructions
<br>
<br>(1) If an applicant for a Native allotment filed under the Act of May 17, 1906 (34 Stat. 197, chapter 2469) petitions the Secretary to reinstate a previously closed Native allotment application or to accept a reconstructed copy of an application claimed to have been timely filed with an agency of the Department of the Interior, the United States—
<br>
<br>(A) may seek voluntary reconveyance of any land described in the application that is reinstated or reconstructed after December 10, 2004; but
<br>
<br>(B) shall not file an action in any court to recover title from a current landowner.
<br>
<br>(2) A certificate of allotment that is issued for any allotment application for which a request for reinstatement or reconstruction is received or accepted after December 10, 2004 shall be made subject to any Federal appropriation, trail, right-of-way, easement, or existing third party interest of record, including third party interests created by the State, without regard to the date on which the Native allotment applicant initiated use and occupancy.
