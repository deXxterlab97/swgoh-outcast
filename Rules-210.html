<br>

<br>
<br>(3) A phased retiree—
<br>
<br>(A) may not be employed in more than one position at any time; and
<br>
<br>(B) may transfer to another position in the same or a different agency, only if the transfer does not result in a change in the working percentage.
<br>
<br>(4) A retirement-eligible employee may make not more than one election under this subsection during the retirement-eligible employee's lifetime.
<br>
<br>(5) A retirement-eligible employee who makes an election under this subsection may not make an election under section 8420a.
<br>
<br>(c)(1) Except as otherwise provided under this subsection, the phased retirement annuity for a phased retiree is the product obtained by multiplying—
<br>
<br>(A) the amount of an annuity computed under section 8415 that would have been payable to the phased retiree if, on the date on which the phased retiree enters phased retirement status, the phased retiree had separated from service and retired under section 8412 (a) or (b); by
<br>
<br>(B) the phased retirement percentage for the phased retiree.
<br>
<br>(2) A phased retirement annuity shall be paid in addition to the basic pay for the position to which a phased retiree is appointed during the phased employment.
<br>
<br>(3) A phased retirement annuity shall be adjusted in accordance with section 8462.
<br>
<br>(4)(A) A phased retirement annuity shall not be subject to reduction for any form of survivor annuity, shall not serve as the basis of the computation of any survivor annuity, and shall not be subject to any court order requiring a survivor annuity to be provided to any individual.
<br>
<br>(B) A phased retirement annuity shall be subject to a court order providing for division, allotment, assignment, execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process on the same basis as other annuities.

<br>(5)(A) Any deposit, or election of an actuarial annuity reduction in lieu of a deposit, for military service or for creditable civilian service for which retirement deductions were not made or refunded, shall be made by a retirement-eligible employee at or before the time the retirement-eligible employee enters phased retirement status. No such deposit may be made, or actuarial adjustment in lieu thereof elected, at the time a phased retiree enters full retirement status.
<br>
<br>(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), if a phased retiree does not make such a deposit and dies in service as a phased retiree, a survivor of the phased retiree shall have the same right to make such deposit as would have been available had the employee not entered phased retirement status and died in service.
<br>
<br>(6) A phased retirement annuity shall commence on the date on which a phased retiree enters phased employment.

<br>(7) No unused sick leave credit may be used in the computation of the phased retirement annuity.

<br>
<br>(f)(1) Except as provided otherwise under this subsection, a composite retirement annuity is a single annuity computed under regulations prescribed by the Director, equal to the sum of—
<br>
<br>(A) the amount of the phased retirement annuity as of the date of full retirement, including any adjustments made under section 8462; and
<br>
<br>(B) the product obtained by multiplying—
<br>
<br>(i) the amount of an annuity computed under section 8412 that would have been payable at the time of full retirement if the individual had not elected a phased retirement and as if the individual was employed on a full-time basis in the position occupied during the phased retirement period and before any adjustment to provide for a survivor annuity; by
<br>
<br>(ii) the working percentage.
<br>
<br>(2) After computing a composite retirement annuity under paragraph (1), the Director shall adjust the amount of the annuity for any applicable reductions for a survivor annuity.
<br>
<br>(3) A composite retirement annuity shall be adjusted in accordance with section 8462, except that subsection (c)(1) of that section shall not apply.
<br>
<br>(4) In computing a composite retirement annuity under paragraph (1)(B)(i), the unused sick leave to the credit of a phased retiree at the time of entry into full retirement status shall be adjusted by dividing the number of hours of unused sick leave by the working percentage.
<br>
<br>(g)(1) Under such procedures and conditions as the Director may provide, and with the concurrence of the head of employing agency, a phased retiree may elect to terminate phased retirement status and return to a full-time work schedule.
<br>
<br>(2) Upon entering a full-time work schedule based on an election under paragraph (1), the phased retirement annuity of a phased retiree shall terminate.
<br>
<br>(3) After termination of the phased retirement annuity under this subsection, the individual's rights under this chapter shall be determined based on the law in effect at the time of any subsequent separation from service. For purposes of this chapter, at the time of the subsequent separation from service, the phased retirement period shall be treated as if it had been a period of part-time employment with the work schedule described in subsection (b)(2).
<br>
<br>(h) For purposes of subchapter IV—
<br>
<br>(1) the death of a phased retiree shall be deemed to be the death in service of an employee;
<br>
<br>(2) except for purposes of section 8442(b)(1)(A)(i), the phased retirement period shall be deemed to have been a period of part-time employment with the work schedule described in subsection (b)(2) of this section; and
<br>
<br>(3) for purposes of section 8442(b)(1)(A)(i), the phased retiree shall be deemed to have been at the full-time rate of pay for the position occupied.
<br>
<br>(i) Employment of a phased retiree shall not be deemed to be part-time career employment, as defined in section 3401(2).
<br>
<br>(j) A phased retiree is not eligible to receive an annuity supplement under section 8421.
<br>
<br>(k) For purposes of subchapter III, a phased retiree shall be deemed to be an employee.
<br>
<br>(l) For purposes of section 8445(d), retirement shall be deemed to occur on the date on which a phased retiree enters into full retirement status.

<br>(m) A phased retiree is not eligible to apply for an annuity under subchapter V.

<br>§8415. Computation of basic annuity
<br>
<br>(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the annuity of an employee retiring under this subchapter is 1 percent of that individual's average pay multiplied by such individual's total service.
<br>
<br>(b) The annuity of a Member, or former Member with title to a Member annuity, retiring under this subchapter is computed under subsection (a), except that if the individual has had at least 5 years of service as a Member or Congressional employee, or any combination thereof, so much of the annuity as is computed with respect to either such type of service (or a combination thereof), not exceeding a total of 20 years, shall be computed by multiplying 17/10 percent of the individual's average pay by the years of such service.
<br>
<br>(c) The annuity of a Congressional employee, or former Congressional employee, retiring under this subchapter is computed under subsection (a), except that if the individual has had at least 5 years of service as a Congressional employee or Member, or any combination thereof, so much of the annuity as is computed with respect to either such type of service (or a combination thereof), not exceeding a total of 20 years, shall be computed by multiplying 17/10 percent of the individual's average pay by the years of such service.
<br>
<br>(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the annuity of an individual described in subsection (b) or (c) who is a revised annuity employee or a further revised annuity employee shall be computed in the same manner as in the case of an individual described in subsection (a).
<br>
<br>(e) The annuity of an employee retiring under subsection (d) or (e) of section 8412 or under subsection (a), (b), or (c) of section 8425 is—
<br>
<br>(1) 17/10 percent of that individual's average pay multiplied by so much of such individual's total service as does not exceed 20 years; plus
<br>
<br>(2) 1 percent of that individual's average pay multiplied by so much of such individual's total service as exceeds 20 years.
<br>
<br>(f) The annuity of an air traffic controller or former air traffic controller retiring under section 8412(a) is computed under subsection (a), except that if the individual has at least 5 years of service in any combination as—

<br>(1) an air traffic controller as defined by section 2109(1)(A)(i);
<br>
<br>(2) a first level supervisor of an air traffic controller as defined by section 2109(1)(A)(i); or
<br>
<br>(3) a second level supervisor of an air traffic controller as defined by section 2109(1)(A)(i);
<br>
<br>so much of the annuity as is computed with respect to such type of service shall be computed by multiplying 1 7/10 percent of the individual's average pay by the years of such service.
<br>
<br>(g)(1) In computing an annuity under this subchapter for an employee whose service includes service performed on a part-time basis—
<br>
<br>(A) the average pay of the employee, to the extent that it includes pay for service performed in any position on a part-time basis, shall be determined by using the annual rate of basic pay that would be payable for full-time service in the position; and
<br>
<br>(B) the benefit so computed shall then be multiplied by a fraction equal to the ratio which the employee's actual service, as determined by prorating the employee's total service to reflect the service that was performed on a part-time basis, bears to the total service that would be creditable for the employee if all of the service had been performed on a full-time basis.
<br>
<br>(2) For the purpose of this subsection, employment on a part-time basis shall not be considered to include employment on a temporary or intermittent basis.
<br>
<br>(h)(1) The annuity of an employee or Member retiring under section 8412(g) or 8413(b) is computed in accordance with applicable provisions of this section, except that the annuity shall be reduced by five-twelfths of 1 percent for each full month by which the commencement date of the annuity precedes the sixty-second anniversary of the birth of the employee or Member.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) Paragraph (1) does not apply in the case of an employee or Member retiring under section 8412(g) or 8413(b) if the employee or Member would satisfy the age and service requirements for title to an annuity under section 8412(a), (b), (d)(2), (e)(2), or (f)(2), determined as if the employee or Member had, as of the date of separation, attained the age specified in subparagraph (B).

<br>(B) A determination under subparagraph (A) shall be based on how old the employee or Member will be as of the date on which the annuity under section 8412(g) or 8413(b) is to commence.
<br>
<br>(i)(1) In applying subsection (a) with respect to an employee under paragraph (2), the percentage applied under such subsection shall be 1.1 percent, rather than 1 percent.
<br>
<br>(2) This subsection applies in the case of an employee who—
<br>
<br>(A) retires entitled to an annuity under section 8412; and
<br>
<br>(B) at the time of the separation on which entitlement to the annuity is based, is at least 62 years of age and has completed at least 20 years of service;
<br>
<br>but does not apply in the case of a Congressional employee, military technician (dual status), law enforcement officer, member of the Supreme Court Police, firefighter, nuclear materials courier, air traffic controller, or customs and border protection officer 1
<br>
<br>(j) The annuity of a Member who has served in a position in the executive branch for which the rate of basic pay was reduced for the duration of the service of the Member in that position to remove the impediment to the appointment of the Member imposed by article I, section 6, clause 2 of the Constitution, shall, subject to a deposit in the Fund as provided under section 8422(g), be computed as though the rate of basic pay which would otherwise have been in effect during that period of service had been in effect.
<br>
<br>(k)(1) For purposes of this subsection, the term "physicians comparability allowance" refers to an amount described in section 8331(3)(H).
<br>
<br>(2) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, no part of a physicians comparability allowance shall be treated as basic pay for purposes of any computation under this section unless, before the date of the separation on which entitlement to annuity is based, the separating individual has completed at least 15 years of service as a Government physician (whether performed before, on, or after the date of the enactment of this subsection).
<br>
<br>(3) If the condition under paragraph (2) is met, then, any amounts received by the individual in the form of a physicians comparability allowance shall (for the purposes referred to in paragraph (2)) be treated as basic pay, but only to the extent that such amounts are attributable to service performed on or after the date of the enactment of this subsection, and only to the extent of the percentage allowable, which shall be determined as follows:
<br>  If the total amount of service
<br>
<br> performed, on or after the date of
<br>
<br> the enactment of this subsection,
<br>
<br> as a Government physician is:
<br>	Then, the percentage allowable is:
<br>Less than 2 years 	0  
<br>At least 2 but less than 4 years 	25  
<br>At least 4 but less than 6 years 	50  
<br>At least 6 but less than 8 years 	75  
<br>At least 8 years 	100.
<br>
<br>(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, 100 percent of all amounts received as a physicians comparability allowance shall, to the extent attributable to service performed on or after the date of the enactment of this subsection, be treated as basic pay (without regard to any of the preceding provisions of this subsection) for purposes of computing—
<br>
<br>(A) an annuity under section 8452; and
<br>
<br>(B) a survivor annuity under subchapter IV, if based on the service of an individual who dies before separating from service.
<br>
<br>(l) The annuity of an employee retiring under this chapter with service credited under section 8411(b)(6) shall be reduced by the amount necessary to ensure that the present value of the annuity payable to the employee under this subchapter is actuarially equivalent to the present value of the annuity that would be payable to the employee under this subchapter if it were computed—
<br>
<br>(1) on the basis of service that does not include service credited under section 8411(b)(6); and
<br>
<br>(2) assuming the employee separated from service on the actual date of the separation of the employee.
<br>
<br>The amount of the reduction shall be computed under regulations prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management for the administration of this subsection.
<br>
<br>(m)(1) In computing an annuity under this subchapter, the total service of an employee who retires from the position of a registered nurse with the Veterans Health Administration on an immediate annuity, or dies while employed in that position leaving any survivor entitled to an annuity, includes the days of unused sick leave to the credit of that employee under a formal leave system, except that such days shall not be counted in determining average pay or annuity eligibility under this subchapter.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) Except as provided in paragraph (1), in computing an annuity under this subchapter, the total service of an employee who retires on an immediate annuity or who dies leaving a survivor or survivors entitled to annuity includes the applicable percentage of the days of unused sick leave to his credit under a formal leave system and for which days the employee has not received payment, except that these days will not be counted in determining average pay or annuity eligibility under this subchapter. For purposes of this subsection, in the case of any such employee who is excepted from subchapter I of chapter 63 under section 6301(2)(x) through (xiii), the days of unused sick leave to his credit include any unused sick leave standing to his credit when he was excepted from such subchapter.
<br>
<br>(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term "applicable percentage" means—
<br>
<br>(i) 50 percent in the case of an annuity, entitlement to which is based on a death or other separation occurring during the period beginning on the date of enactment of this paragraph and ending on December 31, 2013; and
<br>
<br>(ii) 100 percent in the case of an annuity, entitlement to which is based on a death or other separation occurring after December 31, 2013.
<br>
<br>(n) In the case of any annuity computation under this section that includes, in the aggregate, at least 2 months of credit under section 8411(d) for any period while receiving benefits under subchapter I of chapter 81, the percentage otherwise applicable under this section for that period so credited shall be increased by 1 percentage point.

<br>§8416. Survivor reduction for a current spouse
<br>
<br>(a)(1) If an employee or Member is married at the time of retiring under this chapter, the reduction described in section 8419(a) shall be made unless the employee or Member and the spouse jointly waive, by written election, any right which the spouse may have to a survivor annuity under section 8442 based on the service of such employee or Member. A waiver under this paragraph shall be filed with the Office under procedures prescribed by the Office.
<br>
<br>(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), an employee or Member who is married at the time of retiring under this chapter may waive the annuity for a surviving spouse without the spouse's consent if the employee or Member establishes to the satisfaction of the Office (in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Office)—
<br>
<br>(A) that the spouse's whereabouts cannot be determined; or
<br>
<br>(B) that, due to exceptional circumstances, requiring the employee or Member to seek the spouse's consent would otherwise be inappropriate.
<br>
<br>(3) Except as provided in subsection (d), a waiver made under this subsection shall be irrevocable.
<br>
<br>(b)(1) Upon remarriage, a retired employee or Member who was married at the time of retirement (including an employee or Member whose annuity was not reduced to provide a survivor annuity for the employee's or Member's spouse or former spouse as of the time of retirement) may irrevocably elect during such marriage, in a signed writing received by the Office within 2 years after such remarriage or, if later, within 2 years after the death or remarriage of any former spouse of such employee or Member who was entitled to a survivor annuity under section 8445 (or of the last such surviving former spouse, if there was more than one), a reduction in the employee's or Member's annuity under section 8419(a) for the purpose of providing an annuity for such employee's or Member's spouse in the event such spouse survives the employee or Member.
<br>
<br>(2) The election and reduction shall be effective the first day of the second month after the election is received by the Office, but not less than 9 months after the date of the remarriage.
<br>
<br>(3) An election to provide a survivor annuity to an individual under this subsection—
<br>
<br>(A) shall prospectively void any election made by the employee or Member under section 8420 with respect to such individual; or
<br>
<br>(B) shall, if an election was made by the employee or Member under section 8420 with respect to a different individual, prospectively void such election if appropriate written application is made by such employee or Member at the time of making the election under this subsection.
<br>
<br>(4) Any election under this subsection made by an employee or Member on behalf of an individual after the retirement of such employee or Member shall not be effective if—
<br>
<br>(A) the employee or Member was married to such individual at the time of retirement; and
<br>
<br>(B) the annuity rights of such individual based on the service of such employee or Member were then waived under subsection (a).
<br>
<br>(c)(1) An employee or Member who is unmarried at the time of retiring under this chapter and who later marries may irrevocably elect, in a signed writing received by the Office within 2 years after such employee or Member marries or, if later, within 2 years after the death or remarriage of any former spouse of such employee or Member who was entitled to a survivor annuity under section 8445 (or of the last such surviving former spouse, if there was more than one), a reduction in the current annuity of the retired employee or Member, in accordance with section 8419(a).
<br>
<br>(2) The election and reduction shall take effect the first day of the first month beginning 9 months after the date of marriage. Any such election to provide a survivor annuity for an individual—
<br>
<br>(A) shall prospectively void any election made by the employee or Member under section 8420 with respect to such individual; or
<br>
<br>(B) shall, if an election was made by the employee or Member under section 8420 with respect to a different individual, prospectively void such election if appropriate written application is made by such employee or Member at the time of making the election under this subsection.
<br>
<br>(d)(1) An employee or Member—
<br>
<br>(A) who is married on the date of retiring under this chapter, and
<br>
<br>(B) with respect to whose spouse a waiver under subsection (a) has been made,
<br>
<br>may, during the 18-month period beginning on such date, elect to have a reduction made under section 8419 in order to provide a survivor annuity under section 8442 for such spouse.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) An election under this subsection shall not be effective unless the amount described in subparagraph (B) is deposited into the Fund before the expiration of the 18-month period referred to in paragraph (1).
<br>
<br>(B) The amount to be deposited under this subparagraph is equal to the sum of—
<br>
<br>(i) the difference (for the period between the date on which the annuity of the former employee or Member commences and the date on which reductions pursuant to the election under this subsection commence) between the amount paid to the former employee or Member from the Fund under this chapter and the amount which would have been paid if such election had been made at the time of retirement; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the costs associated with providing for the election under this subsection.
<br>
<br>The amount to be deposited under clause (i) shall include interest, computed at the rate of 6 percent a year.
<br>
<br>(3) An annuity which is reduced pursuant to an election by a former employee or Member under this subsection shall be reduced by the same percentage as was in effect under section 8419 as of the date of the employee's or Member's retirement.
<br>
<br>(4) Rights and obligations under this chapter resulting from an election under this subsection shall be the same as the rights and obligations which would have resulted had the election been made at the time of retirement.
<br>
<br>(5) The Office shall inform each employee and Member who is eligible to make an election under this subsection of the right to make such election and the procedures and deadlines applicable in making any such election.
<br>
<br>(Added Pub. L. 99–335, title I, §101(a), June 6, 1986, 100 Stat. 528.)
<br>§8417. Survivor reduction for a former spouse
<br>
<br>(a) If an employee or Member has a former spouse who is entitled to a survivor annuity as provided in section 8445, the reduction described in section 8419(a) shall be made.
<br>
<br>(b)(1) An employee or Member who has a former spouse may elect, under procedures prescribed by the Office, a reduction in the annuity of the employee or Member under section 8419(a) in order to provide a survivor annuity for such former spouse under section 8445.
<br>
<br>(2) An election under this subsection shall be made at the time of retirement or, if the marriage is dissolved after the date of retirement, within 2 years after the date on which the marriage of the former spouse to the employee or Member is so dissolved.
<br>
<br>(3) An election under this subsection—
<br>
<br>(A) shall not be effective to the extent that it—
<br>
<br>(i) conflicts with—
<br>
<br>(I) any court order or decree referred to in section 8445(a) which was issued before the date of such election; or
<br>
<br>(II) any agreement referred to in such section 8445(a) which was entered into before such date; or
<br>
<br>(ii) would cause the total of survivor annuities payable under sections 8442 and 8445, respectively, based on the service of the employee or Member to exceed the amount which would be payable to a widow or widower of such employee or Member under such section 8442 (determined without regard to any reduction to provide for an annuity under such section 8445); and
<br>
<br>(B) shall not be effective, in the case of an employee or Member who is then married, unless it is made with the spouse's written consent.
<br>
<br>The Office shall by regulation provide that subparagraph (B) may be waived for either of the reasons set forth in section 8416(a)(2).

<br>(a)(1) An individual who makes an election under subsection (b) or (c) of section 8416 or section 8417(b) which is required to be made within 2 years after the date of a prescribed event shall deposit into the Fund an amount determined by the Office (as nearly as may be administratively feasible) to reflect the amount by which the annuity of such individual would have been reduced if the election had been in effect since the date of retirement (or, if later, and in the case of an election under such section 8416(b), since the date the previous reduction in the annuity of such individual was terminated under paragraph (1) or (2) of section 8419(b)), plus interest.
<br>
<br>(2) Interest under paragraph (1) shall be computed at the rate of 6 percent a year.
<br>
<br>(b) The Office shall, by regulation, provide for payment of the deposit required under subsection (a) by a reduction in the annuity of the employee or Member. The reduction shall, to the extent practicable, be designed so that the present value of the future reduction is actuarially equivalent to the deposit required under subsection (a), except that the total reductions in the annuity of an employee or Member to pay deposits required by this section shall not exceed 25 percent of the annuity computed under section 8415 or section 8452, including adjustments under section 8462. The reduction required by this subsection, which shall be effective at the same time as the election under section 8416(b) and (c) or section 8417(b), shall be permanent and unaffected by any future termination of the marriage or the entitlement of the former spouse. Such reduction shall be independent of and in addition to the reduction required under section 8416(b) and (c) or section 8417(b).
<br>
<br>(c) Subsections (a) and (b) shall not apply if—
<br>
<br>(1) the employee or Member makes an election under section 8416(b) or (c) after having made an election under section 8420; and
<br>
<br>(2) the election under such section 8420 becomes void under subsection (b)(3) or (c)(2) of such section 8416.

<br>§8421. Annuity supplement
<br>
<br>(a)(1) Subject to paragraph (3), an individual shall, if and while entitled to an annuity under subsection (a), (b), (d), or (e) of section 8412, or under section 8414(c), also be entitled to an annuity supplement under this section.
<br>
<br>(2) Subject to paragraph (3), an individual shall, if and while entitled to an annuity under section 8412(f), or under subsection (a) or (b) of section 8414, also be entitled to an annuity supplement under this section if such individual is at least the applicable minimum retirement age under section 8412(h).
<br>
<br>(3)(A) An individual whose entitlement to an annuity under section 8412 or 8414 does not commence before age 62 is not entitled to an annuity supplement under this section.
<br>
<br>(B) An individual entitled to an annuity supplement under this section ceases to be so entitled after the last day of the month preceding the first month for which such individual would, on proper application, be entitled to old-age insurance benefits under title II of the Social Security Act, but not later than the last day of the month in which such individual attains age 62.
<br>
<br>(b)(1) The amount of the annuity supplement of an annuitant under this section for any month shall be equal to the product of—
<br>
<br>(A) an amount determined under paragraph (2), multiplied by
<br>
<br>(B) a fraction, as described in paragraph (3).
<br>
<br>(2) The amount under this paragraph for an annuitant is an amount equal to the old-age insurance benefit which would be payable to such annuitant under title II of the Social Security Act (without regard to sections 203, 215(a)(7), and 215(d)(5) of such Act) upon attaining age 62 and filing application therefor, determined as if the annuitant had attained such age and filed application therefor, and were a fully insured individual (as defined in section 214(a) of such Act), on January 1 of the year in which such annuitant's entitlement to any payment under this section commences, except that the reduction of such old-age insurance benefit under section 202(q) of such Act shall be the maximum applicable for an individual born in the same year as the annuitant. In computing the primary insurance amount under section 215 of such Act for purposes of this paragraph, the number of elapsed years (referred to in section 215(b)(2)(B)(iii) of such Act and used to compute the number of benefit computation years) shall not include years beginning with the year in which such annuitant's entitlement to any payment under this section commences, and—
<br>
<br>(A) only basic pay for service performed (if any) shall be taken into account in computing the total wages and self-employment income of the annuitant for a benefit computation year;
<br>
<br>(B) for a benefit computation year which commences after the date of the separation with respect to which entitlement to the annuitant's annuity under this subchapter is based and before the date as of which such annuitant is treated, under the preceding sentence, to have attained age 62, the total wages and self-employment income of such annuitant for such year shall be deemed to be zero; and
<br>
<br>(C) for a benefit computation year after age 21 which precedes the separation referred to in subparagraph (B), and during which the individual did not perform a full year of service, the total wages and self-employment income of such annuitant for such year shall be deemed to have been an amount equal to the product of—
<br>
<br>(i) the average total wages of all workers for that year, multiplied by
<br>
<br>(ii) a fraction—
<br>
<br>(I) the numerator of which is the total basic pay of the individual for service performed in the first year thereafter in which such individual performed a full year of service; and
<br>
<br>(II) the denominator of which is the average total wages of all workers for the year referred to in subclause (I).
<br>
<br>(3) The fraction under this paragraph for any annuitant is a fraction—
<br>
<br>(A) the numerator of which is the annuitant's total years of service (rounding a fraction to the nearest whole number, with ½ being rounded to the next higher number), not to exceed the number under subparagraph (B); and
<br>
<br>(B) the denominator of which is 40.
<br>
<br>(4) For the purpose of this subsection—
<br>
<br>(A) the term "benefit computation year" has the meaning provided in section 215(b)(2)(B)(i) of the Social Security Act;
<br>
<br>(B) the term "average total wages of all workers", for a year, means the average of the total wages, as defined and computed under section 215(b)(3)(A)(ii)(I) of the Social Security Act for such year; and
<br>
<br>(C) the term "service" does not include military service.
<br>
<br>(c) An amount under this section shall, for purposes of section 8467, be treated in the same way as an amount computed under section 8415.

<br>
<br>(1)(A) There shall be charged to each month of a year under subsection (a) an amount equal to the individual's excess earnings (as determined under paragraph (2) with respect to such year), divided by the number of the individual's supplement entitlement months for such year (as determined under paragraph (3)).

<br>(ii) any earnings attributable to a period before attaining the applicable retirement age under section 8412(h) shall not be considered in determining the excess earnings of an individual who retires under section 8412(d) or (e), or section 8414(c).
