<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>A Bureau-funded school may be closed or consolidated, or the programs of a Bureau-funded school may be substantially curtailed, by reason of facility conditions that constitute an immediate hazard to health and safety only if a health and safety officer of the Bureau and an individual designated at the beginning of the school year by the tribe involved under subparagraph (B) determine that such conditions exist at a facility of the Bureau-funded school.
<br>(B) Designation of individual by tribe
<br>
<br>To be designated by a tribe for purposes of subparagraph (A), an individual shall—
<br>
<br>(i) be a licensed or certified facilities safety inspector;
<br>
<br>(ii) have demonstrated experience in the inspection of facilities for health and safety purposes with respect to occupancy; or
<br>
<br>(iii) have a significant educational background in the health and safety of facilities with respect to occupancy.
<br>(C) Inspection
<br>
<br>After making a determination described in subparagraph (A), the Bureau health and safety officer and the individual designated by the tribe shall conduct an inspection of the conditions of such facility in order to determine whether conditions at such facility constitute an immediate hazard to health and safety. Such inspection shall be completed as expeditiously as practicable, but not later than 20 days after the date on which the action described in subparagraph (A) is taken.
<br>(D) Failure to concur
<br>
<br>If the Bureau health and safety officer, and the individual designated by the tribe, conducting the inspection of a facility required under subparagraph (C) do not concur that conditions at the facility constitute an immediate hazard to health and safety, such officer and individual shall immediately notify the tribal governing body and provide written information related to their determinations.
<br>(E) Consideration by tribal governing body
<br>
<br>Not later than 10 days after a tribal governing body receives notice under subparagraph (D), the tribal governing body shall consider all information relating to the determinations of the Bureau health and safety officer and the individual designated by the tribe and make a determination regarding the closure, consolidation, or curtailment involved.
<br>(F) Agreement to close, consolidate, or curtail
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>If the Bureau health and safety officer and the individual designated by the tribe conducting the inspection of a facility required under subparagraph (C), concur that conditions at the facility constitute an immediate hazard to health and safety, or if the tribal governing body makes such a determination under subparagraph (E), the facility involved shall be closed immediately.
<br>(ii) Reopening of facility if no immediate hazard found to exist
<br>
<br>If the Bureau health and safety officer or the individual designated by the tribe conducting the inspection of a facility required under subparagraph (C) determines that conditions at the facility do not constitute an immediate hazard to health and safety, any consolidation or curtailment that was made under this paragraph shall immediately cease and any school closed by reason of conditions at the facility shall be reopened immediately.
<br>(G) General closure report
<br>
<br>If a Bureau-funded school is temporarily closed or consolidated or the programs of a Bureau-funded school are temporarily substantially curtailed under this subsection and the Secretary determines that the closure, consolidation, or curtailment will exceed 1 year, the Secretary shall submit to the appropriate committees of Congress, the affected tribe, and the local school board, not later than 90 days after the date on which the closure, consolidation, or curtailment was initiated, a report that specifies—
<br>
<br>(i) the reasons for such temporary action;
<br>
<br>(ii) the actions the Secretary is taking to eliminate the conditions that constitute the hazard;
<br>
<br>(iii) an estimated date by which the actions described in clause (ii) will be concluded; and

<br>(2) Nonapplication of certain standards for temporary facility use
<br>(A) Classroom activities
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall permit the local school board to temporarily utilize facilities adjacent to the school, or satellite facilities, if such facilities are suitable for conducting classroom activities. In permitting the use of facilities under the preceding sentence, the Secretary may waive applicable minor standards under section 2001 of this title relating to such facilities (such as the required number of exit lights or configuration of restrooms) so long as such waivers do not result in the creation of an environment that constitutes an immediate and substantial threat to the health, safety, and life of students and staff.
<br>(B) Administrative activities
<br>
<br>The provisions of subparagraph (A) shall apply with respect to administrative personnel if the facilities involved are suitable for activities performed by such personnel.

<br>
<br>(i) with respect to a school that is to be closed for not more than 1 year, 3 months or less; and

<br>(ii) with respect to a school that is to be closed for not less than 1 year, a time period determined appropriate by the Bureau.
<br>(3) Treatment of closure
<br>
<br>Any closure of a Bureau-funded school under this subsection for a period that exceeds 30 days but is less than 1 year, shall be treated by the Bureau as an emergency facility improvement and repair project.
<br>(4) Use of funds
<br>
<br>With respect to a Bureau-funded school that is closed under this subsection, the tribal governing body, or the designated local school board of each Bureau-funded school, involved may authorize the use of funds allocated pursuant to section 2007 of this title, to abate the hazardous conditions without further action by Congress.
<br>(f) Funding requirement
<br>(1) Distribution of funds
<br>
<br>Beginning with the first fiscal year following January 8, 2002, all funds appropriated to the budget accounts for the operations and maintenance of Bureau-funded schools shall be distributed by formula to the schools. No funds from these accounts may be retained or segregated by the Bureau to pay for administrative or other costs of any facilities branch or office, at any level of the Bureau.
<br>(2) Requirements for certain uses
<br>
<br>No funds shall be withheld from the distribution to the budget of any school operated under contract or grant by the Bureau for maintenance or any other facilities or road-related purpose, unless such school has consented, as a modification to the contract or in writing for grants schools, to the withholding of such funds, including the amount thereof, the purpose for which the funds will be used, and the timeline for the services to be provided. The school may, at the end of any fiscal year, cancel an agreement under this paragraph upon giving the Bureau 30 days notice of its intent to do so.
<br>(g) No reduction in Federal funding
<br>

<br>
<br>(D) Uses a weighted unit of 2.0 for each eligible Indian student that—
<br>
<br>(i) is gifted and talented; and
<br>
<br>(ii) is enrolled in the school on a full-time basis,
<br>
<br>in considering the number of eligible Indian students served by the school.
<br>

<br>
<br>for school board activities for such school, including (notwithstanding any other provision of law) meeting expenses and the cost of membership in, and support of, organizations engaged in activities on behalf of Indian education.
<br>(B) Training
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>Each local school board, and any agency school board that serves as a local school board for any grant or contract school, shall ensure that each individual who is a new member of the school board receives, within 1 year after the individual becomes a member of the school board, 40 hours of training relevant to that individual's service on the board.

<br>§2008. Administrative cost grants
<br>(a) Definitions
<br>
<br>In this section:
<br>(1) Administrative cost
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The term "administrative cost" means the cost of necessary administrative functions which—
<br>
<br>(i) the tribe or tribal organization incurs as a result of operating a tribal elementary or secondary educational program;
<br>
<br>(ii) are not customarily paid by comparable Bureau-operated programs out of direct program funds; and
<br>
<br>(iii) are either—
<br>
<br>(I) normally provided for comparable Bureau programs by Federal officials using resources other than Bureau direct program funds; or
<br>
<br>(II) are otherwise required of tribal self-determination program operators by law or prudent management practice.
<br>(B) Inclusions
<br>
<br>The term "administrative cost" may include—
<br>
<br>(i) contract or grant (or other agreement) administration;
<br>
<br>(ii) executive, policy, and corporate leadership and decisionmaking;
<br>
<br>(iii) program planning, development, and management;
<br>
<br>(iv) fiscal, personnel, property, and procurement management;
<br>
<br>(v) related office services and record keeping; and
<br>
<br>(vi) costs of necessary insurance, auditing, legal, safety and security services.
<br>(2) Bureau elementary and secondary functions
<br>
<br>The term "Bureau elementary and secondary functions" means—
<br>
<br>(A) all functions funded at Bureau schools by the Office;
<br>
<br>(B) all programs—
<br>
<br>(i) funds for which are appropriated to other agencies of the Federal Government; and
<br>
<br>(ii) which are administered for the benefit of Indians through Bureau schools; and
<br>
<br>(C) all operation, maintenance, and repair funds for facilities and Government quarters used in the operation or support of elementary and secondary education functions for the benefit of Indians, from whatever source derived.
<br>(3) Direct cost base
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (B), the direct cost base of a tribe or tribal organization for the fiscal year is the aggregate direct cost program funding for all tribal elementary or secondary educational programs operated by the tribe or tribal organization during—
<br>
<br>(i) the second fiscal year preceding such fiscal year; or
<br>
<br>(ii) if such programs have not been operated by the tribe or tribal organization during the 2 preceding fiscal years, the first fiscal year preceding such fiscal year.
<br>(B) Functions not previously operated
<br>
<br>In the case of Bureau elementary or secondary education functions which have not previously been operated by a tribe or tribal organization under contract, grant, or agreement with the Bureau, the direct cost base for the initial year shall be the projected aggregate direct cost program funding for all Bureau elementary and secondary functions to be operated by the tribe or tribal organization during that fiscal year.
<br>(4) Maximum base rate
<br>
<br>The term "maximum base rate" means 50 percent.
<br>(5) Minimum base rate
<br>
<br>The term "minimum base rate" means 11 percent.
<br>(6) Standard direct cost base
<br>
<br>The term "standard direct cost base" means $600,000.
<br>(7) Tribal elementary or secondary educational programs
<br>
<br>The term "tribal elementary or secondary educational programs" means all Bureau elementary and secondary functions, together with any other Bureau programs or portions of programs (excluding funds for social services that are appropriated to agencies other than the Bureau and are funded through the Bureau, funds for major subcontracts, construction, and other major capital expenditures, and unexpended funds carried over from prior years) which share common administrative cost functions, that are operated directly by a tribe or tribal organization under a contract, grant, or agreement with the Bureau.
<br>(b) Grants; effect upon appropriated amounts
<br>(1) Grants
<br>
<br>Subject to the availability of funds, the Secretary shall provide grants to each tribe or tribal organization operating a contract school or grant school in the amount determined under this section with respect to the tribe or tribal organization for the purpose of paying the administrative and indirect costs incurred in operating contract or grant schools, provided that no school operated as a stand-alone institution shall receive less than $200,000 per year for these purposes, in order to—
<br>
<br>(A) enable tribes and tribal organizations operating such schools, without reducing direct program services to the beneficiaries of the program, to provide all related administrative overhead services and operations necessary to meet the requirements of law and prudent management practice; and
<br>
<br>(B) carry out other necessary support functions which would otherwise be provided by the Secretary or other Federal officers or employees, from resources other than direct program funds, in support of comparable Bureau-operated programs.
<br>(2) Effect upon appropriated amounts
<br>
<br>Amounts appropriated to fund the grants provided under this section shall be in addition to, and shall not reduce, the amounts appropriated for the program being administered by the contract or grant school.
<br>(c) Determination of grant amount
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The amount of the grant provided to each tribe or tribal organization under this section for each fiscal year shall be determined by applying the administrative cost percentage rate of the tribe or tribal organization to the aggregate of the Bureau elementary and secondary functions operated by the tribe or tribal organization for which funds are received from or through the Bureau.
<br>(2) Direct cost base funds
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall—
<br>
<br>(A) reduce the amount of the grant determined under paragraph (1) to the extent that payments for administrative costs are actually received by an Indian tribe or tribal organization under any Federal education program included in the direct cost base of the tribe or tribal organization; and
<br>
<br>(B) take such actions as may be necessary to be reimbursed by any other department or agency of the Federal Government for the portion of grants made under this section for the costs of administering any program for Indians that is funded by appropriations made to such other department or agency.
<br>(d) Administrative cost percentage rate
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, the administrative cost percentage rate for a contract or grant school for a fiscal year is equal to the percentage determined by dividing—
<br>
<br>(A) the sum of—
<br>
<br>(i) the amount equal to—
<br>
<br>(I) the direct cost base of the tribe or tribal organization for the fiscal year, multiplied by
<br>
<br>(II) the minimum base rate; plus
<br>
<br>(ii) the amount equal to—
<br>
<br>(I) the standard direct cost base; multiplied by
<br>
<br>(II) the maximum base rate; by
<br>
<br>(B) the sum of—
<br>
<br>(i) the direct cost base of the tribe or tribal organization for the fiscal year; plus
<br>
<br>(ii) the standard direct cost base.
<br>(2) Rounding
<br>
<br>The administrative cost percentage rate shall be determined to the 1/100 of a decimal point.
<br>(3) Applicability
<br>
<br>The administrative cost percentage rate determined under this subsection shall not apply to other programs operated by the tribe or tribal organization.
<br>(e) Combining funds
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Funds received by a tribe or contract or grant school as grants under this section for tribal elementary or secondary educational programs may be combined by the tribe or contract or grant school into a single administrative cost account without the necessity of maintaining separate funding source accounting.
<br>(2) Indirect cost funds
<br>
<br>Indirect cost funds for programs at the school which share common administrative services with tribal elementary or secondary educational programs may be included in the administrative cost account described in paragraph (1).
<br>(f) Availability of funds
<br>
<br>Funds received as grants under this section with respect to tribal elementary or secondary education programs shall remain available to the contract or grant school without fiscal year limitation and without diminishing the amount of any grants otherwise payable to the school under this section for any fiscal year beginning after the fiscal year for which the grant is provided.
<br>(g) Treatment of funds
<br>
<br>Funds received as grants under this section for Bureau-funded programs operated by a tribe or tribal organization under a contract or agreement shall not be taken into consideration for purposes of indirect cost underrecovery and overrecovery determinations by any Federal agency for any other funds, from whatever source derived.
<br>(h) Treatment of entity operating other programs
<br>
<br>In applying this section and section 106 of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act [25 U.S.C. 5325] with respect to an Indian tribe or tribal organization that—
<br>
<br>(1) receives funds under this section for administrative costs incurred in operating a contract or grant school or a school operated under the Tribally Controlled Schools Act of 1988 [25 U.S.C. 2501 et seq.]; and
<br>
<br>(2) operates one or more other programs under a contract or grant provided under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act [25 U.S.C. 5301 et seq.],
<br>
<br>the Secretary shall ensure that the Indian tribe or tribal organization is provided with the full amount of the administrative costs that are associated with operating the contract or grant school, and of the indirect costs, that are associated with all of such other programs, except that funds appropriated for implementation of this section shall be used only to supply the amount of the grant required to be provided by this section.
<br>(i) Studies for determination of factors affecting costs; base rates limits; standard direct cost base; report to Congress
<br>(1) Studies
<br>
<br>Not later than 120 days after January 8, 2002, the Director of the Office of Indian Education Programs shall—
<br>
<br>(A) conduct such studies as may be needed to establish an empirical basis for determining relevant factors substantially affecting required administrative costs of tribal elementary and secondary education programs, using the formula set forth in subsection (c); and
<br>
<br>(B) conduct a study to determine—
<br>
<br>(i) a maximum base rate which ensures that the amount of the grants provided under this section will provide adequate (but not excessive) funding of the administrative costs of the smallest tribal elementary or secondary educational programs;
<br>
<br>(ii) a minimum base rate which ensures that the amount of the grants provided under this section will provide adequate (but not excessive) funding of the administrative costs of the largest tribal elementary or secondary educational programs; and
<br>
<br>(iii) a standard direct cost base which is the aggregate direct cost funding level for which the percentage determined under subsection (d) will—
<br>
<br>(I) be equal to the median between the maximum base rate and the minimum base rate; and
<br>
<br>(II) ensure that the amount of the grants provided under this section will provide adequate (but not excessive) funding of the administrative costs of tribal elementary or secondary educational programs closest to the size of the program.
<br>(2) Guidelines
<br>
<br>The studies required under paragraph (1) shall—
<br>
<br>(A) be conducted in full consultation (in accordance with section 2011 of this title) with—
<br>
<br>(i) the tribes and tribal organizations that are affected by the application of the formula set forth in subsection (c); and
<br>
<br>(ii) all national and regional Indian organizations of which such tribes and tribal organizations are typically members;
<br>
<br>(B) be conducted onsite with a representative statistical sample of the tribal elementary or secondary educational programs under a contract entered into with a nationally reputable public accounting and business consulting firm;
<br>
<br>(C) take into account the availability of skilled labor commodities, business and automatic data processing services, related Indian preference and Indian control of education requirements, and any other market factors found to substantially affect the administrative costs and efficiency of each such tribal elementary or secondary educational program studied in order to ensure that all required administrative activities can reasonably be delivered in a cost effective manner for each such program, given an administrative cost allowance generated by the values, percentages, or other factors found in the studies to be relevant in such formula;
<br>
<br>(D) identify, and quantify in terms of percentages of direct program costs, any general factors arising from geographic isolation, or numbers of programs administered, independent of program size factors used to compute a base administrative cost percentage in such formula; and
<br>
<br>(E) identify any other incremental cost factors substantially affecting the costs of required administrative cost functions at any of the tribal elementary or secondary educational programs studied and determine whether the factors are of general applicability to other such programs, and (if so) how the factors may effectively be incorporated into such formula.
<br>(3) Consultation with Inspector General
<br>
<br>In carrying out the studies required under this subsection, the Director shall obtain the input of, and afford an opportunity to participate to, the Inspector General of the Department of the Interior.
<br>(4) Consideration of delivery of administrative services
<br>
<br>Determinations described in paragraph (2)(C) shall be based on what is practicable at each location studied, given prudent management practice, irrespective of whether required administrative services were actually or fully delivered at these sites, or whether other services were delivered instead, during the period of the study.
<br>(5) Report
<br>
<br>Upon completion of the studies conducted under paragraph (1), the Director shall submit to Congress a report on the findings of the studies, together with determinations based upon such studies that would affect the definitions set forth under subsection (e) that are used in the formula set forth in subsection (c).
<br>(6) Projection of costs
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall include in the Bureau's justification for each appropriations request beginning in the first fiscal year after the completion of the studies conducted under paragraph (1), a projection of the overall costs associated with the formula set forth in subsection (c) for all tribal elementary or secondary education programs which the Secretary expects to be funded in the fiscal year for which the appropriations are sought.
<br>(7) Determination of program size
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subsection, the size of tribal elementary or secondary educational programs is determined by the aggregate direct cost program funding level for all Bureau-funded programs which share common administrative cost functions.
<br>(j) Authorization of appropriations
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section such sums as may be necessary.
<br>(2) Reductions
<br>
<br>If the total amount of funds necessary to provide grants to tribes and tribal organizations in the amounts determined under subsection (c) for a fiscal year exceeds the amount of funds appropriated to carry out this section for such fiscal year, the Secretary shall reduce the amount of each grant determined under subsection (c) for such fiscal year by an amount that bears the same relationship to such excess as the amount of such grants determined under subsection (c) bears to the total of all grants determined under subsection (c) section 1 for all tribes and tribal organizations for such fiscal year.
<br>(k) Applicability to schools operating under Tribally Controlled Schools Act of 1988
<br>
<br>The provisions of this section shall apply to schools operating under the Tribally Controlled Schools Act of 1988 [25 U.S.C. 2501 et seq.].
<br>(l) Administrative cost grant budget requests
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Beginning with President's 2 annual budget request under section 1105 of title 31 for fiscal year 2002, and with respect to each succeeding budget request, at the discretion of the Secretary, the Secretary shall submit to the appropriate committees of Congress information and funding requests for the full funding of administrative costs grants required to be paid under this section.
<br>(2) Requirements
<br>(A) Funding for new conversions to contract or grant school operations
<br>
<br>With respect to a budget request under paragraph (1), the amount required to provide full funding for an administrative cost grant for each tribe or tribal organization expected to begin operation of a Bureau-funded school as contract or grant school in the academic year funded by such annual budget request, the amount so required shall not be less than 10 percent of the amount required for subparagraph (B).
<br>(B) Funding for continuing contract and grant school operations
<br>
<br>With respect to a budget request under paragraph (1), the amount required to provide full funding for an administrative cost grant for each tribe or tribal organization operating a contract or grant school at the time the annual budget request is submitted, which amount shall include the amount of funds required to provide full funding for an administrative cost grant for each tribe or tribal organization which began operation of a contract or grant school with administrative cost grant funds supplied from the amount described in subparagraph (A).
