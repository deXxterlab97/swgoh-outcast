<br>So it was always: by day the cloud covered it, and by night as it were the appearance of fire. 17 And when the cloud that covered the taber- nacle was taken up, then the children of Israel marched forward: and in the place where the
<br>cloud stood still, there they camped.
<br>At the commandment of the Lord they marched, and at his commandment they pitched the tabernacle. All the days that the cloud abode over the tabernacle, they remained in the same place:
<br>And if it was so that it continued over it a long time, the children of Israel kept the watches of the Lord, and marched not,
<br>For as many days soever as the cloud stayed
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>over the tabernacle. At the commandment of the Lord they pitched their tents, and at his com- mandment they took them down.
<br>If the cloud tarried from evening until morning, and immediately at break of day left the tabernacle, they marched forward: and if it departed after a day and a night, they took down their tents.
<br>But if it remained over the tabernacle for two days or a month or a longer time, the chil- dren of Israel remained in the same place, and marched not: but immediately as soon as it de- parted, they removed the camp.
<br>By the word of the Lord they pitched their tents, and by his word they marched: and kept the watches of the Lord according to his com- mandment by the hand of Moses.
<br>
<br>Chapter 10
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>Make thee two trumpets of beaten silver, wherewith thou mayest call together the multi- tude when the camp is to be removed.
<br>And when thou shalt sound the trumpets, all the multitude shall gather unto thee to the door of the tabernacle of the covenant.
<br>If thou sound but once, the princes and the heads of the multitude of Israel shall come to thee.
<br>But if the sound of the trumpets be longer, and with interruptions, they that are on the east side, shall first go forward.
<br>And at the second sounding and like noise of the trumpet, they who lie on the south side shall take up their tents. And after this manner shall the rest do, when the trumpets shall sound for a march.
<br>But when the people is to be gathered to-
<br> 
<br>gether, the sound of the trumpets shall be plain, and they shall not make a broken sound.
<br>And the sons of Aaron the priest shall sound the trumpets: and this shall be an ordinance for ever in your generations.
<br>If you go forth to war out of your land against the enemies that fight against you, you shall sound aloud with the trumpets, and there shall be a remembrance of you before the Lord your God, that you may be delivered out of the hands of your enemies.
<br>If at any time you shall have a banquet, and on your festival days, and on the first days of your months, you shall sound the trumpets over the holocausts, and the sacrifices of peace offerings, that they may be to you for a remem- brance of your God. I am the Lord your God.
<br>The second year, in the second month, the twentieth day of the month, the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle of the covenant.
<br>And the children of Israel marched by their troops from the desert of Sinai, and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Pharan.
<br>And the first went forward according to the commandment of the Lord by the hand of Moses. 14 The sons of Juda by their troops: whose
<br>prince was Nahasson the son of Aminadab.
<br>In the tribe of the sons of Issachar, the prince was Nathanael the son of Suar.
<br>In the tribe of Zabulon, the prince was Eliab the son of Helon.
<br>And the tabernacle was taken down, and the sons of Gerson and Merari set forward, bear- ing it.
<br>And the sons of Ruben also marched, by their troops and ranks, whose prince was Helisur the son of Sedeur.
<br>And in the tribe of Simeon, the prince was Salamiel the son of Surisaddai.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>And in the tribe of Gad, the prince was Eliasaph the son of Duel.
<br>Then the Caathites also marched carrying the sanctuary. So long was the tabernacle car- ried, till they came to the place of setting it up.
<br>The sons of Ephraim also moved their camp by their troops, in whose army the prince was Elisama the son of Ammiud.
<br>And in the tribe of the sons of Manasses, the prince was Gamaliel the son of Phadassur.
<br>And in the tribe of Benjamin, the prince was Abidan the son of Gedeon.
<br>The last of all the camp marched the sons of Dan by their troops, in whose army the prince was Ahiezer the son of Ammisaddai.
<br>And in the tribe of the sons of Aser, the prince was Phegiel the son of Ochran.
<br>And in the tribe of the sons of Nephtali, the prince was Ahira the son of Enan.
<br>This was the order of the camps, and marches of the children of Israel by their troops, when they set forward.
<br>And Moses said to Hobab the son of Raguel the Madianite, his kinsman: We are going to- wards the place which the Lord will give us: come with us, that we may do thee good: for the Lord hath promised good things to Israel.
<br>But he answered him: I will not go with thee, but I will return to my country, wherein I was born.
<br>And he said: Do not leave us: for thou knowest in what places we should encamp in the wilderness, and thou shalt be our guide.
<br>And if thou comest with us, we will give thee what is the best of the riches which the Lord shall deliver to us.
<br>So they marched from the mount of the Lord three daysâ€™ journey, and the ark of the covenant of the Lord went before them, for three days providing a place for the camp.
<br> 
<br>The cloud also of the Lord was over them by day when they marched.
<br>And when the ark was lifted up, Moses said: Arise, O Lord, and let thy enemies be scat- tered, and let them that hate thee, flee from be- fore thy face.
<br>And when it was set down, he said: Return, O Lord, to the multitude of the host of Israel.
<br>
<br>Chapter 11
<br>In the mean time there arose a murmuring of the people against the Lord, as it were repining at their fatigue. And when the Lord heard it he was angry. And the fire of the Lord being kindled against them, devoured them that were at the uttermost part of the camp.
<br>And when the people cried to Moses, Moses prayed to the Lord, and the fire was swallowed up.
<br>And he called the name of that place, The burning: for that the fire of the Lord had been kindled against them.
<br>For a mixt multitude of people, that came up with them, burned with desire, sitting and weeping, the children of Israel also being joined with them, and said: Who shall give us flesh to eat?
<br>We remember the fish that we ate in Egypt free cost: the cucumbers come into our mind, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic.
<br>Our soul is dry, our eyes behold nothing else but manna.
<br>Now the manna was like coriander seed, of the colour of bdellium.
<br>And the people went about, and gathering it, ground it in a mill, or beat it in a mortar, and boiled it in a pot, and made cakes thereof of the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>taste of bread tempered with oil.
<br>And when the dew fell in the night upon the camp, the manna also fell with it.
<br>Now Moses heard the people weeping by their families, every one at the door of his tent. And the wrath of the Lord was exceedingly enkindled: to Moses also the thing seemed in- supportable.
<br>And he said to the Lord: Why hast thou afflicted thy servant? Wherefore do I not find favour before thee? And why hast thou laid the weight of all this people upon me?
<br>Have I conceived all this multitude, or begotten them, that thou shouldst say to me: Carry them in thy bosom as the nurse is wont to carry the little infant, and bear them into the land, for which thou hast sworn to their fathers? 13 Whence should I have flesh to give to so great a multitude? They weep against me, say-
<br>ing: Give us flesh that we may eat.
<br>I am not able alone to bear all this people, because it is too heavy for me.
<br>But if it seem unto thee otherwise, I be- seech thee to kill me, and let me find grace in thy eyes, that I be not afflicted with so great evils.
<br>And the Lord said to Moses: Gather unto me seventy men of the ancients of Israel, whom thou knowest to be ancients and masters of the people: and thou shalt bring them to the door of the tabernacle of the covenant, and shalt make them stand there with thee,
<br>That I may come down and speak with thee: and I will take of thy spirit, and will give to them, that they may bear with thee the burden of the people, and thou mayest not be burthened alone.
<br>And thou shalt say to the people: Be ye sanctified: to morrow you shall eat flesh: for I have heard you say: Who will give us flesh to
<br> 
<br>eat? It was well with us in Egypt. That the Lord may give you flesh, and you may eat:
<br>Not for one day, nor two, nor five, nor ten, no nor for twenty.
<br>But even for a month of days, till it come out at your nostrils, and become loathsome to you, because you have cast off the Lord, who is in the midst of you, and have wept before him, saying: Why came we out of Egypt?
<br>And Moses said: There are six hundred thousand footmen of this people, and sayest thou: I will give them flesh to eat a whole month?
<br>Shall then a multitude of sheep and oxen be killed, that it may suffice for their food? or shall the fishes of the sea be gathered together to fill them?
<br>And the Lord answered him: Is the hand of the Lord unable? Thou shalt presently see whether my word shall come to pass or no.
<br>Moses therefore came, and told the people the words of the Lord, and assembled seventy men of the ancients of Israel, and made them to stand about the tabernacle.
<br>And the Lord came down in a cloud, and spoke to him, taking away of the spirit that was in Moses, and giving to the seventy men. And when the spirit had rested on them they proph- esied, nor did they cease afterwards.
<br>Now there remained in the camp two of the men, of whom one was called Eldad, and the other Medad, upon whom the spirit rested; for they also had been enrolled, but were not gone forth to the tabernacle.
<br>And when they prophesied in the camp, there ran a young man, and told Moses, saying: Eldad and Medad prophesy in the camp.
<br>Forthwith Josue the son of Nun, the minis- ter of Moses, and chosen out of many, said: My lord Moses forbid them.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>But he said: Why hast thou emulation for me? O that all the people might prophesy, and that the Lord would give them his spirit!
<br>And Moses returned, with the ancients of Israel, into the camp.
<br>And a wind going out from the Lord, taking quails up beyond the sea brought them, and cast them into the camp for the space of one dayâ€™s journey, on every side of the camp round about, and they flew in the air two cubits high above the ground.
<br>The people therefore rising up all that day, and night, and the next day, gathered together of quails, he that did least, ten cores: and they dried them round about the camp.
<br>As yet the flesh was between their teeth, neither had that kind of meat failed: when behold the wrath of the Lord being provoked against the people, struck them with an exceed- ing great plague.
<br>And that place was called, The graves of lust: for there they buried the people that had lusted. And departing from the graves of lust, they came unto Haseroth, and abode there.
<br>
<br>Chapter 12
<br>And Mary and Aaron spoke against Moses, be- cause of his wife the Ethiopian,
<br>And they said: Hath the Lord spoken by Moses only?   Hath he not also spoken to us in like manner? And when the Lord heard this,
<br>(For Moses was a man exceeding meek above all men that dwelt upon earth)
<br>Immediately he spoke to him, and to Aaron and Mary: Come out you three only to the taber- nacle of the covenant. And when they were come out,
<br>The Lord came down in a pillar of the cloud,
<br> 
<br>and stood in the entry of the tabernacle calling to Aaron and Mary. And when they were come,
<br>He said to them: Hear my words: if there be among you a prophet of the Lord, I will appear to him in a vision, or I will speak to him in a dream.
<br>But it is not so with my servant Moses who is most faithful in all my house:
<br>For I speak to him mouth to mouth: and plainly, and not by riddles and figures doth he see the Lord. Why then were you not afraid to speak ill of my servant Moses?
<br>And being angry with them he went away:
<br>The cloud also that was over the taberna- cle departed: and behold Mary appeared white as snow with a leprosy. And when Aaron had looked on her, and saw her all covered with lep- rosy,
<br>He said to Moses: I beseech thee, my lord, lay not upon us this sin, which we have foolishly committed:
<br>Let her not be as one dead, and as an abortive that is cast forth from the motherâ€™s womb. Lo, now one half of her flesh is consumed with the leprosy.
<br>And Moses cried to the Lord, saying O God, I beseech thee heal her.
<br>And the Lord answered him: If her father had spitten upon her face, ought she not to have been ashamed for seven days at least? Let her be separated seven days without the camp, and afterwards she shall be called again.
<br>Mary therefore was put out of the camp seven days: and the people moved not from that place until Mary was called again.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 13
<br>And the people marched from Haseroth, and pitched their tents in the desert of Pharan.
<br>And there the Lord spoke to Moses, saying.
<br>Send men to view the land of Chanaan, which I will give to the children of Israel, one of every tribe, of the rulers.
<br>Moses did what the Lord had commanded, sending from the desert of Pharan, principal men, whose names are these:
<br>Of the tribe of Ruben, Sammua the son of Zechur.
<br>Of the tribe of Simeon, Saphat the son of Huri.
<br>Of the tribe of Juda, Caleb the son of Je- phone.
<br>Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.
<br>Of the tribe of Ephraim, Osee the son of Nun.
<br>Of the tribe of Benjamin, Phalti the son of Raphu.
<br>Of the tribe of Zabulon, Geddiel the son of Sodi.
<br>Of the tribe of Joseph, of the sceptre of Manasses, Gaddi the son of Susi.
<br>Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.
<br>Of the tribe of Aser, Sthur the son of Michael.
<br>Of the tribe of Nephtali, Nahabi the son of Vapsi.
<br>Of the tribe of Gad, Guel the son of Machi. 17 These are the  names of the  men, whom Moses sent to view the land: and he called Osee
<br>the son of Nun, Josue.
<br>And Moses sent them to view the land of Chanaan, and said to them: Go you up by the
<br> 
<br>south side. And when you shall come to the mountains,
<br>View the land, of what sort it is, and the people that are the inhabitants thereof, whether they be strong or weak: few in number or many: 20 The land itself, whether it be good or bad:
<br>what manner of cities, walled or without walls:
<br>The ground, fat or barren, woody or with- out trees. Be of good courage, and bring us of the fruits of the land. Now it was the time when the firstripe grapes are fit to be eaten.
<br>And when they were gone up, they viewed the land from the desert of Sin, unto Rohob as you enter into Emath.
<br>And they went up at the south side, and came to Hebron, where were Achiman and Sisai and Tholmai the sons of Enac. For Hebron was built seven years before Tanis the city of Egypt. 24 And forward as far as the torrent of the cluster of grapes, they cut off a branch with its cluster of grapes, which two men carried upon a lever. They took also of the pomegranates and
<br>of the figs of that place:
<br>Which was called Nehelescol, that is to say, the torrent of the cluster of grapes, because from thence the children of Israel had carried a cluster of grapes.
<br>And they that went to spy out the land returned after forty days, having gone round all the country,
<br>And came to Moses and Aaron and to all the assembly of the children of Israel to the desert of Pharan, which is in Cades. And speak- ing to them and to all the multitude, they shewed them the fruits of the land:
<br>And they related and said: We came into the land to which thou sentest us, which in very deed floweth with milk and honey as may be known by these fruits:
<br>But it hath very strong inhabitants, and
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>the cities are great and walled.   We saw there the race of Enac.
<br>Amalec dwelleth in the south, the Hethite and the Jebusite and the Amorrhite in the moun- tains: but the Chanaanite abideth by the sea and near the streams of the Jordan.
<br>In the mean time Caleb, to still the mur- muring of the people that rose against Moses, said: Let us go up and possess the land, for we shall be able to conquer it.
<br>But the others, that had been with him, said: No, we are not able to go up to this people, because they are stronger than we.
<br>And they spoke ill of the land, which they had viewed, before the children of Israel, saying: The land which we have viewed, devoureth its inhabitants: the people, that we beheld are of a tall stature.
<br>There we saw certain monsters of the sons of Enac, of the giant kind: in comparison of whom, we seemed like locusts.
<br>
<br>Chapter 14
<br>Therefore the whole multitude crying wept that night.
<br>And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron, saying:
<br>Would God that we had died in Egypt: and would God we may die in this vast wilderness, and that the Lord may not bring us into this land, lest we fall by the sword, and our wives and children be led away captives. Is it not better to return into Egypt?
<br>And they said one to another: Let us ap- point a captain, and let us return into Egypt.
<br>And when Moses and Aaron heard this, they fell down flat upon the ground before the multi- tude of the children of Israel.
<br> 
<br>But Josue the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephone, who themselves also had viewed the land, rent their garments,
<br>And said to all the multitude of the children of Israel: The land which we have gone round is very good:
<br>If the Lord be favourable, he will bring us into it, and give us a land flowing with milk and honey.
<br>Be not rebellious against the Lord: and fear ye not the people of this land, for we are able to eat them up as bread. All aid is gone from them: the Lord is with us, fear ye not.
<br>And when all the multitude cried out, and would have stoned them, the glory of the Lord appeared over the tabernacle of the covenant to all the children of Israel.
<br>And the Lord said to Moses: How long will this people detract me? how long will they not believe me for all the signs that I have wrought before them?
<br>I will strike them therefore with pestilence, and will consume them: but thee I will make a ruler over a great nation, and a mightier than this is.
<br>And Moses said to the Lord: That the Egyptians, from the midst of whom thou hast brought forth this people,
<br>And the inhabitants of this land, (who have heard that thou, O Lord, art among this people, and art seen face to face, and thy cloud pro- tecteth them, and thou goest before them in a pillar of a cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night,)
<br>15 May hear that thou hast killed so great a multitude as it were one man and may say:
<br>He could not bring the people into the land for which he had sworn, therefore did he kill them in the wilderness.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Let then the strength of the Lord be mag- nified, as thou hast sworn, saying:
<br>The Lord is patient and full of mercy, by taking away iniquity and wickedness, and leaving no man clear, who visitest the sins of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth gen- eration.
<br>Forgive, I beseech thee, the sins of this peo- ple, according to the greatness of thy mercy, as thou hast been merciful to them from their going out of Egypt unto this place.
<br>And the Lord said: I have forgiven accord- ing to thy word.
<br>As I live: and the whole earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord.
<br>But yet all the men that have seen my majesty, and the signs that I have done in Egypt, and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now ten times, and have not obeyed my voice,
<br>Shall not see the land for which I swore to their fathers, neither shall any one of them that hath detracted me behold it.
<br>My servant Caleb, who being full of an- other spirit hath followed me, I will bring into this land which he hath gone round: and his seed shall possess it.
<br>For the Amalecite and the Chanaanite dwell in the valleys. To morrow remove the camp, and return into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:
<br>How long doth this wicked multitude mur- mur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel.
<br>Say therefore to them: As I live, saith the Lord: According as you have spoken in my hear- ing, so will I do to you.
<br>In the wilderness shall your carcasses lie. All you that were numbered from twenty years
<br> 
<br>old and upward, and have murmured against me,
<br>Shall not enter into the land, over which I lifted up my hand to make you dwell therein, except Caleb the son of Jephone, and Josue the son of Nun.
<br>But your children, of whom you said, that they should be a prey to the enemies, will I bring in: that they may see the land which you have despised.
<br>Your carcasses shall lie in the wilderness.
<br>Your children shall wander in the desert forty years, and shall bear your fornication, until the carcasses of their fathers be consumed in the desert,
<br>According to the number of the forty days, wherein you viewed the land: a year shall be counted for a day. And forty years you shall re- ceive your iniquities, and shall know my revenge: 35 For as I have spoken, so will I do to all this wicked multitude, that hath risen up together against me: in this wilderness shall it faint away
<br>and die.
<br>Therefore all the men, whom Moses had sent to view the land, and who at their re- turn had made the whole multitude to murmur against him, speaking ill of the land that it was naught,
<br>Died and were struck in the sight of the Lord.
<br>But Josue the son of Nun, and Caleb had gone to view the land.
<br>And Moses spoke all these words to all the children of Israel, and the people mourned ex- ceedingly.
<br>And behold rising up very early in the morning, they went up to the top of the moun- tain, and said: We are ready to go up to the place, of which the Lord hath spoken: for we have sinned.
<br>And Moses said to them: Why transgress
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>you the word of the Lord, which shall not succeed prosperously with you?
<br>Go not up, for the Lord is not with you: lest you fall before your enemies.
<br>The Amalecite and the Chanaanite are be- fore you, and by their sword you shall fall, be- cause you would not consent to the Lord, neither will the Lord be with you.
<br>But they being blinded went up to the top of the mountain. But the ark of the testament of the Lord and Moses departed not from the camp.
<br>And the Amalecite came down, and the Chanaanite that dwelt in the mountain: and smiting and slaying them pursued them as far as Horma.
<br>
<br>Chapter 15
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>Speak to the children of Israel and thou shalt say to them: When you shall be come unto the land of your habitation, which I will give you,
<br>And shall make an offering to the Lord, for a holocaust, or a victim, paying your vows, or voluntarily offering gifts, or in your solemnities burning a sweet savour unto the Lord, of oxen or of sheep:
<br>Whosoever immolateth the victim, shall of- fer a sacrifice of fine flour, the tenth part of an ephi, tempered with the fourth part of a hin of oil:
<br>And he shall give the same measure of wine to pour out in libations for the holocaust or for the victim. For every lamb,
<br>And for every ram there shall be a sacrifice of flour of two tenths, which shall be tempered with the third part of a hin of oil:
<br>And he shall offer the third part the same
<br> 
<br>measure of wine for the libation, for a sweet savour to the Lord.
<br>But when thou offerest a holocaust or sac- rifice of oxen, to fulfil thy vow or for victims of peace offerings,
<br>Thou shalt give for every ox three tenths of flour tempered with half a hin of oil,
<br>And wine for libations of the same measure, for an offering of most sweet savour to the Lord.
<br>Thus shalt thou do
<br>For every ox and ram and lamb and kid.
<br>Both they that are born in the land, and the strangers
<br>Shall offer sacrifices after the same rite.
<br>There shall be all one law and judgment both for you and for them who are strangers in the land.
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them:
<br>When you are come into the land which I will give you,
<br>And shall eat of the bread of that country, you shall separate firstfruits to the Lord,
<br>Of the things you eat. As you separate firstfruits of your barnfloors:
<br>So also shall you give firstfruits of your dough to the Lord.
<br>And if through ignorance you omit any of these things, which the Lord hath spoken to Moses,
<br>And by him hath commanded you from the day that he began to command and thencefor- ward,
<br>And the multitude have forgotten to do it: they shall offer a calf out of the herd, a holocaust for a most sweet savour to the Lord, and the sacrifice and libations thereof, as the ceremonies require, and a buck goat for sin:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>And the priest shall pray for all the mul- titude of the children of Israel: and it shall be forgiven them, because they sinned ignorantly, offering notwithstanding a burnt offering to the Lord for themselves and for their sin and their Ignorance:
<br>And it shall be forgiven all the people of the children of Israel: and the strangers that sojourn among them: because it is the fault of all the people through ignorance.
<br>But if one soul shall sin ignorantly, he shall offer a she goat of a year old for his sin.
<br>And the priest shall pray for him, because he sinned ignorantly before the Lord: and he shall obtain his pardon, and it shall be forgiven him.
<br>The same law shall be for all that sin by ignorance, whether they be natives or strangers. 30 But the soul that committeth any thing through pride, whether he be born in the land or a stranger (because he hath been rebellious against the Lord) shall be cut off from among
<br>his people:
<br>For he hath contemned the word of the Lord, and made void his precept: therefore shall he be destroyed, and shall bear his iniquity.
<br>And it came to pass, when the children of Israel were in the wilderness, and had found a man gathering sticks on the sabbath day,
<br>That they brought him to Moses and Aaron and the whole multitude.
<br>And they put him into prison, not knowing what they should do with him.
<br>And the Lord said to Moses: Let that man die, let all the multitude stone him without the camp.
<br>And when they had brought him out, they stoned him, and he died as the Lord had com- manded.
<br>The Lord also said to Moses:
<br> 
<br>Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt tell them to make to themselves fringes in the corners of their garments, putting in them ribands of blue:
<br>That when they shall see them, they may remember all the commandments of the Lord, and not follow their own thoughts and eyes going astray after divers things,
<br>But rather being mindful of the precepts of the Lord, may do them and be holy to their God.
<br>I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, that I might be your God.
<br>
<br>Chapter 16
<br>And behold Core the son of Isaar, the son of Caath, the son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiron the sons of Eliab, and Hon the son of Pheleth of the children of Ruben,
<br>Rose up against Moses, and with them two hundred and fifty others of the children of Israel, leading men of the synagogue, and who in the time of assembly were called by name.
<br>And when they had stood up against Moses and Aaron, they said: Let it be enough for you, that all the multitude consisteth of holy ones, and the Lord is among them: Why lift you up yourselves above the people of the Lord?
<br>When Moses heard this, he fell flat on his face:
<br>And speaking to Core and all the multi- tude, he said: In the morning the Lord will make known who belong to him, and the holy he will join to himself: and whom he shall choose, they shall approach to him.
<br>Do this therefore: Take every man of you your censers, thou Core, and all thy company.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>And putting fire in them to morrow, put in- cense upon it before the Lord: and whomsoever he shall choose, the same shall be holy: you take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi.
<br>And he said again to Core: Hear ye sons of Levi.
<br>Is it a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel hath spared you from all the people, and joined you to himself, that you should serve him in the service of the tabernacle, and should stand before the congregation of the people, and should minister to him?
<br>Did he therefore make thee and all thy brethren the sons of Levi to approach unto him, that you should challenge to yourselves the priesthood also,
<br>And that all thy company should stand against the Lord? for what is Aaron that you murmur against him?
<br>Then Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiron the sons of Eliab. But they answered: We will not come.
<br>Is it a small matter to thee, that thou hast brought us out of a land that flowed with milk and honey, to kill us in the desert, except thou rule also like a lord over us?
<br>Thou hast brought us indeed into a land that floweth with rivers of milk and honey, and hast given us possessions of fields and vineyards; wilt thou also pull out our eyes? We will not come.
<br>Moses therefore being very angry, said to the Lord: Respect not their sacrifices: thou knowest that I have not taken of them so much as a young ass at any time, nor have injured any of them.
<br>And he said to Core: Do thou and thy con- gregation stand apart before the Lord to morrow, and Aaron apart.
<br>Take every one of you censers, and put in-
<br> 
<br>cense upon them, offering to the Lord two hun- dred and fifty censers: let Aaron also hold his censer.
<br>When they had done this, Moses and Aaron standing,
<br>And had drawn up all the multitude against them to the door of the tabernacle, the glory of the Lord appeared to them all.
<br>And the Lord speaking to Moses and Aaron, said:
<br>Separate yourselves from among this con- gregation, that I may presently destroy them.
<br>They fell flat on their face, and said: O most mighty, the God of the spirits of all flesh, for one manâ€™s sin shall thy wrath rage against all?
<br>And the Lord said to Moses:
<br>Command the whole people to separate themselves from the tents of Core and Dathan and Abiron.
<br>And Moses arose, and went to Dathan and Abiron: and the ancients of Israel following him, 26 He said to the multitude: Depart from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of
<br>theirs, lest you be involved in their sins.
<br>And when they were departed from their tents round about, Dathan and Abiron coming out stood in the entry of their pavilions with their wives and children, and all the people.
<br>And Moses said: By this you shall know that the Lord hath sent me to do all things that you see, and that I have not forged them of my own head:
<br>If these men die the common death of men, and if they be visited with a plague, wherewith others also are wont to be visited, the Lord did not send me.
<br>But if the Lord do a new thing, and the earth opening her mouth swallow them down, and all things that belong to them, and they go
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>down alive into hell, you shall know that they have blasphemed the Lord.
<br>And immediately as he had made an end of speaking, the earth broke asunder under their feet:
<br>And opening her mouth, devoured them with their tents and all their substance.
<br>And they went down alive into hell, the ground closing upon them, and they perished from among the people.
<br>But all Israel, that was standing round about, fled at the cry of them that were per- ishing: saying: Lest perhaps the earth swallow us up also.
<br>And a fire coming out from the Lord, de- stroyed the two hundred and fifty men that of- fered the incense.
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>Command Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest to take up the censers that lie in the burn- ing, and to scatter the fire of one side and the other: because they are sanctified
<br>In the deaths of the sinners: and let him beat them into plates, and fasten them to the altar, because incense hath been offered in them to the Lord, and they are sanctified, that the children of Israel may see them for a sign and a memorial.
<br>Then Eleazar the priest took the brazen censers, wherein they had offered, whom the burning fire had devoured, and beat them into plates, fastening them to the altar:
<br>That the children of Israel might have for the time to come wherewith they should be ad- monished, that no stranger or any one that is not of the seed of Aaron should come near to offer incense to the Lord, lest he should suffer as Core suffered, and all his congregation, according as the Lord spoke to Moses.
<br>The following day all the multitude of the
<br> 
<br>children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron, saying: You have killed the people of the Lord.
<br>And when there arose a sedition, and the tumult increased,
<br>Moses and Aaron fled to the tabernacle of the covenant. And when they were gone into it, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the Lord appeared.
<br>And the Lord said to Moses:
<br>Get you out from the midst of this multi- tude, this moment will I destroy them. And as they were lying on the ground,
<br>Moses said to Aaron: Take the censer, and putting fire in it from the altar, put incense upon it, and go quickly to the people to pray for them: for already wrath is gone out from the Lord, and the plague rageth.
<br>When Aaron had done this, and had run to the midst of the multitude which the burning fire was now destroying, he offered the incense:
<br>And standing between the dead and the living, he prayed for the people, and the plague ceased.
<br>And the number of them that were slain was fourteen thousand and seven hundred men, besides them that had perished in the sedition of Core.
<br>And Aaron returned to Moses to the door of the tabernacle of the covenant after the de- struction was over.
<br>
<br>Chapter 17
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>Speak to the children of Israel, and take of every one of them a rod by their kindreds, of all the princes of the tribes, twelve rods, and write the name of every man upon his rod.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>And the name of Aaron shall be for the tribe of Levi, and one rod shall contain all their fami- lies:
<br>And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the covenant before the testimony, where I will speak to thee.
<br>Whomsoever of these I shall choose, his rod shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, where- with they murmur against you.
<br>And Moses spoke to the children of Israel: and all the princes gave him rods one for every tribe: and there were twelve rods besides the rod of Aaron.
<br>And when Moses had Laid them up before the Lord in the tabernacle of the testimony:
<br>He returned on the following day, and found that the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi, was budded: and that the buds swelling it hid bloomed blossoms, which spreading the leaves, were formed into almonds.
<br>Moses therefore brought out all the rods from before the Lord to all the children of Is- rael: and they saw, and every one received their rods.
<br>And the Lord said to Moses: Carry back the rod of Aaron into the tabernacle of the tes- timony, that it may be kept there for a token of the rebellious children of Israel, and that their complaints may cease from me lest they die.
<br>And Moses did as the Lord had com- manded.
<br>And the children of Israel said to Moses: Behold we are consumed, we all perish.
<br>Whosoever approacheth to the tabernacle of the Lord, he dieth. Are we all to a man to be utterly destroyed?
<br> 
<br>Chapter 18
<br>And the Lord said to Aaron: Thou, and thy sons, and thy fatherâ€™s house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary: and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the sins of your priesthood. 2 And take with thee thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, and the sceptre of thy father, and let them be ready in hand, and minister to thee: but thou and thy sons shall minister in the taber-
<br>nacle of the testimony.
<br>And the Levites shall watch to do thy com- mands, and about all the works of the taberna- cle: only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary nor the altar, lest both they die, and you also perish with them.
<br>But let them be with thee, and watch in the charge of the tabernacle, and in all the cere- monies thereof. A stranger shall not join himself with you.
<br>Watch ye in the charge of the sanctuary, and in the ministry of the altar: lest indignation rise upon the children of Israel.
<br>I have given you your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel, and have de- livered them for a gift to the Lord, to serve in the ministries of the tabernacle.
<br>But thou and thy sons look ye to the priest- hood: and all things that pertain to the service of the altar, and that are within the veil, shall be executed by the priests. If any stranger shall approach, he shall be slain.
<br>And the Lord said to Aaron: Behold I have given thee the charge of my firstfruits. All things that are sanctified by the children of Israel, I have delivered to thee and to thy sons for the priestly office, by everlasting ordinances.
<br>These therefore shalt thou take of the things that are sanctified, and are offered to the Lord. Every offering, and sacrifice, and whatsoever is
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>rendered to me for sin and for trespass, and be- cometh holy of holies, shall be for thee and thy sons.
<br>Thou shalt eat it in the sanctuary: the males only shall eat thereof, because it is a con- secrated thing to thee.
<br>But the firstfruits, which the children of Israel shall vow and offer, I have given to thee, and to thy sons, and to thy daughters, by a per- petual law. He that is clean in thy house, shall eat them.
<br>All the best of the oil, and of the wine, and of the corn, whatsoever firstfruits they offer to the Lord, I have given them to thee.
<br>All the firstripe of the fruits, that the ground bringeth forth, and which are brought to the Lord, shall be for thy use: he that is clean in thy house, shall eat them.
<br>Every thing that the children of Israel shall give by vow, shall be thine.
<br>Whatsoever is firstborn of all flesh, which they offer to the Lord, whether it be of men, or of beasts, shall belong to thee: only for the firstborn of man thou shalt take a price, and ev- ery beast that is unclean thou shalt cause to be redeemed,
<br>And the redemption of it shall be after one month, for five sicles of silver, by the weight of the sanctuary. A sicle hath twenty obols.
<br>But the firstling of a cow, and of a sheep and of a goat thou shalt not cause to be re- deemed, because they are sanctified to the Lord. Their blood only thou shalt pour upon the altar, and their fat thou shalt burn for a most sweet odour to the Lord.
<br>But the flesh shall fall to thy use, as the consecrated breast, and the right shoulder shall be thine.
<br>All the firstfruits of the sanctuary which the children of Israel offer to the Lord, I have
<br> 
<br>given to thee and to thy sons and daughters, by a perpetual ordinance. It is a covenant of salt for ever before the Lord, to thee and to thy sons.
<br>And the Lord said to Aaron: You shall possess nothing in their land, neither shall you have a portion among them: I am thy portion and inheritance in the midst of the children of Israel.
<br>And I have given to the sons of Levi all the tithes of Israel for a possession, for the ministry wherewith they serve me in the tabernacle of the covenant:
<br>That the children of Israel may not ap- proach any more to the tabernacle, nor commit deadly sin,
<br>But only the sons of Levi may serve me in the tabernacle, and bear the sins of the peo- ple. It shall be an everlasting ordinance in your generations. They shall not possess any other thing,
<br>But be content with the oblation or tithes, which I have separated for their uses and neces- sities.
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>Command the Levites, and declare unto them: When you shall receive of the children of Israel the tithes, which I have given you, offer the firstfruits of them to the Lord, that is to say, the tenth part of the tenth:
<br>That it may be reckoned to you as an obla- tion of firstfruits, as well of the barnfloors as of the winepresses:
<br>And of all the things of which you receive tithes, offer the firstfruits to the Lord, and give them to Aaron the priest.
<br>All the things that you shall offer of the tithes, and shall separate for the gifts of the Lord, shall be the best and choicest things.
<br>And thou shalt say to them: If you offer all the goodly and the better things of the tithes, it
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>shall be reckoned to you as if you had given the firstfruits of the barnfloor and the winepress:
<br>And you shall eat them in all your places, both you and your families: because it is your reward for the ministry, wherewith you serve in the tabernacle of the testimony.
<br>And you shall not sin in this point, by re- serving the choicest and fat things to yourselves, lest you profane the oblations of the children of Israel, and die.
<br>
<br>Chapter 19
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying: 2 This is the observance of the victim, which the Lord hath ordained. Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee a red cow of full age, in which there is no blemish, and which
<br>hath not carried the yoke:
<br>3 And you shall deliver her to Eleazar the priest, who shall bring her forth without the camp, and shall immolate her in the sight of all: 4 And dipping his finger in her blood, shall sprinkle it over against the door of the tabernacle
<br>seven times,
<br>And shall burn her in the sight of all deliv- ering up to the fire her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, and her dung.
<br>The priest shall also take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet twice dyed, and cast it into the flame, with which the cow is consumed.
<br>And then after washing his garments, and body, he shall enter into the camp, and shall be unclean until the evening.
<br>He also that hath burned her, shall wash his garments, and his body, and shall be unclean until the evening.
<br>And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the cow, and shall pour them forth with-
<br> 
<br>out the camp in a most clean place, that they may be reserved for the multitude of the children of Israel, and for a water of aspersion: because the cow was burnt for sin.
<br>And when he that carried the ashes of the cow, hath washed his garments, he shall be un- clean until the evening. The children of Israel, and the strangers that dwell among them, shall observe this for a holy thing by a perpetual or- dinance.
<br>He that toucheth the corpse of a man, and is therefore unclean seven days,
<br>Shall be sprinkled with this water on the third day, and on the seventh, and so shall be cleansed. If he were not sprinkled on the third day, he cannot be cleansed on the seventh.
<br>Every one that toucheth the corpse of a man, and is not sprinkled with this mixture, shall profane the tabernacle of the Lord, and shall perish out of Israel: because he was not sprinkled with the water of expiation, he shall be unclean, and his uncleanness shall remain upon him.
<br>This is the law of a man that dieth in a tent: All that go into his tent and all the vessels that are there, shall be unclean seven days.
<br>The vessel that hath no cover, nor binding over it, shall be unclean.
<br>If any man in the field touch the corpse of a man that was slain, or that died of himself, or his bone, or his grave, he shall be unclean seven days.
<br>And they shall take of the ashes of the burning and of the sin offering, and shall pour living waters upon them into a vessel.
<br>And a man that is clean shall dip hyssop in them, and shall sprinkle therewith all the tent, and all the furniture, and the men that are de- filed with touching any such thing:
<br>And in this manner he that is clean shall
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>purify the unclean on the third and on the sev- enth day. And being expiated the seventh day, he shall wash both himself and his garments, and be unclean until the evening.
<br>If any man be not expiated after this rite, his soul shall perish out of the midst of the church: because he hath profaned the sanctu- ary of the Lord, and was not sprinkled with the water of purification.
<br>This precept shall be an ordinance for ever. He also that sprinkled the water, shall wash his garments. Every one that shall touch the waters of expiation, shall be unclean until the evening. 22 Whatsoever a person toucheth who is un- clean, he shall make it unclean: and the person that toucheth any of these things, shall be un-
<br>clean until the evening.
<br>
<br>Chapter 20
<br>And the children of Israel, and all the multitude came into the desert of Sin, in the first month: and the people abode in Cades. And Mary died there, and was buried in the same place.
<br>And the people wanting water, came to- gether against Moses and Aaron:
<br>And making a sedition, they said: Would God we had perished among our brethren before the Lord.
<br>Why have you brought out the church of the Lord into the wilderness, that both we and our cattle should die?
<br>Why have you made us come up out of Egypt, and have brought us into this wretched place which cannot be sowed, nor bringeth forth figs, nor vines, nor pomegranates, neither is there any water to drink?
<br>And Moses and Aaron leaving the multitude, went into the tabernacle of the covenant, and fell
<br> 
<br>flat upon the ground, and cried to the Lord, and said. O Lord God, hear the cry of this people, and open to them thy treasure, a fountain of living water, that being satisfied, they may cease to murmur. And the glory of the Lord appeared over them.
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>Take the rod, and assemble the people to- gether, thou and Aaron thy brother, and speak to the rock before them, and it shall yield wa- ters. And when thou hast brought forth water out of the rock, all the multitude and their cattle shall drink.
<br>Moses therefore took the rod, which was be- fore the Lord, as he had commanded him,
<br>And having gathered together the multi- tude before the rock, he said to them: Hear, ye rebellious and incredulous: Can we bring you forth water out of this rock?
<br>And when Moses bad lifted up his hand, and struck the rock twice with the rod, there came forth water in great abundance, so that the people and their cattle drank,
<br>And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron: Because you have not believed me, to sanctify me before the children of Israel, you shall not bring these people into the land, which I will give them.
<br>This is the Water of contradiction, where the children of Israel strove with words against the Lord, and he was sanctified in them.
<br>In the mean time Moses sent messengers from Cades to the king of Edom, to say: Thus saith thy brother Israel: Thou knowest all the labour that hath come upon us:
<br>In what manner our fathers went down into Egypt, and there we dwelt a long time, and the Egyptians afflicted us and our fathers.
<br>And how we cried to the Lord, and he heard us, and sent an angel, who hath brought us out
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>of Egypt. Lo, we are now in the city of Cades, which is in the uttermost of thy borders,
<br>And we beseech thee that we may have leave to pass through thy country. We will not go through the fields, nor through the vineyards, we will not drink the waters of thy wells, but we will go by the common highway, neither turning aside to the right hand, nor to the left, till we are past thy borders.
<br>And Edom answered them: Thou shalt not pass by me: if thou dost I will come out armed against thee.
<br>And the children of Israel said: We will go by the beaten way: and if we and our cattle drink of thy waters, we will give thee what is just: there shall be no difficulty in the price, only let us pass speedily.
<br>But he answered: Thou shalt not pass. And immediately he came forth to meet them with an infinite multitude, and a strong hand,
<br>Neither would he condescend to their de- sire to grant them passage through his borders. Wherefore Israel turned another way from him.
<br>And when they had removed the camp from Cades, they came to mount Hor, which is in the borders of the land of Edom:
<br>Where the Lord spoke to Moses:
<br>Let Aaron, saith he, go to his people: for he shall not go into the land which I have given the children of Israel, because he was incredulous to my words, at the waters of contradiction.
<br>Take Aaron and his son with him, and bring them up into mount Hor:
<br>And when thou hast stripped the father of his vesture, thou shalt vest therewith Eleazar his son: Aaron shall be gathered to his people, and die there.
<br>Moses did as the Lord had commanded: and they went up into mount Hor before all the multitude.
<br> 
<br>And when he had stripped Aaron of his vestments, he vested Eleazar his son with them. 29 And  Aaron being  dead in the  top of the
<br>mountain, he came down with Eleazar.
<br>30 And all the multitude seeing that Aaron was dead, mourned for him thirty days through- out all their families.
<br>
<br>Chapter 21
<br>And when king Arad the Chanaanite, who dwelt towards the south, had heard this, to wit, that Israel was come by the way of the spies, he fought against them, and overcoming them carried off their spoils.
<br>But Israel binding himself by vow to the Lord, said: If thou wilt deliver thus people into my hand, I will utterly destroy their cities.
<br>And the Lord heard the prayers of Israel, and delivered up the Chanaanite, and they cut them off and destroyed their cities: and they called the name of that place Horma, that is to say, Anathema.
<br>And they marched from mount Hor, by the way that leadeth to the Red Sea, to compass the land of Edom. And the people began to be weary of their journey and labour:
<br>And speaking against God and Moses, they said: Why didst thou bring us out of Egypt, to die in the wilderness? There is no bread, nor have we any waters: our soul now loatheth this very light food.
<br>Wherefore the Lord sent among the people fiery serpents, which bit them and killed many of them.
<br>Upon which they came to Moses, and said; We have sinned, because we have spoken against the Lord and thee: pray that he may take away these serpents from us. And Moses prayed for
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>the people.
<br>And the Lord said to him: Make a brazen serpent, and set it up for a sign: whosoever being struck shall look on it, shall live.
<br>Moses therefore made a brazen serpent, and set it up for a sign: which when they that were bitten looked upon, they were healed.
<br>And the children of Israel setting forwards camped in Oboth.
<br>And departing thence they pitched their tents in Jeabarim, in the wilderness, that faceth Moab toward the east.
<br>And removing from thence, they came to the torrent Zared:
<br>Which they left and encamped over against Arnon, which is in the desert and standeth out on the borders of the Amorrhite. For Arnon is the border of Moab, dividing the Moabites and the Amorrhites.
<br>Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the Lord: As he did in the Red Sea, so will he do in the streams of Arnon.
<br>The rocks of the torrents were bowed down that they might rest in Ar, and lie down in the borders of the Moabites.
<br>When they went from that place, the well appeared whereof the Lord said to Moses: Gather the people together, and I will give them water.
<br>Then Israel sung this song: Let the well spring up. They sung thereto:
<br>The well, which the princes dug, and the chiefs of the people prepared by the direction of the lawgiver, and with their staves. And they marched from the wilderness to Mathana.
<br>From Mathana unto Nahaliel: from Na- haliel unto Bamoth.
<br>From Bamoth, is a valley in the country of Moab, to the top of Phasga, which looked to- wards the desert.
<br> 
<br>And Israel sent messengers to Sehon king of the Amorrhites, saying:
<br>I beseech thee that I may have leave to pass through thy land: we will not go aside into the fields or the vineyards, we will not drink waters of the wells, we will go the kingâ€™s highway, till we be past thy borders.
<br>And he would not grant that Israel should pass by his borders: but rather gathering an army, went forth to meet them in the desert, and came to Jasa and fought against them.
<br>And he was slain by them with the edge of the sword, and they possessed his land from the Arnon unto the Jeboc, and to the confines of the children of Ammon: for the borders of the Ammonites, were kept with a strong garrison.
<br>So Israel took all his cities, and dwelt in the cities of the Amorrhite, to wit, in Hesebon, and in the villages thereof.
<br>Hesebon was the city of Sehon the king of the Amorrhites, who fought against the king of Moab: and took all the land, that had been of his dominion, as far as the Arnon.
<br>Therefore it is said in the proverb: Come into Hesebon, let the city of Sehon be built and set up:
<br>A fire is gone out of Hesebon, a flame from the city of Sehon, and hath consumed Ar of the Moabites, and the inhabitants of the high places of the Arnon.
<br>Woe to thee Moab: thou art undone, O people of Chamos. He hath given his sons to flight, and his daughters into captivity to Sehon the king of the Amorrhites.
<br>Their yoke is perished from Hesebon unto Dibon, they came weary to Nophe, and unto Medaba.
<br>So Israel dwelt in the land of the Amor- rhite.
<br>And Moses sent some to take a view of
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Jazer: and they took the villages of it, and con- quered the inhabitants.
<br>And they turned themselves, and went up by the way of Basan, and Og the king of Basan came against them with all his people, to fight in Edrai.
<br>And the Lord said to Moses: Fear him not, for I have delivered him and all his people, and his country into thy hand: and thou shalt do to him as thou didst to Sehon the king of the Amorrhites, the inhabitant of Hesebon.
<br>So they slew him also with his sons, and all his people, not letting any one escape, and they possessed his land.
<br>
<br>Chapter 22
<br>And they went forward and encamped in the plains of Moab, over against where Jericho is sit- uate beyond the Jordan.
<br>And Balac the son of Sephor, seeing all that Israel had done to the Amorrhite,
<br>And that the Moabites were in great fear of him, and were not able to sustain his assault,
<br>He said to the elders of Madian: So will this people destroy all that dwell in our borders, as the ox is wont to eat the grass to the very roots. Now he was at that time king in Moab.
<br>He sent therefore messengers to Balaam the son of Beor, a soothsayer, who dwelt by the river of the land of the children of Ammon, to call him, and to say: Behold a people is come out of Egypt, that hath covered the face of the earth, sitting over against me.
<br>Come therefore, and curse this people, be- cause it is mightier than I: if by any means I may beat them and drive them out of my land: for I know that he whom thou shalt bless is blessed, and he whom thou shalt curse is cursed.
<br> 
<br>And the ancients of Moab, and the elders of Madian, went with the price of divination in their hands. And where they were come to Bal- aam, and had told him all the words of Balac:
<br>He answered: Tarry here this night and I will answer whatsoever the Lord shall say to me. And while they stayed with Balaam, God came and said to him:
<br>What mean these men that are with thee?
<br>He answered: Balac the son of Sephor king of the Moabites hath sent to me,
<br>Saying: Behold a people that is come out of Egypt, hath covered the face of the land: come and curse them, if by any means I may fight with them and drive them away.
<br>And God said to Balaam: Thou shalt not go with them, nor shalt thou curse the people: because it is blessed.
<br>And he rose in the morning and said to the princes: Go into your country, because the Lord hath forbid me to come with you.
<br>The princes returning, said to Balac: Bal- aam would not come with us.
<br>Then he sent many more and more noble than he had sent before:
<br>Who, when they were come to Balaam, said: Thus saith Balac the son of Sephor, De- lay not to come to me:
<br>For I am ready to honour thee, and will give thee whatsoever thou wilt: come and curse this people.
<br>Balaam answered: If Balac would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot alter the word of the Lord my God, to speak either more or less.
<br>I pray you to stay here this night also, that I may know what the Lord will answer me once more.
<br>God therefore came to Balaam in the night, and said to him: If these men be come to call
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>thee, arise and go with them: yet so, that thou do what I shall command thee.
<br>Balaam arose in the morning, and saddling his ass went with them.
<br>And God was angry. And an angel of the Lord stood in the way against Balaam, who sat on the ass, and had two servants with him.
<br>The ass seeing the angel standing in the way, with a drawn sword, turned herself out of the way, and went into the field. And when Bal- aam beat her, and had a mind to bring her again to the way,
<br>The angel stood in a narrow place be- tween two walls, wherewith the vineyards were enclosed.
<br>And the ass seeing him, thrust herself close to the wall, and bruised the foot of the rider. But he beat her again:
<br>And nevertheless the angel going on to a narrow place, where there was no way to turn aside either to the right hand or to the left, stood to meet him.
<br>And when the ass saw the angel standing, she fell under the feet of the rider: who being an- gry beat her sides more vehemently with a staff. 28 And the Lord opened the mouth of the ass, and she said: What have I done to thee? Why
<br>strikest thou me, lo, now this third time?
<br>Balaam answered: Because thou hast de- served it, and hast served me ill: I would I had a sword that I might kill thee.
<br>The ass said: Am not I thy beast, on which thou hast been always accustomed to ride until this present day? tell me if I ever did the like thing to thee. But he said: Never.
<br>Forthwith the Lord opened the eyes of Bal- aam, and he saw the angel standing in the way with a drawn sword, and he worshipped him falling flat on the ground.
<br>And the angel said to him: Why beatest
<br> 
<br>thou thy ass these three times? I am come to withstand thee, because thy way is perverse, and contrary to me:
<br>And unless the ass had turned out of the way, giving place to me who stood against thee, I had slain thee, and she should have lived.
<br>Balaam said: I have sinned, not knowing that thou didst stand against me: and now if it displease thee that I go, I will return.
<br>The angel said: Go with these men, and see thou speak no other thing than what I shall com- mand thee. He went therefore with the princes. 36 And when Balac heard it he came forth to meet him in a town of the Moabites, that is
<br>situate in the uttermost borders of Arnon.
<br>And he said to Balaam: I sent messengers to call thee, why didst thou not come immedi- ately to me? was it because I am not able to reward thy coming?
<br>He answered him: Lo, here I am: shall I have power to speak any other thing but that which God shall put in my mouth?
<br>So they went on together, and came into a city, that was in the uttermost borders of his kingdom.
<br>And when Balac had killed oxen and sheep, he sent presents to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him.
<br>And when morning was come, he brought him to the high places of Baal, and he beheld the uttermost part of the people.
<br>
<br>Chapter 23
<br>And Balaam said to Balac: Build me here seven altars, and prepare as many calves, and the same number of rams.
<br>2 And when he had done according to the word of Balaam, they laid together a calf and
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>a ram upon every altar.
<br>3	And Balaam said to Balac: Stand a while by thy burnt offering, until I go, to see if perhaps the Lord will meet me, and whatsoever he shall command, I will speak to thee.
<br>4	And when he was gone with speed, God met him. And Balaam speaking to him, said: I have erected seven altars, and have laid on everyone a calf and a ram.
<br>5	And the Lord put the word in his mouth, and said: Return to Balac, and thus shalt thou speak.
<br>6	Returning he found Balac standing   by his burnt offering, with all the princes of the Moabites:
<br>7	And taking up his parable, he said: Balac king of the Moabites hath brought me from Aram, from the mountains of the east: Come, said he, and curse Jacob: make haste and detest Israel.
<br>8	How shall I curse him, whom God hath not cursed? By what means should I detest him, whom the Lord detesteth not?
<br>9	I shall see him from the tops of the rocks, and shall consider him from the hills. This peo- ple shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.
<br>10	Who can count the dust of Jacob, and know the number of the stock of Israel? Let my soul die the death of the just, and my last end be like to them.
<br>11	And Balac said to Balaam: What is this that thou dost? I sent for thee to curse my ene- mies: and thou contrariwise blessest them.
<br>12	He answered him: Can I speak any thing else but what the Lord commandeth?
<br>13	Balac therefore said: Come with me to an- other place from whence thou mayest see part of Israel, and canst not see them all: curse them from thence.
<br> 
<br>14	And when he had brought him to a high place, upon the top of mount Phasga, Balaam built seven altars, and laying on every one a calf and a ram,
<br>15	He said to Balac: Stand here by thy burnt offering while I go to meet him.
<br>16	And when the Lord had met him, and had put the word in his mouth, he said: Return to Balac, and thus shalt thou say to him.
<br>17	Returning he found him standing by his burnt sacrifice, and the princes of the Moabites with him. And Balac said to him: What hath the Lord spoken?
<br>18	But he taking up his parable, said: Stand, O Balac, and give ear: hear, thou son of Sephor: 19 God is not a man, that he should lie, nor
<br>is the son of man, that he should be changed. Hath he said then, and will he not do? hath he spoken, and will he not fulfil?
<br>I was brought to bless, the blessing I am not able to hinder.
<br>There is no idol in Jacob, neither is there an image god to be seen in Israel. The Lord his God is with him, and the sound of the victory of the king in him.
<br>God hath brought him out of Egypt, whose strength is like to the rhinoceros.
<br>There is no soothsaying in Jacob, nor div- ination in Israel. In their times it shall be told to Jacob and to Israel what God hath wrought. 24 Behold the people shall rise up as a lioness, and shall lift itself up as a lion: it shall not lie down till it devour the prey, and drink the blood
<br>of the slain.
<br>And Balac said to Balaam: Neither curse, nor bless him.
<br>And he said: Did I not tell thee, that what- soever God should command me, that I would do?
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>And Balac said to him: Come and I will bring thee to another place; if peradventure it please God that thou mayest curse them from thence.
<br>And when he had brought him upon the top of mount Phogor, which looketh towards the wilderness,
<br>Balaam said to him: Build me here seven altars, and prepare as many calves, and the same number of rams.
<br>Balac did as Balaam had said: and he laid on every altar, a calf and a ram.
<br>
<br>Chapter 24
<br>And when Balaam saw that it pleased the Lord that he should bless Israel, he went not as he had gone before, to seek divination: but setting his face towards the desert,
<br>And lifting up his eyes, he saw Israel abiding in their tents by their tribes: and the spirit of God rushing upon him,
<br>He took up his parable and said: Balaam the son of Beor hath said: The man hath said, whose eye is stopped up:
<br>The bearer of the words of God hath said, he that hath beheld the vision of the Almighty, he that falleth, and so his eyes are opened:
<br>How beautiful are thy tabernacles O Jacob, and thy tents, O Israel!
<br>As woody valleys, as watered gardens near the rivers, as tabernacles which the Lord hath pitched, as cedars by the waterside.
<br>Water shall flow out of his bucket, and his seed shall be in many waters. For Agag his king shall be removed, and his kingdom shall be taken away.
<br>God hath brought him out of Egypt, whose strength is like to the rhinoceros. They shall de-
<br> 
<br>vour the nations that are his enemies, and break their bones, and pierce them with arrows.
<br>Lying down he hath slept as a lion, and as a lioness, whom none shall dare to rouse. He that blesseth thee, shall also himself be blessed: he that curseth thee shall be reckoned accursed.
<br>And Balac being angry against Balaam, clapped his hands together and said: I called thee to curse my enemies, and thou on the con- trary hast blessed them three times.
<br>Return to thy place. I had determined in- deed greatly to honour thee, but the Lord hath deprived thee of the honour designed for thee.
<br>Balaam made answer to Balac: Did I not say to thy messengers, whom thou sentest to me: 13 If Balac would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the Lord my God, to utter any thing of my own head either good or evil: but whatsoever
<br>the Lord shall say, that I will speak?
<br>But yet going to my people, I will give thee counsel, what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days.
<br>Therefore taking up his parable, again he said: Balaam the son of Beor hath said: The man whose eye is stopped up, hath said:
<br>The hearer of the words of God hath said, who knoweth the doctrine of the Highest, and seeth the visions of the Almighty, who falling hath his eyes opened:
<br>I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not near. A STAR SHALL RISE out of Jacob and a sceptre shall spring up from Israel: and shall strike the chiefs of Moab, and shall waste all the children of Seth
<br>And he shall possess Idumea: the inher- itance of Seir shall come to their enemies, but Israel shall do manfully.
<br>Out of Jacob shall he come that shall rule, and shall destroy the remains of the city.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>And when he saw Amalec, he took up his parable, and said: Amalec the beginning of na- tions, whose latter ends shall be destroyed.
<br>He saw also the Cinite: and took up his parable, and said:	Thy habitation indeed is strong: but though thou build thy nest in a rock, 22 And thou be chosen of the stock of Cin, how long shalt thou be able to continue? For
<br>Assur shall take thee captive.
<br>And taking up his parable, again he said: Alas, who shall live when God shall do these things?
<br>They shall come in galleys from Italy, they shall overcome the Assyrians, and shall waste the Hebrews, and at the last they themselves also shall perish.
<br>And Balaam rose, and returned to his place: Balac also returned the way that he came.
<br>
<br>Chapter 25
<br>And Israel at that time abode in Settim, and the people committed fornication with the daughters of Moab,
<br>Who called them to their sacrifices. And they ate of them, and adored their gods.
<br>And Israel was initiated to Beelphegor: upon which the Lord being angry,
<br>Said to Moses: Take all the princes of the people, and hang them up on gibbets against the sun: that my fury may be turned away from Israel.
<br>And Moses said to the judges of Israel: Let every man kill his neighbours, that have been initiated to Beelphegor.
<br>And behold one of the children of Israel went in before his brethren to a harlot of Madian, in the sight of Moses and of all the children of Is- rael, who were weeping before the door of the
<br> 
<br>tabernacle.
<br>And when Phinees the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest saw it, he rose up from the midst of the multitude, and taking a dagger, 8 Went in after the Israelite into the brothel house, and thrust both of them through to- gether, to wit, the man and the woman in the genital parts. And the scourge ceased from the
<br>children of Israel.
<br>And there were slain four and twenty thou- sand men.
<br>And the Lord said to Moses:
<br>Phinees the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned away my wrath from the children of Israel: because he was moved with my zeal against them, that I myself might not destroy the children of Israel in my zeal.
<br>Therefore say to him: behold I give him the peace of my covenant,
<br>And the covenant of the priesthood for ever shall be both to him and his seed, because he hath been zealous for his God, and hath made atonement for the wickedness of the children of Israel.
<br>And the name of the Israelite, that was slain with the woman of Madian, was Zambri the son of Salu, a prince of the kindred and tribe of Simeon.
<br>And the Madianite woman, that was slain with him, was called Cozbi the daughter of Sur, a most noble prince among the Madianites.
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>Let the Madianites find you their enemies, and slay you them:
<br>Because they also have acted like enemies against you, and have guilefully deceived you by the idol Phogor, and Cozbi their sister, a daugh- ter of a prince of Madian, who was slain in the day of the plague for the sacrilege of Phogor.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 26
<br>After the blood of the guilty was shed, the Lord said to Moses and to Eleazar the son of Aaron, the priest:
<br>Number the whole sum of the children of Israel from twenty years old and upward, by their houses and kindreds, all that are able to go forth to war.
<br>Moses therefore and Eleazar the priest, be- ing in the plains of Moab upon the Jordan over against Jericho, spoke to them that were
<br>From twenty years old and upward, as the Lord had commanded: and this is the number of them:
<br>Ruben the firstborn of Israel. His sons were Henoch, of whom is the family of the Henochites: and Phallu, of whom is the family of the Phal- luites:
<br>And Hesron, of whom is the family of the Hesronites: and Charmi, of whom is the family of the Charmites.
<br>These are the families of the stock of Ruben: whose number was found to be forty-three thou- sand seven hundred and thirty.
<br>The son of Phallu was Eliab.
<br>His sons, were Namuel and Dathan and Abiron. These are Dathan and Abiron the princes of the people, that rose against Moses and Aaron in the sedition of Core, when they rebelled against the Lord:
<br>And the earth opening her mouth swal- lowed up Core, many others dying, when the fire burned two hundred and fifty men. And there was a great miracle wrought,
<br>That when Core perished, his sons did not perish.
<br>The sons of Simeon by their kindreds: Na- muel, of him is the family of the Namuelites: Jamin, of him is the family of the Jaminites:
<br> 
<br>Jachim, of him is the family of the Jachimites:

<br>These are the families of Gad, of which the whole number was forty thousand five hundred. 19 The sons of Juda, Her and Onan, who both
<br>died in the land of Chanaan.
<br>And the sons of Juda by their kindreds were: Sela, of whom is the family of the Selaites: Phares, of whom is the family of the Pharesites: Zare, of whom is the family of the Zarites.
<br>Moreover the sons of Phares were: Hesron, of whom is the family of the Hesronites: and Hamul, of whom is the family of the Hamulites. 22 These are the families of Juda, of which the whole number was seventy-six thousand five
<br>hundred.
<br>The sons of Issachar, by their kindreds: Thola of whom is the family of the Tholaites: Phua, of whom is the family of the Phuaites:

<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>These are the kindreds of Zabulon, whose number was sixty thousand five hundred.
<br>The sons of Joseph by their kindred, Man- asses and Ephraim.
<br>Of Manasses was born Machir, of whom is the family of the Machirites. Machir begot Galaad, of whom is the family of the Galaadites. 30 Galaad had sons: Jezer, of whom is the family of the Jezerites: and Helec, of whom is
<br>the family of the Helecites:
<br>And Asriel, of whom is the family of the Asrielites: and Sechem, of whom is the family of the Sechemites:
<br>And Semida, of whom is the family of the Semidaites: and Hepher, of whom is the family of the Hepherites.
<br>And Hepher was the father of Salphaad, who had no sons, but only daughters, whose names are these: Maala, and Noa, and Hegla, and Melcha, and Thersa.
<br>These are the families of Manasses, and the number of them fifty-two thousand seven hun- dred.
<br>And the sons of Ephraim by their kindreds were these: Suthala, of whom is the family of the Suthalaites: Becher, of whom is the family of the Becherites: Thehen, of whom is the family of the Thehenites.
<br>Now the son of Suthala was Heran, of whom is the family of the Heranites.
<br>These are the kindreds of the sons of Ephraim: whose number was thirty-two thou- sand five hundred.
<br>These are the sons of Joseph by their fam- ilies. The sons of Benjamin in their kindreds: Bela, of whom is the family of the Belaites: As- bel, of whom is the family of the Asbelites: Ahi- ram, of whom is the family of the Ahiramites:
<br>Supham, of whom is the family of the Suphamites: Hupham, of whom is the family of

<br>The sons of Aser by their kindreds: Jemna, of whom is the family of the Jemnaites: Jessui, of whom is the family of the Jessuites: Brie, of whom is the family of the Brieites.
<br>The sons of Brie: Heber, of whom is the family of the Heberites: and Melchiel, of whom is the family of the Melchielites.
<br>And the name of the daughter of Aser, was Sara.
<br>These are the kindreds of the sons of Aser, and their number fifty-three thousand four hun- dred.
<br>The sons of Nephtali by their kindreds: Je- siel, of whom is the family of the Jesielites: Guni, of whom is the family of the Gunites:
<br>Jeser, of whom is the family of the Je- serites: Sellem, of whom is the family of the Sellemites.
<br>These are the kindreds of the sons of Neph- tali by their families: whose number was forty- five thousand four hundred.
<br>This is the sum of the children of Israel, that were reckoned up, six hundred and one thousand seven hundred and thirty.
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>To these shall the land be divided for their possessions according to the number of names.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>To the greater number thou shalt give a greater portion, and to the fewer a less: to every one, as they have now been reckoned up, shall a possession be delivered:
<br>Yet so that by lot the land be divided to the tribe and families.
<br>Whatsoever shall fall by lot, that shall be taken by the more, or the fewer.
<br>This also is the number of the sons of Levi by their families: Gerson, of whom is the family of the Gersonites: Caath, of whom is the family of the Caathites: Merari, of whom is the family of the Merarites.
<br>These are the families of Levi: The family of Lobni, the family of Hebroni, the family of Core. Now Caath begot Amram:
<br>Who had to wife Jochabed the daughter of Levi, who was born to him in Egypt. She bore to her husband Amram sons, Aaron and Moses, and Mary their sister.
<br>Of Aaron were born Nadab and Abiu, and Eleazar and Ithamar:
<br>Of whom Nadab and Abiu died, when they had offered the strange fire before the Lord.
<br>And all that were numbered, were twenty- three thousand males from one month old and upward: for they were not reckoned up among the children of Israel, neither was a possession given to them with the rest.
<br>This is the number of the children of Is- rael, that were enrolled by Moses and Eleazar the priest, in the plains of Moab upon the Jor- dan, over against Jericho.
<br>Among whom there was not one of them that were numbered before by Moses and Aaron in the desert of Sinai.
<br>For the Lord had foretold that they should die in the wilderness. And none remained of them, but Caleb the son of Jephone, and Josue the son of Nun.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 27
<br>Then came the daughters of Salphaad, the son of Hepher, the son of Galaad, the son of Machir, the son of Manasses, who was the son of Joseph: and their names are Maala, and Noa, and Hegla, and Melcha, and Thersa.
<br>And they stood before Moses and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the people at the door of the tabernacle of the covenant, and said:
<br>Our father died in the desert, and was not in the sedition, that was raised against the Lord under Core, but he died in his own sin: and he had no male children. Why is his name taken away out of his family, because he had no son? Give us a possession among the kinsmen of our father.
<br>And Moses referred their cause to the judg- ment of the Lord.
<br>And the Lord said to him:
<br>The daughters of Salphaad demand a just thing: Give them a possession among their fa- therâ€™s kindred, and let them succeed him in his inheritance.
<br>And to the children of Israel thou shalt speak these things:
<br>When a man dieth without a son, his inher- itance shall pass to his daughter.
<br>If he have no daughter, his brethren shall succeed him.
<br>And if he have no brethren, you shall give the inheritance to his fatherâ€™s brethren.
<br>But if he have no uncles by the father, the inheritance shall be given to them that are the next akin. And this shall be to the children of Israel sacred by a perpetual law, as the Lord hath commanded Moses.
<br>The Lord also said to Moses: Go up into this mountain Abarim, and view from thence the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>land which I will give to the children of Israel.
<br>And when thou shalt have seen it, thou also shalt go to thy people, as thy brother Aaron is gone:
<br>Because you offended me in the desert of Sin in the contradiction of the multitude, neither would you sanctify me before them at the waters. These are the waters of contradiction in Cades of the desert of Sin.
<br>And Moses answered him:
<br>16 May the Lord the God of the spirits of all flesh provide a man, that may be over this multitude:
<br>And may go out and in before them, and may lead them out, or bring them in: lest the people of the Lord be as sheep without a shep- herd.
<br>And the Lord said to him: take Josue the son of Nun,  a man in whom is the Spirit, and put thy hand upon him.
<br>And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest and all the multitude:
<br>And thou shalt give him precepts in the sight of all, and part of thy glory, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may hear him.
<br>If any thing be to be done, Eleazar the priest shall consult the Lord for him. He and all the children of Israel with him, and the rest of the multitude shall go out and go in at his word.
<br>Moses did as the Lord had commanded. And, when he had taken Josue, he set him before Eleazar the priest, and all the assembly of the people,
<br>And laying his hands on his head, he re- peated all things that the Lord had commanded.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 28
<br>The Lord also said to Moses:
<br>Command the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: Offer ye my oblation and my bread, and burnt sacrifice of most sweet odour, in their due seasons.
<br>These are the sacrifices which you shall offer: Two lambs of a year old without blemish every day for the perpetual holocaust:
<br>One you shall offer in the mornings, and the other in the evening:
<br>And the tenth part of an ephi of flour, which shall be tempered with the, purest oil, of the measure of the fourth part of a hin.
<br>It is the continual holocaust which you of- fered in mount Sinai for a most sweet odour of a sacrifice by fire to the Lord.
<br>And for a libation you shall offer of wine the fourth part of a hin for every lamb in the sanctuary of the Lord.
<br>And you shall offer the other lamb in like manner in the evening according to all the rites of the morning sacrifice, and of the libations thereof, an oblation of most sweet odour to the Lord.
<br>And on the sabbath day you shall offer two lambs of a year old without blemish, and two tenths of flour tempered with oil in sacrifice, and the libations,
<br>Which regularly are poured out every sab- bath for the perpetual holocaust.
<br>And on the first day of the month you shall offer a holocaust to the Lord, two calves of the herd, one ram, and seven lambs of a year old, without blemish,
<br>And three tenths of flour tempered with oil in sacrifice for every calf: and two tenths of flour tempered with oil for every ram:
<br>And the tenth of a tenth of flour tempered
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>with oil in sacrifice for every lamb. It is a holo- caust of most sweet odour and an offering by fire to the Lord.
<br>And these shall be the libations of wine that are to be poured out for every victim: Half a hin for every calf, a third for a ram, and a fourth for a lamb. This shall be the holocaust for every month, as they succeed one another in the course of the year.
<br>A buck goat also shall be offered to the Lord for a sin offering over and above the per- petual holocaust with its libations.
<br>And in the first month, on the four tenth day of the month, shall be the phase of the Lord, 17 And on the fifteenth day the solemn feast:
<br>seven days shall they eat unleavened bread.
<br>And the first day of them shall be venera- ble and holy: you shall not do any servile work therein.
<br>And you shall offer a burnt sacrifice a holo- caust to the Lord, two calves of the herd, one ram, seven lambs of a year old, without blemish:
<br>And for the sacrifice of every one three tenths of flour which shall be tempered with oil to every calf, and two tenths to every ram,
<br>And the tenth of a tenth, to every lamb, that is to say, to all the seven lambs:
<br>And one buck goat for sin, to make atone- ment for you,
<br>Besides the morning holocaust which you shall always offer.
<br>So shall you do every day of the seven days for the food of the fire, and for a most sweet odour to the Lord, which shall rise from the holo- caust, and from the libations of each.
<br>The seventh day also shall be most solemn and holy unto you, you shall do no servile work therein.
<br>The day also of firstfruits, when after the weeks are accomplished, you shall offer new
<br> 
<br>fruits to the Lord, shall be venerable and holy: you shall do no servile work therein.
<br>And you shall offer a holocaust for a most sweet odour to the Lord, two calves of the herd, one ram, and seven lambs of a year old, without blemish:
<br>And in the sacrifices of them three tenths of flour tempered with oil to every calf, two to every ram,
<br>The tenth of a tenth to every lamb, which in all are seven lambs: a buck goat also,
<br>Which is slain for expiation: besides the perpetual holocaust and the libations thereof.
<br>You shall offer them all without blemish with their libations.
<br>
<br>Chapter 29
<br>The first day also of the seventh month shall be venerable and holy unto you; you shall do no servile work therein, because it is the day of the sounding and of trumpets.
<br>And you shall offer a holocaust for a most sweet odour to the Lord, one calf of the herd, one ram and seven lambs of a year old, without blemish.
<br>And for their sacrifices, three tenths of flour tempered with oil to every calf, two tenths to a ram,
<br>One tenth to a lamb, which in all are seven lambs:
<br>And a buck goat for sin, which is offered for the expiation of the people,
<br>Besides the holocaust of the first day of the month with the sacrifices thereof, and the per- petual holocaust with the accustomed libations. With the same ceremonies you shall offer a burnt sacrifice for a most sweet odour to the Lord.
<br>The tenth day also of this seventh month
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>shall be holy and venerable unto you, and you shall afflict your souls; you shall do no servile work therein.
<br>And you shall offer a holocaust to the Lord for a most sweet odour, one calf of the herd, one ram, and seven lambs of a year old, without blemish:
<br>And for their sacrifices, three tenths of flour tempered with oil to every calf, two tenths to a ram,
<br>The tenth of a tenth to every lamb, which are in all seven lambs:
<br>And a buck goat for sin, besides the things that are wont to be offered for sin, for expia- tion, and for the perpetual holocaust with their sacrifice and libations.
<br>And on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, which shall be unto you holy and ven- erable, you shall do no servile work, but shall celebrate a solemnity to the Lord seven days.
<br>And you shall offer a holocaust for a most sweet odour to the Lord, thirteen calves of the herd, two rams, and fourteen lambs of a year old, without blemish:
<br>And for their libations three tenths of flour tempered with oil to every calf, being in all thir- teen calves: and two tenths to each ram, being two rams,
<br>And the tenth of a tenth to every lamb, being in all fourteen lambs:
<br>And a buck goat for sin, besides the perpet- ual holocaust, and the sacrifice and the libation thereof.
<br>On the second day you shall offer twelve calves of the herd, two rams and fourteen lambs of a year old, without blemish:
<br>And the sacrifices and the libations for ev- ery one, for the calves and for the rams and for the lambs you shall duly celebrate:
<br>And a buck goat for a sin offering besides
<br> 
<br>the perpetual holocaust, and the sacrifice and the libation thereof.
<br>The third day you shall offer eleven calves, two rams, and fourteen lambs of a year old, with- out blemish:
<br>And the sacrifices and the libations of every one for the calves and for the rams and for the lambs you shall offer according to the rite:
<br>And a buck goat for sin, besides the perpet- ual holocaust, and the sacrifice, and the libation thereof.
<br>The fourth day you shall offer ten calves, two rams, and fourteen lambs of a year old, with- out blemish:
<br>And the sacrifices and the libations of every one for the calves and for the rams and for the lambs you shall celebrate in right manner:
<br>And a buck goat for sin, besides the perpet- ual holocaust, and the sacrifice and the libation thereof.
<br>The fifth day you shall offer nine calves, two rams, and fourteen lambs of a year old, with- out blemish:
<br>And the sacrifices and the libations of every one for the calves and for the rams and for the lambs you shall celebrate according to the rite:
<br>And a buck goat for sin, besides the perpet- ual holocaust, and the sacrifice and the libation thereof.
<br>The sixth day you shall offer eight calves, two rams, and fourteen lambs of a year old, with- out blemish:
<br>And the sacrifices and the libations of every one for the calves and for the rams and for the lambs you shall celebrate according to the rite:
<br>And a buck goat for sin, besides the perpet- ual holocaust, and the sacrifice and the libation thereof.
<br>The seventh day you shall offer seven calves and two rams, and fourteen lambs of a year old,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>without blemish:
<br>And the sacrifices and the libations of every one for the calves and for the rams and for the lambs you shall celebrate according to the rite:
<br>And a buck goat for sin, besides the perpet- ual holocaust, and the sacrifice and the libation thereof.
<br>On the eighth day, which is most solemn, you shall do no servile work:
<br>But you shall offer a holocaust for a most sweet odour to the Lord, one calf, one ram, and seven lambs of a year old, without blemish:
<br>And the sacrifices and the libations of every one for the calves and for the rams and for the lambs you shall celebrate according to the rite:
<br>And a buck goat for sin, besides the perpet- ual holocaust, and the sacrifice and the libation thereof.
<br>These things shall you offer to the Lord in your solemnities: besides your vows and vol- untary oblations for holocaust, for sacrifice, for libation, and for victims of peace offerings.
<br>
<br>Chapter 30
<br>And Moses told the children of Israel all that the Lord had commanded him:
<br>And he said to the princes of the tribes of the children of Israel: This is the word that the Lord hath commanded:
<br>If any man make a vow to the Lord, or bind himself by an oath: he shall not make his word void but shall fulfil all that he promised.
<br>If a woman vow any thing, and bind herself by an oath, being in her fatherâ€™s house, and but yet a girl in age: if her father knew the vow that she hath promised, and the oath wherewith she hath bound her soul, and held his peace, she shall be bound by the vow:
<br> 
<br>Whatsoever she promised and swore, she shall fulfil in deed.
<br>But if her father, immediately as soon as he heard it, gainsaid it, both her vows and her oaths shall be void, neither shall she be bound to what she promised, because her father hath gainsaid it.
<br>If she have a husband, and shall vow any thing, and the word once going out of her mouth shall bind her soul by an oath,
<br>The day that her husband shall hear it, and not gainsay it, she shall be bound to the vow, and shall give whatsoever she promised.
<br>But if as soon as he heareth he gainsay it, and make her promises and the words wherewith she had bound her soul of no effect: the Lord will forgive her.
<br>The widow, and she that is divorced, shall fulfil whatsoever they vow.
<br>If the wife in the house of her husband, hath bound herself by vow and by oath,
<br>If her husband hear, and hold his peace, and doth not disallow the promise, she shall ac- complish whatsoever she had promised.
<br>But if forthwith he gainsay it, she shall not be bound by the promise: because her husband gainsaid it, and the Lord will be merciful to her. 14 If she vow and bind herself by oath, to af- flict her soul by fasting, or abstinence from other things, it shall depend on the will of her husband,
<br>whether she shall do it, or not do it.
<br>But if the husband hearing it hold his peace, and defer the declaring his mind till another day: whatsoever she had vowed and promised, she shall fulfil: because immediately as he heard it, he held his peace.
<br>But if he gainsay it after that he knew it, he shall bear her iniquity.
<br>These are the laws which the Lord ap- pointed to Moses between the husband and the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>wife, between the father and the daughter that is as yet but a girl in age, or that abideth in her fatherâ€™s house.
<br>
<br>Chapter 31
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>Revenge first the children of Israel on the Madianites, and so thou shalt be gathered to thy people.
<br>And Moses forthwith said: Arm of you men to fight, who may take the revenge of the Lord on the Madianites.
<br>Let a thousand men be chosen out of every tribe of Israel to be sent to the war.
<br>And they gave a thousand of every tribe, that is to say, twelve thousand men well ap- pointed for battle.
<br>And Moses sent them with Phinees the son of Eleazar the priest, and he delivered to him the holy vessels, and the trumpets to sound.
<br>And when they had fought against the Ma- dianites and had overcome them, they slew all the men.
<br>And their kings Evi, and Recem, and Sur, and Hur, and Rebe, five princes of the nation: Balaam also the son of Beor they killed with the sword.
<br>And they took their women, and their chil- dren captives, and all their cattle, and all their goods: and all their possessions they plundered: 10 And all their cities, and their villages, and
<br>castles, they burned.
<br>And they carried away the booty, and all that they had taken both of men and of beasts.
<br>And they brought them to Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and to all the multitude of the children of Israel. But the rest of the things for use they carried to the camp on the plains of
<br> 
<br>Moab, beside the Jordan over against Jericho.
<br>And Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the princes of the synagogue went forth to meet them without the camp.
<br>And Moses being angry with the chief offi- cers of the army, the tribunes, and the centurions that were come from the battle,
<br>Said: Why have you saved the women?
<br>Are not these they, that deceived the chil- dren of Israel by the counsel of Balaam, and made you transgress against the Lord by the sin of Phogor, for which also the people was pun- ished?
<br>Therefore kill all that are of the male sex, even of the children: and put to death the women, that have carnally known men.
<br>But the girls, and all the women that are virgins save for yourselves:
<br>And stay without the camp seven days. He that hath killed a man, or touched one that is killed, shall be purified the third day and the seventh day.
<br>And of all the spoil, every garment, or ves- sel, or any thing made for use, of the skins, or hair of goats, or of wood, shall be purified.
<br>Eleazar also the priest spoke to the men of the army, that had fought, in this manner: This is the ordinance of the law, which the Lord hath commanded Moses:
<br>Gold, and silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin,
<br>And all that may pass through the fire, shall be purified by fire, but whatsoever cannot abide the fire, shall be sanctified with the water of expiation:
<br>And you shall wash your garments the sev- enth day, and being purified, you shall after- wards enter into the camp.
<br>And the Lord said to Moses:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Take the sum of the things that were taken both of man and beast, thou and Eleazar the priest and the princes of the multitude:
<br>And thou shalt divide the spoil equally, between them that fought and went out to the war, and between the rest of the multitude.
<br>And thou shalt separate a portion to the Lord from them that fought and were in the bat- tle, one soul of five hundred as well of persons as of oxen and asses and sheep.
<br>And thou shalt give it to Eleazar the priest, because they are the firstfruits of the Lord.
<br>Out of the moiety also of the children of Israel thou shalt take the fiftieth head of persons, and of oxen, and asses, and sheep, and of all beasts, and thou shalt give them to the Levites that watch in the charge of the tabernacle of the Lord.
<br>And Moses and Eleazar did as the Lord had commanded.
<br>And the spoil which the army had taken, was six hundred seventy-five thousand sheep,
<br>Seventy-two thousand oxen,
<br>Sixty-one thousand asses:
<br>And thirty-two thousand persons of the fe- male sex, that had not known men.
<br>And one half was given to them that had been in the battle, to wit, three hundred thirty- seven thousand five hundred sheep:
<br>Out of which, for the portion of the Lord, were reckoned six hundred seventy five sheep.
<br>And out of the thirty-six thousand oxen, seventy-two oxen:
<br>Out of the thirty thousand five hundred asses, sixty-one asses:
<br>Out of the sixteen thousand persons, there fell to the portion of the Lord, thirty-two souls.
<br>And Moses delivered the number of the firstfruits of the Lord to Eleazar the priest, as had been commanded him,
<br> 
<br>Out of the half of the children of Israel, which he had separated for them that had been in the battle.
<br>But out of the half that fell to the rest of the multitude, that is to say, out of the three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hun- dred sheep,
<br>And out of the thirty-six thousand oxen,
<br>And out of the thirty thousand five hun- dred asses,
<br>And out of the sixteen thousand persons,
<br>Moses took the fiftieth head, and gave it to the Levites that watched in the tabernacle of the Lord, as the Lord had commanded.
<br>And when the commanders of the army, and the tribunes and centurions were come to Moses, they said:
<br>We thy servants have reckoned up the num- ber of the fighting men, whom we had under our hand, and not so much as one was wanting.
<br>Therefore we offer as gifts to the Lord what gold every one of us could find in the booty, in garters and tablets, rings and bracelets, and chains, that thou mayst pray to the Lord for us. 51 And Moses and Eleazar the priest received
<br>all the gold in divers kinds,
<br>In weight sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty sicles, from the tribunes and from the centurions.
<br>For that which every one had taken in the booty was his own.
<br>And that which was received they brought into the tabernacle of the testimony, for a memo- rial of the children of Israel before the Lord.
<br>
<br>Chapter 32
<br>And the sons of Ruben and Gad had many flocks of cattle, and their substance in beasts was infi-
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>nite. And when they saw the lands of Jazer and Galaad fit for feeding cattle,
<br>They came to Moses and Eleazar the priest, and the princes of the multitude, and said:
<br>Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nemra, Hesebon, and Eleale, and Saban, and Nebo, and Beon,
<br>The land, which the Lord hath conquered in the sight of the children of Israel, is a very fertile soil for the feeding of beasts: and we thy servants have very much cattle:
<br>And we pray thee, if we have found favour in thy sight, that thou give it to us thy servants in possession, and make us not pass over the Jor- dan.
<br>And Moses answered them: What, shall your brethren go to fight, and will you sit here? 7 Why do ye overturn the minds of the chil- dren of Israel, that they may not dare to pass into the place which the Lord hath given them? 8 Was it not thus your fathers did, when I sent
<br>from Cadesbarne to view the land?
<br>And when they were come as far as the valley of the cluster, having viewed all the country, they overturned the hearts of the children of Israel, that they should not enter into the coasts, which the Lord gave them.
<br>And he swore in his anger, saying:
<br>If these men, that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land, which I promised with an oath to Abra- ham, Isaac, and Jacob: because they would not follow me,
<br>Except Caleb the son of Jephone the Cenezite, and Josue the son of Nun: these have fulfilled my will.
<br>And the Lord being angry against Israel, led them about through the desert forty years, until the whole generation, that had done evil in his sight, was consumed.
<br> 
<br>And behold, said he, you are risen up in- stead of your fathers, the increase and offspring of sinful men, to augment the fury of the Lord against Israel.
<br>For if you will not follow him, he will leave the people in the wilderness, and you shall be the cause of the destruction of all.
<br>But they coming near, said: We will make sheepfolds, and stalls for our cattle, and strong cities for our children:
<br>And we ourselves will go armed and ready for battle before the children of Israel, until we bring them in unto their places. Our little ones, and all we have, shall be in walled cities, for fear of the ambushes of the inhabitants.
<br>We will not return into our houses until the children of Israel possess their inheritance:
<br>Neither will we seek any thing beyond the Jordan, because we have already our possession on the east side thereof,
<br>And Moses said to them: If you do what you promise, go on well appointed for war before the Lord:
<br>And let every fighting man pass over the Jordan, until the Lord overthrow his enemies:
<br>And all the land be brought under him, then shall you be blameless before the Lord and before Israel, and you shall obtain the countries that you desire, before the Lord.
<br>But if you do not what you say, no man can doubt but you sin against God: and know ye, that your sin shall overtake you.
<br>Build therefore cities for your children, and folds and stalls for your sheep and beasts, and accomplish what you have promised.
<br>And the children of Gad and Ruben said to Moses: We are thy servants, we will do what my lord commandeth.
<br>We will leave our children, and our wives and sheep and cattle, in the cities of Galaad:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>And we thy servants all well appointed will march on to the war, as thou, my lord, speakest. 28 Moses therefore commanded Eleazar the priest, and Josue the son of Nun, and the princes of the families of all the tribes of Israel, and said
<br>to them:
<br>29 If the children of Gad, and the children of Ruben pass with you over the Jordan, all armed for war before the Lord, and the land be made subject to you: give them Galaad in possession. 30 But if they will not pass armed with you into the land of Chanaan, let them receive places
<br>to dwell in among you.
<br>And the children of Gad, and the children of Ruben answered: As the Lord hath spoken to his servants, so will we do:
<br>We will go armed before the Lord into the land of Chanaan, and we confess that we have already received our possession beyond the Jor- dan.
<br>Moses therefore gave to the children of Gad and of Ruben, and to the half tribe of Manasses the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sehon king of the Amorrhites, and the kingdom of Og king of Basan, and their land and the cities thereof round about.
<br>And the sons of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,
<br>And Etroth, and Sophan, and Jazer, and Jegbaa,
<br>And Bethnemra, and Betharan, fenced cities, and folds for their cattle.
<br>But the children of Ruben built Hesebon, and Eleale, and Cariathaim,
<br>And Nabo, and Baalmeon (their names be- ing changed) and Sabama: giving names to the cities which they had built.
<br>Moreover the children of Machir, the son of Manasses, went into Galaad, and wasted it, cut- ting off the Amorrhites, the inhabitants thereof.
<br> 
<br>And Moses gave the land of Galaad to Machir the son of Manasses, and he dwelt in it. 41 And  Jair the  son of Manasses went, and took the villages thereof, and he called them
<br>Havoth Jair, that is to say, the villages of Jair.
<br>42 Nobe also went, and took Canath with the villages thereof: and he called it by his own name, Nobe.
<br>
<br>Chapter 33
<br>These are the mansions of the children of Israel, who went out of Egypt by their troops under the conduct of Moses and Aaron,
<br>Which Moses wrote down according to the places of their encamping, which they changed by the commandment of the Lord.
<br>Now the children of Israel departed from Ramesses the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month, the day after the phase, with a mighty hand, in the sight of all the Egyptians, 4 Who were burying their firstborn, whom the Lord had slain (upon their gods also he had ex-
<br>ecuted vengeance,)
<br>And they camped in Soccoth.
<br>And from Soccoth they came into Etham, which is in the uttermost borders of the wilder- ness.
<br>Departing from thence they came over against Phihahiroth, which looketh towards Beelsephon, and they camped before Magdalum.
<br>And departing from Phihahiroth, they passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness: and having marched three days through the desert of Etham, they camped in Mara.
