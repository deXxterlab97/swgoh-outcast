<br>SUBCHAPTER II—SMALL BUSINESS CAPITAL ENHANCEMENT
<br>§4741. Findings and purposes
<br>(a) Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) small business concerns are a vital part of the economy, accounting for the majority of new jobs, new products, and new services created in the United States;
<br>
<br>(2) adequate access to debt capital is a critical component for small business development, productivity, expansion, and success in the United States;
<br>
<br>(3) commercial banks are the most important suppliers of debt capital to small business concerns in the United States;
<br>
<br>(4) commercial banks and other depository institutions have various incentives to minimize their risk in financing small business concerns;
<br>
<br>(5) as a result of such incentives, many small business concerns with economically sound financing needs are unable to obtain access to needed debt capital;
<br>
<br>(6) the small business capital access programs implemented by certain States are a flexible and efficient tool to assist financial institutions in providing access to needed debt capital for many small business concerns in a manner consistent with safety and soundness regulations;
<br>
<br>(7) a small business capital access program would complement other programs which assist small business concerns in obtaining access to capital; and
<br>
<br>(8) Federal policy can stimulate and accelerate efforts by States to implement small business capital access programs by providing an incentive to States, while leaving the administration of such programs to each participating State.
<br>(b) Purposes
<br>
<br>By encouraging States to implement administratively efficient capital access programs that encourage commercial banks and other depository institutions to provide access to debt capital for a broad portfolio of small business concerns, and thereby promote a more efficient and effective debt market, the purposes of this subchapter are—
<br>
<br>(1) to promote economic opportunity and growth;
<br>
<br>(2) to create jobs;
<br>
<br>(3) to promote economic efficiency;
<br>
<br>(4) to enhance productivity; and
<br>
<br>(5) to spur innovation.

The Secretary may issue guidelines that will apply to new capital investments limiting the amount of capital available to eligible institutions consistent with this limitation.
<br>
<br>"(G) Rate adjustments for s corporation.—Before making a capital investment in an eligible institution that is an S corporation or a corporation organized on a mutual basis, the Secretary may adjust the dividend or interest rate on the financial instrument to be issued to the Secretary, from the dividend or interest rate that would apply under subparagraphs (A) through (F), to take into account any differential tax treatment of securities issued by such eligible institution.

<br>
<br>"(ii) provides that the term and condition described under clause (i) shall not apply if the application of that term and condition would adversely affect the capital treatment of the stock or financial instrument under current or successor applicable capital provisions compared to a capital instrument with identical terms other than the term and condition described under clause (i).

<br>(1) a specific department or agency of the State has been designated to implement the Program;
<br>
<br>(2) all legal actions necessary to enable such designated department or agency to implement the Program have been accomplished;
<br>
<br>(3) funds in the amount of at least $1 for every 2 people residing in the State (as of the last decennial census for which data have been released) are available and have been legally committed to contributions by the State to reserve funds, with such funds being available without time limit and without requiring additional legal action, except that such requirements shall not be construed to limit the authority of the State to take action at a later time that results in the termination of its obligation to enroll loans and make contributions to reserve funds;

<br>
<br>(5) the State and the Fund have executed a reimbursement agreement that conforms to the requirements of this subchapter.
<br>(c) Existing State programs
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>A State that is not a participating State, but that has its own capital access program providing portfolio insurance for business loans (based on a separate loss reserve fund for each financial institution), may apply at any time to the Fund to be approved to be a participating State. The Fund shall approve such State to be a participating State, and to be eligible for reimbursements by the Fund pursuant to section 4747 of this title, if the State—
<br>
<br>(A) satisfies the requirements of subsections (a) and (b); and
<br>
<br>(B) certifies that each affected financial institution has satisfied the requirements of section 4744 of this title.
<br>(2) Applicable terms of participation
<br>(A) Status of institutions
<br>
<br>If a State is approved for participation under paragraph (1), each financial institution with a participation agreement in effect with the participating State shall immediately be considered a participating financial institution. Reimbursements may be made under section 4747 1 of this title in connection with all contributions made to the reserve fund by the State in connection with lending that occurs on or after the date on which the Fund approves the State for participation.
<br>(B) Effective date of participation
<br>
<br>If an amended participation agreement that conforms with section 4745 of this title is required in order to secure participation approval by the Fund, contributions subject to reimbursement under section 4747 of this title shall include only those contributions made to a reserve fund with respect to loans enrolled on or after the date that an amended participation agreement between the participating State and the participating financial institution becomes effective.
<br>(C) Use of accumulated reserve funds
<br>
<br>A State that is approved for participation in accordance with this subsection may continue to implement the program 2 utilizing the reserve funds accumulated under the State program.
<br>(d) Prior appropriations requirement
<br>
<br>The Fund shall not approve a State for participation in the Program until at least $50,000,000 has been appropriated to the Fund (subject to an appropriations Act), without fiscal year limitation, for the purpose of making reimbursements pursuant to section 4747 of this title and otherwise carrying out this subchapter.
<br>(e) Amendments to agreements
<br>
<br>If a State that has been approved to be a participating State wishes to amend its form of participation agreement and continue to be a participating State, such State shall submit such amendment for review by the Fund in accordance with subsection (b)(4). Any such amendment shall become effective only after it has been approved by the Fund.

<br>
<br>The participation agreement to be entered into by a participating State and a participating financial institution shall include all provisions required by this section, and shall not include any provisions inconsistent with the provisions of this section.
<br>(b) Establishment of separate reserve funds
<br>
<br>A separate reserve fund shall be established by the participating State for each participating financial institution. All funds credited to a reserve fund shall be the exclusive property of the participating State. Each reserve fund shall be an administrative account for the purposes of—

<br>The participation agreement shall require that the items required by this subsection shall be submitted to the participating State by the participating financial institutions not later than 10 calendar days after a loan is made.
<br>(2) Enrollment by State
<br>
<br>Upon receipt by the participating State of the filing submitted in accordance with paragraph (1), the participating State shall promptly enroll the loan and make a matching contribution to the reserve fund in accordance with subsection (j), unless the information submitted indicates that the participating financial institution has not complied with the participation agreement in enrolling the loan.
<br>(g) Coverage amount
<br>
<br>In filing a loan for enrollment under the Program, the participating financial institution may specify an amount to be covered under the Program that is less than the full amount of the loan.
<br>(h) Premium charges
<br>(1) Minimum and maximum amounts
<br>
<br>The premium charges payable to the reserve fund by the borrower and the participating financial institution shall be prescribed by the participating financial institution, within minimum and maximum limits set forth in the participation agreement. The participation agreement shall establish minimum and maximum limits whereby the sum of the premium charges paid in connection with a loan by the borrower and the participating financial institution is not less than 3 percent nor more than 7 percent of the amount of the loan covered under the Program.
<br>(2) Allocation of premium charges
<br>
<br>The participation agreement shall specify terms for allocating premium charges between the borrower and the participating financial institution. However, if the participating financial institution is required to pay any of the premium charges, the participation agreement shall authorize the participating financial institution to recover from the borrower the cost of the payment of the participating financial institution, in any manner on which the participating financial institution and the borrower agree.
<br>(i) Restrictions
<br>(1) Actions prohibited
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subsection (h) and paragraph (2) of this subsection, the participating State may not—
<br>
<br>(A) impose any restrictions or requirements, relating to the interest rate, fees, collateral, or other business terms and conditions of the loan; or
<br>
<br>(B) condition enrollment of a loan in the Program on the review by the State of the risk or creditworthiness of a loan.

<br>(2) Timing
<br>
<br>Any claim filed under paragraph (1) shall be filed contemporaneously with the action of the participating financial institution to charge off all or part of an enrolled loan. The participating financial institution shall determine when and how much to charge off on an enrolled loan, in a manner consistent with its usual method for making such determinations on business loans that are not enrolled loans under this subchapter.
<br>(l) Elements of claims
<br>
<br>A claim filed by a participating financial institution may include the amount of principal charged off, not to exceed the covered amount of the loan. Such claim may also include accrued interest and out-of-pocket expenses, if and to the extent provided for under the participation agreement.
<br>(m) Payment of claims
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subsection (n) and paragraph (2) of this subsection, upon receipt of a claim filed in accordance with this section and the participation agreement, the participating State shall promptly pay to the participating financial institution, from funds in the reserve fund, the full amount of the claim as submitted.
<br>(2) Insufficient reserve funds
<br>
<br>If there are insufficient funds in the reserve fund to cover the entire amount of a claim of a participating financial institution, the participating State shall pay to the participating financial institution an amount equal to the current balance in the reserve fund. If the enrolled loan for which the claim has been filed—
<br>
<br>(A) is not an early loan, such payment shall be deemed fully to satisfy the claim, and the participating financial institution shall have no other or further right to receive any amount from the reserve fund with respect to such claim; or
<br>
<br>(B) is an early loan, such payment shall not be deemed fully to satisfy the claim of the participating financial institution, and at such time as the remaining balance of the claim does not exceed 75 percent of the balance in the reserve fund, the participating State shall, upon the request of the participating financial institution, pay any remaining amount of the claim.
<br>(n) Denial of claims
<br>
<br>A participating State may deny a claim if a representation or warranty made by the participating financial institution to the participating State at the time that the loan was filed for enrollment or at the time that the claim was submitted was known by the participating financial institution to be false.
<br>(o) Subsequent recovery of claim amount
<br>
<br>If, subsequent to payment of a claim by the participating State, a participating financial institution recovers from a borrower any amount for which payment of the claim was made, the participating financial institution shall promptly pay to the participating State for deposit into the reserve fund the amount recovered, less any expenses incurred by the institution in collection of such amount.
<br>(p) Participation agreement terms
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>In connection with the filing of a loan for enrollment in the Program, the participation agreement—
<br>
<br>(A) shall require the participating financial institution to obtain an assurance from each borrower that—
<br>
<br>(i) the proceeds of the loan will be used for a business purpose;
<br>
<br>(ii) the loan will not be used to finance passive real estate ownership; and
<br>
<br>(iii) the borrower is not—
<br>
<br>(I) an executive officer, director, or principal shareholder of the participating financial institution;
<br>
<br>(II) a member of the immediate family of an executive officer, director, or principal shareholder of the participating financial institution; or
<br>
<br>(III) a related interest of any such executive officer, director, principal shareholder, or member of the immediate family;
<br>
<br>(B) shall require the participating financial institution to provide assurances to the participating State that the loan has not been made in order to place under the protection of the Program prior debt that is not covered under the Program and that is or was owed by the borrower to the participating financial institution or to an affiliate of the participating financial institution;
<br>
<br>(C) may provide that if—
<br>
<br>(i) a participating financial institution makes a loan to a borrower that is a refinancing of a loan previously made to the borrower by the participating financial institution or an affiliate of the participating financial institution;
<br>
<br>(ii) such prior loan was not enrolled in the Program; and
<br>
<br>(iii) additional or new financing is extended by the participating financial institution as part of the refinancing,
<br>
<br>the participating financial institution may file the loan for enrollment, with the amount to be covered under the Program not to exceed the amount of any additional or new financing; and
<br>
<br>(D) may include additional restrictions on the eligibility of loans or borrowers that are not inconsistent with the provisions and purposes of this subchapter.
<br>(2) Definitions
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subsection, the terms "executive officer", "director", "principal shareholder", "immediate family", and "related interest" refer to the same relationship to a participating financial institution as the relationship described in part 215 of title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor to such part.
<br>(q) Termination clause
<br>
<br>In each participation agreement, the participating State shall reserve for itself the ability to terminate its obligation to enroll loans under the Program. Any such termination shall be prospective only, and shall not apply to amounts of loans enrolled under the Program prior to such termination.
<br>(r) Allowable withdrawals from fund
<br>
<br>The participation agreement may provide that, if, for any consecutive period of not less than 24 months, the aggregate outstanding balance of all enrolled loans for a participating financial institution is continually less than the outstanding balance in the reserve fund for that participating financial institution, the participating State, in its discretion, may withdraw an amount from the reserve fund to bring the balance in the reserve fund down to the outstanding balance of all such enrolled loans.
<br>(s) Grandfathered provision
<br>(1) Special treatment of premium charges
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding subsection (b) or (d), the participation agreement, if explicitly authorized by a statute enacted by the State before September 23, 1994, may allow a participating financial institution to treat the premium charges paid by the participating financial institution and the borrower into the reserve fund, and interest or income earned on funds in the reserve fund that are deemed to be attributable to such premium charges, as assets of the participating financial institution for accounting purposes, subject to withdrawal by the participating financial institution only—
<br>
<br>(A) for the payment of claims approved by the participating State in accordance with this section; and
<br>
<br>(B) upon the participating financial institution's withdrawal from authority to make new loans under the Program.
<br>(2) Payment of post-withdrawal claims
<br>
<br>After any withdrawal of assets from the reserve fund pursuant to paragraph (1)(B), any future claims filed by the participating financial institution on loans remaining in its capital access program portfolio shall only be paid from funds remaining in the reserve fund to the extent that, in the aggregate, such claims exceed the sum of the amount of such withdrawn assets, and interest on that amount, imputed at the same rate as income would have accrued had the amount not been withdrawn.
<br>(3) Conditions for terminating special authority
<br>
<br>If the Fund determines that the inclusion in a participation agreement of the provisions authorized by this subsection is resulting in the enrollment of loans under the Program that are likely to have been made without assistance provided under this subchapter, the Fund may notify the participating State that henceforth, the Fund will only make reimbursements to the State under section 4747 of this title with respect to a loan if the participation agreement between the participating State and each participating financial institution has been amended to conform with this section, without exercise of the special authority granted by this subsection.
<br>

<br>(2) by applying subsection (e) to the balance of the loan.
<br>

<br>
<br>(1) by 2; and
<br>
<br>(2) by the total amount of contributions made by the participating State to all reserve funds, including if applicable, contributions that have been made by the State prior to becoming a participating State if the State continued its own capital access program in accordance with section 4743(b) of this title.
