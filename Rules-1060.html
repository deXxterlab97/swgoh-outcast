<br>(1) Students' personally identifiable information is important to protect.
<br>
<br>(2) Students' information should not be shared with individuals other than school officials in charge of educating those students without clear notice to parents.
<br>
<br>(3) With the use of more technology, and more research about student learning, the responsibility to protect students' personally identifiable information is more important than ever.
<br>
<br>(4) Regulations allowing more access to students' personal information could allow that information to be shared or sold by individuals who do not have the best interest of the students in mind.
<br>
<br>(5) The Secretary has the responsibility to ensure every entity that receives funding under this chapter holds any personally identifiable information in strict confidence.
<br>(b) Sense of Congress
<br>
<br>It is the sense of the Congress that the Secretary should review all regulations addressing issues of student privacy, including those under this chapter, and ensure that students' personally identifiable information is protected.

<br>
<br>A State, State educational agency, or local educational agency in the case of a local educational agency that receives Federal funds under this chapter shall have laws, regulations, or policies that prohibit any individual who is a school employee, contractor, or agent, or any State educational agency or local educational agency, from assisting a school employee, contractor, or agent in obtaining a new job, apart from the routine transmission of administrative and personnel files, if the individual or agency knows, or has probable cause to believe, that such school employee, contractor, or agent engaged in sexual misconduct regarding a minor or student in violation of the law.
<br>(b) Exception
<br>
<br>The requirements of subsection (a) shall not apply if the information giving rise to probable cause—
<br>
<br>(1)(A) has been properly reported to a law enforcement agency with jurisdiction over the alleged misconduct; and
<br>
<br>(B) has been properly reported to any other authorities as required by Federal, State, or local law, including title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.) and the regulations implementing such title under part 106 of title 34, Code of Federal Regulations, or any succeeding regulations; and
<br>
<br>(2)(A) the matter has been officially closed or the prosecutor or police with jurisdiction over the alleged misconduct has investigated the allegations and notified school officials that there is insufficient information to establish probable cause that the school employee, contractor, or agent engaged in sexual misconduct regarding a minor or student in violation of the law;
<br>
<br>(B) the school employee, contractor, or agent has been charged with, and acquitted or otherwise exonerated of the alleged misconduct; or
<br>

<br>
<br>The Secretary shall not have the authority to mandate, direct, or control the specific measures adopted by a State, State educational agency, or local educational agency under this section.
<br>(d) Construction
<br>
<br>Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent a State from adopting, or to override a State law, regulation, or policy that provides, greater or additional protections to prohibit any individual who is a school employee, contractor, or agent, or any State educational agency or local educational agency, from assisting a school employee who engaged in sexual misconduct regarding a minor or student in violation of the law in obtaining a new job.

<br>It is the Sense of the Congress that a State retains the right to make decisions, free from Federal intrusion, concerning its system of early learning and child care, and whether or not to use funding under this chapter to offer early childhood education programs. Such systems should continue to include robust choice for parents through a mixed delivery system of services so parents can determine the right early learning and child care option for their children. States, while protecting the rights of early learning and child care providers, retain the right to make decisions that shall include the age at which to set compulsory attendance in school, the content of a State's early learning guidelines, and how to determine quality in programs.

<br>The provisions of paragraph (2) shall also apply to the provision of such routine or regular kindergarten, elementary or secondary education or library services in the facilities described in paragraph (2) not subject to paragraph (1).
<br>(d) Notice
<br>
<br>The prohibitions in subsections (a) through (c) shall be published in a notice in the Federal Register by the Secretary (in consultation with the heads of other affected agencies) and by such agency heads in funding arrangements involving the provision of children's services administered by such heads. Such prohibitions shall be effective 90 days after such notice is published, or 270 days after January 8, 2002, whichever occurs first.
<br>(e) Civil penalties
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Any failure to comply with a prohibition in this section shall be considered to be a violation of this section and any person subject to such prohibition who commits such violation may be liable to the United States for a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed $1,000 for each violation, or may be subject to an administrative compliance order, or both, as determined by the Secretary. Each day a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation. In the case of any civil penalty assessed under this section, the total amount shall not exceed 50 percent of the amount of Federal funds received under any subchapter of this chapter by such person for the fiscal year in which the continuing violation occurred. For the purpose of the prohibition in subsection (c), the term "person", as used in this paragraph, shall mean the head of the applicable Federal agency or the contractor of such agency providing the services to children.
<br>(2) Administrative proceeding
<br>
<br>A civil penalty may be assessed in a written notice, or an administrative compliance order may be issued under paragraph (1), by the Secretary only after an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with section 554 of title 5. Before making such assessment or issuing such order, or both, the Secretary shall give written notice of the assessment or order to such person by certified mail with return receipt and provide information in the notice of an opportunity to request in writing, not later than 30 days after the date of receipt of such notice, such hearing. The notice shall reasonably describe the violation and be accompanied with the procedures for such hearing and a simple form that may be used to request such hearing if such person desires to use such form. If a hearing is requested, the Secretary shall establish by such certified notice the time and place for such hearing, which shall be located, to the greatest extent possible, at a location convenient to such person. The Secretary (or the Secretary's designee) and such person may consult to arrange a suitable date and location where appropriate.
<br>(3) Circumstances affecting penalty or order
<br>
<br>In determining the amount of the civil penalty or the nature of the administrative compliance order, the Secretary shall take into account, as appropriate—
<br>
<br>(A) the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation;
<br>
<br>(B) with respect to the violator, any good faith efforts to comply, the importance of achieving early and permanent compliance, the ability to pay or comply, the effect of the penalty or order on the ability to continue operation, any prior history of the same kind of violation, the degree of culpability, and any demonstration of willingness to comply with the prohibitions of this section in a timely manner; and
<br>
<br>(C) such other matters as justice may require.
<br>(4) Modification
<br>
<br>The Secretary may, as appropriate, compromise, modify, or remit, with or without conditions, any civil penalty or administrative compliance order. In the case of a civil penalty, the amount, as finally determined by the Secretary or agreed upon in compromise, may be deducted from any sums that the United States or the agencies or instrumentalities of the United States owe to the person against whom the penalty is assessed.
<br>(5) Petition for review
<br>
<br>Any person aggrieved by a penalty assessed or an order issued, or both, by the Secretary under this section may file a petition for judicial review of the order with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit or for any other circuit in which the person resides or transacts business. Such person shall provide a copy of the petition to the Secretary or the Secretary's designee. The petition shall be filed within 30 days after the Secretary's assessment or order, or both, are final and have been provided to such person by certified mail. The Secretary shall promptly provide to the court a certified copy of the transcript of any hearing held under this section and a copy of the notice or order.
