<br>
<br>(ii) The amounts in the Deficit Reduction Fund as set forth in subsection (b) that result from increases in total revenues and spending reductions shall not be available for new spending or to finance measures that increase the deficit for purposes of budget enforcement procedures under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (2 U.S.C. 901–922 [900–922]).
<br>
<br>(d) Effect on Other Funds. Establishment of and transfers to the Deficit Reduction Fund shall not affect trust fund transfers that may be authorized or required by provisions of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993 or any other provision of law.

<br>Within 15 calendar days after Congress adjourns to end a session there shall be a sequestration to eliminate a budget-year breach, if any, within any category.
<br>(2) Eliminating a breach
<br>
<br>Each non-exempt account within a category shall be reduced by a dollar amount calculated by multiplying the enacted level of sequestrable budgetary resources in that account at that time by the uniform percentage necessary to eliminate a breach within that category.
<br>(3) Military personnel
<br>
<br>If the President uses the authority to exempt any personnel account from sequestration under section 905(f) of this title, each account within subfunctional category 051 (other than those military personnel accounts for which the authority provided under section 905(f) of this title has been exercised) shall be further reduced by a dollar amount calculated by multiplying the enacted level of non-exempt budgetary resources in that account at that time by the uniform percentage necessary to offset the total dollar amount by which outlays are not reduced in military personnel accounts by reason of the use of such authority.
<br>(4) Part-year appropriations
<br>
<br>If, on the date specified in paragraph (1), there is in effect an Act making or continuing appropriations for part of a fiscal year for any budget account, then the dollar sequestration calculated for that account under paragraphs (2) and (3) shall be subtracted from—
<br>
<br>(A) the annualized amount otherwise available by law in that account under that or a subsequent part-year appropriation; and
<br>
<br>(B) when a full-year appropriation for that account is enacted, from the amount otherwise provided by the full-year appropriation for that account.
<br>(5) Look-back
<br>
<br>If, after June 30, an appropriation for the fiscal year in progress is enacted that causes a breach within a category for that year (after taking into account any sequestration of amounts within that category), the discretionary spending limits for that category for the next fiscal year shall be reduced by the amount or amounts of that breach.
<br>(6) Within-session sequestration
<br>
<br>If an appropriation for a fiscal year in progress is enacted (after Congress adjourns to end the session for that budget year and before July 1 of that fiscal year) that causes a breach within a category for that year (after taking into account any prior sequestration of amounts within that category), 15 days later there shall be a sequestration to eliminate that breach within that category following the procedures set forth in paragraphs (2) through (4).
<br>(7) Estimates
<br>(A) CBO estimates
<br>
<br>As soon as practicable after Congress completes action on any discretionary appropriation, CBO, after consultation with the Committees on the Budget of the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall provide OMB with an estimate of the amount of discretionary new budget authority and outlays for the current year, if any, and the budget year provided by that legislation.
<br>(B) OMB estimates and explanation of differences
<br>
<br>Not later than 7 calendar days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) after the date of enactment of any discretionary appropriation, OMB shall transmit a report to the House of Representatives and to the Senate containing both the CBO and OMB estimates of the amount of discretionary new budget authority for the current year, if any, and the budget year provided by that legislation, and an explanation of any difference between the 2 estimates. If during the preparation of the report OMB determines that there is a significant difference between OMB and CBO, OMB shall consult with the Committees on the Budget of the House of Representatives and the Senate regarding that difference and that consultation shall include, to the extent practicable, written communication to those committees that affords such committees the opportunity to comment before the issuance of the report.
<br>(C) Assumptions and guidelines
<br>
<br>OMB estimates under this paragraph shall be made using current economic and technical assumptions. OMB shall use the OMB estimates transmitted to the Congress under this paragraph. OMB and CBO shall prepare estimates under this paragraph in conformance with scorekeeping guidelines determined after consultation among the Committees on the Budget of the House of Representatives and the Senate, CBO, and OMB.
<br>(D) Annual appropriations
<br>
<br>For purposes of this paragraph, amounts provided by annual appropriations shall include any discretionary appropriations for the current year, if any, and the budget year in accounts for which funding is provided in that legislation that result from previously enacted legislation.
<br>(b) Adjustments to discretionary spending limits
<br>(1) Concepts and definitions
<br>
<br>When the President submits the budget under section 1105 of title 31, OMB shall calculate and the budget shall include adjustments to discretionary spending limits (and those limits as cumulatively adjusted) for the budget year and each outyear to reflect changes in concepts and definitions. Such changes shall equal the baseline levels of new budget authority and outlays using up-to-date concepts and definitions, minus those levels using the concepts and definitions in effect before such changes. Such changes may only be made after consultation with the Committees on Appropriations and the Budget of the House of Representatives and the Senate, and that consultation shall include written communication to such committees that affords such committees the opportunity to comment before official action is taken with respect to such changes.
<br>(2) Sequestration reports
<br>
<br>When OMB submits a sequestration report under section 904(e), (f), or (g) of this title for a fiscal year, OMB shall calculate, and the sequestration report and subsequent budgets submitted by the President under section 1105(a) of title 31 shall include 1 adjustments to discretionary spending limits (and those limits as adjusted) for the fiscal year and each succeeding year, as follows:
<br>(A) Emergency appropriations; overseas contingency operations/global war on terrorism
<br>
<br>If, for any fiscal year, appropriations for discretionary accounts are enacted that—
<br>
<br>(i) the Congress designates as emergency requirements in statute on an account by account basis and the President subsequently so designates, or
<br>
<br>(ii) the Congress designates for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism in statute on an account by account basis and the President subsequently so designates,

<br>OMB shall calculate the reduction to direct spending programs by taking the total reduction for nondefense functions required for that year under paragraph (2) and subtracting the discretionary reduction calculated pursuant to subparagraph (A).
<br>(5) Implementing discretionary reductions
<br>(A) Fiscal year 2013
<br>
<br>On March 1, 2013, for fiscal year 2013, OMB shall calculate and the President shall order a sequestration, effective upon issuance and under the procedures set forth in section 903(f) of this title, to reduce each account within the security category or nonsecurity category by a dollar amount calculated by multiplying the baseline level of budgetary resources in that account at that time by a uniform percentage necessary to achieve—
<br>
<br>(i) for the revised security category, an amount equal to the defense function discretionary reduction calculated pursuant to paragraph (3); and
<br>
<br>(ii) for the revised nonsecurity category, an amount equal to the nondefense function discretionary reduction calculated pursuant to paragraph (4).
<br>(B) Fiscal years 2014–2021
<br>
<br>Except as provided by paragraphs (10), (11), (12), and (13), on the date of the submission of its sequestration preview report for fiscal years 2014 through 2021 pursuant to section 904(c) of this title for each of fiscal years 2014 through 2021, OMB shall reduce the discretionary spending limit—
<br>
<br>(i) for the revised security category by the amount of the defense function discretionary reduction calculated pursuant to paragraph (3); and
<br>
<br>(ii) for the revised nonsecurity category by the amount of the nondefense function discretionary reduction calculated pursuant to paragraph (4).
<br>(6) Implementing direct spending reductions
<br>
<br>(A) On the date specified in paragraph (2) during each applicable year, OMB shall prepare and the President shall order a sequestration, effective upon issuance, of nonexempt direct spending to achieve the direct spending reduction calculated pursuant to paragraphs (3) and (4). When implementing the sequestration of direct spending pursuant to this paragraph, OMB shall follow the procedures specified in section 935 of this title, the exemptions specified in section 905 of this title, and the special rules specified in section 906 of this title, except that the percentage reduction for the Medicare programs specified in section 906(d) of this title shall not be more than 2 percent for a fiscal year.
<br>
<br>(B) On the dates OMB issues its sequestration preview reports for each of fiscal years 2022 through 2030, pursuant to section 904(c) of this title, the President shall order a sequestration, effective upon issuance such that—
<br>
<br>(i) the percentage reduction for nonexempt direct spending for the defense function is the same percent as the percentage reduction for nonexempt direct spending for the defense function for fiscal year 2021 calculated under paragraph (3)(B); and
<br>
<br>(ii) the percentage reduction for nonexempt direct spending for nondefense functions is the same percent as the percentage reduction for nonexempt direct spending for nondefense functions for fiscal year 2021 calculated under paragraph (4)(B).
<br>
<br>(C) Notwithstanding the 2 percent limit specified in subparagraph (A) for payments for the Medicare programs specified in section 906(d) of this title, the sequestration order of the President under such subparagraph for fiscal year 2030 shall be applied to such payments so that—
<br>
<br>(i) with respect to the first 6 months in which such order is effective for such fiscal year, the payment reduction shall be 4.0 percent; and
<br>
<br>(ii) with respect to the second 6 months in which such order is so effective for such fiscal year, the payment reduction shall be 0.0 percent.
<br>(7) Adjustment for Medicare
<br>
<br>If the percentage reduction for the Medicare programs would exceed 2 percent for a fiscal year in the absence of paragraph (6), OMB shall increase the reduction for all other discretionary appropriations and direct spending under paragraph (4) by a uniform percentage to a level sufficient to achieve the reduction required by paragraph (4) in the non-defense function.
<br>(8) Implementation of reductions
<br>
<br>Any reductions imposed under this section shall be implemented in accordance with section 906(k) of this title.
<br>(9) Report
<br>
<br>On the dates specified in paragraph (2), OMB shall submit a report to Congress containing information about the calculations required under this section, the adjusted discretionary spending limits, a listing of the reductions required for each nonexempt direct spending account, and any other data and explanations that enhance public understanding of this title 1 and actions taken under it.
<br>(10) Implementing direct spending reductions for fiscal years 2014 and 2015
<br>
<br>(A) OMB shall make the calculations necessary to implement the direct spending reductions calculated pursuant to paragraphs (3) and (4) without regard to the amendment made to section 901(c) of this title revising the discretionary spending limits for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013.

<br>§902. Enforcing pay-as-you-go
<br>(a) Purpose
<br>
<br>The purpose of this section is to assure that any legislation enacted before October 1, 2002, affecting direct spending or receipts that increases the deficit will trigger an offsetting sequestration.
<br>(b) Sequestration
<br>(1) Timing
<br>
<br>Not later than 15 calendar days after the date Congress adjourns to end a session and on the same day as a sequestration (if any) under section 901 or 903 of this title, there shall be a sequestration to offset the amount of any net deficit increase caused by all direct spending and receipts legislation enacted before October 1, 2002, as calculated under paragraph (2).
<br>(2) Calculation of deficit increase
<br>
<br>OMB shall calculate the amount of deficit increase or decrease by adding—
<br>
<br>(A) all OMB estimates for the budget year of direct spending and receipts legislation transmitted under subsection (d);
<br>
<br>(B) the estimated amount of savings in direct spending programs applicable to the budget year resulting from the prior year's sequestration under this section or section 903 of this title, if any, as published in OMB's final sequestration report for that prior year; and
<br>
<br>(C) any net deficit increase or decrease in the current year resulting from all OMB estimates for the current year of direct spending and receipts legislation transmitted under subsection (d) that were not reflected in the final OMB sequestration report for the current year.
<br>(c) Eliminating a deficit increase
<br>
<br>(1) The amount required to be sequestered in a fiscal year under subsection (b) shall be obtained from non-exempt direct spending accounts from actions taken in the following order:
<br>(A) First
<br>
<br>All reductions in automatic spending increases specified in section 906(a) 1 of this title shall be made.
<br>(B) Second
<br>
<br>If additional reductions in direct spending accounts are required to be made, the maximum reductions permissible under sections 906(b) of this title (guaranteed and direct student loans) and 906(c) 1 of this title (foster care and adoption assistance) shall be made.
<br>(C) Third
<br>
<br>(i) If additional reductions in direct spending accounts are required to be made, each remaining non-exempt direct spending account shall be reduced by the uniform percentage necessary to make the reductions in direct spending required by subsection (b); except that the medicare programs specified in section 906(d) of this title shall not be reduced by more than 4 percent and the uniform percentage applicable to all other direct spending programs under this paragraph shall be increased (if necessary) to a level sufficient to achieve the required reduction in direct spending.
<br>
<br>(ii) For purposes of determining reductions under clause (i), outlay reductions (as a result of sequestration of Commodity Credit Corporation commodity price support contracts in the fiscal year of a sequestration) that would occur in the following fiscal year shall be credited as outlay reductions in the fiscal year of the sequestration.
<br>
<br>(2) For purposes of this subsection, accounts shall be assumed to be at the level in the baseline.
<br>(d) Estimates
<br>(1) CBO estimates
<br>
<br>As soon as practicable after Congress completes action on any direct spending or receipts legislation, CBO shall provide an estimate to OMB of that legislation.
<br>(2) OMB estimates
<br>
<br>Not later than 7 calendar days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) after the date of enactment of any direct spending or receipts legislation, OMB shall transmit a report to the House of Representatives and to the Senate containing—
<br>
<br>(A) the CBO estimate of that legislation;
<br>
<br>(B) an OMB estimate of that legislation using current economic and technical assumptions; and
<br>
<br>(C) an explanation of any difference between the 2 estimates.
