<br>
<br>Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense
<br>
<br>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 301 of title 3, United States Code, I hereby delegate to you: (a) the functions and authority of the President contained in section 315 of title 32, United States Code, to permit a commissioned officer of the Regular Army or Regular Air Force to accept a commission in the Army National Guard or the Air National Guard, as the case may be, terminable at your discretion, without prejudicing his or her rank and without vacating his or her regular appointment; and (b) the functions and authority of the President contained in section 325 of title 32, United States Code, to authorize the service of an officer of the Army National Guard or the Air National Guard on active duty without relieving that officer from duty in the National Guard of his or her State, or of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, or the United States Virgin Islands, or the District of Columbia and to give such authorization in advance for the purpose of establishing the succession of command of a unit.
<br>
<br>This delegation of functions and authority supersedes and replaces the July 23, 2004, delegation to the Secretary of Defense of the functions and authority of the President contained in section 325 of title 32, United States Code.

<br>
<br>In subsection (a) the words "ceases to have the qualifications prescribed under section 300 of this title" are substituted for 32:154 (last 26 words of last par.), since it is implicit that a member who could not be paid would lose his federally recognized status (see JAGA 1953/9033, 3 Dec. 1953). The last 23 words of subsection (a) are inserted as a necessary implication of the rule stated in section 309(c) of this title.
<br>
<br>In subsection (b), the words "or warrant officer" are omitted, since section 101(9) of this title defines "officer" to include warrant officers. The word "detailed" is substituted for the word "appointed", since the filling of the positions involved is not appointment to an office in the constitutional sense. The word "commissioned" is inserted after the words "composed of", since the word "officer" alone, in 32:115, referred to a commissioned officer only (see opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Army (JAGA 1953/4078, 6 May 1953)). The words "who outrank him" are substituted for the words "senior in rank to the officer under investigation".
<br>
<br>In subsection (c), the opening clause is substituted for the words "such transfer". The words "his Federal recognition is withdrawn" are substituted for the words "shall terminate his federally recognized National Guard or Air National Guard status".
