<br>(F) increases the level of interracial tensions and strife within prisons and, upon release of perpetrators and victims, in the community at large.
<br>
<br>(15) The high incidence of prison rape has a significant effect on interstate commerce because it increases substantially—
<br>
<br>(A) the costs incurred by Federal, State, and local jurisdictions to administer their prison systems;
<br>
<br>(B) the incidence and spread of HIV, AIDS, tuberculosis, hepatitis B and C, and other diseases, contributing to increased health and medical expenditures throughout the Nation;
<br>
<br>(C) the rate of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, suicide, and the exacerbation of existing mental illnesses among current and former inmates, contributing to increased health and medical expenditures throughout the Nation; and
<br>
<br>(D) the risk of recidivism, civil strife, and violent crime by individuals who have been brutalized by prison rape.

<br>Executive Documents
<br>Implementing the Prison Rape Elimination Act
<br>
<br>Memorandum of President of the United States, May 17, 2012, 77 F.R. 30873, provided:
<br>
<br>Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
<br>
<br>Sexual violence, against any victim, is an assault on human dignity and an affront to American values. The Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 (PREA) was enacted with bipartisan support and established a "zero-tolerance standard" for rape in prisons in the United States. 42 U.S.C. 15602(1) [now 34 U.S.C. 30301(1)].
<br>
<br>My Administration, with leadership from the Department of Justice, has worked diligently to implement the principles set out in PREA. Today, the Attorney General finalized a rule adopting national standards to prevent, detect, and respond to prison rape. This rule expresses my Administration's conclusion that PREA applies to all Federal confinement facilities, including those operated by executive departments and agencies (agencies) other than the Department of Justice, whether administered by the Federal Government or by a private organization on behalf of the Federal Government.
<br>
<br>Each agency is responsible for, and must be accountable for, the operations of its own confinement facilities, and each agency has extensive expertise regarding its own facilities, particularly those housing unique populations. Thus, each agency is best positioned to determine how to implement the Federal laws and rules that govern its own operations, the conduct of its own employees, and the safety of persons in its custody. To advance the goals of PREA, we must ensure that all agencies that operate confinement facilities adopt high standards to prevent, detect, and respond to sexual abuse. In addition to adopting such standards, the success of PREA in combating sexual abuse in confinement facilities will depend on effective agency and facility leadership and the development of an agency culture that prioritizes efforts to combat sexual abuse.
<br>
<br>In order to implement PREA comprehensively across the Federal Government, I hereby direct all agencies with Federal confinement facilities that are not already subject to the Department of Justice's final rule to work with the Attorney General to propose, within 120 days of the date of this memorandum, any rules or procedures necessary to satisfy the requirements of PREA and to finalize any such rules or procedures within 240 days of their proposal.
<br>
<br>This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with the requirements of Executive Order 13175 of November 6, 2000 (Consultation and Coordination With Indian Tribal Governments).
<br>
<br>This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
<br>
<br>The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.
<br>
<br>Barack Obama.      
<br>§30302. Purposes
<br>
<br>The purposes of this chapter are to—
<br>
<br>(1) establish a zero-tolerance standard for the incidence of prison rape in prisons in the United States;
<br>
<br>(2) make the prevention of prison rape a top priority in each prison system;
<br>
<br>(3) develop and implement national standards for the detection, prevention, reduction, and punishment of prison rape;
<br>
<br>(4) increase the available data and information on the incidence of prison rape, consequently improving the management and administration of correctional facilities;
<br>
<br>(5) standardize the definitions used for collecting data on the incidence of prison rape;
<br>
<br>(6) increase the accountability of prison officials who fail to detect, prevent, reduce, and punish prison rape;
<br>
<br>(7) protect the Eighth Amendment rights of Federal, State, and local prisoners;
<br>
<br>(8) increase the efficiency and effectiveness of Federal expenditures through grant programs such as those dealing with health care; mental health care; disease prevention; crime prevention, investigation, and prosecution; prison construction, maintenance, and operation; race relations; poverty; unemployment; and homelessness; and
<br>
<br>(9) reduce the costs that prison rape imposes on interstate commerce.

<br>§30303. National prison rape statistics, data, and research
<br>(a) Annual comprehensive statistical review
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Bureau of Justice Statistics of the Department of Justice (in this section referred to as the "Bureau") shall carry out, for each calendar year, a comprehensive statistical review and analysis of the incidence and effects of prison rape. The statistical review and analysis shall include, but not be limited to the identification of the common characteristics of—
<br>
<br>(A) both victims and perpetrators of prison rape; and
<br>
<br>(B) prisons and prison systems with a high incidence of prison rape.
<br>(2) Considerations
<br>
<br>In carrying out paragraph (1), the Bureau shall consider—
<br>
<br>(A) how rape should be defined for the purposes of the statistical review and analysis;
<br>
<br>(B) how the Bureau should collect information about staff-on-inmate sexual assault;
<br>
<br>(C) how the Bureau should collect information beyond inmate self-reports of prison rape;
<br>
<br>(D) how the Bureau should adjust the data in order to account for differences among prisons as required by subsection (c)(3);
<br>
<br>(E) the categorization of prisons as required by subsection (c)(4); and
<br>
<br>(F) whether a preliminary study of prison rape should be conducted to inform the methodology of the comprehensive statistical review.
<br>(3) Solicitation of views
<br>
<br>The Bureau of Justice Statistics shall solicit views from representatives of the following: State departments of correction; county and municipal jails; juvenile correctional facilities; former inmates; victim advocates; researchers; and other experts in the area of sexual assault.
<br>(4) Sampling techniques
<br>
<br>The review and analysis under paragraph (1) shall be based on a random sample, or other scientifically appropriate sample, of not less than 10 percent of all Federal, State, and county prisons, and a representative sample of municipal prisons. The selection shall include at least one prison from each State. The selection of facilities for sampling shall be made at the latest practicable date prior to conducting the surveys and shall not be disclosed to any facility or prison system official prior to the time period studied in the survey. Selection of a facility for sampling during any year shall not preclude its selection for sampling in any subsequent year.
<br>(5) Surveys
<br>
<br>In carrying out the review and analysis under paragraph (1), the Bureau shall, in addition to such other methods as the Bureau considers appropriate, use surveys and other statistical studies of current and former inmates from a sample of Federal, State, county, and municipal prisons. The Bureau shall ensure the confidentiality of each survey participant, except as authorized in paragraph (7).
<br>(6) Participation in survey
<br>
<br>Federal, State, or local officials or facility administrators that receive a request from the Bureau under subsection (a)(4) or (5) will be required to participate in the national survey and provide access to any inmates under their legal custody.
<br>(7) Reporting on child abuse and neglect
<br>
<br>Nothing in section 10134 or 10231 of this title or any other provision of law, including paragraph (5), shall prevent the Bureau (including its agents), in carrying out the review and analysis under paragraph (1), from reporting to the designated public officials such information (and only such information) regarding child abuse or child neglect with respect to which the statutes or regulations of a State (or a political subdivision thereof) require prompt reporting.
<br>(b) Review Panel on Prison Rape
<br>(1) Establishment
<br>
<br>To assist the Bureau in carrying out the review and analysis under subsection (a), there is established, within the Department of Justice, the Review Panel on Prison Rape (in this section referred to as the "Panel").
<br>(2) Membership
<br>(A) Composition
<br>
<br>The Panel shall be composed of 3 members, each of whom shall be appointed by the Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
<br>(B) Qualifications
<br>
<br>Members of the Panel shall be selected from among individuals with knowledge or expertise in matters to be studied by the Panel.
<br>(3) Public hearings
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The duty of the Panel shall be to carry out, for each calendar year, public hearings concerning the operation of the three prisons with the highest incidence of prison rape and the two prisons with the lowest incidence of prison rape in each category of facilities identified under subsection (c)(4). The Panel shall hold a separate hearing regarding the three Federal or State prisons with the highest incidence of prison rape. The purpose of these hearings shall be to collect evidence to aid in the identification of common characteristics of both victims and perpetrators of prison rape, and the identification of common characteristics of prisons and prison systems with a high incidence of prison rape, and the identification of common characteristics of prisons and prison systems that appear to have been successful in deterring prison rape.
<br>(B) Testimony at hearings
<br>(i) Public officials
<br>
<br>In carrying out the hearings required under subparagraph (A), the Panel shall request the public testimony of Federal, State, and local officials (and organizations that represent such officials), including the warden or director of each prison, who bears responsibility for the prevention, detection, and punishment of prison rape at each entity, and the head of the prison system encompassing such prison.
<br>(ii) Victims
<br>
<br>The Panel may request the testimony of prison rape victims, organizations representing such victims, and other appropriate individuals and organizations.
<br>(C) Subpoenas
<br>(i) Issuance
<br>
<br>The Panel may issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and the production of written or other matter.
<br>(ii) Enforcement
<br>
<br>In the case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena, the Attorney General may in a Federal court of appropriate jurisdiction obtain an appropriate order to enforce the subpoena.
<br>(c) Reports

<br>(iii) an identification of those institutions in the representative sample that appear to have been successful in deterring prison rape; and
<br>
<br>(C) a listing of any prisons in the representative sample that did not cooperate with the survey conducted pursuant to this section.
<br>(3) Data adjustments
<br>
<br>In preparing the information specified in paragraph (2), the Attorney General shall use established statistical methods to adjust the data as necessary to account for differences among institutions in the representative sample, which are not related to the detection, prevention, reduction and punishment of prison rape, or which are outside the control of the State, prison, or prison system, in order to provide an accurate comparison among prisons. Such differences may include the mission, security level, size, and jurisdiction under which the prison operates. For each such adjustment made, the Attorney General shall identify and explain such adjustment in the report.
<br>(4) Categorization of prisons
<br>
<br>The report shall divide the prisons surveyed into three categories. One category shall be composed of all Federal and State prisons. The other two categories shall be defined by the Attorney General in order to compare similar institutions.

<br>§30501. Findings
<br>
<br>Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>(1) The incidence of violence motivated by the actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability of the victim poses a serious national problem.
<br>
<br>(2) Such violence disrupts the tranquility and safety of communities and is deeply divisive.
<br>
<br>(3) State and local authorities are now and will continue to be responsible for prosecuting the overwhelming majority of violent crimes in the United States, including violent crimes motivated by bias. These authorities can carry out their responsibilities more effectively with greater Federal assistance.
<br>
<br>(4) Existing Federal law is inadequate to address this problem.
<br>
<br>(5) A prominent characteristic of a violent crime motivated by bias is that it devastates not just the actual victim and the family and friends of the victim, but frequently savages the community sharing the traits that caused the victim to be selected.
<br>
<br>(6) Such violence substantially affects interstate commerce in many ways, including the following:
<br>
<br>(A) The movement of members of targeted groups is impeded, and members of such groups are forced to move across State lines to escape the incidence or risk of such violence.
<br>
<br>(B) Members of targeted groups are prevented from purchasing goods and services, obtaining or sustaining employment, or participating in other commercial activity.
<br>
<br>(C) Perpetrators cross State lines to commit such violence.
<br>
<br>(D) Channels, facilities, and instrumentalities of interstate commerce are used to facilitate the commission of such violence.
<br>
<br>(E) Such violence is committed using articles that have traveled in interstate commerce.
<br>
<br>(7) For generations, the institutions of slavery and involuntary servitude were defined by the race, color, and ancestry of those held in bondage. Slavery and involuntary servitude were enforced, both prior to and after the adoption of the 13th amendment to the Constitution of the United States, through widespread public and private violence directed at persons because of their race, color, or ancestry, or perceived race, color, or ancestry. Accordingly, eliminating racially motivated violence is an important means of eliminating, to the extent possible, the badges, incidents, and relics of slavery and involuntary servitude.
<br>
<br>(8) Both at the time when the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments to the Constitution of the United States were adopted, and continuing to date, members of certain religious and national origin groups were and are perceived to be distinct "races". Thus, in order to eliminate, to the extent possible, the badges, incidents, and relics of slavery, it is necessary to prohibit assaults on the basis of real or perceived religions or national origins, at least to the extent such religions or national origins were regarded as races at the time of the adoption of the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments to the Constitution of the United States.
<br>
<br>(9) Federal jurisdiction over certain violent crimes motivated by bias enables Federal, State, and local authorities to work together as partners in the investigation and prosecution of such crimes.
<br>
<br>(10) The problem of crimes motivated by bias is sufficiently serious, widespread, and interstate in nature as to warrant Federal assistance to States, local jurisdictions, and Indian tribes.
