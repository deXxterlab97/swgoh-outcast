<br>§4101. Congressional findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) the Federal Government has a responsibility to promote the general welfare of the Nation—
<br>
<br>(A) by using Federal resources to aid families and individuals seeking affordable homes in safe and healthy environments and, in particular, assisting responsible, deserving citizens who cannot provide fully for themselves because of temporary circumstances or factors beyond their control;
<br>
<br>(B) by working to ensure a thriving national economy and a strong private housing market; and
<br>
<br>(C) by developing effective partnerships among the Federal Government, State, tribal, and local governments, and private entities that allow government to accept responsibility for fostering the development of a healthy marketplace and allow families to prosper without government involvement in their day-to-day activities;
<br>
<br>(2) there exists a unique relationship between the Government of the United States and the governments of Indian tribes and a unique Federal responsibility to Indian people;
<br>
<br>(3) the Constitution of the United States invests the Congress with plenary power over the field of Indian affairs, and through treaties, statutes, and historical relations with Indian tribes, the United States has undertaken a unique trust responsibility to protect and support Indian tribes and Indian people;
<br>
<br>(4) the Congress, through treaties, statutes, and the general course of dealing with Indian tribes, has assumed a trust responsibility for the protection and preservation of Indian tribes and for working with tribes and their members to improve their housing conditions and socioeconomic status so that they are able to take greater responsibility for their own economic condition;
<br>
<br>(5) providing affordable homes in safe and healthy environments is an essential element in the special role of the United States in helping tribes and their members to improve their housing conditions and socioeconomic status;
<br>
<br>(6) the need for affordable homes in safe and healthy environments on Indian reservations, in Indian communities, and in Native Alaskan villages is acute and the Federal Government shall work not only to provide housing assistance, but also, to the extent practicable, to assist in the development of private housing finance mechanisms on Indian lands to achieve the goals of economic self-sufficiency and self-determination for tribes and their members; and
<br>
<br>(7) Federal assistance to meet these responsibilities shall be provided in a manner that recognizes the right of Indian self-determination and tribal self-governance by making such assistance available directly to the Indian tribes or tribally designated entities under authorities similar to those accorded Indian tribes in Public Law 93–638 (25 U.S.C. 450 et seq.).1

<br>SUBCHAPTER I—BLOCK GRANTS AND GRANT REQUIREMENTS
<br>§4111. Block grants
<br>(a) Authority
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>For each fiscal year, the Secretary shall (to the extent amounts are made available to carry out this chapter) make grants under this section on behalf of Indian tribes—
<br>
<br>(A) to carry out affordable housing activities under part A of subchapter II; and
<br>
<br>(B) to carry out self-determined housing activities for tribal communities programs under part B of that subchapter.
<br>(2) Provision of amounts
<br>
<br>Under such a grant on behalf of an Indian tribe, the Secretary shall provide the grant amounts for the tribe directly to the recipient for the tribe.
<br>(b) Plan requirement
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary may make a grant under this chapter on behalf of an Indian tribe for a fiscal year only if—
<br>
<br>(A) the Indian tribe has submitted to the Secretary an Indian housing plan for such fiscal year under section 4112 of this title; and
<br>
<br>(B) the plan has been determined under section 4113 of this title to comply with the requirements of section 4112 of this title.
<br>(2) Waiver
<br>
<br>The Secretary may waive the applicability of the requirements under paragraph (1), in whole or in part, for a period of not more than 90 days, if the Secretary determines that an Indian tribe has not complied with, or is unable to comply with, those requirements due to exigent circumstances beyond the control of the Indian tribe.
<br>(c) Local cooperation agreement
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, grant amounts provided under this chapter on behalf of an Indian tribe may not be used for rental or lease-purchase homeownership units that are owned by the recipient for the tribe unless the governing body of the locality within which the property subject to the development activities to be assisted with the grant amounts is or will be situated has entered into an agreement with the recipient for the tribe providing for local cooperation required by the Secretary pursuant to this chapter. The Secretary may waive the requirements of this subsection and subsection (d) if the recipient has made a good faith effort to fulfill the requirements of this subsection and subsection (d) and agrees to make payments in lieu of taxes to the appropriate taxing authority in an amount consistent with the requirements of subsection (d)(2) until such time as the matter of making such payments has been resolved in accordance with subsection (d).
<br>(d) Exemption from taxation
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, grant amounts provided under this chapter on behalf of an Indian tribe may not be used for affordable housing activities under this chapter for rental or lease-purchase dwelling units developed under the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.) or with amounts provided under this chapter that are owned by the recipient for the tribe unless—
<br>
<br>(1) such dwelling units (which, in the case of units in a multi-unit project, shall be exclusive of any portions of the project not developed under the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.] or with amounts provided under this chapter) are exempt from all real and personal property taxes levied or imposed by any State, tribe, city, county, or other political subdivision; and
<br>
<br>(2) the recipient for the tribe makes annual payments of user fees to compensate such governments for the costs of providing governmental services, including police and fire protection, roads, water and sewerage systems, utilities systems and related facilities, or payments in lieu of taxes to such taxing authority, in an amount equal to the greater of $150 per dwelling unit or 10 percent of the difference between the shelter rent and the utility cost, or such lesser amount as—
<br>
<br>(A) is prescribed by State, tribal, or local law;
<br>
<br>(B) is agreed to by the local governing body in the agreement under subsection (c); or
<br>
<br>(C) the recipient and the local governing body agree that such user fees or payments in lieu of taxes shall not be made.
<br>(e) Effect of failure to exempt from taxation
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding subsection (d), a grant recipient that does not comply with the requirements under such subsection may receive a block grant under this chapter, but only if the tribe, State, city, county, or other political subdivision in which the affordable housing development is located contributes, in the form of cash or tax remission, the amount by which the taxes paid with respect to the development exceed the amounts prescribed in subsection (d)(2).
<br>(f) Amount
<br>
<br>Except as otherwise provided under this chapter, the amount of a grant under this section to a recipient for a fiscal year shall be—
<br>

<br>
<br>(2) in the case of a recipient whose grant beneficiary is more than 1 Indian tribe, the sum of the amounts of the allocations under section 4151 of this title for each such Indian tribe.
<br>(g) Use for affordable housing activities under plan
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subsection (h) of this section and part B of subchapter II, amounts provided under a grant under this section may be used only for affordable housing activities under subchapter II that are consistent with an Indian housing plan approved under section 4113 of this title.
<br>(h) Administrative and planning expenses
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall, by regulation, authorize each recipient to use a percentage of any grant amounts received under this chapter for comprehensive housing and community development planning activities and for any reasonable administrative and planning expenses of the recipient relating to carrying out this chapter and activities assisted with such amounts, which may include costs for salaries of individuals engaged in administering and managing affordable housing activities assisted with grant amounts provided under this chapter and expenses of preparing an Indian housing plan under section 4112 of this title.
<br>(i) Public-private partnerships
<br>
<br>Each recipient shall make all reasonable efforts, consistent with the purposes of this chapter, to maximize participation by the private sector, including nonprofit organizations and for-profit entities, in implementing the approved Indian housing plan.
<br>(j) Federal supply sources
<br>
<br>For purposes of section 501 of title 40, on election by the applicable Indian tribe—
<br>
<br>(1) each Indian tribe or tribally designated housing entity shall be considered to be an Executive agency in carrying out any program, service, or other activity under this chapter; and
<br>
<br>(2) each Indian tribe or tribally designated housing entity and each employee of the Indian tribe or tribally designated housing entity shall have access to sources of supply on the same basis as employees of an Executive agency.
<br>(k) Tribal preference in employment and contracting
