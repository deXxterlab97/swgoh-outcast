<br>(a) Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) the illicit narcotics epidemic currently afflicting the United States represents a direct threat to the well-being of every United States citizen;
<br>
<br>(2) every effective means must be pursued to reduce the foreign production and subsequent importation into the United States of illicit narcotics;
<br>
<br>(3) the multilateral development banks can play an integral role in efforts to control the production of illicit narcotics;
<br>
<br>(4) producer country narcotics eradication programs will not be effective unless such programs provide an economic alternative to the production of narcotics;
<br>
<br>(5) efforts to address the illicit narcotics epidemic through production control are doomed to failure unless greater effort is applied to curb use of and demand for illicit narcotics; and
<br>
<br>(6) the appropriate role for the multilateral development banks in the "War Against Drugs" is through coordinating and financing alternative economic opportunities in producer and trafficking countries.

<br>The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the United States Executive Director of the Inter-American Development Bank to initiate discussions with other executive directors of such institutions and to advocate and support the creation, within such institutions, of specific country lending programs and policies (including crop substitution, creation of roads conducive to the expansion of markets for licit goods, other infrastructure development measures such as development projects generating employment, agricultural extension assistance, and region-specific development plans) which are particularly oriented to reducing or eliminating the economic dependence of regions of borrowing countries known to be areas in which illicit narcotics are produced or trafficked, on such production and trafficking.
<br>(c) Coordination among assistance programs designed to reduce economic dependency on illicit narcotics
<br>
<br>In addition, the Secretary of the Treasury should instruct the United States Executive Director of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the United States Executive Director of the Inter-American Development Bank to encourage such institutions to provide coordination among other multilateral and bilateral assistance programs designed to reduce the economic dependence of regions of borrowing countries known to be areas in which illicit narcotics are produced or trafficked, on such production and trafficking.

<br>(a) Finding
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that a principal focus of United States Government policy in the multilateral development banks has been and should be to foster greater development of the private sector in member borrowing countries of such banks.
<br>(b) Technical assistance to transform government-owned enterprises into privately owned enterprises
<br>
<br>In order to assist and strengthen the advancement of ongoing efforts to have the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development play a key role in building a viable private sector in member borrowing countries of such bank, and to further assist such bank in its determination to facilitate the transfer of government-owned enterprises in such countries to private ownership, the Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director of such bank to vigorously encourage the provision of technical assistance to such countries (relying, where appropriate, on the expertise of the International Finance Corporation or the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency) to transform enterprises owned, in whole or part, by the governments of such countries into privately owned, self-sufficient enterprises. Such technical assistance may involve the valuation of the assets of such government-owned enterprises, the assessment of tender offers, and the creation or strengthening of market-based mechanisms to facilitate such a transfer of ownership.
<br>(c) Reports
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The United States Executive Director of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development shall submit 3 reports to the Congress on—

<br>§262p–4c. Initiation of discussions to facilitate debt-for-development swaps for human welfare and environmental conservation
<br>(a) Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) voluntary debt-for-development swaps in heavily indebted developing nations can simultaneously facilitate reduction of the burden of external indebtedness and increase the resources available within the country for charitable, educational, and scientific purposes, including environmental conservation, education, human welfare, health, agricultural research and development, microenterprise credit, and development of indigenous nonprofit organizations; and
<br>
<br>(2) heavily indebted developing countries may desire to facilitate such swaps to the maximum extent consistent with sound domestic economic management and minimization of inflationary impact.
<br>(b) Initiation of discussions to facilitate debt-for-development swaps for human welfare and environmental conservation
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to initiate discussions with the directors of such bank, the International Development Association, and the International Finance Corporation and propose that such institutions provide advice and assistance, as appropriate, to borrowing country governments desiring to facilitate debt-for-development swaps, on mechanisms (including trust funds) to accomplish this purpose, particularly in the context of debt rescheduling, which mechanisms result in sound management of the macroeconomic impact of such swaps on such countries, and preserve the value of the capital obtained through such swaps.

<br>(a) Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) the heavy burden of debt borne by sub-Saharan governments undermines efforts by such governments to finance projects and programs designed to promote charitable, educational, and scientific purposes, including education, human welfare, health, agricultural research and development, and conservation, restoration and enhancement of the natural resource base; and
<br>
<br>(2) the financing of programs to promote such charitable, educational, and scientific purposes should be facilitated in the context of reducing and converting sovereign debt of sub-Saharan governments, as encouraged in the final communique of the June 1988 economic summit conference in Toronto, Canada, through such means as—
<br>
<br>(A) concessional interest rates;
<br>
<br>(B) extended repayment periods; or
<br>
<br>(C) partial or complete write-offs of debt service obligations.
<br>(b) Initiation of discussions to facilitate financing of human welfare and natural resource programs in sub-Saharan Africa in connection with debt reduction and conversion
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director of the African Development Bank and the African Development Fund to initiate discussions with the directors of such institutions and propose that such institutions, jointly with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Development Association, and the International Finance Corporation, as appropriate, provide advice and assistance to government creditors holding sovereign debt of any sub-Saharan government, and to sub-Saharan governments which desire to finance programs with local currencies obtained through debt reduction and conversion to promote charitable, educational, and scientific (including conservation and restoration of natural resources) purposes, as a condition of reducing or converting such sovereign debt.

<br>§262p–4f. Assistance to countries to develop statistical assessment of well-being of poor
<br>(a) Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) improvement in the capacity of developing countries to measure and monitor regularly the nutritional and physical well-being of the poorest 40 percent of the population of each of such countries is essential to the development of policies to reduce absolute poverty;
<br>
<br>(2) internationally accepted statistical indicators that measure reliably the extent of absolute poverty and identify the location and characteristics of the poor are being developed and refined to guide policy formulation and target assistance to the poor;
<br>
<br>(3) such guidance by indicators is, however, not able to be used in some developing countries, especially the poorest countries, due to the woeful unavailability of statistical data;
<br>
<br>(4) the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Development Association have the technical and financial capability to assist borrowing country governments to develop such statistical measurement capabilities for social indicators necessary for the design and monitoring of poverty-reduction policies for such governments;
<br>
<br>(5) availability of social indicator data is also essential to the work of such institutions, particularly in monitoring the impact of structural adjustment lending on the poor; and
<br>
<br>(6) availability of such indicators will also facilitate the measurement of progress in the alleviation of poverty by other donor agencies, public and private.
<br>(b) Assistance to countries to develop statistical assessment of well-being of poor
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Development Association to advocate and support, as an immediate priority, assistance by such institutions to borrowing country governments to develop appropriate statistical measures for assessing the physical well-being of the poor, by sex and age, by using such indicators as mortality, health, education, and nutrition, as well as wealth and income, and maintain and publish such indicators on an ongoing basis.

<br>§262p–4h. Discussions to increase productive economic participation of poor; reports
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director for each multilateral development bank to vigorously and continually advocate, in all replenishment negotiations and in discussion with other directors of such bank and with such bank, the following:
<br>
<br>(1) A major objective of such bank's operations and financing in each borrowing country, as a long term priority, should be to increase the productive role of the poor in the economy of such country.
<br>
<br>(2) Such bank should encourage and assist each borrowing country to develop sustainable national plans and strategies to eliminate the causes and alleviate the manifestations of poverty which keep the poor from leading economically and socially productive lives. Such plans and strategies should give attention to—
<br>
<br>(A) the enhancement of human resources, including programs for basic nutrition, primary health services, basic education, and safe water and basic sanitation;
<br>
<br>(B) access to income-generating activities, employment, and productive assets such as land and credit; and
<br>
<br>(C) consultation with public sector social agencies and local non-governmental organizations.
<br>
<br>(3) As an integral element of ongoing policy dialogue with each borrowing country to design structural adjustment plans and project lending programs, such bank should provide assistance consistent with achieving the objectives of the country's national plan for increasing the productive economic participation of the poor. Such dialogue should be conducted with government agencies working in social and economic sectors and with non-governmental groups in the borrowing country, especially those that have grassroots involvement with poor people.
<br>
<br>(4) In an annual review document, such bank should describe the extent to which the goal of increasing the productive economic participation of the poor is being advanced or retarded and the steps that are being taken to overcome obstacles to its fulfillment. Such review should be based on information contained in the bank's country implementation review documents and in the country strategy documents for each borrowing country. Such country strategy documents should describe the national strategy for productive economic participation of the poor and the steps the bank plans to take to assist the borrowing country during the period covered by the country strategy document.
<br>
<br>(5) Such bank should assist countries in assessing and monitoring progress in achieving poverty alleviation goals and targets through measurement by appropriate social indicators.
<br>
<br>(6) Such bank should adopt procedures and budgetary allocations for administrative purposes, and establish appropriate staffing levels, to ensure that adequate resources are available to implement the bank's program for enhancing the productive economic participation of the poor, in consultation with non-governmental groups.
<br>
<br>(7) Such bank should adopt, as a separate and major criterion in the allocation of concessional financing resources, a preferential allocation to each country which undertakes significant efforts to enhance the productive economic participation of the poor.
<br>
<br>(8) Such bank should require each country which receives structural adjustment assistance to have in place, after a reasonable phase-in period, a strategy to enhance the productive economic participation of the poor.
<br>(b) Progress report
<br>
<br>Before the end of the 1-year period beginning on December 19, 1989, the Secretary of the Treasury shall submit to the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives, and the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate, a report on the following:
<br>
<br>(1) The status of advocacy and progress being made to implement the objectives of subsection (a), describing the success to date, the obstacles encountered, and future expectations of progress.
<br>
<br>(2) A description of the progress to date in achieving the purposes of section 262p–4f of this title, including the institutional capacity and effort devoted to assisting in the development of statistical measures to assess the well-being of the poor.
<br>
<br>(3) A description and evaluation of the progress to date in developing effective mechanisms for involving non-governmental organizations, directly or indirectly, in the design, implementation, and monitoring of development projects, programs, and policies of the multilateral development banks.

<br>
<br>(3) encourage the banks to assist such countries in reducing and restructuring private debt through the use of a portion of a project or policy based environmental loan in ways which will enable such countries to buy back private debt at a rate of discount available for such debt, at auction in the secondary market or through negotiations with creditors holding such debt;
<br>
<br>(4) seek to ensure that staff of each bank facilitate debtor countries' collaboration with local and international non-governmental or private organizations in implementing debt-for-nature exchanges; and
<br>
<br>(5) seek to ensure that each bank adopts policy guidelines which to the maximum extent possible provide for—
<br>
<br>(A) the inclusion of sustainable use policies in loan agreements negotiated with borrower members;
<br>
<br>(B) the adoption of economic programs to foster sound environmental policies; and

<br>
<br>(ix) promotion of regenerative approaches in farming, forestry, and watershed management.
<br>(b) Negotiation of guidelines for restoration, protection, or sustainable use policies
<br>
<br>The United States Executive Directors of the multilateral development banks shall seek to negotiate with the other executive directors to provide guidelines for restoration, protection, or sustainable use policies. Pending the outcome of such negotiations, the United States Executive Directors shall consider restoration, protection, or sustainable use policies to be those which—
<br>
<br>(1) support development that maintains and restores the renewable natural resource base so that present and future needs of debtor countries' populations can be met, while not impairing critical ecosystems and not exacerbating global environmental problems;
<br>
<br>(2) are environmentally sustainable in that resources are conserved and managed in an effort to remove pressure on the natural resource base and to make judicious use of the land so as to sustain growth and the availability of all natural resources;
<br>
<br>(3) support development that does not exceed the limits imposed by local hydrological cycles, soil, climate, vegetation, and human cultural practices;
<br>
<br>(4) promote the maintenance and restoration of soils, vegetation, hydrological cycles, wildlife, critical ecosystems (tropical forests, wetlands, and coastal marine resources), biological diversity and other natural resources essential to economic growth and human well-being and shall, when using natural resources, be implemented to minimize the depletion of such natural resources; and
<br>
<br>(5) take steps, wherever feasible, to prevent pollution that threatens human health and important biotic systems and to achieve patterns of energy consumption that meet human needs and rely on renewable resources.

<br>§262p–6. Improvement of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative
<br>(a) Improvement of the HIPC Initiative
<br>
<br>In order to accelerate multilateral debt relief and promote human and economic development and poverty alleviation in heavily indebted poor countries, the Congress urges the President to commence immediately efforts, with the Paris Club of Official Creditors, as well as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank), and other appropriate multilateral development institutions to accomplish the following modifications to the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative:
<br>(1) Focus on poverty reduction, good governance, transparency, and participation of citizens
<br>
<br>A country which is otherwise eligible to receive cancellation of debt under the modified Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative may receive such cancellation only if the country has committed, in connection with social and economic reform programs that are jointly developed, financed, and administered by the World Bank and the IMF—
<br>
<br>(A) to enable, facilitate, or encourage the implementation of policy changes and institutional reforms under economic reform programs, in a manner that ensures that such policy changes and institutional reforms are designed and adopted through transparent and participatory processes;
<br>
<br>(B) to adopt an integrated development strategy to support poverty reduction through economic growth, that includes monitorable poverty reduction goals;
<br>
<br>(C) to take steps so that the financial benefits of debt relief are applied to programs to combat poverty (in particular through concrete measures to improve economic infrastructure, basic services in education, nutrition, and health, particularly treatment and prevention of the leading causes of mortality) and to redress environmental degradation;
<br>
<br>(D) to take steps to strengthen and expand the private sector, encourage increased trade and investment, support the development of free markets, and promote broad-scale economic growth;
<br>
<br>(E) to implement transparent policy making and budget procedures, good governance, and effective anticorruption measures;
<br>
<br>(F) to broaden public participation and popular understanding of the principles and goals of poverty reduction, particularly through economic growth, and good governance; and
<br>
<br>(G) to promote the participation of citizens and nongovernmental organizations in the economic policy choices of the government.
<br>(2) Faster debt relief
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Treasury should urge the IMF and the World Bank to complete a debt sustainability analysis by December 31, 2000, and determine eligibility for debt relief, for as many of the countries under the modified Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative as possible.
<br>(b) Heavily Indebted Poor Countries review
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Treasury, after consulting with the Committees on Banking and Financial Services and International Relations of the House of Representatives, and the Committees on Foreign Relations and Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate, shall make every effort (including instructing the United States Directors at the IMF and World Bank) to ensure that an external assessment of the modified Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, including the reformed Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility program as it relates to that Initiative, takes place by December 31, 2001, incorporating the views of debtor governments and civil society, and that such assessment be made public.

<br>
<br>(1) The development of country-specific poverty reduction strategies (Poverty Reduction Strategies) under the leadership of such countries that—

<br>(A) will be set out in poverty reduction strategy papers (PRSPs) that provide the basis for the lending operations of the International Development Association (IDA) and the reformed Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF);
<br>
<br>(B) will reflect the World Bank's role in poverty reduction and the IMF's role in macroeconomic issues;
<br>

<br>
<br>(D) should include—
<br>
<br>(i) implementation of transparent budgetary procedures and mechanisms to help ensure that the financial benefits of debt relief under the modified Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (as defined in section 262p–6 of this title) are applied to programs that combat poverty; and

<br>(ii) monitorable indicators of progress in poverty reduction.
<br>
<br>(2) The adoption of procedures for periodic comprehensive reviews of reformed ESAF and IDA programs to help ensure progress toward longer-term poverty goals outlined in the Poverty Reduction Strategies and to allow adjustments in such programs.

<br>(3) The publication of the PRSPs prior to Executive Board review of related programs under IDA and the reformed ESAF.
<br>
<br>(4) The establishment of a standing evaluation unit at the IMF, similar to the Operations Evaluation Department of the World Bank, that would report directly to the Executive Board of the IMF and that would undertake periodic reviews of IMF operations, including the operations of the reformed ESAF, including—
<br>
<br>(A) assessments of experience under the reformed ESAF programs in the areas of poverty reduction, economic growth, and access to basic social services;
<br>
<br>(B) assessments of the extent and quality of participation in program design by citizens;

<br>
<br>(6) The adoption by the IMF of policies aimed at reforming ESAF so that reformed ESAF programs are consistent with the Poverty Reduction Strategies.
