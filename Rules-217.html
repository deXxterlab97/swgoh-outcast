<br>(3) The amount of additional optional insurance continued under paragraph (2) shall be continued, with or without reduction, in accordance with the employee's written election at the time eligibility to continue insurance during retirement or receipt of compensation arises, as follows:
<br>
<br>(A) The employee may elect to have withholdings cease in accordance with subsection (d), in which case—
<br>
<br>(i) the amount of additional optional insurance continued under paragraph (2) shall be reduced each month by 2 percent effective at the beginning of the second calendar month after the date the employee becomes 65 years of age and is retired or is in receipt of compensation; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the reduction under clause (i) shall continue for 50 months at which time the insurance shall stop.
<br>
<br>(B) The employee may, instead of the option under subparagraph (A), elect to have the full cost of additional optional insurance continue to be withheld from such employee's annuity or compensation on and after the date such withholdings would otherwise cease pursuant to an election under subparagraph (A), in which case the amount of additional optional insurance continued under paragraph (2) shall not be reduced, subject to paragraph (4).
<br>
<br>(C) An employee who does not make any election under the preceding provisions of this paragraph shall be treated as if such employee had made an election under subparagraph (A).
<br>
<br>(4) If an employee makes an election under paragraph (3)(B), that individual may subsequently cancel such election, in which case additional optional insurance shall be determined as if the individual had originally made an election under paragraph (3)(A).
<br>
<br>(5)(A) An employee whose additional optional insurance under this section would otherwise stop in accordance with paragraph (1) and who is not eligible to continue insurance under paragraph (2) may elect, under conditions prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management, to continue all or a portion of so much of the additional optional insurance as has been in force for not less than—
<br>
<br>(i) the 5 years of service immediately preceding the date of the event which would cause insurance to stop under paragraph (1); or
<br>
<br>(ii) the full period or periods of service during which the insurance was available to the employee, if fewer than 5 years,
<br>
<br>at group rates established for purposes of this section, in lieu of conversion to an individual policy. The amount of insurance continued under this paragraph shall be reduced by 50 percent effective at the beginning of the second calendar month after the date the employee or former employee attains age 70 and shall stop at the beginning of the second calendar month after attainment of age 80, subject to a provision for temporary extension of life insurance coverage and for conversion to an individual policy of life insurance under conditions approved by the Office. Alternatively, insurance continued under this paragraph may be reduced or stopped at any time the employee or former employee elects.
<br>
<br>(B) When an employee or former employee elects to continue additional optional insurance under this paragraph following separation from service or 12 months without pay, the insured individual shall submit timely payment of the full cost thereof, plus any amount the Office determines necessary to cover associated administrative expenses, in such manner as the Office shall prescribe by regulation. Amounts required under this subparagraph shall be deposited, used, and invested as provided under section 8714 and shall be reported and accounted for together with amounts withheld under section 8714a(d).
<br>
<br>(C)(i) Subject to clause (ii), no election to continue additional optional insurance may be made under this paragraph 3 years after the effective date of this paragraph.
<br>
<br>(ii) On and after the date on which an election may not be made under clause (i), all additional optional insurance under this paragraph for former employees shall terminate, subject to a provision for temporary extension of life insurance coverage and for conversion to an individual policy of life insurance under conditions approved by the Office.
<br>
<br>(d)(1) During each period in which the additional optional insurance is in force on an employee the full cost thereof shall be withheld from the employee's pay. During each period in which an employee continues additional optional insurance after retirement or while in receipt of compensation under subchapter I of chapter 81 of this title because of disease or injury to the employee, as provided in subsection (c) of this section, the full cost thereof shall be withheld from the former employee's annuity or compensation, except that, if insurance is continued as provided under subsection (c)(3)(A), beginning at the end of the calendar month in which the former employee becomes 65 years of age, the additional optional life insurance shall be without cost to the former employee. Amounts so withheld (and any amounts withheld as provided in subsection (c)(3)(B)) shall be deposited, used, and invested as provided in section 8714 of this title and shall be reported and accounted for together with amounts withheld under section 8714a(d) of this title.
<br>
<br>(2) If an agency fails to withhold the proper cost of additional optional insurance from an individual's salary, compensation, or retirement annuity, the collection of amounts properly due may be waived by the agency if, in the judgment of the agency, the individual is without fault and recovery would be against equity and good conscience. However, if the agency so waives the collection of any unpaid amount, the agency shall submit an amount equal to the uncollected amount to the Office for deposit to the Employees' Life Insurance Fund.
<br>
<br>(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), an employee who is subject to withholdings under this subsection and whose pay, annuity, or compensation is insufficient to cover such withholdings may nevertheless continue additional optional insurance if the employee arranges to pay currently into the Employees' Life Insurance Fund, through the agency or retirement system which administers pay, annuity, or compensation, an amount equal to the withholdings that would otherwise be required under this subsection.
<br>
<br>(e) The cost of the additional optional insurance shall be determined from time to time by the Office on the basis of the employee's age relative to such age groups as the Office establishes under section 8714a(e) of this title.
<br>
<br>(f) The amount of additional optional life insurance in force on an employee at the date of his death shall be paid as provided in section 8705 of this title.

<br>§8714c. Optional life insurance on family members
<br>
<br>(a) Under the conditions, directives, and terms specified in sections 8709 through 8712 of this title, the Office of Personnel Management, without regard to section 6101(b) to (d) of title 41, may purchase a policy which shall make available to each employee insured under section 8702 of this title amounts of optional life insurance (without accidental death and dismemberment insurance) on the employee's family members.
<br>
<br>(b)(1) The optional life insurance on family members provided under this section shall be made available to each eligible employee who has elected coverage under this section, under conditions the Office shall prescribe, in multiples, at the employee's election, of 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 times—
<br>
<br>(A) $5,000 for a spouse; and
<br>
<br>(B) $2,500 for each child described under section 8701(d).
<br>
<br>(2) An employee may reduce or stop coverage elected pursuant to this section at any time.
<br>
<br>(c)(1) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the optional life insurance on family members shall stop at the earlier of the employee's death, the employee's separation from the service, or 12 months after discontinuance of pay, subject to a provision for temporary extension of life insurance coverage and for conversion to individual policies of life insurance under conditions approved by the Office.
<br>
<br>(2) In the case of any employee who retires on an immediate annuity or who becomes entitled to receive compensation under subchapter I of chapter 81 of this title because of disease or injury to the employee and who has had in force insurance under this section for no less than—
<br>
<br>(A) the 5 years of service immediately preceding the date of retirement or entitlement to compensation, or
<br>
<br>(B) the full period or periods of service during which the insurance was available to the employee, if fewer than 5 years,
<br>
<br>optional life insurance on family members may be continued under the same conditions as provided in section 8714b(c)(2) through (4).
<br>
<br>(d)(1) During each period in which the optional life insurance on family members is in force the full cost thereof shall be withheld from the employee's pay. During each period in which an employee continues optional life insurance on family members after retirement or while in receipt of compensation under subchapter I of chapter 81 of this title because of disease or injury to the employee, as provided in subsection (c) of this section, the full cost shall be withheld from the annuity or compensation, except that, beginning at the end of the calendar month in which the former employee becomes 65 years of age, the optional life insurance on family members shall be without cost to the employee. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the full cost shall be continued after the calendar month in which the former employee becomes 65 years of age if, and for so long as, an election under this section corresponding to that described in section 8714b(c)(3)(B) remains in effect with respect to such former employee. Amounts so withheld shall be deposited, used, and invested as provided in section 8714 of this title and shall be reported and accounted for together with amounts withheld under section 8714a(d) of this title.
<br>
<br>(2) If an agency fails to withhold the proper cost of optional life insurance on family members from an individual's salary, compensation, or retirement annuity, the collection of amounts properly due may be waived by the agency if, in the judgment of the agency, the individual is without fault and recovery would be against equity and good conscience. However, if the agency so waives the collection of any unpaid amount, the agency shall submit an amount equal to the uncollected amount to the Office for deposit to the Employees' Life Insurance Fund.
<br>
<br>(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), an employee who is subject to withholdings under this subsection and whose pay, annuity, or compensation is insufficient to cover such withholdings may nevertheless continue optional life insurance on family members if the employee arranges to pay currently into the Employees' Life Insurance Fund, through the agency or retirement system that administers pay, annuity, or compensation, an amount equal to the withholdings that would otherwise be required under this subsection.
<br>
<br>(e) The cost of the optional life insurance on family members shall be determined from time to time by the Office on the basis of the employee's age relative to such age groups as the Office establishes under section 8714a(e) of this title.
<br>
<br>(f) The amount of optional life insurance which is in force under this section on a family member of an employee or former employee on the date of the death of the family member shall be paid, on the establishment of a valid claim by the employee, to such employee or, in the event of the death of the employee before payment can be made, to the person or persons entitled to the group life insurance in force on the employee under section 8705 of this title.

<br>§8714d. Option to receive "living benefits"
<br>
<br>(a) For the purpose of this section, an individual shall be considered to be "terminally ill" if such individual has a medical prognosis that such individual's life expectancy is 9 months or less.
<br>
<br>(b) The Office of Personnel Management shall prescribe regulations under which any individual covered by group life insurance under section 8704(a) may, if such individual is terminally ill, elect to receive a lump-sum payment equal to—
<br>
<br>(1) the full amount of insurance under section 8704(a) (or portion thereof designated for this purpose under subsection (d)(4)) which would otherwise be payable under this chapter (on the establishment of a valid claim)—
<br>
<br>(A) computed based on a date determined under regulations of the Office (but not later than 30 days after the date on which the individual's application for benefits under this section is approved or deemed approved under subsection (d)(3)); and
<br>
<br>(B) assuming continued coverage under this chapter at that time;
<br>
<br>reduced by
<br>
<br>(2) an amount necessary to assure that there is no increase in the actuarial value of the benefit paid (as determined under regulations of the Office).
<br>
<br>(c)(1) If a lump-sum payment is taken under this section—
<br>
<br>(A) no insurance under the provisions of section 8704(a) or (b) shall be payable based on the death or any loss of the individual involved, unless the lump-sum payment represents only a portion of the total benefits which could have been taken, in which case benefits under those provisions shall remain in effect, except that the basic insurance amount on which they are based—
<br>
<br>(i) shall be reduced by the percentage which the designated portion comprised relative to the total benefits which could have been taken (rounding the result to the nearest multiple of $1,000 or, if midway between multiples of $1,000, to the next higher multiple of $1,000); and
<br>
<br>(ii) shall not be subject to further adjustment; and
<br>
<br>(B) deductions and withholdings under section 8707, and contributions under section 8708, shall be terminated with respect to such individual (or reduced in a manner consistent with the percentage reduction in the individual's basic insurance amount, if applicable), effective with respect to any amounts which would otherwise become due on or after the date of payment under this section.
<br>
<br>(2) An individual who takes a lump-sum payment under this section (whether full or partial) remains eligible for optional benefits under sections 8714a–8714c (subject to payment of the full cost of those benefits in accordance with applicable provisions of the section or sections involved, to the same extent as if no election under this section had been made).
<br>
<br>(d)(1) The Office's regulations shall include provisions regarding the form and manner in which an application under this section shall be made and the procedures in accordance with which any such application shall be considered.
<br>
<br>(2) An application shall not be considered to be complete unless it includes such information and supporting evidence as the regulations require, including certification by an appropriate medical authority as to the nature of the individual's illness and that the individual is not expected to live more than 9 months because of that illness.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) In order to ascertain the reliability of any medical opinion or finding submitted as part of an application under this section, the covered individual may be required to submit to a medical examination under the direction of the agency or entity considering the application. The individual shall not be liable for the costs associated with any examination required under this subparagraph.
<br>
<br>(B) Any decision by the reviewing agency or entity with respect to an application for benefits under this section (including one relating to an individual's medical prognosis) shall not be subject to administrative review.
<br>
<br>(4)(A) An individual making an election under this section may designate that only a limited portion (expressed as a multiple of $1,000) of the total amount otherwise allowable under this section be paid pursuant to such election.
<br>
<br>(B) A designation under this paragraph may not be made by an individual described in paragraph (1) or (2) of section 8706(b).
<br>
<br>(5) An election to receive benefits under this section shall be irrevocable, and not more than one such election may be made by any individual.
<br>
<br>(6) The regulations shall include provisions to address the question of how to apply section 8706(b)(3)(B) in the case of an electing individual who has attained 65 years of age.

<br>(g) A contract may not be made or a plan approved which does not offer to each employee, annuitant, family member, former spouse, or person having continued coverage under section 8905a of this title whose enrollment in the plan is ended, except by a cancellation of enrollment, a temporary extension of coverage during which he may exercise the option to convert, without evidence of good health, to a nongroup contract providing health benefits. An employee, annuitant, family member, former spouse, or person having continued coverage under section 8905a of this title who exercises this option shall pay the full periodic charges of the nongroup contract.
<br>
<br>(h) The benefits and coverage made available under subsection (g) of this section are noncancelable by the carrier except for fraud, over-insurance, or nonpayment of periodic charges.
<br>
<br>(i) Rates charged under health benefits plans described by section 8903 or 8903a of this title shall reasonably and equitably reflect the cost of the benefits provided. Rates under health benefits plans described by section 8903(1) and (2) of this title shall be determined on a basis which, in the judgment of the Office, is consistent with the lowest schedule of basic rates generally charged for new group health benefit plans issued to large employers. The rates determined for the first contract term shall be continued for later contract terms, except that they may be readjusted for any later term, based on past experience and benefit adjustments under the later contract. Any readjustment in rates shall be made in advance of the contract term in which they will apply and on a basis which, in the judgment of the Office, is consistent with the general practice of carriers which issue group health benefit plans to large employers.
<br>
<br>(j) Each contract under this chapter shall require the carrier to agree to pay for or provide a health service or supply in an individual case if the Office finds that the employee, annuitant, family member, former spouse, or person having continued coverage under section 8905a of this title is entitled thereto under the terms of the contract.
<br>
<br>(k)(1) When a contract under this chapter requires payment or reimbursement for services which may be performed by a clinical psychologist, optometrist, nurse midwife, nursing school administered clinic, or nurse practitioner/clinical specialist, licensed or certified as such under Federal or State law, as applicable, or by a qualified clinical social worker as defined in section 8901(11), an employee, annuitant, family member, former spouse, or person having continued coverage under section 8905a of this title covered by the contract shall be free to select, and shall have direct access to, such a clinical psychologist, qualified clinical social worker, optometrist, nurse midwife, nursing school administered clinic, or nurse practitioner/nurse clinical specialist without supervision or referral by another health practitioner and shall be entitled under the contract to have payment or reimbursement made to him or on his behalf for the services performed.
<br>
<br>(2) Nothing in this subsection shall be considered to preclude a health benefits plan from providing direct access or direct payment or reimbursement to a provider in a health care practice or profession other than a practice or profession listed in paragraph (1), if such provider is licensed or certified as such under Federal or State law.
<br>
<br>(3) The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to comprehensive medical plans as described in section 8903(4) of this title.
<br>
<br>(l) The Office shall contract under this chapter for a plan described in section 8903(4) of this title with any qualified health maintenance carrier which offers such a plan. For the purpose of this subsection, "qualified health maintenance carrier" means any qualified carrier which is a qualified health maintenance organization within the meaning of section 1310(d)(1) 1 of title XIII of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300c–9(d)).
<br>
<br>(m)(1) The terms of any contract under this chapter which relate to the nature, provision, or extent of coverage or benefits (including payments with respect to benefits) shall supersede and preempt any State or local law, or any regulation issued thereunder, which relates to health insurance or plans.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection, if a contract under this chapter provides for the provision of, the payment for, or the reimbursement of the cost of health services for the care and treatment of any particular health condition, the carrier shall provide, pay, or reimburse up to the limits of its contract for any such health service properly provided by any person licensed under State law to provide such service if such service is provided to an individual covered by such contract in a State where 25 percent or more of the population is located in primary medical care manpower shortage areas designated pursuant to section 332 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254e).
<br>
<br>(B) The provisions of subparagraph (A) shall not apply to contracts entered into providing prepayment plans described in section 8903(4) of this title.
<br>
<br>(n) A contract for a plan described by section 8903(1), (2), or (3), or section 8903a, shall require the carrier—
<br>
<br>(1) to implement hospitalization-cost-containment measures, such as measures—
<br>
<br>(A) for verifying the medical necessity of any proposed treatment or surgery;
<br>
<br>(B) for determining the feasibility or appropriateness of providing services on an outpatient rather than on an inpatient basis;
<br>
<br>(C) for determining the appropriate length of stay (through concurrent review or otherwise) in cases involving inpatient care; and
<br>
<br>(D) involving case management, if the circumstances so warrant; and
<br>
<br>(2) to establish incentives to encourage compliance with measures under paragraph (1).
<br>
<br>(o) A contract may not be made or a plan approved which includes coverage for any benefit, item, or service for which funds may not be used under the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act of 1997.
<br>
<br>(p) Each contract under this chapter shall require the carrier to comply with requirements described in the provisions of sections 2799A–1, 2799A–2, and 2799A–7 of the Public Health Service Act, sections 716, 717, and 722 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, and sections 9816, 9817, and 9822 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as applicable) in the same manner as such provisions apply to a group health plan or health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage, as described in such sections. The provisions of sections 2799B–1, 2799B–2, 2799B–3, and 2799B–5 of the Public Health Service Act shall apply to a health care provider and facility and an air ambulance provider described in such respective sections with respect to an enrollee in a health benefits plan under this chapter in the same manner as such provisions apply to such a provider and facility with respect to an enrollee in a group health plan or group or individual health insurance coverage offered by a health insurance issuer, as described in such sections.
