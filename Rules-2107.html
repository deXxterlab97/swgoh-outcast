<br>
<br>(b) Requirements.—Except as otherwise provided in this chapter or chapter 121 of this title, a vessel may not provide any part of the transportation of merchandise by water, or by land and water, between points in the United States to which the coastwise laws apply, either directly or via a foreign port, unless the vessel—
<br>
<br>(1) is wholly owned by citizens of the United States for purposes of engaging in the coastwise trade; and
<br>
<br>(2) has been issued a certificate of documentation with a coastwise endorsement under chapter 121 or is exempt from documentation but would otherwise be eligible for such a certificate and endorsement.
<br>
<br>(c) Penalty.—Merchandise transported in violation of subsection (b) is liable to seizure by and forfeiture to the Government. Alternatively, an amount equal to the value of the merchandise (as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security) or the actual cost of the transportation, whichever is greater, may be recovered from any person transporting the merchandise or causing the merchandise to be transported.

<br>
<br>In subsection (a)(1), the words "(as defined in section 2101 of the [sic] title 46)" are omitted because the definition of "State" is being moved to chapter 1 and will apply to the entire title.
<br>
<br>In subsection (b), the words "may not provide any part of the transportation of" are substituted for "No . . . shall be transported" and "or for any part of the transportation" because of the reorganization of the language. The words "including Districts, Territories, and possessions thereof" are omitted because of the definition of "United States" in chapter 1 of the revised title. The words "to which the coastwise laws apply" are substituted for "embraced within the coastwise laws" for consistency with section 55101. The words "is wholly owned by citizens of the United States for purposes of engaging in the coastwise trade" are substituted for "owned by persons who are citizens of the United States", and the words "has been issued a certificate of documentation with a coastwise endorsement under chapter 121" are substituted for "documented under the laws of the United States", for clarity and consistency in the revised title. The words "or is exempt from documentation but would otherwise be eligible for such a certificate and endorsement" are added for consistency with section 12102 as revised by the bill. The requirement that the vessel be built in the United States is omitted from this section for consistency with the requirements for a coastwise endorsement, which also require that the vessel be built in the United States except in certain circumstances. The words "or vessels to which the privilege of engaging in the coastwise trade is extended by section 808 of this Appendix or section 22 of this Act" are omitted because the relevant portion of section 808, and section 22, have been repealed.
<br>
<br>In subsection (c), the words "any person" are substituted for "any consignor, seller, owner, importer, consignee, agent, or other person or persons" to eliminate unnecessary words.

<br>(a) In General.—Except as otherwise provided in this chapter or chapter 121 of this title, a vessel may not transport passengers between ports or places in the United States to which the coastwise laws apply, either directly or via a foreign port, unless the vessel—
<br>
<br>(1) is wholly owned by citizens of the United States for purposes of engaging in the coastwise trade; and
<br>
<br>(2) has been issued a certificate of documentation with a coastwise endorsement under chapter 121 or is exempt from documentation but would otherwise be eligible for such a certificate and endorsement.

<br>
<br>(1) In general.—Subsection (a) does not apply to transportation performed by a foreign ocean incineration vessel owned by or under construction on May 1, 1982, for a corporation wholly owned by citizens of the United States under section 50501(a)–(c) of this title.
<br>

<br>
<br>(3) Inspection.—A vessel described in paragraph (1) shall be inspected by the Coast Guard, regardless of whether inspected by the nation in which it is registered. The inspection shall be the same as would be required of a vessel of the United States, including drydock inspection and internal examination of tanks and void spaces. The inspection may be made concurrently with an inspection by that nation or within one year after the initial issuance or next scheduled issuance of the Safety of Life at Sea Safety Construction Certificate. In making the inspection, the Coast Guard shall refer to the condition of the hull and superstructure established by the initial foreign certification as the basis for evaluating the current condition of the hull and superstructure. The Coast Guard shall allow the substitution of fittings, material, apparatus, equipment, and appliances different from those required for vessels of the United States if satisfied they are equivalent and at least as effective as those required for vessels of the United States. A satisfactory inspection under this paragraph shall be certified in writing by the Secretary of Homeland Security.

<br>(a) In General.—On terms and conditions the Secretary of Homeland Security may prescribe by regulation, the Secretary may suspend the application of section 55102 of this title to the transportation of merchandise that is transferred, when moving in the foreign trade of the United States, from a barge certified by the owner or operator as designed specifically for carriage on a vessel and carried regularly on a vessel in foreign trade, to another such barge owned or leased by the same owner or operator. However, this subsection does not apply to transportation between the continental United States and noncontiguous States, territories, or possessions to which the coastwise laws apply.
<br>
<br>(b) Reciprocity Requirement for Foreign Vessels.—This section applies to a vessel of foreign registry only if the Secretary of Homeland Security finds, based on information from the Secretary of State, that the government of the nation of registry extends reciprocal privileges to vessels of the United States.

<br>In subsection (a), the words "non-self-propelled" are omitted as unnecessary because of the definition of "barge" in chapter 1 of the revised title. The words "between points in the United States" and "without regard to whether any such barge is under foreign registry or qualified to engage in the coastwise trade" are omitted as surplus.
<br>§55107. Empty cargo containers and barges
<br>
<br>(a) In General.—Subject to subsections (b) and (c), and on terms and conditions the Secretary of Homeland Security may prescribe by regulation, section 55102 of this title does not apply to the transportation of—

<br>§55108. Platform jackets
<br>
<br>(a) Definitions.—In this section:
<br>
<br>(1) Coastwise qualified vessel.—The term "coastwise qualified vessel" means a vessel that has been issued a certificate of documentation with a coastwise endorsement under chapter 121 of this title.
<br>
<br>(2) Platform jacket.—The term "platform jacket" refers to a single physical component and includes any type of offshore exploration, development, or production structure or component thereof, including—
<br>
<br>(A) platform jackets;
<br>
<br>(B) tension leg or SPAR platform superstructures (including the deck, drilling rig and support utilities, and supporting structure);
<br>
<br>(C) hull (including vertical legs and connecting pontoons or vertical cylinder);
<br>
<br>(D) tower and base sections of a platform jacket;
<br>
<br>(E) jacket structures; and
<br>
<br>(F) deck modules (known as "topsides").
<br>
<br>(b) Authorized Transportation.—Section 55102 of this title does not apply to the transportation of a platform jacket in or on a non-coastwise qualified launch barge between two points in the United States, at one of which there is an installation or other device within the meaning of section 4(a) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1333(a)), if—
<br>
<br>(1) the launch barge was built before December 31, 2000, and has a launch capacity of at least 12,000 long tons; and
<br>
<br>(2) the Secretary of Transportation makes a determination, in accordance with procedures established under subsection (c), that a suitable coastwise qualified vessel is not available for use in the transportation and, if needed, launch or installation of a platform jacket.
<br>
<br>(c) Procedures To Maximize Use of Coastwise Qualified Vessels.—The Secretary of Transportation shall adopt procedures implementing this section that are reasonably designed to provide timely information so as to maximize the use of coastwise qualified vessels. The procedures shall, among other things, establish that for purposes of this section, a coastwise qualified vessel shall be deemed to be not available only if—
<br>
<br>(1) on application by an owner or operator for the use of a non-coastwise qualified launch barge for transportation of a platform jacket under this section (which application shall include all relevant information, including engineering details and timing requirements), the Secretary promptly publishes a notice in the Federal Register—
<br>
<br>(A) describing the project and the platform jacket involved;
<br>
<br>(B) advising that all relevant information reasonably needed to assess the transportation requirements for the platform jacket will be made available to interested parties on request; and
<br>
<br>(C) requesting that information on the availability of coastwise qualified vessels be submitted within 30 days after publication of that notice; and
<br>
<br>(2)(A) no information is submitted to the Secretary within that 30 day period; or
<br>
<br>(B) the owner or operator of a coastwise qualified vessel submits information to the Secretary asserting that the owner or operator has a suitable coastwise qualified vessel available for the transportation, but the Secretary determines, within 90 days after the notice is first published, that the coastwise qualified vessel is not suitable or reasonably available for the transportation.

<br>
<br>(a) In General.—Except as provided in subsection (b), a vessel may engage in dredging in the navigable waters of the United States only if—

<br>(1) the vessel is wholly owned by citizens of the United States for purposes of engaging in the coastwise trade;
<br>
<br>(2) the charterer, if any, is a citizen of the United States for purposes of engaging in the coastwise trade; and

<br>
<br>Subsection (a)(1) is substituted for "(1) the vessel meets the requirements of section 883 of this Appendix and sections 802 and 803 of this Appendix for engaging in the coastwise trade" for consistency with other sections of the revised title and to eliminate unnecessary words. Section 883 requires (among other things) that the vessel be owned by citizens of the United States, and section 802 contains the requirements for certain entities to qualify as citizens. Those requirements are restated in section 50501 which applies to this section. Section 883 also requires that the vessel be built in and documented under the laws of the United States. Those latter two requirements are covered by subsection (a)(3). Note that the build requirement is a requirement for a coastwise endorsement.
<br>
<br>In subsection (a)(3), the words "or is exempt from documentation but would otherwise be eligible for such a certificate and endorsement" are added for consistency with section 12102 as revised by the bill.

L. 109–304] amends section 5501(a) of the Oceans Act of 1992 (Public Law 102–587, 106 Stat. 5084) [see note above] by adding a new paragraph (3). The intent of this amendment is to maintain the status quo under paragraph (2) of section 5501(a) of that Act, as it exists prior to the enactment of this codification legislation. Section 55109 of title 46, United States Code, as contained in this bill, is intended as a codification without substantive change of section 1 of the Act of May 28, 1906, as amended (46 App. U.S.C. 292). Therefore, the exceptions from that latter provision, which currently exist under such paragraph (2), are intended to continue to exist to the same extent under new section 55109 of title 46. In addition, if the original intent of such paragraph (2) was that the restriction contained in the pre-1992 amended version of that 1906 provision continues to apply to the vessels, persons, and entities described in such paragraph (2), then that outcome is intended to remain unchanged by this legislation, despite the repeal by this legislation of that 1906 provision. No expression as to the original intent of such paragraph (2) is intended by this legislation.]

The words "However, the foreign railroad is subject to the same restrictions imposed by law on a vessel of the United States entering a port of the United States from the same foreign country" are substituted for "without being subject to any other or different restrictions than those imposed by law on any vessel of the United States entering ports of the United States from ports in the same foreign country" to eliminate unnecessary words. The words "Except as otherwise authorized by this chapter" are substituted for "except as authorized by section 883 of this Appendix" because of the reorganization of the source material in the revised title. The words "its Territories or possessions" are omitted as unnecessary because of the definition of "United States" in chapter 1 of the revised title.

<br>
<br>This section codifies the Joint Resolution of March 26, 1934 (ch. 90, 48 Stat. 500) (also commonly known as Public Resolution 17). The codification of this provision is not intended to change its status as a "Sense of Congress" provision in any way. The words "Reconstruction Finance Corporation or" are omitted as obsolete because the Reconstruction Finance Corporation was abolished by section 6 of Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1957 (5 App. U.S.C.).
<br>§55305. Cargoes procured, furnished, or financed by the United States Government
<br>
<br>(a) Definition.—In this section, the term "privately-owned commercial vessel of the United States" does not include a vessel that, after September 21, 1961, was built or rebuilt outside the United States or documented under the laws of a foreign country, until the vessel has been documented under the laws of the United States for at least 3 years.

<br>(b) Minimum Tonnage.—When the United States Government procures, contracts for, or otherwise obtains for its own account, or furnishes to or for the account of a foreign country, organization, or persons without provision for reimbursement, any equipment, materials, or commodities, or provides financing in any way with Federal funds for the account of any persons unless otherwise exempted, within or without the United States, or advances funds or credits, or guarantees the convertibility of foreign currencies in connection with the furnishing or obtaining of the equipment, materials, or commodities, the appropriate agencies shall take steps necessary and practicable to ensure that at least 50 percent of the gross tonnage of the equipment, materials, or commodities (computed separately for dry bulk carriers, dry cargo liners, and tankers) which may be transported on ocean vessels is transported on privately-owned commercial vessels of the United States, to the extent those vessels are available at fair and reasonable rates for commercial vessels of the United States, in a manner that will ensure a fair and reasonable participation of commercial vessels of the United States in those cargoes by geographic areas.
<br>
<br>(c) Waivers.—The President, the Secretary of Defense, or Congress (by concurrent resolution or otherwise) may waive this section temporarily by—
<br>
<br>(1) declaring the existence of an emergency justifying a waiver; and
<br>
<br>(2) notifying the appropriate agencies of the waiver.
<br>
<br>(d) Programs of Other Agencies.—
<br>
<br>(1) Each department or agency that has responsibility for a program under this section shall administer that program with respect to this section under regulations and guidance issued by the Secretary of Transportation. The Secretary, after consulting with the department or agency or organization or person involved, shall have the sole responsibility for determining if a program is subject to the requirements of this section.
<br>
<br>(2) The Secretary—
<br>
<br>(A) shall conduct an annual review of the administration of programs determined pursuant to paragraph (1) as subject to the requirements of this section;
<br>
<br>(B) may direct agencies to require the transportation on United States-flagged vessels of cargo shipments not otherwise subject to this section in equivalent amounts to cargo determined to have been shipped on foreign carriers in violation of this section;
<br>
<br>(C) may impose on any person that violates this section, or a regulation prescribed under this section, a civil penalty of not more than $25,000 for each violation willfully and knowingly committed, with each day of a continuing violation following the date of shipment to be a separate violation; and
<br>
<br>(D) may take other measures as appropriate under the Federal Acquisition Regulations issued pursuant to section 25(c)(1) 1 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 1303(a)(1)) or contract with respect to each violation.
<br>
<br>(e) Security of Government-Impelled Cargo.—
<br>
<br>(1) In order to ensure the safety of vessels and crewmembers transporting equipment, materials, or commodities under this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall direct each department or agency (except the Department of Defense), when responsible for the carriage of such equipment, materials, or commodities, to reimburse, subject to the availability of appropriations, the owners or operators of vessels of the United States carrying such equipment, materials, or commodities for the cost of providing armed personnel aboard such vessels if the vessels are transiting high-risk waters.
<br>
<br>(2) In this subsection, the term "high-risk waters" means waters so designated by the Commandant of the Coast Guard in the maritime security directive issued by the Commandant and in effect on the date on which an applicable voyage begins, if the Secretary of Transportation—
<br>
<br>(A) determines that an act of piracy occurred in the 12-month period preceding the date the voyage begins; or
<br>
<br>(B) in such period, issued an advisory warning that an act of piracy is possible in such waters.

<br>(1) a productive and healthy agricultural industry and a strong and active United States maritime industry are vitally important to the economic well-being and security of the United States;
<br>
<br>(2) both industries must compete in international markets increasingly dominated by foreign trade barriers and the subsidization practices of foreign governments; and
<br>
<br>(3) increased agricultural exports and the use of merchant vessels of the United States contribute positively to the United States balance of trade and generate employment opportunities in the United States.
<br>
<br>(b) Purposes.—The purposes of this subchapter are to—
<br>
<br>(1) enable the Secretary of Agriculture to plan export programs effectively, by clarifying the ocean transportation requirements applicable to those programs;
<br>
<br>(2) take immediate and positive steps to promote the growth of the cargo-carrying capacity of the United States merchant marine;
<br>
<br>(3) expand international trade in United States agricultural commodities and products and develop, maintain, and expand markets for United States agricultural exports;
<br>
<br>(4) improve the efficiency of administration of both the commodity purchasing and selling activities and the ocean transportation activities associated with export programs sponsored by the Secretary;
<br>
<br>(5) stimulate and promote the agricultural and maritime industries of the United States and encourage cooperative efforts by both industries to address their common problems; and
<br>
<br>(6) provide for the appropriate disposition of these findings and purposes.
