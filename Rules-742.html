<br>
<br>The Board may prescribe regulations, pursuant to section 553 of title 5, regarding any interchange transaction fee that an issuer may receive or charge with respect to an electronic debit transaction, to implement this subsection (including related definitions), and to prevent circumvention or evasion of this subsection.
<br>(2) Reasonable interchange transaction fees
<br>
<br>The amount of any interchange transaction fee that an issuer may receive or charge with respect to an electronic debit transaction shall be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer with respect to the transaction.
<br>(3) Rulemaking required
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The Board shall prescribe regulations in final form not later than 9 months after July 21, 2010, to establish standards for assessing whether the amount of any interchange transaction fee described in paragraph (2) is reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer with respect to the transaction.
<br>(B) Information collection
<br>
<br>The Board may require any issuer (or agent of an issuer) or payment card network to provide the Board with such information as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this subsection and the Board, in issuing rules under subparagraph (A) and on at least a bi-annual basis thereafter, shall disclose such aggregate or summary information concerning the costs incurred, and interchange transaction fees charged or received, by issuers or payment card networks in connection with the authorization, clearance or settlement of electronic debit transactions as the Board considers appropriate and in the public interest.
<br>(4) Considerations; consultation
<br>
<br>In prescribing regulations under paragraph (3)(A), the Board shall—

<br>(ii) checking transactions that are required within the Federal Reserve bank system to clear at par;
<br>
<br>(B) distinguish between—
<br>
<br>(i) the incremental cost incurred by an issuer for the role of the issuer in the authorization, clearance, or settlement of a particular electronic debit transaction, which cost shall be considered under paragraph (2); and
<br>
<br>(ii) other costs incurred by an issuer which are not specific to a particular electronic debit transaction, which costs shall not be considered under paragraph (2); and
<br>
<br>(C) consult, as appropriate, with the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, the National Credit Union Administration Board, the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, and the Director of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection.
<br>(5) Adjustments to interchange transaction fees for fraud prevention costs

<br>
<br>(ii) the issuer complies with the fraud-related standards established by the Board under subparagraph (B), which standards shall—
<br>
<br>(I) be designed to ensure that any fraud-related adjustment of the issuer is limited to the amount described in clause (i) and takes into account any fraud-related reimbursements (including amounts from charge-backs) received from consumers, merchants, or payment card networks in relation to electronic debit transactions involving the issuer; and

<br>
<br>(V) the costs of fraudulent transactions absorbed by each party involved in such transactions (including consumers, persons who accept debit cards as a form of payment, financial institutions, retailers and payment card networks);

<br>§1693q. Relation to State laws
<br>
<br>This subchapter does not annul, alter, or affect the laws of any State relating to electronic fund transfers, dormancy fees, inactivity charges or fees, service fees, or expiration dates of gift certificates, store gift cards, or general-use prepaid cards, except to the extent that those laws are inconsistent with the provisions of this subchapter, and then only to the extent of the inconsistency. A State law is not inconsistent with this subchapter if the protection such law affords any consumer is greater than the protection afforded by this subchapter. The Bureau shall, upon its own motion or upon the request of any financial institution, State, or other interested party, submitted in accordance with procedures prescribed in regulations of the Bureau, determine whether a State requirement is inconsistent or affords greater protection. If the Bureau determines that a State requirement is inconsistent, financial institutions shall incur no liability under the law of that State for a good faith failure to comply with that law, notwithstanding that such determination is subsequently amended, rescinded, or determined by judicial or other authority to be invalid for any reason. This subchapter does not extend the applicability of any such law to any class of persons or transactions to which it would not otherwise apply.

<br>

<br>(D) to display or deliver to prospective purchasers or lessees advertising and promotional material which is inconsistent with information required to be disclosed in the property report; or

<br>Except as hereinafter provided, the effective date of a statement of record, or any amendment thereto, shall be the thirtieth day after the filing thereof or such earlier date as the Director may determine, having due regard to the public interest and the protection of purchasers. If any amendment to any such statement is filed prior to the effective date of the statement, the statement shall be deemed to have been filed when such amendment was filed; except that such an amendment filed with the consent of the Director, or filed pursuant to an order of the Director, shall be treated as being filed as of the date of the filing of the statement of record.

At the time of consolidation the developer shall include in the consolidated statement of record any material changes in the information contained in the earlier statement.
<br>(b) Incomplete or inaccurate statements of record
<br>
<br>If it appears to the Director that a statement of record, or any amendment thereto, is on its face incomplete or inaccurate in any material respect, the Director shall so advise the developer within a reasonable time after the filing of the statement or the amendment, but prior to the date the statement or amendment would otherwise be effective. Such notification shall serve to suspend the effective date of the statement or the amendment until thirty days after the developer files such additional information as the Director shall require. Any developer, upon receipt of such notice, may request a hearing, and such hearing shall be held within twenty days of receipt of such request by the Director.
<br>(c) Amendment of statement of record
<br>
<br>If, at any time subsequent to the effective date of a statement of record, a change shall occur affecting any material fact required to be contained in the statement, the developer shall promptly file an amendment thereto.

<br>(d) Suspension of statement of record containing untrue statement or omission to state material fact; notice and hearing; termination of order of suspension
<br>
<br>If it appears to the Director at any time that a statement of record, which is in effect, includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, the Director may, after notice, and after opportunity for hearing (at a time fixed by the Director) within fifteen days after such notice, issue an order suspending the statement of record. When such statement has been amended in accordance with such order, the Director shall so declare and thereupon the order shall cease to be effective.
<br>(e) Examination to determine issuance of order; access to records; order suspending statement of record upon failure to cooperate
<br>
<br>The Director is hereby empowered to make an examination in any case to determine whether an order should issue under subsection (d). In making such examination, the Director or anyone designated by him shall have access to and may demand the production of any books and papers of, and may administer oaths and affirmations to and examine, the developer, any agents or any other person, in respect of any matter relevant to the examination. If the developer or any agents shall fail to cooperate, or shall obstruct or refuse to permit the making of an examination, such conduct shall be proper ground for the issuance of an order suspending the statement of record.
<br>(f) Service of notices
<br>
<br>Any notice required under this section shall be sent to or served on the developer or his authorized agent.

<br>§1708. Certification of substantially equivalent State law
<br>(a) Criteria; request by State
<br>
<br>(1) A State shall be certified if the Director determines—
<br>
<br>(A) that, when taken as a whole, the laws and regulations of the State applicable to the sale or lease of lots not exempt under section 1702 of this title require the seller or lessor of such lots to disclose information which is at least substantially equivalent to the information required to be disclosed by section 1707 of this title; and
<br>
<br>(B) that the State's administration of such laws and regulations provides, to the maximum extent practicable, that such information is accurate.
<br>
<br>(2) In the case of any State which is not certified under paragraph (1), such State shall be certified if the Director determines—
<br>
<br>(A) that, when taken as a whole, the laws and regulations of the State applicable to the sale or lease of lots not exempt under section 1702 of this title provide sufficient protection for purchasers and lessees with respect to the matters for which information is required to be disclosed by section 1707 of this title but which is not required to be disclosed by such State's laws and regulations; and
<br>
<br>(B) that the State's administration of such laws and regulations provides, to the maximum extent practicable, that (i) information required to be disclosed by such laws and regulations is accurate, and (ii) sufficient protection for purchasers and lessees is made available with respect to the matters for which information is not required to be disclosed.
<br>
<br>(3) Any State requesting certification must agree to accept a property report covering land located in another certified State but offered for sale or lease in the State requesting certification if the property report has been approved by the other certified State. Such property report shall be the only property report required by the State with respect to the sale or lease of such land.
<br>(b) Filing of State disclosure materials and related documentation for purposes of Federal statement of record and property report requirements; acceptance by Director
<br>
<br>After the Director has certified a State under subsection (a), the Director shall accept for filing under sections 1704 through 1707 of this title (and declare effective as the Federal statement of record and property report which shall be used in all States in which the lots are offered for sale or lease) disclosure materials found acceptable, and any related documentation required, by State authorities in connection with the sale or lease of lots located within the State. The Director may accept for such filing, and declare effective as the Federal statement of record and property report, such materials and documentation found acceptable by the State in connection with the sale or lease of lots located outside that State. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the Director from exercising the authority conferred by subsections (d) and (e) of section 1706 of this title.
<br>(c) Notice to State upon failure to meet requirements and remedial action necessary for certification
<br>
<br>If a State fails to meet the standards for certification pursuant to subsection (a), the Director shall notify the State in writing of the changes in State law, regulation, or administration that are needed in order to obtain certification.
<br>(d) Periodic review of certified States' laws, regulations, and administration; withdrawal of certification
<br>
<br>The Director shall periodically review the laws and regulations, and the administration thereof, of States certified under subsection (a), and may withdraw such certification upon a determination that such laws, regulations, and the administration thereof, taken as a whole, no longer meet the requirements of subsection (a).
<br>(e) State and local governmental authorities affected; cooperation with State authorities
<br>
<br>Nothing in this chapter may be construed to prevent or limit the authority of any State or local government to enact and enforce with regard to the sale of land any law, ordinance, or code not in conflict with this chapter. In administering this chapter, the Director shall cooperate with State authorities charged with the responsibility of regulating the sale or lease of lots which are subject to this chapter.

A copy of such petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Director, and thereupon the Director shall file in the court the record upon which the order or determination complained of was entered, as provided in section 2112 of title 28.

And such court may issue an order requiring such person to appear before the Director or any officer designated by the Director, there to produce records, if so ordered, or to give testimony touching the matter under investigation or in question; and any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof. All process in any such case may be served in the judicial district whereof such person is an inhabitant or wherever he may be found.
