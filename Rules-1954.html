<br>
<br>(e) Calculation.—An adjustment under this section shall be—
<br>
<br>(1) calculated on the basis of changes in the Consumer Price Index for all-urban consumers published monthly by the Secretary of Labor; and
<br>
<br>(2) rounded, in the case of a dollar threshold that as calculated under paragraph (1) is—
<br>
<br>(A) less than $10,000, to the nearest $500;

<br>
<br>(A) shall determine, in writing, whether the dollar threshold is required to be adjusted under this section; and
<br>
<br>(B) on determining that it should be adjusted, shall publish in the Federal Register a revised notice of the adjustment dollar thresholds under this section that includes the adjustment of the dollar threshold covered by the petition.

<br>
<br>(1) There is a record in each executive agency of each holder of a purchase card issued by the agency for official use, annotated with the limitations on single transactions and total transactions that are applicable to the use of each such card or check by that purchase card holder.

<br>(4) Any disputed purchase card charge, and any discrepancy between a receipt and other supporting documentation and the purchase card statement of account, is resolved in the manner prescribed in the applicable Government-wide purchase card contract entered into by the Administrator of General Services.
<br>
<br>(5) Payments on purchase card accounts are made promptly within prescribed deadlines to avoid interest penalties.

<br>(8) Periodic reviews are performed to determine whether each purchase card holder has a need for the purchase card.
<br>

<br>(10) The executive agency has specific policies regarding the number of purchase cards issued by various component organizations and categories of component organizations, the credit limits authorized for various categories of card holders, and categories of employees eligible to be issued purchase cards, and that those policies are designed to minimize the financial risk to the Federal Government of the issuance of the purchase cards and to ensure the integrity of purchase card holders.
<br>
<br>(11) The executive agency uses effective systems, techniques, and technologies to prevent or identify illegal, improper, or erroneous purchases.
<br>
<br>(12) The executive agency invalidates the purchase card of each employee who—

<br>
<br>(B) transfers to another unit of the agency, immediately upon the transfer of the employee unless the agency determines that the units are covered by the same purchase card authority.
<br>
<br>(13) The executive agency takes steps to recover the cost of any illegal, improper, or erroneous purchase made with a purchase card or convenience check by an employee, including, as necessary, through salary offsets.

<br>Executive Documents
<br>Streamlining Procurement Through Electronic Commerce
<br>
<br>Memorandum of President of the United States, Oct. 28, 1993, 58 F.R. 58095, provided:
<br>
<br>Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies [and] the President's Management Council
<br>
<br>The Federal Government spends $200 billion annually buying goods and services. Unfortunately, the red tape and burdensome paperwork of the current procurement system increases costs, produces unnecessary delays, and reduces Federal work force productivity. Moving to an electronic commerce system to simplify and streamline the purchasing process will promote customer service and cost-effectiveness. The electronic exchange of acquisition information between the private sector and the Federal Government also will increase competition by improving access to Federal contracting opportunities for the more than 300,000 vendors currently doing business with the Government, particularly small businesses, as well as many other vendors who find access to bidding opportunities difficult under the current system. For these reasons, I am committed to fundamentally altering and improving the way the Federal Government buys goods and services by ensuring that electronic commerce is implemented for appropriate Federal purchases as quickly as possible.
<br>
<br>1. OBJECTIVES.
<br>
<br>The objectives of this electronic commerce initiative are to:
<br>
<br>(a) exchange procurement information—such as solicitations, offers, contracts, purchase orders, invoices, payments, and other contractual documents—electronically between the private sector and the Federal Government to the maximum extent practical;
<br>
<br>(b) provide businesses, including small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned businesses, with greater access to Federal procurement opportunities;
<br>
<br>(c) ensure that potential suppliers are provided simplified access to the Federal Government's electronic commerce system;
<br>
<br>(d) employ nationally and internationally recognized data formats that serve to broaden and ease the electronic interchange of data; and
<br>
<br>(e) use agency and industry systems and networks to enable the Government and potential suppliers to exchange information and access Federal procurement data.
<br>
<br>2. IMPLEMENTATION.
<br>
<br>The President's Management Council, in coordination with the Office of Federal Procurement Policy of the Office of Management and Budget, and in consultation with appropriate Federal agencies with applicable technical and functional expertise, as necessary, shall provide overall leadership, management oversight, and policy direction to implement electronic commerce in the executive branch through the following actions:
<br>
<br>(a) by March 1994, define the architecture for the Government-wide electronic commerce acquisition system and identify executive departments or agencies responsible for developing, implementing, operating, and maintaining the Federal electronic system;
<br>
<br>(b) by September 1994, establish an initial electronic commerce capability to enable the Federal Government and private vendors to electronically exchange standardized requests for quotations, quotes, purchase orders, and notice of awards and begin Government-wide implementation;
<br>
<br>(c) by July 1995, implement a full scale Federal electronic commerce system that expands initial capabilities to include electronic payments, document interchange, and supporting databases; and
<br>
<br>(d) by January 1997, complete Government-wide implementation of electronic commerce for appropriate Federal purchases, to the maximum extent possible.
<br>
<br>This implementation schedule should be accelerated where practicable.
<br>
<br>The head of each executive department or agency shall:
<br>
<br>(a) ensure that budgetary resources are available, within approved budget levels, for electronic commerce implementation in each respective department or agency;
<br>

<br>§2302. Rights in technical data
<br>
<br>(a) Where Defined.—The legitimate proprietary interest of the Federal Government and of a contractor in technical or other data shall be defined in regulations prescribed as part of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.
<br>
<br>(b) General Extent of Regulations.—
<br>
<br>(1) Other rights not impaired.—Regulations prescribed under subsection (a) may not impair a right of the Federal Government or of a contractor with respect to a patent or copyright or another right in technical data otherwise established by law.
<br>
<br>(2) Limitation on requiring data be provided to the government.—With respect to executive agencies subject to division C, regulations prescribed under subsection (a) shall provide that the Federal Government may not require a person that has developed a product (or process offered or to be offered for sale to the public) to provide to the Federal Government technical data relating to the design (or development or manufacture of the product or process) as a condition of procurement by the Federal Government of the product or process. This paragraph does not apply to data that may be necessary for the Federal Government to operate and maintain the product or use the process if the Federal Government obtains it as an element of performance under the contract.
<br>
<br>(c) Technical Data Developed With Federal Funds.—
<br>
<br>(1) Use by government and agencies.—Except as otherwise expressly provided by Federal statute, with respect to executive agencies subject to division C, regulations prescribed under subsection (a) shall provide that—
<br>
<br>(A) the Federal Government has unlimited rights in technical data developed exclusively with Federal funds if delivery of the data—
<br>
<br>(i) was required as an element of performance under a contract; and
<br>
<br>(ii) is needed to ensure the competitive acquisition of supplies or services that will be required in substantial quantities in the future; and
<br>
<br>(B) the Federal Government and each agency of the Federal Government has an unrestricted, royalty-free right to use, or to have its contractors use, for governmental purposes (excluding publication outside the Federal Government) technical data developed exclusively with Federal funds.
<br>
<br>(2) Requirements in addition to other rights of the government.—The requirements of paragraph (1) are in addition to and not in lieu of any other rights the Federal Government may have pursuant to law.
<br>
<br>(d) Factors To Be Considered in Prescribing Regulations.—The following factors shall be considered in prescribing regulations under subsection (a):
<br>
<br>(1) Whether the item or process to which the technical data pertains was developed—
<br>
<br>(A) exclusively with Federal funds;
<br>
<br>(B) exclusively at private expense; or
<br>
<br>(C) in part with Federal funds and in part at private expense.
<br>
<br>(2) The statement of congressional policy and objectives in section 200 of title 35, the statement of purposes in section 2(b) of the Small Business Innovation Development Act of 1982 (Public Law 97–219, 15 U.S.C. 638 note), and the declaration of policy in section 2 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 631).
<br>
<br>(3) The interest of the Federal Government in increasing competition and lowering costs by developing and locating alternative sources of supply and manufacture.
<br>
<br>(e) Provisions Required in Contracts.—Regulations prescribed under subsection (a) shall require that a contract for property or services entered into by an executive agency contain appropriate provisions relating to technical data, including provisions—
<br>
<br>(1) defining the respective rights of the Federal Government and the contractor or subcontractor (at any tier) regarding technical data to be delivered under the contract;
<br>
<br>(2) specifying technical data to be delivered under the contract and schedules for delivery;
<br>
<br>(3) establishing or referencing procedures for determining the acceptability of technical data to be delivered under the contract;
<br>
<br>(4) establishing separate contract line items for technical data to be delivered under the contract;
<br>
<br>(5) to the maximum practicable extent, identifying, in advance of delivery, technical data which is to be delivered with restrictions on the right of the Federal Government to use the data;
<br>
<br>(6) requiring the contractor to revise any technical data delivered under the contract to reflect engineering design changes made during the performance of the contract and affecting the form, fit, and function of the items specified in the contract and to deliver the revised technical data to an agency within a time specified in the contract;
<br>
<br>(7) requiring the contractor to furnish written assurance, when technical data is delivered or is made available, that the technical data is complete and accurate and satisfies the requirements of the contract concerning technical data;
<br>
<br>(8) establishing remedies to be available to the Federal Government when technical data required to be delivered or made available under the contract is found to be incomplete or inadequate or to not satisfy the requirements of the contract concerning technical data; and
<br>
<br>(9) authorizing the head of the agency to withhold payments under the contract (or exercise another remedy the head of the agency considers appropriate) during any period if the contractor does not meet the requirements of the contract pertaining to the delivery of technical data.

<br>
<br>(2) Elements of policy.—The policy shall—
<br>
<br>(A) define "personal conflict of interest" as it relates to contractor employees performing relevant acquisition functions; and
<br>
<br>(B) require each contractor whose employees perform relevant acquisition functions to—
<br>
<br>(i) identify and prevent personal conflicts of interest for the employees;
<br>
<br>(ii) prohibit contractor employees who have access to non-public government information obtained while performing relevant acquisition functions from using the information for personal gain;
<br>
<br>(iii) report any personal conflict-of-interest violation by an employee to the applicable contracting officer or contracting officer's representative as soon as it is identified;
<br>
<br>(iv) maintain effective oversight to verify compliance with personal conflict-of-interest safeguards;

<br>
<br>(vi) take appropriate disciplinary action in the case of employees who fail to comply with policies established pursuant to this section.
<br>
<br>(3) Contract clause.—
<br>
<br>(A) Contents.—The Administrator shall develop a personal conflicts-of-interest clause or a set of clauses for inclusion in solicitations and contracts (and task or delivery orders) for the performance of relevant acquisition functions that sets forth—

<br>(i) the personal conflicts-of-interest policy developed under this subsection; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the contractor's responsibilities under the policy.
<br>
<br>(B) Effective date.—Subparagraph (A) shall take effect 300 days after October 14, 2008, and shall apply to—
<br>
<br>(i) contracts entered into on or after that effective date; and

<br>(ii) task or delivery orders awarded on or after that effective date, regardless of whether the contracts pursuant to which the task or delivery orders are awarded are entered before, on, or after October 14, 2008.
<br>
<br>(4) Applicability.—
<br>
<br>(A) Contracts in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold.—This subsection shall apply to any contract for an amount in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold (as defined in section 134 of this title) if the contract is for the performance of relevant acquisition functions.
<br>
<br>(B) Partial applicability.—If only a portion of a contract described in subparagraph (A) is for the performance of relevant acquisition functions, then this subsection applies only to that portion of the contract.
<br>
<br>(c) Best Practices.—The Administrator shall, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Government Ethics, develop and maintain a repository of best practices relating to the prevention and mitigation of organizational and personal conflicts of interest in Federal contracting.

<br>"(i) address personal conflicts of interest by contractor employees with respect to functions other than those described in subsection (a) [now 41 U.S.C. 2303(b)]; or
<br>
<br>"(ii) achieve sufficiently rigorous, comprehensive, and uniform government-wide policies to prevent and mitigate organizational conflicts of interest in Federal contracting.
<br>

<br>
<br>"(3) Report.—Not later than March 1, 2010, the Administrator shall submit to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and House of Representatives, the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs in the Senate, and the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the House of Representatives a report setting forth such findings and determinations under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1), together with an assessment of any revisions to the Federal Acquisition Regulation that may be necessary."

<br>
<br>(b) Services Subject to Regulations.—Regulations required by subsection (a) apply to—
<br>

<br>
<br>(2) services related to support of the preparation or submission of bids and proposals for Federal contracts to the extent that inclusion of the services in the regulations is necessary to identify and evaluate the potential for conflicts of interest that could be prejudicial to the interests of the United States; and
<br>
<br>(3) other services related to Federal contracts as specified in the regulations prescribed under subsection (a) to the extent necessary to identify and evaluate the potential for conflicts of interest that could be prejudicial to the interests of the United States.

<br>§2308. Modular contracting for information technology
<br>
<br>(a) Use.—To the maximum extent practicable, the head of an executive agency should use modular contracting for an acquisition of a major system of information technology.
<br>
<br>(b) Modular Contracting Described.—Under modular contracting, an executive agency's need for a system is satisfied in successive acquisitions of interoperable increments. Each increment complies with common or commercially accepted standards applicable to information technology so that the increments are compatible with other increments of information technology comprising the system.
<br>
<br>(c) Provisions in Federal Acquisition Regulation.—The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall provide that—
<br>
<br>(1) under the modular contracting process, an acquisition of a major system of information technology may be divided into several smaller acquisition increments that—
<br>
<br>(A) are easier to manage individually than would be one comprehensive acquisition;
<br>
<br>(B) address complex information technology objectives incrementally in order to enhance the likelihood of achieving workable solutions for attaining those objectives;
<br>
<br>(C) provide for delivery, implementation, and testing of workable systems or solutions in discrete increments, each of which comprises a system or solution that is not dependent on a subsequent increment in order to perform its principal functions; and
<br>
<br>(D) provide an opportunity for subsequent increments of the acquisition to take advantage of any evolution in technology or needs that occurs during conduct of the earlier increments;
<br>
<br>(2) to the maximum extent practicable, a contract for an increment of an information technology acquisition should be awarded within 180 days after the solicitation is issued and, if the contract for that increment cannot be awarded within that period, the increment should be considered for cancellation; and
<br>
<br>(3) the information technology provided for in a contract for acquisition of information technology should be delivered within 18 months after the solicitation resulting in award of the contract was issued.

<br>
<br>(a) Prohibition on Requiring Waiver of Rights.—A contractor may not be required, as a condition for entering into a contract with the Federal Government, to waive a right under the Constitution for a purpose relating to the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6701 et seq.) or the Chemical Weapons Convention (as defined in section 3 of that Act (22 U.S.C. 6701)).

<br>
<br>(a) Criteria.—A performance-based contract for the procurement of services entered into by an executive agency or a performance-based task order for services issued by an executive agency may be treated as a contract for the procurement of commercial items if—

<br>(B) identifies the specific end products or output to be achieved; and
<br>
<br>(C) contains firm, fixed prices for specific tasks to be performed or outcomes to be achieved; and
