<br>6I will wash my hands in innocency; So will I compass Thine altar, O
<br>LORD,
<br>7That I may make the voice of thanksgiving to be heard,
<br>And tell of all Thy wondrous works.
<br>
<br>8LORD, I love the habitation of Thy house,
<br>And the place where Thy glory dwelleth.
<br>9Gather not my soul with sinners, Nor my life with men of blood;
<br> 
<br>10In whose hands is craftiness,
<br>And their right hand is full of bribes.
<br>11But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity;
<br>Redeem me, and be gracious unto me.
<br>12My foot standeth in an even place; In the congregations will I bless the
<br>LORD.
<br>27	[A Psalm] of David.
<br>The LORD is my light and my
<br>salvation; whom shall I fear?
<br>The LORD is the stronghold of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?
<br>2When evil-doers came upon me to eat up my flesh,
<br>Even mine adversaries and my foes, they stumbled and fell.
<br>3Though a host should encamp against me,
<br>My heart shall not fear;
<br>Though war should rise up against me,
<br>Even then will I be confident.
<br>
<br>4One thing have I asked of the LORD, that will I seek after:
<br>That I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life,
<br>To behold the graciousness of the LORD, and to visit early in His temple.
<br>5For He concealeth me in His pavilion in the day of evil;
<br>He hideth me in the covert of His tent;
<br>He lifteth me up upon a rock.
<br> 
<br>6And now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me;
<br>And I will offer in His tabernacle sacrifices with trumpet-sound;
<br>I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD.
<br>
<br>7Hear, O LORD, when I call with my voice,
<br>And be gracious unto me, and answer me.
<br>8In Thy behalf my heart hath said: ‘Seek ye My face';
<br>Thy face, LORD, will I seek.
<br>9Hide not Thy face far from me; Put not Thy servant away in anger; Thou hast been my help;
<br>Cast me not off, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.
<br>10For though my father and my mother have forsaken me,
<br>The LORD will take me up.
<br>
<br>11Teach me Thy way, O LORD; And lead me in an even path,
<br>Because of them that lie in wait for me.
<br>12Deliver me not over unto the will of mine adversaries;
<br>For false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out violence.
<br>13If I had not believed to look upon the goodness of the LORD
<br>In the land of the living!—
<br>14Wait on the LORD;
<br>Be strong, and let thy heart take courage;
<br> 
<br>Yea, wait thou for the LORD.
<br>28	[A Psalm] of David.
<br>Unto thee, O LORD, do I call;
<br>My Rock, be not Thou deaf unto me;
<br>Lest, if Thou be silent unto me,
<br>I become like them that go down into the pit.
<br>2Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto Thee,
<br>When I lift up my hands toward Thy holy Sanctuary.
<br>
<br>3Draw me not away with the wicked,
<br>And with the workers of iniquity;
<br>Who speak peace with their neighbours,
<br>But evil is in their hearts.
<br>4Give them according to their deeds, and according to the evil of their endeavours;
<br>Give them after the work of their hands;
<br>Render to them their desert.
<br>5Because they give no heed to the works of the LORD,
<br>Nor to the operation of His hands;
<br>He will break them down and not build them up.
<br>
<br>6Blessed be the LORD,
<br>Because He hath heard the voice of my supplications.
<br>7The LORD is my strength and my shield,
<br>In Him hath my heart trusted,
<br> 
<br>And I am helped;
<br>Therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth,
<br>And with my song will I praise Him.
<br>
<br>8The LORD is a strength unto them;
<br>And He is a stronghold of salvation to His anointed.
<br>9Save Thy people, and bless Thine inheritance;
<br>And tend them, and carry them for ever.
<br>29	A Psalm of David.
<br>Ascribe unto the LORD, O ye sons of
<br>might,
<br>Ascribe unto the LORD glory and strength.
<br>2Ascribe unto the LORD the glory due unto His name;
<br>Worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.
<br>
<br>3The voice of the LORD is upon the waters;
<br>The God of glory thundereth, Even the LORD upon many waters.
<br>4The voice of the LORD is powerful;
<br>The voice of the LORD is full of majesty.
<br>5The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars; yea, the LORD breaketh in pieces the cedars of Lebanon.
<br>6He maketh them also to skip like a calf;
<br>Lebanon and Sirion like a young wild-ox.
<br> 
<br>7The voice of the LORD heweth out flames of fire.
<br>8The voice of the LORD shaketh the wilderness;
<br>The LORD shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh.
<br>9The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to calve,
<br>And strippeth the forests bare; And in His temple all say: 'Glory.'
<br>
<br>10The LORD sat enthroned at the flood;
<br>Yea, the LORD sitteth as King for ever.
<br>11The LORD will give strength unto His people;
<br>The LORD will bless his people with peace.
<br>
<br>A Psalm; a Song at the Dedication of the House; of
<br>David.
<br>
<br>2I will extol thee, O LORD, for Thou hast raised me up,
<br>And hast not suffered mine enemies to rejoice over me.
<br>3O LORD my God,
<br>I cried unto Thee, and Thou didst heal me;
<br>4O LORD, Thou broughtest up my soul from the nether-world;
<br>Thou didst kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.
<br>5Sing praise unto the LORD, O ye His godly ones,
<br>And give thanks to His holy name.
<br>6For His anger is but for a moment,
<br> 
<br>His favour is for a life-time; Weeping may tarry for the night, But joy cometh in the morning.
<br>
<br>7Now I had said in my security: ' I shall never be moved.'
<br>8Thou hadst established, O LORD, in Thy favour my mountain as a stronghold—
<br>Thou didst hide Thy face; I was affrighted.
<br>9Unto Thee, O LORD, did I call,
<br>And unto the LORD I made supplication:
<br>10'What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit?
<br>Shall the dust praise Thee? shall it declare Thy truth?
<br>11Hear, O LORD, and be gracious unto me;
<br>LORD, be Thou my helper.'
<br>
<br>12Thou didst turn for me my mourning into dancing;
<br>Thou didst loose my sackcloth, and gird me with gladness;
<br>13So that my glory may sing praise to Thee, and not be silent;
<br>O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto Thee for ever.
<br>
<br>For the Leader. A Psalm of David.
<br>
<br>2In thee, O LORD, have I taken refuge; let me never be ashamed;
<br>Deliver me in Thy righteousness.
<br>3Incline Thine ear unto me, deliver me speedily;
<br> 
<br>Be Thou to me a rock of refuge, even a fortress of defence, to save me.
<br>4For Thou art my rock and my fortress;
<br>Therefore for Thy name's sake lead me and guide me.
<br>5Bring me forth out of the net that they have hidden for me;
<br>For Thou art my stronghold.
<br>6Into Thy hand I commit my spirit; Thou hast redeemed me, O LORD,
<br>Thou God of truth.
<br>7I hate them that regard lying vanities;
<br>But I trust in the LORD.
<br>8I will be glad and rejoice in Thy lovingkindness;
<br>For Thou hast seen mine affliction,
<br>Thou hast taken cognizance of the troubles of my soul,
<br>9And Thou hast not given me over into the hand of the enemy;
<br>Thou hast set my feet in a broad place.
<br>
<br>10Be gracious unto me, O LORD, for I am in distress;
<br>Mine eye wasteth away with vexation, yea, my soul and my body.
<br>11For my life is spent in sorrow, and my years in sighing;
<br>My strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are wasted away.
<br>12Because of all mine adversaries I am become a reproach,
<br> 
<br>Yea, unto my neighbours exceedingly, and a dread to mine acquaintance;
<br>They that see me without flee from me.
<br>13I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind;
<br>I am like a useless vessel.
<br>14For I have heard the whispering of many,
<br>Terror on every side;
<br>While they took counsel together against me,
<br>They devised to take away my life.
<br>
<br>15But as for me, I have trusted in Thee, O LORD;
<br>I have said: 'Thou art my God.'
<br>16My times are in Thy hand;
<br>Deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me.
<br>17Make Thy face to shine upon Thy servant;
<br>Save me in Thy lovingkindness. 18O LORD, let me not be ashamed, for I have called upon Thee;
<br>Let the wicked be ashamed, let them be put to silence in the nether- world.
<br>19Let the lying lips be dumb,
<br>Which speak arrogantly against the righteous,
<br>With pride and contempt.
<br>
<br>20Oh how abundant is Thy goodness, which Thou hast laid up for them that fear Thee;
<br> 
<br>Which Thou hast wrought for them that take their refuge in Thee, in the sight of the sons of men!
<br>21Thou hidest them in the covert of Thy presence from the plottings of man;
<br>Thou concealest them in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.
<br>22Blessed be the LORD;
<br>For He hath shown me His wondrous lovingkindness in an entrenched city.
<br>23As for me, I said in my haste: 'I am cut off from before Thine eyes';
<br>Nevertheless Thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto Thee.
<br>
<br>24O love the LORD, all ye His godly ones;
<br>The LORD preserveth the faithful,
<br>And plentifully repayeth him that acteth haughtily.
<br>25Be strong, and let your heart take courage,
<br>All ye that wait for the LORD.
<br>32 [A Psalm] of David. Maschil. Happy is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is pardoned.
<br>2Happy is the man unto whom the LORD counteth not iniquity,
<br>And in whose spirit there is no guile.
<br>
<br>3When I kept silence, my bones wore away
<br> 
<br>Through my groaning all the day long.
<br>4For day and night Thy hand was heavy upon me;
<br>My sap was turned as in the droughts of summer.	Selah
<br>5I acknowledged my sin unto Thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid;
<br>I said: 'I will make confession concerning my transgressions unto the LORD' —
<br>And Thou, Thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin.	Selah
<br>
<br>6For this let every one that is godly pray unto Thee in a time when Thou mayest be found;
<br>Surely, when the great waters overflow, they will not reach unto him.
<br>7Thou art my hiding-place; Thou wilt preserve me from the adversary;
<br>With songs of deliverance Thou wilt compass me about.	Selah
<br>8'I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go;
<br>I will give counsel, Mine eye being upon thee.'
<br>9Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding;
<br>Whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle,
<br>That they come not near unto thee.
<br>
<br>10Many are the sorrows of the wicked;
<br> 
<br>But he that trusteth in the LORD, mercy compasseth him about.
<br>11Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous;
<br>And shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.
<br>
<br>Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous,
<br>Praise is comely for the upright.
<br>2Give thanks unto the LORD with harp,
<br>Sing praises unto Him with the psaltery of ten strings.
<br>3Sing unto Him a new song;
<br>Play skilfully amid shouts of joy.
<br>
<br>4For the word of the LORD is upright;
<br>And all His work is done in faithfulness.
<br>5He loveth righteousness and justice;
<br>The earth is full of the lovingkindness of the LORD.
<br>6By the word of the LORD were the heavens made;
<br>And all the host of them by the breath of His mouth.
<br>7He gathereth the waters of the sea together as a heap;
<br>He layeth up the deeps in storehouses.
<br>8Let all the earth fear the LORD;
<br>Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of Him.
<br>9For He spoke, and it was; He commanded, and it stood.
<br>10The LORD bringeth the counsel of the nations to nought;
<br> 
<br>He maketh the thoughts of the peoples to be of no effect.
<br>11The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever,
<br>The thoughts of His heart to all generations.
<br>
<br>12Happy is the nation whose God is the LORD;
<br>The people whom He hath chosen for His own inheritance.
<br>13The LORD looketh from heaven; He beholdeth all the sons of men; 14From the place of His habitation
<br>He looketh intently
<br>Upon all the inhabitants of the earth;
<br>15He that fashioneth the hearts of them all,
<br>That considereth all their doings.
<br>16A king is not saved by the multitude of a host;
<br>A mighty man is not delivered by great strength.
<br>17A horse is a vain thing for safety;
<br>Neither doth it afford escape by its great strength.
<br>18Behold, the eye of the LORD is toward them that fear Him,
<br>Toward them that wait for His mercy;
<br>19To deliver their soul from death, And to keep them alive in famine.
<br>
<br>20Our soul hath waited for the LORD; He is our help and our shield.
<br>21For in Him doth our heart rejoice,
<br>Because we have trusted in His holy name.
<br> 
<br>22Let Thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us,
<br>According as we have waited for Thee.
<br>
<br>[A Psalm] of David; when he changed his demeanour before Abimelech, who drove him away, and
<br>he departed.
<br>
<br>א 2I will bless the LORD at all times;
<br>His praise shall continually be in my mouth.
<br>ב 3My soul shall glory in the LORD; The humble shall hear thereof, and be glad.
<br>ג 4O magnify the LORD with me,
<br>And let us exalt His name together. ד 5I sought the LORD, and He answered
<br>me,
<br>And delivered me from all my fears.
<br>ה 6They looked unto Him, and were radiant;
<br>ו And their faces shall never	be abashed.
<br>ז 7This poor man cried, and the LORD heard,
<br>And saved him out of all his troubles.
<br>ח 8The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear Him,
<br>And delivereth them.
<br>ט 9O consider and see that the LORD is good;
<br>Happy is the man that taketh refuge in Him.
<br>י 10O fear the LORD, ye His holy ones;
<br> 
<br>For there is no want to them that fear Him.
<br>כ 11The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger;
<br>But they that seek the LORD want not any good thing.
<br>ל 12Come, ye children, hearken unto me;
<br>I will teach you the fear of	the LORD.
<br>מ 13Who is the man that desireth life, and loveth days,
<br>That he may see good therein? נ 14Keep thy tongue from evil,
<br>And thy lips from speaking guile. ס 15Depart from evil, and do good;
<br>Seek peace, and pursue it.
<br>ע 16The eyes of the LORD are toward the righteous,
<br>And His ears are open unto their cry.
<br>פ 17The face of the LORD is against them that do evil,
<br>To cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.
<br>צ 18 aThey cried, and the LORD heard,
<br>And delivered them out of all their troubles.
<br>ק 19The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart,
<br>And saveth such as are of a contrite spirit.
<br>ר 20Many are the ills of the righteous,
<br>But the LORD delivereth him out of them all.
<br>ש 21He keepeth all his bones; Not one of them is broken.
<br>
<br>a That is, the righteous.
<br> 
<br>ת 22Evil shall kill the wicked;
<br>And they that hate the righteous shall be held guilty.
<br>
<br>23The LORD redeemeth the soul of His servants;
<br>And none of them that take refuge in Him shall be desolate.
<br>35 [A Psalm] of David.
<br>Strive, O LORD, with them that strive
<br>with me;
<br>Fight against them that fight against me.
<br>2Take hold of shield and buckler, And rise up to my help.
<br>3Draw out also the spear, and the battle-axe, against them that pursue me;
<br>Say unto my soul: 'I am Thy salvation.'
<br>4Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion that seek after my soul;
<br>Let them be turned back and be abashed that devise my hurt. 5Let them be as chaff before the
<br>wind,
<br>The angel of the LORD thrusting them.
<br>6Let their way be dark and slippery,
<br>The angel of the LORD pursuing them.
<br>7For without cause have they hid for me the pit, even their net,
<br>Without cause have they digged for my soul.
<br> 
<br>8Let destruction come upon him unawares;
<br>And let his net that he hath hid catch himself;
<br>With destruction let him fall therein.
<br>9And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD;
<br>It shall rejoice in His salvation.
<br>10All my bones shall say: 'LORD, who is like unto Thee,
<br>Who deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him,
<br>Yea, the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him?'
<br>
<br>11Unrighteous witnesses rise up;
<br>They ask me of things that I know not.
<br>12They repay me evil for good; Bereavement is come to my soul. 13But as for me, when they were
<br>sick, my clothing was sackcloth, I afflicted my soul with fasting;
<br>And my prayer, may it return into mine own bosom.
<br>14I went about as though it had been my friend or my brother;
<br>I bowed down mournful, as one that mourneth for his mother.
<br>15But when I halt they rejoice, and gather themselves together;
<br>The abjects gather themselves together against me, and those whom I know not;
<br>They tear me, and cease not;
<br>16With the profanest mockeries of backbiting
<br>They gnash at me with their teeth.
<br> 
<br>17Lord, how long wilt Thou look on?
<br>Rescue my soul from their destructions,
<br>Mine only one from the lions.
<br>18I will give Thee thanks in the great congregation;
<br>I will praise Thee among a numerous people.
<br>19Let not them that are wrongfully mine enemies rejoice over me; Neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.
<br>20For they speak not peace;
<br>But they devise deceitful matters against them that are quiet in the land.
<br>21Yea, they open their mouth wide against me;
<br>They say: 'Aha, aha, our eye hath seen it.'
<br>22Thou hast seen, O LORD; keep not silence;
<br>O Lord, be not far from me.
<br>23Rouse Thee, and awake to my judgment,
<br>Even unto my cause, my God and my Lord.
<br>24Judge me, O LORD my God, according to Thy righteousness;
<br>And let them not rejoice over me.
<br>25Let them not say in their heart: 'Aha, we have our desire';
<br>Let them not say: 'We have swallowed him up.'
<br>26Let them be ashamed and abashed together that rejoice at my hurt;
<br>Let them be clothed with shame and confusion that magnify themselves against me.
<br> 
<br>27Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that delight in my righteousness;
<br>Yea, let them say continually: 'Magnified be the LORD,
<br>Who delighteth in the peace of His servant.'
<br>28And my tongue shall speak of Thy righteousness,
<br>And of Thy praise all the day.
<br>
<br>For the Leader. [A Psalm] of David the servant of the LORD.
<br>
<br>2Transgression speaketh to the wicked, methinks—
<br>There is no fear of God before his eyes.
<br>3For it flattereth him in his eyes,
<br>Until his iniquity be found, and he be hated.
<br>4The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit;
<br>He hath left off to be wise, to do good.
<br>5He deviseth iniquity upon his bed;
<br>He setteth himself in a way that is not good;
<br>He abhorreth not evil.
<br>
<br>6Thy lovingkindness, O LORD, is in the heavens;
<br>Thy faithfulness reacheth unto the skies.
<br>7Thy righteousness is like the mighty mountains;
<br>Thy judgments are like the great deep;
<br> 
<br>Man and beast Thou preservest, O LORD.
<br>8How precious is Thy lovingkindness, O God!
<br>And the children of men take refuge in the shadow of Thy wings.
<br>9They are abundantly satisfied with the fatness of Thy house;
<br>And Thou makest them drink of the river of Thy pleasures.
<br>10For with Thee is the fountain of life;
<br>In Thy light do we see light.
<br>
<br>11O continue Thy lovingkindness unto them that know Thee;
<br>And Thy righteousness to the upright in heart.
<br>12Let not the foot of pride overtake me,
<br>And let not the hand of the wicked drive me away.
<br>13There are the workers of iniquity fallen;
<br>They are thrust down, and are not able to rise.
<br>37 [A Psalm] of David.
<br>א Fret not thyself because of evil-
<br>doers,
<br>Neither be thou envious against them that work unrighteousness.
<br>2For they shall soon wither like the grass,
<br>And fade as the green herb.
<br>
<br>ב 3Trust in the LORD, and do good;
<br> 
<br>Dwell in the land, and cherish faithfulness.
<br>4So shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD;
<br>And He shall give thee the petitions of thy heart.
<br>
<br>ג 5Commit thy way unto the LORD;
<br>Trust also in Him, and He will bring it to pass.
<br>6And He will make thy righteous- ness to go forth as the light,
<br>And thy right as the noonday.
<br>
<br>ד 7Resign thyself unto the LORD, and wait patiently for Him;
<br>Fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way,
<br>Because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.
<br>
<br>ה 8Cease from anger, and forsake wrath;
<br>Fret not thyself, it tendeth only to evil-doing.
<br>9For evil-doers shall be cut off; But those that wait for the LORD, they shall inherit the land.
<br>
<br>ו 10And yet a little while, and the wicked is no more;
<br>Yea, thou shalt look well at his place, and he is not.
<br>11But the humble shall inherit the land,
<br>And delight themselves in the abundance of peace.
<br> 
<br>ז 12The wicked plotteth against the righteous,
<br>And gnasheth at him with his teeth.
<br>13The Lord doth laugh at him;
<br>For He seeth that his day is coming.
<br>
<br>ח 14The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow;
<br>To cast down the poor and needy,
<br>To slay such as are upright in the way;
<br>15Their sword shall enter into their own heart,
<br>And their bows shall be broken.
<br>
<br>ט 16Better is a little that the righteous hath
<br>Than the abundance of many wicked.
<br>17For the arms of the wicked shall be broken;
<br>But the LORD upholdeth the righteous.
<br>
<br>י 18The LORD knoweth the days of them that are wholehearted;
<br>And their inheritance shall be for ever.
<br>19They shall not be ashamed in the time of evil;
<br>And in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.
<br>
<br>כ 20For the wicked shall perish,
<br>And the enemies of the LORD	shall be as the fat of lambs—
<br>They shall pass away in smoke, they shall pass away.
<br> 
<br>ל 21The wicked borroweth, and payeth not;
<br>But the righteous dealeth graciously, and giveth.
<br>22For such as are blessed of Him shall inherit the land;
<br>And they that are cursed of Him shall be cut off.
<br>
<br>מ 23It is of the LORD that a man's goings are established;
<br>And He delighted in his way.
<br>24Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down;
<br>For the LORD upholdeth his	hand.
<br>
<br>נ 25I have been young, and now am old;
<br>Yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken,
<br>Nor his seed begging bread. 26All the day long he dealeth graciously, and lendeth;
<br>And his seed is blessed.
<br>
<br>ס 27Depart from evil, and do good; And dwell for evermore.
<br>28For the LORD loveth justice, And forsaketh not His saints; They are preserved for ever;
<br>But the seed of the wicked shall	be cut off.
<br>29The righteous shall inherit the land,
<br>And dwell therein for ever.
<br>
<br>פ 30The mouth of the righteous uttereth wisdom,
<br>And his tongue speaketh justice.
<br> 
<br>31The law of his God is in his heart; None of his steps slide.
<br>
<br>צ 32The wicked watcheth the righteous,
<br>And seeketh to slay him.
<br>33The LORD will not leave him in his hand,
<br>Nor suffer him to be condemned when he is judged.
<br>
<br>ק 34Wait for the LORD, and keep His way,
<br>And He will exalt thee to inherit the land;
<br>When the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.
<br>
<br>ר 35I have seen the wicked in great power,
<br>And spreading himself like a leafy tree in its native soil.
<br>36But one passed by, and, lo, he was not;
<br>Yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.
<br>
<br>ש 37Mark the man of integrity, and behold the upright;
<br>For there is a future for the man	of peace.
<br>38But transgressors shall be destroyed together;
<br>The future of the wicked shall be cut off.
<br>
<br>ת 39But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD;
<br> 
<br>He is their stronghold in the time of trouble.
<br>40And the LORD helpeth them,	and delivereth them;
<br>He delivereth them from the wicked, and saveth them,
<br>Because they have taken refuge in Him.
<br>
<br>A Psalm of David, to make memorial.
<br>
<br>2O LORD, rebuke me not in Thine anger;
<br>Neither chasten me in Thy wrath.
<br>3For Thine arrows are gone deep into me,
<br>And Thy hand is come down upon me.
<br>4There is no soundness in my flesh because of Thine indignation;
<br>Neither is there any health in my bones because of my sin.
<br>5For mine iniquities are gone over my head;
<br>As a heavy burden they are too heavy for me.
<br>6My wounds are noisome, they fester,
<br>Because of my foolishness.
<br>7I am bent and bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day.
<br>8For my loins are filled with burning;
<br>And there is no soundness in my flesh.
<br>9I am benumbed and sore crushed;
<br>I groan by reason of the moaning of my heart.
<br> 
<br>
<br>10Lord, all my desire is before Thee; And my sighing is not hid from
<br>Thee.
<br>11My heart fluttereth, my strength faileth me;
<br>As for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.
<br>12My friends and my companions stand aloof from my plague;
<br>And my kinsmen stand afar off.
<br>13They also that seek after my life lay snares for me;
<br>And they that seek my hurt speak crafty devices,
<br>And utter deceits all the day.
<br>14But I am as a deaf man, I hear not;
<br>And I am as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth.
<br>15Yea, I am become as a man that heareth not,
<br>And in whose mouth are no arguments.
<br>
<br>16For in Thee, O LORD, do I hope; Thou wilt answer, O Lord my God. 17For I said: 'Lest they rejoice over
<br>me;
<br>When my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.'
<br>18For I am ready to halt,
<br>And my pain is continually before me.
<br>19For I do declare mine iniquity;
<br>I am full of care because of my sin.
<br>20But mine enemies are strong in health;
<br>And they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.
<br> 
<br>21They also that repay evil for good Are adversaries unto me, because I
<br>follow the thing that is good.
<br>22Forsake me not, O LORD;
<br>O my God, be not far from me.
<br>23Make haste to help me, O Lord, my salvation.
<br>
<br>For the Leader, for Jeduthun. A Psalm of David.
<br>
<br>2I said: 'I will take heed to my ways, That I sin not with my tongue;
<br>I will keep a curb upon my mouth, While the wicked is before me.'
<br>3I was dumb with silence; I held my peace, had no comfort;
<br>And my pain was held in check.
<br>4My heart waxed hot within me;
<br>While I was musing, the fire kindled;
<br>Then spoke I with my tongue:
<br>
<br>5'LORD, make me to know mine end,
<br>And the measure of my days, what it is;
<br>Let me know how short-lived I am.
<br>6Behold, Thou hast made my days as hand-breadths;
<br>And mine age is as nothing before Thee;
<br>Surely every man at his best estate is altogether vanity.	Selah
<br>7Surely man walketh as a mere semblance;
<br>Surely for vanity they are in turmoil;
<br>He heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them.
<br> 
<br>8And now, Lord, what wait I for? My hope, it is in Thee.
<br>9Deliver me from all my transgressions;
<br>Make me not the reproach of the base.
<br>10I am dumb, I open not my mouth; Because Thou hast done it.
<br>11Remove Thy stroke from off me;
<br>I am consumed by the blow of Thy hand.
<br>12With rebukes dost Thou chasten man for iniquity,
<br>And like a moth Thou makest his beauty to consume away;
<br>Surely every man is vanity.	Selah
<br>
<br>13Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry;
<br>Keep not silence at my tears; For I am a stranger with Thee,
<br>A sojourner, as all my fathers were.
<br>14Look away from me, that I may take comfort,
<br>Before I go hence, and be no more.'
<br>
<br>For the Leader. A Psalm of David.
<br>
<br>2I waited patiently for the LORD;
<br>And He inclined unto me, and heard my cry.
<br>3He brought me up also out of the tumultuous pit, out of the miry clay;
<br>And He set my feet upon a rock, He established my goings.
<br>4And He hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God;
<br> 
<br>Many shall see, and fear, And shall trust in the LORD.
<br>
<br>5Happy is the man that hath made the LORD his trust,
<br>And hath not turned unto the arrogant, nor unto such as fall away treacherously.
<br>6Many things hast Thou done, O LORD my God,
<br>Even Thy wonderful works, and Thy thoughts toward us;
<br>There is none to be compared unto Thee!
<br>If I would declare and speak of them,
<br>They are more than can be told.
<br>7Sacrifice and meal-offering Thou hast no delight in;
<br>Mine ears hast Thou opened;
<br>Burnt-offering and sin-offering hast Thou not required.
<br>8Then said I: 'Lo, I am come With the roll of a book which is
<br>prescribed for me;
<br>9I delight to do Thy will, O my God; Yea, Thy law is in my inmost parts.' 10I have preached righteousness in
<br>the great congregation, Lo, I did not refrain my lips; O LORD, Thou knowest.
<br>11I have not hid Thy righteousness within my heart;
<br>I have declared Thy faithfulness and Thy salvation;
<br>I have not concealed Thy mercy and Thy truth from the great congregation.
<br> 
<br>12Thou, O LORD, wilt not withhold Thy compassions from me;
<br>Let Thy mercy and Thy truth continually preserve me.
<br>
<br>13For innumerable evils have compassed me about,
<br>Mine iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up; They are more than the hairs of my head, and my heart hath failed
<br>me.
<br>14Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me; O LORD, make haste to help me.
<br>15Let them be ashamed and abashed together
<br>That seek after my soul to sweep it away;
<br>Let them be turned backward and brought to confusion
<br>That delight in my hurt.
<br>16Let them be appalled by reason of their shame
<br>That say unto me: 'Aha, aha.'
<br>17Let all those that seek Thee rejoice and be glad in Thee;
<br>Let such as love Thy salvation say continually:
<br>'The LORD be magnified.'
<br>18But, as for me, that am poor and needy,
<br>The Lord will account it unto me; Thou art my help and my deliverer; O my God, tarry not.
<br>
<br>For the Leader. A Psalm of David.
<br> 
<br>2Happy is he that considereth the poor;
<br>The LORD will deliver him in the day of evil.
<br>3The LORD preserve him, and keep him alive, let him be called happy in the land;
<br>And deliver not Thou him unto the greed of his enemies.
<br>4The LORD support him upon the bed of illness;
<br>Mayest Thou turn all his lying down in his sickness.
<br>
<br>5As for me, I said: 'O LORD, be gracious unto me;
<br>Heal my soul; for I have sinned against Thee.'
<br>6Mine enemies speak evil of me: 'When shall he die, and his name
<br>perish?'
<br>7And if one come to see me, he speaketh falsehood;
<br>His heart gathereth iniquity to itself;
<br>When he goeth abroad, he speaketh of it.
<br>8All that hate me whisper together against me,
<br>Against me do they devise my hurt:
<br>9'An evil thing cleaveth fast unto him;
<br>And now that he lieth, he shall rise up no more.'
<br>10Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, who did eat of my bread,
<br>Hath lifted up his heel against me.
<br> 
<br>11But Thou, O LORD, be gracious unto me, and raise me up,
<br>That I may requite them.
<br>12By this I know that Thou delightest in me,
<br>That mine enemy doth not triumph over me.
<br>13And as for me, Thou upholdest me because of mine integrity,
<br>And settest me before Thy face for ever.
<br>14Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel,
<br>From everlasting and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen.

<br>BOOK II
<br>For the Leader; Maschil of the sons of Korah.
<br>
<br>2As the hart panteth after the water brooks,
<br>So panteth my soul after Thee, O God.
<br>3My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God:
<br>'When shall I come and appear before God?'
<br>4My tears have been my food day and night,
<br>While they say unto me all the day: 'Where is Thy God?'
<br>5These things I remember, and pour out my soul within me,
<br> 
<br>How I passed on with the throng, and led them to the house of God,
<br>With the voice of joy and praise, a multitude keeping holyday.
<br>6Why art thou cast down, O my soul?
<br>And why moanest thou within me? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet praise Him
<br>For the salvation of His countenance.
<br>
<br>7O my God, my soul is cast down within me;
<br>Therefore do I remember Thee from the land of Jordan,
<br>And the Hermons, from the hill Mizar.
<br>8Deep calleth unto deep at the voice of Thy cataracts;
<br>All Thy waves and Thy billows are gone over me.
<br>9By day the LORD will command His lovingkindness,
<br>And in the night His song shall be with me,
<br>Even a prayer unto the God of my life.
<br>10I will say unto God my Rock: 'Why hast Thou forgotten me?
<br>Why go I mourning under the oppression of the enemy?'
<br>11As with a crushing in my bones, mine adversaries taunt me;
<br>While they say unto me all the day: 'Where is Thy God?'
<br>12Why art thou cast down, O my soul?
<br>And why moanest thou within me?
<br> 
<br>Hope thou in God; for I shall yet praise Him,
<br>The salvation of my countenance, and my God.
<br>
<br>Be Thou my judge, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation;
<br>O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.
<br>2For Thou art the God of my strength; why hast Thou cast me off?
<br>Why go I mourning under the oppression of the enemy?
<br>3O send out Thy light and Thy truth; let them lead me;
<br>Let them bring me unto Thy holy mountain, and to Thy dwelling- places.
<br>4Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God, my exceeding joy;
<br>And praise Thee upon the harp, O God, my God.
<br>5Why art thou cast down, O my soul?
<br>And why moanest thou within me?
<br>Hope thou in God; for I shall yet praise Him,
<br>The salvation of my countenance, and my God.
<br>
<br>For the Leader; [a Psalm] of the sons of Korah. Maschil.
<br>
<br>2O God, we have heard with our ears, our fathers have told us;
<br> 
<br>A work Thou didst in their days, in the days of old.
<br>3Thou with Thy hand didst drive out the nations, and didst plant them in;
<br>Thou didst break the peoples, and didst spread them abroad.
<br>4For not by their own sword did they get the land in possession,
<br>Neither did their own arm save them;
<br>But Thy right hand, and Thine arm, and the light of Thy countenance,
<br>Because Thou wast favourable unto them.
<br>
<br>5Thou art my King, O God; Command the salvation of Jacob. 6Through Thee do we push down
<br>our adversaries;
<br>Through Thy name do we tread them under that rise up against us.
<br>7For I trust not in my bow, Neither can my sword save me. 8But Thou hast saved us from our
<br>adversaries,
<br>And hast put them to shame that hate us.
<br>9In God have we gloried all the day,
<br>And we will give thanks unto Thy name for ever.	Selah
<br>
<br>10Yet Thou hast cast off, and brought us to confusion;
<br>And goest not forth with our hosts.
<br>11Thou makest us to turn back from the adversary;
<br>And they that hate us spoil at their will.
<br> 
<br>12Thou hast given us like sheep to be eaten;
<br>And hast scattered us among the nations.
<br>13Thou sellest Thy people for small gain,
<br>And hast not set their prices high.
<br>14Thou makest us a taunt to our neighbours,
<br>A scorn and a derision to them that are round about us.
<br>15Thou makest us a byword among the nations,
<br>A shaking of the head among the peoples.
<br>16All the day is my confusion before me,
<br>And the shame of my face hath covered me,
<br>17For the voice of him that taunteth and blasphemeth;
<br>By reason of the enemy and the revengeful.
<br>
<br>18All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten Thee,
<br>Neither have we been false to Thy covenant.
<br>19Our heart is not turned back,
<br>Neither have our steps declined from Thy path;
<br>20Though Thou hast crushed us into a place of jackals,
<br>And covered us with the shadow of death.
<br>21If we had forgotten the name of our God,
<br>Or spread forth our hands to a strange god;
<br> 
<br>22Would not God search this out?
<br>For He knoweth the secrets of the heart.
<br>23Nay, but for Thy sake are we killed all the day;
<br>We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.
<br>
<br>24Awake, why sleepest Thou, O Lord?
<br>Arouse Thyself, cast not off for ever.
<br>25Wherefore hidest Thou Thy face,
<br>And forgettest our affliction and our oppression?
<br>26For our soul is bowed down to the dust;
<br>Our belly cleaveth unto the earth.
<br>27Arise for our help,
<br>And redeem us for Thy mercy's sake.
<br>
<br>For	the	Leader;	upon Shoshannim; [a Psalm] of the
<br>sons of Korah. Maschil. A Song of loves.
<br>
<br>2My heart overfloweth with a goodly matter;
<br>I say: 'My work is concerning a king';
<br>My tongue is the pen of a ready writer.
<br>
<br>3Thou art fairer than the children of men;
<br>Grace is poured upon thy lips;
<br>Therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.
<br> 
<br>4Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O mighty one,
<br>Thy glory and thy majesty.
<br>5And in thy majesty prosper, ride on,
<br>In behalf of truth and meekness and righteousness;
<br>And let thy right hand teach thee tremendous things.
<br>6Thine arrows are sharp— The peoples fall under thee—
<br>[They sink] into the heart of the king's enemies.
<br>7Thy throne given of God is for ever and ever;
<br>A sceptre of equity is the sceptre of thy kingdom.
<br>8Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated wickedness;
<br>Therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee
<br>With the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
<br>9Myrrh, and aloes, and cassia are all thy garments;
<br>Out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have made thee glad.
<br>10Kings' daughters are among thy favourites;
<br>At thy right hand doth stand the queen in gold of Ophir.
<br>11'Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear;
<br>Forget also thine own people, and thy father's house;
<br>12So shall the king desire thy beauty;
<br>For he is thy lord; and do homage unto him.
<br> 
<br>13And, O daughter of Tyre, the richest of the people
<br>Shall entreat thy favour with a gift.'
<br>14All glorious is the king's daughter within the palace;
<br>Her raiment is of chequer work inwrought with gold.
<br>15She shall be led unto the king on richly woven stuff;
<br>The virgins her companions in her train being brought unto thee.
<br>16They shall be led with gladness and rejoicing;
<br>They shall enter into the king's palace.
<br>17Instead of thy fathers shall be thy sons,
<br>Whom thou shalt make princes in all the land.
<br>18I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations;
<br>Therefore shall the peoples praise thee for ever and ever.
<br>
<br>For the Leader; [a Psalm] of the	sons	of	Korah;	upon
<br>Alamoth. A Song.
<br>
<br>2God is our refuge and strength, A very present help in trouble.
<br>3Therefore will we not fear, though the earth do change,
<br>And though the mountains be moved into the heart of the seas;
<br>4Though the waters thereof roar and foam,
<br>Though the mountains shake at the swelling thereof.	Selah
<br> 
<br>5There is a river, the streams whereof make glad the city of God,
<br>The holiest dwelling-place of the Most High.
<br>6God is in the midst of her, she shall not be moved;
<br>God shall help her, at the approach of morning.
<br>7Nations were in tumult, kingdoms were moved;
<br>He uttered His voice, the earth melted.
<br>8The LORD of hosts is with us;
<br>The God of Jacob is our high tower.
<br>Selah
<br>
<br>9Come, behold the works of the LORD,
<br>Who hath made desolations in the earth.
<br>10He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth;
<br>He breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder;
<br>He burneth the chariots in the fire. 11'Let be, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations,
<br>I will be exalted in the earth.'
<br>12The LORD of hosts is with us;
<br>The God of Jacob is our high tower.
<br>Selah
<br>
<br>For the Leader; a Psalm of the sons of Korah.
<br>
<br>2O clap your hands, all ye peoples;
<br>Shout unto God with the voice of triumph.
<br> 
<br>3For the LORD is most high, awful; A great King over all the earth.
<br>4He subdueth peoples under us, And nations under our feet.
<br>5He chooseth our inheritance for us, The pride of Jacob whom He loveth.
<br>Selah
<br>
<br>6God is gone up amidst shouting,
<br>The LORD amidst the sound of the horn.
<br>7Sing praises to God, sing praises;
<br>Sing praises unto our King, sing praises.
<br>
<br>8For God is the King of all the earth; Sing ye praises in a skilful song.
<br>9God reigneth over the nations; God sitteth upon His holy throne.
<br>
<br>10The princes of the peoples are gathered together,
<br>The people of the God of Abraham;
<br>For unto God belong the shields of the earth;
<br>He is greatly exalted.
<br>
<br>A Song; a Psalm of the sons of Korah.
<br>
<br>2Great is the LORD, and highly to be praised,
<br>In the city of our God, His holy mountain,
<br>3Fair in situation, the joy of the whole earth;
<br>Even mount Zion, the uttermost parts of the north,
<br>The city of the great King.
<br> 
<br>4God in her palaces
<br>Hath made Himself known for a stronghold.
<br>
<br>5For, lo, the kings assembled themselves,
<br>They came onward together.
<br>6They saw, straightway they were amazed;
<br>They were affrighted, they hasted away.
<br>7Trembling took hold of them there, Pangs, as of a woman in travail.
<br>8With the east wind
<br>Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish. 9As we have heard, so have we seen In the city of the LORD of hosts, in
<br>the city of our God—
<br>God establish it for ever.        Selah
<br>
<br>10We have thought on Thy lovingkindness, O God,
<br>In the midst of Thy temple.
<br>11As is Thy name, O God,
<br>So is Thy praise unto the ends of the earth;
<br>Thy right hand is full of righteousness.
<br>12Let mount Zion be glad,
<br>Let the daughters of Judah rejoice, Because of Thy judgments.
<br>13Walk about Zion, and go round about her;
<br>Count the towers thereof. 14Mark ye well her ramparts, Traverse her palaces;
<br>That ye may tell it to the generation following.
<br> 
<br>15For such is God, our God, for ever and ever;
<br>He will guide us eternally.
<br>
<br>For the Leader; a Psalm of the sons of Korah.
<br>
<br>2Hear this, all ye peoples;
<br>Give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world,
<br>3Both low and high, Rich and poor together.
<br>4My mouth shall speak wisdom,
<br>And the meditation of my heart shall be understanding.
<br>5I will incline mine ear to a parable;
<br>I will open my dark saying upon the harp.
<br>
<br>6Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil,
<br>When the iniquity of my supplanters compasseth me about,
<br>7Of them that trust in their wealth,
<br>And boast themselves in the multitude of their riches?
<br>8No man can by any means redeem his brother,
<br>Nor give to God a ransom for him—
<br>9For too costly is the redemption of their soul,
<br>And must be let alone for ever— 10That he should still live alway, That he should not see the pit.
<br>11For he seeth that wise men die,
<br>The fool and the brutish together perish,
<br>And leave their wealth to others.
<br> 
<br>12Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever,
<br>And their dwelling-places to all generations;
<br>They call their lands after their own names.
<br>13But man abideth not in honour; He is like the beasts that perish.
<br>
<br>14This is the way of them that are foolish,
<br>And of those who after them approve their sayings.	Selah
<br>15Like sheep they are appointed for the nether-world;
<br>Death shall be their shepherd;
<br>And the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning;
<br>And their form shall be for the nether-world to wear away,
<br>That there be no habitation for it.
<br>16But God will redeem my soul from the power of the nether-world;
<br>For He shall receive me.	Selah
<br>17Be not thou afraid when one waxeth rich,
<br>When the wealth of his house is increased;
<br>18For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away;
<br>His wealth shall not descend after him.
<br>19Though while he lived he blessed his soul:
<br>'Men will praise thee, when thou shalt do well to thyself';
<br>20It shall go to the generation of his fathers;
<br>They shall never see the light.
<br> 
<br>21Man that is in honour understandeth not;
<br>He is like the beasts that perish.
<br>50 A Psalm of Asaph.
<br>God, God, the LORD, hath spoken,
<br>and called the earth
<br>From the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.
<br>
<br>2Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty,
<br>God hath shined forth.
<br>3Our God cometh, and doth not keep silence;
<br>A fire devoureth before Him,
<br>And round about Him it stormeth mightily.
<br>4He calleth to the heavens above, And to the earth, that He may judge
<br>His people:
<br>5'Gather My saints together unto Me;
