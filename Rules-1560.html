<br>
<br>In subsection (a), before clause (1), the words "Except as provided by another law" are substituted for "than as specially allowed by law" in 31:521 for clarity and consistency. The words "an official or agent of the United States Government having custody or possession of public money" are substituted for "The Treasurer of the United States, all assistant treasurers [subsequently changed to 'all depositaries designated in accordance with section 476 of this title' because of 31:476], and those performing the duties of assistant treasurer, all collectors of the customs, all surveyors of the customs, acting also as collectors, all receivers of public moneys at the several land offices, all postmasters, and all public officers of whatsoever character . . . all the public money collected by them, or otherwise at any time placed in their possession and custody" to eliminate unnecessary words and for consistency in the revised title. The words "till the same is ordered, by the proper department or officer of the Government, to be transferred or paid out" are omitted as superseded by source provisions restated in the chapter. The text of 31:521(words after semicolon) is omitted as unnecessary because of the restatement.
<br>
<br>In subsection (b), the words "any abatement or" are omitted as surplus. The words "for any charge or claim" are substituted for "on account of salary, fees, costs, charges, expenses, or claim of any description whatever", and the words "shall deposit the money in the Treasury" are substituted for "The gross amount of all moneys received from whatever source for the use of the United States, . . . shall be paid . . . into the Treasury", to eliminate unnecessary words. The words "except as otherwise provided in section 487 of this title" are omitted because 31:487 is obsolete. The text of 31:484(last sentence) is omitted as superseded by title 39.
<br>
<br>In subsection (c), the word "Secretary" is substituted for "Treasurer" because of the source provisions restated in section 321(c) of the revised title. The balance of subsection (c) is substituted for 31:495(words before proviso) for clarity and consistency. The text of 31:495(proviso) is omitted as superseded by title 39.
<br>
<br>Subsection (d) is substituted for 31:490 for clarity and consistency.
<br>
<br>In subsection (e), the words "official or agent having custody or possession of public money" are substituted for "persons charged by law with the safekeeping, transfer, and disbursements of the public moneys" for consistency and to eliminate unnecessary words. The words "other than those connected with the United States Postal Service" are omitted as superseded by title 39.
<br>
<br>In subsection (f), the word "expressly" is omitted as surplus. The words "official or agent having custody or possession" are substituted for 31:545(words before 21st comma) for consistency and to eliminate unnecessary words. The words "additional . . . fireproof of chests or vaults or other necessary expenses of" are omitted as surplus. The words "employ or pay officers and employees of the Government" are substituted for "clerical services or payment of employees of any nature or grade" for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.

<br>
<br>The reference to "952(g)(2)" in 31 App.:484 is incorrect and should be "952(f)(2)".
<br>1984 Act (Pub. L. 98–216)
<br>
<br>Section 3618 (1st sentence related to non-military deposits) of the Revised Statutes inadvertently was omitted as a source credit for 31:3302. Table 2A of H. Rep. 97–651 (p. 298) states that the sentence was omitted as superseded by various sections of title 10. Title 10 supersedes the sentence only as it applies to military deposits. However, the language of section 3618 (1st sentence related to non-military deposits) is subsumed in the broader language of section 3617 of the Revised Statutes, the source credit for 31:3302(b). Therefore, while section 3618 (1st sentence related to non-military deposits) should be a source credit for 31:3302(b), it is not necessary that the language of the sentence be restated.

<br>
<br>The section uses the defined term "executive agency" in section 102 of the revised title because the source provisions of this section are from a reorganization plan and executive orders that apply only to departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the executive branch of the United States Government.
<br>
<br>In subsections (a) and (b), the words "Secretary of the Treasury" and "Secretary" are substituted for references to the Division of Disbursement and a Chief Disbursing Officer because of the source provisions restated in section 321(c) of the revised title. The words "public money" are substituted for "moneys of the United States" for consistency with the other source provisions restated in the section and for consistency in the chapter.
<br>
<br>Subsection (a) is substituted for section 4(1st paragraph) of Executive Order No. 6166 to omit executed words.
<br>
<br>In subsection (b), the words "may require" and "as the interests of" are omitted as unnecessary. The words "to establish local offices" are omitted because of the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury as the head of the Department of the Treasury and the authority of the Secretary under section 321 of the revised title. The text of section 4(last paragraph) is omitted as superseded by section 3325 of the revised title.
<br>
<br>In subsection (c), the text of 31:492–1(1st sentence) is applied only to the listed agencies because of subsection (a) and Executive Order 6728. The text of 31:492–1(last sentence) is omitted as superseded by section 2 of Reorganization Plan No. 18 of 1950 (eff. July 1, 1950, 64 Stat. 1270) and by 40:490. In clause (1), the words after "disbursement by United States marshals" and before the last proviso in section 3 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1940 (eff. June 30, 1940, 54 Stat. 1234) are omitted as unnecessary because of 28:571 and sections 3512(a)–(c) and 3513(a) of the revised title. In clause (2), the word "pay" is substituted for "salaries" in Executive Order No. 6728 for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The words "including the Marine Corps" are omitted as being included in "military departments". The words "Panama Canal" are omitted because of the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977. The first proviso is omitted as unnecessary because of sections 3512 and 3513 of the revised title. Section 4 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1940 is omitted because (1) the Post Office Department was abolished by the 1970 restatement of title 39, with all authority of the former Postmaster General being placed in the new United States Postal Service, (2) under 39:410 and 3604, the Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission were exempt from all provisions of law related to budget and funds, and (3) the Postal Savings System and its Board of Trustees were abolished under section 5 of the Act of March 28, 1942 (ch. 205, 56 Stat. 189).

<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13681. Improving the Security of Consumer Financial Transactions
<br>
<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13681, Oct. 17, 2014, 79 F.R. 63491, provided:
<br>
<br>Given that identity crimes, including credit, debit, and other payment card fraud, continue to be a risk to U.S. economic activity, and given the economic consequences of data breaches, the United States must take further action to enhance the security of data in the financial marketplace. While the U.S. Government's credit, debit, and other payment card programs already include protections against fraud, the Government must further strengthen the security of consumer data and encourage the adoption of enhanced safeguards nationwide in a manner that protects privacy and confidentiality while maintaining an efficient and innovative financial system.
<br>
<br>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to improve the security of consumer financial transactions in both the private and public sectors, it is hereby ordered as follows:
<br>
<br>Section 1. Secure Government Payments. In order to strengthen data security and thereby better protect citizens doing business with the Government, executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall, as soon as possible, transition payment processing terminals and credit, debit, and other payment cards to employ enhanced security features, including chip-and-PIN technology. In determining enhanced security features to employ, agencies shall consider relevant voluntary consensus standards and specifications, as appropriate, consistent with the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 and Office of Management and Budget Circular A–119.
<br>
<br>(a) The Secretary of the Treasury shall take necessary steps to ensure that payment processing terminals acquired by agencies through the Department of the Treasury or through alternative means authorized by the Department of the Treasury have enhanced security features. No later than January 1, 2015, all new payment processing terminals acquired in these ways shall include hardware necessary to support such enhanced security features. By January 1, 2015, the Department of the Treasury shall develop a plan for agencies to install enabling software that supports enhanced security features.
<br>
<br>(b) The Administrator of General Services shall take necessary steps to ensure that credit, debit, and other payment cards provided through General Services Administration (GSA) contracts have enhanced security features, and shall begin replacing credit, debit, and other payment cards without enhanced security features no later than January 1, 2015.
<br>
<br>(c) The Secretary of the Treasury shall take necessary steps to ensure that Direct Express prepaid debit cards for administering Government benefits have enhanced security features, and by January 1, 2015, the Department of the Treasury shall develop a plan for the replacement of Direct Express prepaid debit cards without enhanced security features.
<br>
<br>(d) By January 1, 2015, other agencies with credit, debit, and other payment card programs shall provide to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) plans for ensuring that their credit, debit, and other payment cards have enhanced security features.
<br>
<br>(e) Nothing in this order shall be construed to preclude agencies from adopting additional standards or upgrading to more effective technology and standards to improve the security of consumer financial transactions as technologies and threats evolve.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. Improved Identity Theft Remediation. To reduce the burden on consumers who have been victims of identity theft, including by substantially reducing the amount of time necessary for a consumer to remediate typical incidents:
<br>
<br>(a) by February 15, 2015, the Attorney General, in coordination with the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall issue guidance to promote regular submissions, as appropriate and permitted by law, by Federal law enforcement agencies of compromised credentials to the National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance's Internet Fraud Alert System;
<br>
<br>(b) the Department of Justice, the Department of Commerce, and the Social Security Administration shall identify all publicly available agency resources for victims of identity theft, and shall provide to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) information about such resources no later than March 15, 2015, with updates thereafter as necessary. These agencies shall work in consultation with the FTC to streamline these resources and consolidate them wherever possible at the FTC's public Web site, IdentityTheft.gov; and
<br>
<br>(c) OMB and GSA shall assist the FTC in enhancing the functionality of IdentityTheft.gov, including by coordinating with the credit bureaus to streamline the reporting and remediation process with credit bureaus' systems to the extent feasible, and in making the enhanced site available to the public by May 15, 2015.
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. Securing Federal Transactions Online. To help ensure that sensitive data are shared only with the appropriate person or people, within 90 days of the date of this order, the National Security Council staff, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and OMB shall present to the President a plan, consistent with the guidance set forth in the 2011 National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace, to ensure that all agencies making personal data accessible to citizens through digital applications require the use of multiple factors of authentication and an effective identity proofing process, as appropriate. Within 18 months of the date of this order, relevant agencies shall complete any required implementation steps set forth in the plan prepared pursuant to this section.
<br>
<br>Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
<br>
<br>(b) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
<br>
<br>(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or
<br>
<br>(ii) the functions of the Director of OMB relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
<br>
<br>(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

<br>§3322. Disbursing officials
<br>
<br>(a) The Secretary of the Treasury shall transfer public money to a disbursing official only by draft or warrant written on the Treasury. Except as provided in section 3716 and section 3720A of this title and subsection (b) of this section, a disbursing official shall—
<br>
<br>(1) deposit public money as required by section 3302 of this title; and
<br>
<br>(2) draw public money from the Treasury or a depositary only—
<br>
<br>(A) as necessary to make payments; and
<br>
<br>(B) payable to persons to whom payment is to be made.
<br>
<br>(b) In a place without a depositary, the Secretary, on deciding it is essential to the public interest, may authorize specially in writing that public money be—
<br>
<br>(1) deposited in any other public depositary; or
<br>
<br>(2) kept in another manner under regulations the Secretary decides are the safest and most effective in making a payment to a public creditor easier.
<br>
<br>(c) A disbursing official is not liable for an overpayment provided under a United States Government bill of lading or transportation request when the overpayment is caused by the—
<br>
<br>(1) use of improper transportation rates or classifications if the Administrator of General Services has determined that verification by a prepayment audit conducted pursuant to section 3726(a) of this title for a particular mode or modes of transportation, or for an agency or subagency, will not adequately protect the interests of the Government; or
<br>
<br>(2) failure to deduct the proper amount under—
<br>
<br>(A) a land grant law; or
<br>
<br>(B) an equalization or other agreement.

<br>
<br>In the section, the words "disbursing official" are substituted for "disbursing officer" for consistency in the revised title.
<br>
<br>In subsection (a), before clause (1), the words "Secretary of the Treasury" are substituted for "Treasurer of the United States" because of the source provisions restated in section 321(c) of the revised title. The words "or an assistant treasurer of the United States" in section 3620(a) of the Revised Statutes are omitted as obsolete because of the 1st–4th pars. under the heading "Independent Treasury" in the Act of May 29, 1920 (ch. 214, 41 Stat. 654). In clause (1), the words "as required by section 3302 of this title" are substituted for "with the Treasurer or some one of the assistant treasurers of the United States (subsequently changed to 'or with one of the depositaries of the United States mentioned in section 476 of this title')" because of 31:476. In clause (2), the words "in pursuance of law" are omitted as surplus. The text of 31:492(a)(last sentence) is omitted because of section 3323(a) of the revised title.
<br>
<br>In subsection (b), before clause (1), the words "On and after June 1, 1942" are omitted as executed. The words "of the United States" are omitted as unnecessary. The words "for transportation" are omitted as surplus.
<br>1984 Act
<br>
<br>This is necessary because section 3620(a) (last sentence) of the Revised Statutes inadvertently was omitted from the codification of title 31 by section 1 of the Act of September 13, 1982 (Pub. L. 97–258, 96 Stat. 877).
<br>
<br>In subsection (a), before clause (1), the words "Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section" are added because of the restatement.
<br>
<br>In subsection (b), before clause (1), the word "however" is omitted as surplus. The words "treasurer or" are omitted as obsolete because of the 1st–4th pars. under the heading "Independent Treasury" in the Act of May 29, 1920 (ch. 214, 41 Stat. 654). In clause (2), the words "rules and" are omitted as surplus.

<br>§3331. Substitute checks
<br>
<br>(a) In this section, "original check"—
<br>
<br>(1) means an order for the payment of money—
<br>
<br>(A) payable on demand;
<br>
<br>(B) that does not bear interest;
<br>
<br>(C) drawn by an authorized disbursing official or agent of the United States Government; and
<br>
<br>(D) the amount of which is deposited with the Treasury or another account available for payment; and
<br>
<br>(2) does not include coins and currency of the Government.
<br>
<br>(b) When the Secretary of the Treasury is satisfied that an original check is lost, stolen, destroyed in any part, or is so defaced that the value to the owner or holder is impaired, the Secretary may issue a substitute check to the owner or holder of the original check. Except as provided in subsection (c) or (f) of this section, the substitute check is payable from the amount available to pay the original check.
<br>
<br>(c) When the Secretary is satisfied that an original check drawn on a depositary in a foreign country or a territory or possession of the United States is lost, stolen, destroyed in part, or is so defaced that its value to the owner or holder is impaired, the drawer of the original check (or another official designated by the Secretary with the approval of the head of the agency on whose behalf the original check was issued) may issue to the owner or holder of the check a substitute check. The drawer or official shall issue the substitute check by the last day of the fiscal year after the fiscal year in which the original check was issued—
<br>
<br>(1) using the current date; and
<br>
<br>(2) drawn on the account of the drawer of the original check or another account available for payment of the substitute.
<br>
<br>(d) A substitute check issued under this section—
<br>
<br>(1) may be paid only if the original check has not been paid;
<br>
<br>(2) shall include information necessary to identify the original check;
<br>
<br>(3) that is drawn on the Treasury—
<br>
<br>(A) is deemed to be an original check; and
<br>
<br>(B) is paid under the same conditions as the original check; and
<br>
<br>(4) does not relieve a disbursing or certifying official from liability to the Government for payment resulting from erroneously issuing the original check.
<br>
<br>(e) Before issuing a substitute check under this section, the Secretary may require the owner or holder of the original check to agree to indemnify the Government with security in the form and amount the Secretary decides is necessary.
<br>
<br>(f) The Secretary may waive any provision of this section as may be necessary to ensure that claimants receive timely payments.
<br>
<br>(g) Under conditions the Secretary may prescribe, the Secretary may delegate duties and powers of the Secretary under this section to the head of an agency. Consistent with a delegation from the Secretary under this subsection, the head of an agency may delegate those duties and powers to an officer or employee of the agency.
