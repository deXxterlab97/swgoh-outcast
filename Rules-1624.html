<br>
<br>"No person shall discharge any untreated sewage from a cruise vessel into the waters of the Alexander Archipelago or the navigable waters of the United States within the State of Alaska or within the Kachemak Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve.
<br>"SEC. 1404. LIMITATIONS ON DISCHARGE OF TREATED SEWAGE OR GRAYWATER.
<br>
<br>"(a) No person shall discharge any treated sewage or graywater from a cruise vessel into the waters of the Alexander Archipelago or the navigable waters of the United States within the State of Alaska or within the Kachemak Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve unless—

<br>"(4) the cruise vessel is not in an area where the discharge of treated sewage or graywater is prohibited.
<br>
<br>"(b) The Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary, may promulgate regulations allowing the discharge of treated sewage or graywater, otherwise prohibited under paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, where the discharge meets effluent standards determined by the Administrator as appropriate for discharges into the marine environment. In promulgating such regulations, the Administrator shall take into account the best available scientific information on the environmental effects of the regulated discharges. The effluent discharge standards promulgated under this section shall, at a minimum, be consistent with all relevant State of Alaska water quality standards in force at the time of the enactment of this title [Dec. 21, 2000].
<br>
<br>"(c) Until such time as the Administrator promulgates regulations under paragraph (b) of this section, treated sewage and graywater may be discharged from vessels subject to this title in circumstances otherwise prohibited under paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, provided that—
<br>
<br>"(1) the discharge satisfies the minimum level of effluent quality specified in 40 CFR 133.102, as in effect on the date of enactment of this section [Dec. 21, 2000];
<br>
<br>"(2) the geometric mean of the samples from the discharge during any 30-day period does not exceed 20 fecal coliform/100 ml and not more than 10 percent of the samples exceed 40 fecal coliform/100 ml;

To the extent not otherwise being done by the owner, operator, master or other person in charge of a cruise vessel pursuant to section 1406, the owner, operator, master or other person in charge of a cruise vessel shall demonstrate continued compliance through periodic sampling. Such sampling and test results shall be considered environmental compliance records that must be made available for inspection pursuant to section 1406(d) of this title.
<br>"SEC. 1405. SAFETY EXCEPTION.
<br>
<br>"Sections 1403 and 1404 of this title shall not apply to discharges made for the purpose of securing the safety of the cruise vessel or saving life at sea, provided that all reasonable precautions have been taken for the purpose of preventing or minimizing the discharge.
<br>"SEC. 1406. INSPECTION AND SAMPLING REGIME.
<br>
<br>"(a) The Secretary shall incorporate into the commercial vessel examination program an inspection regime sufficient to verify that cruise vessels visiting ports in the State of Alaska or operating in the waters of the Alexander Archipelago or the navigable waters of the United States within the State of Alaska or within the Kachemak Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve are in full compliance with this title, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act [33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.], as amended, and any regulations issued thereunder, other applicable Federal laws and regulations, and all applicable international treaty requirements.

<br>"(1) examination of environmental compliance records and procedures; and
<br>
<br>"(2) inspection of the functionality and proper operation of installed equipment for abatement and control of any discharge.
<br>
<br>"(c) The inspection regime may—
<br>
<br>"(1) include unannounced inspections of any aspect of cruise vessel operations, equipment or discharges pertinent to the verification under subsection (a) of this section; and
<br>

The Administrator or Secretary shall promptly file in such court a certified copy of the record on which the order was issued. Such court shall not set aside or remand such order unless there is not substantial evidence in the record, taken as a whole, to support the finding of a violation or unless the Administrator's or Secretary's assessment of the penalty constitutes an abuse of discretion and shall not impose additional civil penalties for the same violation unless the Administrator's or Secretary's assessment of the penalty constitutes an abuse of discretion.
<br>
<br>"(7) Collection.—If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty—
<br>
<br>"(A) after the assessment has become final, or
<br>
<br>"(B) after a court in an action brought under subsection (6) has entered a final judgment in favor of the Administrator or Secretary, as the case may be, the Administrator or Secretary shall request the Attorney General to bring a civil action in an appropriate district court to recover the amount assessed (plus interest at currently prevailing rates from the date of the final order or the date of the final judgment, as the case may be).
