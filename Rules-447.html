<br>
<br>Nothing in this section—

<br>(2) Maximum liability
<br>
<br>The maximum liability of the Corporation, acting as receiver or in any other capacity, to any person having a claim against the receiver or the System institution for which such receiver is appointed shall equal the amount such claimant would have received if the Corporation had liquidated the assets and liabilities of such System institution without exercising the Corporation's authority under subsection (h) or section 2277a–10(a) of this title.
<br>(3) Additional payments authorized
<br>(A) In general

<br>
<br>(iii) acting based on a suit, claim, or cause of action purchased from, assigned by, or otherwise conveyed in whole or in part by a System institution or an affiliate of a System institution in connection with assistance provided under section 2277a–10(a) of this title; and

<br>(h) Bridge Farm Credit System banks
<br>(1) Organization
<br>(A) Purpose
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>When 1 or more System banks are in default, or when the Corporation anticipates that 1 or more System banks may become in default, the Corporation may, in its discretion, organize, and the Farm Credit Administration may, in its discretion, charter, 1 or more System banks, with the powers and attributes of System banks, subject to the provisions of this subsection, to be referred to as "bridge System banks".
<br>(ii) Intent of Congress
<br>
<br>It is the intent of the Congress that, in order to prevent unnecessary hardship or losses to the customers of any System bank in default with respect to which a bridge System bank is chartered, the Corporation should—
<br>
<br>(I) continue to honor commitments made by the System bank in default to creditworthy customers; and
<br>
<br>(II) not interrupt or terminate adequately secured loans which are transferred under this subsection and are being repaid by the debtor in accordance with the terms of the loan instrument.
<br>(B) Authorities
<br>
<br>Once chartered by the Farm Credit Administration, the bridge System bank may—
<br>
<br>(i) assume such liabilities of the System bank or banks in default or in danger of default as the Corporation may, in its discretion, determine to be appropriate;
<br>
<br>(ii) purchase such assets of the System bank or banks in default or in danger of default as the Corporation may, in its discretion, determine to be appropriate; and
<br>
<br>(iii) perform any other temporary function which the Corporation may, in its discretion, prescribe in accordance with this chapter.
