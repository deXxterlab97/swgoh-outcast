<br>In selecting an estuary habitat restoration project, the Secretary shall consider the following factors:
<br>
<br>(A) Whether the project is part of an approved Federal or State estuary management or habitat restoration plan.
<br>
<br>(B) The technical feasibility of the project.
<br>
<br>(C) The scientific merit of the project.
<br>
<br>(D) Whether the project will encourage increased coordination and cooperation among Federal, State, and local government agencies.

<br>
<br>(F) Whether the project is cost-effective.
<br>
<br>(G) Whether the State in which the non-Federal interest is proposing the project has a dedicated source of funding to acquire or restore estuary habitat, natural areas, and open spaces for the benefit of estuary habitat restoration or protection.
<br>
<br>(H) Other factors that the Secretary determines to be reasonable and necessary for consideration.
