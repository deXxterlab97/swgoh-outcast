<br>1967 Act
<br>
<br>In the codification of 5 U.S.C. 5547, the words "premium pay under this subchapter" were substituted for "premium compensation provided by this Act" appearing in the source statute—section 603 of the Federal Employees Pay Act of 1945, as amended (former 5 U.S.C. 943). This amendment of 5 U.S.C. 5547 is made for clarity and precision of reference and in recognition that the source statutes for certain sections of subchapter V of chapter 55 of title 5 include statutes that were not a part of the Federal Employees Pay Act of 1949. Specifically, 5 U.S.C. 5544(a) is based in part on section 23 (2d proviso) of the act of March 28, 1934, as amended by 76 Stat. 360; and 5 U.S.C. 5545(d) is based on section 804 of the Classification Act of 1949, as added by Public Law 89–512, 80 Stat. 318. Also, 5 U.S.C. 5541(2)(xi) in effect excludes employees subject to 5 U.S.C. 5544 from the operation of 5 U.S.C. 5547.

<br>
<br>(iv) unless the analysis conducted under section 2(e) of the Border Patrol Agent Pay Reform Act of 2014 indicates that, in order to more adequately fulfill the operational requirements of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, such border patrol agents should be allowed to elect or be assigned to the level 1 border patrol rate of pay or the level 2 border patrol rate of pay, a border patrol agent shall be assigned to the basic border patrol rate of pay if the agent works—

<br>(a) An employee in a missing status is entitled to receive or have credited to his account, for the period he is in that status, the same pay and allowances to which he was entitled at the beginning of that period or may become entitled thereafter. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an employee in a missing status on or after January 1, 1965, is entitled—
<br>
<br>(1) to payment for annual leave which accrued to his account on or after January 1, 1965, but which was forfeited under section 6304 of this title because he was unable to use that leave by virtue of his missing status; or
<br>
<br>(2) to have all of that leave restored to him and credited to a separate leave account in accordance with the provisions of section 6304(d)(2) of this title.
<br>
<br>An employee shall elect in writing, within 90 days immediately following December 14, 1973, or within 90 days immediately following the termination of his missing status, whichever is later, whether he desires payment for the leave under clause (1) of this subsection or credit of the leave under clause (2) of this subsection. Payment under clause (1) of this subsection shall be at the employee's rate of basic pay in effect at the time the leave was forfeited.
<br>
<br>(b) Entitlement to pay and allowances under subsection (a) of this section ends on the date of—
<br>
<br>(1) receipt by the head of the agency concerned of evidence that the employee is dead; or
<br>
<br>(2) death prescribed or determined under section 5565 of this title.
<br>
<br>That entitlement does not end—
<br>
<br>(A) on the expiration of the term of service or employment of an employee while he is in a missing status; or
<br>
<br>(B) earlier than the dates prescribed in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection if the employee dies while he is in a missing status.
<br>
<br>(c) An employee who is officially determined to be absent from his post of duty without authority is indebted to the United States for payments of amounts credited to his account under subsection (a) of this section for the period of that absence.
<br>
<br>(d) When an employee in a missing status is continued in that status under section 5565 of this title, he continues to be entitled to have pay and allowances credited under subsection (a) of this section.

<br>
<br>(a) An allotment (including one for the purchase of United States savings bonds) made by an employee before he was in a missing status may be continued for the period he is in that status, notwithstanding the end of the period for which the allotment was made.
<br>
<br>(b) In the absence of an allotment or when an allotment is insufficient for a purpose authorized by the head of the agency concerned, he or his designee may authorize such a new or increased allotment as circumstances warrant, which is payable for the period the employee concerned is in a missing status.
<br>
<br>(c) All allotments from the pay and allowances of an employee in a missing status may not total more than the amount of pay and allowances he is permitted to allot under regulations prescribed by the head of the agency concerned.
<br>
<br>(d) A premium paid by the United States on insurance issued on the life of an employee, which is unearned because it covers a period after his death, reverts to the appropriation of the agency concerned.
<br>
<br>(e) Subject to subsections (f) and (g) of this section, the head of the agency concerned or his designee may direct the initiation, continuance, discontinuance, increase, decrease, suspension, or resumption of an allotment from the pay and allowances of an employee in a missing status when that action is in the interests of the employee, his dependents, or the United States.
<br>
<br>(f) When the head of the agency concerned officially reports that an employee in a missing status is alive, an allotment under subsections (a)–(d) of this section may be paid, subject to section 5562 of this title, until the date the head of the agency concerned receives evidence that the employee is dead or has returned to the controllable jurisdiction of the agency concerned.
<br>
<br>(g) When an employee in a missing status is continued in that status under section 5565 of this title, an allotment under subsections (a)–(d) of this section may be continued, increased, or initiated.
<br>
<br>(h) When the head of the agency concerned considers it essential for the well-being and protection of the dependents of an employee in active service (other than an employee in a missing status), he may, with or without the consent of the employee and subject to termination on specific request of the employee—
<br>
<br>(1) direct the payment of a new allotment from the pay of the employee;
<br>
<br>(2) increase or decrease the amount of an allotment made by the employee; and
<br>
<br>(3) continue payment of an allotment of the employee which has expired.

<br>(a) For the purpose of this section, "household and personal effects" and "household effects" may include, in addition to other authorized weight allowances, one privately owned motor vehicle which may be shipped at United States expense.
<br>
<br>(b) Transportation (including packing, crating, draying, temporarily storing, and unpacking of household and personal effects) may be provided for the dependents and household and personal effects of an employee in active service (without regard to pay grade) who is officially reported as dead, injured, or absent for more than 29 days in a status listed in section 5561(5) (A)–(E) of this title to—
<br>

<br>
<br>(d) Transportation on request of a dependent may be authorized under this section only when there is a reasonable relationship between the circumstances of the dependent and the destination requested.

Before a sale, and if practicable, a reasonable effort shall be made to determine the desires of interested persons. The net proceeds from the sale shall be sent to the owner or other person entitled thereto under regulations prescribed by the head of the agency concerned.

When a claim is filed, the Administrator of General Services shall allow or disallow it. A claim that is allowed shall be paid from the appropriation for refunding money erroneously received and covered. If a claim is not filed before the end of 5 years from the date the proceeds are covered into the Treasury, it is barred from being acted on by the Administrator of General Services or the courts.

<br>§5565. Agency review
<br>
<br>(a) When an employee has been in a missing status almost 12 months and no official report of his death or the circumstances of his continued absence has been received by the head of the agency concerned, he shall have the case fully reviewed. After that review and the end of 12 months in a missing status, or after any later review which shall be made when warranted by information received or other circumstances, the head of the agency concerned or his designee may—
<br>
<br>(1) direct the continuance of his missing status, if there is a reasonable presumption that the employee is alive; or
<br>
<br>(2) make a finding of death.
<br>
<br>(b) When a finding of death is made under subsection (a) of this section, it shall include the date death is presumed to have occurred for the purpose of the ending of crediting pay and allowances and settlement of accounts. That date is—
<br>
<br>(1) the day after the day on which the 12 months in a missing status ends; or
<br>
<br>(2) a day determined by the head of the agency concerned or his designee when the missing status has been continued under subsection (a) of this section.
<br>
<br>(c) For the purpose of determining status under this section, a dependent of an employee in active service is deemed an employee. A determination under this section made by the head of the agency concerned or his designee is conclusive on all other agencies of the United States. This section does not entitle a dependent to pay, allowances, or other compensation to which he is not otherwise entitled.
