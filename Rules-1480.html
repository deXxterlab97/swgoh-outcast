<br>§722. Eligibility and individualized plan for employment
<br>(a) Eligibility
<br>(1) Criterion for eligibility
<br>
<br>An individual is eligible for assistance under this subchapter if the individual—
<br>
<br>(A) has undergone an assessment for determining eligibility and vocational rehabilitation needs and as a result has been determined to be an individual with a disability under section 705(20)(A) of this title; and
<br>
<br>(B) requires vocational rehabilitation services to prepare for, secure, retain, advance in, or regain employment that is consistent with the individual's strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities, interests, and informed choice.
<br>
<br>For purposes of an assessment for determining eligibility and vocational rehabilitation needs under this chapter, an individual shall be presumed to have a goal of an employment outcome.
<br>(2) Presumption of benefit
<br>(A) Applicants
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, an individual shall be presumed to be an individual that can benefit in terms of an employment outcome from vocational rehabilitation services under section 705(20)(A) of this title.
<br>(B) Responsibilities
<br>
<br>Prior to determining under this subsection that an applicant described in subparagraph (A) is unable to benefit due to the severity of the individual's disability or that the individual is ineligible for vocational rehabilitation services, the designated State unit shall explore the individual's abilities, capabilities, and capacity to perform in work situations, through the use of trial work experiences, as described in section 705(2)(D) of this title, with appropriate supports provided through the designated State unit. Such experiences shall be of sufficient variety and over a sufficient period of time to determine the eligibility of the individual. In providing the trial experiences, the designated State unit shall provide the individual with the opportunity to try different employment experiences, including supported employment, and the opportunity to become employed in competitive integrated employment.
<br>(3) Presumption of eligibility
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, an individual who has a disability or is blind as determined pursuant to title II or title XVI of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 et seq. and 1381 et seq.) shall be—
<br>
<br>(i) considered to be an individual with a significant disability under section 705(21)(A) of this title; and
<br>
<br>(ii) presumed to be eligible for vocational rehabilitation services under this subchapter (provided that the individual intends to achieve an employment outcome consistent with the unique strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities, interests, and informed choice of the individual) unless the designated State unit involved can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that such individual is incapable of benefiting in terms of an employment outcome due to the severity of the individual's disability (as of the date of the determination).
<br>(B) Construction
<br>
<br>Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to create an entitlement to any vocational rehabilitation service.
<br>(4) Use of existing information
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>To the maximum extent appropriate and consistent with the requirements of this part, for purposes of determining the eligibility of an individual for vocational rehabilitation services under this subchapter and developing the individualized plan for employment described in subsection (b) for the individual, the designated State unit shall use information that is existing and current (as of the date of the determination of eligibility or of the development of the individualized plan for employment), including information available from other programs and providers, particularly information used by education officials and the Social Security Administration, information provided by the individual and the family of the individual, and information obtained under the assessment for determining eligibility and vocational rehabilitation needs.
<br>(B) Determinations by officials of other agencies
<br>
<br>Determinations made by officials of other agencies, particularly education officials described in section 721(a)(11)(D) of this title, regarding whether an individual satisfies one or more factors relating to whether an individual is an individual with a disability under section 705(20)(A) of this title or an individual with a significant disability under section 705(21)(A) of this title shall be used, to the extent appropriate and consistent with the requirements of this part, in assisting the designated State unit in making such determinations.
<br>(C) Basis
<br>
<br>The determination of eligibility for vocational rehabilitation services shall be based on—
<br>
<br>(i) the review of existing data described in section 705(2)(A)(i) of this title; and
<br>
<br>(ii) to the extent that such data is unavailable or insufficient for determining eligibility, the provision of assessment activities described in section 705(2)(A)(ii) of this title.
<br>(5) Determination of ineligibility
<br>
<br>If, after the designated State unit carries out the activities described in paragraph (2)(B), a review of existing data, and, to the extent necessary, the assessment activities described in section 705(2)(A)(ii) of this title, an individual who applies for services under this subchapter is determined not to be eligible for the services, or if an eligible individual receiving services under an individualized plan for employment is determined to be no longer eligible for the services—
<br>
<br>(A) the ineligibility determination shall be an individualized one, based on the available data, and shall not be based on assumptions about broad categories of disabilities;
<br>
<br>(B) the ineligibility determination involved shall be made only after providing an opportunity for full consultation with the individual or, as appropriate, the individual's representative;
<br>
<br>(C) the individual or, as appropriate, the individual's representative, shall be informed in writing (supplemented as necessary by other appropriate modes of communication consistent with the informed choice of the individual) of the ineligibility determination, including—
<br>
<br>(i) the reasons for the determination, including the clear and convincing evidence that forms the basis for the determination of ineligibility; and
<br>
<br>(ii) a description of the means by which the individual may express, and seek a remedy for, any dissatisfaction with the determination, including the procedures for review by an impartial hearing officer under subsection (c);
<br>
<br>(D) the individual shall be provided with a description of services available from the client assistance program under section 732 of this title and information on how to contact that program; and
<br>
<br>(E) any ineligibility determination that is based on a finding that the individual is incapable of benefiting in terms of an employment outcome shall be reviewed—
<br>
<br>(i) within 12 months; and
<br>
<br>(ii) thereafter, if such a review is requested by the individual or, if appropriate, by the individual's representative.
<br>(6) Timeframe for making an eligibility determination
<br>
<br>The designated State unit shall determine whether an individual is eligible for vocational rehabilitation services under this subchapter within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 60 days, after the individual has submitted an application for the services unless—
<br>
<br>(A) exceptional and unforeseen circumstances beyond the control of the designated State unit preclude making an eligibility determination within 60 days and the designated State unit and the individual agree to a specific extension of time; or
<br>
<br>(B) the designated State unit is exploring an individual's abilities, capabilities, and capacity to perform in work situations under paragraph (2)(B).
<br>(b) Development of an individualized plan for employment
<br>(1) Options for developing an individualized plan for employment
<br>
<br>If an individual is determined to be eligible for vocational rehabilitation services as described in subsection (a), the designated State unit shall complete the assessment for determining eligibility and vocational rehabilitation needs, as appropriate, and shall provide the eligible individual or the individual's representative, in writing and in an appropriate mode of communication, with information on the individual's options for developing an individualized plan for employment, including—
<br>
<br>(A) information on the availability of assistance from a qualified vocational rehabilitation counselor or, as appropriate, a disability advocacy organization in developing all or part of the individualized plan for employment for the individual, and the availability of technical assistance in developing all or part of the individualized plan for employment for the individual;

<br>
<br>(ii) a description of the availability of a client assistance program established pursuant to section 732 of this title and information about how to contact the client assistance program.
<br>(2) Individuals desiring to enter the workforce
<br>
<br>For an individual entitled to benefits under title II or XVI of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 et seq., 1381 et seq.) on the basis of a disability or blindness, the designated State unit shall provide to the individual general information on additional supports and assistance for individuals with disabilities desiring to enter the workforce, including assistance with benefits planning.
