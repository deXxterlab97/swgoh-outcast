<br>19	Of old, think you that we excuse ourselves to you? We speak before God in Christ; but all things, my dearly beloved, for your edification.
<br>20	For I fear lest perhaps when I come I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found by you such as you would not. Lest per- haps contentions, envyings, animosities, dissen- sions, detractions, whisperings, swellings, sedi- tions, be among you.
<br>21	Lest again, when I come, God humble me among you: and I mourn many of them that sinned before, and have not done penance for the uncleanness, and fornication, and lasciviousness, that they have committed.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 13
<br>
<br>Behold, this is the third time I am coming to you: In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word stand.
<br>2	I have told before, and foretell, as present, and now absent, to them that sinned before, and to all the rest, that if I come again, I will not spare.
<br>3	Do you seek a proof of Christ that speaketh in me, who towards you is not weak, but is mighty in you?
<br>4	For although he was crucified through weak- ness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him: but we shall live with him by the power of God towards you.
<br>5	Try you own selves if you be in the faith; prove ye yourselves. Know you not your own selves, that Christ Jesus is in you, unless perhaps you be reprobates?
<br>6	But I trust that you shall know that we are not reprobates.
<br>7	Now we pray God, that you may do no evil, not that we may appear approved, but that you may do that which is good, and that we may be as reprobates.
<br>8	For we can do nothing against the truth; but for the truth.
<br>9	For we rejoice that we are weak, and you are strong. This also we pray for, your perfection.
<br>10	Therefore I write these things, being ab- sent, that, being present, I may not deal more severely, according to the power which the Lord hath given me unto edification, and not unto de- struction.
<br>11	For the rest, brethren, rejoice, be perfect, take exhortation, be of one mind, have peace; and the God of peace and of love shall be with you.
<br> 
<br>
<br>12	Salute one another with a holy kiss.   All the saints salute you.
<br>13	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the charity of God, and the communication of the Holy Ghost be with you all. Amen.

<br>The Epistle of St. Paul to the Galatians
<br>
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>Paul, an apostle, not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead,
<br>2	And all the brethren who are with me, to the churches of Galatia.
<br>3	Grace be to you, and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,
<br>4	Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present wicked world, ac- cording to the will of God and our Father:
<br>5	To whom is glory for ever and ever. Amen. 6 I wonder that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ, unto
<br>another gospel.
<br>7	Which is not another, only there are some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.
<br>8	But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach a gospel to you besides that which we have preached to you, let him be anathema.
<br>9	As we said before, so now I say again: If any one preach to you a gospel, besides that which you have received, let him be anathema.
<br>10	For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? If I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.
<br>11	For I give you to understand, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not
<br> 
<br>according to man.
<br>12	For neither did I receive it of man, nor did I learn it; but by the revelation of Jesus Christ. 13 For you have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews’ religion: how that, beyond measure, I persecuted the church  of God, and
<br>wasted it.
<br>14	And I made progress in the Jews’ religion above many of my equals in my own nation, be- ing more abundantly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.
<br>15	But when it pleased him, who separated me from my mother’s womb, and called me by his grace,
<br>16	To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles, immediately I conde- scended not to flesh and blood.
<br>17	Neither went I to Jerusalem, to the apostles who were before me: but I went into Arabia, and again I returned to Damascus.
<br>18	Then, after three years, I went to Jerusalem, to see Peter, and I tarried with him fifteen days.
<br>19	But other of the apostles I saw none, saving James the brother of the Lord.
<br>20	Now the things which I write to you, be- hold, before God, I lie not.
<br>21	Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>22	And I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea, which were in Christ:
<br>23	But they had heard only: He, who perse- cuted us in times past, doth now preach the faith which once he impugned:
<br>24	And they glorified God in me.
<br>
<br>Chapter 2
<br>Then, after fourteen years, I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with me.
<br>2	And I went up according to revelation; and communicated to them the gospel, which I preach among the Gentiles, but apart to them who seemed to be some thing: lest perhaps I should run, or had run in vain.
<br>3	But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Gentile, was compelled to be circumcised.
<br>4	But because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privately to spy our liberty, which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into servitude.
<br>5	To whom we yielded not by subjection, no not for an hour, that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.
<br>6	But of them who seemed to be some thing, (what they were some time, it is nothing to me, God accepteth not the person of man,) for to me they that seemed to be some thing added nothing.
<br>7	But contrariwise, when they had seen that to me was committed the gospel of the uncircum- cision, as to Peter was that of the circumcision. 8 (For he who wrought in Peter to the apos- tleship of the circumcision, wrought in me also
<br>among the Gentiles.)
<br>9	And when they had known the grace that was given to me, James and Cephas and John,
<br> 
<br>who seemed to be pillars, gave to me and Barn- abas the right hands of fellowship: that we should go unto the Gentiles, and they unto the circumcision:
<br>10	Only that we should be mindful of the poor: which same thing also I was careful to do. 11 But when Cephas was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be
<br>blamed.
<br>12	For before that some came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fear- ing them who were of the circumcision.
<br>13	And to his dissimulation the rest of the Jews consented, so that Barnabas also was led by them into that dissimulation.
<br>14	But when I saw that they walked not up- rightly unto the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas before them all: If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of the Gentiles, and not as the Jews do, how dost thou compel the Gen- tiles to live as do the Jews?
<br>15	We by nature are Jews, and not of the Gen- tiles sinners.
<br>16	But knowing that man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ; we also believe in Christ Jesus, that we may be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: because by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified.
<br>17	But if while we seek to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners; is Christ then the minister of sin? God forbid.
<br>18	For if I build up again the things which I have destroyed, I make myself a prevaricator.
<br>19	For I, through the law, am dead to the law, that I may live to God: with Christ I am nailed to the cross.
<br>20	And I live, now not I; but Christ liveth in me. And that I live now in the flesh: I live in
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and delivered himself for me.
<br>21	I cast not away the grace of God. For if justice be by the law, then Christ died in vain.
<br>
<br>Chapter 3
<br>O senseless Galatians, who hath bewitched you that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been set forth, crucified among you?
<br>2	This only would I learn of you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?
<br>3	Are you so foolish, that, whereas you began in the Spirit, you would now be made perfect by the flesh?
<br>4	Have you suffered so great things in vain? If it be yet in vain.
<br>5	He therefore who giveth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you; doth he do it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of the faith?
<br>6	As it is written: Abraham believed God, and it was reputed to him unto justice.
<br>7	Know ye therefore, that they who are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.
<br>8	And the scripture, foreseeing, that God jus- tifieth the Gentiles by faith, told unto Abraham before: In thee shall all nations be blessed.
<br>9	Therefore they that are of faith, shall be blessed with faithful Abraham.
<br>10	For as many as are of the works of the law, are under a curse. For it is written: Cursed is every one, that abideth not in all things, which are written in the book of the law to do them.
<br>11	But that in the law no man is justified with God, it is manifest: because the just man liveth by faith.
<br> 
<br>12	But the law is not of faith: but, He that doth those things, shall live in them.
<br>13	Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written: Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:
<br>14	That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Christ Jesus: that we may receive the promise of the Spirit by faith.
<br>15	Brethren (I speak after the manner of man,) yet a man’s testament, if it be confirmed, no man despiseth, nor addeth to it.
<br>16	To Abraham were the promises made and to his seed. He saith not, And to his seeds, as of many: but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.
<br>17	Now this I say, that the testament which was confirmed by God, the law which was made after four hundred and thirty years, doth not disannul, to make the promise of no effect.
<br>18	For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise. But God gave it to Abraham by promise.
<br>19	Why then was the law? It was set because of transgressions, until the seed should come, to whom he made the promise, being ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.
<br>20	Now a mediator is not of one: but God is one.
<br>21	Was the law then against the promises of God? God forbid. For if there had been a law given which could give life, verily justice should have been by the law.
<br>22	But the scripture hath concluded all un- der sin, that the promise, by the faith of Jesus Christ, might be given to them that believe.
<br>23	But before the faith came, we were kept under the law shut up, unto that faith which was to be revealed.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>24	Wherefore the law was our pedagogue in Christ, that we might be justified by faith.
<br>25	But after the faith is come, we are no longer under a pedagogue.
<br>26	For you are all the children of God by faith, in Christ Jesus.
<br>27	For as many of you as have been baptized in Christ, have put on Christ.
<br>28	There is neither Jew nor Greek: there is neither bond nor free: there is neither male nor female. For you are all one in Christ Jesus.
<br>29	And if you be Christ’s, then are you the seed of Abraham, heirs according to the promise.
<br>
<br>Chapter 4
<br>
<br>Now I say, as long as the heir is a child, he dif- fereth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;
<br>2	But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed by the father:
<br>3	So we also, when we were children, were serving under the elements of the world.
<br>4	But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent his Son, made of a woman, made under the law:
<br>5	That he might redeem them who were under the law: that we might receive the adoption of sons.
<br>6	And because you are sons, God hath sent the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying: Abba, Father.
<br>7	Therefore now he is not a servant, but a son.
<br>And if a son, an heir also through God.
<br>8	But then indeed, not knowing God, you served them, who, by nature, are not gods.
<br>9	But now, after that you have known God, or rather are known by God: how turn you again to
<br> 
<br>the weak and needy elements, which you desire to serve again?
<br>10	You observe days, and months, and times, and years.
<br>11	I am afraid of you, lest perhaps I have laboured in vain among you.
<br>12	Be ye as I, because I also am as you: brethren, I beseech you: you have not injured me at all.
<br>13	And you know, how through infirmity of the flesh, I preached the gospel to you heretofore: and your temptation in my flesh,
<br>14	You despised not, nor rejected: but re- ceived me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.
<br>15	Where is then your blessedness? For I bear you witness, that, if it could be done, you would have plucked out your own eyes, and would have given them to me.
<br>16	Am I then become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?
<br>17	They are zealous in your regard not well: but they would exclude you, that you might be zealous for them.
<br>18	But be zealous for that which is good in a good thing always: and not only when I am present with you.
<br>19	My little children, of whom I am in labour again, until Christ be formed in you.
<br>20	And I would willingly be present with you now, and change my voice: because I am ashamed for you.
<br>21	Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, have you not read the law?
<br>22	For it is written that Abraham had two sons: the one by a bondwoman, and the other by a free woman.
<br>23	But he who was of the bondwoman, was born according to the flesh: but he of the free woman, was by promise.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>24	Which things are said by an allegory. For these are the two testaments. The one from mount Sina, engendering unto bondage; which is Agar:
<br>25	For Sina is a mountain in Arabia, which hath affinity to that Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.
<br>26	But that Jerusalem, which is above, is free: which is our mother.
<br>27	For it is written: Rejoice, thou barren, that bearest not: break forth and cry, thou that tra- vailest not: for many are the children of the des- olate, more than of her that hath a husband.
<br>28	Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.
<br>29	But as then he, that was born according to the flesh, persecuted him that was after the spirit; so also it is now.
<br>30	But what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son; for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the free woman.
<br>31	So then, brethren, we are not the children of the bondwoman, but of the free: by the free- dom wherewith Christ has made us free.
<br>
<br>Chapter 5
<br>Stand fast, and be not held again under the yoke of bondage.
<br>2	Behold, I Paul tell you, that if you be cir- cumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.
<br>3	And I testify again to every man circum- cising himself, that he is a debtor to the whole law.
<br>4	You are made void of Christ, you who are justified in the law: you are fallen from grace.
<br>5	For we in spirit, by faith, wait for the hope of justice.
<br> 
<br>6	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision: but faith that worketh by charity.
<br>7	You did run well, who hath hindered you, that you should not obey the truth?
<br>8	This persuasion is not from him that calleth you.
<br>9	A little leaven corrupteth the whole lump.
<br>10	I have confidence in you in the Lord: that you will not be of another mind: but he that troubleth you, shall bear the judgment, whoso- ever he be.
<br>11	And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumci- sion, why do I yet suffer persecution? Then is the scandal of the cross made void.
<br>12	I would they were even cut off, who trouble you.
<br>13	For you, brethren, have been called unto liberty: only make not liberty an occasion to the flesh, but by charity of the spirit serve one another.
<br>14	For all the law is fulfilled in one word: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
<br>15	But if you bite and devour one another; take heed you be not consumed one of another. 16 I say then, walk in the spirit, and you shall
<br>not fulfil the lusts of the flesh.
<br>17	For the flesh lusteth against the spirit: and the spirit against the flesh; for these are contrary one to another: so that you do not the things that you would.
<br>18	But if you are led by the spirit, you are not under the law.
<br>19	Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are fornication, uncleanness, immodesty, luxury,
<br>20	Idolatry, witchcrafts, enmities, con- tentions, emulations, wraths, quarrels, dissen- sions, sects,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>21	Envies, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like.   Of the which I foretell you, as I have foretold to you, that they who do such things shall not obtain the kingdom of God.
<br>22	But the fruit of the Spirit is, charity, joy, peace, patience, benignity, goodness, longanim- ity,
<br>23	Mildness, faith, modesty, continency, chastity. Against such there is no law.
<br>24	And they that are Christ’s, have crucified their flesh, with the vices and concupiscences.
<br>25	If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.
<br>26	Let us not be made desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying on another.
<br>
<br>Chapter 6
<br>
<br>Brethren, and if a man be overtaken in any fault, you, who are spiritual, instruct such a one in the spirit of meekness, considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.
<br>2	Bear ye one another’s burdens; and so you shall fulfil the law of Christ.
<br>3	For if any man think himself to be some thing, whereas he is nothing, he deceiveth him- self.
<br>4	But let every one prove his own work, and so he shall have glory in himself only, and not in another.
<br>5	For every one shall bear his own burden.
<br>6	And let him that is instructed in the word, communicate to him that instructeth him, in all good things.
<br>7	Be not deceived, God is not mocked.
<br>8	For what things a man shall sow, those also shall he reap. For he that soweth in his flesh, of the flesh also shall reap corruption. But he that
<br> 
<br>soweth in the spirit, of the spirit shall reap life everlasting.
<br>9	And in doing good, let us not fail.   For in due time we shall reap, not failing.
<br>10	Therefore, whilst we have time, let us work good to all men, but especially to those who are of the household of the faith.
<br>11	See what a letter I have written to you with my own hand.
<br>12	For as many as desire to please in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised, only that they may not suffer the persecution of the cross of Christ.
<br>13	For neither they themselves who are cir- cumcised, keep the law; but they will have you to be circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.
<br>14	But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ; by whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.
<br>15	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.
<br>16	And whosoever shall follow this rule, peace on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God. 17 From henceforth let no man be troublesome to me; for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus in
<br>my body.
<br>18 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren. Amen.

<br>The Epistle of St. Paul to the Ephesians
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>
<br>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, to all the saints who are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus.
<br>2	Grace be to you, and peace from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
<br>3	Blessed by the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with spiritual blessings in heavenly places, in Christ:
<br>4	As he chose us in him before the founda- tion of the world, that we should be holy and unspotted in his sight in charity.
<br>5	Who hath predestinated us unto the adop- tion of children through Jesus Christ unto him- self: according to the purpose of his will:
<br>6	Unto the praise of the glory of his grace, in which he hath graced us in his beloved son.
<br>7	In whom we have redemption through his blood, the remission of sins, according to the riches of his grace,
<br>8	Which hath superabounded in us in all wis- dom and prudence,
<br>9	That he might make known unto us the mys- tery of his will, according to his good pleasure, which he hath purposed in him,
<br>10	In the dispensation of the fulness of times, to re-establish all things in Christ, that are in heaven and on earth, in him.
<br> 
<br>11	In whom we also are called by lot, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things according to the counsel of his will.
<br>12	That we may be unto the praise of his glory, we who before hoped Christ:
<br>13	In whom you also, after you had heard the word of truth, (the gospel of your salvation;) in whom also believing, you were signed with the holy Spirit of promise,
<br>14	Who is the pledge of our inheritance, unto the redemption of acquisition, unto the praise of his glory.
<br>15	Wherefore I also, hearing of your faith that is in the Lord Jesus, and of your love towards all the saints,
<br>16	Cease not to give thanks for you, making commemoration of you in my prayers,
<br>17	That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and of revelation, in the knowledge of him:
<br>18	The eyes of your heart enlightened, that you may know what the hope is of the glory of his inheritance in the saints.
<br>19	And what is the exceeding greatness of his power towards us, who believe according to the operation of the might of his power,
<br>20	Which he wrought in Christ, raising him
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>up from the dead, and setting him on his right hand in the heavenly places.
<br>21	Above all principality, and power, and virtue, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come.
<br>22	And he hath subjected all things under his feet, and hath made him head over all the church, 23 Which is his body, and the fulness of him
<br>who is filled all in all.
<br>
<br>Chapter 2
<br>And you, when you were dead in your offences, and sins,
<br>2	Wherein in time past you walked accord- ing to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of this air, of the spirit that now worketh on the children of unbelief:
<br>3	In which also we all conversed in time past, in the desires of our flesh, fulfilling the will of the flesh and of our thoughts, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest:
<br>4	But God, (who is rich in mercy,) for his ex- ceeding charity wherewith he loved us,
<br>5	Even when we were dead in sins, hath quick- ened us together in Christ, (by whose grace you are saved,)
<br>6	And hath raised us up together, and hath made us sit together in the heavenly places, through Christ Jesus.
<br>7	That he might shew in the ages to come the abundant riches of his grace, in his bounty towards us in Christ Jesus.
<br>8	For by grace you are saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, for it is the gift of God;
<br>9	Not of works, that no man may glory.
<br>10	For we are his workmanship, created in
<br> 
<br>Christ Jesus in good works, which God hath pre- pared that we should walk in them.
<br>11	For which cause be mindful that you, being heretofore Gentiles in the flesh, who are called uncircumcision by that which is called circumci- sion in the flesh, made by hands;
<br>12	That you were at that time without Christ, being aliens from the conversation of Israel, and strangers to the testament, having no hope of the promise, and without God in this world.
<br>13	But now in Christ Jesus, you, who some time were afar off, are made nigh by the blood of Christ.
<br>14	For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and breaking down the middle wall of par- tition, the enmities in his flesh:
<br>15	Making void the law of commandments contained in decrees; that he might make the two in himself into one new man, making peace;
<br>16	And might reconcile both to God in one body by the cross, killing the enmities in himself.
<br>17	And coming, he preached peace to you that were afar off, and peace to them that were nigh.
<br>18	For by him we have access both in one Spirit to the Father.
<br>19	Now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners; but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and the domestics of God,
<br>20	Built upon the foundation of the apos- tles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone:
<br>21	In whom all the building, being framed to- gether, groweth up into an holy temple in the Lord.
<br>22	In whom you also are built together into an habitation of God in the Spirit.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 3
<br>For this cause, I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ, for you Gentiles;
<br>2 If yet you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me towards you: 3 How that, according to revelation, the mys- tery has been made known to me, as I have writ-
<br>ten above in a few words;
<br>4	As you reading, may understand my knowl- edge in the mystery of Christ,
<br>5	Which in other generations was not known to the sons of men, as it is now revealed to his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit:
<br>6	That the Gentiles should be fellow heirs, and of the same body, and co-partners of his promise in Christ Jesus, by the gospel:
<br>7	Of which I am made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God, which is given to me according to the operation of his power:
<br>8	To me, the least of all the saints, is given this grace, to preach among the Gentiles, the unsearchable riches of Christ,
<br>9	And to enlighten all men, that they may see what is the dispensation of the mystery which hath been hidden from eternity in God, who cre- ated all things:
<br>10	That the manifold wisdom of God may be made known to the principalities and powers in heavenly places through the church,
<br>11	According to the eternal purpose, which he made, in Christ Jesus our Lord:
<br>12	In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.
<br>13	Wherefore I pray you not to faint at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.
<br>14	For this cause I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
<br>15	Of whom all paternity in heaven and earth is named,
<br> 
<br>16	That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened by his Spirit with might unto the inward man,
<br>17	That Christ may dwell by faith in your hearts; that being rooted and founded in charity, 18 You may be able to comprehend, with all the saints, what is the breadth, and length, and
<br>height, and depth:
<br>19	To know also the charity of Christ, which surpasseth all knowledge, that you may be filled unto all the fulness of God.
<br>20	Now to him who is able to do all things more abundantly than we desire or understand, according to the power that worketh in us;
<br>21	To him be glory in the church, and in Christ Jesus unto all generations, world without end. Amen.
<br>
<br>Chapter 4
<br>I therefore, a prisoner in the Lord, beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation in which you are called,
<br>2	With all humility and mildness, with pa- tience, supporting one another in charity.
<br>3	Careful to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
<br>4	One body and one Spirit; as you are called in one hope of your calling.
<br>5	One Lord, one faith, one baptism.
<br>6	One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in us all.
<br>7	But to every one of us is given grace, accord- ing to the measure of the giving of Christ.
<br>8	Wherefore he saith: Ascending on high, he led captivity captive; he gave gifts to men.
<br>9	Now that he ascended, what is it, but be- cause he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>10	He that descended is the same also that ascended above all the heavens, that he might fill all things.
<br>11	And he gave some apostles, and some prophets, and other some evangelists, and other some pastors and doctors,
<br>12	For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:
<br>13	Until we all meet into the unity of faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the age of the fulness of Christ;
<br>14	That henceforth we be no more children tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the wickedness of men, by cunning craftiness, by which they lie in wait to deceive
<br>15	But doing the truth in charity, we may in all things grow up in him who is the head, even Christ:
<br>16	From whom the whole body, being com- pacted and fitly joined together, by what every joint supplieth, according to the operation in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body, unto the edifying of itself in charity.
<br>17	This then I say and testify in the Lord: That henceforward you walk not as also the Gen- tiles walk in the vanity of their mind,
<br>18	Having their understanding darkened, be- ing alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blind- ness of their hearts.
<br>19	Who despairing, have given themselves up to lasciviousness, unto the working of all un- cleanness, unto the working of all uncleanness, unto covetousness.
<br>20	But you have not so learned Christ;
<br>21	If so be that you have heard him, and have been taught in him, as the truth is in Jesus:
<br> 
<br>22	To put off, according to former conversa- tion, the old man, who is corrupted according to the desire of error.
<br>23	And be renewed in the spirit of your mind: 24 And put on the new man, who according to God is created in justice and holiness of truth. 25 Wherefore putting away lying, speak ;ye the truth every man with his neighbour; for we
<br>are members one of another.
<br>26	Be angry, and sin not. Let not the sun go down upon your anger.
<br>27	Give not place to the devil.
<br>28	He that stole, let him now steal no more; but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have something to give to him that suffereth need.
<br>29	Let no evil speech proceed from your mouth; but that which is good, to the edifica- tion of faith, that it may administer grace to the hearers.
<br>30	And grieve not the holy Spirit of God: whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemp- tion.
<br>31	Let all bitterness, and anger, and indigna- tion, and clamour, and blasphemy, be put away from you, with all malice.
<br>32	And be ye kind one to another; merciful, forgiving one another, even as God hath forgiven you in Christ.
<br>
<br>Chapter 5
<br>Be ye therefore followers of God, as most dear children;
<br>2 And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath delivered himself for us, an oblation and a sacrifice to God for an odour of sweetness. 3 But fornication, and all uncleanness, or cov- etousness, let it not so much as be named among
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>you, as becometh saints:
<br>4	Or obscenity, or foolish talking, or scurril- ity, which is to no purpose; but rather giving of thanks.
<br>5	For know you this and understand, that no fornicator, or unclean, or covetous person (which is a serving of idols), hath inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
<br>6	Let no man deceive you with vain words. For because of these things cometh the anger of God upon the children of unbelief.
<br>7	Be ye not therefore partakers with them.
<br>8	For you were heretofore darkness, but now light in the Lord. Walk then as children of the light.
<br>9	For the fruit of the light is in all goodness, and justice, and truth;
<br>10	Proving what is well pleasing to God:
<br>11	And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.
<br>12	For the things that are done by them in secret, it is a shame even to speak of.
<br>13	But all things that are reproved, are made manifest by the light; for all that is made mani- fest is light.
<br>14	Wherefore he saith: Rise thou that sleep- est, and arise from the dead: and Christ shall enlighten thee.
<br>15	See therefore, brethren, how you walk cir- cumspectly: not as unwise,
<br>16	But as wise: redeeming the time, because the days are evil.
<br>17	Wherefore become not unwise, but under- standing what is the will of God.
<br>18	And be not drunk with wine, wherein is luxury; but be ye filled with the holy Spirit,
<br>19	Speaking to yourselves in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual canticles, singing and mak- ing melody in your hearts to the Lord;
<br> 
<br>20	Giving thanks always for all things, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to God and the Father:
<br>21	Being subject one to another, in the fear of Christ.
<br>22	Let women be subject to their husbands, as to the Lord:
<br>23	Because the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ is the head of the church. He is the saviour of his body.
<br>24	Therefore as the church is subject to Christ, so also let the wives be to their husbands in all things.
<br>25	Husbands, love your wives, as Christ also loved the church, and delivered himself up for it:
<br>26	That he might sanctify it, cleansing it by the laver of water in the word of life:
<br>27	That he might present it to himself a glo- rious church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any; such thing; but that it should be holy, and with- out blemish.
<br>28	So also ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife, loveth himself.
<br>29	For no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, as also Christ doth the church:
<br>30	Because we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.
<br>31	For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they shall be two in one flesh.
<br>32	This is a great sacrament; but I speak in Christ and in the church.
<br>33	Nevertheless let every one of you in par- ticular love his wife as himself: and let the wife fear her husband.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 6
<br>Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is just.
<br>2	Honour thy father and thy mother, which is the first commandment with a promise:
<br>3	That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest be long lived upon earth.
<br>4	And you, fathers, provoke not your children to anger; but bring them up in the discipline and correction of the Lord.
<br>5	Servants, be obedient to them that are your lords according to the flesh, with fear and trem- bling, in the simplicity of your heart, as to Christ:
<br>6	Not serving to the eye, as it were pleasing men, but, as the servants of Christ doing the will of God from the heart,
<br>7	With a good will serving, as to the Lord, and not to men.
<br>8	Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man shall do, the same shall he receive from the Lord, whether he be bond, or free.
<br>9	And you, masters, do the same things to them, forbearing threatenings, knowing that the Lord both of them and you is in heaven; and there is no respect of persons with him.
<br>10	Finally, brethren, be strengthened in the Lord, and in the might of his power.
<br>11	Put you on the armour of God, that you may be able to stand against the deceits of the devil.
<br>12	For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood; but against principalities and power, against the rulers of the world of this dark- ness, against the spirits of wickedness in the high places.
<br>13	Therefore take unto you the armour of God, that you may be able to resist in the evil day, and to stand in all things perfect.
<br> 
<br>14	Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of justice,
<br>15	And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace:
<br>16	In all things taking the shield of faith, wherewith you may be able to extinguish all the fiery darts of the most wicked one.
<br>17	And take unto you the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit (which is the word of God).
<br>18	By all prayer and supplication praying at all times in the spirit; and in the same watch- ing with all instance and supplication for all the saints:
<br>19	And for me, that speech may be given me, that I may open my mouth with confidence, to make known the mystery of the gospel.
<br>20	For which I am an ambassador in a chain, so that therein I may be bold to speak according as I ought.
<br>21	But that you also may know the things that concern me, and what I am doing, Tychicus, my dearest brother and faithful minister in the Lord, will make known to you all things:
<br>22	Whom I have sent to you for this same pur- pose, that you may know the things concerning us, and that he may comfort your hearts.
<br>23	Peace be to the brethren and charity with faith, from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
<br>24	Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption. Amen.

<br>The Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>Paul and Timothy, the servants of Jesus Christ; to all the saints in Christ Jesus, who are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons.
<br>2	Grace be unto you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
<br>3	I give thanks to my God in every remem- brance of you,
<br>4	Always in all my prayers making supplica- tion for you all, with joy;
<br>5	For your communication in the gospel of Christ from the first day until now.
<br>6	Being confident of this very thing, that he, who hath begun a good work in you, will perfect it unto the day of Christ Jesus.
<br>7	As it is meet for me to think this for you all, for that I have you in my heart; and that in my bands, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of my joy.
<br>8	For God is my witness, how I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.
<br>9	And this I pray, that your charity may more and more abound in knowledge, and in all un- derstanding:
<br>10	That you may approve the better things, that you may be sincere and without offence unto the day of Christ,
<br>11	Filled with the fruit of justice, through Je-
<br> 
<br>sus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.
<br>12	Now, brethren, I desire you should know, that the things which have happened to me, have fallen out rather to the furtherance of the gospel: 13 So that my bands are made manifest in
<br>Christ, in all the court, and in all other places;
<br>14	And many of the brethren in the Lord, growing confident by my bands, are much more bold to speak the word of God without fear.
<br>15	Some indeed, even out of envy and con- tention; but some also for good will preach Christ.
<br>16	Some out of charity, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.
<br>17	And some out of contention preach Christ not sincerely: supposing that they raise affliction to my bands.
<br>18	But what then? So that by all means, whether by occasion, or by truth, Christ be preached: in this also I rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.
<br>19	For I know that this shall fall out to me unto salvation, through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
<br>20	According to my expectation and hope; that in nothing I shall be confounded, but with all confidence, as always, so now also shall Christ be magnified in my body, wither it be by life, or by death.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>21	For to me, to live is Christ; and to die is gain.
<br>22	And if to live in the flesh, that is to me the fruit of labour, and what I shall choose I know not.
<br>23	But I am straitened between two: having a desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ, a thing by far the better.
<br>24	But to abide still in the flesh, is needful for you.
<br>25	And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide, and continue with you all, for your furtherance and joy of faith:
<br>26	That your rejoicing may abound in Christ Jesus for me, by my coming to you again.
<br>27	Only let your conversation be worthy of the gospel of Christ: that, whether I come and see you, or, being absent, may hear of you, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one mind labouring together for the faith of the gospel.
<br>28	And in nothing be ye terrified by the ad- versaries: which to them is a cause of perdition, but to you of salvation, and this from God:
<br>29	For unto you it is given for Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for him.
<br>30	Having the same conflict as that which you have seen in me, and now have heard of me.
<br>
<br>Chapter 2
<br>If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of charity, if any society of the spirit, if any bowels of commiseration:
<br>2	Fulfil ye my joy, that you may be of one mind, having the same charity, being of one ac- cord, agreeing in sentiment.
<br>3	Let nothing be done through contention, nei- ther by vain glory: but in humility, let each es- teem others better than themselves:
<br> 
<br>4	Each one not considering the things that are his own, but those that are other men’s.
<br>5	For let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:
<br>6	Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:
<br>7	But emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men, and in habit found as a man.
<br>8	He humbled himself, becoming obedient unto death, even to the death of the cross.
<br>9	For which cause God also hath exalted him, and hath given him a name which is above all names:
<br>10	That in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those that are in heaven, on earth, and under the earth:
<br>11	And that every tongue should confess that the Lord Jesus Christ is in the glory of God the Father.
<br>12	Wherefore, my dearly beloved, (as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but much more now in my absence,) with fear and trembling work out your salvation.
<br>13	For it is God who worketh in you, both to will and to accomplish, according to his good will.
<br>14	And do ye all things without murmurings and hesitations;
<br>15	That you may be blameless, and sincere children of God, without reproof, in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation; among whom you shine as lights in the world.
<br>16	Holding forth the word of life to my glory in the day of Christ, because I have not run in vain, nor laboured in vain.
<br>17	Yea, and if I be made a victim upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice, and congratulate with you all.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>18	And for the selfsame thing do you also re- joice, and congratulate with me.
<br>19	And I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Tim- othy unto you shortly, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know the things concerning you.
<br>20	For I have no man so of the same mind, who with sincere affection is solicitous for you.
<br>21	For all seek the things that are their own; not the things that are Jesus Christ’s.
<br>22	Now know ye the proof of him, that as a son with the father, so hath he served with me in the gospel.
<br>23	Him therefore I hope to send unto you im- mediately, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.
<br>24	And I trust in the Lord, that I myself also shall come to you shortly.
<br>25	But I have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow labourer, and fellow soldier, but your apostle, and he that hath ministered to my wants.
<br>26	For indeed he longed after you all: and was sad, for that you had heard that he was sick.
<br>27	For indeed he was sick, nigh unto death; but God had mercy on him; and not only on him, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.
<br>28	Therefore I sent him the more speedily: that seeing him again, you may rejoice, and I may be without sorrow.
<br>29	Receive him therefore with all joy in the Lord; and treat with honour such as he is.
<br>30	Because for the work of Christ he came to the point of death: delivering his life, that he might fulfil that which on your part was wanting towards my service.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 3
<br>As to the rest, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not wearisome, but to you it is necessary.
<br>2	Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, be- ware of the concision.
<br>3	For we are the circumcision, who in spirit serve God; and glory in Christ Jesus, not having confidence in the flesh.
<br>4	Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other thinketh he may have confi- dence in the flesh, I more,
<br>5	Being circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an He- brew of the Hebrews; according to the law, a Pharisee:
<br>6	According to zeal, persecuting the church of God; according to the justice that is in the law, conversing without blame.
<br>7	But the things that were gain to me, the same I have counted loss for Christ.
<br>8	Furthermore I count all things to be but loss for the excellent knowledge of Jesus Christ my Lord; for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but as dung, that I may gain Christ:
<br>9	And may be found in him, not having my justice, which is of the law, but that which is of the faith of Christ Jesus, which is of God, justice in faith:
<br>10	That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable to his death,
<br>11	If by any means I may attain to the resur- rection which is from the dead.
<br>12	Not as though I has already attained, or were already perfect; but I follow after, if I may by any means apprehend, wherein I am also ap- prehended by Christ Jesus.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>13	Brethren, I do not count myself to have apprehended. But one thing I do: forgetting the things that are behind, and stretching forth my- self to those that are before,
<br>14	I press towards the mark, to the prize of the supernal vocation of God in Christ Jesus.
<br>15	Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, be thus minded; and if in any thing you be oth- erwise minded, this also God will reveal to you. 16 Nevertheless whereunto we are come, that we be of the same mind, let us also continue in
<br>the same rule.
<br>17 Be ye followers of me, brethren, and ob- serve them who walk so as you have our model. 18 For many walk, of whom I have told you often (and now tell you weeping), that they are
<br>enemies of the cross of Christ;
<br>19	Whose end is destruction; whose God is their belly; and whose glory is in their shame; who mind earthly things.
<br>20	But our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, our Lord Jesus Christ,
<br>21	Who will reform the body of our lowness, made like to the body of his glory, according to the operation whereby also he is able to subdue all things unto himself.
<br>
<br>Chapter 4
<br>Therefore, my dearly beloved brethren, and most desired, my joy and my crown; so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved.
<br>2	I beg of Evodia, and I beseech Syntyche, to be of one mind in the Lord.
<br>3	And I entreat thee also, my sincere com- panion, help those women who have laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement and the rest of my fellow labourers, whose names are in
<br> 
<br>the book of life.
<br>4	Rejoice in the Lord always; again, I say, re- joice.
<br>5	Let your modesty be known to all men. The Lord is nigh.
<br>6	Be nothing solicitous; but in every thing, by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your petitions be made known to God.
<br>7	And the peace of God, which surpasseth all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.
<br>8	For the rest, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever modest, whatsoever just, whatsoever holy, whatsoever lovely, whatsoever of good fame, if there be any virtue, if any praise of discipline, think on these things.
<br>9	The things which you have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, these do ye, and the God of peace shall be with you.
<br>10	Now I rejoice in the Lord exceedingly, that now at length your thought for me hath flour- ished again, as you did also think; but you were busied.
<br>11	I speak not as it were for want. For I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, to be content therewith.
<br>12	I know both how to be brought low, and I know how to abound: (everywhere, and in all things I am instructed) both to be full, and to be hungry; both to abound, and to suffer need.
<br>13	I can do all these things in him who strengtheneth me.
<br>14	Nevertheless you have done well in commu- nicating to my tribulation.
<br>15	And you also know, O Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but you only:
<br> 
<br>
<br>16	For unto Thessalonica also you sent once and again for my use.
<br>17	Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit that may abound to your account.
<br>18	But I have all, and abound: I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things you sent, an odour of sweetness, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God.
<br>19	And may my God supply all your want, according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.
<br>20	Now to God and our Father be glory world without end. Amen.
<br>21	Salute ye every saint in Christ Jesus.
<br>22	The brethren who are with me, salute you. All the saints salute you; especially they that are of Caesar’s household.
<br>23	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.  Amen.

<br>The Epistle of St. Paul to the Colossians
<br>
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, and Timothy, a brother,
<br>2	To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ Jesus, who are at Colossa.
<br>3	Grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. We give thanks to God, and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you.
<br>4	Hearing your faith in Christ Jesus, and the love which you have towards all the saints.
<br>5	For the hope that is laid up for you in heaven, which you have heard in the word of the truth of the gospel,
<br>6	Which is come unto you, as also it is in the whole world, and bringeth forth fruit and groweth, even as it doth in you, since the day you heard and knew the grace of God in truth.
<br>7	As you learned of Epaphras, our most beloved fellow servant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ Jesus;
<br>8	Who also hath manifested to us your love in the spirit.
<br>9	Therefore we also, from the day that we heard it, cease not to pray for you, and to beg that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will, in all wisdom, and spiritual understanding:
<br>10	That you may walk worthy of God, in all things pleasing; being fruitful in every good
<br> 
<br>work, and increasing in the knowledge of God:
<br>11	Strengthened with all might, according to the power of his glory, in all patience and long- suffering with joy,
<br>12	Giving thanks to God the Father, who hath made us worthy to be partakers of the lot of the saints in light:
<br>13	Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the king- dom of the Son of his love,
<br>14	In whom we have redemption through his blood, the remission of sins;
<br>15	Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:
<br>16	For in him were all things created in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones, or dominations, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him and in him.
<br>17	And he is before all, and by him all things consist.
<br>18	And he is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he may hold the primacy: 19 Because in him, it hath well pleased the
<br>Father, that all fullness should dwell;
<br>20 And through him to reconcile all things unto himself, making peace through the blood of his cross, both as to the things that are on
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>earth, and the things that are in heaven.
<br>21	And you, whereas you were some time alienated and enemies in mind in evil works:
<br>22	Yet now he hath reconciled in the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unspotted, and blameless before him:
<br>23	If so ye continue in the faith, grounded and settled, and immoveable from the hope of the gospel which you have heard, which is preached in all the creation that is under heaven, whereof I Paul am made a minister.
<br>24	Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up those things that are wanting of the sufferings of Christ, in my flesh, for his body, which is the church:
<br>25	Whereof I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God, which is given me towards you, that I may fulfil the word of God: 26 The mystery which hath been hidden from ages and generations, but now is manifested to
<br>his saints,
<br>27	To whom God would make known the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ, in you the hope of glory.
<br>28	Whom we preach, admonishing every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus.
<br>29	Wherein also I labour, striving according to his working which he worketh in me in power.
<br>
<br>Chapter 2
<br>For I would have you know, what manner of care I have for you and for them that are at Laodicea, and whosoever have not seen my face in the flesh: 2 That their hearts may be comforted, being instructed in charity, and unto all riches of ful- ness of understanding, unto the knowledge of the
<br> 
<br>mystery of God the Father and of Christ Jesus:
<br>3	In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
<br>4	Now this I say, that no man may deceive you by loftiness of words.
<br>5	For though I be absent in body, yet in spirit I am with you; rejoicing, and beholding your or- der, and the steadfastness of your faith which is in Christ.
<br>6	As therefore you have received Jesus Christ the Lord, walk ye in him;
<br>7	Rooted and built up in him, and confirmed in the faith, as also you have learned, abounding in him in thanksgiving.
<br>8	Beware lest any man cheat you by philoso- phy, and vain deceit; according to the tradition of men, according to the elements of the world, and not according to Christ:
<br>9	For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead corporeally;
<br>10	And you are filled in him, who is the head of all principality and power:
<br>11	In whom also you are circumcised with cir- cumcision not made by hand, in despoiling of the body of the flesh, but in the circumcision of Christ:
<br>12	Buried with him in baptism, in whom also you are risen again by the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him up from the dead. 13 And you, when you were dead in your sins, and the uncircumcision of your flesh; he hath quickened together with him, forgiving you all
<br>offences:
<br>14	Blotting out the handwriting of the decree that was against us, which was contrary to us. And he hath taken the same out of the way, fas- tening it to the cross:
<br>15	And despoiling the principalities and pow- ers, he hath exposed them confidently in open shew, triumphing over them in himself.
<br> 
<br>
<br>The Epistle of St.  Paul to the Colossians	1517
<br> 
<br>
<br>16	Let no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink, or in respect of a festival day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbaths,
<br>17	Which are a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ.
<br>18	Let no man seduce you, willing in humil- ity, and religion of angels, walking in the things which he hath not seen, in vain puffed up by the sense of his flesh,
<br>19	And not holding the head, from which the whole body, by joints and bands, being supplied with nourishment and compacted, groweth unto the increase of God.
<br>20	If then you be dead with Christ from the elements of this world, why do you yet decree as though living in the world?
<br>21	Touch not, taste not, handle not:
<br>22	Which all are unto destruction by the very use, according to the precepts and doctrines of men.
<br>23	Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in superstition and humility, and not sparing the body; not in any honour to the filling of the flesh.
<br>
<br>Chapter 3
<br>Therefore, if you be risen with Christ, seek the things that are above; where Christ is sitting at the right hand of God:
<br>2	Mind the things that are above, not the things that are upon the earth.
<br>3	For you are dead; and your life is hid with Christ in God.
<br>4	When Christ shall appear, who is your life, then you also shall appear with him in glory.
<br>5	Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, lust, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is the service of idols.
<br> 
<br>
<br>6	For which things the wrath of God cometh upon the children of unbelief,
<br>7	In which you also walked some time, when you lived in them.
<br>8	But now put you also all away: anger, in- dignation, malice, blasphemy, filthy speech out of your mouth.
<br>9	Lie not one to another: stripping yourselves of the old man with his deeds,
<br>10	And putting on the new, him who is re- newed unto knowledge, according to the image of him that created him.
<br>11	Where there is neither Gentile nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian nor Scythian, bond nor free. But Christ is all, and in all.
<br>12	Put ye on therefore, as the elect of God, holy, and beloved, the bowels of mercy, benig- nity, humility, modesty, patience:
<br>13	Bearing with one another, and forgiving one another, if any have a complaint against an- other: even as the Lord hath forgiven you, so do you also.
<br>14	But above all these things have charity, which is the bond of perfection:
<br>15	And let the peace of Christ rejoice in your hearts, wherein also you are called in one body: and be ye thankful.
<br>16	Let the word of Christ dwell in you abun- dantly, in all wisdom: teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual can- ticles, singing in grace in your hearts to God.
<br>17	All whatsoever you do in word or in work, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, giv- ing thanks to God and the Father by him.
<br>18	Wives, be subject to your husbands, as it behoveth in the Lord.
<br>19	Husbands, love your wives, and be not bit- ter towards them.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>20	Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing to the Lord.
<br>21	Fathers, provoke not your children to in- dignation, lest they be discouraged.
<br>22	Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh, not serving to the eye, as pleasing men, but in simplicity of heart, fearing God.
<br>23	Whatsoever you do, do it from the heart, as to the Lord, and not to men:
<br>24	Knowing that you shall receive of the Lord the reward of inheritance. Serve ye the Lord Christ.
<br>25	For he that doth wrong, shall receive for that which he hath done wrongfully: and there is no respect of persons with God.
<br>
<br>Chapter 4
<br>
<br>Masters, do to your servants that which is just and equal: knowing that you also have a master in heaven.
<br>2	Be instant in prayer; watching in it with thanksgiving:
<br>3	Praying withal for us also, that God may open unto us a door of speech to speak the mys- tery of Christ (for which also I am bound;)
<br>4	That I may make it manifest as I ought to speak.
<br>5	Walk with wisdom towards them that are without, redeeming the time.
<br>6	Let your speech be always in grace seasoned with salt: that you may know how you ought to answer every man.
<br>7	All the things that concern me, Tychicus, our dearest brother, and faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord, will make known to you,
<br> 
<br>8	Whom I have sent to you for this same pur- pose, that he may know the things that concern you, and comfort your hearts,
<br>9	With Onesimus, a most beloved and faithful brother, who is one of you. All things that are done here, they shall make known to you.
<br>10	Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, saluteth you, and Mark, the cousin german of Barnabus, touching whom you have received command- ments; if he come unto you, receive him:
<br>11	And Jesus, that is called Justus: who are of the circumcision: these only are my helpers in the kingdom of God; who have been a comfort to me.
<br>12	Epaphras saluteth you, who is one of you, a servant of Christ Jesus, who is always solicitous for you in prayers, that you may stand perfect, and full in all the will of God.
<br>13	For I bear him testimony that he hath much labour for you, and for them that are at Laodicea, and them at Hierapolis.
<br>14	Luke, the most dear physician, saluteth you: and Demas.
<br>15	Salute the brethren who are at Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church that is in his house.
<br>16	And when this epistle shall have been read with you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans: and that you read that which is of the Laodiceans.
<br>17	And say to Archippus: Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.
<br>18	The salutation of Paul with my own hand. Be mindful of my bands. Grace be with you. Amen

<br>The First Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians
<br>
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>Paul and Sylvanus and Timothy: to the church of the Thessalonians, in God the Father, and in the Lord Jesus Christ.
<br>2	Grace be to you and peace. We give thanks to God always for you all; making a remem- brance of you in our prayers without ceasing,
<br>3	Being mindful of the work of your faith, and labour, and charity, and of the enduring of the hope of our Lord Jesus Christ before God and our Father:
<br>4	Knowing, brethren beloved of God, your election:
<br>5	For our gospel hath not been unto you in word only, but in power also, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much fulness, as you know what manner of men we have been among you for your sakes.
<br>6	And you became followers of us, and of the Lord; receiving the word in much tribulation, with joy of the Holy Ghost:
<br>7	So that you were made a pattern to all that believe in Macedonia and in Achaia.
<br>8	For from you was spread abroad the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia, and in Achaia, but also in every place, your faith which is to- wards God, is gone forth, so that we need not to speak any thing.
<br>9	For they themselves relate of us, what man-
<br> 
<br>ner of entering in we had unto you; and how you turned to God from idols, to serve the living and true God.
<br>10	And to wait for his Son from heaven (whom he raised up from the dead,) Jesus, who hath delivered us from the wrath to come.
<br>
<br>Chapter 2
<br>For yourselves know, brethren, our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain:
<br>2 But having suffered many things before, and been shamefully treated (as you know) at Philippi, we had confidence in our God, to speak unto you the gospel of God in much carefulness. 3 For our exhortation was not of error, nor of
<br>uncleanness, nor in deceit:
<br>4	But as we were approved by God that the gospel should be committed to us:   even so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God, who proveth our hearts.
<br>5	For neither have we used, at any time, the speech of flattery, as you know; nor taken an occasion of covetousness, God is witness:
<br>6	Nor sought we glory of men, neither of you, nor of others.
<br>7	Whereas we might have been burdensome to you, as the apostles of Christ: but we became little ones in the midst of you, as if a nurse should
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>cherish her children:
<br>8	So desirous of you, we would gladly impart unto you not only the gospel of God, but also our own souls: because you were become most dear unto us.
<br>9	For you remember, brethren, our labour and toil: working night and day, lest we should be chargeable to any of you, we preached among you the gospel of God.
<br>10	You are witnesses, and God also, how ho- lily, and justly, and without blame, we have been to you that have believed:
<br>11	As you know in what manner, entreating and comforting you, (as a father doth his chil- dren,)
<br>12	We testified to every one of you, that you would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.
<br>13	Therefore, we also give thanks to God with- out ceasing: because, that when you had re- ceived of us the word of the hearing of God, you received it not as the word of men, but (as it is indeed) the word of God, who worketh in you that have believed.
<br>14	For you, brethren, are become followers of the churches of God which are in Judea, in Christ Jesus: for you also have suffered the same things from your own coutrymen, even as they have from the Jews,
<br>15	Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and the prophets, and have persecuted us, and please not God, and are adversaries to all men;
<br>16	Prohibiting us to speak to the Gentiles, that they may be saved, to fill up their sins al- ways: for the wrath of God is come upon them to the end.
<br>17	But we, brethren, being taken away from you for a short time, in sight, not in heart, have hastened the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.
<br> 
<br>18	For we would have come unto you, I Paul indeed, once and again: but Satan hath hindered us.
<br>19	For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of glory? Are not you, in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?
<br>20	For you are our glory and joy.
<br>
<br>Chapter 3
<br>For which cause, forbearing no longer, we thought it good to remain at Athens alone:
<br>2	And we sent Timothy, our brother, and the minister of God in the gospel of Christ, to con- firm you and exhort you concerning your faith:
<br>3	That no man should be moved in these tribu- lations: for yourselves know, that we are ap- pointed thereunto.
<br>4	For even when we were with you, we foretold you that we should suffer tribulations, as also it is come to pass, and you know.
<br>5	For this cause also, I, forbearing no longer, sent to know your faith: lest perhaps he that tempteth should have tempted you, and our labour should be made vain.
<br>6	But now when Timothy came to us from you, and related to us your faith and charity, and that you have a good remembrance of us always, desiring to see us as we also to see you; 7 Therefore we were comforted, brethren, in you, in all our necessity and tribulation, by your
<br>faith,
<br>8	Because now we live, if you stand in the Lord.
<br>9	For what thanks can we return to God for you, in all the joy wherewith we rejoice for you before our God,
<br>10	Night and day more abundantly praying that we may see your face, and may accomplish
<br> 
<br>
<br>The First Epistle of St.  Paul to the Thessalonians	1521
<br> 
<br>
<br>those things that are wanting to your faith?
<br>11	Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you.
<br>12	And may the Lord multiply you, and make you abound in charity towards one another, and towards all men: as we do also towards you,
<br>13	To confirm your hearts without blame, in holiness, before God and our Father, at the com- ing of our Lord Jesus Christ, with all his saints. Amen.
<br>
<br>Chapter 4
<br>For the rest therefore, brethren, we pray and be- seech you in the Lord Jesus, that as you have received from us, how you ought to walk, and to please God, so also you would walk, that you may abound the more.
<br>2	For you know what precepts I have given to you by the Lord Jesus.
<br>3	For this is the will of God, your sanctifica- tion; that you should abstain from fornication;
<br>4	That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour:
<br>5	Not in the passion of lust, like the Gentiles that know not God:
<br>6	And that no man overreach, nor circumvent his brother in business: because the Lord is the avenger of all these things, as we have told you before, and have testified.
<br>7	For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto sanctification.
<br>8	Therefore, he that despiseth these things, despiseth not man, but God, who also hath given his holy Spirit in us.
<br>9	But as touching the charity of brotherhood, we have no need to write to you: for yourselves have learned of God to love one another.
<br>10	For indeed you do it towards all the
<br> 
<br>
<br>brethren in all Macedonia. But we entreat you, brethren, that you abound more:
<br>11	And that you use your endeavour to be quiet, and that you do your own business, and work with your own hands, as we commanded you: and that you walk honestly towards them that are without; and that you want nothing of any man’s.
<br>12	And we will not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning them that are asleep, that you be not sorrowful, even as others who have no hope.
<br>13	For if we believe that Jesus died, and rose again; even so them who have slept through Je- sus, will God bring with him.
<br>14	For this we say unto you in the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who remain unto the coming of the Lord, shall not prevent them who have slept.
<br>15	For the Lord himself shall come down from heaven with commandment, and with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God: and the dead who are in Christ, shall rise first.
<br>16	Then we who are alive, who are left, shall be taken up together with them in the clouds to meet Christ, into the air, and so shall we be always with the Lord.
<br>17	Wherefore, comfort ye one another with these words.
<br>
<br>Chapter 5
<br>But of the times and moments, brethren, you need not, that we should write to you;
<br>2 For yourselves know perfectly, that the day of the Lord shall so come, as a thief in the night. 3 For when they shall say, peace and security; then shall sudden destruction come upon them, as the pains upon her that is with child, and they
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>shall not escape.
<br>4	But you, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.
<br>5	For all you are the children of light, and children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.
<br>6	Therefore, let us not sleep, as others do; but let us watch, and be sober.
<br>7	For they that sleep, sleep in the night; and they that are drunk, are drunk in the night.
<br>8	But let us, who are of the day, be sober, having on the breastplate of faith and charity, and for a helmet the hope of salvation.
<br>9	For God hath not appointed us unto wrath, but unto the purchasing of salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,
<br>10	Who died for us; that, whether we watch or sleep, we may live together with him.
<br>11	For which cause comfort one another; and edify one another, as you also do.
<br>12	And we beseech you, brethren, to know them who labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you:
<br>13	That you esteem them more abundantly in charity, for their work’s sake. Have peace with them.
<br>14	And we beseech you, brethren, rebuke the unquiet, comfort the feeble minded, support the weak, be patient towards all men.
<br>15	See that none render evil for evil to any man; but ever follow that which is good towards each other, and towards all men.
<br>16	Always rejoice.
<br>17	Pray without ceasing.
<br>18	In all things give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you all.
<br>19	Extinguish not the spirit.
<br>20	Despise not prophecies.
<br>21	But prove all things; hold fast that which is good.
<br> 
<br>22	From all appearance of evil refrain your- selves.
<br>23	And may the God of peace himself sanctify you in all things; that your whole spirit, and soul, and body, may be preserved blameless in the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
<br>24	He is faithful who hath called you, who also will do it.
<br>25	Brethren, pray for us.
<br>26	Salute all the brethren with a holy kiss.
<br>27	I charge you by the Lord, that this epistle be read to all the holy brethren.
<br>28	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.

<br>
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>Paul, and Sylvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
<br>2	Grace unto you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
<br>3	We are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brethren, as it is fitting, because your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of ev- ery one of you towards each other, aboundeth:
<br>4	So that we ourselves also glory in you in the churches of God, for your patience and faith, and in all your persecutions and tribulations, which you endure,
<br>5	For an example of the just judgment of God, that you may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which also you suffer.
<br>6	Seeing it is a just thing with God to repay tribulation to them that trouble you:
<br>7	And to you who are troubled, rest with us when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven, with the angels of his power:
<br>8	In a flame of fire, giving vengeance to them who know not God, and who obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.
<br>9	Who shall suffer eternal punishment in de- struction, from the face of the Lord, and from the glory of his power:
<br>10	When he shall come to be glorified in his
<br> 
<br>saints, and to be made wonderful in all them who have believed; because our testimony was believed upon you in that day.
<br>11	Wherefore also we pray always for you; that our God would make you worthy of his vo- cation, and fulfill all the good pleasure of his goodness and the work of faith in power;
<br>12	That the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God, and of the Lord Jesus Christ.
<br>
<br>Chapter 2
<br>And we beseech you, brethren,  by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and of our gathering together unto him:
<br>2	That you be not easily moved from your sense, nor be terrified, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by epistle, as sent from us, as if the day of the Lord were at hand.
<br>3	Let no man deceive you by any means, for unless there come a revolt first, and the man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition,
<br>4	Who opposeth, and is lifted up above all that is called God, or that is worshipped, so that he sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself as if he were God.
<br>5	Remember you not, that when I was yet with you, I told you these things?
<br> 
<br>
<br>1524	The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians
<br>
<br> 
<br>6	And now you know what withholdeth, that he may be revealed in his time.
<br>7	For the mystery of iniquity already worketh; only that he who now holdeth, do hold, until he be taken out of the way.
<br>8	And then that wicked one shall be revealed whom the Lord Jesus shall kill with the spirit of his mouth; and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming, him,
<br>9	Whose coming is according to the working of Satan, in all power, and signs, and lying wonders,
<br>10	And in all seduction of iniquity to them that perish; because they receive not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. Therefore God shall send them the operation of error, to believe lying:
<br>11	That all may be judged who have not be- lieved the truth, but have consented to iniquity.
<br>12	But we ought to give thanks to God al- ways for you, brethren, beloved of God, for that God hath chosen you firstfruits unto salvation, in sanctification of the spirit, and faith of the truth:
<br>13	Whereunto also he hath called you by our gospel, unto the purchasing of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
<br>14	Therefore, brethren, stand fast; and hold the traditions which you have learned, whether by word, or by our epistle.
<br>15	Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God and our Father, who hathloved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation, and good hope in grace,
<br>16	Exhort your hearts, and confirm you in ev- ery good work and word.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 3
<br>For the rest, brethren, pray for us, that the word of God may run, and may be glorified, even as among you;
<br>2 And that we may be delivered from impor- tunate and evil men; for all men have not faith. 3 But God is faithful, who will strengthen and
<br>keep you from evil.
<br>4	And we have confidence concerning you in the Lord, that the things which we command, you both do, and will do.
<br>5	And the Lord direct your hearts, in the char- ity of God, and the patience of Christ.
<br>6	And we charge you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw your- selves from every brother walking disorderly, and not according to the tradition which they have received of us.
<br>7	For yourselves know how you ought to imi- tate us: for we were not disorderly among you;
<br>8	Neither did we eat any man’s bread for noth- ing, but in labour and in toil we worked night and day, lest we should be chargeable to any of you.
<br>9	Not as if we had not power: but that we might give ourselves a pattern unto you, to imi- tate us.
<br>10	For also when we were with you, this we declared to you: that, if any man will not work, neither let him eat.
<br>11	For we have heard there are some among you who walk disorderly, working not at all, but curiously meddling.
<br>12	Now we charge them that are such, and beseech them by the Lord Jesus Christ, that, working with silence, they would eat their own bread.
<br>13	But you, brethren, be not weary in well doing.
<br> 
<br>
<br>The Second Epistle of St. Paul to the Thessalonians	1525
<br>
<br>14	And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and do not keep company with him, that he may be ashamed:
<br>15	Yet do not esteem him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.
<br>16	Now the Lord of peace himself give you everlasting peace in every place. The Lord be with you all.
<br>17	The salutation of Paul with my own hand; which is the sign in every epistle. So I write.
<br>18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

<br>The First Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>
<br>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the commandment of God our Savior, and of Christ Jesus our hope:
<br>2	To Timothy, his beloved son in faith. Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father, and from Christ Jesus our Lord.
<br>3	As I desired thee to remain at Ephesus when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some not to teach otherwise,
<br>4	Not to give heed to fables and endless ge- nealogies: which furnish questions rather than the edification of God, which is in faith.
<br>5	Now the end of the commandment is charity, from a pure heart, and a good conscience, and an unfeigned faith.
<br>6	From which things some going astray, are turned aside unto vain babbling:
<br>7	Desiring to be teachers of the law, under- standing neither the things they say, nor whereof they affirm.
<br>8	But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully:
<br>9	Knowing this, that the law is not made for the just man, but for the unjust and disobedient, for the ungodly, and for sinners, for the wicked and defiled, for murderers of fathers, and mur- derers of mothers, for manslayers,
<br> 
<br>10	For fornicators, for them who defile them- selves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and whatever other thing is contrary to sound doctrine,
<br>11	Which is according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed God, which hath been com- mitted to my trust.
<br>12	I give thanks who hath strengthened me, even to Christ Jesus our Lord, for that he hath counted me faithful, putting me in the ministry; 13 Who before was a blasphemer, and a per- secutor, and contumelious. But I obtained the mercy of God, because I did it ignorantly in un-
<br>belief.
<br>14	Now the grace of our Lord hath abounded exceedingly with faith and love, which is in Christ Jesus.
<br>15	A faithful saying, and worthy of all accep- tation, that Christ Jesus came into this world to save sinners, of whom I am the chief.
<br>16	But for this cause have I obtained mercy: that in me first Christ Jesus might shew forth all patience, for the information of them that shall believe in him unto life everlasting.
<br>17	Now to the king of ages, immortal, invisi- ble, the only God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.
<br>18	This precept I commend to thee, O son Timothy; according to the prophecies going be-
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>fore on thee, that thou war in them a good war- fare,
<br>19	Having faith and a good conscience, which some rejecting have made shipwreck concerning the faith.
<br>20	Of whom is Hymeneus and Alexander, whom I have delivered up to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.
<br>
<br>Chapter 2
<br>I desire therefore, first of all, that supplica- tions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all men:
<br>2	For kings, and for all that are in high station: that we may lead a quiet and a peaceable life in all piety and chastity.
<br>3	For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour,
<br>4	Who will have all men to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth.
<br>5	For there is one God, and one mediator of God and men, the man Christ Jesus:
<br>6	Who gave himself a redemption for all, a testimony in due times.
<br>7	Whereunto I am appointed a preacher and an apostle, (I say the truth, I lie not,) a doctor of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
<br>8	I will therefore that men pray in every place, lifting up pure hands, without anger and con- tention.
<br>9	In like manner women also in decent apparel: adorning themselves with modesty and sobriety, not with plaited hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly attire,
<br>10	But as it becometh women professing god- liness, with good works.
<br>11	Let the woman learn in silence, with all subjection.
<br> 
<br>12	But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to use authority over the man: but to be in silence.
<br>13	For Adam was first formed; then Eve.
<br>14	And Adam was not seduced; but the woman being seduced, was in the transgression. 15 Yet she shall be saved through childbear- ing; if she continue in faith, and love, and sanc-
<br>tification, with sobriety.
<br>
<br>Chapter 3
<br>
<br>A faithful saying: if a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.
<br>2	It behoveth therefore a bishop to be blame- less, the husband of one wife, sober, prudent, of good behaviour, chaste, given to hospitality, a teacher,
<br>3	Not given to wine, no striker, but modest, not quarrelsome, not covetous, but
<br>4	One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all chastity.
<br>5	But if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?
<br>6	Not a neophyte: lest being puffed up with pride, he fall into the judgment of the devil.
<br>7	Moreover he must have a good testimony of them who are without: lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.
<br>8	Deacons in like manner chaste, not double tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre:
<br>9	Holding the mystery of faith in a pure con- science.
<br>10	And let these also first be proved: and so let them minister, having no crime.
<br>11	The women in like manner chaste, not slan- derers, but sober, faithful in all things.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>12	Let deacons be the husbands of one wife: who rule well their children, and their own houses.
<br>13	For they that have ministered well, shall purchase to themselves a good degree, and much confidence in the faith which is in Christ Jesus. 14 These things I write to thee, hoping that I
<br>shall come to thee shortly.
<br>15	But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.
<br>16	And evidently great is the mystery of godli- ness, which was manifested in the flesh, was jus- tified in the spirit, appeared unto angels, hath been preached unto the Gentiles, is believed in the world, is taken up in glory.
<br>
<br>Chapter 4
<br>
<br>Now the Spirit manifestly saith, that in the last times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to spirits of error, and doctrines of devils,
<br>2	Speaking lies in hypocrisy, and having their conscience seared,
<br>3	Forbidding to marry, to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving by the faithful, and by them that have known the truth.
<br>4	For every creature of God is good, and noth- ing to be rejected that is received with thanks- giving:
<br>5	For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.
<br>6	These things proposing to the brethren, thou shalt be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nour- ished up in the words of faith, and of the good doctrine which thou hast attained unto.
<br> 
<br>7	But avoid foolish and old wives’ fables: and exercise thyself unto godliness.
<br>8	For bodily exercise is profitable to little: but godliness is profitable to all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.
<br>9	A faithful saying and worthy of all accepta- tion.
<br>10	For therefore we labor and are reviled, be- cause we hope in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, especially of the faithful.
<br>11	These things command and teach.
