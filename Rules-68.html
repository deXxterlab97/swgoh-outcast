<br>25	Behold I come against thee, thou destroy- ing mountain, saith the Lord, which corruptest the whole earth: and I will stretch out my hand upon thee, and will roll thee down from the rocks, and will make thee a burnt mountain.
<br>26	And they shall not take of thee a stone for the corner, nor a stone for foundations, but thou shalt be destroyed for ever, saith the Lord.
<br>27	Set ye up a standard in the land: sound with the trumpet among the nations: prepare the nations against her: call together against her the kings of Ararat, Menni, and Ascenez: num-
<br> 
<br>ber Taphsar against her, bring the horse as the stinging locust.
<br>28	Prepare the nations against her, the kings of Media, their captains, and all their rulers, and all the land of their dominion.
<br>29	And the land shall be in a commotion, and shall be troubled: for the design of the Lord against Babylon shall awake, to make the land of Babylon desert and uninhabitable.
<br>30	The valiant men of Babylon have forborne to fight, they have dwelt in holds: their strength hath failed, and they are become as women: her dwelling places are burnt, her bars are broken.
<br>31	One running post shall meet another, and messenger shall meet messenger: to tell the king of Babylon that his city is taken from one end to the other:
<br>32	And that the fords are taken, and the marshes are burnt with fire, and the men of war are affrighted.
<br>33	For thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: The daughter of Babylon is like a thrash- ingfloor, this is the time of her thrashing: yet a little while, and the time of her harvest shall come.
<br>34	Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon hath eaten me up, he hath devoured me: he hath made me as an empty vessel: he hath swallowed me up like a dragon, he hath filled his belly with my delicate meats, and he hath cast me out.
<br>35	The wrong done to me, and my flesh be upon Babylon, saith the habitation of Sion: and my blood upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, saith Jerusalem.
<br>36	Therefore thus saith the Lord: Behold I will judge thy cause, and will take vengeance for thee, and I will make her sea desolate, I and will dry up her spring.
<br>37	And Babylon shall be reduced to heaps, a dwelling place for dragons, an astonishment and
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>a hissing, because there is no inhabitant.
<br>38	They shall roar together like lions, they shall shake their manes like young lions.
<br>39	In their heat I will set them drink: and I will make them drunk, that they may slum- ber, and sleep an everlasting sleep, and awake no more, saith the Lord.
<br>40	I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, and like rams with kids.
<br>41	How is Sesach taken, and the renowned one of all the earth surprised? How is Babylon become an astonishment among the nations?
<br>42	The sea is come up over Babylon : she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof. 43 Her cities are become an astonishment, a land uninhabited and desolate, a land wherein none can dwell, nor son of man pass through it. 44 And I will visit against Bel in Babylon, and
<br>I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he had swallowed down: and the nations shall no more flow together to him, for the wall also of Babylon shall fall.
<br>45	Go out of the midst of her, my people: that every man may save his life from the fierce wrath of the Lord.
<br>46	And lest your hearts faint, and ye fear for the rumour that shall be heard in the land: and a rumour shall come in one year, and after this year another rumour: and iniquity in the land, and ruler upon ruler.
<br>47	Therefore behold the days come, and I will visit the idols of Babylon: and her whole land shall be confounded, and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.
<br>48	And the heavens and the earth, and all things that are in them shall give praise for Babylon: for spoilers shall come to her from the north, saith the Lord.
<br>49	And as Babylon caused that there should fall slain in Israel: so of Babylon there shall fall
<br> 
<br>slain in all the earth.
<br>50	You that have escaped the sword, come away, stand not still: remember the Lord afar off, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.
<br>51	We are confounded, because we have heard reproach: shame hath covered our faces: because strangers are come upon the sanctuaries of the house of the Lord.
<br>52	Therefore behold the days come, saith the Lord, and I will visit her graven things, and in all her land the wounded shall groan:
<br>53	If Babylon should mount up to heaven, and establish her strength on high: from me there should come spoilers upon her, saith the Lord.
<br>54	The noise of a cry from Babylon, and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans:
<br>55	Because the Lord hath laid Babylon waste, and destroyed out of her the great voice: and their wave shall roar like many waters: their voice hath made a noise:
<br>56	Because the spoiler is come upon her, that is, upon Babylon, and her valiant men are taken, and their bow is weakened, because the Lord, who is a strong revenger, will surely repay.
<br>57	And I will make her princes drunk, and her wise men, and her captains, and her rulers, and her valiant men: and they shall sleep an everlasting sleep, and shall awake no more, saith the king whose name is Lord of hosts.
<br>58	Thus saith the Lord of hosts: That broad wall of Babylon shall be utterly broken down, and her high gates shall be burnt with fire, and the labours of the people shall come to nothing, and of the nations shall go to the fire, and shall perish.
<br>59	The word that Jeremias the prophet com- manded Saraias the son of Nerias, the son of Maasias, when he went with king Sedecias to Babylon, in the fourth year of his reign: now Saraias was chief over the prophecy.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>60	And Jeremias wrote in one book all the evil that was to come upon Babylon: all these words that are written against Babylon.
<br>61	And Jeremias said to Saraias: When thou shalt come into Babylon, and shalt see, and shalt read all these words,
<br>62	Thou shalt say: O Lord, thou hast spoken against this place to destroy it: so that there should be neither man nor beast to dwell therein, and that it should be desolate for ever.
<br>63	And when thou shalt have made an end of reading this book, thou shalt tie a stone to it, and shalt throw it into the midst of the Eu- phrates:
<br>64	And thou shalt say: Thus shall Babylon sink, and she shall not rise up from the afflic- tion that I will bring upon her, and she shall be utterly destroyed. Thus far are the words of Jeremias.
<br>
<br>Chapter 52
<br>Sedecias was one and twenty years old when he began to reign: and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and the name of his mother was Ami- tal, the daughter of Jeremias of Lobna.
<br>2	And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord, according to all that Joakim had done.
<br>3	For the wrath of the Lord was against Jerusalem, and against Juda, till he cast them out from his presence: and Sedecias revolted from the king of Babylon.
<br>4	And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, the tenth day of the month, that Nabuchodonosor the king of Baby- lon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and they besieged it, and built forts against it round about.
<br>5	And the city was besieged until the eleventh
<br> 
<br>year of king Sedecias.
<br>6	And in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, a famine overpowered the city: and there was no food for the people of the land.
<br>7	And the city was broken up, and the men of war fled, and went out of the city in the night by the way of the gate that is between the two walls, and leadeth to the king’s garden, (the Chaldeans besieging the city round about,) and they went by the way that leadeth to the wilderness.
<br>8	But the army of the Chaldeans pursued af- ter the king: and they overtook Sedecias in the desert which is near Jericho: and all his compan- ions were scattered from him.
<br>9	And when they had taken the king, they carried him to the king of Babylon to Reblatha, which is in the land of Emath: and he gave judg- ment upon him.
<br>10	And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Sedecias before his eyes: and he slew all the princes of Juda in Reblatha.
<br>11	And he put out the eyes of Sedecias, and bound him with fetters, and the king of Babylon brought him into Babylon, and he put him in prison till the day of his death.
<br>12	And in the fifth month, the tenth day of the month, the same is the nineteenth year of Nabu- chodonosor, king of Babylon, came Nabuzardan the general of the army, who stood before the king of Babylon in Jerusalem.
<br>13	And he burnt the house of the Lord, and the king’s house, and all the houses of Jerusalem, and every great house he burnt with fire.
<br>14	And all the army of the Chaldeans that were with the general broke down all the wall of Jerusalem round about.
<br>15	But Nabuzardan the general carried away captives some of the poor people, and of the rest of the common sort who remained in the city, and of the fugitives that were fled over to the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.
<br>16	But of the poor of the land, Nabuzardan the general left some for vinedressers, and for husbandmen.
<br>17	The Chaldeans also broke in pieces the brazen pillars that were in the house of the Lord, and the bases, and the sea of brass that was in the house of the Lord: and they carried all the brass of them to Babylon.
<br>18	And they took the caldrons, and the flesh- hooks, and the psalteries, and the bowls, and the little mortars, and all the brazen vessels that had been used in the ministry: and
<br>19	The general took away the pitchers, and the censers, and the pots, and the basins, and the candlesticks, and the mortars, and the cups: as many as were of gold, in gold: and as many as were of silver, in silver:
<br>20	And the two pillars, and one sea, and twelve oxen of brass that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of the Lord: there was no weight of the brass of all these vessels.
<br>21	And concerning the pillars, one pillar was eighteen cubits high: and a cord of twelve cubits compassed it about: but the thickness thereof was four fingers, and it was hollow within.
<br>22	And chapiters of brass were upon both: and the height of one chapiter was five cubits: and network, and pomegranates were upon the chapiters round about, all of brass. The same of the second pillar, and the pomegranates.
<br>23	And there were ninety-six pomegranates hanging down: and the pomegranates being a hundred in all, were compassed with network.
<br>24	And the general took Saraias the chief priest, and Sophonias the second priest, and the three keepers of the entry.
<br>25	He also took out of the city one eunuch that was chief over the men of war: and seven men
<br> 
<br>of them that were near the king’s person, that were found in the city: and a scribe, an officer of the army who exercised the young soldiers: and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city.
<br>26	And Nabuzardan the general took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon, to Reblatha.
<br>27	And the king of Babylon struck them, and put them to death in Reblatha, in the land of Emath: and Juda was carried away captive out of his land.
<br>28	This is the people whom Nabuchodonosor carried away captive: in the seventh year, three thousand and twenty-three Jews.
<br>29	In the eighteenth year of Nabuchodonosor, eight hundred and thirty-two souls from Jerusalem.
<br>30	In the three and twentieth year of Nabu- chodonosor, Nabuzardan the general carried away of the Jews seven hundred and forty five souls. So all the souls were four thousand six hundred.
<br>31	And it came to pass in the seven and thirti- eth year of the captivity of Joachin king of Juda, in the twelfth month, the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Baby- lon, in the first year of his reign, lifted up the head of Joachin king of Juda, and brought him forth out of prison.
<br>32	And he spoke kindly to him, and he set his throne above the thrones of the kings that were with him in Babylon.
<br>33	And he changed his prison garments, and he ate bread before him always all the days of his life.
<br>34	And for his diet a continual provision was allowed him by the king of Babylon, every day a portion, until the day of his death, all the days of his life.

<br>
<br>Lamentations of Jeremias
<br>
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>Aleph.   How doth the city sit solitary that was full of people! how is the mistress of the Gen- tiles become as a widow: the princes of provinces made tributary!
<br>2	Beth. Weeping, she hath wept in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks: there is none to comfort her among all them that were dear to her: all her friends have despised her, and are become her enemies.
<br>3	Ghimel. Juda hath removed her dwelling place, because of her affliction, and the great- ness of her bondage; she hath dwelt among the nations, and she hath found no rest; all her per- secutors have taken her in the midst of straits.
<br>4	Daleth. The ways of Sion mourn, because there are none that come to the solemn feast: all her gates are broken down; her priests sigh; her virgins are in affliction; and she is oppressed with bitterness.
<br>5	He. Her adversaries are become her lords; her enemies are enriched; because the Lord hath spoken against her for the multitude of her iniq- uities; her children are led into captivity, before the face of the oppressor.
<br>6	Vau. And from the daughter of Sion, all her beauty is departed; her princes are become like rams that find no pastures; and they are gone away without strength before the face of the pursuer.
<br>7	Zain. Jerusalem hath remembered the days
<br> 
<br>
<br>of her affliction, and prevarication of all her de- sirable things which she had from the days of old, when her people fell in the enemy’s hand, and there was no helper; the enemies have seen her, and have mocked at her sabbaths.
<br>8	Heth. Jerusalem hath grievously sinned, therefore is she become unstable; all that hon- oured her, have despised her, because they have seen her shame; but she sighed, and turned back- ward.
<br>9	Teth. Her filthiness is on her feet, and she hath not remembered her end; she is wonderfully cast down, not having a comforter: behold, O Lord, my affliction, because the enemy is lifted up.
<br>10	Jod. The enemy hath put out his hand to all her desirable things: for she hath seen the Gentiles enter into her sanctuary, of whom thou gavest commandment that they should not enter into thy church.
<br>11	Caph. All her people sigh, they seek bread: they have given all their precious things for food to relieve the soul: see, 0 Lord, and consider, for I am become vile.
<br>12	Lamed. O all ye that pass by the way, attend, and see if there be any sorrow like to my sorrow: for he hath made a vintage of me, as the Lord spoke in the day of his fierce anger.
<br>13	Mem. From above he hath sent fire into my bones, and hath chastised me: he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back: he hath made me desolate, wasted with sorrow all
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>the day long.
<br>14	Nun. The yoke of my iniquities hath watched: they are folded together in his hand, and put upon my neck: my strength is weak- ened: the Lord hath delivered me into a hand, out of which I am not able to rise.
<br>15	Samech. The Lord hath taken away all my mighty men out of the midst of me: he hath called against me the time, to destroy my chosen men: the Lord hath trodden the winepress for the virgin daughter of Juda.
<br>16	Ain. Therefore do I weep, and my eyes run down with water: because the comforter, the relief of my soul, is far from me: my children are desolate because the enemy hath prevailed.
<br>17	Phe. Sion hath spread forth her hands, there is none to comfort her: the Lord hath com- manded against Jacob, his enemies are round about him: Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them.
<br>18	Sade. The Lord is just, for I have provoked his mouth to wrath: hear, I pray you, all ye people, and see my sorrow: my virgins, and my young men are gone into captivity.
<br>19	Coph. I called for my friends, but they deceived me: my priests and my ancients pined away in the city: while they sought their food, to relieve their souls.
<br>20	Res. Behold, 0 Lord, for I am in dis- tress, my bowels are troubled: my heart is turned within me, for I am full of bitterness: abroad the sword destroyeth and at home there is death alike.
<br>21	Sin. They have heard that I sigh, and there is none to comfort me: all my enemies have heard of my evil, they have rejoiced that thou hast done it: thou hast brought a day of consolation, and they shall be like unto me.
<br>22	Thau. Let all their evil be present before thee: and make vintage of them, as thou hast
<br> 
<br>made vintage of me for all my iniquities: for my sighs are many, and my heart is sorrowful.
<br>
<br>Chapter 2
<br>Aleph. How hath the Lord covered with obscu- rity the daughter of Sion in his wrath! how hath he cast down from heaven to the earth the glori- ous one of Israel, and hath not remembered his footstool in the day of his anger.
<br>2	Beth. The Lord hath cast down headlong, and hath not spared, all that was beautiful in Jacob: he hath destroyed in his wrath the strong holds of the virgin of Juda, and brought them down to the ground: he hath made the kingdom unclean, and the princes thereof.
<br>3	Ghimel. He hath broken in his fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy: and he hath kindled in Jacob as it were a flaming fire devour- ing round about.
<br>4	Daleth. He hath bent his bow as an enemy, he hath fixed his right hand as an adversary: and he hath killed all that was fair to behold in the tabernacle of the daughter of Sion, he hath poured out his indignation like fire.
<br>5	He. The Lord is become as an enemy: he hath cast down Israel headlong, he hath over- thrown all the walls thereof: he hath destroyed his strong holds, and hath multiplied in the dan- ghter of Juda the afflicted, both men and women. 6 Vau. And he hath destroyed his tent as a garden, he hath thrown down his tabernacle: the Lord hath caused feasts and sabbaths to be for- gotten in Sion: and hath delivered up king and priest to reproach, and to the indignation of his
<br>wrath.
<br>7 Zain. The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath cursed his sanctuary: he hath delivered the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>walls of the towers thereof into the hand of the enemy: they have made a noise in the house of the Lord, as in the day of a solemn feast.
<br>8	Heth. The Lord hath purposed to de- stroy the wall of the daughter of Sion: he hath stretched out his line, and hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying: and the bulwark hath mourned, and the wall hath been destroyed to- gether.
<br>9	Teth.   Her gates are sunk into the ground: he hath destroyed, and broken her bars: her king and her princes are among the Gentiles: the law is no more, and her prophets have found no vi- sion from the Lord.
<br>10	Jod.	The ancients of the daughter of Sion sit upon the ground, they have held their peace: they have sprinkled their heads with dust, they are girdcd with haircloth, the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground. 11 Caph. My eyes have failed with weeping, my bowels are troubled: my liver is poured out upon the earth, for the destruction of the daugh- ter of my people, when the children, and the sucklings, fainted away in the streets of the city. 12 Lamed. They said to their mothers: Where
<br>is corn and wine? when they fainted away as the wounded in the streets of the city: when they breathed out their souls in the bosoms of their mothers.
<br>13	Mem. To what shall I compare thee? or to what shall I liken thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? to what shall I equal thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Sion? for great as the sea is thy destruction: who shall heal thee?
<br>14	Nun. Thy prophets have seen false and foolish things for thee: and they have not laid open thy iniquity, to excite thee to penance: but they have seen for thee false revelations and ban- ishments.
<br>15	Samech. All they that passed by the way
<br> 
<br>have clapped their hands at thee: they have hissed, and wagged their heads at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying: Is this the city of perfect beauty, the joy of all the earth?
<br>16	Phe. All thy enemies have opened their month against thee: they have hissed, and gnashed with the teeth, and have said: We will swallow her up: lo, this is the day which we looked for: we have found it, we have seen it.
<br>17	Ain. The Lord hath done that which he purposed, he hath fulfilled his word, which he commanded in the days of old: he hath de- stroyed, and hath not spared, and he hath caused the enemy to rejoice over thee, and hath set up the horn of thy adversaries.
<br>18	Sade. Their heart cried to the Lord upon the walls of the daughter of Sion: Let tears run down like a torrent day and night: give thyself no rest, and let not the apple of thy eye cease.
<br>19	Coph. Arise, give praise in the night, in the beginning of the watches: pour out thy heart like water, before the face of the Lord: lift up thy hands to him for the life of thy little children, that have fainted for hunger at the top of all the streets.
<br>20	Res. Behold, O Lord, and consider whom thou hast thus dealt with: shall women then eat their own fruit, their children of a span long? shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?
<br>21	Sin. The child and the old man lie without on the ground: my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword: thou hast slain them in the day of thy wrath: thou hast killed, and shewn them no pity.
<br>22	Thau. Thou hast called as to a festival, those that should terrify me round about, and there was none in the day of the wrath of the Lord that escaped and was left: those that I brought up, and nourished, my enemy hath con-
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>sumed them.
<br>
<br>Chapter 3
<br>Aleph. I am the man that see my poverty by the rod of his indignation.
<br>2	Aleph. He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, and not into light.
<br>3	Aleph. Only against me he hath turned, and turned again his hand all the day.
<br>4	Beth. My skin and my flesh he hath made old, he hath broken my bones.
<br>5	Beth. He hath built round about me, and he hath compassed me with gall, and labour.
<br>6	Beth. He hath set me in dark places as those that are dead for ever.
<br>7	Ghimel. He hath built against me round about, that I may not get out: he hath made my fetters heavy.
<br>8	Ghimel. Yea, and when I cry, and entreat, he hath shut out my prayer.
<br>9	Ghimel. He hath shut up my ways with square stones, he hath turned my paths upside down.
<br>10	Daleth. He is become to me as a bear lying in wait: as a lion in secret places.
<br>11	Daleth. He hath turned aside my paths, and hath broken me in pieces, he hath made me desolate.
<br>12	Daleth. He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for his arrows.
<br>13	He. He hath shot into my reins the daugh- ters of his quiver.
<br>14	He. I am made a derision to all my people, their song all the day long.
<br>15	He. He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath inebriated me with wormwood.
<br>16	Vau. And he hath broken my teeth one by one, he hath fed me with ashes.
<br> 
<br>17	Vau. And my soul is removed far off from peace, I have forgotten good things.
<br>18	Vau. And I said: My end and my hope is perished from the Lord.
<br>19	Zain. Remember my poverty, and trans- gression, the wormwood and the gall.
<br>20	Zain. I will be mindful and remember, and my soul shall languish within me.
<br>21	Zain. These things I shall think over in my heart, therefore will I hope.
<br>22	Heth. The mercies of the Lord that we are not consumed: because his commiserations have not failed.
<br>23	Heth. They are new every morning, great is thy faithfulness.
<br>24	Heth. The Lord is my portion, said my soul: therefore will I wait for him.
<br>25	Teth. The Lord is good to them that hope in him, to the soul that seeketh him.
<br>26	Teth. It is good to wait with silence for the salvation of God.
<br>27	Teth. It is good for a man, when he hath borne the yoke from his youth.
<br>28	Jod. He shall sit solitary, and hold his peace: because he hath taken it up upon him- self.
<br>29	Jod. He shall put his mouth in the dust, if so be there may be hope.
<br>30	Jod. He shall give his cheek to him that striketh him, he shall be filled with reproaches.
<br>31	Caph. For the Lord will not cast off for ever.
<br>32	Caph. For if he hath cast off, he will also have mercy, according to the multitude of his mercies.
<br>33	Caph. For he hath not willingly afflicted, nor cast off the children of men.
<br>34	Lamed. To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the land,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>35	Lamed. To turn aside the judgment of a man before the face of the most High,
<br>36	Lamed.   To destroy a man wrongfully in his judgment, the Lord hath not approved.
<br>37	Mem. Who is he that hath commanded a thing to be done, when the Lord commandeth it not?
<br>38	Mem. Shall not both evil and good proceed out of the mouth of the Highest?
<br>39	Mem. Why hath a living man murmured, man suffering for his sins?
<br>40	Nun. Let us search our ways, and seek, and return to the Lord.
<br>41	Nun. Let us lift up our hearts with our hands to the Lord in the heavens.
<br>42	Nun. We have done wickedly, and provoked thee to wrath: therefore thou art inexorable.
<br>43	Samech. Thou hast covered in thy wrath, and hast struck us: thou hast killed and hast not spared.
<br>44	Samech. Thou hast set a cloud before thee, that our prayer may not pass through.
<br>45	Samech. Thou hast made me as an outcast, and refuse in the midst of the people.
<br>46	Phe. All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.
<br>47	Phe. Prophecy is become to us a fear, and a snare, and destruction.
<br>48	Phe. My eye hath run down with streams of water, for the destruction of the daughter of my people.
<br>49	Ain. My eye is afflicted, and hath not been quiet, because there was no rest:
<br>50	Ain. Till the Lord regarded and looked down from the heavens.
<br>51	Ain. My eye hath wasted my soul because of all the daughters of my city.
<br>52	Sade. My enemies have chased me and caught me like a bird, without cause.
<br> 
<br>53	Sade. My life is fallen into the pit, and they have laid a stone over me.
<br>54	Sade. Waters have flowed over my head: I said: I am cut off.
<br>55	Coph. I have called upon thy name, O Lord, from the lowest pit.
<br>56	Coph. Thou hast heard my voice: turn not away thy ear from my sighs, and cries.
<br>57	Coph. Thou drewest near in the day, when I called upon thee, thou saidst: Fear not.
<br>58	Res. Thou hast judged, O Lord, the cause of my soul, thou the Redeemer of my life.
<br>59	Res. Thou hast seen, O Lord, their iniquity against me: judge thou my judgment.
<br>60	Res. Thou hast seen all their fury, and all their thoughts against me.
<br>61	Sin. Thou hast heard their reproach, O Lord, all their imaginations against me.
<br>62	Sin. The lips of them that rise up against me: and their devices against me all the day.
<br>63	Sin. Behold their sitting down, and their rising up, I am their song.
<br>64	Thau. Thou shalt render them a recom- pense, O Lord, according to the works of their hands.
<br>65	Thau. Thou shalt give them a buckler of heart, thy labour.
<br>66	Thau. Thou shalt persecute them in anger, and shalt destroy them from under the heavens, O Lord.
<br>
<br>Chapter 4
<br>
<br>Aleph. How is the gold become dim, the finest colour is changed, the stones of the sanctuary are scattered in the top of every street?
<br>2	Beth. The noble sons of Sion, and they that were clothed with the best gold: how are they
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>esteemed as earthen vessels, the work of the pot- ter’s hands?
<br>3	Ghimel. Even the sea monsters have drawn out the breast, they have given suck to their young: the daughter of my people is cruel, like the ostrich in the desert.
<br>4	Daleth. The tongue of the sucking child hath stuck to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the little ones have asked for bread, and there was none to break it unto them.
<br>5	He. They that were fed delicately have died in the streets: they that were brought up in scar- let have embraced the dung.
<br>6	Vau. And the iniquity of the daughter of my people is made greater than the sin of Sodom, which was overthrown in a moment, and hands took nothing in her.
<br>7	Zain. Her Nazarites were whiter than snow, purer than milk, more ruddy than the old ivory, fairer than the sapphire.
<br>8	Heth. Their face is now made blacker than coals, and they are not known in the streets: their skin hath stuck to their bones, it is with- ered, and is become like wood.
<br>9	Teth. It was better with them that were slain by the sword, than with them that died with hunger: for these pined away being con- sumed for want of the fruits of the earth.
<br>10	Jod. The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children: they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people. 11   Caph.	The Lord hath accomplished his wrath, he hath poured out his fierce anger: and he hath kindled a fire in Sion, and it hath de-
<br>voured the foundations thereof.
<br>12	Lamed. The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world would not have believed, that the adversary and the enemy should enter in by the gates of Jerusalem.
<br>13	Mem. For the sins of her prophets, and
<br> 
<br>the iniquities of her priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her.
<br>14	Nun. They have wandered as blind men in the streets, they were defiled with blood: and when they could not help walking in it, they held up their skirts.
<br>15	Samech. Depart you that are defiled, they cried out to them: Depart, get ye hence, touch not: for they quarrelled, and being removed, they said among the Gentiles: He will no more dwell among them.
<br>16	Phe. The face of the Lord hath divided them, he will no more regard them: they re- spected not the persons of the priests, neither had they pity on the ancient.
<br>17	Ain. While we were yet standing, our eyes failed, expecting help for us in vain, when we looked attentively towards a nation that was not able to save.
<br>18	Sade. Our steps have slipped in the way of our streets, our end draweth near: our days are fulfilled, for our end is come.
<br>19	Coph. Our persecutors were swifter than the eagles of the air: they pursued us upon the mountains, they lay in wait for us in the wilder- ness.
<br>20	Res. The breath of our mouth, Christ the Lord, is taken in our sins: to whom we said: Un- der thy shadow we shall live among the Gentiles.
<br>22 Thau. Thy iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Sion, he will no more carry thee away into captivity: he hath visited thy iniquity, O daughter of Edom, he hath discovered thy sins.
<br>
<br>Chapter 5
<br>
<br>Remember, O Lord, what is come upon us: con- sider and behold our reproach.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>2	Our inheritance is turned to aliens: our houses to strangers.
<br>3	We are become orphans without a father: our mothers are as widows.
<br>4	We have drunk our water for money: we have bought our wood.
<br>6 We were dragged by the necks, we were weary and no rest was given us.
<br>6	We have given our hand to Egypt,  and to the Assyrians, that we might be satisfied with bread.
<br>7	Our fathers have sinned, and are not: and we have borne their iniquities.
<br>8	Servants have ruled over us: there was none to redeem us out of their hand.
<br>9	We fetched our bread at the peril of our lives, because of the sword in the desert.
<br>10	Our skin was burnt as an oven, by reason of the violence of the famine.
<br>11	They oppressed the women in Sion, and the virgins in the cities of Juda.
<br>12	The princes were hanged up by their hand: they did not respect the persons of the ancients. 13 They abused the young men indecently:
<br>and the children fell under the wood.
<br>14	The ancients have ceased from the gates: the young men from the choir of the singers.
<br>15	The joy of our heart is ceased, our dancing is turned into mourning.
<br>16	The crown is fallen from our head: woe to us, because we have sinned.
<br>17	Therefore is our heart sorrowful, therefore are our eyes become dim.
<br>18	For mount Sion, because it is destroyed, foxes have walked upon it.
<br>19	But thou, O Lord, shalt remain  for ever, thy throne from generation to generation.
<br>20	Why wilt thou forget us for ever? why wilt thou forsake us for a long time?
<br> 
<br>21	Convert us, O Lord, to thee, and we shall be converted: renew our days, as from the be- ginning.
<br>22	But thou hast utterly rejected us, thou art exceedingly angry with us.

<br>
<br>Prophecy of Baruch
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>
<br>And these are the words of the book, which Baruch the son of Nerias, the son of Maasias, the son of Sedecias, the son of Sedei, the son Helcias, wrote in Babylonia.
<br>2	In the fifth year, in the seventh day of the month, at the time that the Chaldeans took Jerusalem, and burnt it with fire.
<br>3	And Baruch read the words of this book in the hearing of Jechonias the son of Joakim king of Juda, and in the hearing of all the people that came to hear the book.
<br>4	And in the hearing of the nobles, the sons of the kings, and in the hearing of the ancients, and in the hearing of the people, from the least even to the greatest of them that dwelt in Babylonia, by the river Sedi.
<br>5	And when they heard it they wept, and fasted, and prayed before the Lord.
<br>6	And they made a collection of money ac- cording to every man’s power.
<br>7	And they sent it to Jerusalem to Joakim the priest, the son of Helcias, the son of Salom, and to the priests, and to all the people, that were found with him in Jerusalem:
<br>8	At the time when he received the vessels of the temple of the Lord, which had been taken away out of the temple, to return them into the land of Juda the tenth day of the month Sivan, the silver vessels, which Sedecias the son
<br> 
<br>of Josias king of Juda had made,
<br>9	After that Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon had carried away Jechonias, and the princes, and all the powerful men, and the people of the land from Jerusalem, and brought them bound to Babylon.
<br>10	And they said: Behold we have sent you money, buy with it holocausts, and frankincense, and make meat offerings, and offerings for sin at the altar of the Lord our God:
<br>11	And pray ye for the life of Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon, and for the life of Balthasar his son, that their days may be upon earth as the days of heaven:
<br>12	And that the Lord may give us strength, and enlighten our eyes, that we may live under the shadow of Nabuchodonosor the king of Baby- lon, and under the shadow of Balthasar his son, and may serve them many days, and may find favour in their sight.
<br>13	And pray ye for us to the Lord our God: for we have sinned against the Lord our God, and his wrath is not turned away from us even to this day.
<br>14	And read ye this book, which we have sent to you to be read in the temple of the Lord, on feasts, and proper days.
<br>15	And you shall say: To the Lord our God belongeth justice, but to us confusion of our face: as it is come to pass at this day to all Juda, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>16	To our kings, and to our princes, and to our priests, and to our prophets, and to our fathers. 17 We have sinned before the Lord our God, and have not believed him, nor put our trust in
<br>him:
<br>18	And we were not obedient to him, and we have not hearkened to the voice of the Lord our God, to walk in his commandments which he hath given us.
<br>19	From the day that he brought our fathers out of the land of Egypt, even to this day, we were disobedient to the Lord our God: and going astray we turned away from hearing his voice.
<br>20	And many evils have cleaved to us, and the curses which the Lord foretold by Moses his servant: who brought our fathers out of the land of Egypt, to give us a land flowing with milk and honey, as at this day.
<br>21	And we have not hearkened to the voice of the Lord our God according to all the words of the prophets whom he sent to us:
<br>22	And we have gone away every man after the inclinations of his own wicked heart, to serve strange gods, and to do evil in the sight of the Lord our God.
<br>
<br>Chapter 2
<br>Wherefore the Lord our God hath made good his word, that he spoke to us, and to our judges that have judged Israel, and to our kings, and to our princes, and to all Israel and Juda:
<br>2 That the Lord would bring upon us great evils, such as never happened under heaven, as they have come to pass in Jerusalem, according to the things that are written in the law of Moses: 3 That a man should eat the flesh of his own
<br>son, and the flesh of his own daughter.
<br>4 And he hath delivered them up to be under
<br> 
<br>the hand of all the kings that are round about us, to be a reproach, and desolation among all the people, among whom the Lord hath scattered us. 5 And we are brought under, and are not up- permost: because we have sinned against the
<br>Lord our God, by not obeying his voice.
<br>6	To the Lord our God belongeth justice: but to us, and to our fathers confusion of face, as at this day.
<br>7	For the Lord hath pronounced against us all these evils that are come upon us:
<br>8	And we have not entreated the face of the Lord our God, that we might return every one of us from our most wicked ways.
<br>9	And the Lord hath watched over us for evil, and hath brought it upon us: for the Lord is just in all his works which he hath commanded us:
<br>10	And we have not hearkened to his voice to walk in the commandments of the Lord which he hath set before us.
<br>11	And now, O Lord God of Israel, who hast brought thy people out of the land of Egypt with a strong hand, and with signs, and with wonders, and with thy great power, and with a mighty arm, and hast made thee a name as at this day, 12 We have sinned, we have done wickedly, we have acted unjustly, O Lord our God, against all
<br>thy justices.
<br>13	Let thy wrath be turned away from us: for we are left a few among the nations where thou hast scattered us.
<br>14	Hear, O Lord, our prayers, and our peti- tions, and deliver us for thy own sake: and grant that we may find favour in the sight of them that have led us away:
<br>15	That all the earth may know that thou art the Lord our God, and that thy name is called upon Israel, and upon his posterity.
<br>16	Look down upon us, O Lord, from thy holy house, and incline thy ear, and hear us.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>17	Open thy eyes, and behold: for the dead that are in hell, whose spirit is taken away from their bowels, shall not give glory and justice to the Lord:
<br>18	But the soul that is sorrowful for the great- ness of evil she hath done, and goeth bowed down, and feeble, and the eyes that fail, and the hungry soul giveth glory and justice to thee the Lord.
<br>19	For it is not for the justices of our fathers that we pour out our prayers, and beg mercy in thy sight, O Lord our God:
<br>20	But because thou hast sent out thy wrath, and thy indignation upon us, as thou hast spoken by the hand of thy servants the prophets, saying: 21 Thus saith the Lord: Bow down your shoul- der, and your neck, and serve the king of Baby- lon: and you shall remain in the land which I
<br>have given to your fathers.
<br>22	But if you will not hearken to the voice of the Lord your God, to serve the king of Babylon: I will cause you to depart out of the cities of Juda, and from without Jerusalem.
<br>23	And I will take away from you the voice of mirth, and the voice of joy, and the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, and all the land shall be without any footstep of inhab- itants.
<br>24	And they hearkened not to thy voice, to serve the king of Babylon: and thou hast made good thy words, which thou spokest by the hands of thy servants the prophets, that the bones of our kings, and the bones of our fathers should be removed out of their place:
<br>25	And behold they are cast out to the heat of the sun, and to the frost of the night: and they have died in grievous pains, by famine, and by the sword, and in banishment.
<br>26	And thou hast made the temple, in which thy name was called upon, as it is at this day, for
<br> 
<br>the iniquity of the house of Israel, and the house of Juda.
<br>27	And thou hast dealt with us, O Lord our God, according to all thy goodness, and accord- ing to all that great mercy of thine:
<br>28	As thou spokest by the hand of thy servant Moses, in the day when thou didst command him to write thy law before the children of Israel,
<br>29	Saying: If you will not hear my voice, this great multitude shall be turned into a very small number among the nations, where I will scatter them:
<br>30	For I know that the people will not hear me, for they are a people of a stiff neck: but they shall turn to their heart in the land of their captivity:
<br>31	And they shall know that I am the Lord their God: and I will give them a heart, and they shall understand: and ears, and they shall hear.
<br>32	And they shall praise me in the land of their captivity, and shall be mindful of my name.
<br>33	And they shall turn away themselves from their stiff neck, and from their wicked deeds: for they shall remember the way of their fathers, that sinned against me.
<br>34	And I will bring them back again into the land which I promised with an oath to their fa- thers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and they shall be masters thereof: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be diminished.
<br>35	And I will make with them another covenant that shall be everlasting, to be their God, and they shall be my people: and I will no more remove my people, the children of Israel, out of the land that I have given them.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 3
<br>And now, O Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, the soul in anguish, and the troubled spirit crieth to thee:
<br>2	Hear, O Lord, and have mercy, for thou art a merciful God, and have pity on us: for we have sinned before thee.
<br>3	For thou remainest for ever, and shall we perish everlastingly?
<br>4	O Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, hear now the prayer of the dead of Israel, and of their children, that have sinned before thee, and have not hearkened to the voice of the Lord their God, wherefore evils have cleaved fast to us.
<br>5	Remember not the iniquities of our fathers, but think upon thy hand, and upon thy name at this time:
<br>6	For thou art the Lord our God, and we will praise thee, O Lord:
<br>7	Because for this end thou hast put thy fear in our hearts, to the intent that we should call upon thy name, and praise thee in our captivity, for we are converted from the iniquity of our fathers, who sinned before thee.
<br>8	And behold we are at this day in our cap- tivity, whereby thou hast scattered us to be a reproach, and a curse, and an offence, according to all the iniquities of our fathers, who departed from thee, O Lord our God.
<br>9	Hear, O Israel, the commandments of life: give ear, that thou mayst learn wisdom.
<br>10	How happeneth it, O Israel, that thou art in thy enemies’ land?
<br>11	Thou art grown old in a strange country, thou art defiled with the dead: thou art counted with them that go down into hell.
<br>12	Thou hast forsaken the fountain of wisdom:
<br>13	For if thou hadst walked in the way of God, thou hadst surely dwelt in peace for ever.
<br> 
<br>14	Learn where is wisdom, where is strength, where is understanding: that thou mayst know also where is length of days and life, where is the light of the eyes, and peace.
<br>15	Who hath found out her place? and who hath gone in to her treasures?
<br>16	Where are the princes of the nations, and they that rule over the beasts that are upon the earth?
<br>17	That take their diversion with the birds of the air.
<br>18	That hoard up silver and gold, wherein men trust, and there is no end of their getting? who work in silver and are solicitous, and their works are unsearchable.
<br>19	They are cut off, and are gone down to hell, and others are risen up in their place.
<br>20	Young men have seen the light, and dwelt upon the earth: but the way of knowledge they have not known,
<br>21	Nor have they understood the paths thereof, neither have their children received it, it is far from their face.
<br>22	It hath not been heard of in the land of Chanaan, neither hath it been seen in Theman. 23 The children of Agar also, that search after the wisdom that is of the earth, the merchants of Merrha, and of Theman, and the tellers of fa- bles, and searchers of prudence and understand- ing: but the way of wisdom they have not known,
<br>neither have they remembered her paths.
<br>24	O Israel, how great is the house of God, and how vast is the place of his possession!
<br>25	It is great, and hath no end: it is high and immense.
<br>26	There were the giants, those renowned men that were from the beginning, of great stature, expert in war.
<br>27	The Lord chose not them, neither did they find the way of knowledge: therefore did they
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>perish.
<br>28	And because they had not wisdom, they perished through their folly.
<br>29	Who hath gone up into heaven, and taken her, and brought her down from the clouds?
<br>30	Who hath passed over the sea, and found her, and brought her preferably to chosen gold? 31 There is none that is able to know her ways,
<br>nor that can search out her paths:
<br>32	But he that knoweth all things, knoweth her, and hath found her out with his understand- ing: he that prepared the earth for evermore, and filled it with cattle and fourfooted beasts:
<br>33	He that sendeth forth the light, and it goeth: and hath called it, and it obeyeth him with trembling.
<br>34	And the stars have given light in their watches, and rejoiced:
<br>35	They were called, and they said: Here we are: and with cheerfulness they have shined forth to him that made them.
<br>36	This is our God, and there shall no other be accounted of in comparison of him.
<br>37	He found out all the way of knowledge, and gave it to Jacob his servant, and to Israel his beloved.
<br>38	Afterwards he was seen upon earth, and conversed with men.
<br>
<br>Chapter 4
<br>
<br>This is the book of the commandments of God, and the law, that is for ever: all they that keep it, shall come to life: but they that have forsaken it, to death.
<br>2	Return, O Jacob, and take hold of it, walk in the way by its brightness, in the presence of the light thereof.
<br> 
<br>3	Give not thy honour to another, nor thy dignity to a strange nation.
<br>4	We are happy, O Israel: because the things that are pleasing to God, are made known to us. 5 Be of good comfort, O people of God, the
<br>memorial of Israel:
<br>6 You have been sold to the Gentiles, not for your destruction: but because you provoked God to wrath, you are delivered to your adversaries. 7 For you have provoked him who made you, the eternal God, offering sacrifice to devils, and
<br>not to God.
<br>8	For you have forgotten God, who brought you up, and you have grieved Jerusalem that nursed you.
<br>9	For she saw the wrath of God coming upon you, and she said: Give ear, all you that dwell near Sion, for God hath brought upon me great mourning:
<br>10	For I have seen the captivity of my people, of my sons, and my daughters, which the Eternal hath brought upon them.
<br>11	For I nourished them with joy: but I sent them away with weeping and mourning.
<br>12	Let no man rejoice over me, a widow, and desolate: I am forsaken of many for the sins of my children, because they departed from the law of God.
<br>13	And they have not known his justices, nor walked by the ways of God’s commandments, neither have they entered by the paths of his truth and justice.
<br>14	Let them that dwell about Sion come, and remember the captivity of my sons and daugh- ters, which the Eternal hath brought upon them. 15 For he hath brought a nation upon them from afar, a wicked nation, and of a strange
<br>tongue:
<br>16 Who have neither reverenced the ancient, nor pitied children, and have carried away the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>beloved of the widow, and have left me all alone without children.
<br>17	But as for me, what help can I give you?
<br>18	But he that hath brought the evils upon you, he will deliver you out of the hands of your enemies.
<br>19	Go your way, my children, go your way: for I am left alone.
<br>20	I have put off the robe of peace, and have put upon me the sackcloth of supplication, and I will cry to the most High in my days.
<br>21	Be of good comfort, my children, cry to the Lord, and he will deliver you out of the hand of the princes your enemies.
<br>22	For my hope is in the Eternal that he will save you: and joy is come upon me from the Holy One, because of the mercy which shall come to you from our everlasting Saviour.
<br>23	For I sent you forth with mourning and weeping: but the Lord will bring you back to me with joy and gladness for ever.
<br>24	For as the neighbours of Sion have now seen your captivity from God: so shall they also shortly see your salvation from God, which shall come upon you with great honour, and everlast- ing glory.
<br>25	My children, suffer patiently the wrath that is come upon you: for thy enemy hath per- secuted thee, but thou shalt quickly see his de- struction: and thou shalt get up upon his neck. 26 My delicate ones have walked rough ways, for they were taken away as a flock made a prey
<br>by the enemies.
<br>27	Be of good comfort, my children, and cry to the Lord: for you shall be remembered by him that hath led you away.
<br>28	For as it was your mind to go astray from God; so when you return again you shall seek him ten times as much.
<br> 
<br>29	For he that hath brought evils upon you, shall bring you everlasting joy again with your salvation.
<br>30	Be of good heart, O Jerusalem: for he ex- horteth thee, that named thee.
<br>31	The wicked that have afflicted thee, shall perish: and they that have rejoiced at thy ruin, shall be punished.
<br>32	The cities which thy children have served, shall be punished: and she that received thy sons.
<br>33	For as she rejoiced at thy ruin, and was glad of thy fall: so shall she be grieved for her own desolation.
<br>34	And the joy of her multitude shall be cut off: and her gladness shall be turned to mourn- ing.
<br>35	For fire shall come upon her from the Eter- nal, long to endure, and she shall be inhabited by devils for a great time.
<br>36	Look about thee, O Jerusalem, towards the east, and behold the joy that cometh to thee from God.
<br>37	For behold thy children come, whom thou sentest away scattered, they come gathered to- gether from the east even to the west, at the word of the Holy One rejoicing for the honour of God.
<br>
<br>Chapter 5
<br>
<br>Put off, O Jerusalem, the garment of thy mourn- ing, and affliction: and put on the beauty, and honour of that everlasting glory which thou hast from God.
<br>2	God will clothe thee with the double gar- ment of justice, and will set a crown on thy head of everlasting honour.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>3	For God will shew his brightness in thee, to every one under heaven.
<br>4	For thy name shall be named to thee by God for ever: the peace of justice, and honour of piety.
<br>5	Arise, O Jerusalem, and stand on high: and look about towards the east, and behold thy chil- dren gathered together from the rising to the set- ting sun, by the word of the Holy One rejoicing in the remembrance of God.
<br>6	For they went out from thee on foot, led by the enemies: but the Lord will bring them to thee exalted with honour as children of the kingdom.
<br>7	For God hath appointed to bring down every high mountain, and the everlasting rocks, and to fill up the valleys to make them even with the ground: that Israel may walk diligently to the honour of God.
<br>8	Moreover the woods, and every sweet- smelling tree have overshadowed Israel by the commandment of God.
<br>9	For God will bring Israel with joy in the light of his majesty, with mercy, and justice, that cometh from him.
<br>
<br>Chapter 6
<br>For the sins that you have committed before God, you shall be carried away captives into Babylon by Nabuchodonosor the king of Baby- lon.
<br>2	And when you are come into Babylon, you shall be there many years, and for a long time, even to seven generations: and after that I will bring you away from thence with peace.
<br>3	But now, you shall see in Babylon gods of gold, and of silver, and of stone, and of wood borne upon shoulders, causing fear to the Gen-
<br> 
<br>tiles.
<br>4	Beware therefore that you imitate not the doings of others, and be afraid, and the fear of them should seize upon you.
<br>5	But when you see the multitude behind, and before, adoring them, say you in your hearts: Thou oughtest to be adored, O Lord.
<br>6	For my angel is with you: And I myself will demand an account of your souls.
<br>7	For their tongue that is polished by the craftsman, and themselves laid over with gold and silver, are false things, and they cannot speak.
<br>8	And as if it were for a maiden that loveth to go gay: so do they take gold and make them up. 9 Their gods have golden crowns upon their heads: whereof the priests secretly convey away from them gold, and silver, and bestow it on
<br>themselves.
<br>10	Yea and they give thereof to prostitutes, and they dress out harlots: and again when they receive it of the harlots, they adorn their gods.
<br>11	And these gods cannot defend themselves from the rust, and the moth.
<br>12	But when they have covered them with a purple garment, they wipe their face because of the dust of the house, which is very much among them.
<br>13	This holdeth a sceptre as a man, as a judge of the country, but cannot put to death one that offendeth him.
<br>14	And this hath in his hand a sword, or an axe, but cannot save himself from war, or from robbers, whereby be it known to you, that they are not gods.
<br>15	Therefore fear them not. For as a vessel that a man uses when it is broken becometh use- less, even so are their gods:
<br>16	When they are placed in the house, their eyes are full of dust by the feet of them that go
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>in.
<br>17	And as the gates are made sure on every side upon one that hath offended the king, or like a dead man carried to the grave, so do the priests secure the doors with bars and locks, lest they be stripped by thieves.
<br>18	They light candles to them, and in great number, of which they cannot see one: but they are like beams in the house.
<br>19	And they say that the creeping things which are of the earth, gnaw their hearts, while they eat them and their garments, and they feel it not.
<br>20	Their faces are black with the smoke that is made in the house.
<br>21	Owls, and swallows, and other birds fly upon their bodies, and upon their heads, and cats in like manner.
<br>22	Whereby you may know that they are no gods. Therefore fear them not.
<br>23	The gold also which they have, is for shew, but except a man wipe off the rust, they will not shine: for neither when they were molten, did they feel it.
<br>24	Men buy them at a high price, whereas there is no breath in them.
<br>25	And having not the use of feet they are car- ried upon shoulders, declaring to men how vile they are. Be they confounded also that worship them.
<br>26	Therefore if they fall to the ground, they rise not up again of themselves, nor if a man set them upright, will they stand by themselves, but their gifts shall be set before them, as to the dead.
<br>27	The things that are sacrificed to them, their priests sell and abuse: in like manner also their wives take part of them, but give nothing of it either to the sick, or to the poor.
<br>28	The childbearing and menstruous women
<br> 
<br>touch their sacrifices: knowing, therefore, by these things that they are not gods, fear them not.
<br>29	For how can they be called gods? because women set offerings before the gods of silver, and of gold, and of wood:
<br>30	And priests sit in their temples, having their garments rent, and their heads and beards shaven, and nothing upon their heads.
<br>31	And they roar and cry before their gods, as men do at the feast when one is dead.
<br>32	The priests take away their garments, and clothe their wives and their children.
<br>33	And whether it be evil that one doth unto them, or good, they are not able to recompense it: neither can they set up a king, nor put him down:
<br>34	In like manner they can neither give riches, nor requite evil. If a man make a vow to them, and perform it not: they cannot require it.
<br>35	They cannot deliver a man from death, nor save the weak from the mighty.
<br>36	They cannot restore the blind man to his sight: nor deliver a man from distress.
<br>7 They shall not pity the widow, nor do good to the fatherless.
<br>38	Their gods, of wood, and of stone, and of gold, and of silver, are like the stones that are hewn out of the mountains: and they that wor- ship them shall be confounded.
<br>39	How then is it to be supposed, or to be said, that they are gods?
<br>40	Even the Chaldeans themselves dishonor them: who when they here of one dumb that cannot speak, they present him to Bel, entreat- ing him, that he may speak.
<br>41	As though they could be sensible that have no motion themselves: and they, when they shall perceive this, will leave them: for their gods themselves have no sense.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>42	The women also, with cords about them, sit in the ways, burning olive-stones.
<br>43	And when any one of them, drawn away by some passenger, lieth with him, she upbraideth her neighbor, that she was not thought as worthy as herself, nor her cord broken.
<br>44	But all things that are done about them, are false: how is it then to be thought, or to be said, that they are gods?
<br>45	And they are made by workmen, and by goldsmiths. They shall be nothing else but what the priests will have them to be.
<br>46	For the artificers themselves that make them, are of no long continuance. Can those things then that are made by them, be gods?
<br>47	But they have left false things and reproach to them that come after.
<br>48	For when war cometh upon them , or evils: the priests consult with themselves, where they may hide themselves with them.
<br>49	How then can they be thought to be gods, that can neither deliver themselves from war, nor save themselves from evils?
<br>50	For seeing they are but of wood, and laid over with gold, and with silver, it shall be known hereafter that they are false things, by all na- tions, and kings: and it shall be manifest that they are no gods, but the work of men’s hands, and that there is no work of God in them.
<br>51	Whence, therefore, is it known that they are not gods, but the work of men’s hands, and no work of God is in them?
<br>52	They cannot set up a king over the land, nor give rain to men.
<br>53	They determine no causes, nor deliver countries from oppression: because they can do nothing, and are as daws between heaven and earth.
<br>54	For when fire shall fall upon the house of these gods of wood, and of silver, and of gold,
<br> 
<br>their priests indeed will flee away, and be saved: but they themselves shall be burnt in the midst like beams.
<br>55	And they cannot withstand a king and war. How then can it be supposed, or admitted, that they are gods?
<br>56	Neither are these gods of wood, and of stone, and laid over with gold, and with silver, able to deliver themselves from thieves or rob- bers: they that are stronger than them,
<br>57	Shall take from them the gold, and silver, and the raiment wherewith they are clothed, and shall go their way, neither shall they help them- selves.
<br>58	Therefore it is better to be a king that sheweth his power: or else a profitable vessel in the house, with which the owner thereof will be well satisfied: or a door in the house, to keep things safe that are therein, than such false gods. 59 The sun, and the moon, and the stars be- ing bright, and sent forth for profitable uses, are
<br>obedient.
<br>60 In like manner the lightning, when it breaketh forth, is easy to be seen: and after the same manner the wind bloweth in every country. 61 And the clouds, when God commandeth them to go over the whole world, do that which
<br>is commanded them.
<br>62	The fire also being sent from above to consume mountains, and woods, doth as it is commanded. But these neither in shew, nor in power, are alike to any one of them.
<br>63	Wherefore it is neither to be thought, nor to be said, that they are gods: since they are neither able to judge causes, nor to do any good to men.
<br>64	Knowing, therefore, that they are not gods, fear them not.
<br>65	For neither can they curse kings, nor bless them.
<br> 
<br>
<br>66	Neither do they shew signs in the heaven to the nations, nor shine as the sun, nor give light as the moon.
<br>67	Beasts are better than they, which can fly under a covert, and help themselves.
<br>68	Therefore there is no manner of appearance that they are gods: so fear them not.
<br>69	For as a scarecrow in a garden of cucumbers keepeth nothing, so are their gods of wood, and of silver, and laid over with gold.
<br>70	They are no better than a white thorn in a garden, upon which every bird sitteth. In like manner also their gods of wood, and laid over with gold, and with silver, are like to a dead body cast forth in the dark.
<br>71	By the purple also and the scarlet which are motheaten upon them, you shall know that they are not gods. And they themselves at last are consumed, and shall be a reproach in the country.
<br>72	Better, therefore, is the just man that hath no idols: for he shall be far from reproach.

<br>Prophecy of Ezechiel
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>
<br>Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, when I was in the midst of the captives by the river Chobar, the heavens were opened, and I saw the visions of God.
<br>2	On the fifth day of the month, the same was the fifth year of the captivity of king Joachin,
<br>3	The word of the Lord came to Ezechiel the priest the son of Buzi in the land of the Chaldeans, by the river Chobar: and the hand of the Lord was there upon him.
<br>4	And I saw, and behold a whirlwind came out of the north: and a great cloud, and a fire infolding it, and brightness was about it: and out of the midst thereof, that is, out of the midst of the fire, as it were the resemblance of amber:
<br>5	And in the midst thereof the likeness of four living creatures: and this was their appearance: there was the likeness of a man in them.
<br>6	Every one had four faces, and every one four wings.
<br>7	Their feet were straight feet, and the sole of their foot was like the sole of a calf’s foot, and they sparkled like the appearance of glowing brass.
<br>8	And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides: and they had faces, and wings on the four sides,
<br>9	And the wings of one were joined to the
<br> 
<br>wings of another. They turned not when they went: but every one went straight forward.
<br>10	And as for the likeness of their faces: there was the face of a man, and the face of a lion on the right side of all the four: and the face of an ox, on the left side of all the four: and the face of an eagle over all the four.
<br>11	And their faces, and their wings were stretched upward: two wings of every one were joined, and two covered their bodies:
<br>12	And every one of them went straight for- ward: whither the impulse of the spirit was to go, thither they went: and they turned not when they went.
<br>13	And as for the likeness of the living crea- tures, their appearance was like that of burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps. This was the vision running to and fro in the midst of the living creatures, a bright fire, and lightning going forth from the fire.
<br>14	And the living creatures ran and returned like flashes of lightning.
<br>15	Now as I beheld the living creatures, there appeared upon the earth by the living creatures one wheel with four faces.
<br>16	And the appearance of the wheels, and the work of them was like the appearance of the sea: and the four had all one likeness: and their ap- pearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the midst of a wheel.
<br>17	When they went, they went by their four
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>parts: and they turned not when they went.
<br>18	The wheels had also a size, and a height, and a dreadful appearance: and the whole body was full of eyes round about all the four.
<br>19	And, when the living creatures went, the wheels also went together by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels also were lifted up with them.
<br>20	Withersoever the spirit went, thither as the spirit went the wheels also were lifted up withal, and followed it: for the spirit of life was in the wheels.
<br>21	When those went these went, and when those stood these stood, and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up together, and followed them: for the spirit of life was in the wheels.
<br>22	And over the heads of the living creatures was the likeness of the firmament, the appear- ance of crystal terrible to behold, and stretched out over their heads above.
<br>23	And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other, every one with two wings covered his body, and the other was covered in like manner.
<br>24	And I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of many waters, as it were the voice of the most high God: when they walked, it was like the voice of a multitude, like the noise of an army, and when they stood, their wings were let down.
<br>25	For when a voice came from above the fir- mament, that was over their heads, they stood, and let down their wings.
<br>26	And above the firmament that was over their heads, was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of the sapphire stone, and upon the likeness of the throne, was the likeness of the appearance of a man above upon it.
<br>27	And I saw as it were the resemblance of
<br> 
<br>amber as the appearance of fire within it round about: from his loins and upward, and from his loins downward, I saw as it were the resemblance of fire shining round about.
<br>28	As the appearance of the rainbow when it is in a cloud on a rainy day: this was the appearance of the brightness round about.
<br>
<br>Chapter 2
<br>This was the vision of the likeness of the glory of the Lord, and I saw, and I fell upon my face, and I heard the voice of one that spoke, and he said to me: Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak to thee.
<br>2	And the spirit entered into me after that he spoke to me, and he set me upon my feet: and I heard him speaking to me,
<br>3	And saying: Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious people, that hath revolted from me, they, and their fathers, have transgressed my covenant even unto this day.
<br>4	And they to whom I send thee are children of a hard face, and of an obstinate heart: and thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord God:
<br>5	If so be they at least will hear, and if so be they will forbear, for they are a provoking house: and they shall know that there hath been a prophet in the midst of them.
<br>6	And thou, O son of man, fear not, neither be thou afraid of their words: for thou art among unbelievers and destroyers, and thou dwellest with scorpions.   Fear not their words, neither be thou dismayed at their looks: for they are a provoking house.
<br>7	And thou shalt speak my words to them, if perhaps they will hear, and forbear: for they provoke me to anger.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>8	But thou, O son of man, hear all that I say to thee: and do not thou provoke me, as that house provoketh me: open thy mouth, and eat what I give thee.
<br>9	And I looked, and behold, a hand was sent to me, wherein was a book rolled up: and he spread it before me, and it was written within and with- out: and there were written in it lamentations, and canticles, and woe.
<br>
<br>Chapter 3
<br>And he said to me: Son of man, eat all that thou shalt find: eat this book, and go speak to the children of Israel.
<br>2	And I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that book:
<br>3	And he said to me: Son of man, thy belly shall eat, and thy bowels shall be filled with this book, which I give thee, and I did eat it: and it was sweet as honey in my mouth.
<br>4	And he said to me: Son of man, go to the house of Israel, and thou shalt speak my words to them.
<br>5	For thou art not sent to a people of a pro- found speech, and of an unknown tongue, but to the house of Israel:
<br>6	Nor to many nations of a strange speech, and of an unknown tongue, whose words thou canst not understand: and if thou wert sent to them, they would hearken to thee.
<br>7	But the house of Israel will not hearken to thee: because they will not hearken to me: for all the house of Israel are of a hard forehead and an obstinate heart.
<br>8	Behold I have made thy face stronger than their faces: and thy forehead harder than their foreheads.
<br>9	I have made thy face like an adamant and
<br> 
<br>like flint: fear them not, neither be thou dis- mayed at their presence: for they are a provoking house.
<br>10	And he said to me: Son of man, receive in thy heart, and hear with thy ears, all the words that I speak to thee:
<br>11	And go get thee in to them of the captiv- ity, to the children of thy people, and thou shalt speak to them, and shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord: If so be they will hear, and will for- bear.
<br>12	And the spirit took me up, and I heard be- hind me the voice of a great commotion, saying: Blessed be the glory of the Lord, from his place. 13 The noise of the wings of the living crea- tures striking one against another, and the noise of the wheels following the living creatures, and
<br>the noise of a great commotion.
<br>14	The spirit also lifted me, and took me up: and I went away in bitterness in the indignation of my spirit: for the hand of the Lord was with me, strengthening me.
<br>15	And I came to them of the captivity, to the heap of new corn, to them that dwelt by the river Chobar, and I sat where they sat: and I remained there seven days mourning in the midst of them. 16 And at the end of seven days the word of
<br>the Lord came to me, saying:
<br>17	Son of man, I have made thee a watchman to the house of Israel: and thou shalt hear the word out of my mouth, and shalt tell it them from me.
<br>18	If, when I say to the wicked, Thou shalt surely die: thou declare it not to him, nor speak to him, that he may be converted from his wicked way, and live: the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but I will require his blood at thy hand.
<br>19	But if thou give warning to the wicked, and he be not converted from his wickedness,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>and from his evil way: he indeed shall die in his iniquity, but thou hast delivered thy soul.
<br>20	Moreover if the just man shall turn away from his justice, and shall commit iniquity: I will lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die, because thou hast not given him warning: he shall die in his sin, and his justices which he hath done, shall not be remembered: but I will require his blood at thy hand.
<br>21	But if thou warn the just man, that the just may not sin, and he doth not sin: living he shall live, because thou hast warned him, and thou hast delivered thy soul.
<br>22	And the hand of the Lord was upon me, and he said to me: Rise and go forth into the plain, and there I will speak to thee.
<br>23	And I rose up, and went forth into the plain: and behold the glory of the Lord stood there, like the glory which I saw by the river Chobar: and I fell upon my face.
<br>24	And the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet: and he spoke to me, and said to me: Go in; and shut thyself up in the midst of thy house.
<br>25	And thou, O son of man, behold they shall put bands upon thee, and they shall bind thee with them: and thou shalt not go forth from the midst of them.
<br>26	And I will make thy tongue stick fast to the roof of thy mouth, and thou shalt be dumb, and not as a man that reproveth: because they are a provoking house.
<br>27	But when I shall speak to thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: He that heareth, let him hear: and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a provoking house.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 4
<br>And thou, O son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee: and draw upon it the plan of the city of Jerusalem.
<br>2	And lay siege against it, and build forts, and cast up a mount, and set a camp against it, and place battering rams round about it.
<br>3	And take unto thee an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city: and set thy face resolutely against it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it: it is a sign to the house of Israel.
<br>4	And thou shalt sleep upon thy left side, and shalt lay the iniquities of the house of Israel upon it, according to the number of the days that thou shalt sleep upon it, and thou shalt take upon thee their iniquity.
<br>5	And I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days three hundred and ninety days: and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.
<br>6	And when thou hast accomplished this, thou shalt sleep again upon thy right side, and thou shalt take upon thee the iniquity of the house of Juda forty days:  a day for a year, yea, a day for a year I have appointed to thee.
<br>7	And thou shalt turn thy face to the siege of Jerusalem and thy arm shall be stretched out: and thou shalt prophesy against it.
<br>8	Behold I have encompassed thee with bands: and thou shalt not turn thyself from one side to the other, till thou hast ended the days of thy siege.
<br>9	And take to thee wheat and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and fitches, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread thereof according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side: three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>10	And thy meat that thou shalt eat, shall be in weight twenty staters a day: from time to time thou shalt eat it.
<br>11	And thou shalt drink water by measure, the sixth part of a hin: from time to time thou shalt drink it,
<br>12	And thou shalt eat it as barley bread baked under the ashes: and thou shalt cover it, in their sight, with the dung that cometh out of a man. 13 And the Lord said: So shall the children of Israel eat their bread all filthy among the nations
<br>whither I will cast them out.
<br>14	And I said: Ah, ah, ah, O Lord God, be- hold my soul hath not been defiled, and from my infancy even till now, I have not eaten any thing that died of itself, or was torn by beasts, and no unclean flesh hath entered into my mouth.
<br>15	And he said to me: Behold I have given thee neat’s dung for man’s dung, and thou shalt make thy bread therewith.
<br>16	And he said to me: Son of man: Be- hold, I will break in pieces the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care: and they shall drink water by measure, and in distress.
<br>17	So that when bread and water fail, every man may fall against his brother, and they may pine away in their iniquities.
<br>
<br>Chapter 5
<br>And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife that shaveth the hair: and cause it to pass over thy head, and over thy beard: and take thee a balance to weigh in, and divide the hair.
<br>2	A third part thou shalt burn with fire in the midst of the city, according to the fulfilling of the days of the siege: and thou shalt take a third part, and cut it in pieces with the knife
<br> 
<br>all round about: and the other third part thou shalt scatter in the wind, and I will draw out the sword after them.
<br>3	And thou shalt take thereof a small number: and shalt bind them in the skirt of thy cloak.
<br>4	And thou shalt take of them again, and shalt cast them in the midst of the fire, and shalt burn them with fire: and out of it shall come forth a fire into all the house of Israel.
<br>5	Thus saith the Lord God: This is Jerusalem, I have set her in the midst of the nations, and the countries round about her.
<br>6	And she hath despised my judgments, so as to be more wicked than the Gentiles; and my commandments, more than the countries that are round about her: for they have cast off my judgments, and have not walked in my com- mandments.
<br>7	Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Because you have surpassed the Gentiles that are round about you, and have not walked in my command- ments, and have not kept my judgments, and have not done according to the judgments of the nations that are round about you:
<br>8	Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Behold I come against thee, and I myself will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the Gentiles.
<br>9	And I will do in thee that which I have not done: and the like to which I will do no more, because of all thy abominations.
<br>10	Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers: and I will execute judgments in thee, and I will scatter thy whole remnant into every wind.
<br>11	Therefore as I live, saith the Lord God: Because thou hast violated my sanctuary with all thy offences, and with all thy abominations: I will also break thee in pieces, and my eye shall
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>not spare, and I will not have any pity.
<br>12	A third part of thee shall die with the pesti- lence, and shall be consumed with famine in the midst of thee: and a third part of thee shall fall by the sword round about thee: and a third part of thee will I scatter into every wind, and I will draw out a sword after them.
<br>13	And I will accomplish my fury, and will cause my indignation to rest upon them, and I will be comforted: and they shall know that I the Lord have spoken it in my zeal, when I shall have accomplished my indignation in them.
<br>14	And I will make thee desolate, and a re- proach among the nations that are round about thee, in the sight of every one that passeth by.
<br>15	And thou shalt be a reproach, and a scoff, an example, and an astonishment amongst the nations that are round about thee, when I shall have executed judgments in thee in anger, and in indignation, and in wrathful rebukes.
<br>16	I the Lord have spoken it: When I shall send upon them the grievous arrows of famine, which shall bring death, and which I will send to destroy you: and I will gather together famine against you: and I will break among you the staff of bread.
<br>17	And I will send in upon you famine, and evil beasts unto utter destruction: and pesti- lence, and blood shall pass through thee, and I will bring in the sword upon thee. I the Lord have spoken it.
<br>
<br>Chapter 6
<br>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
<br>2	Son of man set thy face towards the moun- tains of Israel, and prophesy against them.
<br>3	And say: Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord God: Thus saith the Lord
<br> 
<br>God to the mountains, and to the hills, and to the rocks, and the valleys: Behold, I will bring upon you the sword, and I will destroy your high places.
<br>4	And I will throw down your altars, and your idols shall be broken in pieces: and I will cast down your slain before your idols.
<br>5	And I will lay the dead carcasses of the chil- dren of Israel before your idols: and I will scatter your bones round about your altars,
<br>6	In all your dwelling places. The cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be thrown down, and destroyed, and your altars shall be abolished, and shall be broken in pieces: and your idols shall be no more, and your tem- ples shall be destroyed, and your works shall be defaced.
<br>7	And the slain shall fall in the midst of you: and you shall know that I am the Lord.
<br>8	And I will leave in you some that shall escape the sword among the nations, when I shall have scattered you through the countries.
<br>9	And they that are saved of you shall re- member me amongst the nations, to which they are carried captives: because I have broken their heart that was faithless, and revolted from me: and their eyes that went a fornicating after their idols: and they shall be displeased with them- selves because of the evils which they have com- mitted in all their abominations.
<br>10	And they shall know that I the Lord have not spoken in vain that I would do this evil to them.
<br>11	Thus saith the Lord God: Strike with thy hand and stamp with thy foot, and say: Alas, for all the abominations of the evils of the house of Israel: for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.
<br>12	He that is far off shall die of the pestilence: and he that is near, shall fall by the sword: and
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>he that remaineth, and is besieged, shall die by the famine: and I will accomplish my indignation upon them.
<br>13	And you shall know that I am the Lord, when your slain shall be amongst your idols, round about your altars, in every high hill, and on all the tops of mountains, and under every woody tree, and under every thick oak, the place where they burnt sweet smelling frankincense to all their idols.
<br>14	And I will stretch forth my hand upon them: and I will make the land desolate, and abandoned from the desert of Deblatha in all their dwelling places: and they shall know that I am the Lord.
<br>
<br>Chapter 7
<br>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
<br>2 And thou son of man, thus saith the Lord God to the land of Israel: The end is come, the end is come upon the four quarters of the land. 3 Now is an end come upon thee, and I will send my wrath upon thee, and I will judge thee according to thy ways: and I will set all thy
<br>abominations against thee.
<br>4 And my eye shall not spare thee, and I will shew thee no pity: but I will lay thy ways upon thee, and thy abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and you shall know that I am the Lord. 5 Thus saith the Lord God: One affliction,
<br>behold an affliction is come.
<br>6	An end is come, the end is come, it hath awaked against thee: behold it is come.
<br>7	Destruction is come upon thee that dwellest in the land: the time is come, the day of slaugh- ter is near, and not of the joy of mountains.
<br>8	Now very shortly I will pour out my wrath upon thee, and I will accomplish my anger in
<br> 
<br>thee: and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and I will lay upon thee all thy crimes.
<br>9	And my eye shall not spare, neither will I shew mercy: but I will lay thy ways upon thee, and thy abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and you shall know that I am the Lord that strike.
<br>10	Behold the day, behold it is come: destruc- tion is gone forth, the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded.
<br>11	Iniquity is risen up into a rod of impiety: nothing of them shall remain, nor of their people, nor of the noise of them: and there shall be no rest among them.
<br>12	The time is come, the day is at hand: let not the buyer rejoice: nor the seller mourn: for wrath is upon all the people thereof.
<br>13	For the seller shall not return to that which he hath sold, although their life be yet among the living. For the vision which regardeth all the multitude thereof, shall not go back: neither shall man be strengthened in the iniquity of his life.
<br>14	Blow the trumpet, let all be made ready, yet there is none to go to the battle: for my wrath shall be upon all the people thereof.
<br>15	The sword without: and the pestilence, and the famine within: he that is in the field shall die by the sword: and they that are in the city, shall be devoured by the pestilence, and the famine.
<br>16	And such of them as shall flee shall escape: and they shall be in the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them trembling, every one for his iniquity.
<br>17	All hands shall be made feeble, and all knees shall run with water.
<br>18	And they shall gird themselves with hair- cloth, and fear shall cover them and shame shall be upon every face, and baldness upon all their
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>heads.
<br>19	Their silver shall be cast forth, and their gold shall become a dunghill. Their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the Lord. They shall not satisfy their soul, and their bellies shall not be filled: because it hath been the stumblingblock of their iniquity.
<br>20	And they have turned the ornament of their jewels into pride, and have made of it the images of their abominations, and idols: there- fore I have made it an uncleanness to them.
<br>21	And I will give it into the hands of strangers for spoil, and to the wicked of the earth for a prey, and they shall defile it.
<br>22	And I will turn away my face from them, and they shall violate my secret place: and rob- bers shall enter into it, and defile it.
<br>23	Make a shutting up: for the land is full of the judgment of blood, and the city is full of iniquity.
<br>24	And I will bring the worst of the nations, and they shall possess their houses: and I will make the pride of the mighty to cease, and they shall possess their sanctuary.
<br>25	When distress cometh upon them, they will seek for peace and there shall be none.
<br>26	Trouble shall come upon trouble, and ru- mour upon rumour, and they shall seek a vision of the prophet, and the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients.
<br>27	The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with sorrow, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled. I will do to them according to their way, and will judge them according to their judgments: and they shall know that I am the Lord.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 8
<br>And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, and the ancients of Juda sat before me, that the hand of the Lord God fell there upon me.
<br>2	And I saw, and behold a likeness as the ap- pearance of fire: from the appearance of his loins, and downward, fire: and from his loins, and up- ward, as the appearance of brightness, as the appearance of amber.
<br>3	And the likeness of a hand was put forth and took me by a lock of my head: and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the vision of God into Jerusalem, near the inner gate, that looked toward the north, where was set the idol of jeal- ousy to provoke to jealousy.
<br>4	And behold the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the vision which I had seen in the plain.
<br>5	And he said to me: Son of man, lift up thy eyes towards the way of the north, and I lifted up my eyes towards the way of the north: and behold on the north side of the gate of the altar the idol of jealousy in the very entry.
<br>6	And he said to me: Son of man, dost thou see, thinkest thou, what these are doing, the great abominations that the house of Israel com- mitteth here, that I should depart far off from my sanctuary? and turn thee yet again and thou shalt see greater abominations.
<br>7	And he brought me in to the door of the court: and I saw, and behold a hole in the wall. 8 And he said to me: Son of man, dig in the wall, and when I had digged in the wall, behold
<br>a door.
<br>9	And he said to me: Go in, and see the wicked abominations which they commit here.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>10	And I went in and saw, and behold ev- ery form of creeping things, and of living crea- tures, the abominations, and all the idols of the house of Israel, were painted on the wall all round about.
<br>11	And seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel, and Jezonias the son of Saaphan stood in the midst of them, that stood before the pictures: and every one had a censer in his hand: and a cloud of smoke went up from the incense. 12 And he said to me: Surely thou seest, O son of man, what the ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every one in private in his chamber: for they say: The Lord seeth us not,
<br>the Lord hath forsaken the earth.
<br>13	And he said to me: If thou turn thee again, thou shalt see greater abominations which these commit.
<br>14	And he brought me in by the door of the gate of the Lord’s house, which looked to the north: and behold women sat there mourning for Adonis.
<br>15	And he said to me: Surely thou hast seen, O son of man: but turn thee again, thou shalt see greater abominations than these.
<br>16	And he brought me into the inner court of the house of the Lord: and behold at the door of the temple of the Lord, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men having their backs towards the temple of the Lord, in their faces to the east: and they adored towards the rising of the sun.
<br>17	And he said to me: Surely thou hast seen, O son of man: is this a light thing to the house of Juda, that they should commit these abomina- tions which they have committed here: because they have filled the land with iniquity, and have turned to provoke me to anger? and behold they put a branch to their nose.
<br>18	Therefore I also will deal with them in my
<br> 
<br>wrath: my eye shall not spare them, neither will I shew mercy: and when they shall cry to my ears with a loud voice, I will not hear them.
<br>
<br>Chapter 9
<br>And he cried in my ears with a loud voice, saying: The visitations of the city are at hand, and every one hath a destroying weapon in his hand.
<br>2	And behold six men came from the way of the upper gate, which looketh to the north: and each one had his weapon of destruction in his hand: and there was one man in the midst of them clothed with linen, with a writer’s inkhorn at his reins: and they went in, and stood by the brazen altar.
<br>3	And the glory of the Lord of Israel went up from the cherub, upon which he was, to the threshold of the house: and he called to the man that was clothed with linen, and had a writer’s inkhorn at his loins.
<br>4	And the Lord said to him: Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem: and mark Thau upon the foreheads of the men that sigh, and mourn for all the abom- inations that are committed in the midst thereof. 5 And to the others he said in my hearing: Go ye after him through the city, and strike: let not
<br>your eyes spare, nor be ye moved with pity.
<br>6	Utterly destroy old and young, maidens, children and women: but upon whomsoever you shall see Thau, kill him not, and begin ye at my sanctuary. So they began at the ancient men who were before the house.
<br>7	And he said to them: Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and slew them that were in the city.
<br>8	And the slaughter being ended I was left;
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>and I fell upon my face, and crying, I said: Alas, alas, alas, O Lord God, wilt thou then destroy all the remnant of Israel, by pouring out thy fury upon Jerusalem?
<br>9	And he said to me: The iniquity of the house of Israel, and of Juda, is exceeding great, and the land is filled with blood, and the city is filled with perverseness: for they have said: The Lord hath forsaken the earth, and the Lord seeth not.
<br>10	Therefore neither shall my eye spare, nor will I have pity: I will requite their way upon their head.
<br>11	And behold the man that was clothed with linen, that had the inkhorn at his back, returned the word, saying: I have done as thou hast com- manded me.
<br>
<br>Chapter 10
<br>And I saw and behold in the firmament that was over the heads of the cherubims, there appeared over them as it were the sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.
<br>2	And he spoke to the man, that was clothed with linen, and said: Go in between the wheels that are under the cherubims and fill thy hand with the coals of fire that are between the cheru- bims, and pour them out upon the city. And he went in, in my sight:
<br>3	And the cherubims stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in, and a cloud filled the inner court.
<br>4	And the glory of the Lord was lifted up from above the cherub to the threshold of the house: and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was filled with the brightness of the glory of the Lord.
<br>5	And the sound of the wings of the cherubims was heard even to the outward court as the voice
<br> 
<br>of God Almighty speaking.
<br>6	And when he had commanded the man that was clothed with linen, saying: Take fire from the midst of the wheels that are between the cheru- bims: he went in and stood beside the wheel.
<br>7	And one cherub stretched out his arm from the midst of the cherubims to the fire that was between the cherubims: and he took, and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen: who took it and went forth.
<br>8	And there appeared in the cherubims the likeness of a man’s hand under their wings.
<br>9	And I saw, and behold there were four wheels by the cherubims: one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the appearance of the wheels was to the sight like the chrysolite stone:
<br>10	And as to their appearance, all four were alike: as if a wheel were in the midst of a wheel. 11 And when they went, they went by four ways: and they turned not when they went: but to the place whither they first turned, the rest
<br>also followed, and did not turn back.
<br>12	And their whole body, and their necks, and their hands, and their wings, and the circles were full of eyes, round about the four wheels.
<br>13	And these wheels he called voluble, in my hearing.
<br>14	And every one had four faces: one face was the face of a cherub, and the second face, the face of a man: and in the third was the face of a lion: and in the fourth the face of an eagle.
<br>15	And the cherubims were lifted up: this is the living creature that I had seen by the river Chobar.
<br>16	And when the cherubims went, the wheels also went by them: and when the cherubims lifted up their wings, to mount up from the earth, the wheels stayed not behind, but were by them. 17 When they stood, these stood: and when
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>they were lifted up, these were lifted up: for the spirit of life was in them.
<br>18	And the glory of the Lord went forth from the threshold of the temple: and stood over the cherubims.
<br>19	And the cherubims lifting up their wings, were raised from the earth before me: and as they went out, the wheels also followed: and it stood in the entry of the east gate of the house of the Lord: and the glory of the God of Israel was over them.
<br>20	This is the living creature, which I saw un- der the God of Israel by the river Chobar: and I understood that they were cherubims.
<br>21	Each one had four faces, and each one had four wings: and the likeness of a man’s hand was under their wings.
<br>22	And as to the likeness of their faces, they were the same faces which I had seen by the river Chobar, and their looks, and the impulse of every one to go straight forward.
<br>
<br>Chapter 11
<br>And the spirit lifted me up, and brought me into the east gate of the house of the Lord, which looketh towards the rising of the sun: and behold in the entry of the gate five and twenty men: and I saw in the midst of them Jezonias the son of Azur, and Pheltias the son of Banaias, princes of the people.
<br>2	And he said to me: Son of man, these are the men that study iniquity, and frame a wicked counsel in this city,
<br>3	Saying: Were not houses lately built? This city is the caldron, and we the flesh.
<br>4	Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, thou son of man.
<br>5	And the spirit of the Lord fell upon me, and
<br> 
<br>said to me: Speak: Thus saith the Lord: Thus have you spoken, O house of Israel, for I know the thoughts of your heart.
<br>6	You have killed a great many in this city, and you have filled the streets thereof with the slain.
<br>7	Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Your slain, whom you have laid in the midst thereof, they are the flesh, all this is the caldron: and I will bring you forth out of the midst thereof.
<br>8	You have feared the sword, and I will bring the sword upon you, saith the Lord God.
<br>9	And I will cast you out of the midst thereof, and I will deliver you into the hand of the ene- mies, and I will execute judgments upon you.
<br>10	You shall fall by the sword: I will judge you in the borders of Israel, and you shall know that I am the Lord.
<br>11	This shall not be as a caldron to you, and you shall not be as flesh in the midst thereof: I will judge you in the borders of Israel.
<br>12	And you shall know that I am the Lord: because you have not walked in my command- ments, and have not done my judgments, but you have done according to the judgments of the nations that are round about you.
<br>13	And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pheltias the son of Banaias died: and I fell down upon my face, and I cried with a loud voice: and said: Alas, alas, alas, O Lord God: wilt thou make an end of all the remnant of Israel?
<br>14	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
<br>15	Son of man, thy brethren, thy brethren, thy kinsmen, and all the house of Israel, all they to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said: Get ye far from the Lord, the land is given in possession to us.
<br>16	Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Be- cause I have removed them far off among the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Gentiles, and because I have scattered them among the countries: I will be to them a lit- tle sanctuary in the countries whither they are come.
<br>17	Therefore speak to them: Thus saith the Lord God: I will gather you from among the peoples, and assemble you out of the countries wherein you are scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.
<br>18	And they shall go in thither, and shall take away all the scandals, and all the abominations thereof from thence.
<br>19	And I will give them one heart, and will put a new spirit in their bowels: and I will take away the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh:
<br>20	That they may walk in my commandments, and keep my judgments, and do them: and that they may be my people, and I may be their God. 21 But as for them whose heart walketh after their scandals and abominations, I will lay their
<br>way upon their head, saith the Lord God.
<br>22	And the cherubims lifted up their wings, and the wheels with them: and the glory of the God of Israel was over them.
<br>23	And the glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city, and stood over the mount that is on the east side of the city.
<br>24	And the spirit lifted me up, and brought me into Chaldea, to them of the captivity, in vision, by the spirit of God: and the vision which I had seen was taken up from me.
<br>25	And I spoke to them of the captivity all the words of the Lord, which he had shewn me.
<br>
<br>Chapter 12
<br>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
<br>2 Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a
<br> 
<br>provoking house: who have eyes to see, and see not: and ears to hear, and hear not: for they are a provoking house.
<br>3	Thou, therefore, O son of man, prepare thee all necessaries for removing, and remove by day into their sight: and thou shalt remove out of thy place to another place in their sight, if so be they will regard it: for they are a provoking house.
<br>4	And thou shalt bring forth thy furniture as the furniture of one that is removing by day in their sight: and thou shalt go forth in the evening in their presence, as one goeth forth that removeth his dwelling.
<br>5	Dig thee a way through the wall before their eyes: and thou shalt go forth through it.
<br>6	In their sight thou shalt be carried out upon men’s shoulders, thou shalt be carried out in the dark: thou shalt cover thy face, and shalt not see the ground: for I have set thee for a sign of things to come to the house of Israel.
<br>7	I did therefore as he had commanded me: I brought forth my goods by day, as the goods of one that removeth: and in the evening I digged through the wall with my hand, and I went forth in the dark, and was carried on men’s shoulders in their sight.
<br>8	And the word of the Lord came to me in the morning, saying:
<br>9	Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the provoking house, said to thee: What art thou doing?
<br>10	Say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: This burden concerneth my prince that is in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel, that are among them.
<br>11	Say: I am a sign of things to come to you: as I have done, so shall it be done to them: they shall be removed from their dwellings, and go into captivity.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>12	And the prince that is in the midst of them, shall be carried on shoulders, he shall go forth in the dark: they shall dig through the wall to bring him out: his face shall be covered, that he may not see the ground with his eyes.
<br>13	And I will spread my net over him, and he shall be taken in my net: and I will bring him into Babylon, into the land of the Chaldeans, and he shall not see it, and there he shall die.
<br>14	And all that are about him, his guards, and his troops I will scatter into every wind: and I will draw out the sword after them.
<br>15	And they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have dispersed them among the na- tions, and scattered them in the countries.
<br>16	And I will leave a few men of them from the sword, and from the famine, and from the pestilence: that they may declare all their wicked deeds among the nations whither they shall go: and they shall know that I am the Lord.
<br>17	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
<br>18	Son of man, eat thy bread in trouble and drink thy water in hurry and sorrow.
<br>19	And say to the people of the land: Thus saith the Lord God to them that dwell in Jerusalem in the land of Israel: They shall eat their bread in care, and drink their water in des- olation: that the land may become desolate from the multitude that is therein, for the iniquity of all that dwell therein.
<br>20	And the cities that are now inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be desolate: and you shall know that I am the Lord.
<br>21	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
<br>22	Son of man, what is this proverb that you have in the land of Israel? saying: The days shall be prolonged, and every vision shall fail.
<br>23	Say to them therefore: Thus saith the Lord
<br> 
<br>God: I will make this proverb to cease, neither shall it be any more a common saying in Israel: and tell them that the days are at hand, and the effect of every vision.
<br>24	For there shall be no more any vain visions, nor doubtful divination in the midst of the chil- dren of Israel.
<br>25	For I the Lord will speak: and what word soever I shall speak, it shall come to pass, and shall not be prolonged any more: but in your days, ye provoking house, I will speak the word, and will do it, saith the Lord God.
<br>26	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
<br>27	Son of man, behold the house of Israel, they that say: The visions that this man seeth, is for many days to come: and this man prophesieth of times afar off.
<br>28	Therefore say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: not one word of mine shall be prolonged any more: the word that I shall speak shall be accomplished, saith the Lord God.
<br>
<br>Chapter 13
<br>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
<br>2	Son of man, prophesy thou against the prophets of Israel that prophesy: and thou shalt say to them that prophesy out of their own heart: Hear ye the word of the Lord:
<br>3	Thus saith the Lord God: Woe to the foolish prophets that follow their own spirit, and see nothing.
<br>4	Thy prophets, O Israel, were like foxes in the deserts.
<br>5	You have not gone up to face the enemy, nor have you set up a wall for the house of Israel, to stand in battle in the day of the Lord.
<br>6	They see vain things, and they foretell lies,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>saying: The Lord saith: whereas the Lord hath not sent them: and they have persisted to con- firm what they have said.
<br>7	Have you not seen a vain vision and spoken a lying divination: and you say: The Lord saith: whereas I have not spoken.
<br>8	Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Because you have spoken vain things, and have seen lies: therefore behold I come against you, saith the Lord God.
<br>9	And my hand shall be upon the prophets that see vain things, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the council of my people, nor shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel, and you shall know that I am the Lord God.
<br>10	Because they have deceived my people, say- ing: Peace, and there is no peace: and the peo- ple built up a wall, and they daubed it with dirt without straw.
<br>11	Say to them that daub without tempering, that it shall fall: for there shall be an overflow- ing shower, and I will cause great hailstones to fall violently from above, and a stormy wind to throw it down.
<br>12	Behold, when the wall is fallen: shall it not be said to you: Where is the daubing wherewith you have daubed it?
<br>13	Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Lo, I will cause a stormy wind to break forth in my indignation, and there shall be an overflowing shower in my anger: and great hailstones in my wrath to consume.
<br>14	And I will break down the wall that you have daubed with untempered mortar: and I will make it even with the ground, and the founda- tion thereof shall be laid bare: and it shall fall, and shall be consumed in the midst thereof: and you shall know that I am the Lord.
<br> 
<br>15	And I will accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them that daub it without tem- pering the mortar, and I will say to you: The wall is no more, and they that daub it are no more.
<br>16	Even the prophets of Israel that prophesy to Jerusalem, and that see visions of peace for her: and there is no peace, saith the Lord God. 17 And thou, son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people that prophesy out of their own heart: and do thou prophesy against
<br>them,
<br>18 And say: Thus saith the Lord God: Woe to them that sew cushions under every elbow: and make pillows for the heads of persons of every age to catch souls: and when they caught the souls of my people, they gave life to their souls. 19 And they violated me among my people, for a handful of barley, and a piece of bread, to kill souls which should not die, and to save souls alive which should not live, telling lies to
<br>my people that believe lies.
<br>20	Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Behold I declare against your cushions, wherewith you catch flying souls: and I will tear them off from your arms: and I will let go the soul that you catch, the souls that should fly.
<br>21	And I will tear your pillows, and will deliver my people out of your hand, neither shall they be any more in your hands to be a prey: and you shall know that I am the Lord.
<br>22	Because with lies you have made the heart of the just to mourn, whom I have not made sorrowful: and have strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his evil way, and live.
<br>23	Therefore you shall not see vain things, nor divine divinations any more, and I will deliver my people out of your hand: and you shall know that I am the Lord.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 14
<br>And some of the ancients of Israel came to me, and sat before me.
<br>2	And the word of the Lord came to me, say- ing:
<br>3	Son of man, these men have placed their uncleannesses in their hearts, and have set up before their face the stumblingblock of their in- iquity: and shall I answer when they inquire of me?
<br>4	Therefore speak to them, and say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: Man, man of the house of Israel that shall place his uncleannesses in his heart, and set up the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and shall come to the prophet inquiring of me by him: I the Lord will answer him according to the multitude of his un- cleannesses:
<br>5	That the house of Israel may be caught in their own heart, with which they have departed from me through all their idols.
<br>6	Therefore say to the house of Israel: Thus saith the Lord God: Be converted, and depart from your idols, and turn away your faces from all your abominations.
<br>7	For every man of the house of Israel, and every stranger among the proselytes in Israel, if he separate himself from me, and place his idols in his heart, and set the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and come to the prophet to inquire of me by him: I the Lord will answer him by myself.
<br>8	And I will set my face against that man, and will make him an example, and a proverb, and will cut him off from the midst of my people: and you shall know that I am the Lord.
<br>9	And when the prophet shall err, and speak a word: I the Lord have deceived that prophet: and I will stretch forth my hand upon him, and
<br> 
<br>will cut him off from the midst of my people Israel.
<br>10	And they shall bear their iniquity: accord- ing to the iniquity of him that inquireth, so shall the iniquity of the prophet be.
<br>11	That the house of Israel may go no more astray from me, nor be polluted with all their transgressions: but may be my people, and I may be their God, saith the Lord of hosts.
<br>12	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
<br>13	Son of man, when a land shall sin against me, so as to transgress grievously, I will stretch forth my hand upon it, and will break the staff of the bread thereof: and I will send famine upon it, and will destroy man and beast out of it.
<br>14	And if these three men, Noe, Daniel, and Job, shall be in it: they shall deliver their own souls by their justice, saith the Lord of hosts.
<br>15	And if I shall bring mischievous beasts also upon the land to waste it, and it be desolate, so that there is none that can pass because of the beasts:
<br>16	If these three men shall be in it, as I live, saith the Lord, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters: but they only shall be delivered, and the land shall be made desolate.
<br>17	Or if I bring the sword upon that land, and say to the sword: Pass through the land: and I destroy man and beast out of it:
<br>18	And these three men be in the midst thereof: as I live, saith the Lord God, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they themselves alone shall be delivered.
<br>19	Or if I also send the pestilence upon that land, and pour out my indignation upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast:
<br>20	And Noe, and Daniel, and Job be in the midst thereof: as I live, saith the Lord God, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter: but they
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>shall only deliver their own souls by their justice. 21 For thus saith the Lord: Although I shall send in upon Jerusalem my four grievous judg- ments, the sword, and the famine, and the mis- chievous beasts, and the pestilence, to destroy
<br>out of it man and beast,
<br>22	Yet there shall be left in it some that shall be saved, who shall bring away their sons and daughters: behold they shall come among you, and you shall see their way, and their doings: and you shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, in all things that I have brought upon it.
<br>23	And they shall comfort you, when you shall see their ways, and their doings: and you shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, saith the Lord God.
