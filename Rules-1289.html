<br>(5) ensure that repayment of any loan from the bank will commence not later than 5 years after the project has been completed or, in the case of a highway project, the facility has opened to traffic, whichever is later;

<br>(i) United States not Obligated.—The deposit of Federal funds into an infrastructure bank established under this section shall not be construed as a commitment, guarantee, or obligation on the part of the United States to any third party, nor shall any third party have any right against the United States for payment solely by virtue of the contribution. Any security or debt-financing instrument issued by the infrastructure bank shall expressly state that the security or instrument does not constitute a commitment, guarantee, or obligation of the United States.
<br>
<br>(j) Management of Federal Funds.—Sections 3335 and 6503 of title 31 shall not apply to funds deposited into an infrastructure bank under this section.
<br>
