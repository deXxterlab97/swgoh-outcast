<br>
<br>In clause (1), the word "assistance" is substituted for " 'Federal assistance', 'Federal assistance programs', or 'federally assisted programs' " for consistency in the revised title and to have only one defined term in the chapter. The words "the transfer of anything of value for a public purpose of support or stimulation that is (A) authorized by a law of the United States" are substituted for "programs that provide assistance" for consistency with section 6101(3) of the revised title. The words "section 502 of the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act (Public Law 93–198, 87 Stat. 813, D.C. Code §47–3406)" are substituted for "article VI of the District of Columbia Revenue Act of 1947 (D.C. Code secs. 47–2501a and 47–2501b)" because the former has superseded the latter.
<br>
<br>Clause (3) restates the source provisions because of the definition of "executive agency" in section 102 of the revised title.
<br>
<br>In clause (4)(A) and (B), the word "grant" is substituted for " 'grant' or 'grant-in-aid' " for consistency in the revised title and to have only one defined term in the chapter.
<br>
<br>In clause (4)(B), the words "a private, nonprofit community organization eligible to receive amounts under the Community Services Block Grant Act (42 U.S.C. 9901 et seq.)" are substituted for "a community action agency under the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, as amended" because of section 683(c)(2) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (Pub. L. 97–35, 95 Stat. 519).
<br>
<br>In clause (4)(C), the words "whether public or private" are omitted as surplus. The words "law of the United States" are substituted for "Federal laws" for consistency.
<br>
<br>In clause (5), the words "head of a Federal agency" are omitted as unnecessary because heads of Federal agencies already have the authority to delegate.
<br>
<br>In clause (6), the words "local government" are substituted for " 'political subdivision' or 'local government' " for consistency in the revised title and to have only one defined term in the chapter. The words "unit of general local government" are substituted for "local unit of government, including specifically a county, municipality, city, town, township" to incorporate the definition in clause (9).
<br>
<br>In clause (7), the words "public-purpose local government" are substituted for "public-purpose corporation or other strictly limited purpose political subdivision" to eliminate unnecessary words.
<br>
<br>In clause (8), the words "the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico" are omitted as being included in "territory or possession of the United States" and as necessary because of 48:734.
<br>
<br>In clause (9), the word "parish" is omitted as included in county because of 1:2.
<br>1983 Act
<br>
<br>This amends 31:6501(1)(B) to clarify the section as enacted by the Act of Sept. 13, 1982 (Pub. L. 97–258, 96 Stat. 1005).

The words "executive agency" are substituted for "department or agency of the United States Government" because of the definition in sections 102 and 6501(3) of the revised title. The words "shall provide the requesting officer or legislature" are substituted for the last sentence of 42:4211 to eliminate unnecessary words. The word "information" is substituted for "such data" because it is more accurate. The words "in writing" and "actual" are omitted as unnecessary.
<br>§6503. Intergovernmental financing
<br>
<br>(a) Consistent with program purposes and with regulations of the Secretary, and in accordance with an agreement under subsection (b) entered into by the Secretary and a State—
<br>
<br>(1) the head of an executive agency (other than the Tennessee Valley Authority) carrying out a program shall schedule transfers of funds to the State under the program so as to minimize the time elapsing between transfer of funds from the United States Treasury and the issuance or redemption of checks, warrants, or payments by other means by a State; and
<br>
<br>(2) the State shall minimize the time elapsing between transfer of funds from the United States Treasury and the issuance or redemption of checks, warrants, or payments by other means for program purposes.
<br>
<br>(b)(1) The Secretary shall enter into an agreement with each State to which transfers of funds are made, which establishes procedures and requirements for implementing this section.
<br>
<br>(2) An agreement under this subsection shall—
<br>
<br>(A) specify procedures chosen by the State for carrying out transfers of funds under the agreement;
<br>
<br>(B) describe the process by which the Federal Government shall review and approve the implementation of the procedures specified under subparagraph (A);
<br>
<br>(C) establish the methods to be used for calculating and documenting payments of interest pursuant to this section; and
<br>
<br>(D) specify those types of costs directly incurred by the State for interest calculations required under this section, and require the Secretary to consider those costs in computing payments under this section.
<br>
<br>(3) The Secretary shall issue regulations establishing procedures and requirements for implementing this section with respect to a State with which no agreement is entered into by the Secretary under paragraph (1). Such regulations shall apply to a State until such time as the Secretary enters into an agreement with the State under paragraph (1).
<br>
<br>(c)(1) The Secretary shall issue regulations that shall require a State, when not inconsistent with program purposes, to pay interest to the United States on funds from the time funds are deposited by the United States to the State's account until the time that funds are paid out by the State in order to redeem checks or warrants or make payments by other means for program purposes. Except as provided under paragraph (3)(B) (relating to the Unemployment Trust Fund), the interest payable under this subsection shall be calculated at a rate equal to the average of the bond equivalent rates of 13-week Treasury bills auctioned during the period for which interest is calculated, as determined by the Secretary.
<br>
<br>(2) Except as provided in paragraph (3), amounts received by the United States as payment of interest under this subsection shall be deposited in the Treasury and credited as miscellaneous receipts.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) Amounts paid by a State under paragraph (1) as interest on funds paid to a State from a trust fund for which the Secretary is the trustee shall be credited to such trust fund.
<br>
<br>(B) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, amounts of interest paid by a State, on funds drawn from its account in the Unemployment Trust Fund, shall be deposited into that account and shall consist of actual interest earnings by the State, less related banking costs incurred by the State, for the period for which interest is calculated.
<br>
<br>(d)(1) If a State disburses its own funds for program purposes in accordance with Federal law, Federal regulation, or Federal-State agreement, the State shall be entitled to interest from the time the State's funds are paid out to redeem checks or warrants, or make payments by other means, until the Federal funds are deposited to the State's bank account. The Secretary shall pay, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, such amounts as may be necessary for interest owed to a State under this subsection. Such interest shall be calculated, at a rate equal to the average of the bond equivalent rates of 13-week Treasury bills auctioned during the period for which interest is calculated, as determined by the Secretary.
<br>
<br>(2) If interest is paid under this subsection as a result of a State disbursing its own funds before receiving payment from a trust fund for which the Secretary of the Treasury is the trustee, such interest shall be charged against such trust fund.
<br>
<br>(e) The budget submitted by the President under section 1105 of this title for a fiscal year shall include a statement specifying, for the most recently completed fiscal year, amounts of interest accrued to the Federal Government under subsection (c) and amounts of interest paid to States under subsection (d).
<br>
<br>(f) If a State receives refunds of funds disbursed by the State under a Federal program, the State shall return those refunds to the Federal executive agency administering the program or apply those refunds to reduce the amount of funds owed by the Federal Government to the State under such program. Interest earned on such refunds shall be considered when setting overall interest obligations between the State and the Federal Government as required by this section.
<br>
<br>(g) If the Federal Government makes a payment to a recipient under a Federal program, and a portion of the payment is an amount which the Federal Government is paying to such recipient on behalf of a State, such amount shall be considered to be a transfer of funds between the Federal Government and the State for purposes of this section.
<br>
<br>(h) A State may not be required by a law or regulation of the United States to deposit funds received by it in a separate bank account. However, a State shall account for funds made available to the State as United States Government funds in the accounts of the State. The head of the State agency concerned shall make periodic authenticated reports to the head of the appropriate Federal executive agency on the status and the application of the funds, the liabilities and obligations on hand, and other information required by the head of the executive agency. Records related to the funds received by the State shall be made available to the head of the executive agency, the Inspector General of the executive agency, and the Comptroller General for necessary audits.
<br>
<br>(i) The Secretary shall prescribe methods for the payment of interest under this section between the Federal Government and the States, including provisions for offsetting amounts owed by the respective parties. Such methods of payment shall require payment of interest on an annual basis and shall provide for comparable treatment in manner, technique, and timing for both the States and the Federal Government.
<br>
<br>(j) Consistent with Federal program purposes and regulations of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the head of a Federal executive agency carrying out a program shall execute grant awards to States on a timely basis to assure the availability of funds to accomplish transfers in compliance with subsection (a) of this section.

<br>§6506. Development assistance
<br>
<br>(a) The economic and social development of the United States and the achievement of satisfactory levels of living depend on the sound and orderly development of urban and rural areas. When urbanization proceeds rapidly, the sound and orderly development of urban communities depends to a large degree on the social and economic health and the sound development of smaller communities and rural areas.
<br>
<br>(b) The President shall prescribe regulations governing the formulation, evaluation, and review of United States Government programs and projects having a significant impact on area and community development (including programs and projects providing assistance to States and localities) to serve most effectively the basic objectives of subsection (a) of this section. The regulations shall provide for the consideration of concurrently achieving the following specific objectives and, to the extent authorized by law, reasoned choices shall be made between the objectives when they conflict:
<br>
<br>(1) appropriate land uses for housing, commercial, industrial, governmental, institutional, and other purposes.
<br>
<br>(2) wise development and conservation of all natural resources.
<br>
<br>(3) balanced transportation systems, including highway, air, water, pedestrian, mass transit, and other means to move people and goods.
<br>
<br>(4) adequate outdoor recreation and open space.
<br>
<br>(5) protection of areas of unique natural beauty and historic and scientific interest.
<br>
<br>(6) properly planned community facilities (including utilities for supplying power, water, and communications) for safely disposing of wastes, and for other purposes.
<br>
<br>(7) concern for high standards of design.
<br>
<br>(c) To the extent possible, all national, regional, State, and local viewpoints shall be considered in planning development programs and projects of the United States Government or assisted by the Government. State and local government objectives and the objectives of regional organizations shall be considered within a framework of national public objectives expressed in laws of the United States. Available projections of future conditions in the United States and needs of regions, States, and localities shall be considered in plan formulation, evaluation, and review.
<br>
<br>(d) To the maximum extent possible and consistent with national objectives, assistance for development purposes shall be consistent with and further the objectives of State, regional, and local comprehensive planning. Consideration shall be given to all developmental aspects of our total national community, including housing, transportation, economic development, natural and human resources development, community facilities, and the general improvement of living environments.
<br>
<br>(e) To the maximum extent practicable, each executive agency carrying out a development assistance program shall consult with and seek advice from all other significantly affected executive agencies in an effort to ensure completely coordinated programs. To the extent possible, systematic planning required by individual United States Government programs (such as highway construction, urban renewal, and open space) shall be coordinated with and, to the extent authorized by law, made part of comprehensive local and areawide development planning.
<br>
<br>(f) When a law of the United States provides that both a special-purpose unit of local government and a unit of general local government are eligible to receive a loan or grant, the head of an executive agency shall make the loan or grant to the unit of general local government instead of the special-purpose unit of local government in the absence of substantial reasons to the contrary.
<br>
<br>(g) The President may designate an executive agency to prescribe regulations to carry out this section.

<br>
<br>(a) Utilize the State process to determine official views of State and local elected officials.
<br>
<br>(b) Communicate with State and local elected officials as early in the program planning cycle as is reasonably feasible to explain specific plans and actions.
<br>
<br>(c) Make efforts to accommodate State and local elected officials' concerns with proposed Federal financial assistance and direct Federal development that are communicated through the designated State process. For those cases where the concerns cannot be accommodated, Federal officials shall explain the bases for their decision in a timely manner.
<br>
<br>(d) Allow the States to simplify and consolidate existing Federally required State plan submissions. Where State planning and budgeting systems are sufficient and where permitted by law, the substitution of State plans for Federally required State plans shall be encouraged by the agencies.
<br>
<br>(e) Seek the coordination of views of affected State and local elected officials in one State with those of another State when proposed Federal financial assistance or direct Federal development has an impact on interstate metropolitan urban centers or other interstate areas. Existing interstate mechanisms that are redesignated as part of the State process may be used for this purpose.
<br>
<br>(f) Support State and local governments by discouraging the reauthorization or creation of any planning organization which is Federally-funded, which has a Federally-prescribed membership, which is established for a limited purpose, and which is not adequately representative of, or accountable to, State or local elected officials.
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. (a) The State process referred to in Section 2 shall include those where States delegate, in specific instances, to local elected officials the review, coordination, and communication with Federal agencies.
<br>
<br>(b) At the discretion of the State and local elected officials, the State process may exclude certain Federal programs from review and comment.
<br>
<br>Sec. 4. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) shall maintain a list of official State entities designated by the States to review and coordinate proposed Federal financial assistance and direct Federal development. The Office of Management and Budget shall disseminate such lists to the Federal agencies.
<br>
<br>Sec. 5. (a) Agencies shall propose rules and regulations governing the formulation, evaluation, and review of proposed Federal financial assistance and direct Federal development pursuant to this Order, to be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for approval.
<br>
<br>(b) The rules and regulations which result from the process indicated in Section 5(a) above shall replace any current rules and regulations and become effective September 30, 1983.
<br>
<br>Sec. 6. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is authorized to prescribe such rules and regulations, if any, as he deems appropriate for the effective implementation and administration of this Order and the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act of 1968 [31 U.S.C. 6501 et seq.]. The Director is also authorized to exercise the authority vested in the President by Section 401(a) of that Act (42 U.S.C. 4231(a)) [31 U.S.C. 6506(a) and (b)] in a manner consistent with this Order.
<br>
<br>Sec. 7. The Memorandum of November 8, 1968, is terminated (33 Fed. Reg. 16487, November 13, 1968). The Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall revoke OMB Circular A–95, which was issued pursuant to that Memorandum. However, Federal agencies shall continue to comply with the rules and regulations issued pursuant to that Memorandum, including those issued by the Office of Management and Budget, until new rules and regulations have been issued in accord with this Order.
<br>
<br>Sec. 8. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall report to the President by September 30, 1984 on Federal agency compliance with this Order. The views of State and local elected officials on their experiences with these policies, along with any suggestions for improvement, will be included in the Director's report.

<br>
<br>(b)(1) A study under subsection (a) of this section of a grant program authorized by a law of the United States enacted before October 16, 1968, shall be conducted before the end of each 4th calendar year after the year during which a study of the program was last conducted under this section.

<br>In the section, the words "law of the United States" are substituted for "Act of Congress" for clarity. The word "grants" is substituted for "grants-in-aid", and the words "grant program" are substituted for "grant-in-aid program", for consistency in the chapter.

The words "committees of Congress" are substituted for "Committee of the Senate and the House of Representatives" for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The words "The committees may conduct" are added for clarity. The word "report" is substituted for "advise" for clarity. In clause (2), the word "assistance" is substituted for "financial assistance from the United States" because of the definition in section 6501(1) of the revised title.
<br>
