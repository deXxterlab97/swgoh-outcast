<br>§1901. Congressional findings
<br>
<br>Recognizing the special relationship between the United States and the Indian tribes and their members and the Federal responsibility to Indian people, the Congress finds—
<br>
<br>(1) that clause 3, section 8, article I of the United States Constitution provides that "The Congress shall have Power * * * To regulate Commerce * * * with Indian tribes 1" and, through this and other constitutional authority, Congress has plenary power over Indian affairs;
<br>
<br>(2) that Congress, through statutes, treaties, and the general course of dealing with Indian tribes, has assumed the responsibility for the protection and preservation of Indian tribes and their resources;
<br>
<br>(3) that there is no resource that is more vital to the continued existence and integrity of Indian tribes than their children and that the United States has a direct interest, as trustee, in protecting Indian children who are members of or are eligible for membership in an Indian tribe;
<br>
<br>(4) that an alarmingly high percentage of Indian families are broken up by the removal, often unwarranted, of their children from them by nontribal public and private agencies and that an alarmingly high percentage of such children are placed in non-Indian foster and adoptive homes and institutions; and
<br>
<br>(5) that the States, exercising their recognized jurisdiction over Indian child custody proceedings through administrative and judicial bodies, have often failed to recognize the essential tribal relations of Indian people and the cultural and social standards prevailing in Indian communities and families.

<br>§1902. Congressional declaration of policy
<br>
<br>The Congress hereby declares that it is the policy of this Nation to protect the best interests of Indian children and to promote the stability and security of Indian tribes and families by the establishment of minimum Federal standards for the removal of Indian children from their families and the placement of such children in foster or adoptive homes which will reflect the unique values of Indian culture, and by providing for assistance to Indian tribes in the operation of child and family service programs.

<br>SUBCHAPTER I—CHILD CUSTODY PROCEEDINGS
<br>§1911. Indian tribe jurisdiction over Indian child custody proceedings
<br>(a) Exclusive jurisdiction
<br>
<br>An Indian tribe shall have jurisdiction exclusive as to any State over any child custody proceeding involving an Indian child who resides or is domiciled within the reservation of such tribe, except where such jurisdiction is otherwise vested in the State by existing Federal law. Where an Indian child is a ward of a tribal court, the Indian tribe shall retain exclusive jurisdiction, notwithstanding the residence or domicile of the child.
<br>(b) Transfer of proceedings; declination by tribal court
<br>
<br>In any State court proceeding for the foster care placement of, or termination of parental rights to, an Indian child not domiciled or residing within the reservation of the Indian child's tribe, the court, in the absence of good cause to the contrary, shall transfer such proceeding to the jurisdiction of the tribe, absent objection by either parent, upon the petition of either parent or the Indian custodian or the Indian child's tribe: Provided, That such transfer shall be subject to declination by the tribal court of such tribe.
<br>(c) State court proceedings; intervention
<br>
<br>In any State court proceeding for the foster care placement of, or termination of parental rights to, an Indian child, the Indian custodian of the child and the Indian child's tribe shall have a right to intervene at any point in the proceeding.
<br>(d) Full faith and credit to public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of Indian tribes
<br>
<br>The United States, every State, every territory or possession of the United States, and every Indian tribe shall give full faith and credit to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of any Indian tribe applicable to Indian child custody proceedings to the same extent that such entities give full faith and credit to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of any other entity.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 95–608, title I, §101, Nov. 8, 1978, 92 Stat. 3071.)
<br>§1912. Pending court proceedings
<br>(a) Notice; time for commencement of proceedings; additional time for preparation
<br>
<br>In any involuntary proceeding in a State court, where the court knows or has reason to know that an Indian child is involved, the party seeking the foster care placement of, or termination of parental rights to, an Indian child shall notify the parent or Indian custodian and the Indian child's tribe, by registered mail with return receipt requested, of the pending proceedings and of their right of intervention. If the identity or location of the parent or Indian custodian and the tribe cannot be determined, such notice shall be given to the Secretary in like manner, who shall have fifteen days after receipt to provide the requisite notice to the parent or Indian custodian and the tribe. No foster care placement or termination of parental rights proceeding shall be held until at least ten days after receipt of notice by the parent or Indian custodian and the tribe or the Secretary: Provided, That the parent or Indian custodian or the tribe shall, upon request, be granted up to twenty additional days to prepare for such proceeding.
<br>(b) Appointment of counsel
<br>
<br>In any case in which the court determines indigency, the parent or Indian custodian shall have the right to court-appointed counsel in any removal, placement, or termination proceeding. The court may, in its discretion, appoint counsel for the child upon a finding that such appointment is in the best interest of the child. Where State law makes no provision for appointment of counsel in such proceedings, the court shall promptly notify the Secretary upon appointment of counsel, and the Secretary, upon certification of the presiding judge, shall pay reasonable fees and expenses out of funds which may be appropriated pursuant to section 13 of this title.
<br>(c) Examination of reports or other documents
<br>
<br>Each party to a foster care placement or termination of parental rights proceeding under State law involving an Indian child shall have the right to examine all reports or other documents filed with the court upon which any decision with respect to such action may be based.
<br>(d) Remedial services and rehabilitative programs; preventive measures
<br>
<br>Any party seeking to effect a foster care placement of, or termination of parental rights to, an Indian child under State law shall satisfy the court that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.
<br>(e) Foster care placement orders; evidence; determination of damage to child
<br>
<br>No foster care placement may be ordered in such proceeding in the absence of a determination, supported by clear and convincing evidence, including testimony of qualified expert witnesses, that the continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.
<br>(f) Parental rights termination orders; evidence; determination of damage to child
<br>
<br>No termination of parental rights may be ordered in such proceeding in the absence of a determination, supported by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, including testimony of qualified expert witnesses, that the continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 95–608, title I, §102, Nov. 8, 1978, 92 Stat. 3071.)
<br>§1913. Parental rights; voluntary termination
<br>(a) Consent; record; certification matters; invalid consents
<br>
<br>Where any parent or Indian custodian voluntarily consents to a foster care placement or to termination of parental rights, such consent shall not be valid unless executed in writing and recorded before a judge of a court of competent jurisdiction and accompanied by the presiding judge's certificate that the terms and consequences of the consent were fully explained in detail and were fully understood by the parent or Indian custodian. The court shall also certify that either the parent or Indian custodian fully understood the explanation in English or that it was interpreted into a language that the parent or Indian custodian understood. Any consent given prior to, or within ten days after, birth of the Indian child shall not be valid.
<br>(b) Foster care placement; withdrawal of consent
<br>
<br>Any parent or Indian custodian may withdraw consent to a foster care placement under State law at any time and, upon such withdrawal, the child shall be returned to the parent or Indian custodian.
<br>(c) Voluntary termination of parental rights or adoptive placement; withdrawal of consent; return of custody
<br>
<br>In any voluntary proceeding for termination of parental rights to, or adoptive placement of, an Indian child, the consent of the parent may be withdrawn for any reason at any time prior to the entry of a final decree of termination or adoption, as the case may be, and the child shall be returned to the parent.
<br>(d) Collateral attack; vacation of decree and return of custody; limitations
<br>
<br>After the entry of a final decree of adoption of an Indian child in any State court, the parent may withdraw consent thereto upon the grounds that consent was obtained through fraud or duress and may petition the court to vacate such decree. Upon a finding that such consent was obtained through fraud or duress, the court shall vacate such decree and return the child to the parent. No adoption which has been effective for at least two years may be invalidated under the provisions of this subsection unless otherwise permitted under State law.

<br>§1914. Petition to court of competent jurisdiction to invalidate action upon showing of certain violations
<br>
<br>Any Indian child who is the subject of any action for foster care placement or termination of parental rights under State law, any parent or Indian custodian from whose custody such child was removed, and the Indian child's tribe may petition any court of competent jurisdiction to invalidate such action upon a showing that such action violated any provision of sections 1911, 1912, and 1913 of this title.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 95–608, title I, §104, Nov. 8, 1978, 92 Stat. 3072.)
<br>§1915. Placement of Indian children
<br>(a) Adoptive placements; preferences
<br>
<br>In any adoptive placement of an Indian child under State law, a preference shall be given, in the absence of good cause to the contrary, to a placement with (1) a member of the child's extended family; (2) other members of the Indian child's tribe; or (3) other Indian families.
<br>(b) Foster care or preadoptive placements; criteria; preferences
<br>
<br>Any child accepted for foster care or preadoptive placement shall be placed in the least restrictive setting which most approximates a family and in which his special needs, if any, may be met. The child shall also be placed within reasonable proximity to his or her home, taking into account any special needs of the child. In any foster care or preadoptive placement, a preference shall be given, in the absence of good cause to the contrary, to a placement with—
<br>
<br>(i) a member of the Indian child's extended family;
<br>
<br>(ii) a foster home licensed, approved, or specified by the Indian child's tribe;
<br>
<br>(iii) an Indian foster home licensed or approved by an authorized non-Indian licensing authority; or
<br>
<br>(iv) an institution for children approved by an Indian tribe or operated by an Indian organization which has a program suitable to meet the Indian child's needs.
<br>(c) Tribal resolution for different order of preference; personal preference considered; anonymity in application of preferences
<br>
<br>In the case of a placement under subsection (a) or (b) of this section, if the Indian child's tribe shall establish a different order of preference by resolution, the agency or court effecting the placement shall follow such order so long as the placement is the least restrictive setting appropriate to the particular needs of the child, as provided in subsection (b) of this section. Where appropriate, the preference of the Indian child or parent shall be considered: Provided, That where a consenting parent evidences a desire for anonymity, the court or agency shall give weight to such desire in applying the preferences.
<br>(d) Social and cultural standards applicable
<br>
<br>The standards to be applied in meeting the preference requirements of this section shall be the prevailing social and cultural standards of the Indian community in which the parent or extended family resides or with which the parent or extended family members maintain social and cultural ties.
<br>(e) Record of placement; availability
<br>
<br>A record of each such placement, under State law, of an Indian child shall be maintained by the State in which the placement was made, evidencing the efforts to comply with the order of preference specified in this section. Such record shall be made available at any time upon the request of the Secretary or the Indian child's tribe.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 95–608, title I, §105, Nov. 8, 1978, 92 Stat. 3073.)
<br>§1916. Return of custody
<br>(a) Petition; best interests of child
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding State law to the contrary, whenever a final decree of adoption of an Indian child has been vacated or set aside or the adoptive parents voluntarily consent to the termination of their parental rights to the child, a biological parent or prior Indian custodian may petition for return of custody and the court shall grant such petition unless there is a showing, in a proceeding subject to the provisions of section 1912 of this title, that such return of custody is not in the best interests of the child.
<br>(b) Removal from foster care home; placement procedure
<br>
<br>Whenever an Indian child is removed from a foster care home or institution for the purpose of further foster care, preadoptive, or adoptive placement, such placement shall be in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, except in the case where an Indian child is being returned to the parent or Indian custodian from whose custody the child was originally removed.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 95–608, title I, §106, Nov. 8, 1978, 92 Stat. 3073.)
<br>§1917. Tribal affiliation information and other information for protection of rights from tribal relationship; application of subject of adoptive placement; disclosure by court
<br>
<br>Upon application by an Indian individual who has reached the age of eighteen and who was the subject of an adoptive placement, the court which entered the final decree shall inform such individual of the tribal affiliation, if any, of the individual's biological parents and provide such other information as may be necessary to protect any rights flowing from the individual's tribal relationship.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 95–608, title I, §107, Nov. 8, 1978, 92 Stat. 3073.)
<br>§1918. Reassumption of jurisdiction over child custody proceedings
<br>(a) Petition; suitable plan; approval by Secretary
<br>
<br>Any Indian tribe which became subject to State jurisdiction pursuant to the provisions of the Act of August 15, 1953 (67 Stat. 588), as amended by title IV of the Act of April 11, 1968 (82 Stat. 73, 78), or pursuant to any other Federal law, may reassume jurisdiction over child custody proceedings. Before any Indian tribe may reassume jurisdiction over Indian child custody proceedings, such tribe shall present to the Secretary for approval a petition to reassume such jurisdiction which includes a suitable plan to exercise such jurisdiction.
<br>(b) Criteria applicable to consideration by Secretary; partial retrocession
<br>
<br>(1) In considering the petition and feasibility of the plan of a tribe under subsection (a), the Secretary may consider, among other things:
<br>
<br>(i) whether or not the tribe maintains a membership roll or alternative provision for clearly identifying the persons who will be affected by the reassumption of jurisdiction by the tribe;
<br>
<br>(ii) the size of the reservation or former reservation area which will be affected by retrocession and reassumption of jurisdiction by the tribe;
<br>
<br>(iii) the population base of the tribe, or distribution of the population in homogeneous communities or geographic areas; and
<br>
<br>(iv) the feasibility of the plan in cases of multitribal occupation of a single reservation or geographic area.
<br>
<br>(2) In those cases where the Secretary determines that the jurisdictional provisions of section 1911(a) of this title are not feasible, he is authorized to accept partial retrocession which will enable tribes to exercise referral jurisdiction as provided in section 1911(b) of this title, or, where appropriate, will allow them to exercise exclusive jurisdiction as provided in section 1911(a) of this title over limited community or geographic areas without regard for the reservation status of the area affected.
<br>(c) Approval of petition; publication in Federal Register; notice; reassumption period; correction of causes for disapproval
<br>
<br>If the Secretary approves any petition under subsection (a), the Secretary shall publish notice of such approval in the Federal Register and shall notify the affected State or States of such approval. The Indian tribe concerned shall reassume jurisdiction sixty days after publication in the Federal Register of notice of approval. If the Secretary disapproves any petition under subsection (a), the Secretary shall provide such technical assistance as may be necessary to enable the tribe to correct any deficiency which the Secretary identified as a cause for disapproval.
<br>(d) Pending actions or proceedings unaffected
<br>
<br>Assumption of jurisdiction under this section shall not affect any action or proceeding over which a court has already assumed jurisdiction, except as may be provided pursuant to any agreement under section 1919 of this title.

<br>(a) Subject coverage
<br>
<br>States and Indian tribes are authorized to enter into agreements with each other respecting care and custody of Indian children and jurisdiction over child custody proceedings, including agreements which may provide for orderly transfer of jurisdiction on a case-by-case basis and agreements which provide for concurrent jurisdiction between States and Indian tribes.
<br>(b) Revocation; notice; actions or proceedings unaffected

<br>
<br>Where any petitioner in an Indian child custody proceeding before a State court has improperly removed the child from custody of the parent or Indian custodian or has improperly retained custody after a visit or other temporary relinquishment of custody, the court shall decline jurisdiction over such petition and shall forthwith return the child to his parent or Indian custodian unless returning the child to his parent or custodian would subject the child to a substantial and immediate danger or threat of such danger.

<br>§1921. Higher State or Federal standard applicable to protect rights of parent or Indian custodian of Indian child
<br>

The State authority, official, or agency involved shall insure that the emergency removal or placement terminates immediately when such removal or placement is no longer necessary to prevent imminent physical damage or harm to the child and shall expeditiously initiate a child custody proceeding subject to the provisions of this subchapter, transfer the child to the jurisdiction of the appropriate Indian tribe, or restore the child to the parent or Indian custodian, as may be appropriate.

<br>SUBCHAPTER II—INDIAN CHILD AND FAMILY PROGRAMS
<br>§1931. Grants for on or near reservation programs and child welfare codes
<br>(a) Statement of purpose; scope of programs
<br>
<br>The Secretary is authorized to make grants to Indian tribes and organizations in the establishment and operation of Indian child and family service programs on or near reservations and in the preparation and implementation of child welfare codes. The objective of every Indian child and family service program shall be to prevent the breakup of Indian families and, in particular, to insure that the permanent removal of an Indian child from the custody of his parent or Indian custodian shall be a last resort. Such child and family service programs may include, but are not limited to—
<br>
<br>(1) a system for licensing or otherwise regulating Indian foster and adoptive homes;
<br>
<br>(2) the operation and maintenance of facilities for the counseling and treatment of Indian families and for the temporary custody of Indian children;
<br>
<br>(3) family assistance, including homemaker and home counselors, day care, afterschool care, and employment, recreational activities, and respite care;
<br>
<br>(4) home improvement programs;
<br>
<br>(5) the employment of professional and other trained personnel to assist the tribal court in the disposition of domestic relations and child welfare matters;
<br>
<br>(6) education and training of Indians, including tribal court judges and staff, in skills relating to child and family assistance and service programs;
<br>
<br>(7) a subsidy program under which Indian adoptive children may be provided support comparable to that for which they would be eligible as foster children, taking into account the appropriate State standards of support for maintenance and medical needs; and
<br>
<br>(8) guidance, legal representation, and advice to Indian families involved in tribal, State, or Federal child custody proceedings.
<br>(b) Non-Federal matching funds for related Social Security or other Federal financial assistance programs; assistance for such programs unaffected; State licensing or approval for qualification for assistance under federally assisted program
<br>
<br>Funds appropriated for use by the Secretary in accordance with this section may be utilized as non-Federal matching share in connection with funds provided under titles IV–B and XX of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 620 et seq., 1397 et seq.] or under any other Federal financial assistance programs which contribute to the purpose for which such funds are authorized to be appropriated for use under this chapter. The provision or possibility of assistance under this chapter shall not be a basis for the denial or reduction of any assistance otherwise authorized under titles IV–B and XX of the Social Security Act or any other federally assisted program. For purposes of qualifying for assistance under a federally assisted program, licensing or approval of foster or adoptive homes or institutions by an Indian tribe shall be deemed equivalent to licensing or approval by a State.

<br>Not later than 12 months after January 8, 2002, the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Education shall, in consultation with Indian tribes, Indian education organizations, and accrediting agencies, develop and submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a report on the desirability and feasibility of establishing a tribal accreditation agency that would—
<br>
<br>(i) review and acknowledge the accreditation standards for Bureau-funded schools; and
<br>
<br>(ii) establish accreditation procedures to facilitate the application, review of the standards and review processes, and recognition of qualified and credible tribal departments of education as accrediting bodies serving tribal schools.
<br>(2) Determination of accreditation to be applied
<br>
<br>The accreditation type applied for each school shall be determined by the tribal governing body, or the school board, if authorized by the tribal governing body.
<br>(3) Assistance to school boards
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary, through contracts and grants, shall provide technical and financial assistance to Bureau-funded schools, to the extent that necessary amounts are made available, to enable such schools to obtain the accreditation required under this subsection, if the school boards request that such assistance, in part or in whole, be provided.
<br>(B) Entities through which assistance may be provided
<br>
<br>The Secretary may provide such assistance directly or through the Department of Education, an institution of higher education, a private not-for-profit organization or for-profit organization, an educational service agency, or another entity with demonstrated experience in assisting schools in obtaining accreditation.
<br>(4) Application of current standards during accreditation
<br>
<br>A Bureau-funded school that is seeking accreditation shall remain subject to the standards issued under this section 1 and in effect on the day before January 8, 2002, until such time as the school is accredited, except that if any of such standards are in conflict with the standards of the accrediting agency, the standards of such agency shall apply in such case.
<br>(5) Annual report on unaccredited schools
<br>
<br>Not later than 90 days after the end of each school year, the Secretary shall prepare and submit to the Committee on Appropriations, the Committee on Education and the Workforce, and the Committee on Resources of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Appropriations, the Committee on Indian Affairs, and the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate, a report concerning unaccredited Bureau-funded schools that—
<br>
<br>(A) identifies those Bureau-funded schools that fail to be accredited or to be candidates for accreditation within the period provided for in paragraph (1);
<br>
<br>(B) with respect to each Bureau-funded school identified under subparagraph (A), identifies the reasons that each such school is not accredited or a candidate for accreditation, as determined by the appropriate accreditation agency, and a description of any possible way in which to remedy such nonaccreditation; and
<br>
<br>(C) with respect to each Bureau-funded school for which the reported reasons for the lack of accreditation under subparagraph (B) are a result of the school's inadequate basic resources, contains information and funding requests for the full funding needed to provide such schools with accreditation, such funds if provided shall be applied to such unaccredited school under this paragraph.
<br>(6) Opportunity to review and present evidence
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Prior to including a Bureau-funded school in an annual report required under paragraph (5), the Secretary shall—
<br>
<br>(i) ensure that the school has exhausted all administrative remedies provided by the accreditation agency; and
<br>
<br>(ii) provide the school with an opportunity to review the data on which such inclusion is based.
<br>(B) Provision of additional information
<br>
<br>If the school board of a school that the Secretary has proposed for inclusion in an annual report under paragraph (5) believes that such inclusion is in error, the school board may provide to the Secretary such information as the board believes is in conflict with the information and conclusions of the Secretary with respect to the determination to include the school in such annual report. The Secretary shall consider such information provided by the school board before making a final determination concerning the inclusion of the school in any such report.
<br>(C) Publication of accreditation status
<br>
<br>Not later than 30 days after making an initial determination to include a school in an annual report under paragraph (5), the Secretary shall make public the final determination on the accreditation status of the school.
<br>(7) School plan
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Not later than 120 days after the date on which a school is included in an annual report under paragraph (5), the school shall develop a school plan, in consultation with interested parties including parents, school staff, the school board, and other outside experts (if appropriate), that shall be submitted to the Secretary for approval. The school plan shall cover a 3-year period and shall—
<br>
<br>(i) incorporate strategies that address the specific issues that caused the school to fail to be accredited or fail to be a candidate for accreditation;
<br>
<br>(ii) incorporate policies and practices concerning the school that have the greatest likelihood of ensuring that the school will obtain accreditation during the 3-year period beginning on the date on which the plan is implemented;
<br>
<br>(iii) contain an assurance that the school will reserve the necessary funds, from the funds described in paragraph (3), for each fiscal year for the purpose of obtaining accreditation;
<br>
<br>(iv) specify how the funds described in clause (iii) will be used to obtain accreditation;
<br>
<br>(v) establish specific annual, objective goals for measuring continuous and significant progress made by the school in a manner that will ensure the accreditation of the school within the 3-year period described in clause (ii);

<br>(vi) identify how the school will provide written notification about the lack of accreditation to the parents of each student enrolled in such school, in a format and, to the extent practicable, in a language the parents can understand; and
<br>
<br>(vii) specify the responsibilities of the school board and any assistance to be provided by the Secretary under paragraph (3).
<br>(B) Implementation
<br>
<br>A school shall implement the school plan under subparagraph (A) expeditiously, but in no event later than the beginning of the school year following the school year in which the school was included in the annual report under paragraph (5) so long as the necessary resources have been provided to the school.
<br>(C) Review of plan
<br>

<br>(D) Failure of school plan of Bureau-operated school
<br>
<br>With respect to a Bureau-operated school that fails to be accredited at the end of the third full year immediately following the date that the school's plan was first in effect under paragraph (7), the Secretary may take one or more of the following corrective actions:
<br>
<br>(i) Institute and fully implement actions suggested by the accrediting agency.
<br>
<br>(ii) Consult with the tribe involved to determine the causes for the lack of accreditation including potential staffing and administrative changes that are or may be necessary.

If the tribe agrees to operate the school as a contract or grant school, the tribe shall prepare a plan, pursuant to paragraph (7), for approval by the Secretary in accordance with paragraph (7), to achieve accreditation.
<br>
<br>(II) If the tribe declines to assume control of the school, the Secretary, in consultation with the tribe, may contract with an outside entity, consistent with applicable law, or appoint a receiver or trustee to operate and administer the affairs of the school until the school is accredited. The outside entity, receiver, or trustee shall prepare a plan, pursuant to paragraph (7), for approval by the Secretary in accordance with paragraph (7).
<br>
<br>(III) Upon accreditation of the school, the Secretary shall allow the tribe to continue to operate the school as a grant or contract school, or if the school is being controlled by an outside entity, provide the tribe with the option to assume operation of the school as a contract school, in accordance with the Indian Self-Determination Act [25 U.S.C. 5321 et seq.], or as a grant school in accordance with the Tribally Controlled Schools Act of 1988 [25 U.S.C. 2501 et seq.], at the beginning of the school year following the school year in which the school obtains accreditation.
