<br>§1701r. Congressional findings respecting housing for senior citizens
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that there is a large and growing need for suitable housing for older people both in urban and rural areas. Our older citizens face special problems in meeting their housing needs because of the prevalence of modest and limited incomes among the elderly, their difficulty in obtaining liberal long-term home mortgage credit, and their need for housing planned and designed to include features necessary to the safety and convenience of the occupants in a suitable neighborhood environment. The Congress further finds that the present programs for housing the elderly under the Department of Housing and Urban Development have proven the value of Federal credit assistance in this field and at the same time demonstrated the urgent need for an expanded and more comprehensive effort to meet our responsibilities to our senior citizens.

<br>The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (hereinafter referred to as the "Secretary") is authorized to make, and contract to make, annual payments to a "housing owner" on behalf of "qualified tenants", as those terms are defined herein, in such amounts and under such circumstances as are prescribed in or pursuant to this section. In no case shall a contract provide for such payments with respect to any housing for a period exceeding forty years. The aggregate amount of the contracts to make such payments shall not exceed amounts approved in appropriation Acts, and payments pursuant to such contracts shall not exceed $150,000,000 per annum prior to July 1, 1969, which maximum dollar amount shall be increased by $40,000,000, on July 1, 1969, by $100,000,000 on July 1, 1970, and by $40,000,000 on July 1, 1971.
<br>(b) "Housing owner" defined; limitation on payments to housing owner
<br>
<br>As used in this section, the term "housing owner" means a private nonprofit corporation or other private nonprofit legal entity, a limited dividend corporation or other limited dividend legal entity, or a cooperative housing corporation, which is a mortgagor under section 221(d)(3) of the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1715l(d)(3)] and which, after August 10, 1965, has been approved for mortgage insurance thereunder and has been approved for receiving the benefits of this section: Provided, That, except as provided in subsection (j), no payments under this section may be made with respect to any property financed with a mortgage receiving the benefits of the interest rate provided for in the proviso in section 221(d)(5) of that Act [12 U.S.C. 1715l(d)(5)]. Such term also includes a private nonprofit corporation or other private nonprofit legal entity, a limited dividend corporation or other limited dividend legal entity, or a cooperative housing corporation, which is the owner of a rental or cooperative housing project financed under a State or local program providing assistance through loans, loan insurance, or tax abatement and which may involve either new or existing construction and which is approved for receiving the benefits of this section. Subject to the limitations provided in subsection (j), the term "housing owner" also has the meaning prescribed in such subsection. Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing payments to a housing owner with respect to projects in which all or part of the dwelling units do not contain kitchen facilities; but of the total amount of contracts to make annual payments approved in appropriation Acts pursuant to subsection (a) after December 31, 1970, not more than 10 per centum in the aggregate shall be made with respect to such projects.
<br>(c) Definitions
<br>
<br>As used in this section, the term—
<br>
<br>(1) "qualified tenant" means any individual or family having an income which would qualify such individual or family for assistance under section 1437f of title 42, except that such term shall also include any individual or family who was receiving assistance under this section on the day preceding December 21, 1979, so long as such individual or family continues to meet the conditions for such assistance which were in effect on such day; and
<br>
<br>(2) "income" means income from all sources of each member of the household, as determined in accordance with criteria prescribed by the Secretary. In determining amounts to be excluded from income, the Secretary may, in the Secretary's discretion, take into account the number of minor children in the household and such other factors as the Secretary may determine are appropriate.
<br>
<br>The terms "qualified tenant" and "tenant" include a member of a cooperative who satisfies the foregoing requirements and who, upon resale of his membership to the cooperative, will not be reimbursed for any equity increment accumulated through payments under this section. With respect to members of a cooperative, the terms "rental" and "rental charges" mean the charges under the occupancy agreements between such members and the cooperative.
<br>(d) Annual payment amount
<br>
<br>The amount of the annual payment with respect to any dwelling unit shall be the lesser of (1) 70 per centum of the fair market rent, or (2) the amount by which the fair market rental for such unit exceeds 30 per centum of the tenant's adjusted income.
<br>(e) Criteria and procedure for determining eligibility and rental charges; recertification of income; agreements for services required in selection of tenants; delegation of authority to issue certificates
<br>
<br>(1) For purposes of carrying out the provisions of this section, the Secretary shall establish criteria and procedures for determining the eligibility of occupants and rental charges, including criteria and procedures with respect to periodic review of tenant incomes and periodic adjustment of rental charges.
<br>
<br>(2) Procedures adopted by the Secretary hereunder shall provide for recertifications of the incomes of occupants no less frequently than annually for the purpose of adjusting rental charges and annual payments on the basis of occupants' incomes, but in no event shall rental charges adjusted under this section for any dwelling exceed the fair market rental of the dwelling.
<br>
<br>(3) The Secretary may enter into agreements, or authorize housing owners to enter into agreements, with public or private agencies for services required in the selection of qualified tenants, including those who may be approved, on the basis of the probability of future increases in their incomes, as lessees under an option to purchase (which will give such approved qualified tenants an exclusive right to purchase at a price established or determined as provided in the option) dwellings, and in the establishment of rentals. The Secretary is authorized (without limiting his authority under any other provision of law) to delegate to any such public or private agency his authority to issue certificates pursuant to this subsection.
<br>
<br>(4) No payments under this section may be made with respect to any property for which the costs of operation (including wages and salaries) are determined by the Secretary to be greater than similar costs of operation of similar housing in the community where the property is situated.
<br>(f) Omitted
<br>(g) Authority of Secretary
<br>
<br>The Secretary is authorized to make such rules and regulations, to enter into such agreements, and to adopt such procedures as he may deem necessary or desirable to carry out the provisions of this section. Nothing contained in this section shall affect the authority of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development with respect to any housing assisted under this section, section 221(d)(3), section 231(c)(3), or section 236 of the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1715l(d)(3), 1715v(c)(3), 1715z–1], or section 1701q of this title, including the authority to prescribe occupancy requirements under other provisions of law or to determine the portion of such housing which may be occupied by qualified tenants. To ensure that qualified tenants occupying that number of units with respect to which assistance was being provided under this section immediately prior to November 30, 1983, receive the benefit of assistance contracted for under this section, the Secretary shall offer annually to amend contracts entered into with owners of projects assisted under this section but not subject to mortgages insured under title II of the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1707 et seq.] to provide sufficient payments to cover 100 percent of the necessary rent increases and changes in the incomes of qualified tenants, subject to the availability of authority for such purpose under section 1437c(c) of title 42. The Secretary shall take such actions as may be necessary to ensure that payments, including payments that reflect necessary rent increases and changes in the incomes of tenants, are made on a timely basis for all units covered by contracts entered into under this section.
<br>(h) Authorization of appropriations
<br>
<br>There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section, including, but not limited to, such sums as may be necessary to make annual payments as prescribed in this section, pay for services provided under (or pursuant to agreements entered into under) subsection (e), and provide administrative expenses.

<br>
<br>(2) Of the amounts approved in appropriation Acts pursuant to subsection (a) for payments under this section in any year, not more than 5 per centum in the aggregate shall be paid with respect to properties of housing owners as defined in paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection, and not more than 5 per centum in the aggregate shall be paid with respect to properties of housing owners as defined in paragraphs (1)(B) and (1)(C) of this subsection.

<br>
<br>(1) unexpended balances of amounts of authority as set forth in certain letter agreements between the Department of Housing and Urban Development and such State or local housing finance agencies or State or local government agencies, and

<br>§1701t. Congressional affirmation of national goal of decent homes and suitable living environment for American families
<br>

<br>
<br>The Congress finds that this goal has not been fully realized for many of the Nation's lower income families; that this is a matter of grave national concern; and that there exist in the public and private sectors of the economy the resources and capabilities necessary to the full realization of this goal.
<br>
<br>The Congress declares that in the administration of those housing programs authorized by this Act which are designed to assist families with incomes so low that they could not otherwise decently house themselves, and of other Government programs designed to assist in the provision of housing for such families, the highest priority and emphasis should be given to meeting the housing needs of those families for which the national goal has not become a reality; and in the carrying out of such programs there should be the fullest practicable utilization of the resources and capabilities of private enterprise and of individual self-help techniques.

<br>§1701u. Economic opportunities for low- and very low-income persons
<br>(a) Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) Federal housing and community development programs provide State and local governments and other recipients of Federal financial assistance with substantial funds for projects and activities that produce significant employment and other economic opportunities;
<br>
<br>(2) low- and very low-income persons, especially recipients of government assistance for housing, often have restricted access to employment and other economic opportunities;
<br>
<br>(3) the employment and other economic opportunities generated by projects and activities that receive Federal housing and community development assistance offer an effective means of empowering low- and very low-income persons, particularly persons who are recipients of government assistance for housing; and
<br>
<br>(4) prior Federal efforts to direct employment and other economic opportunities generated by Federal housing and community development programs to low- and very low-income persons have not been fully effective and should be intensified.
<br>(b) Policy
<br>
<br>It is the policy of the Congress and the purpose of this section to ensure that the employment and other economic opportunities generated by Federal financial assistance for housing and community development programs shall, to the greatest extent feasible, be directed toward low- and very low-income persons, particularly those who are recipients of government assistance for housing.

<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>In other programs that provide housing and community development assistance, the Secretary shall ensure that, to the greatest extent feasible, and consistent with existing Federal, State, and local laws and regulations, opportunities for training and employment arising in connection with a housing rehabilitation (including reduction and abatement of lead-based paint hazards), housing construction, or other public construction project are given to low- and very low-income persons residing within the metropolitan area (or nonmetropolitan county) in which the project is located.
<br>(B) Priority

<br>§1701v. Congressional findings and declaration for improved architectural design in Government housing programs
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that Federal aids to housing have not contributed fully to improvement in architectural standards. This objective has been contemplated in Federal housing legislation since the establishment of mortgage insurance through the Federal Housing Administration.
<br>
<br>The Congress commends the Department of Housing and Urban Development for its recent efforts to improve architectural standards through competitive design awards and in other ways but at the same time recognizes that this important objective requires high priority if Federal aid is to make its full communitywide contribution toward improving our urban environment.
<br>
<br>The Congress further finds that even within the necessary budget limitations on housing for low and moderate income families architectural design could be improved not only to make the housing more attractive, but to make it better suited to the needs of occupants.
<br>
<br>The Congress declares that in the administration of housing programs which assist in the provision of housing for low and moderate income families, emphasis should be given to encouraging good design as an essential component of such housing and to developing housing which will be of such quality as to reflect its important relationship to the architectural standards of the neighborhood and community in which it is situated, consistent with prudent budgeting.
