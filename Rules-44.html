<br>And departing from Mara, they came into Elim, where there were twelve fountains of wa- ters, and seventy palm trees: and there they
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>camped.
<br>But departing from thence also, they pitched their tents by the Red Sea. And depart- ing from the Red Sea,
<br>They camped in the desert of Sin.
<br>And they removed from thence, and came to Daphca.
<br>And departing from Daphca, they camped in Alus.
<br>And departing from Alus, they pitched their tents in Raphidim, where the people wanted water to drink.
<br>And departing from Raphidim, they camped in the desert of Sinai.
<br>But departing also from the desert of Sinai, they came to the graves of lust.
<br>And departing from the graves of lust, they camped in Haseroth.
<br>And from Haseroth they came to Rethma.
<br>And departing from Rethma, they camped in Remmomphares.
<br>And they departed from thence and came to Lebna.
<br>Removing from Lebna they camped in Ressa.
<br>And departing from Ressa,  they came to Ceelatha.
<br>And they removed from thence and camped in the mountain Sepher.
<br>Departing from the mountain Sepher, they came to Arada,
<br>From thence they went and camped in Maceloth.
<br>And departing from Maceloth, they came to Thahath.
<br>Removing from Thahath they camped in Thare.
<br>And they departed from thence, and pitched their tents in Methca.
<br> 
<br>And removing from Methca, they camped in Hesmona.
<br>And departing from Hesmona, they came to Moseroth.
<br>And removing from Moseroth, they camped in Benejaacan.
<br>And departing from Benejaacan, they came to mount Gadgad.
<br>From thence they went and camped in Jete- batha.
<br>And from Jetebatha they came to Hebrona.
<br>And departing from Hebrona, they camped in Asiongaber.
<br>They removed from thence and came into the desert of Sin, which is Cades.
<br>And departing from Cades, they camped in mount Hor, in the uttermost borders of the land of Edom.
<br>And Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor at the commandment of the Lord: and there he died in the fortieth year of the coming forth of the children of Israel out of Egypt, the fifth month, the first day of the month,
<br>When he was a hundred and twenty-three years old.
<br>And king Arad the Chanaanite, who dwelt towards the south, heard that the children of Is- rael were come to the land of Chanaan.
<br>And they departed from mount Hor, and camped in Salmona.
<br>From whence they removed and came to Phunon.
<br>And departing from Phunon, they camped in Oboth.
<br>And from Oboth they came to Ijeabarim, which is in the borders of the Moabites.
<br>And departing from Ijeabarim they pitched their tents in Dibongab.
<br>From thence they went and camped in Hel- mondeblathaim.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>And departing from Helmondeblathaim, they came to the mountains of Abarim over against Nabo.
<br>And departing from the mountains of Abarim, they passed to the plains of Moab, by the Jordan, over against Jericho.
<br>And there they camped from Bethsimoth even to Ablesatim in the plains of the Moabites,
<br>Where the Lord said to Moses:
<br>Command the children of Israel, and say to them: When you shall have passed over the Jordan, entering into the land of Chanaan,
<br>Destroy all the inhabitants of that land: Beat down their pillars, and break in pieces their statues, and waste all their high places,
<br>Cleansing the land, and dwelling in it. For I have given it you for a possession.
<br>And you shall divide it among you by lot. To the more you shall give a larger part, and to the fewer a lesser. To every one as the lot shall fall, so shall the inheritance be given. The possession shall be divided by the tribes and the families.
<br>But if you will not kill the inhabitants of the land: they that remain, shall be unto you as nails in your eyes, and spears in your sides, and they shall be your adversaries in the land of your habitation.
<br>And whatsoever I had thought to do to them, I will do to you.
<br>
<br>Chapter 34
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>Command the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: When you are entered into the land of Chanaan, and it shall be fallen into your possession by lot, it shall be bounded by these limits:
<br> 
<br>The south side shall begin from the wilder- ness of Sin, which is by Edom: and shall have the most salt sea for its furthest limits eastward: 4 Which limits shall go round on the south side by the ascent of the Scorpion and so into Senna, and reach toward the south as far as Cadesbarne, from whence the frontiers shall go out to the town called Adar, and shall reach as
<br>far as Asemona.
<br>And the limits shall fetch a compass from Asemona to the torrent of Egypt, and shall end in the shore of the great sea.
<br>And the west side shall begin from the great sea, and the same shall be the end thereof.
<br>But toward the north side the borders shall begin from the great sea, reaching to the most high mountain,
<br>From which they shall come to Emath, as far as the borders of Sedada:
<br>And the limits shall go as far as Zephrona, and the village of Enan. These shall be the bor- ders on the north side.
<br>From thence they shall mark out the grounds towards the east side from the village of Enan unto Sephama.
<br>And from Sephama the bounds shall go down to Rebla over against the fountain of Daph- nis: from thence they shall come eastward to the sea of Cenereth,
<br>And shall reach as far as the Jordan, and at the last shall be closed in by the most salt sea. This shall be your land with its borders round about.
<br>And Moses commanded the children of Is- rael, saying: This shall be the land which you shall possess by lot, and which the Lord hath commanded to be given to the nine tribes, and to the half tribe.
<br>For the tribe of the children of Ruben by their families, and the tribe of the children of
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Gad according to the number of their kindreds, and half of the tribe of Manasses,
<br>That is, two tribes and a half, have received their portion beyond the Jordan over against Jericho at the east side.
<br>And the Lord said to Moses:
<br>These are the names of the men, that shall divide the land unto you: Eleazar the priest, and Josue the son of Nun,
<br>And one prince of every tribe,
<br>Whose names are these: Of the tribe of Juda, Caleb the son of Jephone.
<br>Of the tribe of Simeon, Samuel the son of Ammiud.
<br>Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chaselon.
<br>Of the tribe of the children of Dan, Bocci the son of Jogli.
<br>Of the children of Joseph of the tribe of Manasses, Hanniel the son of Ephod.
<br>Of the tribe of Ephraim, Camuel the son of Sephtan.
<br>Of the tribe of Zabulon, Elisaphan the son of Pharnach.
<br>Of the tribe of Issachar, Phaltiel the prince, the son of Ozan.
<br>Of the tribe of Aser, Ahiud the son of Sa- lomi.
<br>Of the tribe of Nephtali: Phedael the son of Ammiud.
<br>These are they Whom the Lord hath com- manded to divide the land of Chanaan to the children of Israel.
<br>
<br>Chapter 35
<br>And the Lord spoke these things also to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan, over against Jericho:
<br> 
<br>Command the children of Israel that they give to the Levites out of their possessions,
<br>Cities to dwell in, and their suburbs round about: that they may abide in the towns, and the suburbs may be for them cattle and beasts: 4 Which suburbs  shall reach from the walls of the cities outward, a thousand paces on every
<br>side:
<br>Toward the east shall be two thousand cu- bits: and toward the south in like manner shall be two thousand cubits: toward the sea also, which looketh to the west, shall be the same ex- tent: and the north side shall be bounded with the like limits. And the cities shall be in the midst, and the suburbs without.
<br>And among the cities, which you shall give to the Levites, six shall be separated for refuge to fugitives, that he who hath shed blood may flee to them: and besides these there shall be other forty-two cities,
<br>That is, in all forty-eight with their suburbs. 8 And of these cities which shall be given out of the possessions of the children of Israel, from them that have more, more shall be taken: and from them that have less, fewer. Each shall give towns to the Levites according to the extent of
<br>their inheritance.
<br>The Lord said to Moses:
<br>Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: When you shall have passed over the Jordan into the land of Chanaan,
<br>Determine what cities shall be for the refuge of fugitives, who have shed blood against their will.
<br>And when the fugitive shall be in them, the kinsman of him that is slain may not have power to kill him, until he stand before the multitude, and his cause be judged.
<br>And of those cities, that are separated for the refuge of fugitives,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Three shall be beyond the Jordan, and three in the land of Chanaan,
<br>As well for the children of Israel as for strangers and sojourners, that he may flee to them, who hath shed blood against his will.
<br>If any man strike with iron, and he die that was struck: he shall be guilty of murder, and he himself shall die.
<br>If he throw a stone, and he that is struck die: he shall be punished in the same manner.
<br>If he that is struck with wood die: he shall be revenged by the blood of him that struck him. 19 The kinsman of him that was slain, shall kill the murderer: as soon as he apprehendeth
<br>him, he shall kill him.
<br>If through hatred any one push a man, or fling any thing at him with ill design:
<br>Or being his enemy, strike him with his hand, and he die: the striker shall be guilty of murder: the kinsman of him that was slain as soon as he findeth him, shall kill him.
<br>But if by chance medley, and without ha- tred,
<br>And enmity, he do any of these things,
<br>And this be proved in the hearing of the people, and the cause be debated between him that struck, and the next of kin:
<br>The innocent shall be delivered from the hand of the revenger, and shall be brought back by sentence into the city, to which he had fled, and he shall abide there until the death of the high priest, that is anointed with the holy oil.
<br>If the murderer be found without the limits of the cities that are appointed for the banished, 27 And be struck by him that is the avenger of blood: he shall not be guilty that killed him. 28 For the fugitive ought to have stayed in the city until the death of the high priest: and after he is dead, then shall the manslayer return to his
<br>own country.
<br> 
<br>These things shall be perpetual, and for an ordinance in all your dwellings.
<br>The murderer shall be punished by wit- nesses: none shall be condemned upon the evi- dence of one man.
<br>You shall not take money of him that is guilty of blood, but he shall die forthwith.
<br>The banished and fugitives before the death of the high priest may by no means return into their own cities.
<br>Defile not the land of your habitation, which is stained with the blood of the innocent: neither can it otherwise be expiated, but by his blood that hath shed the blood of another.
<br>And thus shall your possession be cleansed, myself abiding with you. For I am the Lord that dwell among the children of Israel.
<br>
<br>Chapter 36
<br>And the princes of the families of Galaad, the son of Machir, the son of Manasses, of the stock of the children of Joseph, came and spoke to Moses before the princes of Israel, and said:
<br>The Lord hath commanded thee, my lord, that thou shouldst divide the land by lot to the children of Israel, and that thou shouldst give to the daughters of Salphaad our brother the pos- session due to their father:
<br>Now if men of another tribe take them to wives, their possession will follow them, and be- ing transferred to another tribe, will be a dimin- ishing of our inheritance.
<br>And so it shall cone to pass, that when the jubilee, the is, the fiftieth year of remission, is come, the distribution made by the lots shall be confounded, and the possession of the one shall pass to the others.
<br>Moses answered the children of Israel, and
<br> 
<br>
<br>said by the command of the Lord: The tribe of the children of Joseph hath spoken rightly.
<br>And this is the law promulgated by the Lord touching the daughters of Salphaad: Let them marry to whom they will, only so that it be to men of their own tribe.
<br>Lest the possession of the children of Israel be mingled from tribe to tribe. For all men shall marry wives of their own tribe and kindred:
<br>And all women shall take husbands of the same tribe: that the inheritance may remain in the families.
<br>And that the tribes be not mingled one with another, but remain so
<br>As they were separated by the Lord. And the daughters of Salphaad did as was com- manded:
<br>And Maala, and Thersa, and Hegla, and Melcha, and Noa were married to the sons of their uncle by their father
<br>Of the family of Manasses, who was the son of Joseph: and the possession that had been al- lotted to them, remained in the tribe and family of their father.
<br>These are the commandments and judg- ment, which the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses to the children of Israel, in the plains of Moab upon the Jordan over against Jericho.

<br>Book of Deuteronomy
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>
<br>These are the words, which Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan, in the plain wilderness, over against the Red Sea, beetween Pharan and Thophel and Laban and Haseroth, where there is very much gold.
<br>Eleven days’ journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir to Cadesbarne.
<br>In the fortieth year, the eleventh month, the first day of the month, Moses spoke to the chil- dren of Israel all that the Lord had commanded him to say to them:
<br>After that he had slain Sehon king of the Amorrhites, who dwelt in Hesebon: and Og king of Basan who abode in Astaroth, and in Edrai,
<br>Beyond the Jordan in the land of Moab. And Moses began to expound the law, and to say:
<br>The Lord our God spoke to us in Horeb, say- ing: You have stayed long enough in this moun- tain:
<br>Turn you, and come to the mountain of the Amorrhites, and to the other places that are next to it, the plains and the hills and the vales to- wards the south, and by the sea shore, the land of the Chanaanites, and of Libanus, as far as the great river Euphrates.
<br>Behold, said he, I have delivered it to you: go in and possess it, concerning which the Lord swore to your fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Ja- cob, that he would give it to them, and to their
<br> 
<br>seed after them.
<br>And I said to you at that time:
<br>I alone am not able to bear you: for the Lord your God hath multiplied you, and you are this day as the stars of heaven, for multitude.
<br>(The Lord God of your fathers add to this number many thousands, and bless you as he hath spoken.)
<br>I alone am not able to bear your business, and the charge of you and your differences.
<br>Let me have from among you wise and un- derstanding men, and such whose conversation is approved among your tribes, that I may appoint them your rulers.
<br>Then you answered me: The thing is good which thou meanest to do.
<br>And I took out of your tribes men wise and honourable, and appointed them rulers, tri- bunes, and centurions, and officers over fifties, and over tens, who might teach you all things.
<br>And I commanded them, saying: Hear them, and judge that which is just: whether he be one of your country, or a stranger.
<br>There shall be no difference of persons, you shall hear the little as well as the great: neither shall you respect any man’s person, because it is the judgment of God. And if any thing seem hard to you, refer it to me, and I will hear it.
<br>And I commanded you all things that you were to do.
<br>And departing from Horeb, we passed
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>through the terrible and vast wilderness, which you saw, by the way of the mountain of the Am- orrhite, as the Lord our God had commanded us. And when we were come into Cadesbarne,
<br>I said to you: You are come to the moun- tain of the Amorrhite, which the Lord our God will give to us.
<br>See the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee: go up and possess it, as the Lord our God hath spoken to thy fathers: fear not, nor be any way discouraged.
<br>And you came all to me, and said: Let us send men who may view the land, and bring us word what way we shall go up, and to what cities we shall go.
<br>And because the saying pleased me, I sent of you twelve men, one of every tribe:
<br>Who, when they had set forward and had gone up to the mountains, came as far as the valley of the cluster: and having viewed the land, 25 Taking of the fruits thereof, to shew its fertility, they brought them to us, and said: The land is good, which the Lord our God will give
<br>us.
<br>And you would not go up, but being in- credulous to the word of the Lord our God,
<br>You murmured in your tents, and said: The Lord hateth us, and therefore he hath brought us out of the land of Egypt, that he might deliver us into the hand of the Amorrhite, and destroy us.
<br>Whither shall we go up? the messengers have terrified our hearts, saying: The multitude is very great, and taller than we: the cities are great, and walled up to the sky, we have seen the sons of the Enacims there.
<br>And I said to you: Fear not, neither be ye afraid of them:
<br>The Lord God, who is your leader, himself will fight for you, as he did in Egypt in the sight
<br> 
<br>of all.
<br>And in the wilderness (as thou hast seen) the Lord thy God hath carried thee, as a man is wont to carry his little son, all the way that you have come, until you came to this place.
<br>And yet for all this you did not believe the Lord your God,
<br>Who went before you in the way, and marked out the place, wherein you should pitch your tents, in the night shewing you the way by fire, and in the day by the pillar of a cloud.
<br>And when the Lord had heard the voice of your words, he was angry and swore, and said:
<br>Not one of the men of this wicked gener- ation shall see the good land, which I promised with an oath to your fathers:
<br>Except Caleb the son of Jephone: for he shall see it, and to him I will give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath followed the Lord.
<br>Neither is his indignation against the peo- ple to be wondered at, since the Lord was angry with me also on your account, and said: Neither shalt thou go in thither.
<br>But Josue the son of Nun, thy minister, he shall go in for thee: exhort and encourage him, and he shall divide the land by lot to Israel.
<br>Your children, of whom you said that they should be led away captives, and your sons who know not this day the difference of good and evil, they shall go in: and to them I will give the land, and they shall possess it.
<br>But return you and go into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.
<br>And you answered me: We have sinned against the Lord: we will go up and fight, as the Lord our God hath commanded. And when you went ready armed unto the mountain,
<br>The Lord said to me: Say to them: Go not up, and fight not, for I am not with you: lest you
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>fall before your enemies.
<br>I spoke, and you hearkened not: but resist- ing the commandment of the Lord, and swelling with pride, you went up into the mountain.
<br>And the Amorrhite that dwelt in the moun- tains coming out, and meeting you, chased you, as bees do: and made slaughter of you from Seir as far as Horma.
<br>And when you returned and wept before the Lord, he heard you not, neither would he yield to your voice.
<br>So you abode in Cadesbarne a long time.
<br>
<br>Chapter 2
<br>And departing from thence we came into the wilderness that leadeth to the Red Sea, as the Lord had spoken to me: and we compassed mount Seir a long time.
<br>And the Lord said to me:
<br>You have compassed this mountain long enough: go toward the north:
<br>And command thou the people, saying: You shall pass by the borders of your brethren the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir, and they will be afraid of you.
<br>Take ye then good heed that you stir not against them. For I will not give you of their land so much as the step of one foot can tread upon, because I have given mount Seir to Esau, for a possession.
<br>You shall buy meats of them for money and shall eat: you shall draw waters for money, and shall drink.
<br>The Lord thy God hath blessed thee in every work of thy hands: the Lord thy God dwelling with thee, knoweth thy journey, how thou hast passed through this great wilderness, for forty years, and thou hast wanted nothing.
<br> 
<br>And when we had passed by our brethren the children of Esau, that dwelt in Seir, by the way of the plain from Elath and from Asiongaber, we came to the way that leadeth to the desert of Moab.
<br>And the Lord said to me: Fight not against the Moabites, neither go to battle against them: for I will not give thee any of their land, because I have given Ar to the children of Lot in posses- sion.
<br>The Emims first were the inhabitants thereof, a people great, and strong, and so tall, that like the race of the Enacims,
<br>They were esteemed as giants, and were like the sons of the Enacims. But the Moabites call them Emims.
<br>The Horrhites also formerly dwelt in Seir: who being driven out and destroyed, the children of Esau dwelt there, as Israel did in the land of his possession, which the Lord gave him.
<br>Then rising up to pass the torrent Zared, we came to it.
<br>And the time that we journeyed from Cadesbarne till we passed over the torrent Zared, was thirty-eight years: until all the generation of the men that were fit for war was consumed out of the camp, as the Lord had sworn:
<br>For his hand was against them, that they should perish from the midst of the camp.
<br>And after all the fighting men were dead,
<br>The Lord spoke to me, saying:
<br>Thou shalt pass this day the borders of Moab, the city named Ar:
<br>And when thou comest nigh the frontiers of the children of Ammon, take heed thou fight not against them, nor once move to battle: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon, because I have given it to the children of Lot for a possession.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>It was accounted a land of giants: and gi- ants formerly dwelt in it, whom the Ammonites call Zomzommims,
<br>A people great and many, and of tall stature, like the Enacims whom the Lord de- stroyed before their face: and he made them to dwell in their stead,
<br>As he had done in favour of the children of Esau, that dwell in Seir, destroying the Hor- rhites, and delivering their land to them, which they possess to this day.
<br>The Hevites also, that dwelt in Haserim as far as Gaza, were expelled by the Cappado- cians: who came out of Cappadocia, and de- stroyed them and dwelt in their stead.
<br>Arise ye, and pass the torrent Arnon: Be- hold I have delivered into thy hand Sehon king of Hesebon the Amorrhite, and begin thou to possess his land and make war against him.
<br>This day will I begin to send the dread and fear of thee upon the nations that dwell under the whole heaven: that when they hear thy name they may fear and tremble, and be in pain like women in travail.
<br>So I sent messengers from the wilderness of Cademoth to Sehon the king of Hesebon with peaceable words, saying:
<br>We will pass through thy land, we will go along by the highway: we will not turn aside neither to the right hand nor to the left.
<br>Sell us meat for money, that we may eat: give us water for money and so we will drink. We only ask that thou wilt let us pass through, 29 As the children of Esau have done, that dwell in Seir, and the Moabites, that abide in Ar: until we come  to the Jordan, and pass to
<br>the land which the Lord our God will give us.
<br>30 And Sehon the king of Hesebon would not let us pass: because the Lord thy God had hard- ened his spirit, and fixed his heart, that he might
<br> 
<br>be delivered into thy hands, as now thou seest.
<br>And the Lord said to me: Behold I have begun to deliver unto thee Sehon and his land, begin to possess it.
<br>And Sehon came out to meet us with all his people to fight at Jasa.
<br>And the Lord our God delivered him to us: and we slew him with his sons and all his people. 34 And we took all his cities at that time, killing the inhabitants of them, men and women
<br>and children. We left nothing of them:
<br>Except the cattle which came to the share of them that took them: and the spoils of the cities, which we took:
<br>From Aroer, which is upon the bank of the torrent Arnon, a town that is situate in a valley, as far as Galaad. There was not a village or city, that escaped our hands: the Lord our God delivered all unto us:
<br>Except the land of the children of Ammon, to which we approached not: and all that bor- der upon the torrent Jeboc, and the cities in the mountains, and all the places which the Lord our God forbade us.
<br>
<br>Chapter 3
<br>Then we turned and went by the way of Basan: and Og the king of Basan came out to meet us with his people to fight in Edrai.
<br>And the Lord said to me: Fear him not: because he is delivered into thy hand, with all his people and his land: and thou shalt do to him as thou hast done to Sehon king of the Amorrhites, that dwelt in Hesebon.
<br>So the Lord our God delivered into our hands, Og also, the king of Basan, and all his people: and we utterly destroyed them,
<br>Wasting all his cities at one time, there was
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>not a town that escaped us: sixty cities, all the country of Argob the kingdom of Og in Basan.
<br>All the cities were fenced with very high walls, and with gates and bars, besides innumer- able towns that had no walls.
<br>And we utterly destroyed them, as we had done to Sehon the king of Hesebon, destroying every city, men and women and children:
<br>But the cattle and the spoils of the cities we took for our prey.
<br>And we took at that time the land out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorrhites, that were beyond the Jordan: from the torrent Arnon unto the mount Hermon,
<br>Which the Sidonians call Sarion, and the Amorrhites Sanir:
<br>All the cities that are situate in the plain, and all the land of Galaad and Basan as far as Selcha and Edrai, cities of the kingdom of Og in Basan.
<br>For only Og king of Basan remained of the race of the giants. His bed of iron is shewn, which is in Rabbath of the children of Ammon, being nine cubits long, and four broad after the mea- sure of the cubit of a man’s hand.
<br>And we possessed the land at that time from Aroer, which is upon the bank of the tor- rent Arnon, unto the half of mount Galaad: and I gave the cities thereof to Ruben and Gad.
<br>And I delivered the other part of Galaad, and all Basan the kingdom of Og to the half tribe of Manasses, all the country of Argob: and all Basan is called the Land of giants.
<br>Jair the son of Manasses possessed all the country of Argob unto the borders of Gessuri, and Machati. And he called Basan by his own name, Havoth Jair, that is to say, the towns of Jair, until this present day.
<br>To Machir also I gave Galaad.
<br>And to the tribes of Ruben and Gad I gave
<br> 
<br>of the land of Galaad as far as the torrent Arnon, half the torrent, and the confines even unto the torrent Jeboc, which is the border of the children of Ammon:
<br>And the plain of the wilderness, and the Jordan, and the borders of Cenereth unto the sea of the desert, which is the most salt sea, to the foot of mount Phasga eastward.
<br>And I commanded you at that time, say- ing: The Lord your God giveth you this land for an inheritance, go ye well appointed before your brethren the children of Israel, all the strong men of you.
<br>Leaving your wives and children and cattle. For I know you have much cattle, and they must remain in the cities, which I have delivered to you.
<br>Until the Lord give rest to your brethren, as he hath given to you: and they also possess the land, which he will give them beyond the Jordan: then shall every man return to his possession, which I have given you.
<br>I commanded Josue also at that time, say- ing:Thy eyes have seen what the Lord your God hath done to these two kings: so will he do to all the kingdoms to which thou shalt pass.
<br>Fear them not: for the Lord your God will fight for you.
<br>And I besought the Lord at that time, say- ing:
<br>Lord God, thou hast begun to shew unto thy servant thy greatness, and most mighty hand, for there is no other God either in heaven or earth, that is able to do thy works, or to be compared to thy strength.
<br>I will pass over therefore, and will see this excellent land beyond the Jordan, and this goodly mountain, and Libanus.
<br>And the Lord was angry with me on your account and heard me not, but said to me: It is
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>enough: speak no more to me of this matter.
<br>Go up to the top of Phasga, and cast thy eyes round about to the west, and to the north, and to the south, and to the east, and behold it, for thou shalt not pass this Jordan.
<br>Command Josue, and encourage and strengthen him: for he shall go before this peo- ple, and shall divide unto them the land which thou shalt see.
<br>And we abode in the valley over against the temple of Phogor.
<br>
<br>Chapter 4
<br>And now, O Israel, hear the commandments and judgments which I teach thee: that doing them, thou mayst live, and entering in mayst possess the land which the Lord the God of your fathers will give you.
<br>You shall not add to the word that I speak to you, neither shall you take away from it: keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you.
<br>Your eyes have seen all that the Lord hath done against Beelphegor, how he hath destroyed all his worshippers from among you.
<br>But you that adhere to the Lord your God, are all alive until this present day.
<br>You know that I have taught you statutes and justices, as the Lord my God hath com- manded me: so shall you do them in the land which you shall possess:
<br>And you shall observe, and fulfil them in practice. For this is your wisdom, and under- standing in the sight of nations, that hearing all these precepts, they may say: Behold a wise and understanding people, a great nation.
<br>Neither is there any other nation so great, that hath gods so nigh them, as our God is
<br> 
<br>present to all our petitions.
<br>For what other nation is there so renowned that hath ceremonies, and just judgments, and all the law, which I will set forth this day before our eyes?
<br>Keep thyself therefore, and thy soul care- fully. Forget not the words that thy eyes have seen, and let them not go out of thy heart all the days of thy life. Thou shalt teach them to thy sons and to thy grandsons,
<br>From the day in which thou didst stand before the Lord thy God in Horeb, when the Lord spoke to me, saying: Call together the people unto me, that they may hear my words, and may learn to fear me all the time that they live on the earth, and may teach their children.
<br>And you came to the foot of the mount, which burned even unto heaven: and there was darkness, and a cloud and obscurity in it.
<br>And the Lord spoke to you from the midst of the fire. You heard the voice of his words, but you saw not any form at all.
<br>And he shewed you his covenant, which he commanded you to do, and the ten words that he wrote in two tables of stone.
<br>And he commanded me at that time that I should teach you the ceremonies and judgments which you shall do in the land, that you shall possess.
<br>Keep therefore your souls carefully. You saw not any similitude in the day that the Lord God spoke to you in Horeb from the midst of the fire:
<br>Lest perhaps being deceived you might make you a graven similitude, or image of male or female,
<br>The similitude of any beasts, that are upon the earth, or of birds, that fly under heaven,
<br>Or of creeping things, that move on the earth, or of fishes, that abide in the waters under
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>the earth:
<br>Lest perhaps lifting up thy eyes to heaven, thou see the sun and the moon, and all the stars of heaven, and being deceived by error thou adore and serve them, which the Lord thy God created for the service of all the nations, that are under heaven.
<br>But the Lord hath taken you and brought you out of the iron furnaces of Egypt, to make you his people of inheritance, as it is this present day.
<br>And the Lord was angry with me for your words, and he swore that I should not pass over the Jordan, nor enter into the excellent land, which he will give you.
<br>Behold I die in this land, I shall not pass over the Jordan: you shall pass, and possess the goodly land.
<br>Beware lest thou ever forget the covenant of the Lord thy God, which he hath made with thee: and make to thyself a graven likeness of those things which the Lord hath forbid to be made:
<br>Because the Lord thy God is a consuming fire, a jealous God.
<br>If you shall beget sons and grandsons, and abide in the land, and being deceived, make to yourselves any similitude, committing evil before the Lord your God, to provoke him to wrath:
<br>I call this day heaven and earth to witness, that you shall quickly perish out of the land, which, when you have passed over the Jordan, you shall possess. You shall not dwell therein long, but the Lord will destroy you,
<br>And scatter you among all nations, and you shall remain a few among the nations, to which the Lord shall lead you.
<br>And there you shall serve gods, that were framed with men’s hands: wood and stone, that neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.
<br> 
<br>And when thou shalt seek there the Lord thy God, thou shalt find him: yet so, if thou seek him with all thy heart, and all the affliction of thy soul.
<br>After all the things aforesaid shall find thee, in the latter time thou shalt return to the Lord thy God, and shalt hear his voice.
<br>Because the Lord thy God is a merciful God: he will not leave thee, nor altogether de- stroy thee, nor forget the covenant, by which he swore to thy fathers.
<br>Ask of the days of old, that have been be- fore thy time from the day that God created man upon the earth, from one end of heaven to the other end thereof, if ever there was done the like thing, or it hath been known at any time,
<br>That a people should hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of fire, as thou hast heard, and lived:
<br>If God ever did so as to go, and take to himself a nation out of the midst of nations by temptations, signs, and wonders, by fight, and a strong hand, and stretched out arm, and horrible visions according to all the things that the Lord your God did for you in Egypt, before thy eyes. 35 That thou mightest know that the Lord he
<br>is God, and there is no other besides him.
<br>36 From heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might teach thee. And upon earth he shewed thee his exceeding great fire, and thou didst hear his words out of the midst of the fire, 37 Because he loved thy fathers, and chose their seed after them. And he brought thee out of Egypt, going before thee with his great power, 38 To destroy at thy coming very great na- tions, and stronger than thou art, and to bring thee in, and give thee their land for a possession,
<br>as thou seest at this present day.
<br>39 Know therefore this day, and think in thy heart that the Lord he is God in heaven above,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>and in the earth beneath, and there is no other.
<br>40	Keep his precepts and commandments, which I command thee: that it may be well with thee, and thy children after thee, and thou mayst remain a long time upon the land, which the Lord thy God will give thee.
<br>41	Then Moses set aside three cities beyond the Jordan at the east side,
<br>42	That any one might flee to them who should kill his neighbour unwillingly, and was not his enemy a day or two before, and that he might escape to some one of these cities:
<br>43	Bosor in the wilderness, which is situate in the plains of the tribe of Ruben: and Ramoth in Galaad, which is in the tribe of Gad: and Golan in Basan, which is in the tribe of Manasses.
<br>44	This is the law, that Moses set before the children of Israel,
<br>45	And these are the testimonies and cere- monies and judgments, which he spoke to the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt,
<br>46	Beyond the Jordan in the valley over against the temple of Phogor, in the land of Se- hon king of the Amorrhites, that dwelt in Hes- ebon, whom Moses slew. And the children of Israel coming out of Egypt,
<br>47	Possessed his land, and the land of Og king of Basan, of the two kings of the Amorrhites, who were beyond the Jordan towards the rising of the sun:
<br>48	From Aroer, which is situate upon the bank of the torrent Arnon, unto mount Sion, which is also called Hermon,
<br>49	All the plain beyond the Jordan at the east side, unto the sea of the wilderness, and unto the foot of mount Phasga.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 5
<br>And Moses called all Israel, and said to them: Hear, O Israel, the ceremonies and judgments, which I speak in your ears this day: learn them, and fulfil them in work.
<br>The Lord our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.
<br>He made not the covenant with our fathers, but with us, who are now present and living.
<br>He spoke to us face to face in the mount out of the midst of fire.
<br>I was the mediator and stood between the Lord and you at that time, to shew you his words, for you feared the fire, and went not up into the mountain, and he said:
<br>I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
<br>Thou shalt not have strange gods in my sight.
<br>Thou shalt not make to thy self a graven thing, nor the likeness of any things, that are in heaven above, or that are in the earth beneath, or that abide in the waters under the earth.
<br>Thou shalt not adore them, and thou shalt not serve them. For I am the Lord thy God, a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon their children unto the third and fourth generation, to them that hate me,
<br>And shewing mercy unto many thousands, to them that love me, and keep my command- ments.
<br>Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain: for he shall not be unpunished that taketh his name upon a vain thing.
<br>Observe the day of the sabbath, to sanctify it, as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee.
<br>Six days shalt thou labour, and shalt do all thy works.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>The seventh is the day of the sabbath, that is, the rest of the Lord thy God. Thou shalt not do any work therein, thou nor thy son nor thy daughter, nor thy manservant nor thy maidser- vant, nor thy ox, nor thy ass, nor any of thy beasts, nor the stranger that is within thy gates: that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest, even as thyself.
<br>Remember that thou also didst serve in Egypt, and the Lord thy God brought thee out from thence with a strong hand, and a stretched out arm. Therefore hath he commanded thee that thou shouldst observe the sabbath day.
<br>Honour thy father and mother, as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee, that thou mayst live a long time, and it may be well with thee in the land, which the Lord thy God will give thee.
<br>Thou shalt not kill.
<br>Neither shalt thou commit adultery.
<br>And thou shalt not steal.
<br>Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour.
<br>Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s wife: nor his house, nor his field, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is his.
<br>These words the Lord spoke to all the mul- titude of you in the mountain, out of the midst of the fire and the cloud, and the darkness, with a loud voice, adding nothing more: and he wrote them in two tables of stone, which he delivered unto me.
<br>But you, after you heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, and saw the mountain burn, came to me, all the princes of the tribes and the elders, and you said:
<br>Behold the Lord our God hath shewn us his majesty and his greatness, we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire, and have proved this day that God speaking with man, man hath
<br> 
<br>lived.
<br>Why shall we die therefore, and why shall this exceeding great fire comsume us: for if we hear the voice of the Lord our God any more, we shall die.
<br>What is all flesh, that it should hear the voice of the living God, who speaketh out of the midst of the fire, as we have heard, and be able to live?
<br>Approach thou rather: and hear all things that the Lord our God shall say to thee, and thou shalt speak to us, and we will hear and will do them.
<br>And when the Lord had heard this, he said to me: I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they spoke to thee: they have spoken all things well.
<br>Who shall give them to have such a mind, to fear me, and to keep all my commandments at all times, that it may be well with them and with their children for ever?
<br>Go and say to them: Return into your tents.
<br>But stand thou here with me, and I will speak to thee all my commandments, and cere- monies and judgments: which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them in the land, which I will give them for a possession.
<br>Keep therefore and do the things which the Lord God hath commanded you: you shall not go aside neither to the right hand, nor to the left.
<br>But you shall walk in the way that the Lord your God hath commanded, that you may live, and it may be well with you, and your days may be long in the land of your possession.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 6
<br>These are the precepts, and ceremonies, and judgments, which the Lord your God com- manded that I should teach you, and that you should do them in the land into which you pass over to possess it:
<br>That thou mayst fear the Lord thy God, and keep all his commandments and precepts, which I command thee, and thy sons, and thy grandsons, all the days of thy life, that thy days may be prolonged.
<br>Hear, O Israel, and observe to do the things which the Lord hath commanded thee, that it may be well with thee, and thou mayst be greatly multiplied, as the Lord the God of thy fathers hath promised thee a land flowing with milk and honey.
<br>Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord. 5 Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart, and with thy whole soul, and with
<br>thy whole strength.
<br>And these words which I command thee this day, shall be in thy heart:
<br>And thou shalt tell them to thy children, and thou shalt meditate upon them sitting in thy house, and walking on thy journey, sleeping and rising.
<br>And thou shalt bind them as a sign on thy hand, and they shall be and shall move between thy eyes.
<br>And thou shalt write them in the entry, and on the doors of thy house.
<br>And when the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into the land, for which he swore to thy fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: and shall have given thee great and goodly cities, which thou didst not build,
<br>Houses full of riches, which thou didst not set up, cisterns which thou didst not dig, vine-
<br> 
<br>yards and oliveyards, which thou didst not plant,
<br>And thou shalt have eaten and be full:
<br>Take heed deligently lest thou forget the Lord, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, and shalt serve him only, and thou shalt swear by his name.
<br>You shall not go after the strange gods of all the nations, that are round about you:
<br>Because the Lord thy God is a jealous God in the midst of thee: lest at any time the wrath of the Lord thy God be kindled against thee, and take thee away from the face of the earth.
<br>Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God, as thou temptedst him in the place of temptation. 17 Keep the precepts of the Lord thy God, and the testimonies and ceremonies which he hath
<br>commanded thee.
<br>And do that which is pleasing and good in the sight of the Lord, that it may be well with thee: and going in thou mayst possess the goodly land, concerning which the Lord swore to thy fathers,
<br>That he would destroy all thy enemies be- fore thee, as he hath spoken.
<br>And when thy son shall ask thee to mor- row, saying: What mean these testimonies, and ceremonies and judgments, which the Lord our God hath commanded us?
<br>Thou shalt say to him: We were bondmen of Pharao in Egypt, and the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a strong hand.
<br>And he wrought signs and wonders great and very grievous in Egypt against Pharao, and all his house, in our sight,
<br>And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in and give us the land, con- cerning which he swore to our fathers.
<br>And the Lord commanded that we should do all these ordinances, and should fear the Lord
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>our God, that it might be well with us all the days of our life, as it is at this day.
<br>And he will be merciful to us, if we keep and do all his precepts before the Lord our God, as he hath commanded us.
<br>
<br>Chapter 7
<br>When the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into the land, which thou art going in to pos- sess, and shall have destroyed many nations be- fore thee, the Hethite, and the Gergezite, and the Amorrhite, and the Chanaanite, and the Pherezite, and the Hevite, and the Jebusite, seven nations much more numerous than thou art, and stronger than thou:
<br>And the Lord thy God shall have delivered them to thee, thou shalt utterly destroy them. Thou shalt make no league with them, nor shew mercy to them:
<br>Neither shalt thou make marriages with them. Thou shalt not give thy daughter to his son, nor take his daughter for thy son:
<br>For she will turn away thy son from following me, that he may rather serve strange gods, and the wrath of the Lord will be kindled, and will quickly destroy thee.
<br>But thus rather shall you deal with them: Destroy their altars, and break their statues, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven things.
<br>Because thou art a holy people to the Lord thy God. The Lord thy God hath chosen thee, to be his peculiar people of all peoples that are upon the earth.
<br>Not because you surpass all nations in num- ber, is the Lord joined unto you, and hath chosen you, for you are the fewest of any people:
<br>But because the Lord hath loved you, and
<br> 
<br>hath kept his oath, which he swore to your fa- thers: and hath brought you out with a strong hand, and redeemed you from the house of bondage, out of the hand of Pharao the king of Egypt.
<br>And thou shalt know that the Lord thy God, he is a strong and faithful God, keeping his covenant and mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his commandments, unto a thousand generations:
<br>And repaying forthwith them that hate him, so as to destroy them, without further de- lay immediately rendering to them what they de- serve.
<br>Keep therefore the precepts and ceremonies and judgments, which I command thee this day to do.
<br>If after thou hast heard these judgments, thou keep and do them, the Lord thy God will also keep his covenant to thee, and the mercy which he swore to thy fathers:
<br>And he will love thee and multiply thee, and will bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn, and thy vintage, thy oil, and thy herds, and the flocks of thy sheep upon the land, for which he swore to thy fathers that he would give it thee.
<br>Blessed shalt thou be among all people. No one shall be barren among you of either sex, neither of men nor cattle.
<br>The Lord will take away from thee all sickness: and the grievous infirmities of Egypt, which thou knowest, he will not bring upon thee, but upon thy enemies.
<br>Thou shalt consume all the people, which the Lord thy God will deliver to thee. Thy eye shall not spare them, neither shalt thou serve their gods, lest they be thy ruin.
<br>If thou say in thy heart: These nations are more than I, how shall I be able to destroy them?
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Fear not, but remember what the Lord thy God did to Pharao and to all the Egyptians,
<br>The exceeding great plagues, which thy eyes saw, and the signs and wonders, and the strong hand, and the stretched out arm, with which the Lord thy God brought thee out: so will he do to all the people, whom thou fearest.
<br>Moreover the Lord thy God will send also hornets among them, until he destroy and con- sume all that have escaped thee, and could hide themselves.
<br>Thou shalt not fear them, because the Lord thy God is in the midst of thee, a God mighty and terrible:
<br>He will consume these nations in thy sight by little and little and by degrees. Thou wilt not be able to destroy them altogether: lest perhaps the beasts of the earth should increase upon thee.
<br>But the Lord thy God shall deliver them in thy sight: and shall slay them until they be utterly destroyed.
<br>And he shall deliver their kings into thy hands, and thou shalt destroy their names from under Heaven: no man shall be able to resist thee, until thou destroy them.
<br>Their graven things thou shalt burn with fire: thou shalt not covet the silver and gold of which they are made, neither shalt thou take to thee any thing thereof, lest thou offend, because it is an abomination to the Lord thy God.
<br>Neither shalt thou bring any thing of the idol into thy house, lest thou become an anath- ema, like it. Thou shalt detest it as dung, and shalt utterly abhor it as uncleanness and filth, because it is an anathema.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 8
<br>All the commandments, that I command thee this day, take great care to observe: that you may live, and be multiplied, and going in may possess the land, for which the Lord swore to your fathers.
<br>And thou shalt remember all the way through which the Lord thy God hath brought thee for forty years through the desert, to afflict thee and to prove thee, and that the things that were known in thy heart might be made known, whether thou wouldst keep his commandments or no.
<br>He afflicted thee with want, and gave thee manna for thy food, which neither thou nor thy fathers knew: to shew that not in bread alone doth man live, but in every word that proceedeth from the mouth of God.
<br>Thy raiment, with which thou wast covered, hath not decayed for age, and thy foot is not worn, lo this is the fortieth year,
<br>That thou mayst consider in thy heart, that as a man traineth up his son, so the Lord thy God hath trained thee up.
<br>That thou shouldst keep the commandments of the Lord thy God, and walk in his ways, and fear him.
<br>For the Lord thy God will bring thee into a good land, of brooks and of waters, and of fountains: in the plains of which and the hills deep rivers break out:
<br>A land of wheat, and barley, and vineyards, wherein fig trees and pomegranates, and olive- yards grow: a land of oil and honey.
<br>Where without any want thou shalt eat thy bread, and enjoy abundance of all things: where the stones are iron, and out of its hills are dug mines of brass:
<br>That when thou hast eaten, and art full,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>thou mayst bless the Lord thy God for the ex- cellent land which he hath given thee.
<br>Take heed, and beware lest at any time thou forget the Lord thy God, and neglect his commandments and judgments and ceremonies, which I command thee this day:
<br>Lest after thou hast eaten and art filled, hast built goodly houses, and dwelt in them,
<br>And shalt have herds of oxen and flocks of sheep, and plenty of gold and of silver, and of all things,
<br>Thy heart be lifted up, and thou remember not the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage:
<br>And was thy leader in the great and ter- rible wilderness, wherein there was the serpent burning with his breath, and the scorpion and the dipsas, and no waters at all: who brought forth streams out of the hardest rock,
<br>And fed thee in the wilderness with manna which thy fathers knew not. And after he had af- flicted and proved thee, at the last he had mercy on thee,
<br>Lest thou shouldst say in thy heart: My own might, and the strength of my own hand have achieved all these things for me.
<br>But remember the Lord thy God, that he hath given thee strength, that he might fulfil his covenant, concerning which he swore to thy fa- thers, as this present day sheweth.
<br>But if thou forget the Lord thy God, and follow strange gods, and serve and adore them: behold now I foretell thee that thou shalt utterly perish.
<br>As the nations, which the Lord destroyed at thy entrance, so shall you also perish, if you be disobedient to the voice of the Lord your God.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 9
<br>Hear, O Israel: Thou shalt go over the Jor- dan this day; to possess nations very great, and stronger than thyself, cities great, and walled up to the sky,
<br>A people great and tall, the sons of the Enacims, whom thou hast seen, and heard of, against whom no man is able to stand.
<br>Thou shalt know therefore this day that the Lord thy God himself will pass over before thee, a devouring and consuming fire, to destroy and extirpate and bring them to nothing before thy face quickly, as he hath spoken to thee.
<br>Say not in thy heart, when the Lord thy God shall have destroyed them in thy sight: For my justice hath the Lord brought me in to possess this land, whereas these nations are destroyed for their wickedness.
<br>For it is not for thy justices, and the up- rightness of thy heart that thou shalt go in to possess their lands: but because they have done wickedly, they are destroyed at thy coming in: and that the Lord might aaccomplish his word, which he promised by oath to thy fathers Abra- ham, Isaac, and Jacob.
<br>Know therefore that the Lord thy God giveth thee not this excellent land in possession for thy justices, for thou art a very stiffnecked people.
<br>Remember, and forget not how thou pro- vokedst the Lord thy God to wrath in the wilder- ness. From the day that thou camest out of Egypt unto this place, thou hast always strove against the Lord.
<br>For in Horeb, also thou didst provoke him, and he was angry, and would have destroyed thee,
<br>When I went up into the mount to receive the tables of stone,  the tables of the covenant
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>which the Lord made with you: and I contin- ued in the mount forty days and nights, neither eating bread, nor drinking water.
<br>And the Lord gave me two tables of stone written with the finger of God, and containing all the words that he spoke to you in the mount from the midst of the fire, when the people were assembled together.
<br>And when forty days were passed, and as many nights, the Lord gave me the two tables of stone, the tables of the covenant,
<br>And said to me: Arise, and go down from hence quickly: for thy people, which thou hast brought out of Egypt, have quickly forsaken the way that thou hast shewn them, and have made to themselves a molten idol.
<br>And again the Lord said to me: I see that this people is stiffnecked:
<br>Let me alone that I may destroy them, and abolish their name from under heaven, and set thee over a nation, that is greater and stronger than this.
<br>And when I came down from the burning mount, and held the two tables of the covenant with both hands,
<br>And saw that you had sinned against the Lord your God, and had made to yourselves a molten calf, and had quickly forsaken his way, which he had shewn you:
<br>I cast the tables out of my hands, and broke them in your sight.
<br>And I fell down before the Lord as before, forty days and nights neither eating bread, nor drinking water, for all your sins, which you had committed against the Lord, and had provoked him to wrath:
<br>For I feared his indignation and anger, wherewith being moved against you, he would have destroyed you. And the Lord heard me this time also.
<br> 
<br>And he was exceeding angry against Aaron also, and would have destroyed him, and I prayed in like manner for him.
<br>And your sin that you had committed, that is, the calf, I took, and burned it with fire, and breaking it into pieces, until it was as small as dust, I threw it into the torrent, which cometh down from the mountain.
<br>At the burning also, and at the place of temptation, and at the graves of lust you pro- voked the Lord:
<br>And when he sent you from Cadesbarne, saying: Go up, and possess the land that I have given you, and you slighted the commandment of the Lord your God, and did not believe him, neither would you hearken to his voice:
<br>But were always rebellious from the day that I began to know you.
<br>And I lay prostrate before the Lord forty days and nights, in which I humbly besought him, that he would not destroy you as he had threatened:
<br>And praying, I said: O Lord God, destroy not thy people, and thy inheritance, which thou hast redeemed in thy greatness, whom thou hast brought out of Egypt with a strong hand.
<br>Remember thy servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: look not on the stubbornness of this people, nor on their wickedness and sin:
<br>Lest perhaps the inhabitants of the land, out of which thou hast brought us, say: The Lord could not bring them into the land that he promised them, and he hated them: therefore he brought them out, that he might kill them in the wilderness,
<br>Who are thy people and thy inheritance, whom thou hast brought out by thy great strength, and in thy stretched out arm.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 10
<br>At that time the Lord said to me: Hew thee two tables of stone like the former, and come up to me into the mount: and thou shalt make an ark of wood,
<br>And I will write on the tables the words that were in them, which thou brokest before, and thou shalt put them in the ark.
<br>And I made an ark of setim wood. And when I had hewn two tables of stone like the former, I went up into the mount, having them in my hands.
<br>And he wrote in the tables, according as he had written before, the ten words, which the Lord spoke to you in the mount from the midst of the fire, when the people were assembled: and he gave them to me.
<br>And returning from the mount, I came down, and put the tables into the ark, that I had made, and they are there till this present, as the Lord commanded me.
<br>And the children of Israel removed their camp from Beroth, of the children of Jacan into Mosera, where Aaron died and was buried, and Eleazar his son succeeded him in the priestly of- fice.
<br>From thence they came to Gadgad, from which place they departed, and camped in Jete- batha, in a land of waters and torrents.
<br>At that time he separated the tribe of Levi, to carry the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and to stand before him in the ministry, and to bless in his name until this present day.
<br>Wherefore Levi hath no part nor possession with his brethren: because the Lord himself is his possession, as the Lord thy God promised him.
<br>And I stood in the mount, as before, forty days and nights: and the Lord heard me this
<br> 
<br>time also, and would not destroy thee.
<br>And he said to me: Go, and walk before the people, that they may enter, and possess the land, which I swore to their fathers that I would give them.
<br>And now, Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but that thou fear the Lord thy God, and walk in his ways, and love him, and serve the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul:
<br>And keep the commandments of the Lord, and his ceremonies, which I command thee this day, that it may be well with thee?
<br>Behold heaven is the Lord’s thy God, and the heaven of heaven, the earth and all things that are therein.
<br>And yet the Lord hath been closely joined to thy fathers, and loved them and chose their seed after them, that is to say, you, out of all nations, as this day it is proved.
<br>Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and stiffen your neck no more.
<br>Because the Lord your God he is the God of gods, and the Lord of lords, a great God and mighty and terrible, who accepteth no person nor taketh bribes.
<br>He doth judgment to the fatherless and the widow, loveth the stranger, and giveth him food and raiment.
<br>And do you therefore love strangers, be- cause you also were strangers in the land of Egypt.
<br>Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, and serve him only: to him thou shalt adhere, and shalt swear by his name.
<br>He is thy praise, and thy God, that hath done for thee these great and terrible things, which thy eyes have seen.
<br>In seventy souls thy fathers went down into Egypt: and behold now the Lord thy God hath
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>multiplied thee as the stars of heaven.
<br>
<br>Chapter 11
<br>Therefore love the Lord thy God and observe his precepts and ceremonies, his judgments and commmandments at all times.
<br>Know this day the things that your chil- dren know not, who saw not the chastisements of the Lord your God, his great doings and strong hand, and stretched out arm,
<br>The signs and works which he did in the midst of Egypt to king Pharao, and to all his land,
<br>And to all the host of the Egyptians, and to their horses and chariots: how the waters of the Red Sea covered them, when they pursued you, and how the Lord destroyed them until this present day:
<br>And what he hath done to you in the wilder- ness, til you came to this place:
<br>And to Dathan and Abiron the sons of Eliab, who was the son of Ruben: whom the earth, opening her mouth swallowed up with their households and tents, and all their sub- stance, which they had in the midst of Israel.
<br>Your eyes have seen all the great works of the Lord, that he hath done,
<br>That you may keep all his commandments, which I command you this day, and may go in, and possess the land, to which you are entering, 9 And may live in it a long time: which the Lord promised by oath to your fathers, and to their seed, a land which floweth with milk and
<br>honey.
<br>10 For the land, which thou goest to possess, is not like the land of Egypt, from whence thou camest out, where, when the seed is sown, waters are brought in to water it after the manner of
<br> 
<br>gardens.
<br>But it is a land of hills and plains, expect- ing rain from heaven.
<br>And the Lord thy God doth always visit it, and his eyes are on it from the beginning of the year unto the end thereof.
<br>If then you obey my commandments, which I command you this day, that you love the Lord your God, and serve him with all your heart, and with all your soul:
<br>He will give to your land the early rain and the latter rain, that you may gather in your corn, and your wine, and your oil,
<br>And your hay out of the fields to feed your cattle, and that you may eat and be filled.
<br>Beware lest perhaps your heart be de- ceived, and you depart from the Lord, and serve strange gods, and adore them:
<br>And the Lord being angry shut up heaven, that the rain come not down, nor the earth yield her fruit, and you perish quickly from the excel- lent land, which the Lord will give you.
<br>Lay up these words in your hearts and minds, and hang them for a sign on your hands, and place them between your eyes.
<br>Teach your children that they meditate on them, when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest on the way, and when thou liest down and risest up.
<br>Thou shalt write them upon the posts and the doors of thy house:
<br>That thy days may be multiplied, and the days of thy children in the land which the Lord swore to thy fathers, that he would give them as long as the heaven hangeth over the earth.
<br>For if you keep the commandments which I command you, and do them, to love the Lord your God, and walk in all his ways, cleaving unto him,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>The Lord will destroy all these nations be- fore your face, and you shall possess them, which are greater and stronger than you.
<br>Every place, that your foot shall tread upon, shall be yours. From the desert, and from Libanus, from the great river Euphrates unto the western sea shall be your borders.
<br>None shall stand against you: the Lord your God shall lay the dread and fear of you upon all the land that you shall tread upon, as he hath spoken to you.
<br>Behold I set forth in your sight this day a blessing and a curse:
<br>A blessing, if you obey the commandments of the Lord your God, which I command you this day:
<br>A curse, if you obey not the command- ments of the Lord your God, but revolt from the way which now I shew you, and walk after strange gods which you know not.
<br>And when the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into the land, whither thou goest to dwell, thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Garizim, the curse upon mount Hebal:
<br>Which are beyond the Jordan, behind the way that goeth to the setting of the sun, in the land of the Chanaanite who dwelleth in the plain country over against Galgala, which is near the valley that reacheth and entereth far.
<br>For you shall pass over the Jordan, to pos- sess the land, which the Lord your God will give you, that you may have it and possess it.
<br>See therefore that you fulfil the ceremonies and judgments, which I shall set this day before you.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 12
<br>These are the precepts and judgments, that you must do in the land, which the Lord the God of thy fathers will give thee, to possess it all the days that thou shalt walk upon the earth.
<br>Destroy all the places in which the nations, that you shall possess, worshipped their gods upon high mountains, and hills, and under ev- ery shady tree:
<br>Overthrow their altars, and break down their statues, burn their groves with fire, and break their idols in pieces: destroy their names out of those places.
<br>You shall not do so to the Lord your God:
<br>But you shall come to the place, which the Lord your God shall choose out of all your tribes, to put his name there, and to dwell in it:
<br>And you shall offer in that place your holo- causts and victims, the tithes and firstfruits of your hands and your vows and gifts, the first- born of your herds and your sheep.
<br>And you shall eat there in the sight of the Lord your God: and you shall rejoice in all things, whereunto you shall put your hand, you and your houses wherein the Lord your God hath blessed you.
<br>You shall not do there the things we do here this day, every man that which seemeth good to himself.
<br>For until this present time you are not come to rest, and to the possession, which the Lord your God will give you.
<br>You shall pass over the Jordan, and shall dwell in the land which the Lord your God will give you, that you may have rest from all enemies round about: and may dwell without any fear,
<br>In the place, which the Lord your God shall choose, that his name may be therein. Thither shall you bring all the things that I command
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>you, holocausts, and victims, and tithes, and the firstfruits of your hands: and whatsoever is the choicest in the gifts which you shall vow to the Lord.
<br>There shall you feast before the Lord your God, you and your sons and your daughters, your menservants and maidservants, and the Levite that dwelleth in your cities. For he hath no other part and possession among you.
<br>Beware lest thou offer thy holocausts in every place that thou shalt see:
<br>But in the place which the Lord shall choose in one of thy tribes shalt thou offer sac- rifices, and shalt do all that I command thee.
<br>But if thou desirest to eat, and the eating of flesh delight thee, kill, and eat according to the blessing of the Lord thy God, which he hath given thee, in thy cities: whether it be unclean, that is to say, having blemish or defect: or clean, that is to say, sound and without blemish, such as may be offered, as the roe, and the hart, shalt thou eat it:
<br>Only the blood thou shalt not eat, but thou shalt pour it out upon the earth as water.
<br>Thou mayst not eat in thy towns the tithes of thy corn, and thy wine, and thy oil, the first- born of thy herds and thy cattle, nor any thing that thou vowest, and that thou wilt offer vol- untarily, and the firstfruits of thy hands:
<br>But thou shalt eat them before the Lord thy God in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose, thou and thy son and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and maidservant, and the Levite that dwelleth in thy cities: and thou shalt rejoice and be refreshed before the Lord thy God in all things, whereunto thou shalt put thy hand. 19 Take heed thou forsake not the Levite all
<br>the time that thou livest in the land.
<br>21 And if the place which the Lord thy God shall choose, that his name should be there, be
<br> 
<br>far off, thou shalt kill of thy herds and of thy flocks, as I have commanded thee, and shalt eat in thy towns, as it pleaseth thee.
<br>Even as the roe and the hart is eaten, so shalt thou eat them: both the clean and unclean shall eat of them alike.
<br>Only beware of this, that thou eat not the blood, for the blood is for the soul: and therefore thou must not eat the soul with the flesh:
<br>But thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water,
<br>That it may be well with thee and thy chil- dren after thee, when thou shalt do that which is pleasing in the sight of the Lord.
<br>But the things which thou hast sanctified and vowed to the Lord, thou shalt take, and shalt come to the place which the Lord shall choose:
<br>And shalt offer thy oblations, the flesh and the blood upon the altar of the Lord thy God: the blood of thy victims thou shalt pour on the altar: and the flesh thou thyself shalt eat.
<br>Observe and hear all the things that I com- mand thee, that it may be well with thee and thy children after thee for ever, when thou shalt do what is good and pleasing in the sight of the Lord thy God.
<br>When the Lord thy God shall have de- stroyed before thy face the nations, which thou shalt go in to possess, and when thou shalt pos- sess them, and dwell in their land:
<br>Beware lest thou imitate them, after they are destroyed at thy coming in, and lest thou seek after their ceremonies, saying: As these na- tions have worshipped their gods, so will I also worship.
<br>Thou shalt not do in like manner to the Lord thy God. For they have done to their gods all the abominations which the Lord abhorreth, offering their sons and daughters, and burning them with fire.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>What I command thee, that only do thou to the Lord: neither add any thing, nor diminish.
<br>
<br>Chapter 13
<br>If there rise in the midst of thee a prophet or one that saith he hath dreamed a dream, and he foretell a sign and a wonder,
<br>And that come to pass which he spoke, and he say to thee: Let us go and follow strange gods, which thou knowest not, and let us serve them:
<br>Thou shalt not hear the words of that prophet or dreamer: for the Lord your God tri- eth you, that it may appear whether you love him with all your heart, and with all your soul, or not.
<br>Follow the Lord your God, and fear him, and keep his commandments, and hear his voice: him you shall serve, and to him you shall cleave.
<br>And that prophet or forger of dreams shall be slain: because he spoke to draw you away from the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you from the house of bondage: to make thee go out of the way, which the Lord thy God commanded thee: and thou shalt take away the evil out of the midst of thee.
<br>If thy brother the son of thy mother, or thy son, or daughter, or thy wife that is in thy bo- som, or thy friend, whom thou lovest as thy own soul, would persuade thee secretly, saying: Let us go, and serve strange gods, which thou know- est not, nor thy fathers,
<br>Of all the nations round about, that are near or afar off, from one end of the earth to the other, 8 Consent not to him, hear him not, neither
<br>let thy eye spare him to pity and conceal him,
<br>But thou shalt presently put him to death. Let thy hand be first upon him, and afterwards
<br> 
<br>the hands of all the people.
<br>With stones shall he be stoned to death: because he would have withdrawn thee from the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage:
<br>That all Israel hearing may fear, and may do no more any thing like this.
<br>If in one of thy cities, which the Lord thy God shall give thee to dwell in, thou hear some say:
<br>Children of Belial are gone out of the midst of thee, and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city, and have said: Let us go, and serve strange gods which you know not:
<br>Inquire carefully and diligently, the truth of the thing by looking well into it, and if thou find that which is said to be certain, and that this abomination hath been really committed,
<br>Thou shalt forthwith kill the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, and shalt destroy it and all things that are in it, even the cattle.
<br>And all the household goods that are there, thou shalt gather together in the midst of the streets thereof, and shall burn them with the city itself, so as to comsume all for the Lord thy God, and that it be a heap for ever: it shall be built no more.
<br>And there shall nothing of that anathema stick to thy hand: that the Lord may turn from the wrath of his fury, and may have mercy on thee, and multiply thee as he swore to thy fa- thers,
<br>When thou shalt hear the voice of the Lord thy God, keeping all his precepts, which I com- mand thee this day, that thou mayst do what is pleasing in the sight of the Lord thy God.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 14
<br>
<br>Be ye children of the Lord your God: you shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness for the dead;
<br>Because thou art a holy people to the Lord thy God: and he chose thee to be his peculiar people of all nations that are upon the earth.
<br>Eat not the things that are unclean.
<br>These are the beasts that you shall eat, the ox, and the sheep, and the goat,
<br>The hart and the roe, the buffle, the chamois, the pygarg, the wild goat, the camelopardalus.
<br>Every beast that divideth the hoof in two parts, and cheweth the cud, you shall eat.
<br>But of them that chew the cud, but divide not the hoof, you shall not eat, such as the camel, the hare, and the cherogril: because they chew the cud, but divide not the hoof, they shall be unclean to you.
<br>The swine also, because it divideth the hoof, but cheweth not the cud, shall be unclean, their flesh you shall not eat, and their carcasses you shall not touch.
<br>These shall you eat of all that abide in the waters: All that have fins and scales, you shall eat.
<br>Such as are without fins and scales, you shall not eat, because they are unclean.
<br>All birds that are clean you shall eat.
<br>The unclean eat not: to wit, the eagle, and the grype, and the osprey,
<br>The ringtail, and the vulture, and the kite according to their kind:
<br>And all of the raven’s kind:
<br>And the ostrich, and the owl, and the larus, and the hawk according to its kind:
<br>The heron, and the swan, and the stork,
<br> 
<br>And the cormorant, the porphirion, and the night crow,
<br>The bittern, and the charadrion, every one in their kind: the houp also and the bat.
<br>Every thing that creepeth, and hath little wings, shall be unclean, and shall not be eaten.
<br>All that is clean, you shall eat.
<br>But whatsoever is dead of itself, eat not thereof.   Give it to the stranger, that is within thy gates, to eat, or sell it to him: because thou art the holy people of the Lord thy God. Thou shalt not boil a kid in the milk of his dam.
<br>Every year thou shalt set aside the tithes of all thy fruits that the earth bringeth forth,
<br>And thou shalt eat before the Lord thy God in the place which he shall choose, that his name may be called upon therein, the tithe of thy corn, and thy wine, and thy oil, and the firstborn of thy herds and thy sheep: that thou mayst learn to fear the Lord thy God at all times.
<br>But when the way and the place which the Lord thy God shall choose, are far off, and he hath blessed thee, and thou canst not carry all these things thither,
<br>Thou shalt sell them all, and turn them into money, and shalt carry it in thy hand, and shalt go to the place which the Lord shall choose: 26 And thou shalt buy with the same money whatsoever pleaseth thee, either of the herds or of sheep, wine also and strong drink, and all that thy soul desireth: and thou shalt eat be- fore the Lord thy God, and shalt feast, thou and
<br>thy house:
<br>And the Levite that is within thy gates, beware thou forsake him not, because he hath no other part in thy possession.
<br>The third year thou shalt separate another tithe of all things that grow to thee at that time, and shalt lay it up within thy gates.
<br>And the Levite that hath no other part
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>nor possession with thee, and the stranger and the fatherless and the widow, that are within thy gates, shall come and shall eat and be filled: that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all the works of thy hands that thou shalt do.
<br>
<br>Chapter 15
<br>In the seventh year thou shalt make a remission, 2 Which shall be celebrated in this order. He to whom any thing is owing from his friend or neighbour or brother, cannot demand it again,
<br>because it is the year of remission of the Lord.
<br>Of the foreigner or stranger thou mayst ex- act it: of thy countryman and neighbour thou shalt not have power to demand it again.
<br>And there shall be no poor nor beggar among you: that the Lord thy God may bless thee in the land which he will give thee in pos- session.
<br>Yet so if thou hear the voice of the Lord thy God, and keep all things that he hath ordained, and which I command thee this day, he will bless thee, as he hath promised.
<br>Thou shalt lend to many nations, and thou shalt borrow of no man. Thou shalt have do- minion over very many nations, and no one shall have dominion over thee.
<br>If one of thy brethren that dewlleth within thy gates of thy city in the land which the Lord thy God will give thee, come to poverty: thou shalt not harden thy heart, nor close thy hand,
<br>But shalt open it to the poor man, thou shalt lend him, that which thou perceivest he hath need of.
<br>Beware lest perhaps a wicked thought steal in upon thee, and thou say in thy heart: The seventh year of remission draweth nigh; and thou turn away thy eyes from thy poor brother, deny-
<br> 
<br>ing to lend him that which he asketh: lest he cry against thee to the Lord, and it become a sin unto thee.
<br>But thou shalt give to him: neither shalt thou do any thing craftily in relieving his neces- sities: that the Lord thy God may bless thee at all times, and in all things to which thou shalt put thy hand.
<br>There will not be wanting poor in the land of thy habitation: therefore I command thee to open thy hand to thy needy and poor brother, that liveth in the land.
<br>When thy brother a Hebrew man, or He- brew woman is sold to thee, and hath served thee six years, in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free:
<br>And when thou sendest him out free, thou shalt not let him go away empty:
<br>But shall give him for his way out of thy flocks, and out of thy barnfloor, and thy wine- press, wherewith the Lord thy God shall bless thee.
<br>Remember that thou also wast a bondser- vant in the land of Egypt, and the Lord thy God made thee free, and therefore I now command thee this.
<br>But if he say: I will not depart: because he loveth thee, and thy house, and findeth that he is well with thee:
<br>Thou shalt take an awl, and bore through his ear in the door of thy house, and he shall serve thee for ever: thou shalt do in like manner to thy womanservant also.
<br>Turn not away thy eyes from them when thou makest them free: because he hath served thee six years according to the wages of a hireling: that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all the works that thou dost.
<br>Of the firstlings, that come of thy herds and thy sheep, thou shalt sanctify to the Lord
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>thy God whatsoever is of the male sex. Thou shalt not work with the firstling of a bullock, and thou shalt not shear the firstlings of thy sheep.
<br>In the sight of the Lord thy God shalt thou eat them every year, in the place that the Lord shall choose, thou and thy house.
<br>But if it have a blemish, or be lame, or blind, or in any part disfigured or feeble, it shall not be sacrificed to the Lord thy God.
<br>But thou shalt eat it within the gates of thy city: the clean and the unclean shall eat them alike, as the roe and as the hart.
<br>Only thou shalt take heed not to eat their blood, but pour it out on the earth as water.
<br>
<br>Chapter 16
<br>Observe the month of new corn, which is the first of the spring, that thou mayst celebrate the phase to the Lord thy God: because in this month the Lord thy God brought thee out of Egypt by night.
<br>And thou shalt sacrifice the phase to the Lord thy God, of sheep, and of oxen, in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose, that his name may dwell there.
<br>Thou shalt not eat with it leavened bread: seven days shalt thou eat without leaven, the bread of affliction, because thou camest out of Egypt in fear: that thou mayst remember the day of thy coming out of Egypt, all the days of thy life.
<br>No leaven shall be seen in all thy coasts for seven days, neither shall any of the flesh of that which was sacrificed the first day in the evening remain until morning.
<br>Thou mayst not immolate the phase in any one of thy cities, which the Lord thy God will give thee:
<br> 
<br>But in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose, that his name may dwell there: thou shalt immolate the phase in the evening, at the going down of the sun, at which time thou camest out of Egypt.
<br>And thou shalt dress, and eat it in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose, and in the morning rising up thou shalt go into thy dwellings.
<br>Six days shalt thou eat unleavened bread: and on the seventh day, because it is the assem- bly of the Lord thy God, thou shalt do no work. 9 Thou shalt number unto thee seven weeks from that day, wherein thou didst put the sickle
<br>to the corn.
<br>And thou shalt celebrate the festival of weeks to the Lord thy God, a voluntary oblation of thy hand, which thou shalt offer according to the blessing of the Lord thy God.
<br>And thou shalt feast before the Lord thy God, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite that is within thy gates, and the stranger and the fatherless, and the widow, who abide with you: in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose, that his name may dwell there:
<br>And thou shalt remember that thou wast a servant in Egypt: and thou shalt keep and do the things that are commanded.
<br>Thou shalt celebrate the solemnity also of tabernacles seven days, when thou hast gathered in thy fruit of the barnfloor and of the winepress. 14 And thou shalt make merry in thy festi- val time, thou, thy son, and thy daughter, thy manservant, and thy maidservant, the Levite also and the stranger, and the fatherless and the
<br>widow that are within thy gates.
<br>Seven days shalt thou celebrate feasts to the Lord thy God in the place which the Lord shall choose: and the Lord thy God will belss
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>thee in all thy fruits, and in every work of thy hands, and thou shalt be in joy.
<br>Three times in a year shall all thy males ap- pear before the Lord thy God in the place which he shall choose: in the feast of unleavened bread, in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of taberna- cles. No one shall appear with his hands empty before the Lord:
<br>But every one shall offer according to what he hath, according to the blessing of the Lord his God, which he shall give him.
<br>Thou shalt appoint judges and magistrates in all thy gates, which the Lord thy God shall give thee, in all thy tribes: that they may judge the people with just judgment,
<br>And not go aside to either part. Thou shalt not accept person nor gifts: for gifts blind the eyes of the wise, and change the words of the just.
<br>Thou shalt follow justly after that which is just: that thou mayst live and possess the land, which the Lord thy God shall give thee.
<br>Thou shalt plant no grove, nor any tree near the altar of the Lord thy God:
<br>Neither shalt thou make nor set up to thy- self a statue: which things the Lord thy God hateth.
<br>
<br>Chapter 17
<br>Thou shalt not sacrifice to the Lord thy God a sheep, or an ox, wherein there is blemish, or any fault: for that is an abomination to the Lord thy God.
<br>When there shall be found among you within any of thy gates, which the Lord thy God shall give thee, man or woman that do evil in the sight of the Lord thy God, and transgress his covenant,
<br> 
<br>So as to go and serve strange gods, and adore them, the sun and the moon, and all the host of heaven, which I have not commanded:
<br>And this is told thee, and hearing it thou hast inquired diligently, and found it to be true, and that the abomination is committed in Israel:
<br>Thou shalt bring forth the man or the woman, who have committed that most wicked thing, to the gates of thy city, and they shall be stoned.
<br>By the mouth of two or three witnesses shall he die that is to be slain. Let no man be put to death, when only one beareth witness against him.
<br>The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to kill him, and afterwards the hands of the rest of the people: that thou mayst take away the evil out of the midst of thee.
<br>If thou perceive that there be among you a hard and doubtful matter in judgment between blood and blood, cause and cause, leprosy and leprosy: and thou see that the words of the judges within thy gates do vary: arise, and go up to the place, which the Lord thy God shall choose.
<br>And thou shalt come to the priests of the Levitical race, and to the judge, that shall be at that time: and thou shalt ask of them, and they shall shew thee the truth of the judgment.
<br>And thou shalt do whatsoever they shall say, that preside in the place, which the Lord shall choose, and what they shall teach thee,
<br>According to his law; and thou shalt follow their sentence: neither shalt thou decline to the right hand nor to the left hand.
<br>But he that will be proud, and refuse to obey the commandment of the priest, who min- istereth at that time to the Lord thy God, and the decree of the judge, that man shall die, and thou shalt take away the evil from Israel:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>And all the people hearing it shall fear, that no one afterwards swell with pride.
<br>When thou art come into the land, which the Lord thy God will give thee, and possessest it, and shalt say: I will set a king over me, as all nations have that are round about:
<br>Thou shalt set him whom the Lord thy God shall choose out of the number of thy brethren. Thou mayst not make a man of another nation king, that is not thy brother.
<br>And when he is made king, he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor lead back the peo- ple into Egypt, being lifted up with the number of his horsemen, especially since the Lord hath commanded you to return no more the same way. 17 He shall not have many wives, that may allure his mind, nor immense sums of silver and
<br>gold.
<br>But after he is raised to the throne of his kingdom, he shall copy out to himself the Deuteronomy of this law in a volume, taking the copy of the priests of the Levitical tribe,
<br>And he shall have it with him, and shall read it all the days of his life, that he may learn to fear the Lord his God, and keep his words and ceremonies, that are commanded in the law;
<br>And that his heart be not lifted up with pride over his brethren, nor decline to the right or to the left, that he and his sons may reign a long time over Israel.
<br>
<br>Chapter 18
<br>The priests and Levites, and all that are of the same tribe, shall have no part nor inheritance with the rest of Israel, because they shall eat the sacrifices of the Lord, and his oblations,
<br>2 And they shall receive nothing else of the possession of their brethren: for the Lord himself
<br> 
<br>is their inheritance, as he hath said to them.
<br>This shall be the priest’s due from the peo- ple, and from them that offer victims: whether they sacrifice an ox, or a sheep, they shall give to the priest the shoulder and the breast:
<br>The firstfruits also of corn, of wine, and of oil, and a part of the wool from the shearing of their sheep.
<br>For the Lord thy God hath chosen him of all thy tribes, to stand and to minister to the name of the Lord, him and his sons for ever.
<br>If a Levite go out of any one of the cities throughout all Israel, in which he dwelleth, and have a longing mind to come to the place which the Lord shall choose,
<br>He shall minister in the name of the Lord his God, as all his brethren the Levites do, that shall stand at that time before the Lord.
<br>He shall receive the same portion of food that the rest do: besides that which is due to him in his own city, by succession from his fathers.
<br>When thou art come into the land which the Lord thy God shall give thee, beware lest thou have a mind to imitate the abominations of those nations.
<br>Neither let there be found among you any one that shall expiate his son or daughter, mak- ing them to pass through the fire: or that con- sulteth soothsayers, or observeth dreams and omens, neither let there be any wizard,
<br>Nor charmer, nor any one that consul- teth pythonic spirits, or fortune tellers, or that seeketh the truth from the dead.
<br>For the Lord abhorreth all these things, and for these abominations he will destroy them at thy coming.
<br>Thou shalt be perfect, and without spot before the Lord thy God.
<br>These nations, whose land thou shalt pos- sess, hearken to soothsayers and diviners: but
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>thou art otherwise instructed by the Lord thy God.
<br>The Lord thy God will raise up to thee a PROPHET of thy nation and of thy brethren like unto me: him thou shalt hear:
<br>As thou desiredst of the Lord thy God in Horeb, when the assembly was gathered to- gether, and saidst: Let me not hear any more the voice of the Lord my God, neither let me see any more this exceeding great fire, lest I die.
<br>And the Lord said to me: They have spo- ken all things well.
<br>I will raise them up a prophet out of the midst of their brethren like to thee: and I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I shall command him.
<br>And he that will not hear his words, which he shall speak in my name, I will be the revenger. 20 But the prophet, who being corrupted with pride, shall speak in my name things that I did not command him to say, or in the name of
<br>strange gods, shall be slain.
<br>And if in silent thought thou answer: How shall I know the word that the Lord hath not spoken?
<br>Thou shalt have this sign: Whatsoever that same prophet foretelleth in the name of the Lord, and it cometh not to pass: that thing the Lord hath not spoken, but the prophet hath forged it by the pride of his mind: and therefore thou shalt not fear him.
<br>
<br>Chapter 19
<br>When the Lord thy God hath destroyed the na- tions, whose land he will deliver to thee, and thou shalt possess it, and shalt dwell in the cities and houses thereof:
<br>Thou shalt separate to thee three cities in
<br> 
<br>the midst of the land, which the Lord will give thee in possession,
<br>Paving diligently the way: and thou shalt divide the whole province of thy land equally into three parts: that he who is forced to flee for manslaughter, may have near at hand whither to escape.
<br>This shall be the law of the slayer that fleeth, whose life is to be saved: He that killeth his neighbor ignorantly, and who is proved to have had no hatred against him yesterday and the day before:
<br>But to have gone with him to the wood to hew wood, and in cutting down the tree the axe slipped out of his hand, and the iron slipping from the handle struck his friend, and killed him: he shall flee to one of the cities aforesaid, and live:
<br>Lest perhaps the next kinsman of him whose blood was shed, pushed on by his grief should pursue, and apprehend him, if the way be too long, and take away the life of him who is not guilty of death, because he is proved to have had no hatred before against him that was slain.
<br>Therefore I command thee, that thou sepa- rate three cities at equal distance one from an- other.
<br>And when the Lord thy God shall have en- larged thy borders, as he swore to the fathers, and shall give thee all the land that he promised them,
<br>(Yet so, if thou keep his commandments, and do the things which I command thee this day, that thou love the Lord thy God, and walk in his ways at all times) thou shalt add to thee other three cities, and shalt double the number of the three cities aforesaid:
<br>That innocent blood may not be shed in the midst of the land which the Lord thy God will give thee to possess, lest thou be guilty of
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>blood.
<br>But if any man hating his neighbour, lie in wait for his life, and rise and strike him, and he die, and he flee to one of the cities aforesaid,
<br>The ancients of his city shall send, and take him out of the place of refuge, and shall deliver him into the hand of the kinsman of him whose blood was shed, and he shall die.
<br>Thou shalt not pity him, and thou shalt take away the guilt of innocent blood out of Is- rael, that it may be well with thee.
<br>Thou shalt not take nor remove thy neigh- bour’s landmark, which thy predecessors have set in thy possession, which the Lord thy God will give thee in the land that thou shalt receive to possess.
<br>One witness shall not rise up against any man, whatsoever the sin or wickedness be: but in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word shall stand.
<br>If a lying witness stand against a man, ac- cusing him of transgression,
<br>Both of them, between whom the contro- versy is, shall stand before the Lord in the sight of the priests and the judges that shall be in those days.
<br>And when after most diligent inquisition, they shall find that the false witness hath told a lie against his brother:
<br>They shall render to him as he meant to do to his brother, and thou shalt take away the evil out of the midst of thee:
<br>That others hearing may fear, and may not dare to do such things.
<br>Thou shalt not pity him, but shalt require life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 20
<br>If thou go out to war against thy enemies, and see horsemen and chariots, and the numbers of the enemy’s army greater than thine, thou shalt not fear them: because the Lord thy God is with thee, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt. 2 And when the battle is now at hand, the priest shall stand before the army, and shall
<br>speak to the people in this manner:
<br>Hear, O Israel, you join battle this day against your enemies, let not your heart be dis- mayed, be not afraid, do not give back, fear ye them not:
<br>Because the Lord your God is in the midst of you, and will fight for you against your enemies, to deliver you from danger.
<br>And the captains shall proclaim through ev- ery band in the hearing of the army: What man is there, that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it.
<br>What man is there, that hath planted a vine- yard, and hath not as yet made it to be common, whereof all men may eat? let him go, and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and an- other man execute his office.
<br>What man is there, that hath espoused a wife, and not taken her? let him go, and return to his house, lest he die in the war, and another man take her.
<br>After these things are declared they shall add the rest, and shall speak to the people: What man is there that is fearful, and faint hearted?   let him go, and return to his house, lest he make the hearts of his brethren to fear, as he himself is possessed with fear.
<br>And when the captains of the army shall hold their peace, and have made an end of speak-
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>ing, every man shall prepare their bands to fight.
<br>If at any time thou come to fight against a city, thou shalt first offer it peace.
<br>If they receive it, and open the gates to thee, all the people that are therein, shall be saved, and shall serve thee paying tribute.
<br>But if they will not make peace, and shall begin war against thee, thou shalt besiege it.
<br>And when the Lord thy God shall deliver it into thy hands, thou shalt slay all that are therein of the male sex, with the edge of the sword,
<br>Excepting women and children, cattle and other things, that are in the city. And thou shalt divide all the prey to the army, and thou shalt eat the spoils of thy enemies, which the Lord thy God shall give thee.
<br>So shalt thou do to all cities that are at a great distance from thee, and are not of these cities which thou shalt receive in possession.
<br>But of those cities that shall be given thee, thou shalt suffer none at all to live:
<br>But shalt kill them with the edge of the sword, to wit, the Hethite, and the Amorrhite, and the Chanaanite, the Pherezite, and the Hevite, and the Jebusite, as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee:
<br>Lest they teach you to do all the abomi- nations which they have done to their gods: and you should sin against the Lord your God.
<br>When thou hast besieged a city a long time, and hath compassed it with bulwarks, to take it, thou shalt not cut down the trees that may be eaten of, neither shalt thou spoil the country round about with axes: for it is a tree, and not a man, neither can it increase the number of them that fight against thee.
<br>But if there be any trees that are not fruit- ful, but wild, and fit for other uses, cut them down, and make engines, until thou take the city,
<br> 
<br>which fighteth against thee.
<br>
<br>Chapter 21
<br>When there shall be found in the land, which the Lord thy God will give thee, the corpse of a man slain, and it is not known who is guilty of the murder,
<br>Thy ancients and judges shall go out, and shall measure from the place where the body li- eth the distance of every city round about:
<br>And the ancients of that city which they shall perceive to be nearer than the rest, shall take a heifer of the herd, that hath not drawn in the yoke, nor ploughed the ground,
<br>And they shall bring her into a rough and stony valley, that never was ploughed, nor sown: and there they shall strike off the head of the heifer:
<br>And the priests the sons of Levi shall come, whom the Lord thy God hath chosen to minister to him, and to bless in his name, and that by their word every matter should be decided, and whatsoever is clean or unclean should be judged. 6 And the ancients of that city shall come to the person slain, and shall wash their hands over
<br>the heifer that was killed in the valley,
<br>And shall say: Our hands did not shed this blood, nor did our eyes see it.
<br>Be merciful to thy people Israel, whom thou hast redeemed, O Lord, and lay not innocent blood to their charge, in the midst of thy people Israel. And the guilt of blood shall be taken from them:
<br>And thou shalt be free from the innocent’s blood, that was shed, when thou shalt have done what the Lord hath commanded thee.
<br>If thou go out to fight against thy ene- mies, and the Lord thy God deliver them  into
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>thy hand, and thou lead them away captives,
<br>And seest in the number of the captives a beautiful woman, and lovest her, and wilt have her to wife,
<br>Thou shalt bring her into thy house: and she shall shave her hair, and pare her nails,
<br>And shall put off the raiment, wherein she was taken: and shall remain in thy house, and mourn for her father and mother one month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and shalt sleep with her, and she shall be thy wife.
<br>But if afterwards she please thee not, thou shalt let her go free, but thou mayst not sell her for money nor oppress her by might because thou hast humbled her.
<br>If a man have two wives, one beloved, and the other hated, and they have had children by him, and the son of the hated be the firstborn,
<br>And he meaneth to divide his substance among his sons: he may not make the son of the beloved the firstborn, and prefer him before the son of the hated.
<br>But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the firstborn, and shall give him a double portion of all he hath: for this is the first of his children, and to him are due the first birthrights.
<br>If a man have a stubborn and unruly son, who will not hear the commandments of his fa- ther or mother, and being corrected, slighteth obedience:
<br>They shall take him and bring him to the ancients of the city, and to the gate of judgment, 20 And shall say to them: This our son is rebellious and stubborn, he slighteth hearing our admonitions, he giveth himself to revelling, and
<br>to debauchery and banquetings:
<br>21 The people of the city shall stone him: and he shall die, that you may take away the evil out of the midst of you, and all Israel hearing it may
<br> 
<br>be afraid.
<br>When a man hath committed a crime for which he is to be punished with death, and being condemned to die is hanged on a gibbet:
<br>His body shall not remain upon the tree, but shall be buried the same day: for he is ac- cursed of God that hangeth on a tree: and thou shalt not defile thy land, which the Lord thy God shall give thee in possession.
<br>
<br>Chapter 22
<br>Thou shalt not pass by if thou seest thy brother’s ox, or his sheep go astray: but thou shalt bring them back to thy brother.
<br>And if thy brother be not nigh, or thou know him not: thou shalt bring them to thy house, and they shall be with thee until thy brother seek them, and receive them.
<br>Thou shalt do in like manner with his ass, and with his raiment, and with every thing that is thy brother’s, which is lost: if thou find it, neglect it not as pertaining to another.
<br>If thou see thy brother’s ass or his ox to be fallen down in the way, thou shalt not slight it, but shalt lift it up with him.
<br>A woman shall not be clothed with man’s ap- parel, neither shall a man use woman’s apparel: for he that doth these things is abominable be- fore God.
<br>If thou find as thou walkest by the way, a bird’s nest in a tree, or on the ground, and the dam sitting upon the young or upon the eggs: thou shalt not take her with her young:
<br>But shalt let her go, keeping the young which thou hast caught: that it may be well with thee, and thou mayst live a long time.
<br>When thou buildest a new house, thou shalt make a battlement to the roof round about: lest
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>blood be shed in thy house, and thou be guilty, if any one slip, and fall down headlong.
<br>Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds: lest both the seed which thou hast sown, and the fruit of the vineyard, be sanctified to- gether.
<br>Thou shalt not plough with an ox and an ass together.
<br>Thou shalt not wear a garment that is wo- ven of woollen and linen together.
<br>Thou shalt make strings in the hem at the four corners of thy cloak, wherewith thou shalt be covered.
<br>If a man marry a wife, and afterwards hate her,
<br>And seek occasions to put her away, laying to her charge a very ill name, and say: I took this woman to wife, and going in to her, I found her not a virgin:
<br>Her father and mother shall take her, and shall bring with them the tokens of her virginity to the ancients of the city that are in the gate:
<br>And the father shall say: I gave my daugh- ter unto this man to wife: and because he hateth her,
<br>He layeth to her charge a very ill name, so as to say: I found not thy daughter a virgin: and behold these are the tokens of my daughter’s virginity. And they shall spread the cloth before the ancients of the city:
<br>And the ancients of that city shall take that man, and beat him,
<br>Condemning him besides in a hundred sicles of silver, which he shall give to the damsel’s father, because he hath defamed by a very ill name a virgin of Israel: and he shall have her to wife, and may not put her away all the days of his life.
<br>But if what he charged her with be true, and virginity be not found in the damsel:
<br> 
<br>They shall cast her out of the doors of her father’s house, and the men of the city shall stone her to death, and she shall die: because she hath done a wicked thing in Israel, to play the whore in her father’s house: and thou shalt take away the evil out of the midst of thee.
<br>If a man lie with another man’s wife, they shall both die, that is to say, the adulterer and the adulteress: and thou shalt take away the evil out of Israel.
<br>If a man have espoused a damsel that is a virgin, and some one find her in the city, and lie with her,
<br>Thou shalt bring them both out to the gate of that city, and they shall be stoned: the damsel, because she cried not out, being in the city: the man, because he hath humbled his neighbour’s wife. And thou shalt take away the evil from the midst of thee.
<br>But if a man find a damsel that is be- trothed, in the field, and taking hold of her, lie with her, he alone shall die:
<br>The damsel shall suffer nothing, neither is she guilty of death: for as a robber riseth against his brother, and taketh away his life, so also did the damsel suffer:
<br>She was alone in the field: she cried, and there was no man to help her.
<br>If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, who is not espoused, and taking her, lie with her, and the matter come to judgment:
<br>He that lay with her shall give to the father of the maid fifty sicles of silver, and shall have her to wife, because he hath humbled her: he may not put her away all the days of his life.
<br>No man shall take his father’s wife, nor remove his covering.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 23
<br>An eunuch, whose testicles are broken or cut away, or yard cut off, shall not enter into the church of the Lord.
<br>A mamzer, that is to say, one born of a pros- titute, shall not enter into the church of the Lord, until the tenth generation.
<br>The Ammonite and the Moabite, even af- ter the tenth generation shall not enter into the church of the Lord for ever:
<br>Because they would not meet you with bread and water in the way, when you came out of Egypt: and because they hired against thee Bal- aam, the son of Beor, from Mesopotamia in Syria, to curse thee.
<br>And the Lord thy God would not hear Bal- aam, and he turned his cursing into thy blessing, because he loved thee.
<br>Thou shalt not make peace with them, nei- ther shalt thou seek their prosperity all the days of thy life for ever.
<br>Thou shalt not abhor the Edomite, because he is thy brother: nor the Egyptian, because thou wast a stranger in his land.
<br>They that are born of them, in the third gen- eration shall enter into the church of the Lord.
<br>When thou goest out to war against thy en- emies, thou shalt keep thyself from every evil thing.
<br>If there be among you any man, that is defiled in a dream by night, he shall go forth out of the camp,
<br>And shall not return, before he be washed with water in the evening: and after sunset he shall return into the camp.
<br>Thou shalt have a place without the camp, to which thou mayst go for the necessities of na- ture,
<br>Carrying a paddle at thy girdle. And when
<br> 
<br>thou sittest down, thou shalt dig round about, and with the earth that is dug up thou shalt cover
<br>That which thou art eased of: (for the Lord thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp, to deliver thee, and to give up thy enemies to thee:) and let thy camp be holy, and let no uncleanness appear therein, lest he go away from thee.
<br>Thou shalt not deliver to his master the servant that is fled to thee.
<br>He shall dwell with thee in the place that shall please him, and shall rest in one of thy cities: give him no trouble.
<br>There shall be no whore among the daugh- ters of Israel, nor whoremonger among the sons of Israel.
<br>Thou shalt not offer the hire of a strumpet, nor the price of a dog, in the house of the Lord thy God, whatsoever it be that thou hast vowed: because both these are an abomination to the Lord thy God.
<br>Thou shalt not lend to thy brother money to usury, nor corn, nor any other thing:
<br>But to the stranger. To thy brother thou shalt lend that which he wanteth, without usury: that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all thy works in the land, which thou shalt go in to pos- sess.
<br>When thou hast made a vow to the Lord thy God, thou shalt not delay to pay it: because the Lord thy God will require it. And if thou delay, it shall be imputed to thee for a sin.
<br>If thou wilt not promise, that shalt be with- out sin.
<br>But that which is once gone out of thy lips, thou shalt observe, and shalt do as thou hast promised to the Lord thy God, and hast spoken with thy own will and with thy own mouth.
<br>Going into thy neighbour’s vineyard, thou mayst eat as many grapes as thou pleasest: but
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>must carry none out with thee:
<br>If thou go into thy friend’s corn, thou mayst break the ears, and rub them in thy hand: but not reap them with a sickle.
<br>
<br>Chapter 24
<br>
<br>If a man take a wife, and have her, and she find not favour in his eyes, for some uncleanness: he shall write a bill of divorce, and shall give it in her hand, and send her out of his house.
<br>And when she is departed, and marrieth an- other husband,
<br>And he also hateth her, and hath given her a bill of divorce, and hath sent her out of his house or is dead:
<br>The former husband cannot take her again to wife: because she is defiled, and is become abominable before the Lord: lest thou cause thy land to sin, which the Lord thy God shall give thee to possess.
<br>When a man hath lately taken a wife, he shall not go out to war, neither shall any public business be enjoined him, but he shall be free at home without fault, that for one year he may rejoice with his wife.
<br>Thou shalt not take the nether, nor the up- per millstone to pledge: for he hath pledged his life to thee.
