<br>§4101. Congressional findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) the Federal Government has a responsibility to promote the general welfare of the Nation—
<br>
<br>(A) by using Federal resources to aid families and individuals seeking affordable homes in safe and healthy environments and, in particular, assisting responsible, deserving citizens who cannot provide fully for themselves because of temporary circumstances or factors beyond their control;
<br>
<br>(B) by working to ensure a thriving national economy and a strong private housing market; and
<br>
<br>(C) by developing effective partnerships among the Federal Government, State, tribal, and local governments, and private entities that allow government to accept responsibility for fostering the development of a healthy marketplace and allow families to prosper without government involvement in their day-to-day activities;
<br>
<br>(2) there exists a unique relationship between the Government of the United States and the governments of Indian tribes and a unique Federal responsibility to Indian people;
<br>
<br>(3) the Constitution of the United States invests the Congress with plenary power over the field of Indian affairs, and through treaties, statutes, and historical relations with Indian tribes, the United States has undertaken a unique trust responsibility to protect and support Indian tribes and Indian people;
<br>
<br>(4) the Congress, through treaties, statutes, and the general course of dealing with Indian tribes, has assumed a trust responsibility for the protection and preservation of Indian tribes and for working with tribes and their members to improve their housing conditions and socioeconomic status so that they are able to take greater responsibility for their own economic condition;
<br>
<br>(5) providing affordable homes in safe and healthy environments is an essential element in the special role of the United States in helping tribes and their members to improve their housing conditions and socioeconomic status;
<br>
<br>(6) the need for affordable homes in safe and healthy environments on Indian reservations, in Indian communities, and in Native Alaskan villages is acute and the Federal Government shall work not only to provide housing assistance, but also, to the extent practicable, to assist in the development of private housing finance mechanisms on Indian lands to achieve the goals of economic self-sufficiency and self-determination for tribes and their members; and
<br>
<br>(7) Federal assistance to meet these responsibilities shall be provided in a manner that recognizes the right of Indian self-determination and tribal self-governance by making such assistance available directly to the Indian tribes or tribally designated entities under authorities similar to those accorded Indian tribes in Public Law 93–638 (25 U.S.C. 450 et seq.).1

<br>§4111. Block grants
<br>(a) Authority
<br>(1) In general

<br>For each fiscal year, the Secretary shall (to the extent amounts are made available to carry out this chapter) make grants under this section on behalf of Indian tribes—
<br>
<br>(A) to carry out affordable housing activities under part A of subchapter II; and
<br>
<br>(B) to carry out self-determined housing activities for tribal communities programs under part B of that subchapter.
<br>(2) Provision of amounts
<br>
<br>Under such a grant on behalf of an Indian tribe, the Secretary shall provide the grant amounts for the tribe directly to the recipient for the tribe.
<br>(b) Plan requirement
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary may make a grant under this chapter on behalf of an Indian tribe for a fiscal year only if—
<br>
<br>(A) the Indian tribe has submitted to the Secretary an Indian housing plan for such fiscal year under section 4112 of this title; and
<br>
<br>(B) the plan has been determined under section 4113 of this title to comply with the requirements of section 4112 of this title.
<br>(2) Waiver
<br>
<br>The Secretary may waive the applicability of the requirements under paragraph (1), in whole or in part, for a period of not more than 90 days, if the Secretary determines that an Indian tribe has not complied with, or is unable to comply with, those requirements due to exigent circumstances beyond the control of the Indian tribe.
<br>(c) Local cooperation agreement
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, grant amounts provided under this chapter on behalf of an Indian tribe may not be used for rental or lease-purchase homeownership units that are owned by the recipient for the tribe unless the governing body of the locality within which the property subject to the development activities to be assisted with the grant amounts is or will be situated has entered into an agreement with the recipient for the tribe providing for local cooperation required by the Secretary pursuant to this chapter. The Secretary may waive the requirements of this subsection and subsection (d) if the recipient has made a good faith effort to fulfill the requirements of this subsection and subsection (d) and agrees to make payments in lieu of taxes to the appropriate taxing authority in an amount consistent with the requirements of subsection (d)(2) until such time as the matter of making such payments has been resolved in accordance with subsection (d).
<br>(d) Exemption from taxation
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, grant amounts provided under this chapter on behalf of an Indian tribe may not be used for affordable housing activities under this chapter for rental or lease-purchase dwelling units developed under the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.) or with amounts provided under this chapter that are owned by the recipient for the tribe unless—
<br>
<br>(1) such dwelling units (which, in the case of units in a multi-unit project, shall be exclusive of any portions of the project not developed under the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.] or with amounts provided under this chapter) are exempt from all real and personal property taxes levied or imposed by any State, tribe, city, county, or other political subdivision; and
<br>
<br>(2) the recipient for the tribe makes annual payments of user fees to compensate such governments for the costs of providing governmental services, including police and fire protection, roads, water and sewerage systems, utilities systems and related facilities, or payments in lieu of taxes to such taxing authority, in an amount equal to the greater of $150 per dwelling unit or 10 percent of the difference between the shelter rent and the utility cost, or such lesser amount as—
<br>
<br>(A) is prescribed by State, tribal, or local law;
<br>
<br>(B) is agreed to by the local governing body in the agreement under subsection (c); or
<br>
<br>(C) the recipient and the local governing body agree that such user fees or payments in lieu of taxes shall not be made.
<br>(e) Effect of failure to exempt from taxation
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding subsection (d), a grant recipient that does not comply with the requirements under such subsection may receive a block grant under this chapter, but only if the tribe, State, city, county, or other political subdivision in which the affordable housing development is located contributes, in the form of cash or tax remission, the amount by which the taxes paid with respect to the development exceed the amounts prescribed in subsection (d)(2).
<br>(f) Amount
<br>
<br>Except as otherwise provided under this chapter, the amount of a grant under this section to a recipient for a fiscal year shall be—

<br>(2) in the case of a recipient whose grant beneficiary is more than 1 Indian tribe, the sum of the amounts of the allocations under section 4151 of this title for each such Indian tribe.
<br>(g) Use for affordable housing activities under plan
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subsection (h) of this section and part B of subchapter II, amounts provided under a grant under this section may be used only for affordable housing activities under subchapter II that are consistent with an Indian housing plan approved under section 4113 of this title.
<br>(h) Administrative and planning expenses
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall, by regulation, authorize each recipient to use a percentage of any grant amounts received under this chapter for comprehensive housing and community development planning activities and for any reasonable administrative and planning expenses of the recipient relating to carrying out this chapter and activities assisted with such amounts, which may include costs for salaries of individuals engaged in administering and managing affordable housing activities assisted with grant amounts provided under this chapter and expenses of preparing an Indian housing plan under section 4112 of this title.
<br>(i) Public-private partnerships
<br>
<br>Each recipient shall make all reasonable efforts, consistent with the purposes of this chapter, to maximize participation by the private sector, including nonprofit organizations and for-profit entities, in implementing the approved Indian housing plan.
<br>(j) Federal supply sources
<br>
<br>For purposes of section 501 of title 40, on election by the applicable Indian tribe—
<br>
<br>(1) each Indian tribe or tribally designated housing entity shall be considered to be an Executive agency in carrying out any program, service, or other activity under this chapter; and
<br>
<br>(2) each Indian tribe or tribally designated housing entity and each employee of the Indian tribe or tribally designated housing entity shall have access to sources of supply on the same basis as employees of an Executive agency.

The Secretary shall have the discretion to review a plan only to the extent that the Secretary considers review is necessary.
<br>(2) Notice
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall notify each Indian tribe for which a plan is submitted and any tribally designated housing entity for the tribe whether the plan complies with such requirements not later than 60 days after receiving the plan. If the Secretary does not notify the Indian tribe, as required under this subsection and subsection (b), the plan shall be considered, for purposes of this chapter, to have been determined to comply with the requirements under section 4112 of this title and the tribe shall be considered to have been notified of compliance upon the expiration of such 60-day period.
<br>(b) Notice of reasons for determination of noncompliance

<br>
<br>After submission of the Indian housing plan or any amendment or modification to the plan to the Secretary, to the extent that the Secretary considers such action to be necessary to make determinations under this subsection, the Secretary shall review the plan (including any amendments or modifications thereto) to determine whether the contents of the plan—
<br>

<br>
<br>(2) are consistent with information and data available to the Secretary; and

<br>If the Secretary determines that any of the appropriate certifications required under section 4112(c)(5) 1 of this title are not included in the plan, the plan shall be deemed to be incomplete.
<br>(d) Updates to plan
<br>
<br>After a plan under section 4112 of this title has been submitted for an Indian tribe for any tribal program year, the tribe may comply with the provisions of such section for any succeeding tribal program year by submitting only such information regarding such changes as may be necessary to update the plan previously submitted.
<br>(e) Self-determined activities program
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Secretary—
<br>
<br>(1) shall review the information included in an Indian housing plan pursuant to subsections (b)(4) 2 and (c)(7) 3 only to determine whether the information is included for purposes of compliance with the requirement under section 4145a(b)(2) 4 of this title; and

<br>(4) Exclusion from program income of regular developer's fees for low-income housing tax credit projects
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, any income derived from a regular and customary developer's fee for any project that receives a low-income housing tax credit under section 42 of title 26, and that is initially funded using a grant provided under this chapter, shall not be considered to be program income if the developer's fee is approved by the State housing credit agency.
<br>(b) Labor standards

<br>
<br>Any contract or agreement for assistance, sale, or lease pursuant to this chapter shall contain a provision requiring that not less than the wages prevailing in the locality, as determined or adopted (subsequent to a determination under applicable State, tribal, or local law) by the Secretary, shall be paid to all architects, technical engineers, draftsmen, and technicians employed in the development, and all maintenance laborers and mechanics employed in the operation, of the affordable housing project involved; and shall also contain a provision that not less than the wages prevailing in the locality, as predetermined by the Secretary of Labor pursuant to sections 3141–3144, 3146, and 3147 of title 40, shall be paid to all laborers and mechanics employed in the development of the affordable housing involved, and the Secretary shall require certification as to compliance with the provisions of this paragraph before making any payment under such contract or agreement.

<br>(3) Application of tribal laws
<br>
<br>Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any contract or agreement for assistance, sale, or lease pursuant to this chapter, if such contract or agreement is otherwise covered by one or more laws or regulations adopted by an Indian tribe that requires the payment of not less than prevailing wages, as determined by the Indian tribe.

<br>
<br>The Secretary shall approve the release of funds subject to the procedures authorized by this section only if, not less than 15 days prior to such approval and prior to any commitment of funds to such projects, the tribe has submitted to the Secretary a request for such release accompanied by a certification that meets the requirements of subsection (c). The approval of the Secretary of any such certification shall be deemed to satisfy the responsibilities of the Secretary under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 [42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.] and such other provisions of law as the regulations of the Secretary specify insofar as those responsibilities relate to the releases of funds for projects to be carried out pursuant thereto that are covered by such certification.

<br>
<br>(2) does not threaten the health or safety of the community involved by posing an immediate or long-term hazard to residents of that community;

<br>(3) is a result of inadvertent error, including an incorrect or incomplete certification provided under subsection (c)(1); and

<br>
<br>(4) to plan for and integrate infrastructure resources for Indian tribes with housing development for tribes; and
<br>
<br>(5) to promote the development of private capital markets in Indian country and to allow such markets to operate and grow, thereby benefiting Indian communities.
<br>(b) Eligible families
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided under paragraphs (2) and (4), and except with respect to loan guarantees under the demonstration program under subchapter VI, assistance under eligible housing activities under this chapter shall be limited to low-income Indian families on Indian reservations and other Indian areas.

<br>
<br>Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a recipient may provide housing or housing assistance through affordable housing activities for which a grant is provided under this chapter to any family that is not a low-income family, to the extent that the Secretary approves the activities due to a need for housing for those families that cannot reasonably be met without that assistance.

<br>Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a recipient may provide housing or housing assistance provided through affordable housing activities assisted with grant amounts under this chapter for a family on an Indian reservation or other Indian area if the recipient determines that the presence of the family on the Indian reservation or other Indian area is essential to the well-being of Indian families and the need for housing for the family cannot reasonably be met without such assistance.
<br>(4) Law enforcement officers
<br>
<br>A recipient may provide housing or housing assistance provided through affordable housing activities assisted with grant amounts under this chapter for a law enforcement officer on an Indian reservation or other Indian area, if—
<br>

<br>(6) 1 Preference for tribal members and other Indian families
<br>
<br>The Indian housing plan for an Indian tribe may require preference, for housing or housing assistance provided through affordable housing activities assisted with grant amounts provided under this chapter on behalf of such tribe, to be given (to the extent practicable) to Indian families who are members of such tribe, or to other Indian families. In any case in which the applicable Indian housing plan for an Indian tribe provides for preference under this paragraph, the recipient for the tribe shall ensure that housing activities that are assisted with grant amounts under this chapter for such tribe are subject to such preference.
