<br>
<br>Pub. L. 116–283, div. F, title LXII, §6205, Jan. 1, 2021, 134 Stat. 4570, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(a) Review of Thresholds for Certain Currency Transaction Reports and Suspicious Activity Reports.—The Secretary [of the Treasury], in consultation with the Attorney General, the Director of National Intelligence, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Federal functional regulators, State bank supervisors, State credit union supervisors, and other relevant stakeholders, shall review and determine whether the dollar thresholds, including aggregate thresholds, under sections 5313, 5318(g), and 5331 of title 31, United States Code, including regulations issued under those sections, should be adjusted.
<br>
<br>"(b) Considerations.—In making the determinations required under subsection (a), the Secretary, in consultation with the Attorney General, the Director of National Intelligence, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Federal functional regulators, State bank supervisors, State credit union supervisors, and other relevant stakeholders, shall—
<br>
<br>"(1) rely substantially on information obtained through the BSA Data Value Analysis Project conducted by FinCEN [Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Department of the Treasury] and on information obtained through the Currency Transaction Report analyses conducted by the Comptroller General of the United States; and
<br>
<br>"(2) consider—
<br>
<br>"(A) the effects that adjusting the thresholds would have on law enforcement, intelligence, national security, and homeland security agencies;
<br>
<br>"(B) the costs likely to be incurred or saved by financial institutions from any adjustment to the thresholds;
<br>
<br>"(C) whether adjusting the thresholds would better conform the United States with international norms and standards to counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism;
<br>
<br>"(D) whether currency transaction report thresholds should be tied to inflation or otherwise be adjusted based on other factors consistent with the purposes of the Bank Secrecy Act;
<br>
<br>"(E) any other matter that the Secretary determines is appropriate.
<br>
<br>"(c) Report and Rulemakings.—Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act [Jan. 1, 2021], the Secretary, in consultation with the Attorney General, the Director of National Intelligence, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Federal functional regulators, State bank supervisors, State credit union supervisors, and other relevant stakeholders, shall—
<br>
<br>"(1) publish a report of the findings from the review required under subsection (a); and
<br>
<br>"(2) propose rulemakings, as appropriate, to implement the findings and determinations described in paragraph (1).
<br>
<br>"(d) Updates.—Not less frequently than once every 5 years during the 10-year period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall—
<br>
<br>"(1) evaluate findings and rulemakings described in subsection (c); and
<br>
<br>"(2) transmit a written summary of the evaluation to the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate; and
<br>
<br>"(3) propose rulemakings, as appropriate, in response to the evaluation required under paragraph (1)."

<br>Efficient Use of Currency Transaction Report System
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 107–56, title III, §366, Oct. 26, 2001, 115 Stat. 335, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(a) Findings.—The Congress finds the following:
<br>
<br>"(1) The Congress established the currency transaction reporting requirements in 1970 because the Congress found then that such reports have a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, and regulatory investigations and proceedings and the usefulness of such reports has only increased in the years since the requirements were established.
<br>
<br>"(2) In 1994, in response to reports and testimony that excess amounts of currency transaction reports were interfering with effective law enforcement, the Congress reformed the currency transaction report exemption requirements to provide—
<br>
<br>"(A) mandatory exemptions for certain reports that had little usefulness for law enforcement, such as cash transfers between depository institutions and cash deposits from government agencies; and
<br>
<br>"(B) discretionary authority for the Secretary of the Treasury to provide exemptions, subject to criteria and guidelines established by the Secretary, for financial institutions with regard to regular business customers that maintain accounts at an institution into which frequent cash deposits are made.
<br>
<br>"(3) Today there is evidence that some financial institutions are not utilizing the exemption system, or are filing reports even if there is an exemption in effect, with the result that the volume of currency transaction reports is once again interfering with effective law enforcement.
<br>
<br>"(b) Study and Report.—
<br>
<br>"(1) Study required.—The Secretary shall conduct a study of—
<br>
<br>"(A) the possible expansion of the statutory exemption system in effect under section 5313 of title 31, United States Code; and
<br>
<br>"(B) methods for improving financial institution utilization of the statutory exemption provisions as a way of reducing the submission of currency transaction reports that have little or no value for law enforcement purposes, including improvements in the systems in effect at financial institutions for regular review of the exemption procedures used at the institution and the training of personnel in its effective use.
<br>
<br>"(2) Report required.—The Secretary of the Treasury shall submit a report to the Congress before the end of the 1-year period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act [Oct. 26, 2001] containing the findings and conclusions of the Secretary with regard to the study required under subsection (a), and such recommendations for legislative or administrative action as the Secretary determines to be appropriate."
<br>Report Reduction Goal; Streamlined Currency Transaction Reports
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 103–325, title IV, §402(b), (c), Sept. 23, 1994, 108 Stat. 2245, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(b) Report Reduction Goal; Reports.—
<br>
<br>"(1) In general.—In implementing the amendment made by subsection (a) [amending this section], the Secretary of the Treasury shall seek to reduce, within a reasonable period of time, the number of reports required to be filed in the aggregate by depository institutions pursuant to section 5313(a) of title 31, United States Code, by at least 30 percent of the number filed during the year preceding the date of enactment of this Act [Sept. 23, 1994].
<br>
<br>"(2) Interim report.—The Secretary of the Treasury shall submit a report to the Congress not later than the end of the 180-day period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act on the progress made by the Secretary in implementing the amendment made by subsection (a).
<br>
<br>"(3) Annual report.—The Secretary of the Treasury shall submit an annual report to the Congress after the end of each of the first 5 calendar years which begin after the date of enactment of this Act on the extent to which the Secretary has reduced the overall number of currency transaction reports filed with the Secretary pursuant to section 5313(a) of title 31, United States Code, consistent with the purposes of such section and effective law enforcement.
<br>
<br>"(c) Streamlined Currency Transaction Reports.—The Secretary of the Treasury shall take such action as may be appropriate to—
<br>
<br>"(1) redesign the format of reports required to be filed under section 5313(a) of title 31, United States Code, by any financial institution (as defined in section 5312(a)(2) of such title) to eliminate the need to report information which has little or no value for law enforcement purposes; and
<br>
<br>"(2) reduce the time and effort required to prepare such report for filing by any such financial institution under such section."

<br>§5314. Records and reports on foreign financial agency transactions
<br>
<br>(a) Considering the need to avoid impeding or controlling the export or import of monetary instruments and the need to avoid burdening unreasonably a person making a transaction with a foreign financial agency, the Secretary of the Treasury shall require a resident or citizen of the United States or a person in, and doing business in, the United States, to keep records, file reports, or keep records and file reports, when the resident, citizen, or person makes a transaction or maintains a relation for any person with a foreign financial agency. The records and reports shall contain the following information in the way and to the extent the Secretary prescribes:
<br>
<br>(1) the identity and address of participants in a transaction or relationship.
<br>
<br>(2) the legal capacity in which a participant is acting.
<br>
<br>(3) the identity of real parties in interest.
<br>
<br>(4) a description of the transaction.
<br>
<br>(b) The Secretary may prescribe—
<br>
<br>(1) a reasonable classification of persons subject to or exempt from a requirement under this section or a regulation under this section;
<br>
<br>(2) a foreign country to which a requirement or a regulation under this section applies if the Secretary decides applying the requirement or regulation to all foreign countries is unnecessary or undesirable;
<br>
<br>(3) the magnitude of transactions subject to a requirement or a regulation under this section;
<br>
<br>(4) the kind of transaction subject to or exempt from a requirement or a regulation under this section; and
<br>
<br>(5) other matters the Secretary considers necessary to carry out this section or a regulation under this section.
<br>
<br>(c) A person shall be required to disclose a record required to be kept under this section or under a regulation under this section only as required by law.

<br>
<br>(i) Property derived from an illegal source.—Property may only be seized by the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to subparagraph (A) by reason of a claimed violation of section 5324 if the property to be seized was derived from an illegal source or the funds were structured for the purpose of concealing the violation of a criminal law or regulation other than section 5324.
<br>
<br>(ii) Notice.—Not later than 30 days after property is seized by the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to subparagraph (A), the Internal Revenue Service shall—
<br>
<br>(I) make a good faith effort to find all persons with an ownership interest in such property; and
<br>
<br>(II) provide each such person so found with a notice of the seizure and of the person's rights under clause (iv).

<br>
<br>(ii) no current or former officer or employee of or contractor for the Federal Government or of or for any State, local, tribal, or territorial government within the United States, who has any knowledge that such report was made may disclose to any person involved in the transaction that the transaction has been reported, or otherwise reveal any information that would reveal that the transaction has been reported, other than as necessary to fulfill the official duties of such officer or employee.

<br>
<br>(B) Rule of construction.—Subparagraph (A) shall not be construed as creating—

<br>
<br>(ii) any immunity against, or otherwise affecting, any civil or criminal action brought by any government or agency of government to enforce any constitution, law, or regulation of such government or agency.
<br>

<br>
<br>(C) Coordination with other reporting requirements.—Subparagraph (A) shall not be construed as precluding any supervisory agency for any financial institution from requiring the financial institution to submit any information or report to the agency or another agency pursuant to any other applicable provision of law.

<br>
<br>(i) the national priorities established by the Secretary;
<br>
<br>(ii) the purposes described in section 5311; and
<br>
<br>(iii) the means by or form in which the Secretary shall receive such reporting, including the burdens imposed by such means or form of reporting on persons required to provide such reporting, the efficiency of the means or form, and the benefits derived by the means or form of reporting by Federal law enforcement agencies and the intelligence community in countering financial crime, including money laundering and the financing of terrorism.
<br>
<br>(C) Compliance program.—Reports filed under this subsection shall be guided by the compliance program of a covered financial institution with respect to the Bank Secrecy Act, including the risk assessment processes of the covered institution that should include a consideration of priorities established by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 5318.

<br>
<br>(I) establish streamlined, including automated, processes to, as appropriate, permit the filing of noncomplex categories of reports that—
<br>

<br>(A) the development of internal policies, procedures, and controls;
<br>
<br>(B) the designation of a compliance officer;
<br>
<br>(C) an ongoing employee training program; and

<br>(2) Regulations.—
<br>
<br>(A) In general.—The Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the appropriate Federal functional regulator (as defined in section 509 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act), may prescribe minimum standards for programs established under paragraph (1), and may exempt from the application of those standards any financial institution that is not subject to the provisions of the rules contained in part 103 of title 31, of the Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor rule thereto, for so long as such financial institution is not subject to the provisions of such rules.
<br>
<br>(B) Factors.—In prescribing the minimum standards under subparagraph (A), and in supervising and examining compliance with those standards, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the appropriate Federal functional regulator (as defined in section 509 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (12 U.S.C. 6809)) shall take into account the following:
<br>
<br>(i) Financial institutions are spending private compliance funds for a public and private benefit, including protecting the United States financial system from illicit finance risks.
<br>
<br>(ii) The extension of financial services to the underbanked and the facilitation of financial transactions, including remittances, coming from the United States and abroad in ways that simultaneously prevent criminal persons from abusing formal or informal financial services networks are key policy goals of the United States.
<br>
<br>(iii) Effective anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism programs safeguard national security and generate significant public benefits by preventing the flow of illicit funds in the financial system and by assisting law enforcement and national security agencies with the identification and prosecution of persons attempting to launder money and undertake other illicit activity through the financial system.
<br>
<br>(iv) Anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism programs described in paragraph (1) should be—
<br>
<br>(I) reasonably designed to assure and monitor compliance with the requirements of this subchapter and regulations promulgated under this subchapter; and
<br>
<br>(II) risk-based, including ensuring that more attention and resources of financial institutions should be directed toward higher-risk customers and activities, consistent with the risk profile of a financial institution, rather than toward lower-risk customers and activities.
<br>
<br>(3) Concentration accounts.—The Secretary may prescribe regulations under this subsection that govern maintenance of concentration accounts by financial institutions, in order to ensure that such accounts are not used to prevent association of the identity of an individual customer with the movement of funds of which the customer is the direct or beneficial owner, which regulations shall, at a minimum—
<br>
<br>(A) prohibit financial institutions from allowing clients to direct transactions that move their funds into, out of, or through the concentration accounts of the financial institution;
<br>
<br>(B) prohibit financial institutions and their employees from informing customers of the existence of, or the means of identifying, the concentration accounts of the institution; and
<br>
<br>(C) require each financial institution to establish written procedures governing the documentation of all transactions involving a concentration account, which procedures shall ensure that, any time a transaction involving a concentration account commingles funds belonging to 1 or more customers, the identity of, and specific amount belonging to, each customer is documented.
<br>

<br>
<br>(A) In general.—Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this paragraph, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Attorney General, Federal functional regulators (as defined in section 509 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (15 U.S.C. 6809)), relevant State financial regulators, and relevant national security agencies, shall establish and make public priorities for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism policy.
<br>
<br>(B) Updates.—Not less frequently than once every 4 years, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Attorney General, Federal functional regulators (as defined in section 509 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (15 U.S.C. 6809)), relevant State financial regulators, and relevant national security agencies, shall update the priorities established under subparagraph (A).
<br>
<br>(C) Relation to national strategy.—The Secretary of the Treasury shall ensure that the priorities established under subparagraph (A) are consistent with the national strategy for countering the financing of terrorism and related forms of illicit finance developed under section 261 of the Countering Russian Influence in Europe and Eurasia Act of 2017 (Public Law 115–44; 131 Stat. 934).
<br>

<br>
<br>(E) Supervision and examination.—The review by a financial institution of the priorities established under subparagraph (A) and the incorporation of those priorities, as appropriate, into the risk-based programs established by the financial institution to meet obligations under this subchapter, the USA PATRIOT Act (Public Law 107–56; 115 Stat. 272), and other anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism laws and regulations shall be included as a measure on which a financial institution is supervised and examined for compliance with those obligations.
<br>
<br>(5) Duty.—The duty to establish, maintain and enforce an anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism program as required by this subsection shall remain the responsibility of, and be performed by, persons in the United States who are accessible to, and subject to oversight and supervision by, the Secretary of the Treasury and the appropriate Federal functional regulator (as defined in section 509 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (15 U.S.C. 6809)).
<br>
<br>(i) Due Diligence for United States Private Banking and Correspondent Bank Accounts Involving Foreign Persons.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—Each financial institution that establishes, maintains, administers, or manages a private banking account or a correspondent account in the United States for a non-United States person, including a foreign individual visiting the United States, or a representative of a non-United States person shall establish appropriate, specific, and, where necessary, enhanced, due diligence policies, procedures, and controls that are reasonably designed to detect and report instances of money laundering through those accounts.
<br>
<br>(2) Additional standards for certain correspondent accounts.—
<br>
<br>(A) In general.—Subparagraph (B) shall apply if a correspondent account is requested or maintained by, or on behalf of, a foreign bank operating—
<br>
<br>(i) under an offshore banking license; or
<br>
<br>(ii) under a banking license issued by a foreign country that has been designated—
<br>
<br>(I) as noncooperative with international anti-money laundering principles or procedures by an intergovernmental group or organization of which the United States is a member, with which designation the United States representative to the group or organization concurs; or
<br>
<br>(II) by the Secretary of the Treasury as warranting special measures due to money laundering concerns.
<br>
<br>(B) Policies, procedures, and controls.—The enhanced due diligence policies, procedures, and controls required under paragraph (1) shall, at a minimum, ensure that the financial institution in the United States takes reasonable steps—
<br>
<br>(i) to ascertain for any such foreign bank, the shares of which are not publicly traded, the identity of each of the owners of the foreign bank, and the nature and extent of the ownership interest of each such owner;
<br>
<br>(ii) to conduct enhanced scrutiny of such account to guard against money laundering and report any suspicious transactions under subsection (g); and
<br>
