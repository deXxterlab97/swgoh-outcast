<br>§1087tt. Discretion of student financial aid administrators
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>Nothing in this part shall be interpreted as limiting the authority of the financial aid administrator, on the basis of adequate documentation, to make adjustments on a case-by-case basis to the cost of attendance or the values of the data items required to calculate the expected student or parent contribution (or both) to allow for treatment of an individual eligible applicant with special circumstances. However, this authority shall not be construed to permit aid administrators to deviate from the contributions expected in the absence of special circumstances. Special circumstances may include tuition expenses at an elementary or secondary school, medical, dental, or nursing home expenses not covered by insurance, unusually high child care or dependent care costs, recent unemployment of a family member or an independent student, a student or family member who is a dislocated worker (as defined in section 3102 of title 29), the number of parents enrolled at least half-time in a degree, certificate, or other program leading to a recognized educational credential at an institution with a program participation agreement under section 1094 of this title, a change in housing status that results in an individual being homeless (as defined in section 11302 of title 42), or other changes in a family's income, a family's assets, or a student's status. Special circumstances shall be conditions that differentiate an individual student from a class of students rather than conditions that exist across a class of students. Adequate documentation for such adjustments shall substantiate such special circumstances of individual students. In addition, nothing in this subchapter shall be interpreted as limiting the authority of the student financial aid administrator in such cases (1) to request and use supplementary information about the financial status or personal circumstances of eligible applicants in selecting recipients and determining the amount of awards under this subchapter, or (2) to offer a dependent student financial assistance under section 1078–8 of this title or a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan without requiring the parents of such student to file the financial aid form prescribed under section 1090 of this title if the student financial aid administrator verifies that the parent or parents of such student have ended financial support of such student and refuse to file such form. No student or parent shall be charged a fee for collecting, processing, or delivering such supplementary information.
<br>(b) Adjustments to assets taken into account
<br>
<br>A student financial aid administrator shall be considered to be making a necessary adjustment in accordance with subsection (a) if—
<br>
<br>(1) the administrator makes adjustments excluding from family income any proceeds of a sale of farm or business assets of a family if such sale results from a voluntary or involuntary foreclosure, forfeiture, or bankruptcy or an involuntary liquidation; or
<br>
<br>(2) the administrator makes adjustments in the award level of a student with a disability so as to take into consideration the additional costs such student incurs as a result of such student's disability.
<br>(c) Refusal or adjustment of loan certifications
<br>
<br>On a case-by-case basis, an eligible institution may refuse to certify a statement that permits a student to receive a loan under part B or D, or may certify a loan amount or make a loan that is less than the student's determination of need (as determined under this part), if the reason for the action is documented and provided in written form to the student. No eligible institution shall discriminate against any borrower or applicant in obtaining a loan on the basis of race, national origin, religion, sex, marital status, age, or disability status.

<br>§1087tt. Discretion of student financial aid administrators
<br>(a) In general
<br>(1) Authority of financial aid administrators
<br>
<br>A financial aid administrator shall have the authority to, on the basis of adequate documentation, make adjustments to any or all of the following on a case-by-case basis:
<br>
<br>(A) For an applicant with special circumstances under subsection (b) to—
<br>
<br>(i) the cost of attendance;
<br>
<br>(ii) the values of the data used to calculate the student aid index; or
<br>
<br>(iii) the values of the data used to calculate the Federal Pell Grant award.
<br>
<br>(B) For an applicant with unusual circumstances under subsection (c), to the dependency status of such applicant.
<br>(2) Limitations on authority
<br>(A) Use of authority
<br>
<br>No institution of higher education or financial aid administrator shall maintain a policy of denying all requests for adjustments under this section.
<br>(B) No additional fee
<br>
<br>No student or parent shall be charged a fee for a documented interview of the student by the financial aid administrator or for the review of a student or parent's request for adjustments under this section including the review of any supplementary information or documentation of a student or parent's special circumstances or a student's unusual circumstances.
<br>(C) Rule of construction
<br>
<br>The authority to make adjustments under paragraph (1)(A) shall not be construed to permit financial aid administrators to deviate from the cost of attendance, the values of data used to calculate the student aid index or the values of data used to calculate the Federal Pell Grant award (or both) for awarding aid under this subchapter in the absence of special circumstances.
<br>(3) Adequate documentation
<br>
<br>Adequate documentation for adjustments under this section must substantiate the special circumstances or unusual circumstances of an individual student, and may include, to the extent relevant and appropriate—
<br>
<br>(A) a documented interview between the student and the financial aid administrator;
<br>
<br>(B) for the purposes of determining that a student qualifies for an adjustment under paragraph (1)(B)—
<br>
<br>(i) submission of a court order or official Federal or State documentation that the student or the student's parents or legal guardians are incarcerated in any Federal or State penal institution;
<br>
<br>(ii) a documented phone call or a written statement, which confirms the specific unusual circumstances with—
<br>
<br>(I) a child welfare agency authorized by a State or county;
<br>
<br>(II) a Tribal welfare authority or agency;
<br>
<br>(III) an independent living case worker, such as a case worker who supports current and former foster youth with the transition to adulthood; or
<br>
<br>(IV) a public or private agency, facility, or program servicing the victims of abuse, neglect, assault, or violence, which may include domestic violence;
<br>
<br>(iii) a documented phone call or a written statement from an attorney, a guardian ad litem, or a court-appointed special advocate, or a person serving in a similar capacity which confirms the specific unusual circumstances and documents the person's relationship to the student;
<br>
<br>(iv) a documented phone call or written statement from a representative under division 1 or 2 of subpart 2 of part A, which confirms the specific unusual circumstances and documents the representative's relationship to the student;
<br>
<br>(v) documents, such as utility bills or health insurance documentation, that demonstrate a separation from parents or legal guardians; and
<br>
<br>(vi) in the absence of documentation described in this subparagraph, other documentation the financial aid administrator determines is adequate to confirm the unusual circumstances, pursuant to section 1087vv(d)(9) of this title; and
<br>
<br>(C) supplementary information, as necessary, about the financial status or personal circumstances of eligible applicants as it relates to the special circumstances or unusual circumstances based on which the applicant is requesting an adjustment.
<br>(4) Special rule
<br>
<br>In making adjustments under paragraph (1), a financial aid administrator may offer a dependent student financial assistance under a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan without requiring the parents of such student to provide their parent information on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid if the student does not qualify for, or does not choose to use, the unusual circumstance option described in section 1087vv(d)(9) of this title, and the financial aid administrator determines that the parents of such student ended financial support of such student or refuse to file such form.
<br>(5) Public disclosure
<br>
