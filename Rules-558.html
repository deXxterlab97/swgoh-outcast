<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13170. Increasing Opportunities and Access for Disadvantaged Businesses
<br>
<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13170, Oct. 6, 2000, 65 F.R. 60827, provided:
<br>
<br>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 631 et seq.), section 7102 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (Public Law 103–355, 15 U.S.C. 644 note), the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act ([former] 41 U.S.C. 403 et seq.), Executive Order 11625 [15 U.S.C. 631 note], and to provide for increased access for disadvantaged businesses to Federal contracting opportunities, it is hereby ordered as follows:
<br>
<br>Section 1. Policy. It is the policy of the executive branch to ensure nondiscrimination in Federal procurement opportunities for businesses in the Small Disadvantaged Business Program (SDBs), businesses in the section 8(a) Business Development program of the Small Business Administration (8(a)s), and Minority Business Enterprises (MBEs) as defined in section 6 of Executive Order 11625, of October 13, 1971, and to take affirmative action to ensure inclusion of these businesses in Federal contracting. These businesses are of vital importance to job growth and the economic strength of the United States but have faced historic exclusion and underutilization in Federal procurement. All agencies within the executive branch with procurement authority are required to take all necessary steps, as permitted by law, to increase contracting between the Federal Government and SDBs, 8(a)s, and MBEs.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. Responsibilities of Executive Departments and Agencies with Procurement Authority. The head of each executive department and agency shall carry out the terms of this order and shall designate, where appropriate, his or her Deputy Secretary or equivalent to implement the terms of this order.
<br>
<br>(a) Each department and agency with procurement authority shall:
<br>
<br>(i) aggressively seek to ensure that 8(a)s, SDBs, and MBEs are aware of future prime contracting opportunities through wide dissemination of contract announcements, including sources likely to reach 8(a)s, SDBs, other small businesses, and MBEs. Each department and agency shall use all available forms of communication to implement this provision, including the Internet, speciality press, and trade press;
<br>
<br>(ii) work with the Small Business Administration (SBA) to ensure that information regarding sole source contracts awarded through the section 8(a) program receives the widest dissemination possible to 8(a)s;
<br>
<br>(iii) ensure that the price evaluation preference programs authorized by the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 [Pub. L. 103–355, see Tables for classification] are used to the maximum extent permitted by law in areas of economic activity in which SDBs have historically been underused;
<br>
<br>(iv) aggressively use the firms in the section 8(a) program, particularly in the developmental stage of the program, so that these firms have an opportunity to overcome artificial barriers to Federal contracting and gain access to the Federal procurement arena;
<br>
<br>(v) ensure that department and agency heads take all reasonable steps so that prime contractors meet or exceed Federal subcontracting goals, and enforce subcontracting commitments as required by the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)) and other related laws. In particular, they shall ensure that prime contractors actively solicit bids for subcontracting opportunities from 8(a)s and SDBs, and fulfill their SDB and section 8(d) subcontracting obligations. Enforcement of SDB subcontracting plan commitments shall include assessments of liquidated damages, where appropriate, pursuant to applicable contract clauses;
<br>
<br>(vi) encourage the establishment of business-to-business mentoring and teaming relationships, including the implementation of Mentor-Protege programs, to foster the development of the technical and managerial capabilities of 8(a)s and SDBs and to facilitate long-term business relationships;
<br>
<br>(vii) offer information, training, and technical assistance programs for 8(a)s and SDBs including, where appropriate, Government acquisition forecasts in order to assist 8(a)s and SDBs in developing their products, skills, business planning practices, and marketing techniques;
<br>
<br>(viii) train program and procurement officials regarding the policy of including 8(a)s and SDBs in Federal procurement. This includes prescribing procedures to ensure that acquisition planners, to the maximum extent practicable, structure acquisitions to facilitate competition by SDBs and 8(a)s, including their participation in the competition of multiple award requirements;
<br>
<br>(ix) provide the information required by the Department of Commerce when it requests data to develop the benchmarks used in the price evaluation preference programs authorized by the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994;
<br>
<br>(x) ensure that Directors of Offices of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization carry out their responsibilities to maximize the participation of 8(a)s and SDBs in Federal procurement and, in particular, ensure that the Directors report directly to the head of each department or agency as required by law; and
<br>
<br>(xi) as required by law, establish with the Small Business Administration small business goals to ensure that the government-wide goal for participation of small business concerns is not less than 23 percent of Federal prime contracts. Where feasible and consistent with the effective and efficient performance of its mission, each agency shall establish a goal of achieving a participation rate for SDBs of not less than 5 percent of the total value of prime contract awards for each fiscal year and of not less than 5 percent of the total value of subcontract awards for each year. Each agency shall also establish a goal for awards made to 8(a) firms pursuant to section 8(a) of the Small Business Act [15 U.S.C. 637(a)]. These goals shall be considered the minimum goals and every effort shall be taken to exceed these goals wherever feasible.
<br>
<br>(b) Each department and agency with procurement authority shall:
<br>
<br>(i) develop a long-term comprehensive plan to implement the requirements of section 2(a) of this order and submit this plan to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) within 90 days of the date of this order. The Director of OMB shall review each plan and report to the President on the sufficiency of each plan to carry out the terms of this order; and
<br>
<br>(ii) annually, by April 30 each year, assess its efforts and the results of those efforts to increase utilization of 8(a)s, SDBs, and MBEs as both prime contractors and subcontractors and report on those efforts to the President through the Director of OMB, who shall review the evaluations made of the agency assessments by the Small Business Administration.
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. Responsibilities of the Small Business Administration. The Administrator of the SBA shall:
<br>
<br>(a) evaluate on a semi-annual basis, using the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS), the achievement of government-wide prime and subcontract goals and the actual prime and subcontract awards to 8(a)s and SDBs for each department and agency. The OMB shall review SBA's evaluation;
<br>
<br>(b) ensure that Procurement Center Representatives receive adequate training regarding the section 8(a) and SDB programs and that they consistently and aggressively seek opportunities for maximizing the use of 8(a)s and SDBs in department and agency procurements; and
<br>
<br>(c) ensure that each department and agency's small and disadvantaged business procurement goals as well as the amount of procurement of each department and agency with 8(a)s, SDBs, and MBEs is publicly available in an easily accessible and understandable format such as through publication on the Internet.
<br>
<br>Sec. 4. Federal Advertising. Each department or agency that contracts with businesses to develop advertising for the department or agency or to broadcast Federal advertising shall take an aggressive role in ensuring substantial minority-owned entities' participation, including 8(a), SDB, and MBE, in Federal advertising-related procurements. Each department and agency shall ensure that all creation, placement, and transmission of Federal advertising is fully reflective of the Nation's diversity. To achieve this diversity, special attention shall be given to ensure placement in publications and television and radio stations that reach specific ethnic and racial audiences. Each department and agency shall ensure that payment for Federal advertising is commensurate with fair market rates in the relevant market. Each department and agency shall structure advertising contracts as commercial acquisitions consistent with part 12 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation processes and paperwork to enhance participation by 8(a)s, SDBs, and MBEs.
<br>
<br>Sec. 5. Information Technology. Each department and agency shall aggressively seek to ensure substantial 8(a), SDB, and MBE participation in procurements for and related to information technology, including procurements in the telecommunications industry. In so doing, the Chief Information Officer in each department and agency shall coordinate with procurement officials to implement this section.
<br>
<br>Sec. 6. General Services Administration Schedules. The SBA and the General Services Administration (GSA) shall act promptly to expand inclusion of 8(a)s and SDBs on GSA Schedules, and provide greater opportunities for 8(a) and SDB participation in orders under such schedules. The GSA should ensure that procurement and program officials at all levels that use GSA Schedules aggressively seek to utilize the Schedule contracts of 8(a)s and SDBs. The GSA shall allow agencies ordering from designated 8(a) firms under the Multiple Award Schedule to count those orders toward their 8(a) procurement goals.
<br>
<br>Sec. 7. Bundling Contracts. To the extent permitted by law, departments and agencies must submit to the SBA for review any contracts that are proposed to be bundled. The determination of the SBA with regard to the appropriateness of bundling in each instance must be carefully reviewed by the department or agency head, or his or her designee, and must be given due consideration. If there is an unresolvable conflict, then the SBA or the department or agency can seek assistance from the OMB.
<br>
<br>Sec. 8. Awards Program. The Secretary of Commerce and the Administrator of the SBA shall jointly undertake a feasibility study to determine the appropriateness of an awards program for executive departments and agencies who best exemplify the letter and intent of this order in increasing opportunities for 8(a)s, SDBs, and MBEs in Federal procurement. Such study shall be presented to the President within 90 days of the date of this order.
<br>
<br>Sec. 9. Applicability. Independent agencies are requested to comply with the provisions of this order.
<br>
<br>Sec. 10. Administration, Enforcement, and Judicial Review.
<br>
<br>(a) This order shall be carried out to the extent permitted by law and consistent with the Administration's priorities and appropriations.
<br>
<br>(b) This order is not intended and should not be construed to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or its employees.

<br>Delegation of Authority To Establish Annual Goals for Participation of Small Business Concerns in Procurement Contracts
<br>
<br>Memorandum of the President of the United States, June 6, 1990, 55 F.R. 27453–27455, provided:
<br>
<br>Memorandum for the Director of the Office of Management and Budget
<br>
<br>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States, including section 15(g) of the Small Business Act, as amended [subsec. (g) of this section], and section 301 of Title 3 of the United States Code, I hereby delegate to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget the authority vested in the President to establish the annual goals required by Section 502 of the Business Opportunity Development Reform Act of 1988 (P.L. 100–656) [amending this section].
<br>
<br>You are authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

<br>Continued Commitment to Small, Small Disadvantaged, and Small Women-Owned Businesses in Federal Procurement
<br>
<br>Memorandum of President of the United States, Oct. 13, 1994, 59 F.R. 52397, provided:
<br>
<br>Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies [and] the President's Management Council
<br>
<br>It is the policy of the Federal Government that a fair proportion of its contracts be placed with small, small disadvantaged, and small women-owned businesses. Such businesses should also have the maximum practicable opportunity to participate as subcontractors in contracts awarded by the Federal Government consistent with efficient contract performance. I am committed to the continuation of this policy. Therefore, I ask that you encourage the use of various tools, including set-asides, price preferences, and section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)), as necessary to achieve this policy objective.
<br>
<br>The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 [Pub. L. 103–355, see Short Title of 1994 Act note set out under section 101 of Title 41, Public Contracts] authorizes civilian agencies to utilize set-aside procurements for small disadvantaged businesses. The Act also, for the first time, establishes goals for contracting with small women-owned businesses. These provisions, along with others in the Act, will provide greater access to Federal Government business opportunities for small, small disadvantaged, and small women-owned businesses. Department and agency heads should ensure that efforts to streamline acquisition procedures encourage the participation of these businesses in Federal procurements.
<br>
<br>This memorandum shall be published in the Federal Register.

<br>
<br>(C) Definition.—In this paragraph, the term "Export Assistance Center" has the same meaning as in section 649 of this title.
<br>
<br>(3) The Small Business Development Center Program shall be under the general management and oversight of the Administration for the delivery of programs and services to the small business community. Such programs and services shall be jointly developed, negotiated, and agreed upon, with full participation of both parties, pursuant to an executed cooperative agreement between the Small Business Development Center applicant and the Administration.
<br>

<br>
<br>(B) Restriction.—The matching amount described in subparagraph (A) shall not include any indirect costs or in-kind contributions derived from any Federal program.
<br>
<br>(C) Funding formula.—
<br>
<br>(i) In general.—Subject to clause (iii), the amount of a formula grant received by a State under this subparagraph shall be equal to an amount determined in accordance with the following formula:
<br>
<br>(I) The annual amount made available under section 20(a) 2 for the Small Business Development Center Program, less any reductions made for expenses authorized by clause (v) of this subparagraph, shall be divided on a pro rata basis, based on the percentage of the population of each State, as compared to the population of the United States.

<br>
<br>(III) The aggregate amount calculated under subclause (II) shall be deducted from the amount calculated under subclause (I) for States eligible to receive more than the minimum funding level. The deductions shall be made on a pro rata basis, based on the population of each such State, as compared to the total population of all such States.
<br>
<br>(IV) The aggregate amount deducted under subclause (III) shall be added to the grants of those States that are not eligible to receive more than the minimum funding level in order to achieve the minimum funding level for each such State, except that the eligible amount of a grant to any State shall not be reduced to an amount below the minimum funding level.
<br>
<br>(ii) Grant determination.—The amount of a grant that a State is eligible to apply for under this subparagraph shall be the amount determined under clause (i), subject to any modifications required under clause (iii), and shall be based on the amount available for the fiscal year in which performance of the grant commences, but not including amounts distributed in accordance with clause (iv).

<br>
<br>(iii) Minimum funding level.—The amount of the minimum funding level for each State shall be determined for each fiscal year based on the amount made available for that fiscal year to carry out this section, as follows:
<br>
<br>(I) If the amount made available is not less than $81,500,000 and not more than $90,000,000, the minimum funding level shall be $500,000.
<br>
<br>(II) If the amount made available is less than $81,500,000, the minimum funding level shall be the remainder of $500,000 minus a percentage of $500,000 equal to the percentage amount by which the amount made available is less than $81,500,000.
<br>
<br>(III) If the amount made available is more than $90,000,000, the minimum funding level shall be the sum of $500,000 plus a percentage of $500,000 equal to the percentage amount by which the amount made available exceeds $90,000,000.
<br>
<br>(iv) Distributions.—Subject to clause (iii), if any State does not apply for, or use, its full funding eligibility for a fiscal year, the Administration shall distribute the remaining funds as follows:
<br>
<br>(I) If the grant to any State is less than the amount received by that State in fiscal year 2000, the Administration shall distribute such remaining funds, on a pro rata basis, based on the percentage of shortage of each such State, as compared to the total amount of such remaining funds available, to the extent necessary in order to increase the amount of the grant to the amount received by that State in fiscal year 2000, or until such funds are exhausted, whichever first occurs.
<br>
<br>(II) If any funds remain after the application of subclause (I), the remaining amount may be distributed as supplemental grants to any State, as the Administration determines, in its discretion, to be appropriate, after consultation with the association referred to in subsection (a)(3)(A).

<br>
<br>(II) Limitation.—No funds described in subclause (I) may be used for examination expenses under section 20(a)(1)(E) 2 if the usage would reduce the amount of grants made available under clause (i)(I) of this subparagraph to less than $85,000,000 (after excluding any amounts provided in appropriations Acts, or accompanying report language, for specific institutions or for purposes other than the general small business development center program) or would further reduce the amount of such grants below such amount.
<br>
