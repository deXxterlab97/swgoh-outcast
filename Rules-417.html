<br>§1783. National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund
<br>(a) Creation; use of fund
<br>
<br>There is hereby created in the Treasury of the United States a National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund which shall be used by the Board as a revolving fund for carrying out the purposes of this subchapter. Money in the fund shall be available upon requisition by the Board, without fiscal year limitation, for making payments of insurance under section 1787 of this title, for providing assistance and making expenditures under section 1788 of this title in connection with the liquidation or threatened liquidation of insured credit unions, and for such administrative and other expenses incurred in carrying out the purposes of this subchapter as it may determine to be proper.
<br>(b) Deposit of deposits and premium charges, fees and penalties
<br>
<br>All deposits and premium charges for insurance paid pursuant to the provisions of section 1782 of this title and all fees for examinations and all penalties collected by the Board under any provision of this subchapter shall be deposited in the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund. The Board shall report annually to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives with respect to the operating level of the fund. Such report shall also include the results of an independent audit of the fund.
<br>(c) Investment authorization
<br>
<br>The Board may authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to invest and reinvest such portions of the fund as the Board may determine are not needed for current operations in any interest-bearing securities of the United States or in any securities guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States or in bonds or other obligations which are lawful investments for fiduciary, trust, and public funds of the United States, and the income therefrom shall constitute a part of the fund.
<br>(d) Loans to fund, limitation and terms; interest accrual; determination of interest rate
<br>
<br>(1) If, in the judgment of the Board, a loan to the insurance fund, or to the stabilization fund described in section 1790e of this title, is required at any time for purposes of this subchapter,1 the Secretary of the Treasury shall make the loan, but loans under this paragraph shall not exceed in the aggregate $6,000,000,000 outstanding at any one time. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, section 1790e of this title, and in subsection (e) of this section, each loan under this paragraph shall be made on such terms as may be fixed by agreement between the Board and the Secretary of the Treasury.
<br>
<br>(2) Interest shall accrue to the Treasury on the amount of any outstanding loans made to the fund pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection on the basis of the average daily amount of such outstanding loans determined at the close of each fiscal year with respect to such year, and the Board shall pay the interest so accruing into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts annually from the fund. The Secretary of the Treasury shall determine the applicable interest rate in advance by calculating the average yield to maturity (on the basis of daily closing market bid quotations during the month of September of the preceding fiscal year) on outstanding marketable public debt obligations of the United States having a maturity date of five or less years from the first day of such month of September and by adjusting such yield to the nearest one-eighth of 1 per centum.
<br>
<br>(3) For the purpose of making loans under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to use as a public debt transaction the proceeds of the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31, and the purposes for which securities may be issued under chapter 31 of title 31 are hereby extended to include such loans. All loans and repayments under this section shall be treated as public debt transactions of the United States.
<br>
<br>(4) Temporary increases authorized.—
<br>
<br>(A) Recommendations for increase.—During the period beginning on May 20, 2009, and ending on December 31, 2010, if, upon the written recommendation of the Board (upon a vote of not less than two-thirds of the members of the Board) and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (upon a vote of not less than two-thirds of the members of such Board), the Secretary of the Treasury (in consultation with the President) determines that additional amounts above the $6,000,000,000 amount specified in paragraph (1) are necessary, such amount shall be increased to the amount so determined to be necessary, not to exceed $30,000,000,000.
<br>
<br>(B) Report required.—If the borrowing authority of the Board is increased above $6,000,000,000 pursuant to subparagraph (A), the Board shall promptly submit a report to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives describing the reasons and need for the additional borrowing authority and its intended uses.
<br>(e) Excess funds credited against loans
<br>
<br>So long as any loans to the fund are outstanding, the Board shall from time to time, not less often than annually, determine whether the balance in the fund is in excess of the amount which, in its judgment, is needed to meet the requirements of the fund and shall pay such excess to the Secretary of the Treasury, to be credited against the loans to the fund.
<br>(f) Authorization for fund to borrow from Central Liquidity Facility
<br>
<br>In addition to the authority to borrow from the Secretary of the Treasury provided in subsection (d), if in the judgment of the Board, a loan to the fund is required at any time for carrying out the purposes of this subchapter, the fund is authorized to borrow from the National Credit Union Administration Central Liquidity Facility.

<br>In connection with examinations of insured credit unions, or with other types of investigations to determine compliance with applicable law and regulations, the Board, or its designated representatives, shall have power to administer oaths and affirmations, to examine and to take and preserve testimony under oath as to any matter in respect of the affairs of any such credit union, and to issue subpenas and subpenas duces tecum and to exercise such other powers as are set forth in section 1786(p) of this title and, for the enforcement thereof, to apply to the United States district court for the judicial district or the United States Court in any territory in which the principal office of the credit union is located or in which the witness resides or carries on business. Such courts shall have jurisdiction and power to order and require compliance with any such subpena.
<br>(c) Court orders enforcing subpenas; immunity
<br>
<br>In cases of refusal to obey a subpena issued to, or contumacy by, any person, the Board may invoke the aid of any court of the United States within the jurisdiction of which such hearing, examination, or investigation is carried on, or where such person resides or carries on business, in requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, records, or other papers. Such court may issue an order requiring such person to appear before the Board, or before a person designated by it, there to produce records, if so ordered, or to give testimony touching the matter in question. Any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof. All process in any such case may be served in the judicial district whereof such person is an inhabitant or carries on business or wherever he may be found. No person shall be excused from attending and testifying or from producing books, records, or other papers in obedience to a subpena issued under the authority of this subchapter on the ground that the testimony or evidence, documentary or otherwise, required of him may tend to incriminate him or subject him to penalty or forfeiture, but no individual shall be prosecuted or subject to any penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any transaction, matter, or thing concerning which he is compelled to testify or produce evidence, documentary or otherwise, after having claimed his privilege against self-incrimination, except that such individual so testifying shall not be exempt from prosecution and punishment for perjury committed in so testifying.
<br>(d) Administration acceptance of State board reports; reports of Board furnished to State board
<br>
<br>The Administration may accept any report of examination made by or to any commission, board, or authority having supervision of a State-chartered credit union and may furnish to any such commission, board, or authority reports of examination made on behalf of the Board.
<br>(e) Flood insurance compliance by insured credit unions
<br>(1) Examination
<br>
<br>The Board shall, during each examination conducted under this section, determine whether the insured credit union is complying with the requirements of the national flood insurance program.

<br>
<br>Not later than 1 year after September 23, 1994, and biennially thereafter for the next 4 years, the Board shall submit a report to the Congress on compliance by insured credit unions with the requirements of the national flood insurance program.
<br>(B) Contents
<br>

<br>
<br>(1) periodically assess the potential liquidity needs of each insured credit union, and the options that the credit union has available for meeting those needs; and

<br>
<br>(A) In general.—Notwithstanding paragraph (1), an insured credit union may convert to a mutual savings bank or savings association (if the savings association is in mutual form), as those terms are defined in section 1813 of this title, without the prior approval of the Board, subject to the requirements and procedures set forth in the laws and regulations governing mutual savings banks and savings associations.
<br>
<br>(B) Conversion proposal.—A proposal for a conversion described in subparagraph (A) shall first be approved, and a date set for a vote thereon by the members (either at a meeting to be held on that date or by written ballot to be filed on or before that date), by a majority of the directors of the insured credit union. Approval of the proposal for conversion shall be by the affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the insured credit union who vote on the proposal.
<br>

<br>
<br>(G) Consistent rules.—
<br>
<br>(i) In general.—Not later than 6 months after August 7, 1998, the Administration shall promulgate final rules applicable to charter conversions described in this paragraph that are consistent with rules promulgated by other financial regulators, including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

<br>
<br>(3) Except with the prior written approval of the Board, no insured credit union shall merge or consolidate with any other insured credit union or, either directly or indirectly, acquire the assets of, or assume liability to pay any member accounts in, any other insured credit union.
<br>(c) Considerations for waiver or enforcement of restrictions
<br>
<br>In granting or withholding approval or consent under subsection (b) of this section, the Board shall consider—
<br>
<br>(1) the history, financial condition, and management policies of the credit union;
<br>
<br>(2) the adequacy of the credit union's reserves;
<br>
<br>(3) the economic advisability of the transaction;
<br>
<br>(4) the general character and fitness of the credit union's management;
<br>
<br>(5) the convenience and needs of the members to be served by the credit union; and
<br>
<br>(6) whether the credit union is a cooperative association organized for the purpose of promoting thrift among its members and creating a source of credit for provident or productive purposes.
<br>(d) Prohibition
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Except with prior written consent of the Board—

<br>(B) Exception by order of sentencing court
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>On motion of the Board, the court in which the conviction or the agreement of a person referred to in subparagraph (A) has been entered may grant an exception to the application of paragraph (1) to such person if granting the exception is in the interest of justice.

<br>
<br>A motion may be filed under clause (i) at any time during the 10-year period described in subparagraph (A) with regard to the person on whose behalf such motion is made.

<br>(f) Share draft accounts; maintenance, loans, etc.
<br>
<br>(1) Every insured credit union is authorized to maintain, and make loans with respect to, share draft accounts in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the Board. Except as provided in paragraph (2), an insured credit union may pay dividends on share draft accounts and may permit the owners of such share draft accounts to make withdrawals by negotiable or transferable instruments or other orders for the purpose of making transfers to third parties.
<br>
<br>(2) Paragraph (1) shall apply only with respect to share draft accounts in which the entire beneficial interest is held by one or more individuals or members or by an organization which is operated primarily for religious, philanthropic, charitable, educational, or other similar purposes and which is not operated for profit, and with respect to deposits of public funds by an officer, employee, or agent of the United States, any State, county, municipality, or political subdivision thereof, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, any territory or possession of the United States, or any political subdivision thereof.
<br>(g) Interest rates
<br>
<br>(1) If the applicable rate prescribed in this subsection exceeds the rate an insured credit union would be permitted to charge in the absence of this subsection, such credit union may, notwithstanding any State constitution or statute which is hereby preempted for the purposes of this subsection, take, receive, reserve, and charge on any loan, interest at a rate of not more than 1 per centum in excess of the discount rate on ninety-day commercial paper in effect at the Federal Reserve bank in the Federal Reserve district where such insured credit union is located or at the rate allowed by the laws of the State, territory, or district where such credit union is located, whichever may be greater.
<br>
<br>(2) If the rate prescribed in paragraph (1) exceeds the rate such credit union would be permitted to charge in the absence of this subsection, and such State fixed rate is thereby preempted by the rate described in paragraph (1), the taking, receiving, reserving, or charging a greater rate than is allowed by paragraph (1), when knowingly done, shall be deemed a forfeiture of the entire interest which the loan carries with it, or which has been agreed to be paid thereon. If such greater rate of interest has been paid, the person who paid it may recover, in a civil action commenced in a court of appropriate jurisdiction not later than two years after the date of such payment, an amount equal to twice the amount of interest paid from the credit union taking or receiving such interest.
<br>(h) Emergency merger
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Board may authorize a merger or consolidation of an insured credit union which is insolvent or is in danger of insolvency with any other insured credit union or may authorize an insured credit union to purchase any of the assets of, or assume any of the liabilities of, any other insured credit union which is insolvent or in danger of insolvency if the Board is satisfied that—
<br>
<br>(1) an emergency requiring expeditious action exists with respect to such other insured credit union;
<br>
<br>(2) other alternatives are not reasonably available; and
<br>
<br>(3) the public interest would best be served by approval of such merger, consolidation, purchase, or assumption.
<br>(i) Emergency purchase of assets; conversion to insured deposits
<br>
<br>(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter or of State law, the Board may authorize an institution whose deposits or accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to purchase any of the assets of or assume any of the liabilities of an insured credit union which is insolvent or in danger of insolvency, except that prior to exercising this authority the Board must attempt to effect the merger or consolidation of an insured credit union which is insolvent or in danger of insolvency with another insured credit union, as provided in subsection (h).
<br>
<br>(2) For purposes of the authority contained in paragraph (1), insured accounts of the credit union may upon consummation of the purchase and assumption be converted to insured deposits or other comparable accounts in the acquiring institution, and the Board and the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund shall be absolved of any liability to the credit union's members with respect to those accounts.
<br>(j) Privileges not affected by disclosure to banking agency or supervisor
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The submission by any person of any information to the Administration, any State credit union supervisor, or foreign banking authority for any purpose in the course of any supervisory or regulatory process of such Board, supervisor, or authority shall not be construed as waiving, destroying, or otherwise affecting any privilege such person may claim with respect to such information under Federal or State law as to any person or entity other than such Board, supervisor, or authority.
<br>(2) Rule of construction
<br>
<br>No provision of paragraph (1) may be construed as implying or establishing that—
<br>
<br>(A) any person waives any privilege applicable to information that is submitted or transferred under any circumstance to which paragraph (1) does not apply; or
<br>
<br>(B) any person would waive any privilege applicable to any information by submitting the information to the Administration, any State credit union supervisor, or foreign banking authority, but for this subsection.

<br>§1786. Termination of insured credit union status; cease and desist orders; removal or suspension from office; procedure
<br>(a) Termination of insurance
<br>
<br>(1) Any insured credit union other than a Federal credit union may, upon not less than ninety days' written notice to the Board and upon the affirmative vote of a majority of its members within one year prior to the giving of such notice, terminate its status as an insured credit union.
<br>
<br>(2) Any insured credit union, other than a Federal credit union, which has obtained a new certificate of insurance from a corporation authorized and duly licensed to insure member accounts may upon not less than ninety days' written notice to the Board convert from status as an insured credit union under this chapter: Provided, That at the time of giving notice to the Board the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section are not being invoked against the credit union.
<br>(b) Unsound condition of credit union; notice to correct condition; hearing; judicial review
<br>
<br>(1) Whenever, in the opinion of the Board, any insured credit union is engaging or has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting the business of such credit union, or is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations as an insured credit union, or is violating or has violated an applicable law, rule, regulation, order, or any condition imposed in writing by the Board in connection with any action on any application, notice, or other request by the credit union or institution-affiliated party,, 1 or is violating or has violated any written agreement entered into with the Board, the Board shall serve upon the credit union a statement with respect to such practices or conditions or violations for the purpose of securing the correction thereof. In the case of an insured State-chartered credit union, the Board shall send a copy of such statement to the commission, board, or authority, if any, having supervision of such credit union. Unless such correction shall be made within one hundred and twenty days after service of such statement, or within such shorter period of not less than twenty days after such service as the Board shall require in any case where it determines that the insurance risk with respect to such credit union could be unduly jeopardized by further delay in the correction of such practices or conditions or violations, or as the commission, board, or authority having supervision of such credit union, if any, shall require in the case of an insured State-chartered credit union, the Board, if it shall determine to proceed further, shall give to the credit union not less than thirty days' written notice of its intention to terminate the status of the credit union as an insured credit union. Such notice shall contain a statement of the facts constituting the alleged unsafe and unsound practices or conditions or violations and shall fix a time and place for a hearing thereon. Such hearing shall be fixed for a date not earlier than thirty days nor later than sixty days after service of such notice unless an earlier or a later date is set by the Board at the request of the credit union. Unless the credit union shall appear at the hearing by a duly authorized representative, it shall be deemed to have consented to the termination of its status as an insured credit union. In the event of such consent, or if upon the record made at any such hearing the Board shall find that any unsafe or unsound practice or condition or violation specified in the notice has been established and has not been corrected within the time above-prescribed in which to make such correction, the Board may issue and serve upon the credit union an order terminating its status as an insured credit union on a date subsequent to the date of such finding and subsequent to the expiration of the time specified in the notice.
<br>
<br>(2) Any credit union whose insured status has been terminated by order of the Board under this subsection shall have the right of judicial review of such order only to the same extent as provided for the review of orders under subsection (j) of this section.
<br>(c) Notice to members of termination of insured status
<br>
<br>In the event of the termination of a credit union's status as an insured credit union as provided under subsection (a)(1) or (b) of this section, the credit union shall give prompt and reasonable notice to all of its members whose accounts are insured that it has ceased to be an insured credit union. It may include in such notice a statement of the fact that member accounts insured on the effective date of such termination, to the extent not withdrawn, remain insured for one year from the date of such termination, but it shall not further represent itself in any manner as an insured credit union. In the event of failure to give the notice as herein provided to members whose accounts are insured, the Board is authorized to give reasonable notice.
<br>(d) Continuation of insurance for one year; approval of conversion of status; procedure subsequent to approval; reduction of premium charges
<br>
<br>(1) After the termination of the insured status of any credit union as provided under subsection (a)(1) or (b) of this section, insurance of its member accounts to the extent that they were insured on the effective date of such termination, less any amounts thereafter withdrawn which reduce the accounts below the amount covered by insurance on the effective date of such termination, shall continue for a period of one year, but no shares issued by the credit union or deposits made after the date of such termination shall be insured by the Board. The credit union shall continue to maintain its deposit with and pay premiums to the Board during such period as in the case of an insured credit union and the Board shall have the right to examine such credit union from time to time during the period during which such insurance continues. Such credit union shall, in all other respects, be subject to the duties and obligations of an insured credit union for the period of one year from the date of such termination. In the event that such credit union shall be closed for liquidation within such period of one year, the Board shall have the same powers and rights with respect to such credit union as in the case of an insured credit union. Notwithstanding the above, when an insured credit union's insured status is terminated and the credit union subsequently obtains comparable insurance coverage from another source, insurance of its accounts by the fund may cease immediately upon the effective date of such comparable coverage by mutual consent of the credit union and the Board.
<br>
<br>(2) No credit union shall convert from status as an insured credit union under this chapter as provided under subsection (a)(2) of this section until the proposition for such conversion has been approved by a majority of all the directors of the credit union, and by affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the credit union who vote on the proposition in a vote in which at least 20 per centum of the total membership of the credit union participates. Following approval by the directors, written notice of the proposition and of the date set for the membership vote shall be delivered in person to each member, or mailed to each member at the address for such member appearing on the records of the credit union, not more than thirty nor less than seven days prior to such date. The membership shall be given the opportunity to vote by mail ballot. If the proposition is approved by the membership, prompt and reasonable notice of insurance conversion shall be given to all members.
<br>
<br>(3) In the event of a conversion of a credit union from status as an insured credit union under this chapter as provided under subsection (a)(2) of this section, premium charges payable under section 1782(c) of this title shall be reduced by an amount proportionate to the number of calendar months for which the converting credit union will no longer be insured under this chapter. As long as a converting credit union remains insured under this chapter, it shall remain subject to all of the provisions of this subchapter.
<br>(e) Opinion of Board as to unsound condition of credit union; notice of charges; hearing; order to cease and desist; judicial review
<br>
<br>(1) If, in the opinion of the Board, any insured credit union, credit union which has insured accounts, or any institution-affiliated party is engaging or has engaged, or the Board has reasonable cause to believe that the credit union or any institution-affiliated party is about to engage, in an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting the business of such credit union, or is violating or has violated, or the Board has reasonable cause to believe that the credit union or any institution-affiliated party is about to violate, a law, rule, or regulation, or any condition imposed in writing by the Board in connection with the granting of any application or other request by the credit union or any written agreement entered into with the Board, the Board may issue and serve upon the credit union or such party a notice of charges in respect thereof. The notice shall contain a statement of the facts constituting the alleged violation or violations or the unsafe or unsound practice or practices, and shall fix a time and place at which a hearing will be held to determine whether an order to cease and desist therefrom should issue against the credit union or the institution-affiliated party. Such hearing shall be fixed for a date not earlier than thirty days nor later than sixty days after service of such notice unless an earlier or a later date is set by the Board at the request of any party so served. Unless the party or parties so served shall appear at the hearing by a duly authorized representative, they shall be deemed to have consented to the issuance of the cease-and-desist order. In the event of such consent, or if upon the record made at any such hearing, the Board shall find that any violation or unsafe or unsound practice specified in the notice of charges has been established, the Board may issue and serve upon the credit union or the institution-affiliated party an order to cease and desist from any such violation or practice. Such order may, by provisions which may be mandatory or otherwise, require the credit union or its institution-affiliated parties to cease and desist from the same, and, further, to take affirmative action to correct the conditions resulting from any such violation or practice.
<br>
<br>(2) A cease-and-desist order shall become effective at the expiration of thirty days after the service of such order upon the credit union or other person concerned (except in the case of a cease-and-desist order issued upon consent, which shall become effective at the time specified therein), and shall remain effective and enforceable as provided therein, except to such extent as it is stayed, modified, terminated, or set aside by action of the Board or a reviewing court.
<br>
<br>(3) Affirmative action to correct conditions resulting from violations or practices.—The authority to issue an order under this subsection and subsection (f) which requires an insured credit union or any institution-affiliated party to take affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice with respect to which such order is issued includes the authority to require such insured credit union or such party to—
<br>
<br>(A) make restitution or provide reimbursement, indemnification, or guarantee against loss if—
<br>
<br>(i) such credit union or such party was unjustly enriched in connection with such violation or practice; or
<br>
<br>(ii) the violation or practice involved a reckless disregard for the law or any applicable regulations or prior order of the Board;
<br>
<br>(B) restrict the growth of the institution;
<br>
<br>(C) rescind agreements or contracts;
<br>
<br>(D) dispose of any loan or asset involved;
<br>
<br>(E) employ qualified officers or employees (who may be subject to approval by the Board at the direction of such Board); and
<br>
<br>(F) take such other action as the Board determines to be appropriate.
<br>
<br>(4) Authority to limit activities.—The authority to issue an order under this subsection or subsection (f) includes the authority to place limitations on the activities or functions of an insured credit union or any institution-affiliated party.
<br>(f) Temporary cease and desist order; injunctive procedure
<br>
<br>(1) Whenever the Board shall determine that the violation or threatened violation or the unsafe or unsound practice or practices, specified in the notice of charges served upon the credit union or any institution-affiliated party pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection (e) of this section, or the continuation thereof, is likely to cause insolvency or significant dissipation of assets or earnings of the credit union, or is likely to weaken the condition of the credit union or otherwise prejudice the interests of its insured members prior to the completion of the proceedings conducted pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection (e) of this section, the Board may issue a temporary order requiring the credit union or such party to cease and desist from any such violation or practice and to take affirmative action to prevent such insolvency, dissipation, condition, or prejudice pending completion of such proceedings. Such order may include any requirement authorized under subsection (e)(3). Such order shall become effective upon service upon the credit union or such institution-affiliated party and, unless set aside, limited, or suspended by a court in proceedings authorized by paragraph (2) of this subsection, shall remain effective and enforceable pending the completion of the administrative proceedings pursuant to such notice and until such time as the Administration shall dismiss the charges specified in such notice, or if a cease-and-desist order is issued against the credit union or such party, until the effective date of such order.
<br>
<br>(2) Within ten days after the credit union concerned or any institution-affiliated party has been served with a temporary cease-and-desist order, the credit union or such party may apply to the United States district court for the judicial district in which the home office of the credit union is located, or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, for an injunction setting aside, limiting, or suspending the enforcement, operation, or effectiveness of such order pending the completion of the administrative proceedings pursuant to the notice of charges served upon the credit union or such party under paragraph (1) of subsection (e) of this section, and such court shall have jurisdiction to issue such injunction.
<br>
<br>(3) Incomplete or inaccurate records.—
<br>
<br>(A) Temporary order.—If a notice of charges served under subsection (e)(1) specifies, on the basis of particular facts and circumstances, that an insured credit union's books and records are so incomplete or inaccurate that the Board is unable, through the normal supervisory process, to determine the financial condition of that insured credit union or the details or purpose of any transaction or transactions that may have a material effect on the financial condition of that insured credit union, the Board may issue a temporary order requiring—
<br>
<br>(i) the cessation of any activity or practice which gave rise, whether in whole or in part, to the incomplete or inaccurate state of the books or records; or
<br>
<br>(ii) affirmative action to restore such books or records to a complete and accurate state, until the completion of the proceedings under subsection (e)(1).
<br>
<br>(B) Effective period.—Any temporary order issued under subparagraph (A)—
<br>
<br>(i) shall become effective upon service; and
<br>
<br>(ii) unless set aside, limited, or suspended by a court in proceedings under paragraph (2), shall remain in effect and enforceable until the earlier of—
<br>
<br>(I) the completion of the proceeding initiated under subsection (e)(1) in connection with the notice of charges; or
<br>
<br>(II) the date the Board determines, by examination or otherwise, that the insured credit union's books and records are accurate and reflect the financial condition of the credit union.
<br>
<br>(4) In the case of violation or threatened violation of, or failure to obey, a temporary cease-and-desist order, the Board may apply to the United States district court, or the United States court of any territory, within the jurisdiction of which the principal office of the credit union is located for an injunction to enforce such order, and, if the court shall determine that there has been such violation or threatened violation or failure to obey, it shall be the duty of the court to issue such injunction.
<br>(g) Removal and prohibition authority
<br>
<br>(1) Authority to issue order.—Whenever the Board determines that—
<br>
<br>(A) any institution-affiliated party has, directly or indirectly—
<br>
<br>(i) violated—
<br>
<br>(I) any law or regulation;
<br>
<br>(II) any cease-and-desist order which has become final;
<br>
<br>(III) any condition imposed in writing by the Board in connection with any action on any application, notice, or request by such credit union or institution-affiliated party; or
<br>
<br>(IV) any written agreement between such credit union and the Board;
<br>
<br>(ii) engaged or participated in any unsafe or unsound practice in connection with any insured credit union or business institution; or
<br>
<br>(iii) committed or engaged in any act, omission, or practice which constitutes a breach of such party's fiduciary duty;
<br>
<br>(B) by reason of the violation, practice, or breach described in any clause of subparagraph (A)—
<br>
<br>(i) such insured credit union or business institution has suffered or will probably suffer financial loss or other damage;
<br>
<br>(ii) the interests of the insured credit union's members have been or could be prejudiced; or
<br>
<br>(iii) such party has received financial gain or other benefit by reason of such violation, practice or breach; and
<br>
<br>(C) such violation, practice, or breach—
<br>
<br>(i) involves personal dishonesty on the part of such party; or
<br>
<br>(ii) demonstrates such party's unfitness to serve as a director or officer of, or to otherwise participate in the conduct of the affairs of, an insured credit union,
<br>
<br>the Board may serve upon such party a written notice of the Board's intention to remove such party from office or to prohibit any further participation, by such party, in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of any insured credit union.
<br>
<br>(2) Specific violations.—
<br>
<br>(A) In general.—Whenever the Board determines that—
<br>
<br>(i) an institution-affiliated party has committed a violation of any provision of subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31, unless such violation was inadvertent or unintentional;
<br>
<br>(ii) an officer or director of an insured credit union has knowledge that an institution-affiliated party of the insured credit union has violated any such provision or any provision of law referred to in subsection (i)(1)(A)(ii); or
<br>
<br>(iii) an officer or director of an insured credit union has committed any violation of the Depository Institution Management Interlocks Act [12 U.S.C. 3201 et seq.],
<br>
<br>the Board may serve upon such party, officer, or director a written notice of the Board's intention to remove such officer or director from office.
<br>
<br>(B) Factors to be considered.—In determining whether an officer or director should be removed as a result of the application of subparagraph (A)(ii), the Board shall consider whether the officer or director took appropriate action to stop, or to prevent the recurrence of, a violation described in such subparagraph.
<br>
<br>(3) Suspension order.—
<br>
<br>(A) Suspension or prohibition authorized.—If the Board serves written notice under paragraph (1) or (2) to any institution-affiliated party of the Board's intention to issue an order under such paragraph, the Board may suspend such party from office or prohibit such party from further participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of the institution, if the Board—
<br>
<br>(i) determines that such action is necessary for the protection of the credit union or the interests of the credit union's members; and
<br>
<br>(ii) serves such person with written notice of the suspension order.
<br>
<br>(B) Effective period.—Any suspension order issued under subparagraph (A)—
<br>
<br>(i) shall become effective upon service; and
<br>
<br>(ii) unless a court issues a stay of such order under paragraph (6), shall remain in effect and enforceable until—
<br>
<br>(I) the date the Board dismisses the charges contained in the notice served under paragraph (1) or (2) with respect to such party; or
<br>
<br>(II) the effective date of an order issued by the Board to such person under paragraph (1) or (2).
<br>
<br>(C) Copy of order.—If the Board issues a suspension order under subparagraph (A) to any institution-affiliated party, the Board shall serve a copy of such order on any insured credit union with which such party is associated at the time such order is issued.
<br>
<br>(4) A notice of intention to remove a director, committee member, officer, or other person from office or to prohibit his participation in the conduct of the affairs of an insured credit union, shall contain a statement of the facts constituting grounds therefor, and shall fix a time and place at which a hearing will be held thereon. Such hearing shall be fixed for a date not earlier than thirty days nor later than sixty days after the date of service of such notice, unless an earlier or a later date is set by the Board at the request of (A) such director, committee member, or officer or other person, and for good cause shown, or (B) the Attorney General of the United States. Unless such director, committee member, officer, or other person shall appear at the hearing in person or by a duly authorized representative, he shall be deemed to have consented to the issuance of an order of such removal or prohibition. In the event of such consent, or if upon the record made at any such hearing the Board shall find that any of the grounds specified in such notice have been established, the Board may issue such orders of suspension or removal from office, or prohibition from participation in the conduct of the affairs of the credit union, as it may deem appropriate. Any such order shall become effective at the expiration of thirty days after service upon such credit union and the director, committee member, officer, or other person concerned (except in the case of an order issued upon consent, which shall become effective at the time specified therein). Such order shall remain effective and enforceable except to such extent as it is stayed, modified, terminated, or set aside by action of the Board or a reviewing court.
<br>
<br>(5) Prohibition of certain specific activities.—Any person subject to an order issued under this subsection shall not—
<br>
<br>(A) participate in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of any institution or agency specified in paragraph (7)(A);

<br>(B) solicit, procure, transfer, attempt to transfer, vote, or attempt to vote any proxy, consent, or authorization with respect to any voting rights in any institution described in subparagraph (A);
<br>
<br>(C) violate any voting agreement previously approved by the appropriate Federal banking agency; or
<br>
<br>(D) vote for a director, or serve or act as an institution-affiliated party.
<br>
<br>(6) Within ten days after any director, officer, committee member, or other person has been suspended from office and/or prohibited from participation in the conduct of the affairs of an insured credit union under paragraph (3) of this subsection, such director, officer, committee member, or other person may apply to the United States district court for the judicial district in which the principal office of the credit union is located, or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, for a stay of such suspension and/or prohibition pending the completion of the administrative proceedings pursuant to the notice served upon such director, officer, committee member, or other person under paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection, and such court shall have jurisdiction to stay such suspension and/or prohibition.
<br>
<br>(7) Industrywide Prohibition.—
<br>
<br>(A) In general.—Except as provided in subparagraph (B), any person who, pursuant to an order issued under this subsection or subsection (i), has been removed or suspended from office in an insured credit union or prohibited from participating in the conduct of the affairs of an insured credit union may not, while such order is in effect, continue or commence to hold any office in, or participate in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of—
<br>
<br>(i) any insured depository institution;

<br>
<br>(B) Exception if agency provides written consent.—If, on or after the date an order is issued under this subsection which removes or suspends from office any institution-affiliated party or prohibits such party from participating in the conduct of the affairs of an insured credit union, such party receives the written consent of—
<br>
<br>(i) the Board; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the appropriate Federal financial institutions regulatory agency of the institution described in any clause of subparagraph (A) with respect to which such party proposes to become an institution-affiliated party,
<br>
<br>subparagraph (A) shall, to the extent of such consent, cease to apply to such party with respect to the institution described in each written consent. If any person receives such a written consent from the Board, the Board shall publicly disclose such consent. If the agency referred to in clause (ii) grants such a written consent, such agency shall report such action to the Board and publicly disclose such consent.
<br>
<br>(C) Violation of paragraph treated as violation of order.—Any violation of subparagraph (A) by any person who is subject to an order described in such subparagraph shall be treated as a violation of the order.

<br>
<br>(1) The Board may, ex parte without notice, appoint itself or another (including, in the case of a State-chartered insured credit union, the State official having jurisdiction over the credit union) as conservator and immediately take possession and control of the business and assets of any insured credit union in any case in which—
<br>
<br>(A) the Board determines that such action is necessary to conserve the assets of any insured credit union or to protect the Fund or the interests of the members of such insured credit union;
<br>
<br>(B) an insured credit union, by a resolution of its board of directors, consents to such an action by the Board;
<br>

<br>
<br>(G) the credit union is critically undercapitalized, as defined in section 1790d of this title.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (C), in the case of a State-chartered insured credit union, the authority conferred by paragraph (1) shall not be exercised without the written approval of the State official having jurisdiction over the State-chartered credit union that the grounds specified for such exercise exist.
<br>
<br>(B) If such approval has not been received by the Board within 30 days of receipt of notice by the State that the Board has determined such grounds exist, and the Board has responded in writing to the State's written reasons, if any, for withholding approval, then the Board may proceed without State approval only by a unanimous vote of the Board.
<br>

<br>(B) as such credit union is liquidated in accordance with the provisions of section 1787 of this title.
<br>
<br>(5) Except as provided in paragraph (3), in the case of an insured State-chartered credit union, the Board may maintain possession and control of the business and assets of such credit union and may operate such credit union until such time—

<br>
<br>(C) as such credit union is liquidated in accordance with the provisions of section 1787 of this title.
<br>
<br>(6) The Board may appoint such agents as it considers necessary in order to assist the Board in carrying out its duties as a conservator under this subsection.

<br>
<br>(A) In general.—Whenever any institution-affiliated party is charged in any information, indictment, or complaint, with the commission of or participation in—
<br>
<br>(i) a crime involving dishonesty or breach of trust which is punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year under State or Federal law, or
<br>
<br>(ii) a criminal violation of section 1956, 1957, or 1960 of title 18 or section 5322 or 5324 of title 31,
<br>
<br>the Board may, if continued service or participation by such party may pose a threat to the interests of the credit union's members or may threaten to impair public confidence in any credit union, by written notice served upon such party, suspend such party from office or prohibit such party from further participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of any credit union.
<br>
<br>(B) Provisions applicable to notice.—
<br>
<br>(i) Copy.—A copy of any notice under subparagraph (A) shall also be served upon the credit union of which the subject of the order is, or most recently was, an institution-affiliated party.
<br>
<br>(ii) Effective period.—A suspension or prohibition under subparagraph (A) shall remain in effect until the information, indictment, or complaint referred to in such subparagraph is finally disposed of or until terminated by the Board.
<br>
<br>(C) Removal or prohibition.—
<br>
<br>(i) In general.—If a judgment of conviction or an agreement to enter a pretrial diversion or other similar program is entered against an institution-affiliated party in connection with a crime described in subparagraph (A)(i), at such time as such judgment is not subject to further appellate review, the Board may, if continued service or participation by such party may pose a threat to the interests of any credit union's members or may threaten to impair public confidence in any credit union, issue and serve upon such party an order removing such party from office or prohibiting such party from further participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of any credit union without the prior written consent of the Board.
<br>
<br>(ii) Required for certain offenses—In the case of a judgment of conviction or agreement against an institution-affiliated party in connection with a violation described in subparagraph (A)(ii), the Board shall issue and serve upon such party an order removing such party from office or prohibiting such party from further participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of any credit union without the prior written consent of the Board.

<br>(D) Provisions applicable to order.—
<br>
<br>(i) Copy.—A copy of any order under subparagraph (C) shall also be served upon the credit union of which the subject of the order is, or most recently was, an institution-affiliated party, whereupon such party (if a director or an officer) shall cease to be a director or officer of such credit union.
<br>
<br>(ii) Effect of acquittal.—A finding of not guilty or other disposition of the charge shall not preclude the Board from instituting proceedings after such finding or disposition to remove such party from office or to prohibit further participation in credit union affairs, pursuant to paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of subsection (g) of this section.
<br>
<br>(iii) Effective period.—Any notice of suspension or order of removal issued under this paragraph shall remain effective and outstanding until the completion of any hearing or appeal authorized under paragraph (3) unless terminated by the Board.
<br>
<br>(E) Continuation of authority.—The Board may issue an order under this paragraph with respect to an individual who is an institution-affiliated party at a credit union at the time of an offense described in subparagraph (A) without regard to—
<br>
<br>(i) whether such individual is an institution-affiliated party at any credit union at the time the order is considered or issued by the Board; or
<br>
<br>(ii) whether the credit union at which the individual was an institution-affiliated party at the time of the offense remains in existence at the time the order is considered or issued by the Board.
<br>
<br>(2) If at any time, because of the suspension of one or more directors pursuant to this section, there shall be on the board of directors of a Federal credit union less than a quorum of directors not so suspended, all powers and functions vested in or exercisable by such board shall vest in and be exercisable by the director or directors on the board not so suspended, until such time as there shall be a quorum of the board of directors. In the event all of the directors of a Federal credit union are suspended pursuant to this section, the Board shall appoint persons to serve temporarily as directors in their place and stead pending the termination of such suspensions, or until such time as those who have been suspended cease to be directors of the credit union and their respective successors have been elected by the members at an annual or special meeting and have taken office. Directors appointed temporarily by the Board shall, within thirty days following their appointment, call a special meeting for the election of new directors, unless during the thirty-day period (A) the regular annual meeting is scheduled, or (B) the suspensions giving rise to the appointment of temporary directors are terminated.
<br>
<br>(3) Within thirty days from service of any notice of suspension or order of removal issued pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, the institution-affiliated party concerned may request in writing an opportunity to appear before the Board to show that the continued service to or participation in the conduct of the affairs of the credit union by such party does not, or is not likely to, pose a threat to the interests of the credit union's members or threaten to impair public confidence in the credit union. Upon receipt of any such request, the Board shall fix a time (not more than thirty days after receipt of such request, unless extended at the request of such party) and place at which such party may appear, personally or through counsel, before the Board or its designee to submit written materials (or, at the discretion of the Board, oral testimony) and oral argument. Within sixty days of such hearing, the Board shall notify such party whether the suspension or prohibition from participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of the credit union will be continued, terminated or otherwise modified, or whether the order removing such party from office or prohibiting such party from further participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of the credit union will be rescinded or otherwise modified. Such notification shall contain a statement of the basis for the Board's decision, if adverse to such party. The Board is authorized to prescribe such rules as may be necessary to effectuate the purposes of this subsection.

<br>
<br>(1) Any hearing provided for in this section (other than the hearing provided for in subsection (i)(3) of this section) shall be held in the Federal judicial district or in the territory in which the principal office of the credit union is located, unless the party afforded the hearing consents to another place, and shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of chapter 5 of title 5. After such hearing, and within ninety days after the Board has notified the parties that the case has been submitted to it for final decision, it shall render its decision (which shall include findings of fact upon which its decision is predicated) and shall issue and serve upon each party to the proceeding an order or orders consistent with the provisions of this section. Judicial review of any such order shall be exclusively as provided in this subsection (j). Unless a petition for review is timely filed in a court of appeals of the United States, as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, and thereafter until the record in the proceeding has been filed as so provided, the Board may at any time, upon such notice and in such manner as it may deem proper, modify, terminate, or set aside any such order. Upon such filing of the record, the Board may modify, terminate, or set aside any such order with permission of the court.
<br>
<br>(2) Any party to any proceeding under paragraph (1) may obtain a review of any order served pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection (other than an order issued with the consent of the credit union or the institution-affiliated party concerned or an order issued under subsection (i)(1) of this section) by filing in the court of appeals of the United States for the circuit in which the principal office of the credit union is located, or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, within thirty days after the date of service of such order, a written petition praying that the order of the Board be modified, terminated, or set aside. A copy of such petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Board, and thereupon the Board shall file in the court the record in the proceeding, as provided in section 2112 of title 28. Upon the filing of such petition, such court shall have jurisdiction, which upon the filing of the record shall, except as provided in the last sentence of said paragraph (1), be exclusive, to affirm, modify, terminate, or set aside, in whole or in part, the order of the Board. Review of such proceedings shall be had as provided in chapter 7 of title 5. The judgment and decree of the court shall be final, except that the same shall be subject to review by the Supreme Court upon certiorari, as provided in section 1254 of title 28.

However, except as otherwise provided in this section or section 1790d of this title, no court shall have jurisdiction to affect by injunction or otherwise the issuance or enforcement of any notice or order under this section or section 1790d of this title or to review, modify, suspend, terminate, or set aside any such notice or order.
