<br>§1363. Liability of substantial employer for withdrawal from single-employer plans under multiple controlled groups
<br>(a) Single-employer plans with two or more contributing sponsors
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subsection (d), the plan administrator of a single-employer plan which has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control—
<br>
<br>(1) shall notify the corporation of the withdrawal during a plan year of a substantial employer for such plan year from the plan, within 60 days after such withdrawal, and
<br>
<br>(2) request that the corporation determine the liability of all persons with respect to the withdrawal of the substantial employer.
<br>
<br>The corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, determine whether there is liability resulting from the withdrawal of the substantial employer and notify the liable persons of such liability.
<br>(b) Computation of liability
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subsection (c), any one or more contributing sponsors who withdraw, during a plan year for which they constitute a substantial employer, from a single-employer plan which has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control, shall, upon notification of such contributing sponsors by the corporation as provided by subsection (a), be liable, together with the members of their controlled groups, to the corporation in accordance with the provisions of section 1362 of this title and this section. The amount of liability shall be computed on the basis of an amount determined by the corporation to be the amount described in section 1362 of this title for the entire plan, as if the plan had been terminated by the corporation on the date of the withdrawal referred to in subsection (a)(1) multiplied by a fraction—
<br>
<br>(1) the numerator of which is the total amount required to be contributed to the plan by such contributing sponsors for the last 5 years ending prior to the withdrawal, and
<br>
<br>(2) the denominator of which is the total amount required to be contributed to the plan by all contributing sponsors for such last 5 years.
<br>
<br>In addition to and in lieu of the manner prescribed in the preceding sentence, the corporation may also determine such liability on any other equitable basis prescribed by the corporation in regulations. Any amount collected by the corporation under this subsection shall be held in escrow subject to disposition in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (c).
<br>(c) Bond in lieu of payment of liability; 5-year termination period
<br>
<br>(1) In lieu of payment of a contributing sponsor's liability under this section, the contributing sponsor may be required to furnish a bond to the corporation in an amount not exceeding 150 percent of his liability to insure payment of his liability under this section. The bond shall have as surety thereon a corporate surety company which is an acceptable surety on Federal bonds under authority granted by the Secretary of the Treasury under sections 9304–9308 of title 31. Any such bond shall be in a form or of a type approved by the Secretary including individual bonds or schedule or blanket forms of bonds which cover a group or class.
<br>
<br>(2) If the plan is not terminated under section 1341(c) or 1342 of this title within the 5-year period commencing on the day of withdrawal, the liability is abated and any payment held in escrow shall be refunded without interest (or the bond cancelled) in accordance with bylaws or rules prescribed by the corporation.
<br>
<br>(3) If the plan terminates under section 1341(c) or 1342 of this title within the 5-year period commencing on the day of withdrawal, the corporation shall—
<br>
<br>(A) demand payment or realize on the bond and hold such amount in escrow for the benefit of the plan;
<br>
<br>(B) treat any escrowed payments under this section as if they were plan assets and apply them in a manner consistent with this subtitle; and
<br>
<br>(C) refund any amount to the contributing sponsor which is not required to meet any obligation of the corporation with respect to the plan.
<br>(d) Alternate appropriate procedure
<br>
<br>The provisions of this subsection apply in the case of a withdrawal described in subsection (a), and the provisions of subsections (b) and (c) shall not apply, if the corporation determines that the procedure provided for under this subsection is consistent with the purposes of this section and section 1364 of this title and is more appropriate in the particular case. Upon a showing by the plan administrator of the plan that the withdrawal from the plan by one or more contributing sponsors has resulted, or will result, in a significant reduction in the amount of aggregate contributions to or under the plan, the corporation may—
<br>
<br>(1) require the plan fund to be equitably allocated between those participants no longer working in covered service under the plan as a result of the withdrawal, and those participants who remain in covered service under the plan;
<br>
<br>(2) treat that portion of the plan funds allocable under paragraph (1) to participants no longer in covered service as a plan terminated under section 1342 of this title; and
<br>
<br>(3) treat that portion of the plan fund allocable to participants remaining in covered service as a separate plan.
<br>(e) Indemnity agreement
<br>
<br>The corporation is authorized to waive the application of the provisions of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section whenever it determines that there is an indemnity agreement in effect among contributing sponsors under the plan which is adequate to satisfy the purposes of this section and of section 1364 of this title.

<br>§1368. Lien for liability

<br>
<br>If any person liable to the corporation under section 1362, 1363, or 1364 of this title neglects or refuses to pay, after demand, the amount of such liability (including interest), there shall be a lien in favor of the corporation in the amount of such liability (including interest) upon all property and rights to property, whether real or personal, belonging to such person, except that such lien may not be in an amount in excess of 30 percent of the collective net worth of all persons described in section 1362(a) of this title 1
<br>(b) Term of lien
<br>
<br>The lien imposed by subsection (a) arises on the date of termination of a plan, and continues until the liability imposed under section 1362, 1363, or 1364 of this title is satisfied or becomes unenforceable by reason of lapse of time.
<br>(c) Priority
<br>
<br>(1) Except as otherwise provided under this section, the priority of a lien imposed under subsection (a) shall be determined in the same manner as under section 6323 of title 26 (as in effect on April 7, 1986). Such section 6323 shall be applied for purposes of this section by disregarding subsection (g)(4) and by substituting—
<br>
<br>(A) "lien imposed by section 4068 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 [29 U.S.C. 1368]" for "lien imposed by section 6321" each place it appears in subsections (a), (b), (c)(1), (c)(4)(B), (d), (e), and (h)(5);
<br>
<br>(B) "the corporation" for "the Secretary" in subsections (a) and (b)(9)(C);
<br>
<br>(C) "the payment of the amount on which the section 4068(a) lien is based" for "the collection of any tax under this title" in subsection (b)(3);
<br>
<br>(D) "a person whose property is subject to the lien" for "the taxpayer" in subsections (b)(8), (c)(2)(A)(i) (the first place it appears), (c)(2)(A)(ii), (c)(2)(B), (c)(4)(B), and (c)(4)(C) (in the matter preceding clause (i));
<br>
<br>(E) "such person" for "the taxpayer" in subsections (c)(2)(A)(i) (the second place it appears) and (c)(4)(C)(ii);
<br>
<br>(F) "payment of the loan value of the amount on which the lien is based is made to the corporation" for "satisfaction of a levy pursuant to section 6332(b)" in subsection (b)(9)(C);
<br>
<br>(G) "section 4068(a) lien" for "tax lien" each place it appears in subsections (c)(1), (c)(2)(A), (c)(2)(B), (c)(3)(B)(iii), (c)(4)(B), (d), and (h)(5); and
<br>
<br>(H) "the date on which the lien is first filed" for "the date of the assessment of the tax" in subsection (g)(3)(A).
<br>
<br>(2) In a case under title 11 or in insolvency proceedings, the lien imposed under subsection (a) shall be treated in the same manner as a tax due and owing to the United States for purposes of title 11 or section 3713 of title 31.
<br>
<br>(3) For purposes of applying section 6323(a) of title 26 to determine the priority between the lien imposed under subsection (a) and a Federal tax lien, each lien shall be treated as a judgment lien arising as of the time notice of such lien is filed.
<br>
<br>(4) For purposes of this subsection, notice of the lien imposed by subsection (a) shall be filed in the same manner as under section 6323(f) and (g) of title 26.
<br>(d) Civil action; limitation period
<br>
<br>(1) In any case where there has been a refusal or neglect to pay the liability imposed under section 1362, 1363, or 1364 of this title, the corporation may bring civil action in a district court of the United States to enforce the lien of the corporation under this section with respect to such liability or to subject any property, of whatever nature, of the liable person, or in which he has any right, title, or interest to the payment of such liability.
<br>
<br>(2) The liability imposed by section 1362, 1363, or 1364 of this title may be collected by a proceeding in court if the proceeding is commenced within 6 years after the date upon which the plan was terminated or prior to the expiration of any period for collection agreed upon in writing by the corporation and the liable person before the expiration of such 6-year period. The period of limitations provided under this paragraph shall be suspended for the period the assets of the liable person are in the control or custody of any court of the United States, or of any State, or of the District of Columbia, and for 6 months thereafter, and for any period during which the liable person is outside the United States if such period of absence is for a continuous period of at least 6 months.
<br>(e) Release or subordination
<br>
<br>If the corporation determines that release of the lien or subordination of the lien to any other creditor of the liable person would not adversely affect the collection of the liability imposed under section 1362, 1363, or 1364 of this title, or that the amount realizable by the corporation from the property to which the lien attaches will ultimately be increased by such release or subordination, and that the ultimate collection of the liability will be facilitated by such release or subordination, the corporation may issue a certificate of release or subordination of the lien with respect to such property, or any part thereof.
<br>(f) Definitions
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section—
<br>
<br>(1) The collective net worth of persons subject to liability in connection with a plan termination shall be determined as provided in section 1362(d)(1) of this title.
<br>
<br>(2) The term "pre-tax profits" has the meaning provided in section 1362(d)(2) of this title.

<br>
<br>If a principal purpose of any person in entering into any transaction is to evade liability to which such person would be subject under this subtitle and the transaction becomes effective within five years before the termination date of the termination on which such liability would be based, then such person and the members of such person's controlled group (determined as of the termination date) shall be subject to liability under this subtitle in connection with such termination as if such person were a contributing sponsor of the terminated plan as of the termination date. This subsection shall not cause any person to be liable under this subtitle in connection with such plan termination for any increases or improvements in the benefits provided under the plan which are adopted after the date on which the transaction referred to in the preceding sentence becomes effective.
<br>(b) Effect of corporate reorganization
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subtitle, the following rules apply in the case of certain corporate reorganizations:
<br>(1) Change of identity, form, etc.
<br>
<br>If a person ceases to exist by reason of a reorganization which involves a mere change in identity, form, or place of organization, however effected, a successor corporation resulting from such reorganization shall be treated as the person to whom this subtitle applies.
<br>(2) Liquidation into parent corporation
<br>
<br>If a person ceases to exist by reason of liquidation into a parent corporation, the parent corporation shall be treated as the person to whom this subtitle applies.

<br>§1370. Enforcement authority relating to terminations of single-employer plans
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>Any person who is with respect to a single-employer plan a fiduciary, contributing sponsor, member of a contributing sponsor's controlled group, participant, or beneficiary, and is adversely affected by an act or practice of any party (other than the corporation) in violation of any provision of section 1341, 1342, 1362, 1363, 1364, or 1369 of this title, or who is an employee organization representing such a participant or beneficiary so adversely affected for purposes of collective bargaining with respect to such plan, may bring an action—
<br>
<br>(1) to enjoin such act or practice, or
<br>
<br>(2) to obtain other appropriate equitable relief (A) to redress such violation or (B) to enforce such provision.
<br>(b) Status of plan as party to action and with respect to legal process
<br>
<br>A single-employer plan may be sued under this section as an entity. Service of summons, subpoena, or other legal process of a court upon a trustee or an administrator of a single-employer plan in such trustee's or administrator's capacity as such shall constitute service upon the plan. If a plan has not designated in the summary plan description of the plan an individual as agent for the service of legal process, service upon any contributing sponsor of the plan shall constitute such service. Any money judgment under this section against a single-employer plan shall be enforceable only against the plan as an entity and shall not be enforceable against any other person unless liability against such person is established in such person's individual capacity.
<br>(c) Jurisdiction and venue
<br>
<br>The district courts of the United States shall have exclusive jurisdiction of civil actions under this section. Such actions may be brought in the district where the plan is administered, where the violation took place, or where a defendant resides or may be found, and process may be served in any other district where a defendant resides or may be found. The district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction, without regard to the amount in controversy or the citizenship of the parties, to grant the relief provided for in subsection (a) in any action.
<br>(d) Right of corporation to intervene
<br>
<br>A copy of the complaint or notice of appeal in any action under this section shall be served upon the corporation by certified mail. The corporation shall have the right in its discretion to intervene in any action.
<br>(e) Awards of costs and expenses
<br>(1) General rule
<br>
<br>In any action brought under this section, the court in its discretion may award all or a portion of the costs and expenses incurred in connection with such action, including reasonable attorney's fees, to any party who prevails or substantially prevails in such action.
<br>(2) Exemption for plans
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this subsection, no plan shall be required in any action to pay any costs and expenses (including attorney's fees).
<br>(f) Limitation on actions
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in paragraph (3), an action under this section may not be brought after the later of—
<br>
<br>(A) 6 years after the date on which the cause of action arose, or
<br>
<br>(B) 3 years after the applicable date specified in paragraph (2).
<br>(2) Applicable date
<br>(A) General rule
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the applicable date specified in this paragraph is the earliest date on which the plaintiff acquired or should have acquired actual knowledge of the existence of such cause of action.
<br>(B) Special rule for plaintiffs who are fiduciaries
<br>
<br>In the case of a plaintiff who is a fiduciary bringing the action in the exercise of fiduciary duties, the applicable date specified in this paragraph is the date on which the plaintiff became a fiduciary with respect to the plan if such date is later than the date described in subparagraph (A).
<br>(3) Cases of fraud or concealment
<br>
<br>In the case of fraud or concealment, the period described in paragraph (1)(B) shall be extended to 6 years after the applicable date specified in paragraph (2).

<br>
<br>Pub. L. 98–369, div. A, title V, §558(a), (c), (d), July 18, 1984, 98 Stat. 899, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(a) In General.—
<br>
<br>"(1) Liability.—Any withdrawal liability incurred by an employer pursuant to part 1 of subtitle E of title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1381 et seq.) as a result of the complete or partial withdrawal of such employer from a multiemployer plan before September 26, 1980, shall be void.
<br>
<br>"(2) Refunds.—Any amounts paid by an employer to a plan sponsor as a result of such withdrawal liability shall be refunded by the plan sponsor to the employer with interest (in accordance with section 401(a)(2) [26 U.S.C. 401(a)(2)]), less a reasonable amount for administrative expenses incurred by the plan sponsor (other than legal expenses incurred with respect to the plan) in calculating, assessing, and refunding such amounts.
<br>
<br>"(c) No Increase in Liability.—The amendments made by this section [amending sections 1391, 1397, 1399, 1415 and 1461 of this title and provisions set out as a note under section 1385 of this title] shall not be construed to increase the liability incurred by any employer pursuant to part 1 of subtitle E of title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1381 et seq.), as in effect immediately before the amendments made by subsection (b) [amending sections 1391, 1397, 1399, 1415, and 1461 of this title and provisions set out as a note under section 1385 of this title], as a result of the complete or partial withdrawal of such employer from a multiemployer plan prior to September 26, 1980.
<br>
<br>"(d) Special Rule for Certain Binding Agreements.—In the case of an employer who, on September 26, 1980, has a binding agreement to withdraw from a multiemployer plan, subsection (a)(1) shall be applied by substituting 'December 31, 1980' for 'September 26, 1980'."
<br>Applicability to Certain Employers Withdrawn Before Sept. 26, 1980, From Multiemployer Plan Covering Employees in Seagoing Industry; Effective Date, Coverage, Etc.
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 96–364, title I, §108(c)(4), Sept. 26, 1980, 94 Stat. 1269, provided that: "In the case of an employer who withdrew before the date of enactment of this Act [Sept. 26, 1980] from a multiemployer plan covering employees in the seagoing industry (as determined by the corporation), sections 4201 through 4219 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as added by this Act, [section 1381 through 1399 of this title], are effective as of May 3, 1979. For the purpose of applying section 4217 [section 1397 of this title] for purposes of the preceding sentence, the date 'May 2, 1979,' shall be substituted for 'April 28, 1980,' and the date 'May 3, 1979' shall be substituted for 'April 29, 1980'. For purposes of this paragraph, terms which are used in title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 [this subchapter], or in regulations prescribed under that title, and which are used in the preceding sentence have the same meaning as when used in that Act [see Short Title note set out under sections 1001 of this title] or those regulations. For purposes of this paragraph, the term 'employer' includes only a substantial employer covering employees in the seagoing industry (as so determined) in connection with ports on the West Coast of the United States, but does not include an employer who withdrew from a plan because of a change in the collective bargaining representative."
<br>§1382. Determination and collection of liability; notification of employer
<br>
<br>When an employer withdraws from a multiemployer plan, the plan sponsor, in accordance with this part, shall—
<br>
<br>(1) determine the amount of the employer's withdrawal liability,
<br>
<br>(2) notify the employer of the amount of the withdrawal liability, and
<br>
<br>(3) collect the amount of the withdrawal liability from the employer.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 93–406, title IV, §4202, as added Pub. L. 96–364, title I, §104(2), Sept. 26, 1980, 94 Stat. 1218.)
<br>§1383. Complete withdrawal
<br>(a) Determinative factors
<br>
<br>For purposes of this part, a complete withdrawal from a multiemployer plan occurs when an employer—
<br>
<br>(1) permanently ceases to have an obligation to contribute under the plan, or
<br>
<br>(2) permanently ceases all covered operations under the plan.
<br>(b) Building and construction industry
<br>
<br>(1) Notwithstanding subsection (a), in the case of an employer that has an obligation to contribute under a plan for work performed in the building and construction industry, a complete withdrawal occurs only as described in paragraph (2), if—
<br>
<br>(A) substantially all the employees with respect to whom the employer has an obligation to contribute under the plan perform work in the building and construction industry, and
<br>
<br>(B) the plan—
<br>
<br>(i) primarily covers employees in the building and construction industry, or
<br>
<br>(ii) is amended to provide that this subsection applies to employers described in this paragraph.
<br>
<br>(2) A withdrawal occurs under this paragraph if—
<br>
<br>(A) an employer ceases to have an obligation to contribute under the plan, and
<br>
<br>(B) the employer—
<br>
<br>(i) continues to perform work in the jurisdiction of the collective bargaining agreement of the type for which contributions were previously required, or
<br>
<br>(ii) resumes such work within 5 years after the date on which the obligation to contribute under the plan ceases, and does not renew the obligation at the time of the resumption.
<br>
<br>(3) In the case of a plan terminated by mass withdrawal (within the meaning of section 1341a(a)(2) of this title), paragraph (2) shall be applied by substituting "3 years" for "5 years" in subparagraph (B)(ii).
<br>(c) Entertainment industry
<br>
<br>(1) Notwithstanding subsection (a), in the case of an employer that has an obligation to contribute under a plan for work performed in the entertainment industry, primarily on a temporary or project-by-project basis, if the plan primarily covers employees in the entertainment industry, a complete withdrawal occurs only as described in subsection (b)(2) applied by substituting "plan" for "collective bargaining agreement" in subparagraph (B)(i) thereof.
<br>
<br>(2) For purposes of this subsection, the term "entertainment industry" means—
<br>
<br>(A) theater, motion picture (except to the extent provided in regulations prescribed by the corporation), radio, television, sound or visual recording, music, and dance, and
<br>
<br>(B) such other entertainment activities as the corporation may determine to be appropriate.
<br>
<br>(3) The corporation may by regulation exclude a group or class of employers described in the preceding sentence from the application of this subsection if the corporation determines that such exclusion is necessary—
<br>
<br>(A) to protect the interest of the plan's participants and beneficiaries, or
<br>
<br>(B) to prevent a significant risk of loss to the corporation with respect to the plan.
<br>
<br>(4) A plan may be amended to provide that this subsection shall not apply to a group or class of employers under the plan.
<br>(d) Other determinative factors
<br>
<br>(1) Notwithstanding subsection (a), in the case of an employer who—
<br>
<br>(A) has an obligation to contribute under a plan described in paragraph (2) primarily for work described in such paragraph, and
<br>
<br>(B) does not continue to perform work within the jurisdiction of the plan,
<br>
<br>a complete withdrawal occurs only as described in paragraph (3).
<br>
<br>(2) A plan is described in this paragraph if substantially all of the contributions required under the plan are made by employers primarily engaged in the long and short haul trucking industry, the household goods moving industry, or the public warehousing industry.
<br>
<br>(3) A withdrawal occurs under this paragraph if—
<br>
<br>(A) an employer permanently ceases to have an obligation to contribute under the plan or permanently ceases all covered operations under the plan, and
<br>
<br>(B) either—
<br>
<br>(i) the corporation determines that the plan has suffered substantial damage to its contribution base as a result of such cessation, or
<br>
<br>(ii) the employer fails to furnish a bond issued by a corporate surety company that is an acceptable surety for purposes of section 1112 of this title, or an amount held in escrow by a bank or similar financial institution satisfactory to the plan, in an amount equal to 50 percent of the withdrawal liability of the employer.
<br>
<br>(4) If, after an employer furnishes a bond or escrow to a plan under paragraph (3)(B)(ii), the corporation determines that the cessation of the employer's obligation to contribute under the plan (considered together with any cessations by other employers), or cessation of covered operations under the plan, has resulted in substantial damage to the contribution base of the plan, the employer shall be treated as having withdrawn from the plan on the date on which the obligation to contribute or covered operations ceased, and such bond or escrow shall be paid to the plan. The corporation shall not make a determination under this paragraph more than 60 months after the date on which such obligation to contribute or covered operations ceased.
<br>
<br>(5) If the corporation determines that the employer has no further liability under the plan either—
<br>
<br>(A) because it determines that the contribution base of the plan has not suffered substantial damage as a result of the cessation of the employer's obligation to contribute or cessation of covered operations (considered together with any cessation of contribution obligation, or of covered operations, with respect to other employers), or
<br>
<br>(B) because it may not make a determination under paragraph (4) because of the last sentence thereof,
<br>
<br>then the bond shall be cancelled or the escrow refunded.
<br>
<br>(6) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as a limitation on the amount of the withdrawal liability of any employer.
<br>(e) Date of complete withdrawal
<br>
<br>For purposes of this part, the date of a complete withdrawal is the date of the cessation of the obligation to contribute or the cessation of covered operations.
<br>(f) Special liability withdrawal rules for industries other than construction and entertainment industries; procedures applicable to amend plans
<br>
<br>(1) The corporation may prescribe regulations under which plans in industries other than the construction or entertainment industries may be amended to provide for special withdrawal liability rules similar to the rules described in subsections (b) and (c).
<br>
<br>(2) Regulations under paragraph (1) shall permit use of special withdrawal liability rules—
<br>
<br>(A) only in industries (or portions thereof) in which, as determined by the corporation, the characteristics that would make use of such rules appropriate are clearly shown, and
<br>
<br>(B) only if the corporation determines, in each instance in which special withdrawal liability rules are permitted, that use of such rules will not pose a significant risk to the corporation under this subchapter.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 93–406, title IV, §4203, as added Pub. L. 96–364, title I, §104(2), Sept. 26, 1980, 94 Stat. 1218.)
<br>§1384. Sale of assets
<br>(a) Complete or partial withdrawal not occurring as a result of sale and subsequent cessation of covered operations or cessation of obligation to contribute to covered operations; continuation of liability of seller
<br>
<br>(1) A complete or partial withdrawal of an employer (hereinafter in this section referred to as the "seller") under this section does not occur solely because, as a result of a bona fide, arm's-length sale of assets to an unrelated party (hereinafter in this section referred to as the "purchaser"), the seller ceases covered operations or ceases to have an obligation to contribute for such operations, if—
<br>
<br>(A) the purchaser has an obligation to contribute to the plan with respect to the operations for substantially the same number of contribution base units for which the seller had an obligation to contribute to the plan;
<br>
<br>(B) the purchaser provides to the plan for a period of 5 plan years commencing with the first plan year beginning after the sale of assets, a bond issued by a corporate surety company that is an acceptable surety for purposes of section 1112 of this title, or an amount held in escrow by a bank or similar financial institution satisfactory to the plan, in an amount equal to the greater of—
<br>
<br>(i) the average annual contribution required to be made by the seller with respect to the operations under the plan for the 3 plan years preceding the plan year in which the sale of the employer's assets occurs, or
<br>
<br>(ii) the annual contribution that the seller was required to make with respect to the operations under the plan for the last plan year before the plan year in which the sale of the assets occurs,
<br>
<br>which bond or escrow shall be paid to the plan if the purchaser withdraws from the plan, or fails to make a contribution to the plan when due, at any time during the first 5 plan years beginning after the sale; and
<br>
<br>(C) the contract for sale provides that, if the purchaser withdraws in a complete withdrawal, or a partial withdrawal with respect to operations, during such first 5 plan years, the seller is secondarily liable for any withdrawal liability it would have had to the plan with respect to the operations (but for this section) if the liability of the purchaser with respect to the plan is not paid.
<br>
<br>(2) If the purchaser—
<br>
<br>(A) withdraws before the last day of the fifth plan year beginning after the sale, and
<br>
<br>(B) fails to make any withdrawal liability payment when due,
<br>
<br>then the seller shall pay to the plan an amount equal to the payment that would have been due from the seller but for this section.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) If all, or substantially all, of the seller's assets are distributed, or if the seller is liquidated before the end of the 5 plan year period described in paragraph (1)(C), then the seller shall provide a bond or amount in escrow equal to the present value of the withdrawal liability the seller would have had but for this subsection.
<br>
<br>(B) If only a portion of the seller's assets are distributed during such period, then a bond or escrow shall be required, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the corporation, in a manner consistent with subparagraph (A).
<br>
<br>(4) The liability of the party furnishing a bond or escrow under this subsection shall be reduced, upon payment of the bond or escrow to the plan, by the amount thereof.
<br>(b) Liability of purchaser
<br>
<br>(1) For the purposes of this part, the liability of the purchaser shall be determined as if the purchaser had been required to contribute to the plan in the year of the sale and the 4 plan years preceding the sale the amount the seller was required to contribute for such operations for such 5 plan years.
<br>
<br>(2) If the plan is in reorganization in the plan year in which the sale of assets occurs, the purchaser shall furnish a bond or escrow in an amount equal to 200 percent of the amount described in subsection (a)(1)(B).
<br>(c) Variances or exemptions from continuation of liability of seller; procedures applicable
<br>
<br>The corporation may by regulation vary the standards in subparagraphs (B) and (C) of subsection (a)(1) if the variance would more effectively or equitably carry out the purposes of this subchapter. Before it promulgates such regulations, the corporation may grant individual or class variances or exemptions from the requirements of such subparagraphs if the particular case warrants it. Before granting such an individual or class variance or exemption, the corporation—
<br>
<br>(1) shall publish notice in the Federal Register of the pendency of the variance or exemption,
<br>
<br>(2) shall require that adequate notice be given to interested persons, and
<br>
<br>(3) shall afford interested persons an opportunity to present their views.
<br>(d) "Unrelated party" defined
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, the term "unrelated party" means a purchaser or seller who does not bear a relationship to the seller or purchaser, as the case may be, that is described in section 267(b) of title 26, or that is described in regulations prescribed by the corporation applying principles similar to the principles of such section.

<br>§1385. Partial withdrawals
<br>(a) Determinative factors
<br>
<br>Except as otherwise provided in this section, there is a partial withdrawal by an employer from a plan on the last day of a plan year if for such plan year—
<br>
<br>(1) there is a 70-percent contribution decline, or
<br>
<br>(2) there is a partial cessation of the employer's contribution obligation.
<br>(b) Criteria applicable
<br>
<br>For purposes of subsection (a)—
<br>
<br>(1)(A) There is a 70-percent contribution decline for any plan year if during each plan year in the 3-year testing period the employer's contribution base units do not exceed 30 percent of the employer's contribution base units for the high base year.
<br>
<br>(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A)—
<br>
<br>(i) The term "3-year testing period" means the period consisting of the plan year and the immediately preceding 2 plan years.
<br>
<br>(ii) The number of contribution base units for the high base year is the average number of such units for the 2 plan years for which the employer's contribution base units were the highest within the 5 plan years immediately preceding the beginning of the 3-year testing period.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) There is a partial cessation of the employer's contribution obligation for the plan year if, during such year—
<br>
<br>(i) the employer permanently ceases to have an obligation to contribute under one or more but fewer than all collective bargaining agreements under which the employer has been obligated to contribute under the plan but continues to perform work in the jurisdiction of the collective bargaining agreement of the type for which contributions were previously required or transfers such work to another location or to an entity or entities owned or controlled by the employer, or
<br>
<br>(ii) an employer permanently ceases to have an obligation to contribute under the plan with respect to work performed at one or more but fewer than all of its facilities, but continues to perform work at the facility of the type for which the obligation to contribute ceased.
<br>
<br>(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), a cessation of obligations under a collective bargaining agreement shall not be considered to have occurred solely because, with respect to the same plan, one agreement that requires contributions to the plan has been substituted for another agreement.
<br>(c) Retail food industry
<br>
<br>(1) In the case of a plan in which a majority of the covered employees are employed in the retail food industry, the plan may be amended to provide that this section shall be applied with respect to such plan—
<br>
<br>(A) by substituting "35 percent" for "70 percent" in subsections (a) and (b), and
<br>
<br>(B) by substituting "65 percent" for "30 percent" in subsection (b).
<br>
<br>(2) Any amendment adopted under paragraph (1) shall provide rules for the equitable reduction of withdrawal liability in any case in which the number of the plan's contribution base units, in the 2 plan years following the plan year of withdrawal of the employer, is higher than such number immediately after the withdrawal.
<br>
<br>(3) Section 1388 of this title shall not apply to a plan which has been amended under paragraph (1).
<br>(d) Continuation of liability of employer for partial withdrawal under amended plan
<br>
<br>In the case of a plan described in section 404(c) of title 26, or a continuation thereof, the plan may be amended to provide rules setting forth other conditions consistent with the purposes of this chapter under which an employer has liability for partial withdrawal.

<br>Liability of Certain Employers Announcing Publicly Before December 13, 1979, Total Cessation of Covered Operations at a Facility in a State; Amount, Coverage, Determinative Factors, Etc.
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 96–364, title I, §108(e), Sept. 26, 1980, 94 Stat. 1269, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(1) In the case of a partial withdrawal under section 4205 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 [this section], an employer who—
<br>
<br>"(A) before December 13, 1979, had publicly announced the total cessation of covered operations at a facility in a State (and such cessation occurred within 12 months after the announcement),
<br>
<br>"(B) had not been obligated to make contributions to the plan on behalf of the employees at such facility for more than 8 years before the discontinuance of contributions, and

<br>"(C) after the discontinuance of contributions does not within 1 year after the date of the partial withdrawal perform work in the same State of the type for which contributions were previously required,
<br>
<br>shall be liable under such section with respect to such partial withdrawal in an amount not greater than the amount determined under paragraph (2).
<br>
<br>"(2) The amount determined under this paragraph is the excess (if any) of—
<br>
<br>"(A) the present value (on the withdrawal date) of the benefits under the plan which—
<br>
<br>"(i) were vested on the withdrawal date (or, if earlier, at the time of separation from service with the employer at the facility),
<br>
<br>"(ii) were accrued by employees who on December 13, 1979 (or, if earlier, at the time of separation from service with the employer at the facility), were employed at the facility, and
<br>
<br>"(iii) are attributable to service with the withdrawing employer, over
<br>
<br>"(B)(i) the sum of—
<br>
<br>"(I) all employer contributions to the plan on behalf of employees at the facility before the withdrawal date,
<br>
<br>"(II) interest (to the withdrawal date) on amounts described in subclause (I), and

<br>"(II) interest (to the withdrawal date) on amounts described in subclause (I).
<br>
<br>"(3) For purposes of paragraph (2)—
<br>
<br>"(A) actuarial assumptions shall be those used in the last actuarial report completed before December 13, 1979,
<br>
<br>"(B) the term 'withdrawal date' means the date on which the employer ceased work at the facility of the type for which contributions were previously required, and
<br>
<br>"(C) the term 'facility' means the facility referred to in paragraph (1)."
<br>§1386. Adjustment for partial withdrawal; determination of amount; reduction for partial withdrawal liability; procedures applicable
<br>
<br>(a) The amount of an employer's liability for a partial withdrawal, before the application of sections 1399(c)(1) and 1405 of this title, is equal to the product of—
<br>
<br>(1) the amount determined under section 1391 of this title, and adjusted under section 1389 of this title if appropriate, determined as if the employer had withdrawn from the plan in a complete withdrawal—
<br>
<br>(A) on the date of the partial withdrawal, or
<br>
<br>(B) in the case of a partial withdrawal described in section 1385(a)(1) of this title (relating to 70-percent contribution decline), on the last day of the first plan year in the 3-year testing period,
<br>
<br>multiplied by
<br>
<br>(2) a fraction which is 1 minus a fraction—
<br>
<br>(A) the numerator of which is the employer's contribution base units for the plan year following the plan year in which the partial withdrawal occurs, and
<br>
<br>(B) the denominator of which is the average of the employer's contribution base units for—
<br>
<br>(i) except as provided in clause (ii), the 5 plan years immediately preceding the plan year in which the partial withdrawal occurs, or
<br>
<br>(ii) in the case of a partial withdrawal described in section 1385(a)(1) of this title (relating to 70-percent contribution decline), the 5 plan years immediately preceding the beginning of the 3-year testing period.
<br>
<br>(b)(1) In the case of an employer that has withdrawal liability for a partial withdrawal from a plan, any withdrawal liability of that employer for a partial or complete withdrawal from that plan in a subsequent plan year shall be reduced by the amount of any partial withdrawal liability (reduced by any abatement or reduction of such liability) of the employer with respect to the plan for a previous plan year.
<br>
<br>(2) The corporation shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to provide for proper adjustments in the reduction provided by paragraph (1) for—
<br>
<br>(A) changes in unfunded vested benefits arising after the close of the prior year for which partial withdrawal liability was determined,
<br>
<br>(B) changes in contribution base units occurring after the close of the prior year for which partial withdrawal liability was determined, and
<br>
<br>(C) any other factors for which it determines adjustment to be appropriate,
<br>
<br>so that the liability for any complete or partial withdrawal in any subsequent year (after the application of the reduction) properly reflects the employer's share of liability with respect to the plan.

<br>§1387. Reduction or waiver of complete withdrawal liability; procedures and standards applicable
<br>
<br>(a) The corporation shall provide by regulation for the reduction or waiver of liability for a complete withdrawal in the event that an employer who has withdrawn from a plan subsequently resumes covered operations under the plan or renews an obligation to contribute under the plan, to the extent that the corporation determines that reduction or waiver of withdrawal liability is consistent with the purposes of this chapter.
<br>
<br>(b) The corporation shall prescribe by regulation a procedure and standards for the amendment of plans to provide alternative rules for the reduction or waiver of liability for a complete withdrawal in the event that an employer who has withdrawn from the plan subsequently resumes covered operations or renews an obligation to contribute under the plan. The rules may apply only to the extent that the rules are consistent with the purposes of this chapter.

<br>§1388. Reduction of partial withdrawal liability
<br>(a) Obligation of employer for payments for partial withdrawal for plan years beginning after the second consecutive plan year following the partial withdrawal year; criteria applicable; furnishing of bond in lieu of payment of partial withdrawal liability
<br>
<br>(1) If, for any 2 consecutive plan years following the plan year in which an employer has partially withdrawn from a plan under section 1385(a)(1) of this title (referred to elsewhere in this section as the "partial withdrawal year"), the number of contribution base units with respect to which the employer has an obligation to contribute under the plan for each such year is not less than 90 percent of the total number of contribution base units with respect to which the employer had an obligation to contribute under the plan for the high base year (within the meaning of section 1385(b)(1)(B)(ii) of this title), then the employer shall have no obligation to make payments with respect to such partial withdrawal (other than delinquent payments) for plan years beginning after the second consecutive plan year following the partial withdrawal year.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) For any plan year for which the number of contribution base units with respect to which an employer who has partially withdrawn under section 1385(a)(1) of this title has an obligation to contribute under the plan equals or exceeds the number of units for the highest year determined under paragraph (1) without regard to "90 percent of", the employer may furnish (in lieu of payment of the partial withdrawal liability determined under section 1386 of this title) a bond to the plan in the amount determined by the plan sponsor (not exceeding 50 percent of the annual payment otherwise required).
<br>
<br>(B) If the plan sponsor determines under paragraph (1) that the employer has no further liability to the plan for the partial withdrawal, then the bond shall be cancelled.
<br>
<br>(C) If the plan sponsor determines under paragraph (1) that the employer continues to have liability to the plan for the partial withdrawal, then—
<br>
<br>(i) the bond shall be paid to the plan,
<br>
<br>(ii) the employer shall immediately be liable for the outstanding amount of liability due with respect to the plan year for which the bond was posted, and
<br>
<br>(iii) the employer shall continue to make the partial withdrawal liability payments as they are due.
<br>(b) Obligation of employer for payments for partial withdrawal for plan years beginning after the second consecutive plan year; other criteria applicable
<br>
<br>If—
<br>
<br>(1) for any 2 consecutive plan years following a partial withdrawal under section 1385(a)(1) of this title, the number of contribution base units with respect to which the employer has an obligation to contribute for each such year exceeds 30 percent of the total number of contribution base units with respect to which the employer had an obligation to contribute for the high base year (within the meaning of section 1385(b)(1)(B)(ii) of this title,1 and
<br>
<br>(2) the total number of contribution base units with respect to which all employers under the plan have obligations to contribute in each of such 2 consecutive years is not less than 90 percent of the total number of contribution base units for which all employers had obligations to contribute in the partial withdrawal plan year;
<br>
<br>then, the employer shall have no obligation to make payments with respect to such partial withdrawal (other than delinquent payments) for plan years beginning after the second such consecutive plan year.
<br>(c) Pro rata reduction of amount of partial withdrawal liability payment of employer for plan year following partial withdrawal year
<br>
<br>In any case in which, in any plan year following a partial withdrawal under section 1385(a)(1) of this title, the number of contribution base units with respect to which the employer has an obligation to contribute for such year equals or exceeds 110 percent (or such other percentage as the plan may provide by amendment and which is not prohibited under regulations prescribed by the corporation) of the number of contribution base units with respect to which the employer had an obligation to contribute in the partial withdrawal year, then the amount of the employer's partial withdrawal liability payment for such year shall be reduced pro rata, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the corporation.
<br>(d) Building and construction industry; entertainment industry
<br>
<br>(1) An employer to whom section 1383(b) 2 of this title (relating to the building and construction industry) applies is liable for a partial withdrawal only if the employer's obligation to contribute under the plan is continued for no more than an insubstantial portion of its work in the craft and area jurisdiction of the collective bargaining agreement of the type for which contributions are required.
<br>
<br>(2) An employer to whom section 1383(c) 2 of this title (relating to the entertainment industry) applies shall have no liability for a partial withdrawal except under the conditions and to the extent prescribed by the corporation by regulation.
<br>(e) Reduction or elimination of partial withdrawal liability under any conditions; criteria; procedures applicable
<br>
<br>(1) The corporation may prescribe regulations providing for the reduction or elimination of partial withdrawal liability under any conditions with respect to which the corporation determines that reduction or elimination of partial withdrawal liability is consistent with the purposes of this chapter.
<br>
<br>(2) Under such regulations, reduction of withdrawal liability shall be provided only with respect to subsequent changes in the employer's contributions for the same operations, or under the same collective bargaining agreement, that gave rise to the partial withdrawal, and changes in the employer's contribution base units with respect to other facilities or other collective bargaining agreements shall not be taken into account.
<br>
<br>(3) The corporation shall prescribe by regulation a procedure by which a plan may by amendment adopt rules for the reduction or elimination of partial withdrawal liability under any other conditions, subject to the approval of the corporation based on its determination that adoption of such rules by the plan is consistent with the purposes of this chapter.

<br>
<br>(1) ¾ of 1 percent of the plan's unfunded vested obligations (determined as of the end of the plan year ending before the date of withdrawal), or
<br>
<br>(2) $50,000,
<br>
<br>reduced by the amount, if any, by which the unfunded vested benefits allowable to the employer, determined without regard to this subsection, exceeds $100,000.
<br>(b) Amendment of plan for reduction of amount of unfunded vested benefits allocable to employer withdrawn from plan
<br>
<br>A plan may be amended to provide for the reduction of the amount determined under section 1391 of this title by not more than the greater of—

<br>(1) the amount determined under subsection (a), or
<br>
<br>(2) the lesser of—
<br>
<br>(A) the amount determined under subsection (a)(1), or
<br>
<br>(B) $100,000,
<br>
<br>reduced by the amount, if any, by which the amount determined under section 1391 of this title for the employer, determined without regard to this subsection, exceeds $150,000.
<br>(c) Nonapplicability
<br>
<br>This section does not apply—
<br>
<br>(1) to an employer who withdraws in a plan year in which substantially all employers withdraw from the plan, or
<br>
<br>(2) in any case in which substantially all employers withdraw from the plan during a period of one or more plan years pursuant to an agreement or arrangement to withdraw, to an employer who withdraws pursuant to such agreement or arrangement.
<br>(d) Presumption of employer withdrawal from plan pursuant to agreement or arrangement applicable in action or proceeding to determine or collect withdrawal liability
<br>
<br>In any action or proceeding to determine or collect withdrawal liability, if substantially all employers have withdrawn from a plan within a period of 3 plan years, an employer who has withdrawn from such plan during such period shall be presumed to have withdrawn from the plan pursuant to an agreement or arrangement, unless the employer proves otherwise by a preponderance of the evidence.

<br>§1390. Nonapplicability of withdrawal liability for certain temporary contribution obligation periods; exception
<br>
<br>(a) An employer who withdraws from a plan in complete or partial withdrawal is not liable to the plan if the employer—
<br>
<br>(1) first had an obligation to contribute to the plan after September 26, 1980,
<br>
<br>(2) had an obligation to contribute to the plan for no more than the lesser of—
<br>
<br>(A) 6 consecutive plan years preceding the date on which the employer withdraws, or
<br>
<br>(B) the number of years required for vesting under the plan,
<br>
<br>(3) was required to make contributions to the plan for each such plan year in an amount equal to less than 2 percent of the sum of all employer contributions made to the plan for each such year, and
<br>
<br>(4) has never avoided withdrawal liability because of the application of this section with respect to the plan.
<br>
<br>(b) Subsection (a) shall apply to an employer with respect to a plan only if—
<br>
<br>(1) the plan is amended to provide that subsection (a) applies;
<br>
<br>(2) the plan provides, or is amended to provide, that the reduction under section 411(a)(3)(E) of title 26 applies with respect to the employees of the employer; and
<br>
<br>(3) the ratio of the assets of the plan for the plan year preceding the first plan year for which the employer was required to contribute to the plan to the benefit payments made during that plan year was at least 8 to 1.

<br>2006—Subsec. (b)(1) to (4). Pub. L. 109–280 redesignated pars. (2) to (4) as (1) to (3), respectively, and struck out former par. (1) which read as follows: "the plan is not a plan which primarily covers employees in the building and construction industry;".
<br>
<br>1989—Subsec. (b)(3). Pub. L. 101–239 substituted "Internal Revenue Code of 1986" for "Internal Revenue Code of 1954", which for purposes of codification was translated as "title 26" thus requiring no change in text.
