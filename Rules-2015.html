<br>(d) Power of attorney requirement in contracts; exercise of power by Secretary
<br>
<br>Any recordable contract covering excess lands sales shall provide that a power of attorney shall vest in the Secretary to sell any excess lands not disposed of by the owners thereof within the period of time specified in the recordable contract. In the exercise of that power, the Secretary shall sell such lands through an impartial selection process only to qualified purchasers according to such reasonable rules and regulations as the Secretary may establish: Provided, That the Secretary shall recover for the owner the fair market value of the land unrelated to irrigation water deliveries plus the fair market value of improvements thereon.
<br>(e) Extension of time for disposal of excess lands
<br>
<br>In the event that the owner of any lands in excess of the ownership limitations of Federal reclamation law has heretofore entered into a recordable contract with the Secretary for the disposition of such excess lands and has been prevented from disposing of them because the Secretary may have withheld the processing or approval of the disposition of the lands (whether he may have been compelled to do so by court order or for other reasons), the period of time for the disposal of such lands by the owner thereof pursuant to the contract shall be extended from the date on which the Secretary again commences the processing or the approval of the disposition of such lands for a period which shall be equal to the remaining period of time under the recordable contract for the disposal thereof by the owner at the time the decision of the Secretary to withhold the processing or approval of such disposition first became effective.
<br>(f) Eligibility of excess lands for irrigation water after disposition
<br>
<br>Excess lands which have been or may be disposed of in compliance with Federal reclamation law, including this subchapter, shall not be considered eligible to receive irrigation water unless—
<br>
<br>(1) they are held by nonexcess owners; and
<br>
<br>(2) in the case of disposals made after October 12, 1982, their title is burdened by a covenant prohibiting their sale, for a period of ten years after their original disposal to comply with Federal reclamation law, including this subchapter, for values exceeding the sum of the value of newly added improvements and the value of the land as increased by market appreciation unrelated to the delivery of irrigation water. Upon expiration of the terms of such covenant, the title to such lands shall be freed of the burden of any limitations on subsequent sale values which might otherwise be imposed by the operation of section 423e of this title.
