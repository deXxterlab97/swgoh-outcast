<br>
<br>        
<br>§9201. Findings
<br>
<br>Congress finds the following:
<br>
<br>(1) Gaps currently exist on the underlying research needed to develop tools that detect videos, audio files, or photos that have manipulated or synthesized content, including those generated by generative adversarial networks. Research on digital forensics is also needed to identify, preserve, recover, and analyze the provenance of digital artifacts.
<br>
<br>(2) The National Science Foundation's focus to support research in artificial intelligence through computer and information science and engineering, cognitive science and psychology, economics and game theory, control theory, linguistics, mathematics, and philosophy, is building a better understanding of how new technologies are shaping the society and economy of the United States.
<br>
<br>(3) The National Science Foundation has identified the "10 Big Ideas for NSF Future Investment" including "Harnessing the Data Revolution" and the "Future of Work at the Human-Technology Frontier", with artificial intelligence is a critical component.
<br>
<br>(4) The outputs generated by generative adversarial networks should be included under the umbrella of research described in paragraph (3) given the grave national security and societal impact potential of such networks.
<br>
<br>(5) Generative adversarial networks are not likely to be utilized as the sole technique of artificial intelligence or machine learning capable of creating credible deepfakes. Other techniques may be developed in the future to produce similar outputs.

<br>§9202. NSF support of research on manipulated or synthesized content and information security
<br>
<br>The Director of the National Science Foundation, in consultation with other relevant Federal agencies, shall support merit-reviewed and competitively awarded research on manipulated or synthesized content and information authenticity, which may include—
<br>
<br>(1) fundamental research on digital forensic tools or other technologies for verifying the authenticity of information and detection of manipulated or synthesized content, including content generated by generative adversarial networks;
<br>
<br>(2) fundamental research on technical tools for identifying manipulated or synthesized content, such as watermarking systems for generated media;
<br>
<br>(3) social and behavioral research related to manipulated or synthesized content, including human engagement with the content;
<br>
<br>(4) research on public understanding and awareness of manipulated and synthesized content, including research on best practices for educating the public to discern authenticity of digital content; and
<br>
<br>(5) research awards coordinated with other federal agencies and programs, including the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Agency,1 with coordination enabled by the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Program.

<br>(b) Outreach
<br>
<br>The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology shall conduct outreach—
<br>
<br>(1) to receive input from private, public, and academic stakeholders on fundamental measurements and standards research necessary to examine the function and outputs of generative adversarial networks; and
<br>
<br>(2) to consider the feasibility of an ongoing public and private sector engagement to develop voluntary standards for the function and outputs of generative adversarial networks or other technologies that synthesize or manipulate content.
