<br>12Yet God is my King of old,
<br> 
<br>Working salvation in the midst of the earth.
<br>13Thou didst break the sea in pieces by Thy strength;
<br>Thou didst shatter the heads of the sea-monsters in the waters.
<br>14Thou didst crush the heads of leviathan,
<br>Thou gavest him to be food to the folk inhabiting the wilderness.
<br>15Thou didst cleave fountain and brook;
<br>Thou driedst up ever-flowing rivers.
<br>16Thine is the day, Thine also the night;
<br>Thou hast established luminary and sun.
<br>17Thou hast set all the borders of the earth;
<br>Thou hast made summer and winter.
<br>
<br>18Remember this, how the enemy hath reproached the LORD,
<br>And how a base people have blasphemed Thy name.
<br>19O deliver not the soul of Thy turtle-dove unto the wild beast;
<br>Forget not the life of Thy poor for ever.
<br>20Look upon the covenant;
<br>For the dark places of the land are full of the habitations of violence.
<br>21O let not the oppressed turn back in confusion;
<br>Let the poor and needy praise Thy name.
<br>22Arise, O God, plead Thine own cause;
<br> 
<br>Remember Thy reproach all the day at the hand of the base man.
<br>23Forget not the voice of Thine adversaries,
<br>The tumult of those that rise up against Thee which ascendeth continually.
<br>
<br>For the Leader; Al-tashheth. A Psalm of Asaph, a Song.
<br>
<br>2We give thanks unto Thee, O God,
<br>We give thanks, and Thy name is near;
<br>Men tell of Thy wondrous works. 3'When I take the appointed time, I Myself will judge with equity. 4When the earth and all the
<br>inhabitants thereof are dissolved, I Myself establish the pillars of it.'
<br>Selah
<br>
<br>5I say unto the arrogant 'Deal not arrogantly';
<br>And to the wicked 'Lift not up the horn.'
<br>6Lift not up your horn on high;
<br>Speak not insolence with a haughty neck.
<br>7For neither from the east, nor from the west,
<br>Nor yet from the wilderness, cometh lifting up.
<br>8For God is judge;
<br>He putteth down one, and lifteth up another.
<br>9For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, with foaming wine, full of mixture,
<br> 
<br>And He poureth out of the same;
<br>Surely the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall drain them, and drink them.
<br>
<br>10But as for me, I will declare for ever,
<br>I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
<br>11All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off;
<br>But the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.
<br> 
<br>And who may stand in Thy sight when once Thou art angry?
<br>9Thou didst cause sentence to be heard from heaven;
<br>The earth feared, and was still,
<br>10When God arose to judgment,
<br>To save all the humble of the earth.
<br>Selah
<br>
<br>11Surely the wrath of man shall praise Thee;
<br>The residue of wrath shalt Thou gird upon Thee.
<br>12Vow, and pay unto the LORD your
<br> 
<br>76
<br>Song.
<br> 
<br>For the Leader; with string- music. A Psalm of Asaph, a
<br> 
<br>God;
<br>Let all that are round about Him bring presents unto Him that is to be feared;
<br> 
<br>2In Judah is God known; His name is great in Israel.
<br>3In Salem also is set His tabernacle, And His dwelling-place in Zion.
<br>4There He broke the fiery shafts of the bow;
<br>The shield, and the sword, and the battle.	Selah
<br>
<br>5Glorious art Thou and excellent, coming down from the mountains of prey.
<br>6The stout-hearted are bereft of sense, they sleep their sleep;
<br>And none of the men of might have found their hands.
<br>7At Thy rebuke, O God of Jacob,
<br>They are cast into a dead sleep, the riders also and the horses.
<br>
<br>8Thou, even Thou, art terrible;
<br> 
<br>13He minisheth the spirit of princes;
<br>He is terrible to the kings of the earth.
<br>
<br>For the Leader; for Jeduthun. A Psalm of Asaph.
<br>
<br>2I will lift up my voice unto God, an cry;
<br>I will lift up my voice unto God, that He may give ear unto me.
<br>3In the day of my trouble I seek the Lord;
<br>With my hand uplifted, [mine eye] streameth in the night without ceasing;
<br>My soul refuseth to be comforted.
<br>4When I think thereon, O God, I must moan;
<br>When I muse thereon, my spirit fainteth.	Selah
<br> 
<br>5Thou holdest fast the lids of mine eyes;
<br>I am troubled, and cannot speak.
<br>6I have pondered the days of old, the years of ancient times.
<br>7In the night I will call to remembrance my song;
<br>I will commune with mine own heart;
<br>And my spirit maketh diligent search
<br>8'Will the Lord cast off for ever? And will He be favourable no more? 9Is His mercy clean gone for ever?
<br>Is His promise come to an end for evermore?
<br>10Hath God forgotten to be gracious?
<br>Hath He in anger shut up his compassions?'	Selah
<br>11And I say 'This is my weakness, That the right hand of the Most
<br>High could change.
<br>12I will make mention of the deeds of the LORD;
<br>Yea, I will remember Thy wonders of old.
<br>13I will meditate also upon all Thy work,
<br>And muse on Thy doings.'
<br>14O God, Thy way is in holiness; Who is a great god like unto God? 15Thou art the God that doest
<br>wonders;
<br>Thou hast made known Thy strength among the peoples.
<br>16Thou hast with Thine arm redeemed Thy people,
<br>The sons of Jacob and Joseph.
<br> 
<br>Selah
<br>17The waters saw Thee, O God;
<br>The waters saw Thee, they were in pain;
<br>The depths also trembled.
<br>18The clouds flooded forth waters; The skies sent out a sound;
<br>Thine arrows also went abroad.
<br>19The voice of Thy thunder was in the whirlwind;
<br>The lightnings lighted up the world; The earth trembled and shook.
<br>20Thy way was in the sea,
<br>And Thy path in the great waters, And Thy footsteps were not known. 21Thou didst lead Thy people like a
<br>flock,
<br>By the hand of Moses and Aaron.
<br>78 Maschil of Asaph.
<br>Give ear, O my people, to my
<br>teaching;
<br>Incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
<br>2I will open my mouth with a parable;
<br>I will utter dark sayings concerning days of old;
<br>3That which we have heard and known,
<br>And our fathers have told us,
<br>4We will not hide from their children,
<br>Telling to the generation to come the praises of the LORD,
<br>And His strength, and His wondrous works that He hath done.
<br> 
<br>5For He established a testimony in Jacob,
<br>And appointed a law in Israel, Which He commanded our fathers,
<br>That they should make them known to their children;
<br>6That the generation to come might know them, even the children that should be born;
<br>Who should arise and tell them to their children,
<br>7That they might put their confidence in God,
<br>And not forget the works of God, But keep His commandments; 8And might not be as their fathers,
<br>A stubborn and rebellious generation;
<br>A generation that set not their heart aright,
<br>And whose spirit was not stedfast with God.
<br>
<br>9The children of Ephraim were as archers handling the bow,
<br>That turned back in the day of battle.
<br>10They kept not the covenant of God,
<br>And refused to walk in His law;
<br>11And they forgot His doings,
<br>And His wondrous works that He had shown them.
<br>12Marvellous things did He in the sight of their fathers,
<br>In the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.
<br>13He cleaved the sea, and caused them to pass through;
<br> 
<br>And He made the waters to stand as a heap.
<br>14By day also He led them with a cloud,
<br>And all the night with a light of fire.
<br>15He cleaved rocks in the wilderness,
<br>And gave them drink abundantly as out of the great deep.
<br>16He brought streams also out of the rock,
<br>And caused waters to run down like rivers.
<br>
<br>17Yet went they on still to sin against Him,
<br>To rebel against the Most High in the desert.
<br>18And they tried God in their heart By asking food for their craving. 19Yea, they spoke against God;
<br>They said 'Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?
<br>20Behold, He smote the rock, that waters gushed out,
<br>And streams overflowed; Can He give bread also?
<br>Or will He provide flesh for His people?'
<br>21Therefore the LORD heard, and was wroth;
<br>And a fire was kindled against Jacob,
<br>And anger also went up against Israel;
<br>22Because they believed not in God, And trusted not in His salvation.
<br>23And He commanded the skies above,
<br> 
<br>And opened the doors of heaven;
<br>24And He caused manna to rain upon them for food,
<br>And gave them of the corn of heaven.
<br>25Man did eat the bread of the mighty;
<br>He sent them provisions to the full.
<br>26He caused the east wind to set forth in heaven;
<br>And by His power He brought on the south wind.
<br>27He caused flesh also to rain upon them as the dust,
<br>And winged fowl as the sand of the seas;
<br>28And He let it fall in the midst of their camp,
<br>Round about their dwellings.
<br>29So they did eat, and were well filled;
<br>And He gave them that which they craved.
<br>30They were not estranged from their craving,
<br>Their food was yet in their mouths,
<br>31When the anger of God went up against them,
<br>And slew of the lustieth among them,
<br>And smote down the young men of Israel.
<br>
<br>32For all this they sinned still,
<br>And believed not in His wondrous works.
<br>33Therefore He ended their days as a breath,
<br>And their years in terror.
<br> 
<br>34When He slew them, then they would inquire after Him,
<br>And turn back and seek God earnestly.
<br>35And they remembered that God was their Rock,
<br>And the Most High God their redeemer.
<br>36But they beguiled Him with their mouth,
<br>And lied unto Him with their tongue.
<br>37For their heart was not stedfast with Him,
<br>Neither were they faithful in His covenant.
<br>38But He, being full of compassion, forgiveth iniquity, and destroyeth not;
<br>Yea, many a time doth He turn His anger away,
<br>And doth not stir up all His wrath.
<br>39So He remembered that they were but flesh,
<br>A wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.
<br>
<br>40How oft did they rebel against Him in the wilderness,
<br>And grieve Him in the desert! 41And still again they tried God, And set bounds to the Holy One of
<br>Israel.
<br>42They remembered not His hand,
<br>Nor the day when He redeemed them from the adversary.
<br>43How He set His signs in Egypt, And His wonders in the field of
<br>Zoan;
<br> 
<br>44And turned their rivers into blood,
<br>So that they could not drink their streams.
<br>45He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them;
<br>And frogs, which destroyed them.
<br>46He gave also their increase unto the caterpillar,
<br>And their labour unto the locust. 47He destroyed their vines with hail, And their sycamore-trees with frost. 48He gave over their cattle also to
<br>the hail,
<br>And their flocks to fiery bolts.
<br>49He sent forth upon them the fierceness of His anger,
<br>Wrath, and indignation, and trouble, A sending of messengers of evil.
<br>50He levelled a path for His anger; He spared not their soul from death,
<br>But gave their life over to the pestilence;
<br>51And smote all the first-born in Egypt,
<br>The first-fruits of their strength in the tents of Ham;
<br>52But He made His own people to go forth like sheep,
<br>And guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
<br>53And He led them safely, and they feared not;
<br>But the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
<br>54And He brought them to His holy border,
<br>To the mountain, which His right hand had gotten.
<br> 
<br>55He drove out the nations also before them,
<br>And allotted them for an inheritance by line,
<br>And made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
<br>
<br>56Yet they tried and provoked God, the Most High,
<br>And kept not His testimonies;
<br>57But turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers;
<br>They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
<br>58For they provoked Him with their high places,
<br>And moved Him to jealousy with their graven images.
<br>59God heard, and was wroth, And He greatly abhorred Israel;
<br>60And He forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh,
<br>The tent which He had made to dwell among men;
<br>61And delivered His strength into captivity,
<br>And His glory into the adversary's hand.
<br>62He gave His people over also unto the sword;
<br>And was wroth with His inheritance. 63Fire devoured their young men; And their virgins had no marriage-
<br>song.
<br>64Their priests fell by the sword;
<br>And their widows made no lamentation.
<br> 
<br>65Then the Lord awaked as one asleep,
<br>Like a mighty man recovering from wine.
<br>66And He smote His adversaries backward;
<br>He put upon them a perpetual reproach.
<br>67Moreover He abhorred the tent of Joseph,
<br>And chose not the tribe of Ephraim;
<br>68But chose the tribe of Judah, The mount Zion which He loved. 69And He built His sanctuary like
<br>the heights,
<br>Like the earth which He hath founded for ever.
<br>70He chose David also His servant, And took him from the sheepfolds; 71From following the ewes that give
<br>suck He brought him,
<br>To be shepherd over Jacob His people, and Israel His inheritance.
<br>72So he shepherded them according to the integrity of his heart;
<br>And lead them by the skilfulness of his hands.
<br>79 A Psalm of Asaph.
<br>O God, the heathen are come into
<br>Thine inheritance;
<br>They have defiled Thy holy temple;
<br>They have made Jerusalem into heaps.
<br>2They have given the dead bodies of Thy servants to be food unto the fowls of the heaven,
<br> 
<br>The flesh of Thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.
<br>3They have shed their blood like water
<br>Round about Jerusalem, with none to bury them.
<br>4We are become a taunt to our neighbours,
<br>A scorn and derision to them that are round about us.
<br>
<br>5How long, O LORD, wilt Thou be angry for ever?
<br>How long will Thy jealousy burn like fire?
<br>6Pour out Thy wrath upon the nations that know Thee not,
<br>And upon the kingdoms that call not upon Thy name.
<br>7For they have devoured Jacob, And laid waste his habitation. 8Remember not against us the
<br>iniquities of our forefathers;
<br>Let Thy compassions speedily come to meet us;
<br>For we are brought very low.
<br>
<br>9Help us, O God of our salvation, for the sake of the glory of Thy name;
<br>And deliver us, and forgive our sins, for Thy name's sake.
<br>10Wherefore should the nations say: 'Where is their God?'
<br>Let the avenging of Thy servants' blood that is shed
<br>Be made known among the nations in our sight.
<br> 
<br>11Let the groaning of the prisoner come before Thee;
<br>According to the greatness of Thy power set free those that are appointed to death;
<br>12And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom
<br>Their reproach, wherewith they have reproached Thee, O Lord.
<br>13So we that are Thy people and the flock of Thy pasture
<br>Will give Thee thanks for ever;
<br>We will tell of Thy praise to all generations.
<br>
<br>For the Leader; upon Shoshannim. A testimony. A
<br>Psalm of Asaph.
<br>
<br>2Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel,
<br>Thou that leadest Joseph like a flock;
<br>Thou that art enthroned upon the cherubim, shine forth.
<br>3Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up Thy might,
<br>And come to save us.
<br>4O God, restore us;
<br>And cause Thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.
<br>
<br>5O LORD God of hosts,
<br>How long wilt Thou be angry against the prayer of Thy people?
<br>6Thou hast fed them with the bread of tears,
<br>And given them tears to drink in large measure.
<br> 
<br>7Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours;
<br>And our enemies mock as they please.
<br>8O God of hosts, restore us;
<br>And cause Thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.
<br>
<br>9Thou didst pluck up a vine out of Egypt;
<br>Thou didst drive out the nations, and didst plant it.
<br>10Thou didst clear a place before it,
<br>And it took deep root, and filled the land.
<br>11The mountains were covered with the shadow of it,
<br>And the mighty cedars with the boughs thereof.
<br>12She sent out her branches unto the sea,
<br>And her shoots unto the River.
<br>13Why hast Thou broken down her fences,
<br>So that all they that pass by the way do pluck her?
<br>14The boar out of the wood doth ravage it,
<br>That which moveth in the field feedeth on it.
<br>15O God of hosts, return, we beseech Thee;
<br>Look from heaven, and behold, and be mindful of this vine,
<br>16And of the stock which Thy right hand hath planted,
<br>And the branch that Thou madest strong for Thyself.
<br> 
<br>17It is burned with fire, it is cut down;
<br>They perish at the rebuke of Thy countenance.
<br>18Let Thy hand be upon the man of Thy right hand,
<br>Upon the son of man whom Thou madest strong for Thyself.
<br>19So shall we not turn back from Thee;
<br>Quicken Thou us, and we will call upon Thy name.
<br>20O LORD God of hosts, restore us;
<br>Cause Thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.
<br>
<br>For the Leader; upon the Gittith. [A Psalm] of Asaph.
<br>
<br>2Sing aloud unto God our strength; Shout unto the God of Jacob.
<br>3Take up the melody, and sound the timbrel,
<br>The sweet harp with the psaltery. 4Blow the horn at the new moon, At the full moon for our feast-day. 5For it is a statute for Israel,
<br>An ordinance of the God of Jacob.
<br>6He appointed it in Joseph for a testimony,
<br>When He went forth against the land of Egypt.
<br>The speech of one that I knew not did I hear:
<br>
<br>7'I removed his shoulder from the burden; His hands were freed from the basket.
<br> 
<br>8Thou didst call in trouble, and I rescued thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder; I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah
<br>9Hear, O My people, and I will admonish thee: O Israel, if thou wouldest hearken unto Me!
<br>10There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any foreign god.
<br>11I am the LORD thy God, who brought thee up out of the land of Egypt; open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.
<br>
<br>12But My people hearkened not to My voice;
<br>And Israel would none of Me.
<br>13So I let them go after the stubbornness of their heart,
<br>That they might walk in their own counsels.
<br>14Oh that My people would hearken unto Me,
<br>That Israel would walk in My ways!
<br>15I would soon subdue their enemies,
<br>And turn My hand against their adversaries.
<br>16The haters of the LORD should dwindle away before Him;
<br>And their punishment should endure for ever.
<br>17They should also be fed with the fat of wheat;
<br>And with honey out of the rock would I satisfy thee.'
<br> 
<br>82	A Psalm of Asaph.
<br>God standeth in the congregation of
<br>God;
<br>In the midst of the judges He judgeth:
<br>2'How long will ye judge unjustly,
<br>And respect the persons of the wicked?	Selah
<br>3Judge the poor and fatherless;
<br>Do justice to the afflicted and destitute.
<br>4Rescue the poor and needy;
<br>Deliver them out of the hand of the wicked.
<br>5They know not, neither do they understand;
<br>They go about in darkness;
<br>All the foundations of the earth are moved.
<br>6I said: Ye are godlike beings, And all of you sons of the Most
<br>High.
<br>7Nevertheless ye shall die like men, And fall like one of the princes.'
<br>
<br>8Arise, O God, judge the earth;
<br>For Thou shalt possess all the nations.
<br>83	A Song, a Psalm of Asaph.
<br>2O God, keep not Thou silence;
<br>Hold not Thy peace, and be not still, O God.
<br>3For, lo, Thine enemies are in an uproar;
<br>And they that hate Thee have lifted up the head.
<br> 
<br>4They hold crafty converse against Thy people,
<br>And take counsel against Thy treasured ones.
<br>5They have said: 'Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation;
<br>That the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.'
<br>6For they have consulted together with one consent;
<br>Against Thee do they make a covenant;
<br>7The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites;
<br>Moab, and the Hagrites;
<br>8Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia with the inhabitants of
<br>Tyre;
<br>9Assyria also is joined with them;
<br>They have been an arm to the children of Lot.	Selah
<br>
<br>10Do Thou unto them as unto Midian;
<br>As to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook Kishon;
<br>11Who were destroyed at En-dor; They became as dung for the earth. 12Make their nobles like Oreb and
<br>Zeeb,
<br>And like Zebah and Zalmunna all their princes;
<br>13Who said: 'Let us take to ourselves in possession
<br>The habitations of God.'
<br>14O my God, make them like the whirling dust;
<br>As stubble before the wind.
<br>15As the fire that burneth the forest,
<br> 
<br>And as the flame that setteth the mountains ablaze;
<br>16So pursue them with Thy tempest, And affright them with Thy storm. 17Fill their faces with shame;
<br>That they may seek Thy name, O LORD.
<br>18Let them be ashamed and affrighted for ever;
<br>Yea, let them be abashed and perish; 19That they may know that it is Thou alone whose name is the LORD,
<br>The Most High over all the earth.
<br> 
<br>Yea, the early rain clotheth it with blessings.
<br>8They go from strength to strength, Every one of them appeareth before
<br>God in Zion.
<br>
<br>9O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer;
<br>Give ear, O God of Jacob.	Selah
<br>10Behold, O God our shield,
<br>And look upon the face of Thine anointed.
<br>11For a day in Thy courts is better than a thousand;
<br> 
<br>84
<br>Korah.
<br> 
<br>For the Leader; upon the Gittith. A Psalm of the sons of
<br> 
<br>I had rather stand at the threshold of the house of my God,
<br>Than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.
<br> 
<br>2How lovely are Thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts!
<br>3My soul yearneth, yea, even pineth for the courts of the LORD;
<br>My heart and my flesh sing for joy unto the living God.
<br>4Yea, the sparrow hath found a house, and the swallow a nest for herself,
<br>Where she may lay her young; Thine altars, O LORD of hosts, My King, and my God—
<br>5Happy are they that dwell in Thy house,
<br>They are ever praising Thee.	Selah
<br>
<br>6Happy is the man whose strength is in Thee;
<br>In whose heart are the highways.
<br>7Passing through the valley of Baca they make it a place of springs;
<br> 
<br>12For the LORD God is a sun and a shield;
<br>The LORD giveth grace and glory;
<br>No good thing will He withhold from them that walk uprightly.
<br>13O LORD of hosts,
<br>Happy is the man that trusteth in Thee.
<br>
<br>For the Leader. A Psalm of the sons of Korah.
<br>
<br>2LORD, Thou hast been favourable unto Thy land,
<br>Thou hast turned the captivity of Jacob.
<br>3Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of Thy people,
<br>Thou hast pardoned all their sin.
<br>Selah
<br> 
<br>4Thou hast withdrawn all Thy wrath;
<br>Thou hast turned from the fierceness of Thine anger.
<br>5Restore us, O God of our salvation,
<br>And cause Thine indignation toward us to cease.
<br>6Wilt Thou be angry with us for ever?
<br>Wilt Thou draw out Thine anger to all generations?
<br>7Wilt Thou not quicken us again, That Thy people may rejoice in
<br>Thee?
<br>8Show us Thy mercy, O LORD, And grant us Thy salvation.
<br>
<br>9I will hear what God the LORD will speak;
<br>For He will speak peace unto His people, and to His saints;
<br>But let them not turn back to folly.
<br>10Surely His salvation is nigh them that fear Him;
<br>That glory may dwell in our land.
<br>11Mercy and truth are met together;
<br>Righteousness and peace have kissed each other.
<br>12Truth springeth out of the earth;
<br>And righteousness hath looked down from heaven.
<br>13Yea, the LORD will give that which is good;
<br>And our land shall yield her produce.
<br>14Righteousness shall go before Him,
<br>And shall make His footsteps a way.
<br> 
<br>86 A Prayer of David.
<br>Incline Thine ear, O LORD, and
<br>answer me;
<br>For I am poor and needy.
<br>2Keep my soul, for I am godly;
<br>O Thou my God, save Thy servant that trusteth in Thee.
<br>3Be gracious unto me, O Lord; For unto Thee do I cry all the day. 4Rejoice the soul of Thy servant;
<br>For unto Thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
<br>5For Thou, Lord, art good, and ready to pardon,
<br>And plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon Thee.
<br>
<br>6Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer;
<br>And attend unto the voice of my supplications.
<br>7In the day of my trouble I call upon Thee;
<br>For Thou wilt answer me.
<br>8There is none like unto Thee among the gods, O Lord,
<br>And there are no works like Thine.
<br>9All nations whom Thou hast made shall come and prostrate themselves before Thee, O Lord;
<br>And they shall glorify Thy name.
<br>10For Thou art great, and doest wondrous things;
<br>Thou art God alone.
<br>
<br>11Teach me, O LORD, Thy way, that I may walk in Thy truth;
<br>Make one my heart to fear Thy name.
<br> 
<br>12I will thank Thee, O Lord my God, with my whole heart;
<br>And I will glorify Thy name for evermore.
<br>13For great is Thy mercy toward me;
<br>And Thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest nether-world.
<br>
<br>14O God, the proud are risen up against me,
<br>And the company of violent men have sought after my soul,
<br>And have not set Thee before them.
<br>15But Thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion and gracious,
<br>Slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy and truth.
<br>16O turn unto me, and be gracious unto me;
<br>Give Thy strength unto Thy servant, And save the son of Thy handmaid. 17Work in my behalf a sign for
<br>good;
<br>That they that hate me may see it, and be put to shame,
<br>Because Thou, LORD, hast helped me, and comforted me.
<br>
<br>A Psalm of the sons of Korah; a Song.
<br>
<br>His foundation is in the holy mountains.
<br>2The LORD loveth the gates of Zion More than all the dwellings of
<br>Jacob.
<br>3Glorious things are spoken of Thee, O city of God.	Selah
<br> 
<br>4'I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon as among them that know Me;
<br>Behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia;
<br>This one was born there.'
<br>5But of Zion it shall be said: 'This man and that was born in her;
<br>And the Most High Himself doth establish her.'
<br>6The LORD shall count in the register of the peoples:
<br>'This one was born there.'	Selah 7And whether they sing or dance, All my thoughts are in Thee.
<br>
<br>A Song, a Psalm of the sons of Korah; for the Leader; upon
<br>Mahalath Leannoth. Maschil of Heman the Ezrahite.
<br>
<br>2O LORD, God of my salvation, What time I cry in the night before
<br>Thee,
<br>3Let my prayer come before Thee, Incline Thine ear unto my cry.
<br>
<br>4For my soul is sated with troubles,
<br>And my life draweth nigh unto the grave.
<br>5I am counted with them that go down into the pit;
<br>I am become as a man that hath no help;
<br>6Set apart among the dead,
<br>Like the slain that lie in the grave, Whom Thou rememberest no more; And they are cut off from Thy hand.
<br> 
<br>7Thou hast laid me in the nether- most pit,
<br>In dark places, in the deeps.
<br>8Thy wrath lieth hard upon me,
<br>And all Thy waves Thou pressest down.	Selah
<br>9Thou hast put mine acquaintance far from me;
<br>Thou hast made me an abomination unto them;
<br>I am shut up, and I cannot come forth.
<br>
<br>10Mine eye languisheth by reason of affliction;
<br>I have called upon Thee, O LORD, every day,
<br>I have spread forth my hands unto Thee.
<br>11Wilt Thou work wonders for the dead?
<br>Or shall the shades arise and give Thee thanks?	Selah
<br>12Shall Thy mercy be declared in the grave?
<br>Or Thy faithfulness in destruction?
<br>13Shall Thy wonders be known in the dark?
<br>And Thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?
<br>
<br>14But as for me, unto Thee, O LORD, do I cry,
<br>And in the morning doth my prayer come to meet Thee.
<br>15LORD, why castest Thou off my soul?
<br>Why hidest Thou Thy face from me?
<br> 
<br>16I am afflicted and at the point of death from my youth up;
<br>I have borne Thy terrors, I am distracted.
<br>17Thy fierce wrath is gone over me; Thy terrors have cut me off.
<br>18They came round about me like water all the day;
<br>They compassed me about together.
<br>19Friend and companion hast Thou put far from me,
<br>And mine acquaintance into darkness.
<br>89 Maschil of Ethan the Ezrahite.
<br>2I will sing of the mercies of the
<br>LORD for ever;
<br>To all generations will I make known Thy faithfulness with my mouth.
<br>3For I have said: 'For ever is mercy built;
<br>In the very heavens Thou dost establish Thy faithfulness.
<br>4I have made a covenant with My chosen,
<br>I have sworn unto David My servant:
<br>5For ever will I establish thy seed,
<br>And build up thy throne to all generations.'	Selah
<br>
<br>6So shall the heavens praise Thy wonders, O LORD,
<br>Thy faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones.
<br>7For who in the skies can be compared unto the LORD,
<br> 
<br>Who among the sons of might can be likened unto the LORD,
<br>8A God dreaded in the great council of the holy ones,
<br>And feared of all them that are about Him?
<br>9O LORD God of hosts,
<br>Who is a mighty one, like unto Thee, O LORD?
<br>And Thy faithfulness is round about Thee.
<br>10Thou rulest the proud swelling of the sea;
<br>When the waves thereof arise, Thou stillest them.
<br>11Thou didst crush Rahab, as one that is slain;
<br>Thou didst scattered Thine enemies with the arm of Thy strength.
<br>12Thine are the heavens, Thine also the earth;
<br>The world and the fulness thereof, Thou hast founded them.
<br>13The north and the south, Thou hast created them;
<br>Tabor and Hermon rejoice in Thy name.
<br>14Thine is an arm with might; Strong is Thy hand, and exalted is
<br>Thy right hand.
<br>15Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Thy throne;
<br>Mercy and truth go before Thee.
<br>16Happy is the people that know the joyful shout;
<br>They walk, O LORD, in the light of Thy countenance.
<br>17In Thy name do they rejoice all the day;
<br> 
<br>And through Thy righteousness are they exalted.
<br>18For Thou art the glory of their strength;
<br>And in Thy favour our horn is exalted.
<br>19For of the LORD is our shield;
<br>And the Holy One of Israel is our king.
<br>
<br>20Then Thou spokest in vision to Thy godly ones,
<br>And saidst: 'I have laid help upon one that is mighty;
<br>I have exalted one chosen out of the people.
<br>21I have found David My servant;
<br>With My holy oil have I anointed him;
<br>22With whom My hand shall be established;
<br>Mine arm also shall strengthen him.
<br>23The enemy shall not exact from him;
<br>Nor the son of wickedness afflict him.
<br>24And I will beat to pieces his adversaries before him,
<br>And smite them that hate him.
<br>25But My faithfulness and My mercy shall be with him;
<br>And through My name shall his horn be exalted.
<br>26I will set his hand also on the sea, And his right hand on the rivers.
<br>27He shall call unto Me: Thou art my Father,
<br>My God, and the rock of my salvation.
<br> 
<br>28I also will appoint him first-born, The highest of the kings of the earth. 29For ever will I keep for him My
<br>mercy,
<br>And My covenant shall stand fast with him.
<br>30His seed also will I make to endure for ever,
<br>And his throne as the days of heaven.
<br>31If his children forsake My law, And walk not in Mine ordinances;
<br>:32If they profane My statutes,
<br>And keep not My commandments;
<br>33Then will I visit their transgression with the rod,
<br>And their iniquity with strokes.
<br>34But My mercy will I not break off from him,
<br>Nor will I be false to My faithfulness.
<br>35My covenant will I not profane, Nor alter that which is gone out of
<br>My lips.
<br>36Once have I sworn by My holiness:
<br>Surely I will not be false unto David;
<br>37His seed shall endure for ever, And his throne as the sun before
<br>Me.
<br>38It shall be established for ever as the moon;
<br>And be stedfast as the witness in sky.'	Selah
<br>
<br>39But Thou hast cast off and rejected,
<br> 
<br>Thou hast been wroth with Thine anointed.
<br>40Thou hast abhorred the covenant of Thy servant;
<br>Thou hast profaned his crown even to the ground.
<br>41Thou hast broken down all his fences;
<br>Thou hast brought his strongholds to ruin.
<br>42All that pass by the way spoil him;
<br>He is become a taunt to his neighbours.
<br>43Thou hast exalted the right hand of his adversaries;
<br>Thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.
<br>44Yea, Thou turnest back the edge of his sword,
<br>And hast not made him to stand in the battle.
<br>45Thou hast made his brightness to cease,
<br>And cast his throne down to the ground.
<br>46The days of his youth hast Thou shortened;
<br>Thou hast covered him with shame.
<br>Selah
<br>47How long, O LORD, wilt Thou hide Thyself for ever?
<br>How long shall Thy wrath burn like fire?
<br>48O remember how short my time is;
<br>For what vanity hast Thou created all the children of men!
<br>49What man is he that liveth and shall not see death,
<br> 
<br>That shall deliver his soul from the power of the grave?	Selah
<br>50Where are Thy former mercies, O Lord,
<br>Which Thou didst swear unto David in Thy faithfulness?
<br>51Remember, Lord, the taunt of Thy servants;
<br>How I do bear in my bosom [the taunt of] so many peoples; 52Wherewith Thine enemies have
<br>taunted, O LORD,
<br>Wherewith they have taunted the footsteps of Thine anointed.
<br>53Blessed be the LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen.

<br>BOOK IV
<br>A Prayer of Moses the man of God.
<br>
<br>Lord, Thou hast been our dwelling- place in all generations.
<br>2Before the mountains were brought forth,
<br>Or ever Thou hadst formed the earth and the world,
<br>Even from everlasting to everlasting, Thou art God.
<br>3Thou turnest man to contrition;
<br>And sayest: 'Return, ye children of men.'
<br>4For a thousand years in Thy sight Are but as yesterday when it is past, And as a watch in the night.
<br> 
<br>5Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep;
<br>In the morning they are like grass which groweth up.
<br>6In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up;
<br>In the evening it is cut down, and withereth.
<br>
<br>7For we are consumed in Thine anger,
<br>And by Thy wrath are we hurried away.
<br>8Thou hast set our iniquities before Thee,
<br>Our secret sins in the light of Thy countenance.
<br>9For all our days are passed away in Thy wrath;
<br>We bring our years to an end as a tale that is told.
<br>10The days of our years are threescore years and ten,
<br>Or even by reason of strength fourscore years;
<br>Yet is their pride but travail and vanity;
<br>For it is speedily gone, and we fly away.
<br>11Who knoweth the power of Thine anger,
<br>And Thy wrath according to the fear that is due unto Thee?
<br>12So teach us to number our days,
<br>That we may get us a heart of wisdom.
<br>
<br>13Return, O LORD; how long?
<br> 
<br>And let it repent Thee concerning Thy servants.
<br>14O satisfy us in the morning with Thy mercy;
<br>That we may rejoice and be glad all our days.
<br>15Make us glad according to the days wherein Thou hast afflicted us,
<br>According to the years wherein we have seen evil.
<br>16Let Thy work appear unto Thy servants,
<br>And Thy glory upon their children.
<br>17And let the graciousness of the Lord our God be upon us;
<br>Establish Thou also upon us the work of our hands;
<br>Yea, the work of our hands establish Thou it.
<br>
<br>O thou that dwellest in the covert of the Most High,
<br>And abidest in the shadow of the Almighty;
<br>2I will say of the LORD, who is my refuge and my fortress,
<br>My God, in whom I trust,
<br>3That He will deliver thee from the snare of the fowler,
<br>And from the noisome pestilence.
<br>4He will cover thee with His pinions,
<br>And under His wings shalt thou take refuge;
<br>His truth is a shield and a buckler.
<br>
<br>5Thou shalt not be afraid of the terror by night,
<br> 
<br>Nor of the arrow that flieth by day;
<br>6Of the pestilence that walketh in darkness,
<br>Nor of the destruction that wasteth at noonday.
<br>
<br>7A thousand may fall at Thy side, And ten thousand at Thy right hand; It shall not come nigh thee.
<br>8Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold,
<br>And see the recompense of the wicked.
<br>
<br>9For thou hast made the LORD who is my refuge,
<br>Even the Most High, thy habitation.
<br>10There shall no evil befall thee,
<br>Neither shall any plague come nigh thy tent.
<br>
<br>11For He will give His angels charge over thee,
<br>To keep thee in all thy ways.
<br>12They shall bear thee upon their hands,
<br>Lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.
<br>13Thou shalt tread upon the lion and asp;
<br>The young lion and the serpent shalt thou trample under feet.
<br>
<br>14'Because he hath set his love upon Me, therefore will I deliver him;
<br>I will set him on high, because he hath known My name.
<br>15He shall call upon Me, and I will answer him;
<br> 
<br>I will be with him in trouble;
<br>I will rescue him, and bring him to honour.
<br>16With long life will I satisfy him,
<br>And make Him to behold My salvation.'
<br>
<br>A Psalm, a Song. For the sabbath day.
<br>
<br>2It is a good thing to give thanks unto the LORD,
<br>And to sing praises unto Thy name, O Most High;
<br>3To declare Thy lovingkindness in the morning,
<br>And Thy faithfulness in the night seasons,
<br>4With an instrument of ten strings, and with the psaltery;
<br>With a solemn sound upon the harp.
<br>
<br>5For Thou, LORD, hast made me glad through Thy work;
<br>I will exult in the works of Thy hands.
<br>6How great are Thy works, O LORD! Thy thoughts are very deep.
<br>7A brutish man knoweth not, Neither doth a fool understand this. 8When the wicked spring up as the
<br>grass,
<br>And when all the workers of iniquity do flourish;
<br>It is that they may be destroyed for ever.
<br>
<br>9But Thou, O LORD, art on high for evermore.
<br> 
<br>10For, lo, Thine enemies, O LORD, For, lo, Thine enemies shall perish:
<br>All the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.
<br>11But my horn hast Thou exalted like the horn of the wild-ox;
<br>I am anointed with rich oil.
<br>12Mine eye also hath gazed on them that lie in wait for me,
<br>Mine ears have heard my desire of the evil-doers that rise up against me.
<br>
<br>13The righteous shall flourish like the palm-tree;
<br>He shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
<br>14Planted in the house of the LORD,
<br>They shall flourish in the courts of our God.
<br>15They shall still bring forth fruit in old age;
<br>They shall be full of sap and richness;
<br>16To declare that the LORD is upright,
<br>My Rock, in whom there is no unrighteousness.
<br>
<br>The LORD reigneth; He is clothed in majesty;
<br>The LORD is clothed, He hath girded Himself with strength;
<br>Yea, the world is established, that it cannot be moved.
<br>2Thy throne is established of old; Thou art from everlasting.
<br>
<br>3The floods have lifted up, O LORD,
<br> 
<br>The floods have lifted up their voice;
<br>The floods lift up their roaring. 4Above the voices of many waters, The mighty breakers of the sea, The LORD on high is mighty.
<br>
<br>5Thy testimonies are very sure, Holiness becometh Thy house, O LORD, for evermore.
<br>
<br>O LORD, Thou God to whom vengeance belongeth,
<br>Thou God to whom vengeance belongeth, shine forth.
<br>2Lift up Thyself, Thou Judge of the earth;
<br>Render to the proud their recompense.
<br>
<br>3LORD, how long shall the wicked, How long shall the wicked exult? 4They gush out, they speak
<br>arrogancy;
<br>All the workers of iniquity bear themselves loftily.
<br>5They crush Thy people, O LORD, And afflict Thy heritage.
<br>6They slay the widow and the stranger,
<br>And murder the fatherless.
<br>7And they say: 'The LORD will not see,
<br>Neither will the God of Jacob give heed.'
<br>
<br>8Consider, ye brutish among the people;
<br> 
<br>And ye fools, when will ye understand?
<br>9He that planted the ear, shall He not hear?
<br>He that formed the eye, shall He not see?
<br>10He that instructeth nations, shall not He correct?
<br>Even He that teacheth man knowledge?
<br>11The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man,
<br>That they are vanity.
<br>
<br>12Happy is the man whom Thou instructest, O LORD,
<br>And teachest out of Thy law;
<br>13That Thou mayest give him rest from the days of evil,
<br>Until the pit be digged for the wicked.
<br>14For the LORD will not cast off His people,
<br>Neither will He forsake His inheritance.
<br>15For right shall return unto justice,
<br>And all the upright in heart shall follow it.
<br>
<br>16Who will rise up for me against the evil-doers?
<br>Who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?
<br>17Unless the LORD had been my help, My soul had soon dwelt in silence. 18If I say: 'My foot slippeth',
<br>Thy mercy, O LORD, holdeth me up.
<br>19When my cares are many within me,
<br> 
<br>Thy comforts delight my soul.
<br>
<br>20Shall the seat of wickedness have fellowship with Thee,
<br>Which frameth mischief by statute?
<br>21They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous,
<br>And condemn innocent blood.
<br>22But the LORD hath been my high tower,
<br>And my God the rock of my refuge.
<br>23And He hath brought upon them their own iniquity,
<br>And will cut them off in their own evil;
<br>The LORD our God will cut them off.
<br>
<br>O come, let us sing unto the LORD;
<br>Let us shout for joy to the Rock of our salvation.
<br>2Let us come before His presence with thanksgiving,
<br>Let us shout for joy unto Him with psalms.
<br>3For the LORD is a great God, And a great King above all gods;
<br>4In whose hand are the depths of the earth;
<br>The heights of the mountains are His also.
<br>5The sea is His, and He made it; And His hands formed the dry land. 6O come, let us bow down and bend
<br>the knee;
<br>Let us kneel before the LORD our Maker;
<br>7For He is our God,
<br> 
<br>And we are the people of His pasture, and the flock of His hand.
<br>To-day, if ye would but hearken to His voice!
<br>8'Harden not your heart, as at Meribah,
<br>As in the day of Massah in the wilderness;
<br>9When your fathers tried Me, Proved Me, even though they saw
<br>My work.
<br>10For forty years was I wearied with that generation,
<br>And said: It is a people that do err in their heart,
<br>And they have not known My ways;
<br>11Wherefore I swore in My wrath,
<br>That they should not enter into My
<br>arest.'
<br>
<br>O sing unto the LORD a new song;
<br>Sing unto the LORD, all the earth.
<br>2Sing unto the LORD, bless His name;
<br>Proclaim His salvation from day to day.
<br>3Declare His glory among the nations,
<br>His marvellous works among all the peoples.
<br>
<br>4For great is the LORD, and highly to be praised;
<br>He is to be feared above all gods.
<br>
<br>
<br>a See Deut. xii, 9.
<br> 
<br>5For all the gods of the peoples are things of nought;
<br>But the LORD made the heavens.
<br>6Honour and majesty are before Him;
<br>Strength and beauty are in His sanctuary.
<br>
<br>7Ascribe unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the peoples,
<br>Ascribe unto the LORD glory and strength.
<br>8Ascribe unto the LORD the glory due unto His name;
<br>Bring an offering, and come into His courts.
<br>9O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness;
<br>Tremble before Him, all the earth.
<br>
<br>10Say among the nations: 'The LORD reigneth.'
<br>The world also is established that it cannot be moved;
<br>He will judge the peoples with equity.
<br>11Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice;
<br>Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof;
<br>12Let the field exult; and all that is therein;
<br>Then shall all the trees of the wood sing for joy;
<br>13Before the LORD, for He is come; For He is come to judge the earth;
<br>He will judge the world with righteousness,
<br>And the peoples in His faithfulness.
<br> 
<br>
<br>The LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice;
<br>Let the multitude of isles be glad.
<br>2Clouds and darkness are round about Him;
<br>Righteousness and justice are the foundation of His throne.
<br>3A fire goeth before Him,
<br>And burneth up His adversaries round about.
<br>
<br>4His lightnings lighted up the world; The earth saw, and trembled.
<br>5The mountains melted like wax at the presence of the LORD,
<br>At the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.
<br>6The heavens declared His righteousness,
<br>And all the peoples saw His glory.
<br>
<br>7Ashamed be all they that serve graven images,
