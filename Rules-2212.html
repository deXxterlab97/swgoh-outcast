<br>§3334g. Reports on intelligence community loan repayment and related programs
<br>(a) Sense of Congress
<br>
<br>It is the sense of Congress that—
<br>
<br>(1) there should be established, through the issuing of an Intelligence Community Directive or otherwise, an intelligence-community-wide program for student loan repayment, student loan forgiveness, financial counseling, and related matters, for employees of the intelligence community;
<br>
<br>(2) creating such a program would enhance the ability of the elements of the intelligence community to recruit, hire, and retain highly qualified personnel, including with respect to mission-critical and hard-to-fill positions;
<br>
<br>(3) such a program, including with respect to eligibility requirements, should be designed so as to maximize the ability of the elements of the intelligence community to recruit, hire, and retain highly qualified personnel, including with respect to mission-critical and hard-to-fill positions; and
<br>
<br>(4) to the extent possible, such a program should be uniform throughout the intelligence community and publicly promoted by each element of the intelligence community to both current employees of the element as well as to prospective employees of the element.
<br>(b) Report on potential intelligence community-wide program
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Not later than 180 days after December 20, 2019, the Director of National Intelligence, in cooperation with the heads of the elements of the intelligence community and the heads of any other appropriate department or agency of the Federal Government, shall submit to the congressional intelligence committees a report on potentially establishing and carrying out an intelligence-community-wide program for student loan repayment, student loan forgiveness, financial counseling, and related matters, as described in subsection (a).
<br>(2) Matters included
<br>
<br>The report under paragraph (1) shall include, at a minimum, the following:
<br>
<br>(A) A description of the financial resources that the elements of the intelligence community would require to establish and initially carry out the program specified in paragraph (1).
<br>
<br>(B) A description of the practical steps to establish and carry out such a program.
<br>
<br>(C) The identification of any legislative action the Director determines necessary to establish and carry out such a program.
<br>(c) Annual reports on established programs

<br>(2) Annual reports required
<br>
<br>Not less frequently than once each year, the Director of National Intelligence shall submit to the congressional intelligence committees a report on the covered programs. Each such report shall include, with respect to the period covered by the report, the following:
<br>
<br>(A) The number of personnel from each element of the intelligence community who used each covered program.
<br>
<br>(B) The total amount of funds each element expended for each such program.

<br>"(7) with respect to an element of the intelligence community within the Department of Energy, the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives; and
<br>
<br>"(8) with respect to an element of the intelligence community within the Department of the Treasury, the Committee on Finance of the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives.
<br>

<br>(3) Disclosures
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>A disclosure shall not be excluded from paragraph (1) because—
<br>
<br>(i) the disclosure was made to a person, including a supervisor, who participated in an activity that the employee reasonably believed to be covered by paragraph (1)(A)(ii);

<br>(4) Agency adjudication
<br>(A) Remedial procedure
<br>

<br>(B) Corrective action
<br>
<br>If, in the course of proceedings authorized under subparagraph (A), it is determined that the adverse security clearance or access determination violated paragraph (1), the agency shall take specific corrective action to return the employee or former employee, as nearly as practicable and reasonable, to the position such employee or former employee would have held had the violation not occurred. Such corrective action may include back pay and related benefits, travel expenses, and compensatory damages not to exceed $300,000.
<br>(C) Contributing factor
<br>
<br>In determining whether the adverse security clearance or access determination violated paragraph (1), the agency shall find that paragraph (1) was violated if a disclosure described in paragraph (1) was a contributing factor in the adverse security clearance or access determination taken against the individual, unless the agency demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have taken the same action in the absence of such disclosure, giving the utmost deference to the agency's assessment of the particular threat to the national security interests of the United States in the instant matter.
<br>(5) Appellate review of security clearance access determinations by Director of National Intelligence
<br>(A) Appeal
<br>

<br>
<br>The Director of National Intelligence, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of Defense, shall develop and implement policies and procedures for adjudicating the appeals authorized by subparagraph (A).
<br>(C) Congressional notification
<br>
<br>Consistent with the protection of sources and methods, at the time the Director of National Intelligence issues an order regarding an appeal pursuant to the policies and procedures established by this paragraph, the Director of National Intelligence shall notify the congressional intelligence committees.

<br>
<br>(A) agency action under this section; or
<br>
<br>(B) action of the appellate review procedures established under paragraph (5).
<br>(7) Private cause of action
<br>
<br>Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit, authorize, or require a private cause of action to challenge the merits of a security clearance determination.
