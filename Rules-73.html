<br> 
<br>46	And they came as far as Ephron: now this was a great city, situate in the way, strongly for- tified, and there was no means to turn from it on the right hand or on the left, but the way was through the midst of it.
<br>47	And they that were in the city shut them- selves in, and stopped up the gates with stones: and Judas sent to them with peaceable words,
<br>48	Saying: Let us pass through your land, to go into our own country, and no man shall hurt you; we will only pass through on foot. But they would not open to them.
<br>49	Then Judas commanded proclamation to be made in the camp, that they should make an assault, every man in the place where he was.
<br>50	And the men of the army drew near, and he assaulted that city all the day, and all the night; and the city was delivered into his hands: 51 And they slew every male with the edge of the sword, and he razed the city, and took the spoils thereof, and passed through all the city
<br>over them that were slain.
<br>52	Then they passed over the Jordan to the great plain that is over against Bethsan.
<br>53	And Judas gathered together the hind- most, and he exhorted the people, all the way through, till they came into the land of Juda.
<br>54	And they went up to mount Sion with joy and gladness, and offered holocausts, because not one of them was slain, till they had returned in peace.
<br>55	Now in the days that Judas and Jonathan were in the land of Galaad, and Simon his brother in Galilee, before Ptolemais,
<br>56	Joseph, the son of Zacharias, and Azarias, captain of the soldiers, heard of the good success, and the battles that were fought,
<br>57	And he said: Let us also get us a name, and let us go fight against the Gentiles that are round about us.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>58	And he gave charge to them that were in his army, and they went towards Jamnia.
<br>59	And Gorgias and his men went out of the city, to give them battle.
<br>60	And Joseph and Azarias were put to flight, and were pursued unto the borders of Judea: and there fell on that day, of the people of Israel, about two thousand men, and there was a great overthrow of the people:
<br>61	Because they did not hearken to Judas and his brethren, thinking that they should do man- fully.
<br>62	But they were not of the seed of those men by whom salvation was brought to Israel.
<br>63	And the men of Juda were magnified ex- ceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and of all the nations where their name was heard.
<br>64	And the people assembled to them with joyful acclamations.
<br>65	Then Judas and his brethren went forth and attacked the children of Esau, in the land towards the south, and he took Chebron and her towns: and he burnt the walls thereof, and the towers all round it.
<br>66	And he removed his camp to go into the land of the aliens, and he went through Samaria. 67 In that day some priests fell in battle, while desiring to do manfully they went out unadvis-
<br>edly to fight.
<br>68 And Judas turned to Azotus, into the land of the strangers, and he threw down their altars, and he burnt the statues of their gods with fire: and he took the spoils of the cities, and returned into the land of Juda.
<br>
<br>Chapter 6
<br>Now king Antiochus was going through the higher countries, and he heard that the city of
<br> 
<br>Elymais in Persia, was greatly renowned, and abounding in silver and gold,
<br>2	And that there was in it a temple exceeding rich; and coverings of gold, and breastplates, and shields, which king Alexander, son of Philip, the Macedonian, that reigned first in Greece, had left there.
<br>3	So he came, and sought to take the city and to pillage it; but he was not able, because the design was known to them that were in the city. 4 And they rose up against him in battle, and he fled away from thence, and departed with great sadness, and returned towards Babylonia. 5 And whilst he was in Persia there came one that told him how the armies that were in the
<br>land of Juda were put to flight:
<br>6	And that Lysias went with a very great power, and was put to flight before the face of the Jews, and that they were grown strong by the armour, and power, and store of spoils which they had gotten out of the camps which they had destroyed:
<br>7	And that they had thrown down the abom- ination which he had set up upon the altar in Jerusalem, and that they had compassed about the sanctuary with high walls as before, and Bethsura also, his city.
<br>8	And it came to pass, when the king heard these words, that he was struck with fear, and exceedingly moved: and he laid himself down upon his bed, and fell sick for grief, because it had not fallen out to him as he imagined.
<br>9	And he remained there many days: for great grief came more and more upon him, and he made account that he should die.
<br>10	And he called for all his friends, and said to them: Sleep is gone from my eyes, and I am fallen away, and my heart is cast down for anxiety:
<br>11	And I said in my heart: Into how much tribulation am I come, and into what floods of
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>sorrow wherein now I am: I that was pleasant and beloved in my power!
<br>12	But now I remember the evils that I did in Jerusalem, from whence also I took away all the spoils of gold, and of silver, that were in it, and I sent to destroy the inhabitants of Juda without cause.
<br>13	I know, therefore, that for this cause these evils have found me: and behold I perish with great grief in a strange land.
<br>14	Then he called Philip, one of his friends, and he made him regent over all his kingdom.
<br>15	And he gave him the crown, and his robe, and his ring, that he should go to Antiochus, his son, and should bring him up for the kingdom.
<br>16	So king Antiochus died there in the year one hundred and forty-nine.
<br>17	And Lysias understood that the king was dead, and he set up Antiochus, his son, to reign, whom he had brought up young: and he called his name Eupator.
<br>18	Now they that were in the castle, had shut up the Israelites round about the holy places: and they were continually seeking their hurt, and to strengthen the Gentiles.
<br>19	And Judas purposed to destroy them: and he called together all the people, to besiege them.
<br>20	And they came together, and besieged them in the year one hundred and fifty, and they made battering slings and engines.
<br>21	And some of the besieged got out: and some wicked men of Israel joined themselves unto them.
<br>22	And they went to the king, and said: How long dost thou delay to execute judgment, and to revenge our brethren?
<br>23	We determined to serve thy father, and to do according to his orders, and obey his edicts:
<br>24	And for this they of our nation are alien- ated from us, and have slain as many of us as
<br> 
<br>they could find, and have spoiled our inheri- tances.
<br>25	Neither have they put forth their hand against us only, but also against all our borders. 26 And behold they have approached this day to the castle of Jerusalem to take it, and they
<br>have fortified the strong hold of Bethsura:
<br>27	And unless thou speedily prevent them, they will do greater things than these, and thou shalt not be able to subdue them.
<br>28	Now when the king heard this, he was an- gry: and he called together all his friends, and the captains of his army, and them that were over the horsemen.
<br>29	There came also to him from other realms, and from the islands of the sea, hired troops.
<br>30	And the number of his army was an hun- dred thousand footmen, and twenty thousand horsemen, and thirty-two elephants trained to battle.
<br>31	And they went through Idumea, and ap- proached to Bethsura, and fought many days, and they made engines: but they sallied forth, and burnt them with fire, and fought manfully.
<br>32	And Judas departed from the   castle, and removed the camp to Bethzacharam, over against the king’s camp.
<br>33	And the king rose before it was light, and made his troops march on fiercely towards the way of Bethzacharam: and the armies made themselves ready for the battle, and they sounded the trumpets:
<br>34	And they shewed the elephants the blood of grapes, and mulberries, to provoke them to fight.
<br>35	And they distributed the beasts by the le- gions: and there stood by every elephant a thou- sand men in coats of mail, and with helmets of brass on their heads: and five hundred horsemen set in order were chosen for every beast.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>36	These before the time wheresoever the beast was they were there: and whithersoever it went, they went, and they departed not from it.
<br>37	And upon the beast, there were strong wooden towers which covered every one of them: and engines upon them, and upon every one thirty-two valiant men, who fought from above: and an Indian to rule the beast.
<br>38	And the rest of the horsemen he placed on this side and on that side, at the two wings, with trumpets to stir up the army, and to hasten them forward that stood thick together in the legions thereof.
<br>39	Now when the sun shone upon the shields of gold, and of brass, the mountains glittered therewith, and they shone like lamps of fire.
<br>40	And part of the king’s army was distin- guished by the high mountains, and the other part by the low places: and they marched on warily and orderly.
<br>41	And all the inhabitants of the land were moved at the noise of their multitude, and the marching of the company, and the rattling of the armour, for the army was exceeding great and strong.
<br>42	And Judas and his army drew near for bat- tle: and there fell of the king’s army six hundred men.
<br>43	And Eleazar, the son of Saura, saw one of the beasts harnessed with the king’s harness: and it was higher than the other beasts; and it seemed to him that the king was on it:
<br>44	And he exposed himself to deliver his peo- ple, and to get himself an everlasting name.
<br>45	And he ran up to it boldly in the midst of the legion, killing on the right hand, and on the left, and they fell by him on this side and that side.
<br>46	And he went between the feet of the ele-
<br> 
<br>phant, and put himself under it: and slew it, and it fell to the ground upon him, and he died there. 47 Then they seeing the strength of the king and the fierceness of his army, turned away from
<br>them.
<br>48	But the king’s army went up against them to Jerusalem: and the king’s army pitched their tents against Judea and Mount Sion.
<br>49	And he made peace with them that were in Bethsura: and they came forth out of the city, because they had no victuals, being shut up there, for it was the year of rest to the land. 50 And the king took Bethsura: and he placed
<br>there a garrison to keep it.
<br>51	And he turned his army against the sanc- tuary for many days: and he set up there batter- ing slings, and engines, and instruments to cast fire, and engines to cast stones and javelins, and pieces to shoot arrows, and slings.
<br>52	And they also made engines against their engines, and they fought for many days.
<br>53	But there were no victuals in the city, be- cause it was the seventh year: and such as had stayed in Judea of them that came from among the nations, had eaten the residue of all that which had been stored up.
<br>54	And there remained in the holy places but a few, for the famine had prevailed over them: and they were dispersed every man to his own place.
<br>55	Now Lysias heard that Philip; whom king Antiochus while he lived had appointed to bring up his son, Antiochus, and to reign,
<br>56	Was returned from Persia, and Media, with the army that went with him and that he sought to take upon him the affairs of the kingdom:
<br>57	Wherefore he made haste to go, and say to the king and to the captains of the army: We de- cay daily, and our provision of victuals is small, and the place that we lay siege to is strong, and
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>it lieth upon us to take order for the affairs of the kingdom.
<br>58	Now, therefore, let us come to an agree- ment with these men, and make peace with them and with all their nation.
<br>59	And let us covenant with them, that they may live according to their own laws, as before. For because of our despising their laws, they have been provoked, and have done all these things.
<br>60	And the proposal was acceptable in the sight of the king, and of the princes: and he sent to them to make peace: and they accepted of it.
<br>61	And the king and the princes swore to them: and they came out of the strong hold.
<br>62	Then the king entered into Mount Sion, and saw the strength of the place: and he quickly broke the oath that he had taken, and gave com- mandment to throw down the wall round about. 63 And he departed in haste and returned to Antioch, where he found Philip master of the city: and he fought against him, and took the
<br>city.
<br>
<br>Chapter 7
<br>In the hundred and fifty-first year, Demetrius, the son of Seleucus, departed from the city of Rome, and came up with few men into a city of the sea coast, and reigned there.
<br>2	And it came to pass as he entered into the house of the kingdom of his fathers, that the army seized upon Antiochus, and Lysias, to bring them unto hlm.
<br>3	And when he knew it, he said: Let me not see their face.
<br>4	So the army slew them. And Demetrius sat upon the throne of his kingdom:
<br>5	And there came to him the wicked and un- godly men of Israel: and Alcimus was at the head
<br> 
<br>of them, who desired to be made high priest.
<br>6	And they accused the people to the king, saying: Judas and his brethren have destroyed all thy friends, and he hath driven us out of our land.
<br>7	Now, therefore, send some men whom thou trustest, and let him go, and see all the havoc he hath made amongst us, and in the king’s lands: and let him punish all his friends and their helpers.
<br>8	Then the king chose Bacchides, one of his friends, that ruled beyond the great river in the kingdom, and was faithful to the king: and he sent him,
<br>9	To see the havoc that Judas had made: and the wicked Alcimus he made high priest, and commanded him to take revenge upon the chil- dren of Israel.
<br>11 But they gave no heed to their words: for they saw that they were come with a great army. 12 Then there assembled to Alcimus and Bac- chides a company of the scribes, to require things
<br>that are just:
<br>13	And first the Assideans, that were among the children of Israel, and they sought peace of them.
<br>14	For they said: One that is a priest of the seed of Aaron is come, he will not deceive us.
<br>15	And he spoke to them peaceably: and he swore to them, saying: We will do you no harm, nor your friends.
<br>16	And they believed him. And he took three- score of them, and slew them in one day, accord- ing to the word that is written:
<br>17	The flesh of thy saints, and the blood of them they have shed round about Jerusalem, and there was none to bury them.
<br>18	Then fear and trembling fell upon all the people: for they said: There is no truth, nor
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>justice among them: for they have broken the covenant, and the oath which they made.
<br>19	And Bacchides removed the camp from Jerusalem, and pitched in Bethzecha: and he sent, and took many of them that were fled away from him, and some of the people he killed, and threw them into a great pit.
<br>20	Then he committed the country to Al- cimus, and left with him troops to help him. So Bacchides went away to the king.
<br>21	But Alcimus did what he could to maintain his chief priesthood.
<br>22	And they that disturbed the people re- sorted to him, and they got the land of Juda into their power, and did much hurt in Israel.
<br>23	And Judas saw all the evils that Alcimus, and they that were with him, did to the children of Israel, much more than the Gentiles.
<br>24	And he went out into all the coasts of Judea round about, and took vengeance upon the men that had revolted, and they ceased to go forth any more into the country.
<br>25	And Alcimus saw that Judas and they that were with him, prevailed: and he knew that he could not stand against them, and he went back to the king, and accused them of many crimes.
<br>26	And the king sent Nicanor, one of his prin- cipal lords, who was a great enemy to Israel: and he commanded him to destroy the people.
<br>27	And Nicanor came to Jerusalem with a great army, and he sent to Judas and to his brethren deceitfully, with friendly words,
<br>28	Saying: Let there be no fighting between me and you: I will come with a few men, to see your faces with peace.
<br>29	And he came to Judas, and they saluted one another peaceably: and the enemies were prepared to take away Judas by force.
<br>30	And the thing was known to Judas that he was come to him with deceit: and he was much
<br> 
<br>afraid of him, and would not see his face any more.
<br>31	And Nicanor knew that his counsel was dis- covered: and he went out to fight against Judas, near Capharsalama.
<br>32	And there fell of Nicanor’s army almost five thousand men, and they fled into the city of David.
<br>33	And after this Nicanor went up into mount Sion: and some of the priests and the people came out to salute him peaceably, and to shew him the holocausts that were offered for the king. 34 But he mocked and despised them, and
<br>abused them: and he spoke proudly,
<br>35	And swore in anger, saying: Unless Judas and his army be delivered into my hands, as soon as ever I return in peace, I will burn this house. And he went out in a great rage.
<br>36	And the priests went in, and stood before the face of the altar and the temple: and weep- ing, they said:
<br>37	Thou, O Lord, hast chosen this house for thy name to be called upon therein, that it might be a house of prayer and supplication for thy people.
<br>38	Be avenged of this man, and his army, and let them fall by the sword: remember their blas- phemies, and suffer them not to continne any longer.
<br>39	Then Nicanor went out from Jerusalem, and encamped near to Bethoron: and an army of Syria joined him.
<br>40	But Judas pitched in Adarsa with three thousand men: and Judas prayed, and said:
<br>41	O Lord, when they that were sent by king Sennacherib blasphemed thee, an angel went out, and slew of them a hundred and eighty-five thou- sand:
<br>42	Even so destroy this army in our sight to- day and let the rest know that he hath spoken
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>ill against thy sanctuary: and judge thou him according to his wickedness.
<br>43	And the armies joined battle on the thir- teenth day of the month, Adar: and the army of Nicanor was defeated, and he himself was first slain in the battle.
<br>44	And when his army saw that Nicanor was slain they threw away their weapons, and fled:
<br>45	And they pursued after them one day’s journey from Adazer, even till ye come to Gazara, and they sounded the trumpets after them with signals.
<br>46	And they went forth out of all the towns of Judea round about, and they pushed them with the horns, and they turned again to them, and they were all slain with the sword, and there was not left of them so much as one.
<br>47	And they took the spoils of them for a booty, and they cut off Nicanor’s head, and his right hand, which he had proudly stretched out, and they brought it, and hung it up over against Jerusalem.
<br>48	And the people rejoiced exceedingly, and they spent that day with great joy.
<br>49	And he ordained that this day should be kept every year, being the thirteenth of the month of Adar
<br>50	And the land of Juda was quiet for a short time.
<br>
<br>Chapter 8
<br>Now Judas heard of the fame of the Romans, that they are powerful and strong, and willingly agree to all things that are requested of them: and that whosoever have come to them, they have made amity with them, and that they are mighty in power.
<br>2 And they heard of their battles, and their
<br> 
<br>noble acts which they had done in Galatia, how they had conquered them, and brought them un- der tribute:
<br>3	And how great things they had done in the land of Spain, and that they had brought under their power the mines of silver and of gold that are there, and had gotten possession of all the place by their counsel and patience:
<br>4	And had conquered places that were very far off from them, and kings that came against them from the ends of the earth, and had over- thrown them with great slaughter: and the rest pay them tribute every year.
<br>5	And that they had defeated in battle Philip and Perses the king of the Ceteans, and the rest that had borne arms against them, and had con- quered them:
<br>6	And how Antiochus, the great king of Asia, who went to fight against them, having a hun- dred and twenty elephants, with horsemen, and chariots, and a very great army, was routed by them.
<br>7	And how they took him alive, and appointed to him, that both he and they that should reign after him, should pay a great tribute, and that he should give hostages, and that which was agreed upon,
<br>8	And the country of the Indians, and of the Medes, and of the Lydians, some of their best provinces: and those which they had taken from them, they gave to king Eumenes.
<br>9	And that they who were in Greece, had a mind to go and to destroy them: and they had knowledge thereof,
<br>10	And they sent a general against them, and fought with them, and many of them were slain, and they carried away their wives, and their chil- dren captives, and spoiled them, and took pos- session of their land, and threw down their walls, and brought them to be their servants unto this
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>day.
<br>11	And the other kingdoms, and islands, that at any time had resisted them, they had de- stroyed and brought under their power.
<br>12	But with their friends, and such as relied upon them, they kept amity, and had conquered kingdoms that were near, and that were far off: for all that heard their name, were afraid of them.
<br>13	That whom they had a mind to help to a kingdom, those reigned: and whom they would, they deposed from the kingdom: and they were greatly exalted.
<br>14	And none of all these wore a crown, or was clothed in purple, to be magnified thereby.
<br>15	And that they had made themselves a sen- ate house, and consulted daily three hundred and twenty men, that sat in counsel always for the people, that they might do the things that were right:
<br>16	And that they committed their government to one man every year, to rule over all their coun- try, and they all obey one, and there is no envy nor jealousy amongst them.
<br>17	So Judas chose Eupolemus, the son of John, the son of Jacob, and Jason, the son of Eleazar, and he sent them to Rome to make a league of amity and confederacy with them:
<br>18	And that they might take off from them the yoke of the Grecians, for they saw that they oppressed the kingdom of Israel with servitude. 19 And they went to Rome, a very long jour- ney, and they entered into the senate house, and
<br>said:
<br>20	Judas Machabeus, and his brethren, and the people of the Jews, have sent us to you to make alliance and peace with you, and that we may be registered your confederates and friends.
<br>21	And the proposal was pleasing in their sight.
<br> 
<br>22	And this is the copy of the writing that they wrote back again, graven in tables of brass, and sent to Jerusalem, that it might be with them there for a memorial of the peace, and al- liance.
<br>23	GOOD SUCCESS BE TO THE ROMANS,
<br>and to the people of the Jews by sea, and by land, for ever: and far be the sword and enemy from them.
<br>24	But if there come first any war upon the Romans, or any of their confederates, in all their dominions:
<br>25	The nation of the Jews shall help them according as the time shall direct, with all their heart:
<br>26	Neither shall they give them, whilst they are fighting, or furnish them with wheat, or arms, or money, or ships, as it hath seemed good to the Romans: and they shall obey their orders, without taking any thing of them.
<br>27	In like manner also if war shall come first upon the nation of the Jews, the Romans shall help them with all their heart, according as the time shall permit them:
<br>28	And there shall not be given to them that come to their aid, either wheat, or arms, or money, or ships, as it hath seemed good to the Romans: and they shall observe their orders without deceit.
<br>29	According to these articles did the Romans covenant with the people of the Jews.
<br>30	And, if after this, one party or the other shall have a mind to add to these articles, or take away any thing, they may do it at their pleasure: and whatsoever they shall add, or take away, shall be ratified.
<br>31	Moreover, concerning the evils that Demetrius, the king, hath done against them, we have written to him, saying: Why hast thou made thy yoke heavy upon our friends and allies,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>the Jews.
<br>32	If, therefore, they come again to us com- plaining of thee, we will do them justice, and will make war against thee by sea and land.
<br>
<br>Chapter 9
<br>In the mean time, when Demetrius heard that Nicanor and his army were fallen in battle, he sent again Bacchides and Alcimus into Judea; and the right wing of his army with them.
<br>2	And they took the road that leadeth to Gal- gal, and they camped in Masaloth, which is in Arabella: and they made themselves masters of it, and slew many people.
<br>3	In the first month of the hundred and fifty- second year they brought the army to Jerusalem:
<br>4	And they arose and went to Berea, with twenty thousand men, and two thousand horse- men.
<br>5	Now Judas had pitched his tents in Laisa, and three thousand chosen men with him:
<br>6	And they saw the multitude of the army that they were many, and they were seized with great fear: and many withdrew themselves out of the camp, and there remained of them no more than eight hundred men.
<br>7	And Judas saw that his army slipped away, and the battle pressed upon him, and his heart was cast down: because he had not time to gather them together, and he was discouraged.
<br>8	Then he said to them that remained: Let us arise, and go against our enemies, if we may be able to fight against them.
<br>9	But they dissuaded him, saying: We shall not be able, but let us save our lives now, and return to our brethren, and then we will fight against them: for we are but few.
<br>10	Then Judas said:   God forbid we should
<br> 
<br>do this thing, and flee away from them: but if our time be come, let us die manfully for our brethren, and let us not stain our glory.
<br>11	And the army removed out of the camp, and they stood over against them: and the horsemen were divided into two troops, and the slingers, and the archers, went before the army, and they that were in the front were all men of valour.
<br>12	And Bacchides was in the right wing, and the legion drew near on two sides, and they sounded the trumpets:
<br>13	And they also that were on Judas’s side, even they also cried out, and the earth shook at the noise of the armies: and the battle was fought from morning even unto the evening.
<br>14	And Judas perceived that the stronger part of the army of Bacchides was on the right side, and all the stout of heart came together with him:
<br>15	And the right wing was discomfited by them, and he pursued them even to the mount Azotus.
<br>16	And they that were in the left wing saw that the right wing was discomfited, and they followed after Judas, and them that were with him, at their back:
<br>17	And the battle was hard fought, and there fell many wounded of the one side and of the other.
<br>18	And Judas was slain, and the rest fled away.
<br>19	And Jonathan and Simon took Judas, their brother, and buried him in the sepulchre of their fathers, in the city of Modin.
<br>20	And all the people of Israel bewailed him with great lamentation, and they mourned for him many days.
<br>21	And said: How is the mighty man fallen, that saved the people of Israel!
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>22	But the rest of the words of the wars of Judas, and of the noble acts that he did, and of his greatness, are not written: for they were very many.
<br>23	And it came to pass, after the death of Judas, that the wicked began to put forth their heads in all the confines of Israel, and all the workers of iniquity rose up.
<br>24	In those days there was a very great famine, and they and all their country yielded to Bac- chides.
<br>25	And Bacchides chose the wicked men, and made them lords of the country:
<br>26	And they sought out, and made diligent search after the friends of Judas, and brought them to Bacchides, and he took vengeance of them, and abused them.
<br>27	And there was a great tribulation in Israel, such as was not since the day, that there was no prophet seen in Israel.
<br>28	And all the friends of Judas came together, and said to Jonathan:
<br>29	Since thy brother Judas died there is not a man like him to go forth against our enemies, Bacchides, and them that are the enemies of our nation.
<br>30	Now, therefore, we have chosen thee this day to be our prince, and captain, in his stead, to fight our battles.
<br>31	So Jonathan took upon him the govern- ment at that time, and rose up in the place of Judas, his brother
<br>32	And Bacchides had knowledge of it, and sought to kill him.
<br>33	And Jonathan, and Simon, his brother, knew it, and all that were with them: and they fled into the desert of Thecua, and they pitched by the water of the lake Asphar,
<br>34	And Bacchides understood it, and he came himself, with all his army, over the Jordan, on
<br> 
<br>the sabbath day.
<br>35	And Jonathan sent his brother, a captain of the people, to desire the Nabutheans his friends, that they would lend them their equipage, which was copious.
<br>36	And the children of Jambri came forth out of Madaba, and took John, and all that he had, and went away with them.
<br>37	After this it was told Jonathan, and Simon, his brother, that the children of Jambri made a great marriage, and were bringing the bride out of Madaba, the daughter of one of the great princes of Chanaan, with great pomp.
<br>38	And they remembered the blood of John, their brother: and they went up, and hid them- selves under the covert of the mountain.
<br>39	And they lifted up their eyes, and saw: and behold a tumult, and great preparation: and the bridegroom came forth, and his friends, and his brethren to meet them with timbrels, and musi- cal instruments and many weapons.
<br>40	And they rose up against them from the place where they lay in ambush, and slew them, and there fell many wounded, and the rest fled into the mountains, and they took all their spoils:
<br>41	And the marriage was turned into mourn- ing, and the noise of their musical instruments into lamentation.
<br>42	And they took revenge for the blood of their brother: and they returned to the bank of the Jordan.
<br>43	And Bacchides heard it, and he came on the sabbath day even to the bank of the Jordan, with a great power.
<br>44	And Jonathan said to his company: Let us arise, and fight against our enemies: for it is not now as yesterday, and the day before.
<br>45	For behold the battle is before us, and the water of the Jordan on this side and on that side,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>and banks, and marshes, and woods: and there is no place for us to turn aside.
<br>46	Now, therefore, cry ye to heaven, that ye may be delivered from the hand of your enemies. And they joined battle.
<br>47	And Jonathan stretched forth his hand to strike Bacchides, but he turned away from him backwards.
<br>48	And Jonathan, and they that were with him, leapt into the Jordan, and swam over the Jordan to them.
<br>49	And there fell of Bacchides’ side that day a thousand men: and they returned to Jerusalem, 50 And they built strong cities in Judea, the fortress that was in Jericho, and in Ammaus, and in Bethoron, and in Bethel, and Thamnata, and Phara, and Thopo, with high walls, and gates,
<br>and bars.
<br>51	And he placed garrisons in them, that they might wage war against Israel:
<br>52	And he fortified the city of Bethsura, and Gazara, and the castle, and set garrisons in them, and provi- sions of victuals:
<br>53	And he took the sons of the chief men of the country for hostages, and put them in the castle in Jerusalem in custody.
<br>54	Now in the year one hundred and fifty- three, the second month, Alcimus commanded the walls of the inner court of the sanctuary to be thrown down, and the works of the prophets to be destroyed: and he began to destroy.
<br>55	At that time Alcimus was struck: and his works were hindered, and his mouth was stopped, and he was taken with a palsy, so that he could no more speak a word, nor give order concerning his house.
<br>56	And Alcimus died at that time in great torment.
<br>57	And Bacchides saw that Alcimus was dead: and he returned to the king, and the land was
<br> 
<br>quiet for two years.
<br>58	And all the wicked held a council, saying: Behold Jonathan, and they that are with him, dwell at ease and without fear: now, therefore, let us bring Bacchides hither, and he shall take them all in one night.
<br>59	So they went, and gave him counsel.
<br>60	And he arose to come with a great army: and he sent secretly letters to his adherents that were in Judea to seize upon Jonathan, and them that were with him: but they could not, for their design was known to them.
<br>61	And he apprehended of the men of the country, that were the principal authors of the mischief, fifty men, and he slew them.
<br>62	And Jonathan, and Simon, and they that were with him, retired into Bethbessen, which is in the desert: and he repaired the breaches thereof, and they fortified it.
<br>63	And when Bacchides knew it, he gath- ered together all his multitude: and sent word to them that were of Judea.
<br>64	And he came, and camped above Bethbessen, and fought against it many days, and made engines.
<br>65	But Jonathan left his brother, Simon, in the city and went forth into the country, and came with a number of men,
<br>66	And struck Odares, and his brethren, and the children of Phaseron, in their tents, and he began to slay, and to increase in forces.
<br>67	But Simon, and they that were with him, sallied out of the city, and burnt the engines,
<br>68	And they fought against Bacchides, and he was discomfited by them: and they afflicted him exceedingly, for his counsel, and his enterprise was in vain.
<br>69	And he was angry with the wicked men that had given him counsel to come into their
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>country, and he slew many of them: and he pur- posed to return with the rest into their country. 70 And Jonathan had knowledge of it, and he sent ambassadors to him to make peace with
<br>him, and to restore to him the prisoners.
<br>71	And he accepted it willingly, and did ac- cording to his words, and swore that he would do him no harm all the days of his life.
<br>72	And he restored to him the prisoners which he before had taken out of the land of Juda: and he returned, and went away into his own country, and he came no more into their borders.
<br>73	So the sword ceased from Israel: and Jonathan dwelt in Machmas, and Jonathan be- gan there to judge the people, and he destroyed the wicked out of Israel.
<br>
<br>Chapter 10
<br>Now in the hundred and sixtieth year, Alexan- der, the son of Antiochus, surnamed the Illus- trious, came up and took Ptolemais, and they received him, and he reigned there.
<br>2	And king Demetrius heard of it, and gath- ered together an exceeding great army, and went forth against him to fight.
<br>3	And Demetrius sent a letter to Jonathan, with peaceable words, to magnify him.
<br>4	For he said: Let us first make a peace with him, before he make one with Alexander against us.
<br>5	For he will remember all the evils that we have done against him, and against his brother, and against his nation.
<br>6	And he gave him authority to gather to- gether a army, and to make arms, and that he should be his confederate: and the hostages that were in the castle, he commanded to be delivered to him.
<br> 
<br>7	And Jonathan came to Jerusalem, and read the letters in the hearing of all the people, and of them that were in the castle.
<br>8	And they were struck with great fear, be- cause they heard that the king had given him authority to gather together an army.
<br>9	And	the	hostages	were	delivered	to Jonathan, and he restored them to their parents. 10 And Jonathan dwelt in Jerusalem, and be-
<br>gan to build, and to repair the city.
<br>11	And he ordered workmen to build the walls, and mount Sion round about with square stones for fortification: and so they did.
<br>12	Then the strangers that were in the strong holds, which Bacchides had built, fled away.
<br>13	And every man left his place, and departed into his own country:
<br>14	Only in Bethsura there remained some of them, that had forsaken the law, and the com- mandments of God: for this was a place of refuge for them.
<br>15	And king Alexander heard of the promises that Demetrius had made Jonathan: and they told him of the battles, and the worthy acts that he and his brethren had done, and the labours that they had endured.
<br>16	And he said: Shall we find such another man? now, therefore, we will make him our friend and our confederate.
<br>17	So he wrote a letter, and sent it to him according to these words, saying:
<br>18	King Alexander to his brother, Jonathan, greetings.
<br>19	We have heard of thee, that thou art a man of great power, and fit to be our friend:
<br>20	Now therefore, we make thee this day high priest of thy nation, and that thou be called the king’s friend, (and he sent him a purple robe, and a crown of gold) and that thou be of one
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>mind with us in our affairs, and keep friendship with us.
<br>21	Then Jonathan put on the holy vestment in the seventh month, in the year one hundred and threescore, at the feast day of the tabernacles: and he gathered together an army, and made a great number of arms.
<br>22	And Demetrius heard these words, and was exceeding sorry, and said:
<br>23	What is this that we have done, that Alexander hath prevented us to gain the friend- ship of the Jews to strengthen himself?
<br>24	I also will write to them words of request, and offer dignities, and gifts: that they may be with me to aid me.
<br>25	And he wrote to them in these words: King Demetrius to the nation of tbe Jews, greeting.
<br>26	Whereas you have kept covenant with us, and have continued in our friendship, and have not joined with our enemies, we have heard of it, and are glad.
<br>27	Wherefore now continue still to keep fi- delity towards us, and we will reward you with good things, for what you have done in our be- half.
<br>28	And we will remit to you many charges, and will give you gifts.
<br>29	And now I free you, and all the Jews, from tributes, and I release you from the customs of salt, and remit the crowns, and the thirds of the seed:
<br>30	And the half of the fruit of trees, which is my share, I leave to you from this day forward, so that it shall not be taken of the land of Juda, and of the three cities that are added thereto out of Samaria and Galilee, from this day forth, and for ever:
<br>31	And let Jerusalem be holy and free, with the borders thereof: and let the tenths, and trib- utes be for itself.
<br> 
<br>32	I yield up also the power of the castle that is in Jerusalem, and I give it to the high priest, to place therein such men as he shall choose, to keep it.
<br>33	And every soul of the Jews that hath been carried captive from the land of Juda in all my kingdom, I set at liberty freely, that all be dis- charged from tributes, even of their cattle.
<br>34	And I will that all the feasts, and the sab- baths, and the new moons, and the days ap- pointed, and three days before the solemn day, and three days after the solemn day, be all days of immunity and freedom, for all the Jews that are in my kingdom:
<br>35	And no man shall have power to do any thing against them, or to molest any of them, in any cause.
<br>36	And let there be enrolled in the king’s army to the number of thirty thousand of the Jews: and allowance shall be made them, as is due to all the king’s forces and certain of them shall be appointed to be in the fortresses of the great king:
<br>37	And some of them shall be set over the affairs of the kingdom, that are of trust, and let the governors be taken from among themselves, and let them walk in their own laws, as the king hath commanded in the land of Juda.
<br>38	And the three cities that are added to Judea, out of the country of Samaria, let them be accounted with Judea: that they may be un- der one, and obey no other authority but that of the high priest:
<br>39	Ptolemais and the confines thereof, I give as a free gift to the holy places that are in Jerusalem, for the necessary charges of the holy things.
<br>40	And I give every year fifteen thousand sick- les of silver out of the king’s accounts, of what belongs to me:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>41	And all that is above, which they that were over the affairs the years before, had not paid, from this time they shall give it to the works of the house.
<br>42	Moreover, the five thousand sickles of sil- ver, which they received from the account of the holy places, every year, shall also belong to the priests that execute the ministry.
<br>43	And whosoever shall flee into the tem- ple that is in Jerusalem, and in all the borders thereof, being indebted to the king for any mat- ter, let them be set at liberty, and all that they have in my kingdom, let them have it free.
<br>44	For the building also, or repairing the works of the holy places, the charges shall be given out of the king’s revenues:
<br>45	For the building also of the walls of Jerusalem, and the fortifying thereof round about, the charges shall be given out of the king’s account, as also for the building of the walls in Judea.
<br>46	Now when Jonathan and the people heard these words, they gave no credit to them, nor re- ceived them because they remembered the great evil that he had done in Israel, for he had af- flicted them exceedingly.
<br>47	And their inclinations were towards Alexander, because he had been the chief pro- moter of peace in their regard, and him they always helped.
<br>48	And king Alexander gathered together a great army, and moved his camp near to Demetrius.
<br>49	And the two kings joined battle, and the army of Demetrius fled away, and Alexander pur- sued after him, and pressed them close.
<br>50	And the battle was hard fought, till the sun went down: and Demetrius was slain that day.
<br>51	And Alexander sent ambassadors to Ptole- mee king of Egypt, with words to this effect, say-
<br> 
<br>ing:
<br>52	Forasmuch as I am returned into my king- dom and am set in the throne of my ancestors, and have gotten the dominion, and have over- thrown Demetrius and possessed our country,
<br>53	And have joined battle with him, and both he and his army have been destroyed by us, and we are placed in the throne of his kingdom:
<br>54	Now, therefore, let us make friendship one with another: and give me now thy daughter to wife, and I will be thy son in law, and I will give both thee and her gifts worthy of thee.
<br>55	And king Ptolomee answered, saying: Happy is the day wherein thou didst return to the land of thy fathers, and sattest in the throne of their kingdom.
<br>56	And now I will do to thee as thou hast written but meet me at Ptolemais, that we may see one another, and I may give her to thee as thou hast said.
<br>57	So Ptolemee went out of Egypt, with Cleopatra his daughter, and he came to Ptole- mais, in the hundred and sixty-second year.
<br>58	And king Alexander met him, and he gave him his daughter, Cleopatra: and he celebrated her marriage at Ptolemais with great glory, after the manner of kings.
<br>59	And king Alexander wrote to Jonathan, that he should come and meet him.
<br>60	And he went honourably to Ptolemais, and he met there the two kings, and he gave them much silver, and gold, and presents: and he found favour in their sight.
<br>61	And some pestilent men of Israel, men of a wicked life, assembled themselves against him, to accuse him: and the king gave no heed to them. 62 And he commanded that Jonathan’s gar- ments should he taken off, and that he shonld be clothed with purple: and they did so. And the
<br>king made him sit by himself.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>63	And he said to his princes: Go out with him into the midst of the city, and make procla- mation, that no man complain against him of any matter, and that no man trouble him for any manner of cause.
<br>64	So when his accusers saw his glory pro- claimed, and him clothed with purple, they all fled away.
<br>65	And the king magnified him, and enrolled him amongst his chief friends, and made him governor, and partaker of his dominion.
<br>66	And Jonathan returned into Jerusalem with peace and joy.
<br>67	In the year one hundred and sixty-five, Demetrius, the son of Demetrius, came from Crete into the land of his fathers.
<br>68	And king Alexander heard of it, and was much troubled, and returned to Antioch.
<br>69	And king Demetrius made Apollonius his general, who was governor of Celesyria: and he gathered together a great army, and came to Jamnia: and he sent to Jonathan, the high priest,
<br>70	Saying: Thou alone standest against us, and I am laughed at and reproached, because thou shewest thy power against us in the moun- tuins.
<br>71	Now, therefore, if thou trustest in thy forces, come down to us into the plain, and there let us try one another: for with me is the strength of war.
<br>72	Ask, and learn who I am, and the rest that help me, who also say that your foot cannot stand before our face, for thy fathers have twice been put to flight in their own land:
<br>73	And now how wilt thou be able to abide the horsemen, and so great an army in the plain, where there is no stone, nor rock, nor place to flee to?
<br>74	Now when Jonathan heard the words of
<br> 
<br>Apollonius, he was moved in his mind:   and he chose ten thousand men, and went out of Jerusalem, and Simon, his brother, met him to help him.
<br>75	And they pitched their tents near Joppe, but they shut him out of the city: because a garrison of Apollonius was in Joppe, and he laid siege to it.
<br>76	And they that were in the city being af- frighted, opened the gates to him: so Jonathan took Joppe.
<br>77	And Apollonius heard of it, and he took three thousand horsemen, and a great army.
<br>78	And he went to Azotus, as one that was making a journey, and immediately he went forth into the plain: because he had a great num- ber of horsemen, and he trusted in them. And Jonathan followed after him to Azotus, and they joined battle.
<br>79	And Apollonius left privately in the camp a thousand horsemen behind them.
<br>80	And Jonathan knew that there was an am- bush behind him, and they surrounded his army, and cast darts at the people from morning till evening.
<br>81	But the people stood still, as Jonathan had commanded them: and so their horses were fa- tigued.
<br>82	Then Simon drew forth his army, and at- tacked the legion: for the horsemen were wea- ried: and they were discomfited by him, and fled. 83 And they that were scattered about the plain fled into Azotus, and went into Bethdagon,
<br>their idol’s temple, there to save themselves.
<br>84	But Jonathan set fire to Azotus, and the cities that were round about it, and took the spoils of them and the temple of Dagon: and all them that were fled into it, he burnt with fire.
<br>85	So they that were slain by the sword, with them that were burnt, were almost eight thou-
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>sand men.
<br>86	And Jonathan, removed his army from thence and camped against Ascalon: and they went out of the city to meet him with great hon- our.
<br>87	And Jonathan returned into Jerusalem with his people, having many spoils.
<br>88	And it came to pass, when Alexander, the king heard these words, that he honoured Jonathan yet more.
<br>89	And he sent him a buckle of gold, as the custom is, to be given to such as are of the royal blood. And he gave him Accaron, and all the borders thereof, in possession.
<br>
<br>Chapter 11
<br>And the king of Egypt gathered together an army, like the sand that lieth upon the sea shore, and many ships: and he sought to get the king- dom of Alexander by deceit, and join it to his own kingdom.
<br>2	And he went out into Syria with peaceable words and they opened to him the cities, and met him: for king Alexander had ordered them to go forth to meet him, because he was his father in law.
<br>3	Now when Ptolemee entered into the cities, he put garrisons of soldiers in every city.
<br>4	And when he came near to Azotns, they shewed him the temple of Dagon that was burnt with fire, and Azotus, and the suburbs thereof, that were destroyed, and the bodies that were cast abroad, and the graves of them that were slain in the battle, which they had made near the way.
<br>5	And they told the king that Jonathan had done these things, to make him odious: but the king held his peace.
<br> 
<br>6	And Jonathan came to meet the king at Joppe with glory, and they saluted one another, and they lodged there.
<br>7	And Jonathan went with the king as far as the river, called Eleutherus: and he returned into Jerusalem.
<br>8	And king Ptolemee got the dominion of the cities by the sea side, even to Seleucia, and he devised evil designs against Alexander.
<br>9	And he sent ambassadors to Demetrius, say- ing: Come, let us make a league between us, and I will give thee my daughter whom Alexander hath, and thou shalt reign in the kingdom of thy father.
<br>10	For I repent that I have given him my daughter: for he hath sought to kill me.
<br>11	And he slandered him, because he coveted his kingdom,
<br>12	And he took away his daughter, and gave her to Demetrius, and alienated himself from Alexander, and his enmities were made manifest. 13 And Ptolemee entered into Antioch, and set two crowns upon his head, that of Egypt,
<br>and that of Asia.
<br>14	Now king Alexander was in Cilicia at that time: because they that were in those places had rebelled.
<br>15	And when Alexander heard of it, he came to give him battle: and king Ptolemee brought forth his army, and met him with a strong power, and put him to flight.
<br>16	And Alexander fled into Arabia, there to be protected: and king Ptolemee was exalted.
<br>17	And Zabdiel the Arabian took off Alexan- der’s head, and sent it to Ptolemee.
<br>18	And king Ptolemee died the third day af- ter: and they that were in the strong holds were destroyed by them that were within the camp.
<br>19	And Demetrius reigned in the hundred and sixty- seventh year.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>20	In those days Jonathan gathered together them that were in Judea, to take the castle that was in Jerusalem: and they made many engines of war against it.
<br>21	Then some wicked men that hated their own nation, went away to king Demetrius, and told him that Jonathan was besieging the castle. 22 And when he heard it, he was angry: and forthwith he came to Ptolemais, and wrote to Jonathan that he should not besiege the castle, but should come to him in haste, and speak to
<br>him.
<br>23	But when Jonathan heard this, he bade them besiege it still: and he chose some of the ancients of Israel, and of the priests, and put himself in danger
<br>24	And he took gold, and silver, and raiment, and many other presents, and went to the king to Ptolemais and he found favour in his sight.
<br>25	And certain wicked men of his nation made complaints against him.
<br>26	And the king treated him as his predeces- sors had done before: and he exalted him in the sight of all his friends.
<br>27	And he confirmed him in the high priest- hood and all the honours he had before, and he made him the chief of his friends.
<br>28	And Jonathan requested of the king that he would make Judea free from tribute, and the three governments, and Samaria, and the con- fines thereof: and he promised him three hun- dred talents.
<br>29	And the king consented: and he wrote let- ters to Jonathan of all these things, to this effect. 30 King Demetrius to his brother, Jonathan,
<br>and to the nation of the Jews, greeting.
<br>31 We send you here a copy of the letter which we have written to Lasthenes, our parent, con- cerning you, that you might know it.
<br> 
<br>32	King Demetrius to Lasthenes, his parent, greetings.
<br>33	We have determined to do good to the na- tion of the Jews, who are our friends, and keep the things that are just with us, for their good will which they bear towards us.
<br>34	We have ratified, therefore, unto them all the borders of Judea, and the three cities, Apherema, Lydda, and Ramatha, which are added to Judea, out of Samaria, and all their confines, to be set apart to all them that sacri- fice in Jerusalem, instead of the payments which the king received of them every year, and for the fruits of the land, and of the trees.
<br>35	And as for other things that belonged to us of the tithes, and of the tributes, from this time we discharge them of them: the saltpans also, and the crowns that were presented to us.
<br>36	We give all to them, and nothing hereof shall be revoked from this time forth and for ever.
<br>37	Now, therefore, see that thou make a copy of these things, and let it be given to Jonathan, and set upon the holy mountain, in a conspicu- ous place.
<br>38	And king Demetrius, seeing that the land was quiet before him, and nothing resisted him, sent away all his forces, every man to his own place, except the foreign army, which he had drawn together from the islands of the nations: so all the troops of his fathers hated him.
<br>39	Now there was one Tryphon who had been of Alexander’s party before: who seeing that all the army murmured against Demetrius, went to Emalchuel, the Arabian, who brought up Anti- ochus, the son of Alexander:
<br>40	And he pressed him much to deliver him to him, that he might be king in his father’s place: and he told him all that Demetrius had done, and how his soldiers hated him. And he
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>remained there many days.
<br>41	And Jonathan sent to king Demetrius, de- siring that he would cast out them that were in the castle in Jerusalem, and those that were in the strong holds: because they fought against Israel.
<br>42	And Demetrius sent to Jonathan, saying: I will not only do this for thee, and for thy people, but I will greatly honour thee, and thy nation, when opportunity shall serve.
<br>43	Now, therefore, thou shalt do well if thou send me men to help me: for all my army is gone from me.
<br>44	And Jonathan sent him three thousand valiant men to Antioch: and they came to the king, and the king was very glad of their com- ing.
<br>45	And they that were of the city assembled themselves together, to the number of a hundred and twenty thousand men, and would have killed the king.
<br>46	And the king fled into the palace: and they of the city kept the passages of the city, and be- gan to fight.
<br>47	And the king called the Jews to his assis- tance: and they came to him all at once, and they all dispersed themselves through the city.
<br>48	And they slew in that day a hundred thou- sand men, and they set fire to the city, and got many spoils that day, and delivered the king.
<br>49	And they that were of the city saw that the Jews had got the city as they would: and they were discouraged in their mind, and cried to the king, making supplication, and saying
<br>50	Grant us peace, and let the Jews cease from assaulting us, and the city.
<br>51	And they threw down their arms, and made peace, and the Jews were glorified in the sight of the king, and in the sight of all that were in his realm, and were renowned throughout the
<br> 
<br>kingdom, and returned to Jerusalem with many spoils.
<br>52	So king Demetrius sat in the throne of his kingdom: and the land was quiet before him.
<br>53	And he falsified all whatsoever he had said, and alienated himself from Jonathan, and did not reward him according to the benefits he had received from him, but gave him great trouble.
<br>54	And after this Tryphon returned, and with him Antiochus, the young boy, who was made king, and put on the diadem.
<br>55	And there assembled unto him all the hands which Demetrius had sent away, and they fought against Demetrius who turned his back and fled.
<br>56	And Tryphon took the elephants, and made himself master of Antioch.
<br>57	And young Antiochus wrote to Jonathan, saying: I confirm thee in the high priesthood, and I appoint thee ruler over the four cities, and to be one of the king’s friends.
<br>58	And he sent him vessels of gold for his ser- vice, and he gave him leave to drink in gold, and to be clothed in purple, and to wear a golden buckle:
<br>59	And he made his brother, Simon, governor, from the borders of Tyre even to the confines of Egypt.
<br>60	Then Jonathan went forth, and passed through the cities beyond the river, and all the forces of Syria gathered themselves to him to help him, and he came to Ascalon, and they met him hononrably out of the city.
<br>61	And he went from thence to Gaza: and they that were in Gaza shut him out: and he be- sieged it, and burnt all the suburbs round about, and took the spoils.
<br>62	And the men of Gaza made supplication to Jonathan, and he gave them the right hand: and he took their sons for hostages, and sent them to
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Jerusalem: and he went through the country, as far as Damascus.
<br>63	And Jonathan heard that the generals of Demetrius were come treacherously to Cades, which is in Galilee, with a great army, purposing to remove him from the affairs of the kingdom.
<br>64	And he went against them: but left his brother, Simon, in the country.
<br>65	And Simon encamped against Bethsura, and assaulted it many days, and shut them up.
<br>66	And they desired him to make peace, and he granted it them: and he cast them out from thence, and took the city, and placed a garrison in it.
<br>67	And Jonathan and his army encamped by the water of Genesar, and before it was light they were ready in the plain of Asor.
<br>68	And behold the army of the strangers met him in the plain, and they laid an ambush for him in the mountains: but he went out against them.
<br>69	And they that lay in ambush rose out of their places, and joined battle.
<br>70	And all that were on Jonathan’s side fled, and none was left of them, but Mathathias, the son of Absalom, and Judas, the son of Calphi, chief captain of the army.
<br>71	And Jonathan rent his garments, and cast earth upon his head, and prayed.
<br>72	And Jonathan turned again to them to bat- tle, and he put them to flight, and they fought. 73 And they of his part that fled saw this, and
<br>they turned again to him, and they all with him
<br>pursued the enemies, even to Cades, to their own camp, and they came even thither.
<br>74 And there fell of the aliens in that day three thousand men: and Jonathan returned to Jern- salem.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 12
<br>And Jonathan saw that the time served him, and he chose certain men, and sent them to Rome, to confirm and to renew the amity with them:
<br>2	And he sent letters to the Spartans, and to other places, according to the same form.
<br>3	And they went to Rome, and entered into the senate house, and said: Jonathan, the high priest, and the nation of the Jews, have sent us to renew the amity, and alliance, as it was before. 4 And they gave them letters to their gover- nors in every place, to conduct them into the
<br>land of Juda with peace.
<br>5	And this is a copy of the letters which Jonathan wrote to the Spartans:
<br>6	Jonathan, the high priest, and the ancients of the nation, and the priests, and the rest of the people of the Jews, to the Spartans, their brethren, greeting.
<br>7	There were letters sent long ago to Onias the high priest, from Arius, who reigned then among you to signify that you are our brethren, as the copy here underwritten doth specify.
<br>8	And Onias received the ambassador with honour and received the letters, wherein there was mention made of the alliance, and amity.
<br>9	We, though we needed none of these things having for our comfort the holy books that are in our hands,
<br>10	Chose rather to send to you to renew the brotherhood and friendship, lest we should be- come stranger to you altogether: for there is a long time passed since you sent to us.
<br>11	We, therefore, at all times without ceasing, both in our festivals, and other days wherein it is convenient, remember you in the sacrifices that we offer, and in our observances, as it is meet and becoming to remember brethren.
<br>12	And we rejoice at yonr glory.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>13	But we have had many troubles and wars on every side; and the kings that are round about us have fought against us.
<br>14	But we would not be troublesome to you, nor to the rest of our allies and friends, in these wars.
<br>15	For we have had help from heaven, and we have been delivered, and our enemies are hum- bled.
<br>16	We have chosen, therefore, Numenius the son of Antiochus, and Antipater, the son of Ja- son, and have sent them to the Romans, to renew with them the former amity and alliance.
<br>17	And we have commanded them to go also to you, and salute you, and to deliver you our letters, concerning the renewing of our brother- hood.
<br>18	And now you shall do well to give us an answer hereto.
<br>19	And this is the copy of the letter which he had sent to Onias:
<br>20	Arius, king of the Spartans, to Onias, the high priest, greeting.
<br>21	It is found in writing concerning the Spar- tans, and the Jews, that they are brethren, and that they are of the stock of Abraham.
<br>22	And now since this is come to our knowl- edge, you do well to write to us of your prosper- ity.
<br>23	And we also have written back to you, That our cattle, and our possessions, are yours: and yours, ours. We, therefore, have commanded that these things should be told you.
<br>24	Now Jonathan heard that the generals of Demetrius were come again with a greater army than before to fight against him.
<br>25	So he went out from Jerusalem, and met them in the land of Amath: for he gave them no time to enter into his country.
<br> 
<br>26	And he sent spies into their camp, and they came back, and brought him word that they de- signed to come upon them in the night.
<br>27	And when the sun was set, Jonathan com- manded his men to watch, and to be in arms all night long ready to fight, and he set sentinels round about the camp.
<br>28	And the enemies heard that Jonathan and his men were ready for battle: and they were struck with fear and dread in their heart: and they kindled fires in their camp.
<br>29	But Jonathan, and they that were with him, knew it not till the morning: for they saw the lights burning.
<br>30	And Jonathan pursued after them, but overtook them not: for they had passed the river Eleutherus.
<br>31	And Jonathan turned upon the Arabi- ans, that are called Zabadeans: and he defeated them, and took the spoils of them.
<br>32	And he went forward, and came to Dam- ascus, and passed through all that country.
<br>33	Simon also went forth, and came as far as Ascalon, and the neighbouring fortresses, and he turned aside to Joppe, and took possession of it, 34 (For he heard that they designed to deliver the hold to them that took part with Demetrius)
<br>and he put a garrison there to keep it.
<br>35 And Jonathan came back, and called to- gether the ancients of the people; and he took a resolution with them to build fortresses in Judea, 36 And to build up walls in Jerusalem, and raise a mount between the castle and the city, to separate it from the city, that so it might have no communication, and that they might neither
<br>buy nor sell.
<br>37 And they came together to build up the city: for the wall that was upon the brook, to- wards the east, was broken down, and he re- paired that which is called Caphetetha:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>38	And Simon built Adiada in Sephela, and fortified it, and set up gates and bars.
<br>39	Now when Tryphon had conceived a design to make himself king of Asia and to take the crown, and to stretch out his hand against king Antiochus:
<br>40	Fearing lest Jonathan would not suffer him, but would fight against him: he sought to seize upon him, and to kill him. So he rose up and came to Bethsan.
<br>41	And Jonathan went out to meet him with forty thousand men chosen for battle, and came to Bethsan.
<br>42	Now when Tryphon saw that Jonathan came with a great army, he durst not stretch forth his hand against him.
<br>43	But received him with honour, and com- mended him to all his friends, and gave him presents: and he commanded his troops to obey him, as himself.
<br>44	And he said to Jonathan: Why hast thou troubled all the people, whereas we have no war? 45 Now, therefore, send them back to their own houses: and choose thee a few men that may be with thee, and come with me to Ptolemais, and I will deliver it to thee, and the rest of the strong holds, and the army, and all that have any charge, and I will return and go away: for
<br>this is the cause of my coming.
<br>46	And Jonathan believed him, and did as he said: and sent away his army, and they departed into the land of Juda:
<br>47	But he kept with him three thousand men: of whom he sent two thousand into Galilee, and one thousand went with him.
<br>48	Now as soon as Jonathan entered into Ptolemais, they of Ptolemais shut the gates of the city, and took him: and all them that came in with him they slew with the sword.
<br>49	Then Tryphon sent an army and horsemen
<br> 
<br>into Galilee, and into the great plain, to destroy all Jonathan’s company.
<br>50	But they, when they understood that Jonathan, and all that were with him, were taken and slain, encouraged one another, and went out ready for battle.
<br>51	Then they that had come after them, seeing that they stood for their lives, returned back.
<br>52	Whereupon they all came peaceably into the land of Juda and they bewailed Jonathan, and them that had been with him, exceedingly: and Israel mourned with great lamentation.
<br>53	Then all the heathens that were round about them, sought to destroy them. For they said:
<br>54	They have no prince, nor any to help them: now therefore, let us make war upon them, and take away the memory of them from amongst men.
<br>
<br>Chapter 13
<br>Now Simon heard that Tryphon was gathering together a very great army to invade the land of Juda, and to destroy it.
<br>2	And seeing that the people was in dread and in fear, he went up to Jerusalem, and assembled the people,
<br>3	And exhorted them, saying: You know what great battles I and my brethren, and the house of my father, have fought for the laws, and the sanctuary, and the distresses that we have seen: 4 By reason whereof all my brethren have lost
<br>their lives for Israel’s sake, and I am left alone.
<br>5	And now far be it from me to spare my life in any time of trouble: for I am not better than my brethren.
<br>6	I will avenge then my nation and the sanc- tuary, and our children, and wives: for all the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>heathens are gathered together to destroy us out of mere malice.
<br>7	And the spirit of the people was enkindled as soon as they heard these words:
<br>8	And they answered with a loud voice, saying: Thou art our leader in the place of Judas, and Jonathan, thy brother:
<br>9	Fight thou our battles, and we will do what- soever thou shalt say to us.
<br>10	So gathering together all the men of war, he made haste to finish all the walls of Jerusalem, and he fortified it round about.
<br>11	And he sent Jonathan, the son of Absa- lom, and with him a new army, into Joppe, and he cast out them that were in it, and himself remained there.
<br>12	And Tryphon removed from Ptolemais with a great army, to invade the land of Juda, and Jonathan was with him in custody.
<br>13	But Simon pitched in Addus, over against the plain.
<br>14	And when Tryphon understood that Si- mon was risen up in the place of his brother, Jonathan, and that he meant to join battle with him, he sent messengers to him,
<br>15	Saying: We have detained thy brother, Jonathan, for the money that he owed in the king’s account, by reason of the affairs which he had the management of.
<br>16	But now send a hundred talents of silver, and his two sons for hostages, that when he is set at liberty he may not revolt from us, and we will release him.
<br>17	Now Simon knew that he spoke deceitfully to him; nevertheless, he ordered the money and the children to be sent, lest he should bring upon himself a great hatred of the people of Israel, who might have said:
<br>18	Because he sent not the money and the children therefore is he lost.
<br> 
<br>19	So he sent the children and the hundred talents and he lied, and did not let Jonathan go. 20 And after this, Tryphon entered within the country, to destroy it: and they went about by the way that leadeth to Ador: and Simon and his army marched to every place whithersoever
<br>they went.
<br>21	And they that were in the castle, sent mes- sengers to Tryphon, that he should make haste to come through the desert, and send them vict- uals.
<br>22	And Tryphon made ready all his horse- men to come that night; but there fell a very great snow, and he came not into the country of Galaad.
<br>23	And when he approached to Bascama, he slew Jonathan and his sons there.
<br>24	And Tryphon returned, and went into his own country.
<br>25	And Simon sent, and   took   the   bones of Jonathan, his brother, and buried them in Modin, the city of his fathers.
<br>26	And all Israel bewailed him with great lamentation: and they mourned for him many days.
<br>27	And Simon built over the sepulchre of his father and of his brethren, a building lofty to the sight, of polished stone, behind and before:
<br>28	And he set up seven pyramids, one against another, for his father, and his mother, and his four brethren:
<br>29	And round about these he set great pillars; and upon the pillars, arms, for a perpetual mem- ory; and by the arms, ships carved, which might be seen by all that sailed on the sea.
<br>30	This is the sepulchre that he made in Modin, even unto this day.
<br>31	But Tryphon, when he was upon a journey with the young king, Antiochus, treacherously slew him.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>32	And he reigned in his place, and put on the crown of Asia: and brought great evils upon the land.
<br>33	And Simon built up the strong holds of Judea, fortifying them with high towers, and great walls, and gates and bars: and he stored up victuals in the fortresses.
<br>34	And Simon chose men, and sent to king Demetrius, to the end that he should grant an immunity to the land; for all that Tryphon did, was to spoil.
<br>35	And king Demetrius, in answer to this re- quest, wrote a letter in this manner:
<br>36	King Demetrius to Simon, the high priest, and friend of kings, and to the ancients, and to the nation of the Jews, greeting:
<br>37	The golden crown, and the palm, which you sent, we have received: and we are ready to make a firm peace with you, and to write to the king’s chief officers to release you the things that we have released.
<br>38	For all that we have decreed in your favour shall stand in force. The strong holds that you have built, shall be your own.
<br>39	And as for any oversight or fault committed unto this day, we forgive it: and the crown which you owed: and if any other thing were taxed in Jerusalem, now let it not be taxed.
<br>40	And if any of you be fit to be enrolled among ours, let them be enrolled, and let there be peace between us.
<br>41	In the year one hundred and seventy, the yoke of the Gentiles was taken off from Israel.
<br>42	And the people of Israel began to write in the instruments, and public records, The first year under Simon, the high priest, the great cap- tain, and prince of the Jews.
<br>43	In those days Simon besieged Gaza, and camped round about it, and he made engines, and set them to the city, and he struck one tower,
<br> 
<br>and took it.
<br>44	And they that were within the engine leapt into the city: and there was a great uproar in the city.
<br>45	And they that were in the city went up, with their wives and children, upon the wall, with their garments rent, and they cried with a loud voice, beseeching Simon to grant them peace.
<br>46	And they said: Deal not with us according to our evil deeds, but according to thy mercy.
<br>47	And Simon being moved, did not destroy them but yet he cast them out of the city, and cleansed the houses wherein there had been idols, and then he entered into it with hymns, blessing the Lord:
<br>48	And having cast out of it all uncleanness, he placed in it men that should observe the law: and he fortified it, and made it his habitation.
<br>49	But they that were in the castle of Jerusalem were hindered from going out and coming into the country, and from buying and selling: and they were straitened with hunger, and many of them perished through famine.
<br>50	And they cried to Simon for peace, and he granted it to them: and he cast them out from thence and cleansed the castle from un- cleannesses.
<br>51	And they entered into it the three and twentieth day of the second month, in the year one hundred and seventy-one, with thanksgiv- ing, and branches of palm trees, and harps, and cymbals, and psalteries, and hymns, and canti- cles, because the great enemy was destroyed out of Israel.
<br>52	And he ordained that these days should be kept every year with gladness.
<br>53	And he fortified the mountain of the tem- ple that was near the castle, and he dwelt there himself, and they that were with him.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>54	And Simon saw that John, his son, was a valiant man for war: and he made him captain of all the forces: and he dwelt in Gazara.
<br>
<br>Chapter 14
<br>In the year one hundred and seventy-two king Demetrius assembled his army, and went into Media to get him succours to fight against Tryphon.
<br>2	And Arsaces, the king of Persia and Media, heard that Demetrius was entered within his bor- ders, and he sent one of his princes to take him alive, and bring him to him.
<br>3	And he went, and defeated the army of Demetrius: and took him, and brought him to Arsaces, and he put him into custody.
<br>4	And all the land of Juda was at rest all the days of Simon, and he sought the good of his na- tion: and his power, and his glory pleased them well all his days.
<br>5	And with all his glory he took Joppe for a haven, and made an entrance to the isles of the sea.
<br>6	And he enlarged the bounds of his nation, and made himself master of the country.
<br>7	And he gathered together a great number of captives, and had the dominion of Gazara, and of Bethsura, and of the castle: and took away all uncleanness out of it, and there was none that resisted him.
<br>8	And every man tilled his land with peace, and the land of Juda yielded her increase, and the trees of the fields their fruit.
<br>9	The ancient men sat all in the streets, and treated together of the good things of the land, and the youug men put on them glory, and the robes of war.
<br>10	And he provided victuals for the cities, and
<br> 
<br>he appointed that they should be furnished with ammunition, so that the fame of his glory was renowned even to the end of the earth.
<br>11	He made peace in the land, and Israel re- joiced with great joy.
<br>12	And every man sat under his vine, and under his fig tree: and there was none to make them afraid.
<br>13	There was none left in the land to fight against them: kings were discomfited in those days.
<br>14	And he strengthened all those of his people that were brought low, and he sought the law, and took away every unjust and wicked man.
<br>15	He glorified the sanctuary, and multiplied the vessels of the holy places.
<br>16	And it was heard at Rome, and as far as Sparta, that Jonathan was dead: and they were very sorry.
<br>17	But when they heard that Simon, his brother, was made high priest in his place, and was possessed of all the country, and the cities therein:
<br>18	They wrote to him in tables of brass, to renew the friendship and alliance which they had made with Judas and with Jonathan, his brethren.
<br>19	And they were read before the assembly in Jerusalem. And this is the copy of the letters that the Spartans sent.
<br>20	The princes and the cities of the Spartans, to Simon, the high priest, and to the ancients, and the priests, and the rest of the people of the Jews, their brethren, greeting.
<br>21	The ambassadors that were sent to our peo- ple, have told us of your glory, and honour, and joy: and we rejoiced at their coming.
<br>22	And we registered what was said by them in the councils of the people, in this manner: Numenius, the son of Antiochus, and Antipater,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>the son of Jason, ambassadors of the Jews, came to us to renew the former friendship with us.
<br>23	And it pleased the people to receive the men honourably, and to put a copy of their words in the public records, to be a memorial to the people of the Spartans. And we have written a copy of them to Simon, the high priest.
<br>24	And after this Simon sent Numenius to Rome, with a great shield of gold, of the weight of a thousand pounds, to confirm the league with them. And when the people of Rome had heard 25 These words, they said: What thanks shall
<br>we give to Simon, and his sons:
<br>26	For he hath restored his brethren, and hath driven away in fight the enemies of Israel from them: and they decreed him liberty, and regis- tered it in tables of brass, and set it upon pillars in mount Sion.
<br>27	And this is a copy of the writing. The eighteenth day of the month Elul, in the year one hundred and seventy-two, being the third year under Simon, the high priest, at Asaramel, 28 In a great assembly of the priests, and of the people, and the princes of the nation, and the ancients of the country, these things were noti- fied: Forasmuch as there have often been wars
<br>in our country,
<br>29	And Simon, the son of Mathathias, of the children of Jarib, and his brethren, have put themselves in danger, and resisted the enemies of their nation, for the maintenance of their holy places, and the law: and have raised their nation to great glory.
<br>30	And Jonathan gathered together his na- tion, and was made their high priest, and he was laid to his people.
<br>31	And their enemies desired to tread down and destroy their country, and to stretch forth their hands against their holy places.
<br>32	Then Simon resisted and fought for his na-
<br> 
<br>tion, and laid out much of his money, and armed the valiant men of his nation, and gave them wages.
<br>33	And he fortified the cities of Judea and Bethsura that lieth in the borders of Judea, where the armour of the enemies was before: and he placed there a garrison of Jews.
<br>34	And he fortified Joppe, which lieth by the sea: and Gazara, which bordereth upon Azotus, wherein the enemies dwelt before, and he placed Jews here: and furnished them with all things convenient for their reparation.
<br>35	And the people seeing the acts of Simon, and to what glory he meant to bring his nation, made him their prince and high priest, because he had done all these things, and for the jus- tice and faith which he kept to his nation, and for that he sought by all means to advance his people.
<br>36	And in his days things prospered in his hands, so that the heathens were taken away out of their country, and they also that were in the city of David, in Jerusalem, in the castle, out of which they issued forth, and profaned all places round about the sanctuary, and did much evil to purity.
<br>37	And he placed therein Jews for the defence of the country, and of the city, and he raised up the walls of Jerusalem.
<br>38	And king Demetrius confirmed him in the high priesthood.
<br>39	According to these things he made him his friend, and glorified him with great glory.
<br>40	For he had heard that the Romans had called the Jews their friends, and confederates, and brethren, and that they had received Si- mon’s ambassadors with honour:
<br>41	And that the Jews, and their priests, had consented that he should be their prince and high priest for ever, till there should arise a faith-
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>ful prophet:
<br>42	And that he should be chief over them, and that he should have the charge of the sanc- tuary, and that he should appoint rulers over their works, and over the country, and over the armour, and over the strong holds;
<br>43	And that he should have care of the holy places; and that he should be obeyed by all, and that all the writings in the country should be made in his name; and that he should be clothed with purple and gold:
<br>44	And that it should not be lawful for any of the people, or of the priests, to disannul any of these things, or to gainsay his words, or to call together an assembly in the country without him: or to be clothed with purple, or to wear a buckle of gold.
<br>45	And whosoever shall do otherwise, or shall make void any of these things, shall be punished. 46 And it pleased all the people to establish
<br>Simon, and to do according to these words.
<br>47	And Simon accepted thereof, and was well pleased to execute the office of the high priest- hood, and to be captain, and prince of the nation of the Jews, and of the priests, and to be chief over all.
<br>48	And they commanded that this writing should be put in tables of brass, and that they should be set up within the compass of the sanc- tuary, in a conspicuous place:
<br>49	And that a copy thereof should be put in the treasury, that Simon, and his sons, may have it.
<br>
<br>Chapter 15
<br>And king Antiochus, the son of Demetrius, sent letters from the isles of the sea to Simon, the priest, and prince of the nation of the Jews, and
<br> 
<br>to all the people:
<br>2	And the contents were these: King Anti- ochus to Simon, the high priest, and to the na- tion of the Jews, greeting.
<br>3	Forasmuch as certain pestilent men have usurped the kingdom of our fathers, and my pur- pose is to challenge the kingdom, and to restore it to its former estate; and I have chosen a great army, and have built ships of war.
<br>4	And I design to go through the country, that I may take revenge of them that have destroyed our country, and that have made many cities des- olate in my realm.
<br>5	Now, therefore, I confirm unto thee all the oblations which all the kings before me remitted to thee, and what other gifts soever they remit- ted to thee:
<br>6	And I give thee leave to coin thy own money in thy country:
<br>7	And let Jerusalem be holy and free, and all the armour that hath been made, and the fortresses which thou hast built, and which thou keepest in thy hands, let them remain to thee.
<br>8	And all that is due to the king, and what should be the king’s hereafter, from this present and for ever, is forgiven thee.
<br>9	And when we shall have recovered our king- dom, we will glorify thee, and thy nation, and the temple, with great glory, so that your glory shall be made manifest in all the earth.
<br>10	In the year one hundred and seventy-four, Antiochus entered into the land of his fathers, and all the forces assembled to him, so that few were left with Tryphon.
<br>11	And king Antiochus pursued after him, and he fled along by the sea coast and came to Dora. 12 For he perceived that evils were gathered together upon him, and his troops had forsaken
<br>him.
<br>13 And Antiochus camped above Dora with a
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>hundred and twenty thousand men of war, and eight thousand horsemen:
<br>14	And he invested the city, and the ships drew near by sea: and they annoyed the city by land, and by sea, and suffered none to come in, or to go out.
<br>15	And Numenius, and they that had been with him, came from the city of Rome, having letters written to the kings, and countries, the contents whereof were these:
<br>16	Lucius, the consul of the Romans, to king Ptolemee, greeting.
<br>17	The ambassadors of the Jews, our friends, came to us, to renew the former friendship and alliance, being sent from Simon, the high priest, and the people of the Jews.
<br>18	And they brought also a shield of gold of a thousand pounds.
<br>19	It hath seemed good therefore to us, to write to the kings and countries, that they should do them no harm, nor fight against them, their cities, or countries: and that they should give no aid to them that fight against them.
<br>20	And it hath seemed good to us to receive the shield of them.
<br>21	If, therefore, any pestilent men are fled out of their country to you, deliver them to Simon, the high priest, that he may punish them accord- ing to their law.
<br>22	These same things were written to king Demetrius, and to Attalus, and to Ariarathes, and to Arsaces,
<br>23	And to all the countries: and to Lamp- sacus and to the Spartans, and to Delus, and Myndus, and Sicyon, and Caria, and Samus, and Pamphylia, and Lycia, and Alicarnassus, and Cos, and Side, and Aradus, and Rhodes, and Phaselis, and Gortyna, and Gnidus, and Cyprus, and Cyrene.
<br> 
<br>24	And they wrote a copy thereof to Simon, the high priest, and to the people of the Jews.
<br>25	But king Antiochus moved his camp to Dora the second time, assaulting it continually, and making engines: and he shut up Tryphon, that he could not go out.
<br>26	And Simon sent to him two thousand cho- sen men to aid him, silver also, and gold, and abundance of furniture.
<br>27	And he would not receive them, but broke all the covenant that he had made with him be- fore, and alienated himself from him.
<br>28	And he sent to him Athenobius, one of his friends, to treat with him, saying: You hold Joppe and Gazara, and the castle that is in Jerusalem, which are cities of my kingdom:
<br>29	Their borders you have wasted, and you have made great havoc in the land, and have got the dominion of many places in my kingdom.
<br>30	Now, therefore, deliver up the cities that you have taken, and the tributes of the places whereof you have gotten the dominion without the borders of Judea.
<br>31	But if not, give me for them five hundred talents of silver, and for the havoc that you have made, and the tributes of the cities, other five hundred talents: or else we will come and fight against you.
<br>32	So Athenobius, the king’s friend came to Jerusalem, and saw the glory of Simon and his magnificence in gold, and silver, and his great equipage, and he was astonished, and told him the king’s words.
<br>33	And Simon answered him, and said to him: We have neither taken other men’s land, neither do we hold that which is other men’s, but the inheritance of our fathers, which was for some time unjustly possessed by our enemies.
<br>34	But we having opportunity, claim the in- heritance of our fathers.

<br> 
<br>35	And as to thy complaints concerning Joppe and Gazara, they did great harm to the people, and to our country: yet for these we will give a hundred talents. And Athenobius answered him not a word.
<br>36	But returning in a rage to the king, made report to him of these words, and of the glory of Simon, and of all that he had seen, and the king was exceeding angry.
<br>37	And Tryphon fled away by ship to Or- thosias.
<br>38	And the king appointed Cendebeus cap- tain of the sea coast, and gave him an army of footmen and horsemen.
<br>39	And he commanded him to march with his army towards Judea: and he commanded him to build up Gedor, and to fortify the gates of the city, and to war against the people. But the king himself pursued after Tryphon.
<br>40	And Cendebeus came to Jamnia, and be- gan to provoke the people, and to ravage Judea, and to take the people prisoners, and to kill, and to build Gedor.
<br>41	And he placed there horsemen, and an army: that they might issue forth, and make incursions upon the ways of Judea, as the king had commanded him.
<br>
<br>Chapter 16
<br>Then John came up from Gazara, and told Simon, his father, what Cendebeus had done against their people.
<br>2	And Simon called his two eldest sons, Judas and John, and said to them: I and my brethren, and my father’s house, have fought against the enemies of Israel from our youth even to this day: and things have prospered so well in our hands, that we have delivered Israel oftentimes.
<br> 
<br>3	And now I am old, but be you instead of me, and my brethren, and go out, and fight for our nation: and the help from heaven be with you.
<br>4	Then he chose out of the country twenty thousand fighting men, and horsemen, and they went forth against Cendebeus: and they rested in Modin.
<br>5	And they arose in the morning, and went into the plain: and behold a very great army of footmen and horsemen came against them, and there was a running river between them.
<br>6	And he and his people pitched their camp over against them, and he saw that the people were afraid to go over the river, so he went over first: then the men seeing him, passed over after him.
<br>7	And he divided the people, and set the horsemen in the midst of the footmen: but the horsemen of the enemies were very numerous.
<br>8	And they sounded the holy trumpets: and Cendebeus and his army were put to flight: and there fell many of them wounded, and the rest fled into the strong hold.
<br>9	At that time, Judas, John’s brother, was wounded: but John pursued after them, till he came to Cedron, which he had built:
<br>10	And they fled even to the towers that were in the fields of Azotus, and he burnt them with fire. And there fell of them two thousand men, and he returned into Judea in peace.
<br>11	Now Ptolemee, the son of Abobus, was ap- pointed captain in the plain of Jericho, and he had abundance of silver and gold.
<br>12	For he was son in law of the high priest.
<br>13	And his heart was lifted up, and he de- signed to make himself master of the country, and he purposed treachery against Simon and his sons, to destroy them.
<br>14	Now Simon, as he was going through the cities that were in the country of Judea, and
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>taking care for the good ordering of them, went down to Jericho, he and Mathathias and Judas, his sons, in the year one hundred and seventy- seven, the eleventh month: the same is the month Sabath.
<br>15	And the son of Abobus received them de- ceitfully into a little fortress, that is called Doch, which he had built: and he made them a great feast, and hid men there.
<br>16	And when Simon and his sons had drunk plentifully, Ptolemee and his men rose up, and took their weapons, and entered into the ban- queting place, and slew him, and his two sons, and some of his servants.
<br>17	And he committed a great treachery in Is- rael, and rendered evil for good.
<br>18	And Ptolemee wrote these things, and sent to the king that he should send him an army to aid him, and he would deliver him the country, and their cities, and tributes.
<br>19	And he sent others to Gazara to kill John: and to the tribunes he sent letters to come to him, and that he would give them silver, and gold, and gifts.
<br>20	And he sent others to take Jerusalem, and the mountain of the temple.
<br>21	Now one running before, told John in Gazara, that his father and his brethren were slain, and that he hath sent men to kill thee also. 22 But when he heard it, he was exceedingly afraid: and he apprehended the men that came to kill him, and he put them to death: for he
<br>knew that they sought to make him away.
<br>23	And as concerning the rest of the acts of John, and his wars, and the worthy deeds, which he bravely achieved, and the building of the walls, which he made, and the things that he did:
<br>24	Behold, these are written in the book of the days of his priesthood, from the time that
<br> 
<br>he was made high priest after his father.

<br>Chapter 1
<br>To the brethren, the Jews that are through- out Egypt; the brethren, the Jews that are in Jerusalem, and in the land of Judea, send health and good peace.
<br>2 May God be gracious to you, and remember his covenant that he made with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, his faithful servants:
<br>3 And give you all a heart to worship him, and to do his will with a great heart, and a willing mind.
<br>4 May he open your heart in his law, and in his commandments, and send you peace.
<br>5 May he hear your prayers, and be reconciled unto you, and never forsake you in the evil time.
<br>6	And now here we are praying for you.
<br>7	When Demetrius reigned, in the year one hundred and sixty-nine, we Jews wrote to you in the trouble and violence that came upon us in those years, after Jason withdrew himself from the holy land, and from the kingdom.
<br>8	They burnt the gate, and shed innocent blood: then we prayed to the Lord, and were heard, and we offered sacrifices, and fine flour, and lighted the lamps, and set forth the loaves. 9 And now celebrate ye the days of Scenopegia
<br>in the month of Casleu.
<br>10	In the year one hundred and eighty-eight, the people that is at Jerusalem, and in Judea, and the senate, and Judas, to Aristobolus, the preceptor of king Ptolemee, who is of the stock
<br> 
<br>
<br>of the anointed priests, and to the Jews that are in Egypt, health and welfare.
<br>11	Having been delivered by God out of great dangers, we give him great thanks, forasmuch as we have been in war with such a king.
<br>12	For he made numbers of men swarm out of Persia, that have fought against us, and the holy city.
<br>13	For when the leader himself was in Persia, and with him a very great army, he fell in the temple of Nanea, being deceived by the counsel of the priests of Nanea.
<br>14	For Antiochus, with his friends, came to the place as though he would marry her, and that he might receive great sums of money under the title of a dowry.
<br>15	And when the priests of Nanea had set it forth, and he with a small company had entered into the compass of the temple, they shut the temple,
<br>16	When Antiochus was come in: and opening a secret entrance of the temple, they cast stones and slew the leader, and them that were with him, and hewed them in pieces; and cutting off their heads, they threw them forth.
<br>17	Blessed be God in all things, who hath de- livered up the wicked.
<br>18	Therefore, whereas we purpose to keep the purification of the temple on the five and twen- tieth day of the month of Casleu, we thought it necessary to signify it to you: that you also may keep the day of Scenopegia, and the day of the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>fire, that was given when Nehemias offered sac- rifice, after the temple and the altar was built.
<br>19	For when our fathers were led into Persia, the priests that then were worshippers of God, took privately the fire from the altar, and hid it in a valley where there was a deep pit without water, and there they kept it safe, so that the place was unknown to all men.
<br>20	But when many years had passed, and it pleased God that Nehemias should be sent by the king of Persia, he sent some of the posterity of those priests that had hid it, to seek for the fire: and as they told us, they found no fire, but thick water.
<br>21	Then he bade them draw it up, and bring it to him: and the priest, Nehemias, commanded the sacrifices that were laid on, to be sprinkled with the same water, both the wood, and the things that were laid upon it.
<br>22	And when this was done, and the time came that the sun shone out, which before was in a cloud, there was a great fire kindled, so that all wondered.
<br>23	And all the priests made prayer, while the sacrifice was consuming, Jonathan beginning, and the rest answering.
<br>24	And the prayer of Nehemias was after this manner: O Lord God, Creator of all things, dreadful and strong, just and merciful, who alone art the good king,
<br>25	Who alone art gracious, who alone art just, and almighty, and eternal, who deliverest Israel from all evil, who didst choose the fathers, and didst sanctify them:
<br>26	Receive the sacrifice for all thy people Is- rael, and preserve thy own portion, and sanctify it.
<br>27	Gather together our scattered people, de- liver them that are slaves to the Gentiles, and look upon them that are despised and abhorred:
<br> 
<br>that the Gentiles may know that thou art our God
<br>28	Punish them that oppress us, and that treat us injuriously with pride.
<br>29	Establish thy people in thy holy place, as Moses hath spoken.
<br>30	And the priests sung hymns till the sacrifice was consumed.
<br>32	Which being done, there was kindled a flame from them: but it was consumed by the light that shined from the altar.
<br>33	And when this matter became public, it was told to the king of Persia, that in the place where the priests that were led away, had hid the fire, there appeared water, with which Nehemias and they that were with him had purified the sacrifices.
<br>34	And the king considering, and diligently examining the matter, made a temple for it, that he might prove what had happened.
<br>35	And when he had proved it, he gave the priests many goods, and divers presents, and he took and distributed them to them with his own hand.
<br>36	And Nehemias called this place Nephthar, which is interpreted purification. But many call it Nephi.
<br>
<br>Chapter 2
<br>Now it is found in the descriptions of Jeremias, the prophet, that he commanded them that went into captivity, to take the fire, as it hath been signified, and how he gave charge to them that were carried away into captivity.
<br>2	And how he gave them the law, that they should not forget the commandments of the Lord, and that they should not err in their minds, seeing the idols of gold, and silver, and
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>the ornaments of them.
<br>3	And with other such like speeches, he ex- horted them that they would not remove the law from their heart.
<br>4	It was also contained in the same writing, how the prophet, being warned by God, com- manded that the tabernacle and the ark should accompany him, till he came forth to the moun- tain where Moses went up, and saw the inheri- tance of God.
<br>5	And when Jeremias came thither he found a hollow cave: and he carried in thither the taber- nacle, and the ark, and the altar of incense, and so stopped the door.
<br>7	And when Jeremias perceived it, he blamed them, saying: The place shall be unknown, till God gather together the congregation of the peo- ple, and receive them to mercy.
<br>8	And then the Lord will shew these things, and the majesty of the Lord shall appear, and there shall be a cloud as it was also shewed to Moses, and he shewed it when Solomon prayed that the place might be sanctified to the great God.
<br>9	For he treated wisdom in a magnificent man- ner: and like a wise man, he offered the sacrifice of thc dedication, and of the finishing of the tem- ple.
<br>10	And as Moses prayed to the Lord, and fire came down from heaven, and consumed the holo- caust: so Solomon also prayed, and fire came down from heaven and consumed the holocaust. 11 And Moses said: Because the sin offering
<br>was not eaten, it was consumed.
<br>12	So Solomon also celebrated the dedication eight days.
<br>13	And these same things were set down in the memoirs, and commentaries of Nehemias: and how he made a library, and gathered together out of the countries, the books both of the prophets,
<br> 
<br>and of David, and the epistles of the kings, and concerning the holy gifts.
<br>14	And in like manner Judas also gathered together all such things as were lost by the war we had, and they are in our possession.
<br>15	Wherefore, if you want these things, send some that may fetch them to you.
<br>16	As we are then about to celebrate the pu- rification, we have written unto you: and you shall do well, if you keep the same days.
<br>17	And we hope that God, who hath delivered his people, and hath rendered to all the inheri- tance, and the kingdom, and the priesthood, and the sanctuary,
<br>18	As he promised in the law, will shortly have mercy upon us, and will gather us together from every land under heaven into the holy place.
<br>19	For he hath delivered us out of great perils, and hath cleansed the place.
<br>20	Now as concerning Judas Machabeus, and his brethren, and the purification of the great temple, and the dedication of the altar:
<br>21	As also the wars against Antiochus, the Illustrious, and his son, Eupator:
<br>22	And the manifestations that came from heaven to them, that behaved themselves man- fully on the behalf of the Jews, so that, being but a few they made themselves masters of the whole country, and put to flight the barbarous multitude:
<br>23	And recovered again thc most renowned temple in all the world, and delivered the city, and restored the laws that were abolished, the Lord with all clemency shewing mercy to them. 24 And all such things as have been comprised in five books by Jason, of Cyrene, we have at-
<br>tempted to abridge in one book.
<br>25 For considering the multitude of books, and the difficulty that they find that desire to under- take the narrations of histories, because of the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>multitude of the matter,
<br>26	We have taken care for those indeed that are willing to read, that it might be a pleasure of mind: and for the studious, that they may more easily commit to memory: and that all that read might receive profit.
<br>27	And as to ourselves indeed, in undertaking this work of abridging, we have taken in hand no easy task; yea, rather a business full of watching and sweat.
<br>28	But as they that prepare a feast, and seek to satisfy the will of others: for the sake of many, we willingly undergo the labour.
<br>29	Leaving to the authors the exact handling of every particular, and as for ourselves, accord- ing to the plan proposed, studying to be brief.
<br>30	For as the master builder of a new house must have care of the whole building: but he that taketh care to paint it, must seek out fit things for the adorning of it: so must it be judged of us.
<br>31	For to collect all that is to be known, to put the discourse in order, and curiously to discuss every particular point, is the duty of the author of a history:
<br>32	But to pursue brevity of speech, and to avoid nice declarations of things, is to be granted to him that maketh an abridgment.
<br>33	Here then we will begin the narration: let this be enough by way of a preface: for it is a foolish thing to make a long prologue, and to be short in the story itself.
<br>
<br>Chapter 3
<br>Therefore, when the holy city was inhabited with all peace, and the laws as yet were very well kept, because of the godliness of Onias, the high priest and the hatred his soul had of evil,
<br> 
<br>2	It came to pass that even the kings them- selves and the princes esteemed the place worthy of the highest honour, and glorified the temple with very great gifts:
<br>3	So that Seleucus, king of Asia, allowed out of his revenues all the charges belonging to the ministry of the sacrifices.
<br>4	But one Simon, of the tribe of Benjamin, who was appointed overseer of the temple, strove in opposition to the high priest, to bring about some unjust thing in the city.
<br>5	And when he could not overcome Onias, he went to Apollonius, the son of Tharseas, who at that time was governor of Celesyria, and Pheni- cia:
<br>6	And told him, that the treasury in Jerusalem was full of immense sums of money, and the com- mon store was infinite, which did not belong to the account of the sacrifices: and that it was possible to bring all into the king’s hands.
<br>7	Now when Apollonius had given the king notice concerning the money that he was told of, he called for Heliodorus, who had the charge over his affairs, and sent him with commission to bring him the foresaid money.
<br>8	So Heliodorus forthwith began his journey, under a colour of visiting the cities of Celesyria and Phenicia, but indeed to fulfil the king’s pur- pose.
<br>9	And when he was come to Jerusalem, and had been courteously received in the city by the high priest, he told him what information had been given concerning the money: and declared the cause for which he was come: and asked if these things were so indeed.
<br>10	Then the high priest told him that these were sums deposited, and provisions for the sub- sistence of the widows and the fatherless:
<br>11	And that some part of that which wicked Simon had given intelligence of belonged to Hir-
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>canus, son of Tobias, a man of great dignity; and that the whole was four hundred talents of silver, and two hundred of gold.
<br>12	But that to deceive them who had trusted to the place and temple which is honoured throughout the whole world, for the reverence and holiness of it, was a thing which could not by any means be done.
<br>13	But he, by reason of the orders he had re- ceived from the king, said, that by all means the money must be carried to the king.
<br>14	So on the day he had appointed, Heliodorus entered in to order this matter. But there was no small terror throughout the whole city.
<br>15	And the priests prostrated themselves be- fore the altar in their priests’ vestments, and called upon him from heaven, who made the law concerning things given to be kept, that he would preserve them safe, for them that had deposited them.
<br>16	Now whosoever saw the countenance of the high priest, was wounded in heart: for his face, and the changing of his colour, declared the in- ward sorrow of his mind.
<br>17	For the man was so compassed with sadness and horror of the body, that it was manifest to them that beheld him, what sorrow he had in his heart.
<br>18	Others also came flocking together out of their houses, praying and making public suppli- cation, because the place was like to come into contempt.
<br>19	And the women, girded with haircloth about their breasts, came together in the streets. And the virgins also that were shut up, came forth, some to Onias, and some to the walls, and others looked out of the windows.
<br>20	And all holding up their hands towards heaven made supplication.
<br>21	For the expectation of the mixed multi-
<br> 
<br>tude, and of the high priest, who was in an agony, would have moved any one to pity.
<br>22	And these indeed called upon almighty God, to preserve the things that had been com- mitted to them safe and sure for those that had committed them.
<br>23	But Heliodorus executed that which he had resolved on, himself being present in the same place with his guard about the treasury.
<br>24	But the spirit of the Almighty God gave a great evidence of his presence, so that all that had presumed to obey him, falling down by the power of God, were struck with fainting and dread.
<br>25	For there appeared to them a horse, with a terrible rider upon him, adorned with a very rich covering: and he ran fiercely and struck He- liodorus with his fore feet, and he that sat upon him seemed to have armour of gold.
<br>26	Moreover there appeared two other young men, beautiful and strong, bright and glorious, and in comely apparel: who stood by him, on either side, and scourged him without ceasing with many stripes.
<br>27	And Heliodorus suddenly fell to the ground, and they took him up, covered with great darkness, and having put him into a lit- ter, they carried him out.
<br>28	So he that came with many servants, and all his guard, into the aforesaid treasury, was carried out, no one being able to help him, the manifest power of God being known.
<br>29	And he indeed, by the power of God, lay speechless, and without all hope of recovery.
<br>30	But they praised the Lord, because he had glorified his place: and the temple, that a lit- tle before was full of fear and trouble, when the Almighty Lord appeared, was filled with joy and gladness.
<br>31	Then some of the friends of Heliodorus
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>forthwith begged of Onias, that he would call upon the Most High to grant him his life, who was ready to give up the ghost.
<br>32	So the high priest, considering that the king might perhaps suspect that some mischief had been done to Heliodorus by the Jews, offered a sacrifice of health for the recovery of the man.
<br>33	And when the high priest was praying, the same young men in the same clothing stood by Heliodorus, and said to him: Give thanks to Onias the priest: because for his sake the Lord hath granted thee life.
<br>34	And thou having been scourged by God, declare unto all men the great works and the power of God. And having spoken thus, they appeared no more.
<br>35	So Heliodorus, after he had offered a sac- rifice to God, and made great vows to him, that had granted him life, and given thanks to Onias, taking his troops with him, returned to the king.
<br>36	And he testified to all men the works of the great God, which he had seen with his own eyes.
<br>37	And when the king asked Heliodorus, who might be a fit man to be sent yet once more to Jerusalem, he said:
<br>38	If thou hast any enemy, or traitor to thy king dom, send him thither, and thou shalt re- ceive him again scourged, if so be he escape: for there is undoubtedly in that place a certain power of God.
<br>39	For he that hath his dwelling in the heav- ens, is the visiter and protector of that place, and he striketh and destroyeth them that come to do evil to it.
<br>40	And the things concerning Heliodorus, and the keeping of thc treasury, fell out in this man- ner
<br> 
<br>Chapter 4
<br>But Simon, of whom we spoke before, who was the betrayer of the money, and of his country, spoke ill of Onias, as though he had incited He- liodorus to do these things, and had been the promoter of evils:
<br>2	And he presumed to call him a traitor to the kingdom, who provided for the city, and de- fended his nation, and was zealous for the law of God.
<br>3	But when the enmities proceeded so far, that murders also were committed by some of Simon’s friends:
<br>4	Onias, considering the danger of this con- tention, and that Apollonius, who was the gov- ernor of Celesyia, and Phenicia, was outrageous, which increased the malice of Simon, went to the king,
<br>5	Not to be an accuser of his countrymen, but with view to the common good of all the people. 6 For he saw that, except the king took care, it was impossible that matters should be settled in peace, or that Simon would cease from his folly. 7 But after the death of Seleucus, when Anti- ochus, who was called the Illustrious, had taken possession of the kingdom, Jason, the brother of
<br>Onias, ambitiously sought the high priesthood:
<br>8	And went to the king, promising him three hundred and sixty talents of silver, and out of other revenues fourscore talents.
<br>9	Besides this he promised also a hundred and fifty more, if he might have license to set him up a place for exercise, and a place for youth, and to entitle them that were at Jerusalem, An- tiochians.
<br>10	Which when the king had granted, and he had gotten the rule into his hands, forthwith he began to bring over his countrymen to the fash- ion of the heathens.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>11	And abolishing those things, which had been decreed of special favour by the kings in behalf of the Jews, by the means of John, the father of that Eupolemus, who went ambassador to Rome to make amity and alliance, he disan- nulled the lawful ordinances of the citizens, and brought in fashions that were perverse.
<br>12	For he had the boldness to set up, under the very castle, a place of exercise, and to put all the choicest youths in brothel houses.
<br>13	Now this was not the beginning, but an increase, and progress of heathenish and foreign manners, through the abominable and unheard of wickedness of Jason, that impious wretch, and no priest.
<br>14	Insomuch that the priests were not now occupied about the offices of the altar, but de- spising the temple and neglecting the sacrifices, hastened to be partakers of the games, and of the unlawful allowance thereof, and of the exercise of the discus.
<br>15	And setting nought by the honours of their fathers, they esteemed the Grecian glories for the best:
<br>16	For the sake of which they incurred a dan- gerous contention, and followed earnestly their ordinances, and in all things they coveted to be like them, who were their enemies and murder- ers.
<br>17	For acting wickedly against the laws of God doth not pass unpunished: but this the time fol- lowing will declare.
<br>18	Now when the game that was used ev- ery fifth year was kept at Tyre, the king being present,
<br>19	The wicked Jason sent from Jerusalem sin- ful men, to carry three hundred didrachmas of silver for the sacrifice of Hercules; but the bear- ers thereof desired it might not be bestowed on the sacrifices, because it was not necessary, but
<br> 
<br>might be deputed for other charges.
<br>20	So the money was appointed by him that sent it to the sacrifice of Hercules: but because of them that carried it was employed for thc making of galleys.
<br>21	Now when Apollonius, the son of Mnes- theus was sent into Egypt to treat with the no- bles of king Philometor, and Antiochus under- stood that he was wholly excluded from the af- fairs of the kingdom, consulting his own interest, he departed thence and came to Joppe, and from thence to Jerusalem.
<br>22	Where he was received in a magnificent manner by Jason, and the city, and came in with torch lights, and with praises, and from thence he returned with his army into Phenicia.
<br>23	Three years afterwards Jason sent Menelaus, brother of the aforesaid Simon, to carry money to the king, and to bring answers from him concerning certain necessary affairs.
<br>24	But he being recommended to the king, when he had magnified the appearance of his power, got the high priesthood for himself, by offering more than Jason by three hundred tal- ents of silver.
<br>25	So having received the king’s mandate, he returned, bringing nothing worthy of the high priesthood: but having the mind of a cruel tyrant, and the rage of a savage beast.
<br>26	Then Jason, who had undermined his own brother, being himself undermined, was driven out a fugitive into the country of the Ammonites. 27 So Menelaus got the principality: but as for the money he had promised to the king, he took no care,  when Sostratus,  the governor of
<br>the castle, called for it.
<br>28	For to him appertained the gathering of the taxes: wherefore they were both called before the king.
<br>29	And Menelaus was removed from the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>priesthood, Lysimachus, his brother, succeeding: and Sostratus alas made governor of the Cypri- ans.
<br>30	When these things were in doing, it fell out that they of Tharsus, and Mallos, raised a sedition, because they were given for a gift to Antiochus, the king’s concubine.
<br>31	The king, therefore, went in all haste to appease them, leaving Andronicus, one of his no- bles, for his deputy.
<br>32	Then Menelaus supposing that he had found a convenient time, having stolen certain vessels of gold out of the temple, gave them to Andronicus, and others he had sold at Tyre, and in the neighbouring cities:
<br>33	Which when Onias understood most cer- tainly, he reproved him, keeping himself in a safe place at Antioch, beside Daphne.
<br>34	Whereupon Menelaus coming to Andron- icus, desired him to kill Onias. And he went to Onias, and gave him his right hand with an oath, and (though he were suspected by him) persuaded him to come forth out of the sanc- tuary, and immediately slew him, without any regard to justice.
<br>35	For which cause not only the Jews, but also the other nations, conceived indignation, and were much grieved for the unjust murder of so great a man.
<br>36	And when the king was come back from the places of Cilicia, the Jews that were at Antioch, and also the Greeks, went to him: complaining of the unjust murder of Onias.
<br>37	Antiochus, therefore, was grieved in his mind for Onias, and being moved to pity, shed tears, remembering the sobriety and modesty of the deceased.
<br>38	And being inflamed to anger, he com- manded Andronicus to be stripped of his purple, and to be led about through all the city: and that
<br> 
<br>in the same place wherein he had committed the impiety against Onias, the sacrilegious wretch should be put to death, the Lord repaying him his deserved punishment.
