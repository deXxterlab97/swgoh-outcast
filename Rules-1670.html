<br>
<br>85 percent of the amount available for grants under section 12103 of this title for any fiscal year shall be allocated as follows (except that a State may not receive more than 9 percent of the total amount of funds made available under this paragraph):
<br>
<br>(A) 0.75 percent shall be allocated to each State that meets the requirements of section 12103(a) of this title, except that the United States Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, if eligible under section 12103(a) of this title, shall each be allocated 0.05 percent.
<br>
<br>(B) The amount remaining after application of subparagraph (A) shall be allocated to each State that meets the requirements of section 12103(b) of this title, in the ratio that the number of part 1 violent crimes reported by such State to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the 3 years preceding the year in which the determination is made, bears to the average annual number of part 1 violent crimes reported by all States that meet the requirements of section 12103(b) of this title to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the 3 years preceding the year in which the determination is made.
<br>(2) Additional allocation
<br>

<br>
<br>(B) The amount remaining after application of subparagraph (A) shall be allocated to each State that meets the requirements of section 12103(c) of this title, in the ratio that the number of part 1 violent crimes reported by such State to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the 3 years preceding the year in which the determination is made, bears to the average annual number of part 1 violent crimes reported by all States that meet the requirements of section 12102(c) of this title to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the 3 years preceding the year in which the determination is made.
<br>(b) Allocation of truth-in-sentencing grants under section 12104
<br>
<br>The amounts available for grants for section 12104 of this title shall be allocated to each State that meets the requirements of section 12104 of this title in the ratio that the average annual number of part 1 violent crimes reported by such State to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the 3 years preceding the year in which the determination is made bears to the average annual number of part 1 violent crimes reported by States that meet the requirements of section 12104 of this title to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the 3 years preceding the year in which the determination is made, except that a State may not receive more than 25 percent of the total amount available for such grants.
<br>(c) Unavailable data
<br>
<br>If data regarding part 1 violent crimes in any State is substantially inaccurate or is unavailable for the 3 years preceding the year in which the determination is made, the Attorney General shall utilize the best available comparable data regarding the number of violent crimes for the previous year for the State for the purposes of allocation of funds under this part.
<br>(d) Regional compacts
<br>
<br>In determining the amount of funds that States organized as a regional compact may receive, the Attorney General shall first apply the formula in either subsection (a) or (b) and (c) of this section to each member State of the compact. The States organized as a regional compact may receive the sum of the amounts so determined.

Some section numbers or references in amendment notes below reflect the classification of such sections or references prior to editorial reclassification.
<br>
<br>January 5, 2006, referred to in subsec. (i)(2)(A), was in the original "the date of enactment of this Act", which was translated as meaning the date of enactment of Pub. L. 109–162, which enacted subsec. (i)(2) of this section, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.
<br>
<br>Section was enacted as Aimee's Law and also as part of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, and not as part of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 which enacted this chapter.
<br>Amendments
<br>
<br>2006—Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 109–162, §1170(1), substituted "Pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Attorney General hereunder, in this section" for "In this section" in introductory provisions.

(3) by striking "individuals convicted of the offense for which," was executed by striking "individuals convicted of the offense for which" after "imposed by the State on" to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because there was no comma after "which".
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 109–162, §1170(3)(B)(i), which directed that "average" be struck out, was executed by striking out "average" the first place appearing, after "(A) the", to reflect the probable intent of Congress.

<br>In determining where to locate any new Federal prison facility, and in accordance with the Department of Justice's duty to review and identify a use for any portion of an installation closed pursuant to title II of the Defense Authorization Amendments and Base Closure and Realignment Act (Public Law 100–526) and the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (part A of title XXIX of Public Law 101–510), the Attorney General shall—
<br>
<br>(A) consider whether using any portion of a military installation closed or scheduled to be closed in the region pursuant to a base closure law provides a cost-effective alternative to the purchase of real property or construction of new prison facilities;
<br>
<br>(B) consider whether such use is consistent with a reutilization and redevelopment plan; and
<br>
<br>(C) give consideration to any installation located in a rural area the closure of which will have a substantial adverse impact on the economy of the local communities and on the ability of the communities to sustain an economic recovery from such closure.
<br>(2) Consent
<br>
<br>With regard to paragraph (1)(B), consent must be obtained from the local re-use authority for the military installation, recognized and funded by the Secretary of Defense, before the Attorney General may proceed with plans for the design or construction of a prison at the installation.
<br>(3) Report on basis of decision
<br>
<br>Before proceeding with plans for the design or construction of a Federal prison, the Attorney General shall submit to Congress a report explaining the basis of the decision on where to locate the new prison facility.
<br>(4) Report on cost-effectiveness
<br>
<br>If the Attorney General decides not to utilize any portion of a closed military installation or an installation scheduled to be closed for locating a prison, the report shall include an analysis of why installations in the region, the use of which as a prison would be consistent with a reutilization and redevelopment plan, does not provide a cost-effective alternative to the purchase of real property or construction of new prison facilities.
<br>(e) "Base closure law" defined
<br>
<br>In this section, "base closure law" means—
