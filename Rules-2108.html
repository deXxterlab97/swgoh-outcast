The Act, with the exception of title V, most of title VI, and sections 301, 801, 802, 809(a), and 909 thereof, was repealed and restated, mainly in this subtitle, by Pub. L. 109–304, §§8, 19, Oct. 6, 2006, 120 Stat. 1555, 1710. Title V and sections 301 and 909 of the Act are set out as notes under section 53101 of this title. Those portions of title VI not repealed by Pub. L. 109–304 and sections 802 and 809(a) of the Act were repealed by Pub. L. 114–120, title III, §313(a), Feb. 8, 2016, 130 Stat. 58. Section 801 of the Act was transferred to section 57522 of this title by Pub. L. 114–120, title III, §313(c)(1)(A), Feb. 8, 2016, 130 Stat. 58.

<br>§56301. General authority
<br>
<br>During a national emergency declared by Presidential proclamation, or a period for which the President has proclaimed that the security of the national defense makes it advisable, the Secretary of Transportation may requisition or purchase, or requisition or charter the use of, a vessel owned by citizens of the United States, a documented vessel, or a vessel under construction in the United States.

<br>
<br>The words "or other watercraft" are omitted because of the definition of "vessel" in chapter 1 of the revised title. The words "The termination of any emergency so declared shall be announced by a further proclamation by the President" are omitted as superseded by the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.).
<br>§56302. Charter terms
<br>
<br>(a) In General.—If a vessel is requisitioned for use but not ownership under this chapter, the Secretary of Transportation, at the time of requisition or as soon thereafter as the situation allows, shall offer the person entitled to possession of the vessel a charter containing—
<br>
<br>(1) the terms the Secretary believes should govern the relationship between the United States Government and the person; and
<br>
<br>(2) the rate of hire the Secretary considers just compensation for the use of the vessel and the services required under the charter.
<br>
<br>(b) Refusal To Accept.—If the person does not accept the charter and rate of hire, the parties shall proceed as provided in section 56304 of this title.

<br>In subsection (a), the words "requisitioned for use but not ownership under this chapter" are substituted for "taken and used under authority of this section, but the ownership thereof is not required by the United States" to eliminate unnecessary words. The word "requisition" is substituted for "taking", and the word "vessel" is substituted for "such property", for consistency.
<br>
<br>Subsection (b) is added because the provisions about disputed compensation, for both charter use and other takings, are consolidated in section 56304 of the revised title to avoid repetition.
<br>§56303. Compensation
<br>
<br>(a) In General.—As soon as practicable, the Secretary of Transportation shall determine and pay just compensation for a vessel requisitioned under this chapter.
<br>
<br>(b) Factors Not Affecting Value.—The value of a vessel may not be considered enhanced by the circumstances requiring its requisition. Consequential damages arising from the requisition may not be paid.
<br>
<br>(c) Effect of Construction-Differential Subsidy.—
<br>
<br>(1) If paid.—If a construction-differential subsidy has been paid for the vessel, the value of the vessel at the time of requisition shall be determined under section 802 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936.
<br>
<br>(2) If not paid.—If a construction-differential subsidy has not been paid for the vessel, the value of any national defense features previously paid for by the United States Government shall be excluded.
<br>
<br>(d) Loss or Damage During Charter.—If a vessel is lost or damaged by a risk assumed by the Government under the charter, but a valuation for the vessel or a means of compensation has not been agreed to, the Secretary shall pay just compensation for the loss or damage, to the extent the person is not reimbursed through insurance.

<br>§56304. Disputed compensation

The person may bring a civil action against the United States to recover just compensation. If the tentative advance paid under this section is greater than the amount of the court's judgment, the person shall refund the difference.

<br>This section is substituted for the source provisions to eliminate unnecessary words.
<br>§56305. Vessel encumbrances
<br>
<br>(a) In General.—The existence of an encumbrance on a vessel does not prevent the requisition of the vessel under this chapter.
<br>
<br>(b) Deposit in Treasury.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—If an encumbrance exists, the Secretary of Transportation may deposit part of the compensation or advance of compensation to be paid under this chapter (but not more than the total amount of all encumbrances) in a fund in the Treasury. The Secretary shall publish notice of the creation of the fund in the Federal Register.
<br>
<br>(2) Availability of amounts deposited.—Amounts deposited in the fund shall be available to pay the compensation or any of the encumbrances (including encumbrances stipulated to in a court of the United States or a State) existing at the time the vessel was requisitioned.
<br>
<br>(c) Civil Action.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—Within 6 months after publication of notice under subsection (b), the holder of an encumbrance may bring a civil action in admiralty, according to the principles of libels in rem, against the fund.
<br>
<br>(2) Venue.—The action must be brought in the district court of the United States—
<br>
<br>(A) from whose custody the vessel was or may be requisitioned; or
<br>
<br>(B) in whose district the vessel was located when it was requisitioned.
<br>
<br>(3) Service of process.—Service of process shall be made on the appropriate United States Attorney, the Attorney General, and the Secretary, in the manner provided by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 App. U.S.C.). Notice of the action shall be given to all interested persons as ordered by the court.
<br>
<br>(4) As between private parties.—The action shall proceed and be determined according to the principles of law and the rules of practice applicable in like cases between private parties.

<br>
<br>In subsection (b)(1), the words "The Secretary shall publish notice of the creation of the fund in the Federal Register" are added for clarity, based on language barring a civil action not brought within 6 months after publication of such a notice.
<br>
<br>In subsection (c)(1), the words "Within 6 months after publication of notice under subsection (b)" are substituted for "prior to June 30, 1943, or within six months after the first such deposit with the Treasurer and publication of notice thereof in the Federal Register, whichever date is later" for clarity and to eliminate obsolete language.
<br>
<br>Subsection (c)(3) is substituted for "and such suit shall be commenced in the manner provided by section 742 of this Appendix and service of process shall be made in the manner therein provided by service upon the United States attorney and by mailing by registered mail to the Attorney General and the Secretary of Transportation and due notice shall under order of the court be given to all interested persons" because the relevant sentences in 46 App. U.S.C. 742 were struck by an amendment in 1996. See generally Henderson v. United States, 517 U.S. 654, 116 S. Ct. 1638 (1996).
<br>
<br>In subsection (c)(4), the words "any decree in said suit shall be paid out of the first and all subsequent deposits of compensation" and "any decree shall be subject to appeal and revision as now provided in other cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction" are omitted as surplus.
<br>§56306. Use and transfer of vessels
<br>
<br>(a) In General.—The Secretary of Transportation may repair, recondition, reconstruct, operate, or charter for operation, a vessel acquired under this chapter.
<br>

<br>
<br>When a vessel requisitioned for use but not ownership is returned to the owner, the Secretary of Transportation shall—
<br>
<br>(1) return the vessel in a condition at least as good as when taken, less ordinary wear and tear; or

<br>(2) pay the owner an amount sufficient to recondition the vessel to that condition, less ordinary wear and tear.

<br>In the case of any vessel constructed in the United States after January 1, 1937, which has been taken by the United States for use in any manner, the Secretary of Transportation, if in his opinion the transfer would aid in carrying out the policies of this Act,1 is authorized to transfer to the owner of such vessel another vessel which is deemed by the Secretary to be of comparable type with adjustments for depreciation and difference in design or speed, and to the extent applicable, such other adjustments and terms and conditions, including transfer of mortgage obligations in favor of the United States binding upon the old vessel, as the Secretary may prescribe.

<br>§56311. Requisitioned vessels
<br>
<br>(a) Any vessel not documented under the laws of the United States, acquired by or made available to the Secretary of Transportation under section 56309 or 56310, as applicable, or otherwise, may, notwithstanding any other provision of law, in the discretion of the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating be documented as a vessel of the United States under such rules and regulations or orders, and with such limitations, as the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating may prescribe or issue as necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes and provisions of section 56309 or 56310, as applicable, and in accordance with the provisions of subsection (c), engage in the coastwise trade when so documented. Any document issued to a vessel under the provisions of this subsection shall be surrendered at any time that such surrender may be ordered by the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating. No vessel, the surrender of the documents of which has been so ordered, shall, after the effective date of such order, have the status of a vessel of the United States unless documented anew.
<br>
<br>(b) The President may, notwithstanding any other provisions of law, by rules and regulations or orders, waive compliance with any provision of law relating to masters, officers, members of the crew, or crew accommodations on any vessel documented under authority of this section to such extent and upon such terms as he finds necessary because of the lack of physical facilities on such vessels, and because of the need to employ aliens for their operation. No vessel shall cease to enjoy the benefits and privileges of a vessel of the United States by reason of the employment of any person in accordance with the provisions of this subsection.
<br>
<br>(c) Any vessel while documented under the provisions of this section, when chartered under section 56309 or 56310, as applicable, by the Secretary of Transportation to Government agencies or departments or to private operators, may engage in the coastwise trade under permits issued by the Secretary of Transportation, who is authorized to issue permits for such purpose pursuant to such rules and regulations as he may prescribe. The Secretary of Transportation is authorized to prescribe such rules and regulations as he may deem necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes and provisions of this section. Section 57109 shall not apply with respect to vessels chartered to Government agencies or departments or to private operators or otherwise used or disposed of under section 56309 or 56310, as applicable. Existing laws covering the inspection of steam vessels are made applicable to vessels documented under this section only to such extent and upon such conditions as may be required by regulations of the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating: Provided, That in determining to what extent those laws should be made applicable, due consideration shall be given to the primary purpose of transporting commodities essential to the national defense.
<br>
<br>(d) The Secretary of Transportation without regard to the 1 section 6101 of title 41 may repair, reconstruct, or recondition any vessels to be utilized under section 56309 or 56310, as applicable. The Secretary of Transportation and any other Government department or agency by which any vessel is acquired or chartered, or to which any vessel is transferred or made available under section 56309 or 56310, as applicable, may, with the aid of any funds available and without regard to the provisions of section 6101 of title 41, repair, reconstruct, or recondition any such vessels to meet the needs of the services intended, or provide facilities for such repair, reconstruction, or reconditioning.
