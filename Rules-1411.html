<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §1 and section 863 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions (Apr. 12, 1900, ch. 191, §34, 31 Stat. 84; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §1, 36 Stat. 1087; Jan. 7, 1913; ch. 6, 37 Stat. 648; July 30, 1914, ch. 216, 38 Stat. 580; Mar. 2, 1917, ch. 145, §41, 39 Stat. 965; Mar. 4, 1921, ch. 161, §1, 41 Stat. 1412; Sept. 14, 1922, ch. 306, §1, 42 Stat. 837; Mar. 26, 1938, ch. 51, §2, 52 Stat. 118).
<br>
<br>Section consolidates the last paragraph of section 1 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with portions of section 863 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with changes in phraseology necessary to effect consolidation.
<br>
<br>Provisions of section 1 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to the number of judges in the various districts are incorporated in section 133 of this title.
<br>
<br>A portion of section 863 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., is retained in said title 48. For remainder of section 863, see Distribution Table.
<br>
<br>The exception in subsection (b) "except in the District of Columbia" conforms with the recent decision in U.S. ex. rel. Laughlin v. Eicher, 1944, 56 F.Supp. 972, holding that residence requirement of section 1 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., did not apply to district judges in the District of Columbia. (See reviser's note under section 44 of this title.)
<br>
<br>The clause in said last paragraph of section 1 of title 28 providing that any district judge, who violates the residence requirement, shall be deemed guilty of a high misdemeanor, was omitted. This penalty provision was attached to the residence requirement at the time of compilation of the Revised Statutes of 1878, although it is apparent that Congress only intended that the penalty should be invoked upon the unauthorized practice of law. See U.S. ex. rel. Laughlin v. Eicher, supra, in which an outline of the history of said section 1 of title 28 is given.

<br>
<br>Section consolidates section 5 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and section 11–302 of the District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed.
<br>
<br>"Chief judge," in the District of Columbia, was substituted for "Chief Justice" which appeared in section 11–302 of the District of Columbia Code. (See reviser's note under section 136 of this title.)

Such section 5a is recommended for transfer to title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., because of the dual nature of the Virgin Islands district court.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §375 and District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., §11–301 (Mar. 3, 1901, ch. 854, §§60, 61, 31 Stat. 1199; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §260, 36 Stat. 1161; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §289, 32 Stat. 1167; Feb. 25, 1919, ch. 29, §6, 40 Stat. 1157; Dec. 20, 1928, ch. 41, 45 Stat. 1056; Mar. 1, 1929, ch. 419, 45 Stat. 1422; June 19, 1930, ch. 537, 46 Stat. 785; May 31, 1938, ch. 290, §5, 52 Stat. 584).
<br>
<br>Section consolidates portions of section 375 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and section 11–301 of the District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed. The provisions of said section 375 relating to resignation and retirement of judges, and appointment of court officers, are incorporated in sections 294, 371, and 756 of this title. Other provisions of said section 11–301 of the District of Columbia Code are incorporated in section 133 of this title.
<br>
<br>Subsection (a), providing for a "chief judge" is new. Such term replaces the terms "senior district judge," and "Chief Justice" of the District Court in the District of Columbia. It is employed in view of the great increase of administrative duties of such judge. The use of the term "chief judge" with respect to the District of Columbia will result in uniform nomenclature for all district courts. The district judges of that court have expressed approval of such designation.
<br>
<br>The provision in said section 11–301 of the District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., that the "Chief Justice" shall be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, was omitted for the purpose of establishing a uniform method of creating the position of chief judge in all districts. The District of Columbia is expressly made a judicial district by section 88 of this title.
<br>
<br>Subsection (b) is new and conforms with similar provisions respecting associate justices of the Supreme Court and circuit judges in sections 4 and 45 of this title.
<br>
<br>Subsection (c) is from the proviso in the second paragraph of section 375 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which applied only in cases of appointment of court officers. Here it is made applicable to all district judges.
<br>
<br>Subsections (d) and (e) are new, and conform with section 44 of this title relating to precedence of circuit judges.
<br>
<br>The official status of the Chief Justice of the District Court for the District of Columbia holding office at the effective date of this act is preserved by section 2 of the bill to enact revised title 28.

(2)(A) as so designated, and added pars. (2)(B) and (3).

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>The purpose of this section is to remove all doubt as to whether the mere beginning of a new term at one place ends a prior term begun at another place. As revised, it conforms to a uniform course of judicial decisions. See U.S. v. Perlstein, 39 F.Supp. 965, 968 (D.C.N.J. 1941), and cases cited.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§16, 146, 182 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §§12, 73, 101, 36 Stat. 1088, 1108, 1122; June 12, 1916, ch. 143, 39 Stat. 225; Feb. 20, 1917, ch. 102, 39 Stat. 927; June 13, 1918, ch. 98, 40 Stat. 604; Feb. 26, 1919, ch. 54, 40 Stat. 1184; May 29, 1924, ch. 209, 43 Stat. 243; June 5, 1924, ch. 259, 43 Stat. 387; Jan. 10, 1925, chs. 68, 69, 43 Stat. 730, 731; Feb. 16, 1925, ch. 233, §1, 43 Stat. 945; May 7, 1926, ch. 255, 44 Stat. 408; Apr. 21, 1928, ch. 395, 45 Stat. 440; Mar. 2, 1929, ch. 539, 45 Stat. 1518; June 28, 1930, ch. 714, 46 Stat. 829; May 13, 1936, ch. 386, 49 Stat. 1271; Aug. 12, 1937, ch. 595, 50 Stat. 625).
<br>
<br>Section consolidates section 16 with the third sentence of section 146, and the final proviso in the third paragraph of section 182, all of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.
<br>
<br>Said section 16 of title 28 provided for adjournment by the marshal, or clerk, on written order of the judge, in case of inability of the district judge to attend at the commencement of any regular, adjourned or special term, or any time during such term. Said sections 146 and 182 thereof, related to the district courts of Colorado and Oklahoma, only, and contained special provisions for adjournment. Subsection (b) omits the requirement of written order where the judge is unable to make such order.
<br>
<br>The revised section broadens these provisions, and vests discretionary power in the court, by order made anywhere within the district, to adjourn any term of court "for insufficient business or other good cause." To establish uniformity, the special provisions relating to Colorado and Oklahoma were omitted.
<br>
<br>Other provisions of said sections 146 and 182 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in sections 85 and 116 of this title.
<br>
<br>The provision of subsection (a) authorizing the district court, with the consent of the judicial council of the circuit, to pretermit any term of court for insufficient business or other good cause, is inserted to obviate the expense and inconvenience of convening and adjourning a term for which no need exists.

<br>(a)(1) Special sessions of the district court may be held at such places in the district as the nature of the business may require, and upon such notice as the court orders.
<br>
<br>(2) Any business may be transacted at a special session which might be transacted at a regular session.
<br>
<br>(b)(1) Special sessions of the district court may be held at such places within the United States outside the district as the nature of the business may require and upon such notice as the court orders, upon a finding by either the chief judge of the district court (or, if the chief judge is unavailable, the most senior available active judge of the district court) or the judicial council of the circuit that, because of emergency conditions, no location within the district is reasonably available where such special sessions could be held.
<br>
<br>(2) Pursuant to this subsection, any business which may be transacted at a regular session of a district court may be transacted at a special session conducted outside the district, except that a criminal trial may not be conducted at a special session outside the State in which the crime has been committed unless the defendant consents to such a criminal trial.
<br>
<br>(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in any case in which special sessions are conducted pursuant to this section, the district court may summon jurors—
<br>
<br>(A) in civil proceedings, from any part of the district in which the court ordinarily conducts business or the district in which it is holding a special session; and
<br>
<br>(B) in criminal trials, from any part of the district in which the crime has been committed and, if the defendant so consents, from any district in which the court is conducting business pursuant to this section.

<br>(4) If a district court issues an order exercising its authority under paragraph (1), the court—
<br>
<br>(A) through the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, shall—
<br>
<br>(i) send notice of such order, including the reasons for the issuance of such order, to the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate and the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives; and
<br>
<br>(ii) not later than 180 days after the expiration of such court order submit a brief report to the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate and the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives describing the impact of such order, including—
<br>
<br>(I) the reasons for the issuance of such order;
<br>
<br>(II) the duration of such order;
<br>
<br>(III) the impact of such order on litigants; and
<br>
<br>(IV) the costs to the judiciary resulting from such order; and
<br>
<br>(B) shall provide reasonable notice to the United States Marshals Service before the commencement of any special session held pursuant to such order.
<br>
<br>(5) If a district court issues an order exercising its authority under paragraph (1), the court shall direct the United States marshal of the district where the court is meeting to furnish transportation and subsistence to the same extent as that provided in sections 4282 and 4285 of title 18.

<br>
<br>(c)(1) Each bankruptcy judge may hold court at such places within the judicial district, in addition to the official duty station of such judge, as the business of the court may require.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) Bankruptcy judges may hold court at such places within the United States outside the judicial district as the nature of the business of the court may require, and upon such notice as the court orders, upon a finding by either the chief judge of the bankruptcy court (or, if the chief judge is unavailable, the most senior available bankruptcy judge) or by the judicial council of the circuit that, because of emergency conditions, no location within the district is reasonably available where the bankruptcy judges could hold court.

<br>
<br>(bb) the duration of such order;
<br>
<br>(cc) the impact of such order on litigants; and
<br>
<br>(dd) the costs to the judiciary resulting from such order; and
<br>
<br>(ii) shall provide reasonable notice to the United States Marshals Service before the commencement of any special session held pursuant to such order.
<br>
<br>(d) With the approval of the Judicial Conference and of each of the judicial councils involved, a bankruptcy judge may be designated to serve in any district adjacent to or near the district for which such bankruptcy judge was appointed.
<br>
<br>(e) A bankruptcy judge may be removed during the term for which such bankruptcy judge is appointed, only for incompetence, misconduct, neglect of duty, or physical or mental disability and only by the judicial council of the circuit in which the judge's official duty station is located. Removal may not occur unless a majority of all of the judges of such council concur in the order of removal.
