<br>(2) Amounts based on estimates
<br>
<br>The amounts appropriated under this section shall be transferred at least monthly from the general fund of the Treasury of the United States to the Agricultural Disaster Relief Trust Fund on the basis of estimates made by the Secretary of the Treasury.

<br>(2) Investment
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Treasury shall invest such portion of the Agricultural Disaster Relief Trust Fund as is not in his judgment required to meet current withdrawals. Such investments may be made only in interest bearing obligations of the United States. For such purpose, such obligations may be acquired—
<br>
<br>(i) on original issue at the issue price, or
<br>
<br>(ii) by purchase of outstanding obligations at the market price.
<br>(B) Sale of obligations
<br>
<br>Any obligation acquired by the Agricultural Disaster Relief Trust Fund may be sold by the Secretary of the Treasury at the market price.
<br>(C) Interest on certain proceeds
<br>
<br>The interest on, and the proceeds from the sale or redemption of, any obligations held in the Agricultural Disaster Relief Trust Fund shall be credited to and form a part of such Trust Fund.
<br>(d) Expenditures from Trust Fund
<br>
<br>Amounts in the Agricultural Disaster Relief Trust Fund shall be available for the purposes of making expenditures to meet those obligations of the United States incurred under section 2497 of this title or section 1531 of title 7 (as such sections are in effect on the date of the enactment of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008).

<br>(B) Rate of interest
<br>
<br>Interest on advances made pursuant to this subsection shall be—
<br>
<br>(i) at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury (as of the close of the calendar month preceding the month in which the advance is made) to be equal to the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the anticipated period during which the advance will be outstanding, and
<br>
<br>(ii) compounded annually.
