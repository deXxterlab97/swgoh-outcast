<br>
<br>(a) Stipulation of Discharge.—
<br>
<br>(1) Person asserting claim entitled to benefits.—In a judicial proceeding under the laws of a State, district, territory, or possession of the United States, when property owned or held by the Federal Government, or in which the Government has or claims an interest, is seized, arrested, attached, or held for the security or satisfaction of a claim made against the property, the Attorney General may direct the United States Attorney for the district in which the property is located to enter a stipulation that on discharge of the property from the seizure, arrest, attachment, or proceeding, the person asserting the claim against the property becomes entitled to all the benefits of this section.
<br>
<br>(2) Nonapplication.—This subsection does not—
<br>
<br>(A) recognize or concede any right to enforce by seizure, arrest, attachment, or any judicial process a claim against property—
<br>
<br>(i) of the Government; or
<br>
<br>(ii) held, owned, or employed by the Government, or by a department of the Government, for a public use; or
<br>
<br>(B) waive an objection to a proceeding brought to enforce the claim.
<br>
<br>(b) Payment.—After a discharge, a final judgment which affirms the claim for the security or satisfaction and the right of the person asserting the claim to enforce it against the property, notwithstanding the claims of the Government, is deemed to be a full and final determination of the rights of the person and entitles the person, as against the Government, to the rights the person would have had if possession of the property had not been changed. When the claim is for the payment of money found to be due, presentation of an authenticated copy of the record of the judgment and proceedings is sufficient evidence to the proper accounting officers for the allowance of the claim, which shall be allowed and paid out of amounts in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated. The amount allowed and paid shall not exceed the value of the interest of the Government in the property.

<br>2002—Pub. L. 107–296 amended catchline and text generally. Prior to amendment, text read as follows:
<br>
<br>"(a) Appointment.—The Administrator of General Services, or an official of the General Services Administration authorized by the Administrator, may appoint uniformed guards of the Administration as special police without additional compensation for duty in connection with the policing of all buildings and areas owned or occupied by the Federal Government and under the charge and control of the Administrator.
<br>
<br>"(b) Powers.—Special police appointed under this section have the same powers as sheriffs and constables on property referred to in subsection (a) to enforce laws enacted for the protection of individuals and property, prevent breaches of the peace, suppress affrays or unlawful assemblies, and enforce regulations prescribed by the Administrator or an official of the Administration authorized by the Administrator for property under their jurisdiction. However, the jurisdiction and policing powers of special police do not extend to the service of civil process.
<br>
<br>"(c) Detail.—On the application of the head of a department or agency of the Government having property of the Government under its administration and control, the Administrator or an official of the Administration authorized by the Administrator may detail special police for the protection of the property and, if the Administrator considers it desirable, may extend to the property the applicability of regulations and enforce them as provided in this section.
<br>
<br>"(d) Use of Other Law Enforcement Agencies.—When it is considered economical and in the public interest, the Administrator or an official of the Administration authorized by the Administrator may utilize the facilities and services of existing federal law enforcement agencies, and, with the consent of a state or local agency, the facilities and services of state or local law enforcement agencies.
<br>
<br>"(e) Nonuniformed Special Police.—The Administrator, or an official of the Administration authorized by the Administrator, may empower officials or employees of the Administration authorized to perform investigative functions to act as nonuniformed special police to protect property under the charge and control of the Administration and to carry firearms, whether on federal property or in travel status. When on real property under the charge and control of the Administration, officials or employees empowered to act as nonuniformed special police have the power to enforce federal laws for the protection of individuals and property and to enforce regulations for that purpose that the Administrator or an official of the Administration authorized by the Administrator prescribes and publishes. The special police may make arrests without warrant for any offense committed on the property if the police have reasonable grounds to believe the offense constitutes a felony under the laws of the United States and that the individual to be arrested is guilty of that offense.
<br>
<br>"(f) Administrative.—The Administrator or an official of the Administration authorized by the Administrator may prescribe regulations necessary for the government of the property under their charge and control, and may annex to the regulations reasonable penalties, within the limits prescribed in subsection (g), that will ensure their enforcement. The regulations shall be posted and kept posted in a conspicuous place on the property.
<br>
<br>"(g) Penalties.—
<br>
<br>"(1) In general.—Except as provided in paragraph (2), a person violating a regulation prescribed under subsection (f) shall be fined under title 18, imprisoned for not more than 30 days, or both.
<br>
<br>"(2) Exception for military traffic regulation.—
<br>
<br>"(A) Definition.—For purposes of this paragraph, the term 'military traffic regulation' means a regulation for the control of vehicular or pedestrian traffic on military installations that the Secretary of Defense prescribes under subsection (f).
<br>
<br>"(B) In general.—A person violating a military traffic regulation shall be fined an amount not exceeding the amount of the maximum fine for a similar offense under the criminal or civil law of the State, district, territory, or possession of the United States where the military installation in which the violation occurred is located, imprisoned for not more than 30 days, or both."

<br>The word "subtreasuries" in the 6th complete paragraph on p. 614 of section 1 of the Act of July 1, 1898 (ch. 546, 30 Stat. 614), is omitted because section 1 (words in par. under heading "Independent Treasury") of the Act of May 29, 1914 (ch. 214, 41 Stat. 654) discontinued subtreasuries. The word "post-offices" in section 1 is omitted because section 1 of Executive Order No. 6166 (eff. June 10, 1933) transferred administration of post office buildings to the Post Office Department. The words "courthouses, customhouses, appraiser's stores, barge offices, and other" are omitted as unnecessary. The words "or are in course of construction" are omitted as obsolete. The words "Administrator of General Services" are substituted for "Treasury Department" and "Secretary of the Treasury" [subsequently changed to "Federal Works Agency" and "Federal Works Administrator" because of sections 301 and 303, respectively, of Reorganization Plan No. I of 1939 (eff.

The amount of the payment bond shall not be less than the amount of the performance bond.
<br>
<br>(c) Coverage for Taxes in Performance Bond.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—Every performance bond required under this section specifically shall provide coverage for taxes the Government imposes which are collected, deducted, or withheld from wages the contractor pays in carrying out the contract with respect to which the bond is furnished.
<br>
<br>(2) Notice.—The Government shall give the surety on the bond written notice, with respect to any unpaid taxes attributable to any period, within 90 days after the date when the contractor files a return for the period, except that notice must be given no later than 180 days from the date when a return for the period was required to be filed under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.).

<br>
<br>(A) unless notice is given as provided in this subsection; and
<br>
<br>(B) more than one year after the day on which notice is given.
<br>
<br>(d) Waiver of Bonds for Contracts Performed in Foreign Countries.—A contracting officer may waive the requirement of a performance bond and payment bond for work under a contract that is to be performed in a foreign country if the officer finds that it is impracticable for the contractor to furnish the bonds.
<br>
<br>(e) Authority To Require Additional Bonds.—This section does not limit the authority of a contracting officer to require a performance bond or other security in addition to those, or in cases other than the cases, specified in subsection (b).

<br>In subsection (b)(2), the words "to the contractor at any place he maintains an office or conducts his business, or his residence, or in any manner in which the United States marshal of the district in which the public improvement is situated is authorized by law to serve summons" are restated to reflect the probable intent of Congress.
