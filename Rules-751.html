<br>§2302. Rules governing contents of warranties
<br>(a) Full and conspicuous disclosure of terms and conditions; additional requirements for contents
<br>
<br>In order to improve the adequacy of information available to consumers, prevent deception, and improve competition in the marketing of consumer products, any warrantor warranting a consumer product to a consumer by means of a written warranty shall, to the extent required by rules of the Commission, fully and conspicuously disclose in simple and readily understood language the terms and conditions of such warranty. Such rules may require inclusion in the written warranty of any of the following items among others:

<br>
<br>(2) The identity of the party or parties to whom the warranty is extended.
<br>
<br>(3) The products or parts covered.
<br>
<br>(4) A statement of what the warrantor will do in the event of a defect, malfunction, or failure to conform with such written warranty—at whose expense—and for what period of time.
<br>
<br>(5) A statement of what the consumer must do and expenses he must bear.
<br>
<br>(6) Exceptions and exclusions from the terms of the warranty.
<br>
<br>(7) The step-by-step procedure which the consumer should take in order to obtain performance of any obligation under the warranty, including the identification of any person or class of persons authorized to perform the obligations set forth in the warranty.
<br>
<br>(8) Information respecting the availability of any informal dispute settlement procedure offered by the warrantor and a recital, where the warranty so provides, that the purchaser may be required to resort to such procedure before pursuing any legal remedies in the courts.
<br>
<br>(9) A brief, general description of the legal remedies available to the consumer.
<br>
<br>(10) The time at which the warrantor will perform any obligations under the warranty.
<br>
<br>(11) The period of time within which, after notice of a defect, malfunction, or failure to conform with the warranty, the warrantor will perform any obligations under the warranty.
<br>
<br>(12) The characteristics or properties of the products, or parts thereof, that are not covered by the warranty.
<br>
<br>(13) The elements of the warranty in words or phrases which would not mislead a reasonable, average consumer as to the nature or scope of the warranty.
<br>(b) Availability of terms to consumer; manner and form for presentation and display of information; duration; extension of period for written warranty or service contract; electronic display of terms of warranty
<br>
<br>(1)(A) The Commission shall prescribe rules requiring that the terms of any written warranty on a consumer product be made available to the consumer (or prospective consumer) prior to the sale of the product to him.
<br>
<br>(B) The Commission may prescribe rules for determining the manner and form in which information with respect to any written warranty of a consumer product shall be clearly and conspicuously presented or displayed so as not to mislead the reasonable, average consumer, when such information is contained in advertising, labeling, point-of-sale material, or other representations in writing.
<br>
<br>(2) Nothing in this chapter (other than paragraph (3) of this subsection) shall be deemed to authorize the Commission to prescribe the duration of written warranties given or to require that a consumer product or any of its components be warranted.
<br>
<br>(3) The Commission may prescribe rules for extending the period of time a written warranty or service contract is in effect to correspond with any period of time in excess of a reasonable period (not less than 10 days) during which the consumer is deprived of the use of such consumer product by reason of failure of the product to conform with the written warranty or by reason of the failure of the warrantor (or service contractor) to carry out such warranty (or service contract) within the period specified in the warranty (or service contract).
<br>
<br>(4)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the rules prescribed under this subsection shall allow for the satisfaction of all requirements concerning the availability of terms of a written warranty on a consumer product under this subsection by—
<br>
<br>(i) making available such terms in an accessible digital format on the Internet website of the manufacturer of the consumer product in a clear and conspicuous manner; and
<br>
<br>(ii) providing to the consumer (or prospective consumer) information with respect to how to obtain and review such terms by indicating on the product or product packaging or in the product manual—
<br>
<br>(I) the Internet website of the manufacturer where such terms can be obtained and reviewed; and
<br>
<br>(II) the phone number of the manufacturer, the postal mailing address of the manufacturer, or another reasonable non-Internet based means of contacting the manufacturer to obtain and review such terms.
<br>
<br>(B) With respect to any requirement that the terms of any written warranty for a consumer product be made available to the consumer (or prospective consumer) prior to sale of the product, in a case in which a consumer product is offered for sale in a retail location, by catalog, or through door-to-door sales, subparagraph (A) shall only apply if the seller makes available, through electronic or other means, at the location of the sale to the consumer purchasing the consumer product the terms of the warranty for the consumer product before the purchase.
<br>(c) Prohibition on conditions for written or implied warranty; waiver by Commission
<br>
<br>No warrantor of a consumer product may condition his written or implied warranty of such product on the consumer's using, in connection with such product, any article or service (other than article or service provided without charge under the terms of the warranty) which is identified by brand, trade, or corporate name; except that the prohibition of this subsection may be waived by the Commission if—
<br>
<br>(1) the warrantor satisfies the Commission that the warranted product will function properly only if the article or service so identified is used in connection with the warranted product, and
<br>
<br>(2) the Commission finds that such a waiver is in the public interest.
<br>
<br>The Commission shall identify in the Federal Register, and permit public comment on, all applications for waiver of the prohibition of this subsection, and shall publish in the Federal Register its disposition of any such application, including the reasons therefor.
<br>(d) Incorporation by reference of detailed substantive warranty provisions
<br>
<br>The Commission may by rule devise detailed substantive warranty provisions which warrantors may incorporate by reference in their warranties.
<br>(e) Applicability to consumer products costing more than $5
<br>
<br>The provisions of this section apply only to warranties which pertain to consumer products actually costing the consumer more than $5.

<br>Revision of Rules
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 114–51, §3(b), Sept. 24, 2015, 129 Stat. 495, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(1) In general.—Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act [Sept. 24, 2015], the Federal Trade Commission shall revise the rules prescribed under such section [meaning section 102(b) of Pub. L. 93–637, which is classified to subsec. (b) of this section] to comply with the requirements of paragraph (4) of such section, as added by subsection (a) of this section [amending this section].
<br>
<br>"(2) Authority to waive requirement for oral presentation.—In revising rules under paragraph (1), the Federal Trade Commission may waive the requirement of section 109(a) of such Act (15 U.S.C. 2309(a)) to give interested persons an opportunity for oral presentation if the Commission determines that giving interested persons such opportunity would interfere with the ability of the Commission to revise rules under paragraph (1) in a timely manner."
<br>§2303. Designation of written warranties
<br>(a) Full (statement of duration) or limited warranty
<br>
<br>Any warrantor warranting a consumer product by means of a written warranty shall clearly and conspicuously designate such warranty in the following manner, unless exempted from doing so by the Commission pursuant to subsection (c) of this section:
<br>
<br>(1) If the written warranty meets the Federal minimum standards for warranty set forth in section 2304 of this title, then it shall be conspicuously designated a "full (statement of duration) warranty".
<br>
<br>(2) If the written warranty does not meet the Federal minimum standards for warranty set forth in section 2304 of this title, then it shall be conspicuously designated a "limited warranty".
<br>(b) Applicability of requirements, standards, etc., to representations or statements of customer satisfaction
<br>
<br>This section and sections 2302 and 2304 of this title shall not apply to statements or representations which are similar to expressions of general policy concerning customer satisfaction and which are not subject to any specific limitations.
<br>(c) Exemptions by Commission
<br>
<br>In addition to exercising the authority pertaining to disclosure granted in section 2302 of this title, the Commission may by rule determine when a written warranty does not have to be designated either "full (statement of duration)" or "limited" in accordance with this section.
<br>(d) Applicability to consumer products costing more than $10 and not designated as full warranties
<br>
<br>The provisions of subsections (a) and (c) of this section apply only to warranties which pertain to consumer products actually costing the consumer more than $10 and which are not designated "full (statement of duration) warranties".
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 93–637, title I, §103, Jan. 4, 1975, 88 Stat. 2187.)
<br>§2304. Federal minimum standards for warranties
<br>(a) Remedies under written warranty; duration of implied warranty; exclusion or limitation on consequential damages for breach of written or implied warranty; election of refund or replacement
<br>
<br>In order for a warrantor warranting a consumer product by means of a written warranty to meet the Federal minimum standards for warranty—
<br>
<br>(1) such warrantor must as a minimum remedy such consumer product within a reasonable time and without charge, in the case of a defect, malfunction, or failure to conform with such written warranty;
<br>
<br>(2) notwithstanding section 2308(b) of this title, such warrantor may not impose any limitation on the duration of any implied warranty on the product;
<br>
<br>(3) such warrantor may not exclude or limit consequential damages for breach of any written or implied warranty on such product, unless such exclusion or limitation conspicuously appears on the face of the warranty; and
<br>
<br>(4) if the product (or a component part thereof) contains a defect or malfunction after a reasonable number of attempts by the warrantor to remedy defects or malfunctions in such product, such warrantor must permit the consumer to elect either a refund for, or replacement without charge of, such product or part (as the case may be). The Commission may by rule specify for purposes of this paragraph, what constitutes a reasonable number of attempts to remedy particular kinds of defects or malfunctions under different circumstances. If the warrantor replaces a component part of a consumer product, such replacement shall include installing the part in the product without charge.
<br>(b) Duties and conditions imposed on consumer by warrantor
<br>
<br>(1) In fulfilling the duties under subsection (a) respecting a written warranty, the warrantor shall not impose any duty other than notification upon any consumer as a condition of securing remedy of any consumer product which malfunctions, is defective, or does not conform to the written warranty, unless the warrantor has demonstrated in a rulemaking proceeding, or can demonstrate in an administrative or judicial enforcement proceeding (including private enforcement), or in an informal dispute settlement proceeding, that such a duty is reasonable.
<br>
<br>(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a warrantor may require, as a condition to replacement of, or refund for, any consumer product under subsection (a), that such consumer product shall be made available to the warrantor free and clear of liens and other encumbrances, except as otherwise provided by rule or order of the Commission in cases in which such a requirement would not be practicable.
<br>
<br>(3) The Commission may, by rule define in detail the duties set forth in subsection (a) of this section and the applicability of such duties to warrantors of different categories of consumer products with "full (statement of duration)" warranties.
<br>
<br>(4) The duties under subsection (a) extend from the warrantor to each person who is a consumer with respect to the consumer product.
<br>(c) Waiver of standards
<br>
<br>The performance of the duties under subsection (a) shall not be required of the warrantor if he can show that the defect, malfunction, or failure of any warranted consumer product to conform with a written warranty, was caused by damage (not resulting from defect or malfunction) while in the possession of the consumer, or unreasonable use (including failure to provide reasonable and necessary maintenance).
<br>(d) Remedy without charge
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section and of section 2302(c) of this title, the term "without charge" means that the warrantor may not assess the consumer for any costs the warrantor or his representatives incur in connection with the required remedy of a warranted consumer product. An obligation under subsection (a)(1)(A) to remedy without charge does not necessarily require the warrantor to compensate the consumer for incidental expenses; however, if any incidental expenses are incurred because the remedy is not made within a reasonable time or because the warrantor imposed an unreasonable duty upon the consumer as a condition of securing remedy, then the consumer shall be entitled to recover reasonable incidental expenses which are so incurred in any action against the warrantor.
<br>(e) Incorporation of standards to products designated with full warranty for purposes of judicial actions
<br>
<br>If a supplier designates a warranty applicable to a consumer product as a "full (statement of duration)" warranty, then the warranty on such product shall, for purposes of any action under section 2310(d) of this title or under any State law, be deemed to incorporate at least the minimum requirements of this section and rules prescribed under this section.

<br>(a) Restrictions on disclaimers or modifications
<br>

<br>(b) Limitation on duration
<br>
<br>For purposes of this chapter (other than section 2304(a)(2) of this title), implied warranties may be limited in duration to the duration of a written warranty of reasonable duration, if such limitation is conscionable and is set forth in clear and unmistakable language and prominently displayed on the face of the warranty.

<br>
<br>Any rule prescribed under this chapter shall be prescribed in accordance with section 553 of title 5; except that the Commission shall give interested persons an opportunity for oral presentations of data, views, and arguments, in addition to written submissions. A transcript shall be kept of any oral presentation. Any such rule shall be subject to judicial review under section 57a(e) of this title in the same manner as rules prescribed under section 57a(a)(1)(B) of this title, except that section 57a(e)(3)(B) of this title shall not apply.
<br>(b) Warranties and warranty practices involved in sale of used motor vehicles

<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 93–637, title I, §109, Jan. 4, 1975, 88 Stat. 2189.)
<br>§2310. Remedies in consumer disputes
<br>(a) Informal dispute settlement procedures; establishment; rules setting forth minimum requirements; effect of compliance by warrantor; review of informal procedures or implementation by Commission; application to existing informal procedures
<br>
<br>(1) Congress hereby declares it to be its policy to encourage warrantors to establish procedures whereby consumer disputes are fairly and expeditiously settled through informal dispute settlement mechanisms.
<br>
<br>(2) The Commission shall prescribe rules setting forth minimum requirements for any informal dispute settlement procedure which is incorporated into the terms of a written warranty to which any provision of this chapter applies. Such rules shall provide for participation in such procedure by independent or governmental entities.
<br>
<br>(3) One or more warrantors may establish an informal dispute settlement procedure which meets the requirements of the Commission's rules under paragraph (2). If—
<br>
<br>(A) a warrantor establishes such a procedure,
<br>
<br>(B) such procedure, and its implementation, meets the requirements of such rules, and
<br>
<br>(C) he incorporates in a written warranty a requirement that the consumer resort to such procedure before pursuing any legal remedy under this section respecting such warranty,
<br>
<br>then (i) the consumer may not commence a civil action (other than a class action) under subsection (d) of this section unless he initially resorts to such procedure; and (ii) a class of consumers may not proceed in a class action under subsection (d) except to the extent the court determines necessary to establish the representative capacity of the named plaintiffs, unless the named plaintiffs (upon notifying the defendant that they are named plaintiffs in a class action with respect to a warranty obligation) initially resort to such procedure. In the case of such a class action which is brought in a district court of the United States, the representative capacity of the named plaintiffs shall be established in the application of rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In any civil action arising out of a warranty obligation and relating to a matter considered in such a procedure, any decision in such procedure shall be admissible in evidence.
<br>
<br>(4) The Commission on its own initiative may, or upon written complaint filed by any interested person shall, review the bona fide operation of any dispute settlement procedure resort to which is stated in a written warranty to be a prerequisite to pursuing a legal remedy under this section. If the Commission finds that such procedure or its implementation fails to comply with the requirements of the rules under paragraph (2), the Commission may take appropriate remedial action under any authority it may have under this chapter or any other provision of law.
<br>
<br>(5) Until rules under paragraph (2) take effect, this subsection shall not affect the validity of any informal dispute settlement procedure respecting consumer warranties, but in any action under subsection (d), the court may invalidate any such procedure if it finds that such procedure is unfair.
<br>(b) Prohibited acts
<br>
<br>It shall be a violation of section 45(a)(1) of this title for any person to fail to comply with any requirement imposed on such person by this chapter (or a rule thereunder) or to violate any prohibition contained in this chapter (or a rule thereunder).
<br>(c) Injunction proceedings by Attorney General or Commission for deceptive warranty, noncompliance with requirements, or violating prohibitions; procedures; definitions
<br>
<br>(1) The district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction of any action brought by the Attorney General (in his capacity as such), or by the Commission by any of its attorneys designated by it for such purpose, to restrain (A) any warrantor from making a deceptive warranty with respect to a consumer product, or (B) any person from failing to comply with any requirement imposed on such person by or pursuant to this chapter or from violating any prohibition contained in this chapter. Upon proper showing that, weighing the equities and considering the Commission's or Attorney General's likelihood of ultimate success, such action would be in the public interest and after notice to the defendant, a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction may be granted without bond. In the case of an action brought by the Commission, if a complaint under section 45 of this title is not filed within such period (not exceeding 10 days) as may be specified by the court after the issuance of the temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction, the order or injunction shall be dissolved by the court and be of no further force and effect. Any suit shall be brought in the district in which such person resides or transacts business. Whenever it appears to the court that the ends of justice require that other persons should be parties in the action, the court may cause them to be summoned whether or not they reside in the district in which the court is held, and to that end process may be served in any district.
<br>
<br>(2) For the purposes of this subsection, the term "deceptive warranty" means (A) a written warranty which (i) contains an affirmation, promise, description, or representation which is either false or fraudulent, or which, in light of all of the circumstances, would mislead a reasonable individual exercising due care; or (ii) fails to contain information which is necessary in light of all of the circumstances, to make the warranty not misleading to a reasonable individual exercising due care; or (B) a written warranty created by the use of such terms as "guaranty" or "warranty", if the terms and conditions of such warranty so limit its scope and application as to deceive a reasonable individual.
<br>(d) Civil action by consumer for damages, etc.; jurisdiction; recovery of costs and expenses; cognizable claims
<br>
<br>(1) Subject to subsections (a)(3) and (e), a consumer who is damaged by the failure of a supplier, warrantor, or service contractor to comply with any obligation under this chapter, or under a written warranty, implied warranty, or service contract, may bring suit for damages and other legal and equitable relief—
<br>
<br>(A) in any court of competent jurisdiction in any State or the District of Columbia; or
<br>
<br>(B) in an appropriate district court of the United States, subject to paragraph (3) of this subsection.
<br>
<br>(2) If a consumer finally prevails in any action brought under paragraph (1) of this subsection, he may be allowed by the court to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of cost and expenses (including attorneys' fees based on actual time expended) determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the plaintiff for or in connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action, unless the court in its discretion shall determine that such an award of attorneys' fees would be inappropriate.
<br>
<br>(3) No claim shall be cognizable in a suit brought under paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection—
<br>
<br>(A) if the amount in controversy of any individual claim is less than the sum or value of $25;
<br>
<br>(B) if the amount in controversy is less than the sum or value of $50,000 (exclusive of interests and costs) computed on the basis of all claims to be determined in this suit; or
<br>
<br>(C) if the action is brought as a class action, and the number of named plaintiffs is less than one hundred.
<br>(e) Class actions; conditions; procedures applicable
<br>
<br>No action (other than a class action or an action respecting a warranty to which subsection (a)(3) applies) may be brought under subsection (d) for failure to comply with any obligation under any written or implied warranty or service contract, and a class of consumers may not proceed in a class action under such subsection with respect to such a failure except to the extent the court determines necessary to establish the representative capacity of the named plaintiffs, unless the person obligated under the warranty or service contract is afforded a reasonable opportunity to cure such failure to comply. In the case of such a class action (other than a class action respecting a warranty to which subsection (a)(3) applies) brought under subsection (d) for breach of any written or implied warranty or service contract, such reasonable opportunity will be afforded by the named plaintiffs and they shall at that time notify the defendant that they are acting on behalf of the class. In the case of such a class action which is brought in a district court of the United States, the representative capacity of the named plaintiffs shall be established in the application of rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
<br>(f) Warrantors subject to enforcement of remedies
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, only the warrantor actually making a written affirmation of fact, promise, or undertaking shall be deemed to have created a written warranty, and any rights arising thereunder may be enforced under this section only against such warrantor and no other person.

<br>§2311. Applicability to other laws
<br>(a) Federal Trade Commission Act and Federal Seed Act

<br>(1) Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to repeal, invalidate, or supersede the Federal Trade Commission Act [15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.] or any statute defined therein as an Antitrust Act.
<br>
<br>(2) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to repeal, invalidate, or supersede the Federal Seed Act [7 U.S.C. 1551 et seq.] and nothing in this chapter shall apply to seed for planting.

<br>(2) Nothing in this chapter (other than sections 2308 and 2304(a)(2) and (4) of this title) shall (A) affect the liability of, or impose liability on, any person for personal injury, or (B) supersede any provision of State law regarding consequential damages for injury to the person or other injury.
<br>(c) State warranty laws
<br>
<br>(1) Except as provided in subsection (b) and in paragraph (2) of this subsection, a State requirement—
<br>
<br>(A) which relates to labeling or disclosure with respect to written warranties or performance thereunder;
<br>
<br>(B) which is within the scope of an applicable requirement of sections 2302, 2303, and 2304 of this title (and rules implementing such sections), and
<br>
<br>(C) which is not identical to a requirement of section 2302, 2303, or 2304 of this title (or a rule thereunder),
<br>
<br>shall not be applicable to written warranties complying with such sections (or rules thereunder).
<br>
<br>(2) If, upon application of an appropriate State agency, the Commission determines (pursuant to rules issued in accordance with section 2309 of this title) that any requirement of such State covering any transaction to which this chapter applies (A) affords protection to consumers greater than the requirements of this chapter and (B) does not unduly burden interstate commerce, then such State requirement shall be applicable (notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection) to the extent specified in such determination for so long as the State administers and enforces effectively any such greater requirement.
<br>(d) Other Federal warranty laws
<br>
<br>This chapter (other than section 2302(c) of this title) shall be inapplicable to any written warranty the making or content of which is otherwise governed by Federal law.

<br>SUBCHAPTER I—FINDINGS, PURPOSE, AND POLICY; DEFINITIONS
<br>§2401. Congressional findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) the rate of productivity growth in the United States has declined during four of the past six years;
<br>
<br>(2) the decline in the rate of productivity growth has contributed to inflation, to economic stagnation, and to increasing unemployment;
<br>
<br>(3) since 1965, the rate of productivity growth of the United States has been consistently lower than that of many industrial nations in the world, adversely affecting the competitive position of the United States in world markets;
<br>
<br>(4) growth in productivity of the economy of the United States is essential to the social and economic welfare of the American people, and to the health of the world economy;
<br>
<br>(5) growth in the productivity of the Nation's economy is essential to maintain and increase employment, to stabilize the cost of living and to provide job security;
<br>
<br>(6) mounting worldwide material shortages and their consequent inflationary results make increased efficiency in the utilization of these resources of urgent importance;
<br>
<br>(7) sharing the fruits of productivity gains among labor, management, and owners may considerably influence productivity;
<br>
<br>(8) the continued development of joint labor-management efforts to provide a healthy environment for collective bargaining can make a significant contribution to improve productivity and foster industrial peace;
<br>
<br>(9) factors affecting the growth of productivity in the economy include not only the status of technology and the techniques of management but also the role of the worker in the production process and the conditions of his working life;
<br>
<br>(10) there is a national need to identify and encourage appropriate application of capital in sectors of American economic activity in order to improve productivity;
<br>
<br>(11) there is a national need to identify and encourage appropriate application of technology in all sectors of American economic activity in order to improve productivity;
<br>
<br>(12) there is a national need to identify and encourage the development of social, economic, scientific, business, labor, and governmental contributions to improve productivity growth, and increased economic effectiveness in the public and private sectors of the United States; which objectives can best be accomplished through maximizing private sector and State and local development of such contributions;
<br>
<br>(13) there is a national need to identify, study, and revise or eliminate the laws, regulations, policies, and procedures which adversely affect productivity growth and the efficient functioning of the economy;
<br>
<br>(14) there is a national need to increase employment security through such activities as manpower planning, skill-training and retraining of workers, internal work force adjustments to avoid worker displacement, assistance to workers facing or experiencing displacement, and all other public and private programs which seek to minimize the human costs of productivity improvement, thereby diminishing resistance to workplace change and improving productivity growth;
<br>
<br>(15) there is a national need to develop new technologies for the more effective production of goods and services;
<br>
<br>(16) there is a national need to encourage and support efforts by qualified institutions of higher learning to identify and inaugurate programs which will improve productivity;
<br>
<br>(17) there is a national need to develop precise, standardized measurements of productivity; and
<br>
<br>(18) there is a national need to gather and disseminate information about methods and techniques to improve productivity.

<br>§2501. Congressional findings and policy
<br>
<br>(a) The Congress finds and declares that—
<br>
<br>(1) the Nation's dependence on foreign sources of petroleum must be reduced, as such dependence jeopardizes national security, inhibits foreign policy, and undermines economic well-being;
<br>
<br>(2) the Nation's balance of payments is threatened by the need to import oil for the production of liquid fuel for gasoline-powered vehicles;
<br>
<br>(3) the single largest use of petroleum supplies is in the field of transportation, for gasoline- and diesel-powered motor vehicles;
<br>
<br>(4) the expeditious introduction of electric and hybrid vehicles into the Nation's transportation fleet would substantially reduce such use and dependence;
<br>
<br>(5) such introduction is practicable and would be advantageous because—
<br>
<br>(A) most urban driving consists of short trips, which are within the capability of electric and hybrid vehicles;
<br>
<br>(B) much rural and agricultural driving of automobiles, tractors, and trucks is within the capability of such vehicles;
<br>
<br>(C) electric and hybrid vehicles are more reliable and practical now than in the past because propulsion, control, and battery technologies have improved, and further significant improvements in such technologies are possible in the near term;
<br>
<br>(D) electric and hybrid vehicles use little or no energy when stopped in traffic, in contrast to conventional automobiles and trucks;
<br>
<br>(E) the power requirements of such vehicles could be satisfied by charging them during off-peak periods when existing electric generating plants are underutilized, thereby permitting more efficient use of existing generating capacity;
<br>
<br>(F) such vehicles do not emit any significant pollutants or noise; and
<br>
<br>(G) it is environmentally desirable for transportation systems to be powered from central sources, because pollutants emitted from stationary sources (such as electric generating plants) are potentially easier to control than pollutants emitted from moving vehicles; and
<br>
<br>(6) the introduction of electric and hybrid vehicles would be facilitated by the establishment of a Federal program of research, development, and demonstration to explore electric and hybrid vehicle technologies.
<br>
<br>(b) It is therefore declared to be the policy of the Congress in this chapter to—
<br>
<br>(1) encourage and support accelerated research into, and development of, electric and hybrid vehicle technologies;
<br>
<br>(2) demonstrate the economic and technological practicability of electric and hybrid vehicles for personal and commercial use in urban areas and for agricultural and personal use in rural areas;
<br>
<br>(3) facilitate, and remove barriers to, the use of electric and hybrid vehicles in lieu of gasoline- and diesel-powered motor vehicles, where practicable; and
<br>
<br>(4) promote the substitution of electric and hybrid vehicles for many gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles currently used in routine short-haul, low-load applications, where such substitution would be beneficial.

<br>
<br>(1) Omitted
<br>
<br>(2) "advanced electric or hybrid vehicle" means a vehicle which—
<br>
<br>(A) minimizes the total amount of energy to be consumed with respect to its fabrication, operation, and disposal, and represents a substantial improvement over existing electric and hybrid vehicles with respect to the total amount of energy so consumed;
<br>
<br>(B) is capable of being mass-produced and operated at a cost and in a manner which is sufficiently competitive to enable it to be produced and sold in numbers representing a reasonable portion of the market;
<br>
<br>(C) is safe, damage-resistant, easy to repair, durable, and operates with sufficient performance with respect to acceleration, cold-weather starting, cruising speed, and other performance factors; and
<br>
<br>(D) at a minimum, can be produced, distributed, operated, and disposed of in compliance with any applicable requirement of Federal law;
<br>
<br>(3) "commercial electric or hybrid vehicle" includes any electric or hybrid vehicle which can be used (A) for business or agricultural production purposes on farms (e.g. tractors and trucks) or in rural areas, or (B) for commercial purposes in urban areas;
