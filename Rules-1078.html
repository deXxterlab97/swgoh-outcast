<br>

<br>

<br>
<br>(E) In determining the primary mode of action of a combination product, the Secretary shall not determine that the primary mode of action is that of a drug or biological product solely because the combination product has any chemical action within or on the human body.
<br>
<br>(F) If a sponsor of a combination product disagrees with the determination under subparagraph (D)—
<br>
<br>(i) such sponsor may request, and the Secretary shall provide, a substantive rationale to such sponsor that references scientific evidence provided by the sponsor and any other scientific evidence relied upon by the Secretary to support such determination; and
<br>
<br>(ii)(I) the sponsor of the combination product may propose one or more studies (which may be nonclinical, clinical, or both) to establish the relevance, if any, of the chemical action in achieving the primary mode of action of such product;
<br>
<br>(II) if the sponsor proposes any such studies, the Secretary and the sponsor of such product shall collaborate and seek to reach agreement, within a reasonable time of such proposal, not to exceed 90 calendar days, on the design of such studies; and
<br>
<br>(III) if an agreement is reached under subclause (II) and the sponsor conducts one or more of such studies, the Secretary shall consider the data resulting from any such study when reevaluating the determination of the primary mode of action of such product, and unless and until such reevaluation has occurred and the Secretary issues a new determination, the determination of the Secretary under subparagraph (D) shall remain in effect.

<br>
<br>(iii) Any agreement under this subparagraph shall be in writing and made part of the administrative record by the Secretary.
<br>

<br>(II) pursuant to a decision by the director of the reviewing division of the primary agency center, or a person more senior than such director, in consultation with consulting centers and the Office, as appropriate, that an issue essential to determining whether the standard for market clearance or other applicable standard under this chapter or the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.] applicable to the combination product has been identified since the agreement was reached, or that deviating from the agreement is otherwise justifiable based on scientific evidence, for public health reasons.
<br>

<br>
<br>(A) a drug constituent part of a combination product being reviewed in a single application or request under section 360e, 360(k), or 360c(f)(2) of this title (submitted in accordance with paragraph (5)), that is an approved drug, provided such application or request complies with paragraph (5);

<br>
<br>(5)(A) If an application is submitted under section 360e or 360(k) of this title or a request is submitted under section 360c(f)(2) of this title, consistent with any determination made under paragraph (1)(D), for a combination product containing as a constituent part an approved drug—
<br>
<br>(i) the application or request shall include the certification or statement described in section 355(b)(2) of this title; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the applicant or requester shall provide notice as described in section 355(b)(3) of this title.

<br>
<br>(6) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as prohibiting a sponsor from submitting separate applications for the constituent parts of a combination product, unless the Secretary determines that a single application is necessary.

<br>
<br>Pub. L. 104–180, title VI, §601, Aug. 6, 1996, 110 Stat. 1593, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(a) In General.—Not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act [Aug. 6, 1996], the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services shall request that national organizations representing health care professionals, consumer organizations, voluntary health agencies, the pharmaceutical industry, drug wholesalers, patient drug information database companies, and other relevant parties collaborate to develop a long-range comprehensive action plan to achieve goals consistent with the goals of the proposed rule of the Food and Drug Administration on 'Prescription Drug Product Labeling: Medication Guide Requirements' (60 Fed. Reg. 44182; relating to the provision of oral and written prescription information to consumers).
<br>
<br>"(b) Goals.—Goals consistent with the proposed rule described in subsection (a) are the distribution of useful written information to 75 percent of individuals receiving new precriptions [sic] by the year 2000 and to 95 percent by the year 2006.
<br>
<br>"(c) Plan.—The plan described in subsection (a) shall—
<br>
<br>"(1) identify the plan goals;
<br>
<br>"(2) assess the effectiveness of the current private-sector approaches used to provide oral and written prescription information to consumers;
<br>
<br>"(3) develop guidelines for providing effective oral and written prescription information consistent with the findings of any such assessment;
<br>
<br>"(4) contain elements necessary to ensure the transmittal of useful information to the consuming public, including being scientifically accurate, non-promotional in tone and content, sufficiently specific and comprehensive as to adequately inform consumers about the use of the product, and in an understandable, legible format that is readily comprehensible and not confusing to consumers expected to use the product.[;]
<br>
<br>"(5) develop a mechanism to assess periodically the quality of the oral and written prescription information and the frequency with which the information is provided to consumers; and
<br>
<br>"(6) provide for compliance with relevant State board regulations.
<br>
<br>"(d) Limitation on the Authority of the Secretary.—The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services shall have no authority to implement the proposed rule described in subsection (a), or to develop any similar regulation, policy statement, or other guideline specifying a uniform content or format for written information voluntarily provided to consumers about prescription drugs if, (1) not later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this Act [Aug. 6, 1996], the national organizations described in subsection (a) develop and submit to the Secretary for Health and Human Services a comprehensive, long-range action plan (as described in subsection (a)) which shall be acceptable to the Secretary of Health and Human Services; (2) the aforementioned plan is submitted to the Secretary of Health and Human Services for review and acceptance: Provided, That the Secretary shall give due consideration to the submitted plan and that any such acceptance shall not be arbitrarily withheld; and (3) the implementation of (a) a plan accepted by the Secretary commences within 30 days of the Secretary's acceptance of such plan, or (b) the plan submitted to the Secretary commences within 60 days of the submission of such plan if the Secretary fails to take any action on the plan within 30 days of the submission of the plan.

<br>Congressional Findings
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 100–293, §2, Apr. 22, 1988, 102 Stat. 95, provided that: "The Congress finds the following:
<br>
<br>"(1) American consumers cannot purchase prescription drugs with the certainty that the products are safe and effective.
<br>
<br>"(2) The integrity of the distribution system for prescription drugs is insufficient to prevent the introduction and eventual retail sale of substandard, ineffective, or even counterfeit drugs.
<br>
<br>"(3) The existence and operation of a wholesale submarket, commonly known as the 'diversion market', prevents effective control over or even routine knowledge of the true sources of prescription drugs in a significant number of cases.
<br>
<br>"(4) Large amounts of drugs are being reimported to the United States as American goods returned. These imports are a health and safety risk to American consumers because they may have become subpotent or adulterated during foreign handling and shipping.
<br>
<br>"(5) The ready market for prescription drug reimports has been the catalyst for a continuing series of frauds against American manufacturers and has provided the cover for the importation of foreign counterfeit drugs.
<br>
<br>"(6) The existing system of providing drug samples to physicians through manufacturer's representatives has been abused for decades and has resulted in the sale to consumers of misbranded, expired, and adulterated pharmaceuticals.
<br>
<br>"(7) The bulk resale of below wholesale priced prescription drugs by health care entities, for ultimate sale at retail, helps fuel the diversion market and is an unfair form of competition to wholesalers and retailers that must pay otherwise prevailing market prices.
<br>
<br>"(8) The effect of these several practices and conditions is to create an unacceptable risk that counterfeit, adulterated, misbranded, subpotent, or expired drugs will be sold to American consumers."
<br>
<br>1 So in original. No subpar. (B) has been enacted.
<br>
<br>2 So in original. The word "and" probably should appear.
<br>
<br>3 So in original. The semicolon probably should be a period.

<br>§353a. Pharmacy compounding
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>Sections 351(a)(2)(B), 352(f)(1), and 355 of this title shall not apply to a drug product if the drug product is compounded for an identified individual patient based on the receipt of a valid prescription order or a notation, approved by the prescribing practitioner, on the prescription order that a compounded product is necessary for the identified patient, if the drug product meets the requirements of this section, and if the compounding—
<br>
<br>(1) is by—
<br>
<br>(A) a licensed pharmacist in a State licensed pharmacy or a Federal facility, or
<br>
<br>(B) a licensed physician,
<br>
<br>on the prescription order for such individual patient made by a licensed physician or other licensed practitioner authorized by State law to prescribe drugs; or
<br>
<br>(2)(A) is by a licensed pharmacist or licensed physician in limited quantities before the receipt of a valid prescription order for such individual patient; and
<br>
<br>(B) is based on a history of the licensed pharmacist or licensed physician receiving valid prescription orders for the compounding of the drug product, which orders have been generated solely within an established relationship between—
<br>
<br>(i) the licensed pharmacist or licensed physician; and
<br>
<br>(ii)(I) such individual patient for whom the prescription order will be provided; or
<br>
<br>(II) the physician or other licensed practitioner who will write such prescription order.
<br>(b) Compounded drug
<br>(1) Licensed pharmacist and licensed physician
<br>
<br>A drug product may be compounded under subsection (a) if the licensed pharmacist or licensed physician—
<br>
<br>(A) compounds the drug product using bulk drug substances, as defined in regulations of the Secretary published at section 207.3(a)(4) of title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations—
<br>
<br>(i) that—
<br>
<br>(I) comply with the standards of an applicable United States Pharmacopoeia or National Formulary monograph, if a monograph exists, and the United States Pharmacopoeia chapter on pharmacy compounding;
<br>
<br>(II) if such a monograph does not exist, are drug substances that are components of drugs approved by the Secretary; or
<br>
<br>(III) if such a monograph does not exist and the drug substance is not a component of a drug approved by the Secretary, that appear on a list developed by the Secretary through regulations issued by the Secretary under subsection (c);
<br>
<br>(ii) that are manufactured by an establishment that is registered under section 360 of this title (including a foreign establishment that is registered under section 360(i) of this title); and
<br>
<br>(iii) that are accompanied by valid certificates of analysis for each bulk drug substance;
<br>
<br>(B) compounds the drug product using ingredients (other than bulk drug substances) that comply with the standards of an applicable United States Pharmacopoeia or National Formulary monograph, if a monograph exists, and the United States Pharmacopoeia chapter on pharmacy compounding;
<br>
<br>(C) does not compound a drug product that appears on a list published by the Secretary in the Federal Register of drug products that have been withdrawn or removed from the market because such drug products or components of such drug products have been found to be unsafe or not effective; and
<br>
<br>(D) does not compound regularly or in inordinate amounts (as defined by the Secretary) any drug products that are essentially copies of a commercially available drug product.
<br>(2) Definition
<br>
<br>For purposes of paragraph (1)(D), the term "essentially a copy of a commercially available drug product" does not include a drug product in which there is a change, made for an identified individual patient, which produces for that patient a significant difference, as determined by the prescribing practitioner, between the compounded drug and the comparable commercially available drug product.
<br>(3) Drug product
<br>
<br>A drug product may be compounded under subsection (a) only if—
<br>
<br>(A) such drug product is not a drug product identified by the Secretary by regulation as a drug product that presents demonstrable difficulties for compounding that reasonably demonstrate an adverse effect on the safety or effectiveness of that drug product; and
<br>
<br>(B) such drug product is compounded in a State—
<br>
<br>(i) that has entered into a memorandum of understanding with the Secretary which addresses the distribution of inordinate amounts of compounded drug products interstate and provides for appropriate investigation by a State agency of complaints relating to compounded drug products distributed outside such State; or
<br>
<br>(ii) that has not entered into the memorandum of understanding described in clause (i) and the licensed pharmacist, licensed pharmacy, or licensed physician distributes (or causes to be distributed) compounded drug products out of the State in which they are compounded in quantities that do not exceed 5 percent of the total prescription orders dispensed or distributed by such pharmacy or physician.
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall, in consultation with the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, develop a standard memorandum of understanding for use by the States in complying with subparagraph (B)(i).
<br>(c) Regulations
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall issue regulations to implement this section. Before issuing regulations to implement subsections (b)(1)(A)(i)(III), (b)(1)(C), or (b)(3)(A), the Secretary shall convene and consult an advisory committee on compounding unless the Secretary determines that the issuance of such regulations before consultation is necessary to protect the public health. The advisory committee shall include representatives from the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, the United States Pharmacopoeia, pharmacy, physician, and consumer organizations, and other experts selected by the Secretary.
<br>(2) Limiting compounding
<br>
<br>The Secretary, in consultation with the United States Pharmacopoeia Convention, Incorporated, shall promulgate regulations identifying drug substances that may be used in compounding under subsection (b)(1)(A)(i)(III) for which a monograph does not exist or which are not components of drug products approved by the Secretary. The Secretary shall include in the regulation the criteria for such substances, which shall include historical use, reports in peer reviewed medical literature, or other criteria the Secretary may identify.
<br>(d) Application
<br>
<br>This section shall not apply to—
<br>
<br>(1) compounded positron emission tomography drugs as defined in section 321(ii) of this title; or
<br>
<br>(2) radiopharmaceuticals.
<br>(e) "Compounding" defined
<br>
<br>As used in this section, the term "compounding" does not include mixing, reconstituting, or other such acts that are performed in accordance with directions contained in approved labeling provided by the product's manufacturer and other manufacturer directions consistent with that labeling.
