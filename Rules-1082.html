<br>An eligible product developer may bring a civil action against the license holder for a covered product seeking relief under this subsection in an appropriate district court of the United States alleging that the license holder has declined to provide sufficient quantities of the covered product to the eligible product developer on commercially reasonable, market-based terms.
<br>(2) Elements
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>To prevail in a civil action brought under paragraph (1), an eligible product developer shall prove, by a preponderance of the evidence—
<br>
<br>(i) that—
<br>
<br>(I) the covered product is not subject to a REMS with ETASU; or
<br>
<br>(II) if the covered product is subject to a REMS with ETASU—
<br>
<br>(aa) the eligible product developer has obtained a covered product authorization from the Secretary in accordance with subparagraph (B); and
<br>
<br>(bb) the eligible product developer has provided a copy of the covered product authorization to the license holder;
<br>
<br>(ii) that, as of the date on which the civil action is filed, the eligible product developer has not obtained sufficient quantities of the covered product on commercially reasonable, market-based terms;
<br>
<br>(iii) that the eligible product developer has submitted a written request to purchase sufficient quantities of the covered product to the license holder, and such request—
<br>
<br>(I) was sent to a named corporate officer of the license holder;
<br>
<br>(II) was made by certified or registered mail with return receipt requested;
<br>
<br>(III) specified an individual as the point of contact for the license holder to direct communications related to the sale of the covered product to the eligible product developer and a means for electronic and written communications with that individual; and
<br>
<br>(IV) specified an address to which the covered product was to be shipped upon reaching an agreement to transfer the covered product; and
<br>
<br>(iv) that the license holder has not delivered to the eligible product developer sufficient quantities of the covered product on commercially reasonable, market-based terms—
<br>
<br>(I) for a covered product that is not subject to a REMS with ETASU, by the date that is 31 days after the date on which the license holder received the request for the covered product; and
<br>
<br>(II) for a covered product that is subject to a REMS with ETASU, by 31 days after the later of—
<br>
<br>(aa) the date on which the license holder received the request for the covered product; or
<br>
<br>(bb) the date on which the license holder received a copy of the covered product authorization issued by the Secretary in accordance with subparagraph (B).
<br>(B) Authorization for covered product subject to a REMS with ETASU
<br>(i) Request
<br>
<br>An eligible product developer may submit to the Secretary a written request for the eligible product developer to be authorized to obtain sufficient quantities of an individual covered product subject to a REMS with ETASU.
<br>(ii) Authorization
<br>
<br>Not later than 120 days after the date on which a request under clause (i) is received, the Secretary shall, by written notice, authorize the eligible product developer to obtain sufficient quantities of an individual covered product subject to a REMS with ETASU for purposes of—
<br>
<br>(I) development and testing that does not involve human clinical trials, if the eligible product developer has agreed to comply with any conditions the Secretary determines necessary; or
<br>
<br>(II) development and testing that involves human clinical trials, if the eligible product developer has—
<br>
<br>(aa)(AA) submitted protocols, informed consent documents, and informational materials for testing that include protections that provide safety protections comparable to those provided by the REMS for the covered product; or
<br>
<br>(BB) otherwise satisfied the Secretary that such protections will be provided; and
<br>
<br>(bb) met any other requirements the Secretary may establish.
<br>(iii) Notice
<br>
<br>A covered product authorization issued under this subparagraph shall state that the provision of the covered product by the license holder under the terms of the authorization will not be a violation of the REMS for the covered product.
<br>(3) Affirmative defense
<br>
<br>In a civil action brought under paragraph (1), it shall be an affirmative defense, on which the defendant has the burden of persuasion by a preponderance of the evidence—
<br>
<br>(A) that, on the date on which the eligible product developer requested to purchase sufficient quantities of the covered product from the license holder—
<br>
<br>(i) neither the license holder nor any of its agents, wholesalers, or distributors was engaged in the manufacturing or commercial marketing of the covered product; and
<br>
<br>(ii) neither the license holder nor any of its agents, wholesalers, or distributors otherwise had access to inventory of the covered product to supply to the eligible product developer on commercially reasonable, market-based terms;
<br>
<br>(B) that—
<br>

<br>
<br>(iii) the covered product can be purchased by the eligible product developer in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable, market-based terms from the agents, distributors, or wholesalers of the license holder; or
<br>
<br>(C) that the license holder made an offer to the individual specified pursuant to paragraph (2)(A)(iii)(III), by a means of communication (electronic, written, or both) specified pursuant to such paragraph, to sell sufficient quantities of the covered product to the eligible product developer at commercially reasonable market-based terms—
<br>
<br>(i) for a covered product that is not subject to a REMS with ETASU, by the date that is 14 days after the date on which the license holder received the request for the covered product, and the eligible product developer did not accept such offer by the date that is 7 days after the date on which the eligible product developer received such offer from the license holder; or
<br>
<br>(ii) for a covered product that is subject to a REMS with ETASU, by the date that is 20 days after the date on which the license holder received the request for the covered product, and the eligible product developer did not accept such offer by the date that is 10 days after the date on which the eligible product developer received such offer from the license holder.
<br>(4) Remedies
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>If an eligible product developer prevails in a civil action brought under paragraph (1), the court shall—
<br>
<br>(i) order the license holder to provide to the eligible product developer without delay sufficient quantities of the covered product on commercially reasonable, market-based terms;
<br>
<br>(ii) award to the eligible product developer reasonable attorney's fees and costs of the civil action; and
<br>
<br>(iii) award to the eligible product developer a monetary amount sufficient to deter the license holder from failing to provide eligible product developers with sufficient quantities of a covered product on commercially reasonable, market-based terms, if the court finds, by a preponderance of the evidence—
<br>
<br>(I) that the license holder delayed providing sufficient quantities of the covered product to the eligible product developer without a legitimate business justification; or
<br>
<br>(II) that the license holder failed to comply with an order issued under clause (i).
<br>(B) Maximum monetary amount
<br>
<br>A monetary amount awarded under subparagraph (A)(iii) shall not be greater than the revenue that the license holder earned on the covered product during the period—
<br>
<br>(i) beginning on—
<br>
<br>(I) for a covered product that is not subject to a REMS with ETASU, the date that is 31 days after the date on which the license holder received the request; or
<br>
<br>(II) for a covered product that is subject to a REMS with ETASU, the date that is 31 days after the later of—
<br>
<br>(aa) the date on which the license holder received the request; or
<br>
<br>(bb) the date on which the license holder received a copy of the covered product authorization issued by the Secretary in accordance with paragraph (2)(B); and
<br>
<br>(ii) ending on the date on which the eligible product developer received sufficient quantities of the covered product.
<br>(C) Avoidance of delay
<br>
<br>The court may issue an order under subparagraph (A)(i) before conducting further proceedings that may be necessary to determine whether the eligible product developer is entitled to an award under clause (ii) or (iii) of subparagraph (A), or the amount of any such award.
<br>(c) Limitation of liability
<br>
<br>A license holder for a covered product shall not be liable for any claim under Federal, State, or local law arising out of the failure of an eligible product developer to follow adequate safeguards to assure safe use of the covered product during development or testing activities described in this section, including transportation, handling, use, or disposal of the covered product by the eligible product developer.

<br>
<br>(A) the availability or scope of exclusivity under—
<br>
<br>(i) this section;
<br>

<br>
<br>(C) the question of the eligibility for approval under section 355 of this title of any application described in subsection (b)(2) or (j) of such section that omits any other aspect of labeling protected by exclusivity under—
<br>
<br>(i) clause (iii) or (iv) of section 355(j)(5)(F) of this title;

<br>§355c. Research into pediatric uses for drugs and biological products
<br>(a) New drugs and biological products
<br>(1) In general
<br>(A) General requirements
<br>
<br>Except with respect to an application for which subparagraph (B) applies, a person that submits, on or after September 27, 2007, an application (or supplement to an application) for a drug—
<br>
<br>(i) under section 355 of this title for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen, or new route of administration; or
<br>
<br>(ii) under section 262 of title 42 for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen, or new route of administration,
<br>
<br>shall submit with the application the assessments described in paragraph (2).
<br>(B) Certain molecularly targeted cancer indications
<br>
<br>A person that submits, on or after the date that is 3 years after August 18, 2017, an original application for a new active ingredient under section 355 of this title or section 262 of title 42, shall submit with the application reports on the investigation described in paragraph (3) if the drug or biological product that is the subject of the application is—
<br>
<br>(i) intended for the treatment of an adult cancer; and
<br>
<br>(ii) directed at a molecular target that the Secretary determines to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer.
<br>(2) Assessments
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The assessments referred to in paragraph (1)(A) shall contain data, gathered using appropriate formulations for each age group for which the assessment is required, that are adequate—
<br>
<br>(i) to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug or the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations; and
<br>
<br>(ii) to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug or the biological product is safe and effective.
<br>(B) Similar course of disease or similar effect of drug or biological product
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>If the course of the disease and the effects of the drug are sufficiently similar in adults and pediatric patients, the Secretary may conclude that pediatric effectiveness can be extrapolated from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults, usually supplemented with other information obtained in pediatric patients, such as pharmacokinetic studies.
<br>(ii) Extrapolation between age groups
<br>
<br>A study may not be needed in each pediatric age group if data from one age group can be extrapolated to another age group.
<br>(iii) Information on extrapolation
<br>
<br>A brief documentation of the scientific data supporting the conclusion under clauses (i) and (ii) shall be included in any pertinent reviews for the application under section 355 of this title or section 262 of title 42.
<br>(3) Molecularly targeted pediatric cancer investigation
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>With respect to a drug or biological product described in paragraph (1)(B), the investigation described in this paragraph is a molecularly targeted pediatric cancer investigation, which shall be designed to yield clinically meaningful pediatric study data, gathered using appropriate formulations for each age group for which the study is required, regarding dosing, safety, and preliminary efficacy to inform potential pediatric labeling.
<br>(B) Extrapolation of data
<br>
<br>Paragraph (2)(B) shall apply to investigations described in this paragraph to the same extent and in the same manner as paragraph (2)(B) applies with respect to the assessments required under paragraph (1)(A).
<br>(C) Deferrals and waivers
<br>
<br>Deferrals and waivers under paragraphs (4) and (5) shall apply to investigations described in this paragraph to the same extent and in the same manner as such deferrals and waivers apply with respect to the assessments under paragraph (2)(B).
<br>(4) Deferral
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>On the initiative of the Secretary or at the request of the applicant, the Secretary may defer submission of some or all assessments required under paragraph (1)(A) or reports on the investigation required under paragraph (1)(B) until a specified date after approval of the drug or issuance of the license for a biological product if—
<br>
<br>(i) the Secretary finds that—
<br>
<br>(I) the drug or biological product is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric studies are complete;
<br>
<br>(II) pediatric studies should be delayed until additional safety or effectiveness data have been collected; or
<br>
<br>(III) there is another appropriate reason for deferral; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the applicant submits to the Secretary—
<br>
<br>(I) certification of the grounds for deferring the assessments or reports on the investigation;
<br>
<br>(II) a pediatric study plan as described in subsection (e);
<br>
<br>(III) evidence that the studies are being conducted or will be conducted with due diligence and at the earliest possible time; and
<br>
<br>(IV) a timeline for the completion of such studies.
<br>(B) Deferral extension
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>On the initiative of the Secretary or at the request of the applicant, the Secretary may grant an extension of a deferral approved under subparagraph (A) for submission of some or all assessments required under paragraph (1)(A) or reports on the investigation required under paragraph (1)(B) if—
<br>
<br>(I) the Secretary determines that the conditions described in subclause (II) or (III) of subparagraph (A)(i) continue to be met; and
<br>
<br>(II) the applicant submits a new timeline under subparagraph (A)(ii)(IV) and any significant updates to the information required under subparagraph (A)(ii).
<br>(ii) Timing and information
<br>
<br>If the deferral extension under this subparagraph is requested by the applicant, the applicant shall submit the deferral extension request containing the information described in this subparagraph not less than 90 days prior to the date that the deferral would expire. The Secretary shall respond to such request not later than 45 days after the receipt of such letter. If the Secretary grants such an extension, the specified date shall be the extended date. The sponsor of the required assessment under paragraph (1)(A) or reports on the investigation under paragraph (1)(B) shall not be issued a letter described in subsection (d) unless the specified or extended date of submission for such required studies has passed or if the request for an extension is pending. For a deferral that has expired prior to July 9, 2012, or that will expire prior to 270 days after July 9, 2012, a deferral extension shall be requested by an applicant not later than 180 days after July 9, 2012. The Secretary shall respond to any such request as soon as practicable, but not later than 1 year after July 9, 2012. Nothing in this clause shall prevent the Secretary from updating the status of a study or studies publicly if components of such study or studies are late or delayed.
<br>(C) Annual review
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>On an annual basis following the approval of a deferral under subparagraph (A), the applicant shall submit to the Secretary the following information:
<br>
<br>(I) Information detailing the progress made in conducting pediatric studies.
<br>
<br>(II) If no progress has been made in conducting such studies, evidence and documentation that such studies will be conducted with due diligence and at the earliest possible time.
<br>
<br>(III) Projected completion date for pediatric studies.
<br>
<br>(IV) The reason or reasons why a deferral or deferral extension continues to be necessary.
<br>(ii) Public availability
<br>
<br>Not later than 90 days after the submission to the Secretary of the information submitted through the annual review under clause (i), the Secretary shall make available to the public in an easily accessible manner, including through the Internet Web site of the Food and Drug Administration—
<br>
<br>(I) such information;
<br>
<br>(II) the name of the applicant for the product subject to the assessment or investigation;
<br>
<br>(III) the date on which the product was approved; and
<br>
<br>(IV) the date of each deferral or deferral extension under this paragraph for the product.
<br>(5) Waivers
<br>(A) Full waiver
<br>
<br>On the initiative of the Secretary or at the request of an applicant, the Secretary shall grant a full waiver, as appropriate, of the requirement to submit assessments or reports on the investigation for a drug or biological product under this subsection if the applicant certifies and the Secretary finds that—
<br>
<br>(i) necessary studies are impossible or highly impracticable (because, for example, the number of patients is so small or the patients are geographically dispersed);
<br>
<br>(ii) there is evidence strongly suggesting that the drug or biological product would be ineffective or unsafe in all pediatric age groups; or
<br>
<br>(iii) the drug or biological product—
<br>
<br>(I) does not represent a meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing therapies for pediatric patients; and
<br>
<br>(II) is not likely to be used in a substantial number of pediatric patients.
<br>(B) Partial waiver
<br>
<br>On the initiative of the Secretary or at the request of an applicant, the Secretary shall grant a partial waiver, as appropriate, of the requirement to submit assessments or reports on the investigation for a drug or biological product under this subsection with respect to a specific pediatric age group if the applicant certifies and the Secretary finds that—
<br>
<br>(i) necessary studies are impossible or highly impracticable (because, for example, the number of patients in that age group is so small or patients in that age group are geographically dispersed);
<br>
<br>(ii) there is evidence strongly suggesting that the drug or biological product would be ineffective or unsafe in that age group;
<br>
<br>(iii) the drug or biological product—
<br>
<br>(I) does not represent a meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing therapies for pediatric patients in that age group; and
<br>
<br>(II) is not likely to be used by a substantial number of pediatric patients in that age group; or
<br>
<br>(iv) the applicant can demonstrate that reasonable attempts to produce a pediatric formulation necessary for that age group have failed.
<br>(C) Pediatric formulation not possible
<br>
<br>If a partial waiver is granted on the ground that it is not possible to develop a pediatric formulation, the waiver shall cover only the pediatric groups requiring that formulation. An applicant seeking such a partial waiver shall submit to the Secretary documentation detailing why a pediatric formulation cannot be developed and, if the waiver is granted, the applicant's submission shall promptly be made available to the public in an easily accessible manner, including through posting on the Web site of the Food and Drug Administration.
<br>(D) Labeling requirement
<br>
<br>If the Secretary grants a full or partial waiver because there is evidence that a drug or biological product would be ineffective or unsafe in pediatric populations, the information shall be included in the labeling for the drug or biological product.
<br>(b) Marketed drugs and biological products
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary may (by order in the form of a letter) require the sponsor or holder of an approved application for a drug under section 355 of this title or the holder of a license for a biological product under section 262 of title 42 to submit by a specified date the assessments described in subsection (a)(2), if the Secretary finds that—
<br>
<br>(A)(i) the drug or biological product is used for a substantial number of pediatric patients for the labeled indications; and
<br>
<br>(ii) adequate pediatric labeling could confer a benefit on pediatric patients;
<br>
<br>(B) there is reason to believe that the drug or biological product would represent a meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing therapies for pediatric patients for 1 or more of the claimed indications; or
<br>
<br>(C) the absence of adequate pediatric labeling could pose a risk to pediatric patients.
<br>(2) Waivers
<br>(A) Full waiver
<br>
<br>At the request of an applicant, the Secretary shall grant a full waiver, as appropriate, of the requirement to submit assessments under this subsection if the applicant certifies and the Secretary finds that—
<br>
<br>(i) necessary studies are impossible or highly impracticable (because, for example, the number of patients in that age group is so small or patients in that age group are geographically dispersed); or
<br>
<br>(ii) there is evidence strongly suggesting that the drug or biological product would be ineffective or unsafe in all pediatric age groups.
<br>(B) Partial waiver
<br>
<br>At the request of an applicant, the Secretary shall grant a partial waiver, as appropriate, of the requirement to submit assessments under this subsection with respect to a specific pediatric age group if the applicant certifies and the Secretary finds that—
<br>
<br>(i) necessary studies are impossible or highly impracticable (because, for example, the number of patients in that age group is so small or patients in that age group are geographically dispersed);
<br>
<br>(ii) there is evidence strongly suggesting that the drug or biological product would be ineffective or unsafe in that age group;
<br>
<br>(iii)(I) the drug or biological product—
<br>
<br>(aa) does not represent a meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing therapies for pediatric patients in that age group; and
<br>
<br>(bb) is not likely to be used in a substantial number of pediatric patients in that age group; and
<br>
<br>(II) the absence of adequate labeling could not pose significant risks to pediatric patients; or
<br>
<br>(iv) the applicant can demonstrate that reasonable attempts to produce a pediatric formulation necessary for that age group have failed.
<br>(C) Pediatric formulation not possible
<br>
<br>If a waiver is granted on the ground that it is not possible to develop a pediatric formulation, the waiver shall cover only the pediatric groups requiring that formulation. An applicant seeking either a full or partial waiver shall submit to the Secretary documentation detailing why a pediatric formulation cannot be developed and, if the waiver is granted, the applicant's submission shall promptly be made available to the public in an easily accessible manner, including through posting on the Web site of the Food and Drug Administration.
<br>(D) Labeling requirement
<br>
<br>If the Secretary grants a full or partial waiver because there is evidence that a drug or biological product would be ineffective or unsafe in pediatric populations, the information shall be included in the labeling for the drug or biological product.
<br>(3) Effect of subsection
<br>
<br>Nothing in this subsection alters or amends section 331(j) of this title or section 552 of title 5 or section 1905 of title 18.
<br>(c) Meaningful therapeutic benefit
<br>
<br>For the purposes of paragraph (4)(A)(iii)(I) and (4)(B)(iii)(I) of subsection (a) and paragraphs (1)(B) and (2)(B)(iii)(I)(aa) of subsection (b), a drug or biological product shall be considered to represent a meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing therapies if the Secretary determines that—
<br>
<br>(1) if approved, the drug or biological product could represent an improvement in the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a disease, compared with marketed products adequately labeled for that use in the relevant pediatric population; or
<br>
<br>(2) the drug or biological product is in a class of products or for an indication for which there is a need for additional options.
<br>(d) Submission of assessments and reports on the investigation
<br>
<br>If a person fails to submit a required assessment described in subsection (a)(2) or the investigation described in subsection (a)(3), fails to meet the applicable requirements in subsection (a)(4), or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation described in subsection (a) or (b), in accordance with applicable provisions of subsections (a) and (b), the following shall apply:
<br>
<br>(1) Beginning 270 days after July 9, 2012, the Secretary shall issue a non-compliance letter to such person informing them of such failure to submit or meet the requirements of the applicable subsection. Such letter shall require the person to respond in writing within 45 calendar days of issuance of such letter. Such response may include the person's request for a deferral extension if applicable. Such letter and the person's written response to such letter shall be made publicly available on the Internet Web site of the Food and Drug Administration 60 calendar days after issuance, with redactions for any trade secrets and confidential commercial information. If the Secretary determines that the letter was issued in error, the requirements of this paragraph shall not apply. The Secretary shall inform the Pediatric Advisory Committee of letters issued under this paragraph and responses to such letters.
<br>
<br>(2) The drug or biological product that is the subject of an assessment described in subsection (a)(2) or the investigation described in subsection (a)(3), applicable requirements in subsection (a)(4), or request for approval of a pediatric formulation, may be considered misbranded solely because of that failure and subject to relevant enforcement action (except that the drug or biological product shall not be subject to action under section 333 of this title), but such failure shall not be the basis for a proceeding—
<br>
<br>(A) to withdraw approval for a drug under section 355(e) of this title; or
<br>
<br>(B) to revoke the license for a biological product under section 262 of title 42.
<br>(e) Pediatric study plans
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>An applicant subject to subsection (a) shall submit to the Secretary an initial pediatric study plan prior to the submission of the assessments described under subsection (a)(2) or the investigation described in subsection (a)(3).
<br>(2) Timing; content; meetings
<br>(A) Timing
<br>
<br>An applicant shall submit the initial pediatric study plan under paragraph (1)—
<br>
<br>(i) before the date on which the applicant submits the assessments under subsection (a)(2) or the investigation described in subsection (a)(3); and
