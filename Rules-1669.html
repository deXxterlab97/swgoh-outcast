<br>National Police Athletic/Activities League Youth Enrichment
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 106–367, Oct. 27, 2000, 114 Stat. 1412, as amended by Pub. L. 109–248, title VI, §§612–617, July 27, 2006, 120 Stat. 632, 633, provided that:
<br>"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
<br>
<br>"This Act may be cited as the 'National Police Athletic/Activities League Youth Enrichment Act of 2000'.
<br>"SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
<br>
<br>"Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>"(1) The goals of the Police Athletic/Activities League are to—
<br>
<br>"(A) increase the academic success of youth participants in PAL programs;
<br>
<br>"(B) promote a safe, healthy environment for youth under the supervision of law enforcement personnel where mutual trust and respect can be built;
<br>
<br>"(C) develop life enhancing character and leadership skills in young people;
<br>
<br>"(D) increase school attendance by providing alternatives to suspensions and expulsions;
<br>
<br>"(E) reduce the juvenile crime rate in participating designated communities and the number of police calls involving juveniles during nonschool hours;
<br>
<br>"(F) provide youths with alternatives to drugs, alcohol, tobacco, and gang activity;
<br>
<br>"(G) create positive communications and interaction between youth and law enforcement personnel; and
<br>
<br>"(H) prepare youth for the workplace.
<br>
<br>"(2) The Police Athletic/Activities League, during its 90-year history as a national organization, has proven to be a positive force in the communities it serves.
<br>
<br>"(3) The Police Athletic/Activities League is a network of 1,700 facilities serving over 3,000 communities. There are 350 PAL chapters throughout the United States, the Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, serving 2,000,000 youth, ages 5 to 18, nationwide.
<br>
<br>"(4) Based on PAL chapter demographics, approximately 85 percent of the youths who benefit from PAL programs live in inner cities and urban areas.
<br>
<br>"(5) PAL chapters are locally operated, volunteer-driven organizations. Although most PAL chapters are sponsored by a law enforcement agency, PAL chapters rarely receive direct funding from law enforcement agencies and are dependent in large part on support from the private sector, such as individuals, business leaders, corporations, and foundations. PAL chapters have been exceptionally successful in balancing public funds with private sector donations and maximizing community involvement.
<br>
<br>"(6) Today's youth face far greater risks than did their parents and grandparents. Law enforcement statistics demonstrate that youth between the ages of 12 and 18 are at risk of committing violent acts and being victims of violent acts between the hours of 3 p.m. and 8 p.m.
<br>
<br>"(7) Greater numbers of students are dropping out of school and failing in school, even though the consequences of academic failure are more dire in 2005 than ever before.
<br>
<br>"(8) Many distressed areas in the United States are still underserved by PAL chapters.
<br>"SEC. 3. PURPOSE.
<br>
<br>"The purpose of this Act is to provide adequate resources in the form of—
<br>
<br>"(1) assistance for the 342 established PAL chapters to increase of services to the communities they are serving;
<br>
<br>"(2) seed money for the establishment of 250 (50 per year over a 5-year period) additional local PAL chapters in public housing projects and other distressed areas, including distressed areas with a majority population of Native Americans, by not later than fiscal year 2010; and
<br>
<br>"(3) support of an annual gathering of PAL chapters and designated youth leaders from such chapters to participate in a 3-day conference that addresses national and local issues impacting the youth of America and includes educational sessions to advance character and leadership skills.
<br>"SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.

<br>
<br>[Pub. L. 109–248, title VI, §612(3)(B), July 27, 2006, 120 Stat. 632, which directed amendment of section 2(3) of Pub.

<br>Kids 2000 Crime Prevention and Computer Education Initiative
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 106–313, title I, §112, Oct. 17, 2000, 114 Stat. 1260, provided that:

<br>"(1) There is an increasing epidemic of juvenile crime throughout the United States.
<br>
<br>"(2) It is well documented that the majority of juvenile crimes take place during after-school hours.
<br>

<br>§11322. Accountability and oversight
<br>(a) Sense of Congress
<br>
<br>It is the sense of Congress that, in order to ensure that at-risk youth, and youth who come into contact with the juvenile justice system or the criminal justice system, are treated fairly and that the outcome of that contact is beneficial to the Nation—
<br>
<br>(1) the Department of Justice, through its Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, must restore meaningful enforcement of the core requirements in subchapter II; and
<br>
<br>(2) States, which are entrusted with a fiscal stewardship role if they accept funds under subchapter II 1 must exercise vigilant oversight to ensure full compliance with the core requirements for juveniles provided for in subchapter II.
<br>(b) Accountability
<br>(1) Agency program review

<br>(i) In general
<br>

<br>
<br>(II) changes are necessary in the authorizing statutes of the agency in order that the functions of the agency can be performed in a more efficient and effective manner; and
<br>
<br>(III) the agency has implemented recommendations issued by the Comptroller General or Office of Inspector General relating to the grant making and grant monitoring responsibilities of the agency.
<br>(iii) Considerations for audits
<br>
<br>In conducting the audit and evaluation under clause (i)(II), and in order to document the efficiency and public benefit of subchapters II and V, the Director shall take into consideration—
<br>
<br>(I) whether grantees timely file Financial Status Reports;

<br>(II) whether grantees have sufficient internal controls to ensure adequate oversight of grant funds received;
<br>
<br>(III) whether grantees' assertions of compliance with the core requirements were accompanied with adequate supporting documentation;
<br>
<br>(IV) whether expenditures were authorized;
<br>
<br>(V) whether subrecipients of grant funds were complying with program requirements; and
<br>
<br>(VI) whether grant funds were spent in accordance with the program goals and guidelines.
<br>(iv) Report
<br>
<br>The Director shall—
<br>
<br>(I) submit to the Congress a report outlining the results of the analysis, evaluation, and audit conducted under clause (i), including supporting materials, to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate; and
<br>
<br>(II) shall 2 make such report available to the public online, not later than 1 year after December 21, 2018.
<br>(B) Analysis of internal controls
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>Not later than 30 days after December 21, 2018, the Administrator shall initiate a comprehensive analysis and evaluation of the internal controls of the agency to determine whether, and to what extent, States and Indian Tribes that receive grants under subchapters II and V are following the requirements of the grant programs authorized under subchapters II and V.
