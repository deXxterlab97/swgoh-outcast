<br>(b) Conditions and form of bond
<br>
<br>Whenever a bond is required or authorized by a law, regulation, or instruction which the Secretary of the Treasury or the Customs Service is authorized to enforce, the Secretary of the Treasury may—
<br>
<br>(1) Except as otherwise specifically provided by law, prescribe the conditions and form of such bond and the manner in which the bond may be filed with or, pursuant to an authorized electronic data interchange system, transmitted to the Customs Service, and fix the amount of penalty thereof, whether for the payment of liquidated damages or of a penal sum: Provided, That when a consolidated bond authorized by paragraph 4 of this subsection is taken, the Secretary of the Treasury may fix the penalty of such bond without regard to any other provision of law, regulation, or instruction.
<br>
<br>(2) Provide for the approval of the sureties on such bond, without regard to any general provision of law.
<br>
<br>(3) Authorize the execution of a term bond the conditions of which shall extend to and cover similar cases of importations over such period of time, not to exceed one year, or such longer period as he may fix when in his opinion special circumstances existing in a particular instance require such longer period.
<br>
<br>(4) Authorize, to the extent that he may deem necessary, the taking of a consolidated bond (single entry or term), in lieu of separate bonds to assure compliance with two or more provisions of law, regulations, or instructions which the Secretary of the Treasury or the Customs Service is authorized to enforce.

In order to assure uniform, reasonable, and equitable decisions, the Secretary of the Treasury shall publish guidelines establishing standards for setting the terms and conditions for cancellation of bonds or charges thereunder.
<br>(d) Validity of bond
<br>
<br>No condition in any bond taken to assure compliance with any law, regulation, or instruction which the Secretary of the Treasury or the Customs Service is authorized to enforce shall be held invalid on the ground that such condition is not specified in the law, regulation, or instruction authorizing or requiring the taking of such bond. Any bond transmitted to the Customs Service pursuant to an authorized electronic data interchange system shall have the same force and effect and be binding upon the parties thereto as if such bond were manually executed, signed, and filed.
<br>(e) Deposit of money or obligation of United States in lieu of bond
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to permit the deposit of money or obligations of the United States, in such amount and upon such conditions as he may by regulation prescribe, in lieu of sureties on any bond required or authorized by a law, regulation, or instruction which the Secretary of the Treasury or the Customs Service is authorized to enforce.

<br>
<br>"(a) Findings.—Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>"(1) The increased security and safety concerns that developed in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11, 2001, need to be addressed.
<br>
<br>"(2) One concern that has come to light is the vulnerability of the international bridges and tunnels along the United States borders.
<br>
<br>"(3) It is necessary to ensure that potentially dangerous vehicles are inspected prior to crossing these bridges and tunnels; however, currently these vehicles are not inspected until after they have crossed into the United States.
<br>
<br>"(4) Establishing Integrated Border Inspection Areas (IBIAs) would address these concerns by inspecting vehicles before they gained access to the infrastructure of international bridges and tunnels joining the United States and Canada.
<br>
<br>"(b) Creation of Integrated Border Inspection Areas.—
<br>
<br>"(1) In general.—The Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, in consultation with the Canadian Customs and Revenue Agency (CCRA), shall seek to establish Integrated Border Inspection Areas (IBIAs), such as areas on either side of the United States-Canada border, in which United States Customs officers can inspect vehicles entering the United States from Canada before they enter the United States, or Canadian Customs officers can inspect vehicles entering Canada from the United States before they enter Canada. Such inspections may include, where appropriate, employment of reverse inspection techniques.
<br>
<br>"(2) Additional requirement.—The Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, in consultation with the Administrator of the General Services Administration when appropriate, shall seek to carry out paragraph (1) in a manner that minimizes adverse impacts on the surrounding community.
<br>
<br>"(3) Elements of the program.—Using the authority granted by this section and under section 629 of the Tariff Act of 1930 [19 U.S.C. 1629], the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, in consultation with the Canadian Customs and Revenue Agency, shall seek to—
<br>
<br>"(A) locate Integrated Border Inspection Areas in areas with bridges or tunnels with high traffic volume, significant commercial activity, and that have experienced backups and delays since September 11, 2001;
<br>
<br>"(B) ensure that United States Customs officers stationed in any such IBIA on the Canadian side of the border are vested with the maximum authority to carry out their duties and enforce United States law;
<br>
<br>"(C) ensure that United States Customs officers stationed in any such IBIA on the Canadian side of the border shall possess the same immunity that they would possess if they were stationed in the United States; and
<br>
<br>"(D) encourage appropriate officials of the United States to enter into an agreement with Canada permitting Canadian Customs officers stationed in any such IBIA on the United States side of the border to enjoy such immunities as permitted in Canada."
<br>Creation of Integrated Border Inspection Areas
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 108–7, div. J, title I, §127(a), Feb. 20, 2003, 117 Stat. 440, which related to the creation of integrated border inspection areas on either side of the United States–Canada border, was repealed by Pub. L. 108–429, title I, §1561(c), Dec. 3, 2004, 118 Stat. 2582.

<br>(b) Limitations
<br>
<br>The Secretary may not pay a claim under subsection (a) that—
<br>
<br>(1) concerns commercial property;
<br>
<br>(2) is presented to the Secretary more than 1 year after it occurs; or
<br>
<br>(3) is presented by an officer or employee of the United States Government and arose within the scope of employment.
<br>(c) Final settlement

At the hearing, the customs broker may be represented by counsel, and all proceedings, including the proof of the charges and the response thereto shall be presented with testimony taken under oath and the right of cross-examination accorded to both parties. A transcript of the hearing shall be made and a copy will be provided to U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the customs broker; which shall thereafter be provided reasonable opportunity to file a post-hearing brief. Following the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall transmit promptly the record of the hearing along with the findings of fact and recommendations to the Secretary for decision.

<br>(3) Settlement and compromise
<br>
<br>The Secretary may settle and compromise any disciplinary proceeding which has been instituted under this subsection according to the terms and conditions agreed to by the parties, including but not limited to the reduction of any proposed suspension or revocation to a monetary penalty.
<br>(4) Limitation of actions
<br>

The Secretary may modify the findings of facts on the basis of the additional evidence presented.
