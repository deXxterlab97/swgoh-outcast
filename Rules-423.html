The appropriate Federal banking agency shall give due consideration to the views and recommendations of such State agency in determining whether to disapprove any proposed acquisition. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, if the appropriate Federal banking agency determines that it must act immediately upon any notice of a proposed acquisition in order to prevent the probable default of the depository institution involved in the proposed acquisition, such Federal banking agency may dispense with the requirements of this paragraph or, if a copy of the notice is forwarded to the State depository institution supervisory agency, such Federal banking agency may request that the views and recommendations of such State depository institution supervisory agency be submitted immediately in any form or by any means acceptable to such Federal banking agency.

<br>
<br>(3) Within three days after its decision to disapprove any proposed acquisition, the appropriate Federal banking agency shall notify the acquiring party in writing of the disapproval. Such notice shall provide a statement of the basis for the disapproval.
<br>
<br>(4) Within ten days of receipt of such notice of disapproval, the acquiring party may request an agency hearing on the proposed acquisition.
