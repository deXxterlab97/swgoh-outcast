<br>§4145. Delivery of assistance through intermediaries
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall approve and disburse assistance under section 4143 of this title through eligible intermediaries selected by the Secretary under subsection (b). If the Secretary does not receive an acceptable proposal from an intermediary offering to administer assistance under this section in a given State, the Secretary shall administer the program in such State directly.
<br>(b) Selection of eligible intermediaries
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall develop criteria to select eligible intermediaries, through a competitive process, to administer assistance under this subchapter. The process shall include provision for a reasonable administrative fee.
<br>(2) Priority
<br>
<br>With respect to all forms of grants available under section 4143 of this title, such criteria shall give priority to applications from eligible intermediaries with demonstrated expertise or experience with the program established under this title 1 or under the Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987.
<br>(3) Criteria
<br>
<br>The criteria developed under this subsection shall—
<br>
<br>(A) not assign any preference or priority to applications from eligible intermediaries based on their previous participation in administering or receiving Federal grants or loans (but may exclude applicants who have failed to perform under prior contracts of a similar nature);
<br>
<br>(B) require an applicant to prepare a proposal that demonstrates adequate staffing, qualifications, prior experience, and a plan for participation; and
<br>
<br>(C) permit an applicant to serve as the administrator of assistance made available under section 4143(d) or (e) of this title, based on the applicant's suitability and interest.
<br>(4) Geographic coverage
<br>
<br>The Secretary may select more than 1 State or regional intermediary for a single State or region. The number of intermediaries chosen for each State or region may be based on the number of eligible low-income housing projects in the State or region, provided there is no duplication of geographic coverage by intermediaries in the administration of the direct assistance grant program.
<br>(5) National nonprofit intermediaries
<br>
<br>National nonprofit intermediaries shall be selected to administer the assistance made available under section 4143 of this title only with respect to States or regions for which no other eligible intermediary, acceptable to the Secretary, has submitted a proposal to participate.
<br>(6) Preference
<br>
<br>With respect to assistance made available under section 4144 of this title, preference shall be given to eligible regional, State, and local intermediaries, over national nonprofit organizations.

<br>(b) "Original source" defined
<br>

<br>§4301. Findings and purpose
<br>(a) Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress hereby finds that economic stability would be enhanced, competition between depository institutions would be improved, and the ability of the consumer to make informed decisions regarding deposit accounts, and to verify accounts, would be strengthened if there was uniformity in the disclosure of terms and conditions on which interest is paid and fees are assessed in connection with such accounts.
<br>(b) Purpose
<br>
<br>It is the purpose of this chapter to require the clear and uniform disclosure of—
<br>
<br>(1) the rates of interest which are payable on deposit accounts by depository institutions; and
<br>
<br>(2) the fees that are assessable against deposit accounts,
<br>
<br>so that consumers can make a meaningful comparison between the competing claims of depository institutions with regard to deposit accounts.

<br>Separability
<br>
<br>If any provision of Pub. L. 102–242 or any application of any provision thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of Pub. L. 102–242 and the application of any remaining provision of such Act to any other person or circumstance not to be affected by such holding, see section 481 of Pub. L. 102–242, set out as a note under section 1811 of this title.
<br>§4302. Disclosure of interest rates and terms of accounts
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c), each advertisement, announcement, or solicitation initiated by any depository institution or deposit broker relating to any demand or interest-bearing account offered by an insured depository institution which includes any reference to a specific rate of interest payable on amounts deposited in such account, or to a specific yield or rate of earnings on amounts so deposited, shall state the following information, to the extent applicable, in a clear and conspicuous manner:
<br>
<br>(1) The annual percentage yield.
<br>
<br>(2) The period during which such annual percentage yield is in effect.
<br>
<br>(3) All minimum account balance and time requirements which must be met in order to earn the advertised yield (and, in the case of accounts for which more than 1 yield is stated, each annual percentage yield and the account minimum balance requirement associated with each such yield shall be in close proximity and have equal prominence).
<br>
<br>(4) The minimum amount of the initial deposit which is required to open the account in order to obtain the yield advertised, if such minimum amount is greater than the minimum balance necessary to earn the advertised yield.
<br>
<br>(5) A statement that regular fees or other conditions could reduce the yield.
<br>
<br>(6) A statement that an interest penalty is required for early withdrawal.
<br>(b) Broadcast and electronic media and outdoor advertising exception
<br>
<br>The Bureau may, by regulation, exempt advertisements, announcements, or solicitations made by any broadcast or electronic medium or outdoor advertising display not on the premises of the depository institution from any disclosure requirements described in paragraph (4) or (5) of subsection (a) if the Bureau finds that any such disclosure would be unnecessarily burdensome.
<br>(c) Disclosure required for on-premises displays
<br>
<br>The disclosure requirements contained in this section shall not apply to any sign (including a rate board) disclosing a rate or rates of interest which is displayed on the premises of the depository institution if such sign contains—
<br>
<br>(1) the accompanying annual percentage yield; and
<br>
<br>(2) a statement that the consumer should request further information from an employee of the depository institution concerning the fees and terms applicable to the advertised account.
<br>(d) Misleading descriptions of free or no-cost accounts prohibited
<br>
<br>No advertisement, announcement, or solicitation made by any depository institution or deposit broker may refer to or describe an account as a free or no-cost account (or words of similar meaning) if—
<br>
<br>(1) in order to avoid fees or service charges for any period—
<br>
<br>(A) a minimum balance must be maintained in the account during such period; or
<br>
<br>(B) the number of transactions during such period may not exceed a maximum number; or
<br>
<br>(2) any regular service or transaction fee is imposed.
<br>(e) Misleading or inaccurate advertisements, etc., prohibited
<br>
<br>No depository institution or deposit broker shall make any advertisement, announcement, or solicitation relating to a deposit account that is inaccurate or misleading or that misrepresents its deposit contracts.
