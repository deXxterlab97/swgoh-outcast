<br>

<br>
<br>"(c) Other Debt Reduction Authorities.—The authority provided in this section is in addition to any other debt relief authority and does not in any way limit such authority.
<br>
<br>"(d) Eligible Countries.—A country that is performing satisfactorily under an economic reform program shall be eligible for cancellation of debt under this section if—
<br>
<br>"(1) the country, as of December 31, 2000, is eligible to borrow from the International Development Association;
<br>
<br>"(2) the country, as of December 31, 2000, is not eligible to borrow from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development; and
<br>
<br>"(3)(A) the country has outstanding public and publicly guaranteed debt, the net present value of which on December 31, 1996, was at least 150 percent of the average annual value of the exports of the country for the period 1994 through 1996; or
<br>
<br>"(B)(i) the country has outstanding public and publicly guaranteed debt, the net present value of which, as of the date the President determines that the country is eligible for debt relief under this section, is at least 150 percent of the annual value of the exports of the country; or
<br>
<br>"(ii) the country has outstanding public and publicly guaranteed debt, the net present value of which, as of the date the President determines that the country is eligible for debt relief under this section, is at least 250 percent of the annual fiscal revenues of the country, and has minimum ratios of exports to Gross Domestic Product of 30 percent, and of fiscal revenues to Gross Domestic Product of 15 percent.
<br>
<br>"(e) Priority.—In carrying out subsection (a), the President should seek to leverage scarce foreign assistance and give priority to heavily indebted poor countries with demonstrated need and the capacity to use such relief effectively.
<br>
<br>"(f) Exceptions.—A country shall not be eligible for cancellation of debt under this section if the government of the country—
<br>
<br>"(1) has an excessive level of military expenditures;
<br>
<br>"(2) has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism, as determined by the Secretary of State under [former] section 6(j)(1) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C.

<br>
<br>"(1) to enable, facilitate, or encourage the implementation of policy changes and institutional reforms under economic reform programs, in a manner that ensures that such policy changes and institutional reforms are designed and adopted through transparent and participatory processes;
<br>
<br>"(2) to adopt an integrated development strategy of the type described in section 1624(a) of the International Financial Institutions Act [22 U.S.C. 262p–7], to support poverty reduction through economic growth, that includes monitorable poverty reduction goals;
<br>
<br>"(3) to take steps so that the financial benefits of debt relief are applied to programs to combat poverty (in particular through concrete measures to improve economic infrastructure, basic services in education, nutrition, and health, particularly treatment and prevention of the leading causes of mortality) and to redress environmental degradation;
<br>
<br>"(4) to take steps to strengthen and expand the private sector, encourage increased trade and investment, support the development of free markets, and promote broad-scale economic growth;
<br>
<br>"(5) to implement transparent policy making and budget procedures, good governance, and effective anticorruption measures;
<br>
<br>"(6) to broaden public participation and popular understanding of the principles and goals of poverty reduction, particularly through economic growth, and good governance; and
<br>
<br>"(7) to promote the participation of citizens and nongovernmental organizations in the economic policy choices of the government.
<br>
<br>"(h) Certain Prohibitions Inapplicable.—Except as the President may otherwise determine for reasons of national security, a cancellation of debt under this section shall not be considered to be assistance for purposes of any provision of law limiting assistance to a country. The authority to provide for cancellation of debt under this section may be exercised notwithstanding section 620(r) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [22 U.S.C. 2370(r)], or any similar provision of law.
<br>
<br>"(i) Authorization of Appropriations.—For the cost (as defined in section 502(5) of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 [2 U.S.C. 661a(5)]) of the cancellation of any debt under this section, there are authorized to be appropriated to the President such sums as may be necessary for each of the fiscal years 2000–2025, which shall remain available until expended.
<br>
<br>"(j) Annual Reports to the Congress.—Not later than December 31 of each year, the President shall prepare and transmit to the Committees on Banking and Financial Services [now Committee on Financial Services], Appropriations, and International Relations [now Committee on Foreign Affairs] of the House of Representatives, and the Committees on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, Foreign Relations, and Appropriations of the Senate a report, which shall be made available to the public, concerning the cancellation of debt under subsection (a), and a detailed description of debt relief provided by the United States as a member of the Paris Club of Official Creditors for the prior fiscal year."

<br>§2406. Development programs for dependable fuel supplies
<br>
<br>It is of paramount importance that long-range economic plans take cognizance of the need for a dependable supply of fuels, which is necessary to orderly and stable development and growth, and that dependence not be placed upon sources which are inherently hostile to free countries and the ultimate well-being of economically underdeveloped countries and which might exploit such dependence for ultimate political domination. The agencies of government in the United States are directed to work with other countries in developing plans for basing development programs on the use of the large and stable supply of relatively low cost fuels available in the free world.
