<br>(2) Timing
<br>
<br>The Secretary may not submit to Congress an assessment of a feasibility study under this section until such time as the Secretary—
<br>
<br>(A) determines that the feasibility study complies with all of the requirements that would apply to a feasibility study undertaken by the Secretary; and
<br>
<br>(B) completes all of the Federal analyses, reviews, and compliance processes under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), that would be required with respect to the proposed project if the Secretary had undertaken the feasibility study.

<br>(A) Request
<br>(i) Submission
<br>
<br>The non-Federal interest may submit to the Secretary a request that the Secretary initiate the analyses, reviews, and compliance processes described in paragraph (2)(B) with respect to the proposed project prior to the non-Federal interest's submission of a feasibility study under subsection (a)(1).
<br>(ii) Effect
<br>
<br>Receipt by the Secretary of a request submitted under clause (i) shall be considered the receipt of a proposal or application that will lead to a major Federal action that is subject to the requirements of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)) that would be required if the Secretary were to undertake the feasibility study.
<br>(B) Deadline

<br>§2236. Port or harbor dues
<br>(a) Consent of Congress
<br>
<br>Subject to the following conditions, a non-Federal interest may levy port or harbor dues (in the form of tonnage duties or fees) on a vessel engaged in trade entering or departing from a harbor and on cargo loaded on or unloaded from that vessel under clauses 2 and 3 of section 10, and under clause 3 of section 8, of Article 1 of the Constitution:
<br>(1) Purposes
<br>
<br>Port or harbor dues may be levied only in conjunction with a harbor navigation project whose construction is complete (including a usable increment of the project) and for the following purposes and in amounts not to exceed those necessary to carry out those purposes:
<br>
<br>(A)(i) to finance the non-Federal share of construction and operation and maintenance costs of a navigation project for a harbor under the requirements of section 2211 of this title; or
<br>
<br>(ii) to finance the cost of construction and operation and maintenance of a navigation project for a harbor under section 2232 or 2233 of this title; and
<br>
<br>(B) provide emergency response services in the harbor, including contingency planning, necessary personnel training, and the procurement of equipment and facilities.
<br>(2) Limitation on port or harbor dues for emergency service
<br>
<br>Port or harbor dues may not be levied for the purposes described in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection after the dues cease to be levied for the purposes described in paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection.
<br>(3) General limitations
<br>
<br>(A) Port or harbor dues may not be levied under this section in conjunction with a deepening feature of a navigation improvement project on any vessel if that vessel, based on its design draft, could have utilized the project at mean low water before construction. In the case of project features which solely—
<br>
<br>(i) widen channels or harbors,
<br>
<br>(ii) create or enlarge bend easings, turning basins or anchorage areas, or provide protected areas, or
<br>
<br>(iii) remove obstructions to navigation,
<br>
<br>only vessels at least comparable in size to those used to justify these features may be charged under this section.
<br>
<br>(B) In developing port or harbor dues that may be charged under this section on vessels for project features constructed under this subchapter, the non-Federal interest may consider such criteria as: elapsed time of passage, safety of passage, vessel economy of scale, under keel clearance, vessel draft, vessel squat, vessel speed, sinkage, and trim.
<br>
<br>(C) Port or harbor dues authorized by this section shall not be imposed on—
<br>
<br>(i) vessels owned and operated by the United States Government, a foreign country, a State, or a political subdivision of a country or State, unless engaged in commercial services;
<br>
<br>(ii) towing vessels, vessels engaged in dredging activities, or vessels engaged in intraport movements; or
<br>
<br>(iii) vessels with design drafts of 20 feet or less when utilizing general cargo and deep-draft navigation projects.
<br>(4) Formulation of port or harbor dues
<br>
<br>Port or harbor dues may be levied only on a vessel entering or departing from a harbor and its cargo on a fair and equitable basis. In formulating port and harbor dues, the non-Federal interest shall consider—
<br>
<br>(A) the direct and indirect cost of construction, operations, and maintenance, and providing the facilities and services under paragraph (1) of this subsection;
<br>
<br>(B) the value of those facilities and services to the vessel and cargo;
<br>
<br>(C) the public policy or interest served; and
<br>
<br>(D) any other pertinent factors.
<br>(5) Notice and hearing
<br>
<br>(A) Before the initial levy of or subsequent modification to port or harbor dues under this section, a non-Federal interest shall transmit to the Secretary—
<br>
<br>(i) the text of the proposed law, regulation, or ordinance that would establish the port or harbor dues, including provisions for their administration, collection, and enforcement;
<br>
<br>(ii) the name, address, and telephone number of an official to whom comments on and requests for further information on the proposal are to be directed;
<br>
<br>(iii) the date by which comments on the proposal are due and a date for a public hearing on the proposal at which any interested party may present a statement; however, the non-Federal interest may not set a hearing date earlier than 45 days after the date of publication of the notice in the Federal Register required by subparagraph (B) of this paragraph or set a deadline for receipt of comments earlier than 60 days after the date of publication; and
<br>
<br>(iv) a written statement signed by an appropriate official that the non-Federal interest agrees to be governed by the provisions of this section.
<br>
<br>(B) On receiving from a non-Federal interest the information required by subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Secretary shall transmit the material required by clauses (i) through (iii) of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph to the Federal Register for publication.
<br>
<br>(C) Port or harbor dues may be imposed by a non-Federal interest only after meeting the conditions of this paragraph.
<br>(6) Requirements on non-Federal interest
<br>
<br>A non-Federal interest shall—
<br>
<br>(A) file a schedule of any port or harbor dues levied under this subsection with the Secretary and the Federal Maritime Commission, which the Commission shall make available for public inspection;
<br>
<br>(B) provide to the Comptroller General of the United States on request of the Comptroller General any records or other evidence that the Comptroller General considers to be necessary and appropriate to enable the Comptroller General to carry out the audit required under subsection (b) 1 of this section;

<br>(B) Before departure of vessel
<br>
<br>The shipper, consignor, or terminal operator having custody of any cargo to be loaded on board a vessel while the vessel is in a harbor in which the vessel may be subject to the levy of port or harbor dues under this section shall, within forty-eight hours before departure of that vessel, deliver to the appropriate authorized representative appointed under subsection (a)(6)(C) of this section an export declaration specifying the cargo to be loaded on board that vessel.
<br>(d) Enforcement
<br>
<br>At the request of an authorized representative referred to in subsection (a)(6)(C) of this section, the Secretary of the Treasury may:
<br>
