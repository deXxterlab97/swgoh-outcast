<br>
<br>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:
<br>
<br>Section 1. Purpose. The ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes waters of the United States are foundational to the economy, security, global competitiveness, and well-being of the United States. Ocean industries employ millions of Americans and support a strong national economy. Domestic energy production from Federal waters strengthens the Nation's security and reduces reliance on imported energy. Our Armed Forces protect our national interests in the ocean and along the Nation's coasts. Goods and materials that support our economy and quality of life flow through maritime commerce. Our fisheries resources help feed the Nation and present tremendous export opportunities. Clean, healthy waters support fishing, boating, and other recreational opportunities for all Americans.
<br>
<br>This order maintains and enhances these and other benefits to the Nation through improved public access to marine data and information, efficient interagency coordination on ocean-related matters, and engagement with marine industries, the science and technology community, and other ocean stakeholders. To advance these national interests, this order recognizes and supports Federal participation in regional ocean partnerships, to the extent appropriate and consistent with national security interests and statutory authorities.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. Policy. It shall be the policy of the United States to:
<br>

<br>
<br>(b) continue to promote the lawful use of the ocean by agencies, including United States Armed Forces;
<br>
<br>(c) exercise rights and jurisdiction and perform duties in accordance with applicable domestic law and—if consistent with applicable domestic law—international law, including customary international law;
<br>
<br>(d) facilitate the economic growth of coastal communities and promote ocean industries, which employ millions of Americans, advance ocean science and technology, feed the American people, transport American goods, expand recreational opportunities, and enhance America's energy security;
<br>
<br>(e) ensure that Federal regulations and management decisions do not prevent productive and sustainable use of ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes waters;
<br>
<br>(f) modernize the acquisition, distribution, and use of the best available ocean-related science and knowledge, in partnership with marine industries; the ocean science and technology community; State, tribal, and local governments; and other ocean stakeholders, to inform decisions and enhance entrepreneurial opportunity; and
<br>
<br>(g) facilitate, as appropriate, coordination, consultation, and collaboration regarding ocean-related matters, consistent with applicable law, among Federal, State, tribal, and local governments, marine industries, the ocean science and technology community, other ocean stakeholders, and foreign governments and international organizations.
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. Definitions. For the purposes of this order, the following definitions apply:
<br>
<br>(a) "Ocean-related matters" means management, science, and technology matters involving the ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes waters of the United States (including its territories and possessions), and related seabed, subsoil, waters superadjacent to the seabed, and natural resources.
<br>
<br>(b) "Regional ocean partnership" means a regional organization of coastal or Great Lakes States, territories, or possessions voluntarily convened by governors to address cross-jurisdictional ocean matters, or the functional equivalent of such a regional ocean organization designated by the governor or governors of a State or States.
