<br>(3) Requirement of status as medicaid provider
<br>
<br>(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), the Secretary may make a grant under paragraph (1) only if, in the case of any service under such paragraph that is covered in the State plan approved under title XIX of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.] for the State involved—
<br>
<br>(i) the entity involved will provide the service directly, and the entity has entered into a participation agreement under the State plan and is qualified to receive payments under such plan; or
<br>
<br>(ii) the entity will enter into an agreement with an organization under which the organization will provide the service, and the organization has entered into such a participation agreement and is qualified to receive such payments.
<br>
<br>(B)(i) In the case of an organization making an agreement under subparagraph (A)(ii) regarding the provision of services under paragraph (1), the requirement established in such subparagraph regarding a participation agreement shall be waived by the Secretary if the organization does not, in providing health or mental health services, impose a charge or accept reimbursement available from any third-party payor, including reimbursement under any insurance policy or under any Federal or State health benefits program.
<br>
<br>(ii) A determination by the Secretary of whether an organization referred to in clause (i) meets the criteria for a waiver under such clause shall be made without regard to whether the organization accepts voluntary donations regarding the provision of services to the public.
<br>(b) Home visiting services for eligible families
<br>
<br>With respect to an eligible family, each of the following services shall, directly or through arrangement with other public or nonprofit private entities, be available (as applicable to the family member involved) in each project operated with a grant under subsection (a):
<br>
<br>(1) Prenatal and postnatal health care.
<br>
<br>(2) Primary health care for the children, including developmental assessments.

<br>
<br>(2) different combinations of professional and lay home visitors utilized within programs that are reflective of the identified service needs and characteristics of target populations;
<br>
<br>(3) the extent to which the population to be targeted has limited access to health care, and related social, family support, and developmental services; and

<br>(4) whether such grants are equitably distributed among urban and rural settings and whether entities serving Native American communities are represented among the grantees.
<br>(d) Federal share
<br>
<br>With respect to the costs of carrying out a project under subsection (a), a grant under such subsection for the project may not exceed 90 percent of such costs.

<br>(e) Rule of construction regarding at-risk births
<br>
<br>For purposes of subsection (a)(1), a pregnant woman shall be considered to be at risk of delivering an infant with a health or developmental complication if during the pregnancy the woman—
<br>
<br>(1) lacks appropriate access to, or information concerning, early and routine prenatal care;
<br>
<br>(2) lacks the transportation necessary to gain access to the services described in subsection (b);
<br>
<br>(3) lacks appropriate child care assistance, which results in impeding the ability of such woman to utilize health and related social services;
<br>
<br>(4) is fearful of accessing substance abuse services or child and family support services; or
<br>
<br>(5) is a minor with a low income.
<br>(f) Delivery of services and case management

<br>(2) Case manager
<br>
<br>A case manager assigned under paragraph (1) shall have primary responsibility for coordinating and overseeing the development of a plan for each family that is to receive home visiting services under this section, and for coordinating the delivery of such services provided through appropriate personnel.

<br>In determining which personnel shall be utilized in the delivery of services, the case manager shall consider—

<br>
<br>A case manager, in consultation with a team established in accordance with paragraph (5) for the family involved, shall develop a plan for the family following the initial visit to the home of the family. Such plan shall reflect—

<br>(A) an assessment of the health and related social service needs of the family;
<br>
<br>(B) a structured plan for the delivery of home visiting services to meet the identified needs of the family;
<br>
<br>(C) the frequency with which such services are to be provided to the family;
<br>
<br>(D) ongoing revisions made as the needs of family members change; and
<br>
<br>(E) the continuing voluntary participation of the family in the plan.
<br>(5) Home visiting services team
<br>
<br>The team to be consulted under paragraph (4) on behalf of a family shall include, as appropriate, other nursing professionals, physician assistants, social workers, child welfare professionals, infant and early childhood specialists, nutritionists, and laypersons trained as home visitors. The case manager shall ensure that the plan is coordinated with those physician services that may be required by the mother or child.
<br>(g) Outreach
<br>
<br>Each grantee under subsection (a) shall provide outreach and casefinding services to inform eligible families of the availability of home visiting services from the project.

<br>(1) Statewide cancer registries
<br>
<br>The Secretary, acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control, may make grants to States, or may make grants or enter into contracts with academic or nonprofit organizations designated by the State to operate the State's cancer registry in lieu of making a grant directly to the State, to support the operation of population-based, statewide registries to collect, for each condition specified in paragraph (2)(A), data concerning—
<br>
<br>(A) demographic information about each case of cancer;
<br>
<br>(B) information on the industrial or occupational history of the individuals with the cancers, to the extent such information is available from the same record;
<br>
<br>(C) administrative information, including date of diagnosis and source of information;
<br>
<br>(D) pathological data characterizing the cancer, including the cancer site, stage of disease (pursuant to Staging Guide), incidence, and type of treatment; and
<br>
<br>(E) other elements determined appropriate by the Secretary.
<br>(2) Cancer; benign brain-related tumors
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>For purposes of paragraph (1), the conditions referred to in this paragraph are the following:
<br>
<br>(i) Each form of in-situ and invasive cancer (with the exception of basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin), including malignant brain-related tumors.
<br>
<br>(ii) Benign brain-related tumors.
<br>(B) Brain-related tumor
<br>
<br>For purposes of subparagraph (A):
<br>
<br>(i) The term "brain-related tumor" means a listed primary tumor (whether malignant or benign) occurring in any of the following sites:
<br>
<br>(I) The brain, meninges, spinal cord, cauda equina, a cranial nerve or nerves, or any other part of the central nervous system.
<br>
<br>(II) The pituitary gland, pineal gland, or craniopharyngeal duct.
<br>
<br>(ii) The term "listed", with respect to a primary tumor, means a primary tumor that is listed in the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (commonly referred to as the ICD–O).
<br>
<br>(iii) The term "International Classification of Diseases for Oncology" means a classification system that includes topography (site) information and histology (cell type information) developed by the World Health Organization, in collaboration with international centers, to promote international comparability in the collection, classification, processing, and presentation of cancer statistics. The ICD–O system is a supplement to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (commonly known as the ICD) and is the standard coding system used by cancer registries worldwide. Such term includes any modification made to such system for purposes of the United States. Such term further includes any published classification system that is internationally recognized as a successor to the classification system referred to in the first sentence of this clause.
<br>(C) Statewide cancer registry
<br>
<br>References in this section to cancer registries shall be considered to be references to registries described in this subsection.
<br>(b) Matching funds
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary may make a grant under subsection (a) only if the State, or the academic or nonprofit private organization designated by the State to operate the cancer registry of the State, involved agrees, with respect to the costs of the program, to make available (directly or through donations from public or private entities) non-Federal contributions toward such costs in an amount that is not less than 25 percent of such costs or $1 for every $3 of Federal funds provided in the grant.
<br>(2) Determination of amount of non-Federal contribution; maintenance of effort
<br>
<br>(A) Non-Federal contributions required in paragraph (1) may be in cash or in kind, fairly evaluated, including plant, equipment, or services. Amounts provided by the Federal Government, or services assisted or subsidized to any significant extent by the Federal Government, may not be included in determining the amount of such non-Federal contributions.
<br>
<br>(B) With respect to a State in which the purpose described in subsection (a) is to be carried out, the Secretary, in making a determination of the amount of non-Federal contributions provided under paragraph (1), may include only such contributions as are in excess of the amount of such contributions made by the State toward the collection of data on cancer for the fiscal year preceding the first year for which a grant under subsection (a) is made with respect to the State. The Secretary may decrease the amount of non-Federal contributions that otherwise would have been required by this subsection in those cases in which the State can demonstrate that decreasing such amount is appropriate because of financial hardship.
<br>(c) Eligibility for grants
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>No grant shall be made by the Secretary under subsection (a) unless an application has been submitted to, and approved by, the Secretary. Such application shall be in such form, submitted in such a manner, and be accompanied by such information, as the Secretary may specify.

<br>
<br>(i) a means to assure complete reporting of cancer cases (as described in subsection (a)) to the statewide cancer registry by hospitals or other facilities providing screening, diagnostic or therapeutic services to patients with respect to cancer;
<br>
<br>(ii) a means to assure the complete reporting of cancer cases (as defined in subsection (a)) to the statewide cancer registry by physicians, surgeons, and all other health care practitioners diagnosing or providing treatment for cancer patients, except for cases directly referred to or previously admitted to a hospital or other facility providing screening, diagnostic or therapeutic services to patients in that State and reported by those facilities;
<br>
<br>(iii) a means for the statewide cancer registry to access all records of physicians and surgeons, hospitals, outpatient clinics, nursing homes, and all other facilities, individuals, or agencies providing such services to patients which would identify cases of cancer or would establish characteristics of the cancer, treatment of the cancer, or medical status of any identified patient;
<br>
<br>(iv) for the reporting of cancer case data to the statewide cancer registry in such a format, with such data elements, and in accordance with such standards of quality timeliness and completeness, as may be established by the Secretary;
<br>
<br>(v) for the protection of the confidentiality of all cancer case data reported to the statewide cancer registry, including a prohibition on disclosure to any person of information reported to the statewide cancer registry that identifies, or could lead to the identification of, an individual cancer patient, except for disclosure to other State cancer registries and local and State health officers;

<br>
<br>(viii) for protection for individuals complying with the law, including provisions specifying that no person shall be held liable in any civil action with respect to a cancer case report provided to the statewide cancer registry, or with respect to access to cancer case information provided to the statewide cancer registry.
<br>(d) Relationship to certain programs
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>This section may not be construed to act as a replacement for or diminishment of the program carried out by the Director of the National Cancer Institute and designated by such Director as the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER).
<br>(2) Supplanting of activities
<br>
<br>In areas where both such programs exist, the Secretary shall ensure that SEER support is not supplanted and that any additional activities are consistent with the guidelines provided for in subsection (c)(2)(C) and (D) and are appropriately coordinated with the existing SEER program.
<br>(3) Transfer of responsibility
<br>
<br>The Secretary may not transfer administration responsibility for such SEER program from such Director.
<br>(4) Coordination
<br>
<br>To encourage the greatest possible efficiency and effectiveness of Federally supported efforts with respect to the activities described in this subsection, the Secretary shall take steps to assure the appropriate coordination of programs supported under this part with existing Federally supported cancer registry programs.
<br>(e) Requirement regarding certain study on breast cancer
<br>
<br>In the case of a grant under subsection (a) to any State specified in subsection (b) of section 280e–3 of this title, the Secretary may establish such conditions regarding the receipt of the grant as the Secretary determines are necessary to facilitate the collection of data for the study carried out under such section.

<br>"SEC. 2. FINDINGS
<br>
<br>"Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>"(1) Cancer kills more children than any other disease.
<br>
<br>"(2) Each year cancer kills more children between 1 and 20 years of age than asthma, diabetes, cystic fibrosis, and AIDS, combined.
<br>
<br>"(3) Every year, over 12,500 young people are diagnosed with cancer.
<br>
<br>"(4) Each year about 2,300 children and teenagers die from cancer.
<br>
<br>"(5) One in every 330 Americans develops cancer before age 20.
<br>
<br>"(6) Some forms of childhood cancer have proven to be so resistant that even in spite of the great research strides made, most of those children die. Up to 75 percent of the children with cancer can now be cured.
<br>
<br>"(7) The causes of most childhood cancers are not yet known.
<br>
<br>"(8) Childhood cancers are mostly those of the white blood cells (leukemias), brain, bone, the lymphatic system, and tumors of the muscles, kidneys, and nervous system. Each of these behaves differently, but all are characterized by an uncontrolled proliferation of abnormal cells.
<br>
<br>"(9) Eighty percent of the children who are diagnosed with cancer have disease which has already spread to distant sites in the body.
<br>
<br>"(10) Ninety percent of children with a form of pediatric cancer are treated at one of the more than 200 Children's Oncology Group member institutions throughout the United States.
<br>"SEC. 3. PURPOSES
