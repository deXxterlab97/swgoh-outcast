<br>Message of the President 2
<br>
<br>To the Congress of the United States:
<br>
<br>I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1970, prepared in accordance with chapter 9 of title 5 of the United States Code. The plan would transfer to the Secretary of Commerce various functions relating to the oceans and atmosphere, including commercial fishery functions, and would establish a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the Department of Commerce. My reasons for transmitting this plan are stated in a more extended accompanying message.
<br>
<br>After investigation, I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1970 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 901(a) of title 5 of the United States Code. In particular, the plan is responsive to section 901(a)(1), "to promote the better execution of the laws, the more effective management of the executive branch and of its agencies and functions, and the expeditious administration of the public business;" and section 901(a)(3), "to increase the efficiency of the operations of the Government to the fullest extent practicable."
<br>
<br>The reorganizations provided for in the plan make necessary the appointment and compensation of new officers as specified in section 2 of the plan. The rates of compensation fixed for these officers are comparable to those fixed for other officers in the executive branch who have similar responsibilities.
<br>
<br>The reorganization plan should result in the more efficient operation of the Government. It is not practical, however, to itemize or aggregate the exact expenditure reductions which will result from this action.

<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13577. Establishment of the SelectUSA Initiative
<br>
<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13577, June 15, 2011, 76 F.R. 35715, provided:
<br>
<br>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to support private-sector job creation and enhance economic growth by encouraging and supporting business investment in the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:
<br>
<br>Section 1. Policy. Business investment in the United States by both domestic and foreign firms, whether in the form of new equipment or facilities or the expansion of existing facilities, is a major engine of economic growth and job creation. In an era of global capital mobility, the United States faces increasing competition for retaining and attracting industries of the future and the jobs they create. My Administration is committed to enhancing the efforts of the United States to win the growing global competition for business investment by leveraging our advantages as the premier business location in the world.
<br>
<br>As a place to do business, the United States offers a hardworking, diverse, and educated workforce, strong protection of intellectual property rights, a predictable and transparent legal system, relatively low taxes, highly developed infrastructure, and access to the world's most lucrative consumer market. We welcome both domestic and foreign businesses to invest across the broad spectrum of the U.S. market.
<br>
<br>The Federal Government lacks the centralized investment promotion infrastructure and resources to attract business investment that is often found in other industrialized countries. Currently, States and cities are competing against foreign governments to attract business investment. Our Nation needs to retain business investment and pursue and win new investment in the United States by better marketing our strengths, providing clear, complete, and consistent information, and removing unnecessary obstacles to investment.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. SelectUSA Initiative. (a) Establishment. There is established the SelectUSA Initiative (Initiative), a Government-wide initiative to attract and retain investment in the American economy. The Initiative is to be housed in the Department of Commerce. The mission of this Initiative shall be to facilitate business investment in the United States in order to create jobs, spur economic growth, and promote American competitiveness. The Initiative will provide enhanced coordination of Federal activities in order to increase the impact of Federal resources that support both domestic and foreign investment in the United States. In providing assistance, the Initiative shall work to maximize impact on business investment, job creation, and economic growth. The Initiative shall work on behalf of the entire Nation and shall exercise strict neutrality with regard to specific locations within the United States.
<br>
<br>(b) Functions.
<br>
<br>(i) The Initiative shall coordinate outreach and engagement by the Federal Government to promote the United States as the premier location to operate a business.
<br>
<br>(ii) The Initiative shall serve as an ombudsman that facilitates the resolution of issues involving Federal programs or activities related to pending investments.
<br>
<br>(iii) The Initiative shall provide information to domestic and foreign firms on: the investment climate in the United States; Federal programs and incentives available to investors; and State and local economic development organizations.
<br>
<br>(iv) The Initiative shall report quarterly to the President through the National Economic Council, the Domestic Policy Council, and the National Security Staff, describing its outreach activities, requests for information received, and efforts to resolve issues.
<br>
<br>(c) Administration. The Department of Commerce shall provide funding and administrative support for the Initiative through resources and staff assigned to work on the Initiative, to the extent permitted by law and within existing appropriations. The Secretary of Commerce shall designate a senior staff member as the Executive Director to lead the Initiative. The Executive Director shall coordinate activities both within the Department of Commerce and with other executive departments and agencies that have activities relating to business investment decisions.
<br>
<br>(d) Federal Interagency Investment Working Group.
<br>
<br>(i) There is established the Federal Interagency Investment Working Group (Working Group), which will be convened and chaired by the Initiative's Executive Director, in coordination with the Director of the National Economic Council.
<br>
<br>(ii) The Working Group shall consist of senior officials from the Departments of State, the Treasury, Defense, Justice, the Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, Veterans Affairs, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Energy, Education, and Homeland Security, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Small Business Administration, the Export-Import Bank of the United States, the Office of the United States Trade Representative, the Domestic Policy Council, the National Economic Council, the National Security Staff, the Office of Management and Budget, and the Council of Economic Advisers, as well as such additional executive departments, agencies, and offices as the Secretary of Commerce may designate. Senior officials shall be designated by and report to the Deputy Secretary or official at the equivalent level of their respective offices, departments, and agencies.
<br>
<br>(iii) The Working Group shall coordinate activities to promote business investment and respond to specific issues that affect business investment decisions.
<br>
<br>(iv) The Department of Commerce shall provide funding and administrative support for the Working Group to the extent permitted by law and within existing appropriations.
<br>
<br>(e) Department and Agency Participation. All executive departments and agencies that have activities relating to business investment decisions shall cooperate with the Initiative, as requested by the Initiative's Executive Director, to support its objectives.
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
<br>
<br>(i) authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof, or the status of that department or agency within the Federal Government; or
<br>
<br>(ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
<br>
<br>(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
<br>
<br>(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

<br>It is in the national interest for the Federal Government to support innovation, global entrepreneurship, and the American private sector.

<br>
<br>(b) The Secretary shall serve as Chair of the Advisory Board. In addition to the Chair, the membership of the Advisory Board shall include the Secretary of State, the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA), and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), or their designees, and such other representatives of executive departments and agencies (agencies) as may be designated by the Secretary. Consistent with law, the Advisory Board may consult with industry, academia, and other non-federal entities to ensure that the PAGE Program is continually identifying opportunities to apply innovative practices in effective ways to promote entrepreneurship.
<br>
<br>Sec. 4. Selection of PAGE Members. (a) The Secretary, in accordance with applicable law, shall prescribe appropriate procedures for the selection of PAGE Members. PAGE Members will total no more than 25 at any given time.
<br>
<br>(b) PAGE Members may participate in the PAGE Program for periods of 2 years, and may be selected to participate for additional periods at the discretion of the Secretary.
<br>
<br>Sec. 5. Responsibilities of Agencies. The Department of State (State), USAID, and SBA are encouraged to work with the Secretary and the Advisory Board to maximize the PAGE Program's benefits to innovation, global entrepreneurship, and the American private sector through the identification of opportunities for entrepreneurs to access capital, education, mentorships, and other services that will help to grow their businesses.
<br>
<br>Sec. 6. Global Entrepreneurship Summit. (a) The Secretary of State shall coordinate the Federal Government's participation in the Global Entrepreneurship Summit (GES), which will focus on connecting entrepreneurs around the world and empowering them to expand their enterprises and build lasting relationships with the United States; increasing global economic prosperity; building secure communities; promoting responsible business conduct, including business practices to encourage greater representation of all people, including women, youth, and minorities; and using innovation to solve pressing global challenges.
<br>
<br>(b) State shall coordinate with Commerce, USAID, and SBA to identify and carry out programs and activities that will further the goals of the GES to the extent permitted by law and within existing appropriations.
<br>
