<br>
<br>(1) the initiation of a systematic review of policy prescriptions implemented by the Fund, for the purpose of determining whether the Fund's objectives were met and the social and environmental impacts of such policy prescriptions; and

<br>§286ll. Fund policy changes
<br>(a) Policy changes within IMF
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director of the Fund to promote regularly and vigorously in program discussions and quota increase negotiations the following proposals:
<br>(1) Poverty alleviation, reduction of barriers to economic and social progress, and progress toward environmentally sound policies and programs
<br>
<br>(A)(i) Considerations of poverty alleviation and the reduction of barriers to economic and social progress should be incorporated into all Fund programs and all consultations under article IV of the Articles of Agreement of the Fund.
<br>
<br>(ii) Preparation of Policy Framework Papers should be extended to all nations which have Fund programs and active Bank or International Development Association lending programs, and existence of a Policy Framework Paper should be a precondition for new lending to such nations by the Fund.
<br>
<br>(iii) All Policy Framework Papers should articulate the principal poverty, economic, and social measures that the borrowing nation needs to address, and this portion of the Policy Framework Paper (or a summary thereof that includes specific measures and timing) should be made available when the Policy Framework Paper is submitted to the Executive Directors of the Bank and of the Fund for consideration.
<br>
<br>(iv) In considering whether to allocate resources of the Fund to a borrower, the Fund should take into consideration the nature of the program and commitment of the borrower to address the issues referred to in clause (iii).
<br>
<br>(v) The Fund should establish procedures to enable the Fund to cooperate with the Bank in evaluating the effectiveness of the measures referred to in clause (iii), at the levels of policy, project design, monitoring, and reporting, in the international financial institutions and in the borrowing nations.
<br>
<br>(B)(i) The Fund should be encouraged to make further progress toward environmentally sound policies and programs.
<br>
<br>(ii) The Fund should incorporate environmental considerations into all Fund programs, including consultations under article IV of the Articles of Agreement of the Fund.
<br>
<br>(iii) The Fund should be encouraged to support the efforts of nations to implement systems of natural resource accounting in their national income accounts.
<br>
<br>(iv) The Fund should be encouraged to assist and cooperate fully with the statistical research being undertaken by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and by the United Nations in order to facilitate development and adoption of a generally applicable system for taking account of the depletion or degradation of natural resources in national income accounts.
<br>
<br>(v) The Fund should be encouraged to consider and implement, as appropriate, revisions in its national income reporting systems consistent with such new systems as are of general applicability.
<br>(2) Policy audits
<br>
<br>(A) The Fund should conduct periodic audits to review systematically the policy prescriptions recommended and required by the Fund in the areas of poverty and the environment.
<br>
<br>(B) The purposes of such audits would be—
<br>
<br>(i) to determine whether the Fund's objectives were met; and
<br>
<br>(ii) to evaluate the social and environmental impacts of the implementation of the policy prescriptions.
<br>
<br>(C) Such audits would have access to all ongoing programs and activities of the Fund and the ability to review the effects of Fund-supported programs, on a country-by-country basis, with respect to poverty, economic development, and environment.
<br>
<br>(D) Such audits should be made public as appropriate with due respect to confidentiality.
<br>(3) Ensuring policy options that increase the productive participation of the poor
<br>
<br>The Fund should establish procedures that ensure the focus of future economic reform programs approved by the Fund on policy options that increase the productive participation of the poor in the economy.
<br>(4) Public access to information
<br>
<br>(A) The Fund should establish procedures for public access to information.
<br>
<br>(B) Such procedures shall seek to ensure access of the public to information while paying due regard to appropriate confidentiality.
<br>
<br>(C) Policy Framework Papers and the supporting documents prepared by the Fund's mission to a country are examples of documents that should be made public at an appropriate time and in appropriate ways.
<br>(b) Progress report
<br>
<br>Each annual report of the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Policies shall describe the following:
<br>
<br>(1) The actions that the United States Executive Director and other officials have taken to convince the Fund to adopt the proposals set forth in subsection (a) through formal initiatives before the Board and management of the Fund, through bilateral discussions with other member nations, and through any further quota increase negotiations.
<br>
<br>(2) The status of the progress being made by the Fund in implementing the proposals set forth in subsection (a).
<br>(c) Study
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director to the Fund to urge the Fund—
<br>
<br>(1) to explore ways to increase the involvement and participation of important ministries, national development experts, environmental experts, free-market experts, and other legitimate experts and representatives from the loan-recipient country in the development of Fund programs; and
<br>
<br>(2) to report on the status of Fund efforts in this regard.

<br>
<br>The United States Executive Director of the Fund shall use the voice and vote of the United States to urge the Fund, beginning with 1994, to provide the Executive Board of the Fund with annual reports stating the estimate by the Fund of the level of military spending by each developing country in the immediately preceding calendar year (or, with respect to developing countries whose fiscal years are not calendar years, in the most recently completed fiscal year of the developing country), not later than the date of the annual fall Interim and Development Committee meetings.
<br>(c) Analysis and assessment of military spending to be included in article IV consultations by Fund
<br>

<br>§286nn. Approval of contributions for debt reductions for the poorest countries
<br>
<br>For the purpose of mobilizing the resources of the Fund in order to help reduce poverty and improve the lives of residents of poor countries and, in particular, to allow those poor countries with unsustainable debt burdens to receive deeper, broader, and faster debt relief, without allowing gold to reach the open market or otherwise adversely affecting the market price of gold, the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to instruct the United States Executive Director of the Fund to vote—
<br>
<br>(1) to approve an arrangement whereby the Fund—
<br>
<br>(A) sells a quantity of its gold at prevailing market prices to a member or members in nonpublic transactions sufficient to generate 2.226 billion Special Drawing Rights in profits on such sales;
<br>
<br>(B) immediately after, and in conjunction with each such sale, accepts payment by such member or members of such gold to satisfy existing repurchase obligations of such member or members so that the Fund retains ownership of the gold at the conclusion of such payment; and
<br>
<br>(C) uses the earnings on the investment of the profits of such sales through a separate subaccount, only for the purpose of providing debt relief from the Fund under the modified Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative (as defined in section 262p–6 of this title); and
<br>
<br>(2) to support a decision that shall terminate the Special Contingency Account 2 (SCA–2) of the Fund so that the funds in the SCA–2 shall be made available to the poorest countries. Any funds attributable to the United States participation in SCA–2 shall be used only for debt relief from the Fund under the modified HIPC Initiative.

<br>§286oo. Principles for International Monetary Fund lending
<br>
<br>It is the policy of the United States to work to implement reforms in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to achieve the following goals:
<br>(1) Short-term balance of payments financing
<br>
<br>Lending from the general resources of the Fund should concentrate chiefly on short-term balance of payments financing.
<br>(2) Limitations on medium-term financing
<br>
<br>Use of medium-term lending from the general resources of the Fund should be limited to a set of well-defined circumstances, such as—
<br>
<br>(A) when a member's balance of payments problems will be protracted;
<br>
<br>(B) such member has a strong structural reform program in place; and
<br>
<br>(C) the member has little or no access to private sources of capital.
<br>(3) Premium pricing
<br>
<br>Premium pricing should be introduced for lending from the general resources of the Fund, for greater than 200 percent of a member's quota in the Fund, to discourage excessive use of Fund lending and to encourage members to rely on private financing to the maximum extent possible.
<br>(4) Redressing misreporting of information
<br>
<br>The Fund should have in place and apply systematically a strong framework of safeguards and measures to respond to, correct, and discourage cases of misreporting of information in the context of a Fund program, including—
<br>
<br>(A) suspending Fund disbursements and ensuring that Fund lending is not resumed to members that engage in serious misreporting of material information until such time as remedial actions and sanctions, as appropriate, have been applied;
<br>
<br>(B) ensuring that members make early repayments, where appropriate, of Fund resources disbursed on the basis of misreported information;
<br>
<br>(C) making public cases of serious misreporting of material information;
<br>
<br>(D) requiring all members receiving new disbursements from the Fund to undertake annually independent audits of central bank financial statements and publish the resulting audits; and
<br>
<br>(E) requiring all members seeking new loans from the Fund to provide to the Fund detailed information regarding their internal control procedures, financial reporting and audit mechanisms and, in cases where there are questions about the adequacy of these systems, undertaking an on-site review and identifying needed remedies.

<br>
<br>(1) the Fund will provide support to low-income countries that are eligible for the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility or other low-income lending from the Fund by making available Fund resources of not less than $4,000,000,000;

<br>
<br>(4) the support provided to low-income countries occurs within six years, a substantial amount of which shall occur within the initial two years.
<br>
<br>(b) In addition to agreeing to and accepting the amendments referred to in section 286pp of this title relating to the use of proceeds from the sale of such gold, the United States Governor is authorized, consistent with subsection (a), to take such actions as may be necessary, including those referred to in section 286c(e) of this title, to also use such proceeds for the purpose of assisting low-income countries.

<br>Preventing Child Marriage in Displaced Populations
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 116–94, div. J, title IV, Dec. 20, 2019, 133 Stat. 3058, provided that:
<br>"SEC. 401. SHORT TITLE.
<br>
<br>"This title may be cited as the 'Preventing Child Marriage in Displaced Populations Act'.
<br>"SEC. 402. FINDINGS.
<br>
<br>"Congress finds the following:
<br>
<br>"(1) According to United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), 12,000,000 girls marry before the age of 18 every year.
<br>
<br>"(2) Early marriage denies children, especially girls, their right to make vital decisions about their well-being, including relating to their health, family, and career. Child brides are less likely to finish their education, and are at higher risk for abuse, contracting HIV, and dying while pregnant or giving birth.
<br>
<br>"(3) Child marriage also imposes substantial economic costs to developing countries, impeding development and prosperity gains.
<br>
<br>"(4) Displaced populations are particularly vulnerable to child marriage, in communities where poverty, instability, and displacement put pressure on families to marry children, particularly young girls, off at a young age.
<br>
<br>"(5) One United Nations (UN) study found that child marriage rates were 4 times higher among displaced Syrian refugees than among Syrians before the crisis. This indicates that displacement, instability, and poverty are driving child marriages.
<br>
<br>"(6) United Nations agencies, including UNICEF and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), have acknowledged the dangers of child marriage and taken steps to address its risk in the populations they serve.
<br>
<br>"(7) The UN Joint Program on Child Marriage supports this work by building the resilience of populations to indirectly prevent child marriage and by generating new data and evidence on the prevalence of child marriage in humanitarian and fragile settings. For example, in Uganda, the UN Joint Program on Child Marriage helped 27,000 adolescent girls strengthen critical skills through school clubs and Go Back to School campaigns, as well as life skills and financial literacy training.
<br>
<br>"(8) After the UN Joint Program on Child Marriage identified Yemen as one of its focus countries, 65,000 people, of whom 45,000 are adolescents, were reached with awareness-raising activities on the harms of child marriage in 2018 alone. As a result, local council representatives, elders, and community leaders from 6 districts signed a pledge to support advocacy efforts to end child marriage.
<br>"SEC. 403. PREVENTING CHILD MARRIAGE IN DISPLACED POPULATIONS.
<br>
<br>"(a) In General.—The President shall direct the United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations to use the voice, vote, and influence of the United States at the United Nations to call for an adoption of an agreed upon definition of 'child marriage' across United Nations agencies.
<br>
<br>"(b) Strategy.—The President shall direct the United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations to use the voice, vote, and influence of the United States at the United Nations to call for the development of a comprehensive strategy to address child marriage in refugee settlements administered by the United Nations. The strategy should include the following elements:
<br>
<br>"(1) A mandate to regularly collect and report data related to the number of known or suspected child marriages taking place inside each such settlement.
<br>
