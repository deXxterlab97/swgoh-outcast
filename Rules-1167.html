<br>Editorial Notes
<br>Codification
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 115–428, §4(j), Jan. 9, 2019, 132 Stat. 5516, substituted "DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE FOR MICRO, SMALL, AND MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES" for "MICROENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE" in subpart heading.
<br>Prior Provisions
<br>
<br>A prior subpart VI, consisting of sections 2211 to 2213, related to Alliance for Progress, prior to repeal by Pub. L. 95–424, title I, §102(g)(1)(A), title VI, §605, Oct. 6, 1978, 92 Stat. 942, 961, effective Oct. 1, 1978.
<br>Division A—Grant Assistance
<br>§2211. Findings and policy
<br>
<br>Congress finds and declares the following:
<br>
<br>(1) Access to financial services and the development of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises are vital factors in the stable growth of developing countries, in the development of free, open, and equitable international economic systems, and in the economic empowerment of the poor, especially women.
<br>
<br>(2) It is therefore in the best interest of the United States to facilitate access to financial services and assist the development of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises in developing countries, particularly enterprises owned, managed, and controlled by women.
<br>
<br>(3) Access to financial services and the development of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises can be supported by programs providing credit, savings, training, technical assistance, business development services, and other financial services.
<br>
<br>(4) Given the relatively high percentage of populations living in rural areas of developing countries, and the combined high incidence of poverty in rural areas and growing income inequality between rural and urban markets, micro, small, and medium-sized enterprise programs should target both rural and urban poor.
<br>
<br>(5) Microenterprise programs have been successful and should continue and be expanded to empower vulnerable women in the developing world. The Agency should work to ensure that recipients of development assistance for micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises under this subpart communicate and work with nongovernmental organizations and government organizations to identify and assist victims of trafficking as provided for in section 7104(a)(1) of this title and women who are victims of or susceptible to other forms of exploitation and violence.
<br>
<br>(6) Given that microenterprise programs have had some success in empowering disenfranchised groups such as women, development assistance for micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises should also target populations disenfranchised due to race or ethnicity in countries where a strong relationship between poverty and race or ethnicity has been demonstrated.
<br>

<br>Findings and Policy
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 108–484, §2, Dec. 23, 2004, 118 Stat. 3922, provided that: "Congress finds and declares the following:
<br>
<br>"(1) Congress has demonstrated its support for microenterprise development assistance programs through the enactment of two comprehensive microenterprise laws:
<br>
<br>"(A) The Microenterprise for Self-Reliance Act of 2000 (title I of Public Law 106–309; 114 Stat. 1082) [see Short Title of 2000 Amendments note set out under section 2151 of this title].
<br>
<br>"(B) Public Law 108–31 [see Tables for classification] (an Act entitled 'An Act to amend the Microenterprise for Self-Reliance Act of 2000 and the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to increase assistance for the poorest people in developing countries under microenterprise assistance program under those Acts, and for other purposes', approved June 17, 2003).
<br>
<br>"(2) The report on the effectiveness of the United States Agency for International Development's microfinance program, prepared by the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor, rated the Agency in the top tier of the 17 donors in this field.
<br>
<br>"(3) The Comptroller General, in a report dated November 2003, found that the United States Agency for International Development has met some, but not all, of the key objectives of such microenterprise development assistance programs.
<br>
<br>"(4) The Comptroller General's report found, among other things, the following:
<br>
<br>"(A) Microenterprise development assistance generally can help alleviate some impacts of poverty, improve income levels and quality of life for borrowers and provide poor individuals, workers, and their families with an important coping mechanism.
<br>
<br>"(B) Microenterprise development assistance programs of the United States Agency for International Development have encouraged women's participation in microfinance projects and, according to data of the Agency, women have comprised two-thirds or more of the micro-loan clients in Agency-funded microenterprise projects since 1997.
<br>
<br>"(5)(A) The Comptroller General's report recommends that the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development review the Agency's 'microenterprise results reporting' system with the goal of ensuring that its annual reporting is complete and accurate.
<br>
<br>"(B) Specifically, the Administrator should review and reconsider the methodologies used for the collection, analysis, and reporting of data on annual spending targets, outreach to the very poor, sustainability of microfinance institutions, and the contribution of Agency's funding to the institutions it supports."
<br>Sense of Congress
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 108–484, §7, Dec. 23, 2004, 118 Stat. 3930, provided that: "It is the sense of Congress that, in carrying out title VI of chapter 2 of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [22 U.S.C. 2211 et seq.] (as added by section 3 of this Act and amended by sections 4 through 6 of this Act), the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development—
<br>
<br>"(1) where applicable, should ensure that microenterprise development assistance provided under such title is matched by recipients with an equal amount of assistance from non-United States Government sources, including private donations, multilateral funding, commercial and concessional borrowing, savings, and program income;
<br>
<br>"(2) should include in the report required by section 258 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [22 U.S.C. 2214] (as added by section 6 of this Act) a description of all matching assistance (as described in paragraph (1)) provided for the prior year by recipients of microenterprise development assistance under such title;
<br>
<br>"(3) should ensure that recipients of microenterprise development assistance under such title do not expend an unreasonably large percentage of such assistance on administrative costs;
<br>
<br>"(4) should not use recipients of microenterprise development assistance under such title to carry out critical management functions of the Agency, including functions such as strategy development or overall management of programs in a country; and
<br>
<br>"(5) should consult with the appropriate congressional committees with respect to the implementation of title VI of chapter 2 of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act [Dec. 23, 2004]."

<br>Division B—Credit Assistance
<br>§2212. Development credits for micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises
<br>(a) Findings and policy
<br>
<br>Congress finds and declares that—
<br>
<br>(1) the development of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises is a vital factor in the stable growth of developing countries and in the development and stability of a free, open, and equitable international economic system; and
<br>
<br>(2) it is, therefore, in the best interests of the United States to assist the access to financial services and the development of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises in developing countries and to engage the United States private sector in that process.
<br>(b) Program
<br>
<br>To carry out the policy set forth in subsection (a), the President is authorized to provide assistance to increase the availability of financial services to micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises and households lacking full access to credit and other financial services, including through—
<br>
<br>(1) loans and guarantees to financial intermediaries for the purpose of expanding the availability of savings and credit to poor and low-income households;
<br>
<br>(2) training programs for financial intermediaries in order to enable them to better meet the financial services needs of their clients; and
<br>
<br>(3) training programs for clients in order to enable them to make better use of credit, increase their financial literacy, and to better manage their enterprises to improve their quality of life.
<br>(c) Eligibility criteria
<br>
<br>The Administrator of the Agency shall establish criteria for determining which financial intermediaries described in subsection (b)(1) are eligible to carry out activities, with respect to micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises and households, assisted under this section. Such criteria may include the following:
<br>
<br>(1) The extent to which the recipients of financial services from the entity do not have access to the local formal financial sector.
<br>
<br>(2) The extent to which the recipients of financial services from the entity are among the poorest people in the country.
<br>
<br>(3) The extent to which the entity is oriented toward working directly with poor women.
<br>
<br>(4) The extent to which the entity recovers its cost of lending.
<br>
<br>(5) The extent to which the entity implements a plan to become financially sustainable.
<br>(d) Additional requirement
<br>
<br>Assistance provided under this section may only be used to support programs for micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises and households and may not be used to support programs not directly related to the purposes described in subsection (b).
<br>(e) Procurement provision
<br>
<br>Assistance may be provided under this section without regard to section 2354(a) of this title.
<br>(f) Availability of funds
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Of the amounts authorized to be available to carry out subchapter I of this chapter, there are authorized to be available such sums as may be necessary for each of the fiscal years 2005 through 2009 to carry out this section.
<br>(2) Coverage of subsidy costs
<br>
<br>Amounts authorized to be available under paragraph (1) shall be made available to cover the subsidy cost, as defined in section 661a(5) of title 2, for activities under this section.

<br>Findings and Declarations of Policy of 2000 Amendment
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 106–309, title I, §102, Oct. 17, 2000, 114 Stat. 1079, provided that: "Congress makes the following findings and declarations:
<br>
<br>"(1) According to the World Bank, more than 1,200,000,000 people in the developing world, or one-fifth of the world's population, subsist on less than $1 a day.
<br>
<br>"(2) Over 32,000 of their children die each day from largely preventable malnutrition and disease.
<br>
<br>"(3)(A) Women in poverty generally have larger work loads and less access to educational and economic opportunities than their male counterparts.
<br>
<br>"(B) Directly aiding the poorest of the poor, especially women, in the developing world has a positive effect not only on family incomes, but also on child nutrition, health and education, as women in particular reinvest income in their families.
<br>
<br>"(4)(A) The poor in the developing world, particularly women, generally lack stable employment and social safety nets.
<br>
<br>"(B) Many turn to self-employment to generate a substantial portion of their livelihood. In Africa, over 80 percent of employment is generated in the informal sector of the self-employed poor.
<br>
<br>"(C) These poor entrepreneurs are often trapped in poverty because they cannot obtain credit at reasonable rates to build their asset base or expand their otherwise viable self-employment activities.
<br>
<br>"(D) Many of the poor are forced to pay interest rates as high as 10 percent per day to money lenders.
<br>
<br>"(5)(A) The poor are able to expand their incomes and their businesses dramatically when they can access loans at reasonable interest rates.
<br>
<br>"(B) Through the development of self-sustaining microfinance programs, poor people themselves can lead the fight against hunger and poverty.
<br>
<br>"(6)(A) On February 2–4, 1997, a global Microcredit Summit was held in Washington, District of Columbia, to launch a plan to expand access to credit for self-employment and other financial and business services to 100,000,000 of the world's poorest families, especially the women of those families, by 2005. While this scale of outreach may not be achievable in this short time-period, the realization of this goal could dramatically alter the face of global poverty.
<br>
<br>"(B) With an average family size of five, achieving this goal will mean that the benefits of microfinance will thereby reach nearly half of the world's more than 1,000,000,000 absolute poor people.
<br>
<br>"(7)(A) Nongovernmental organizations, such as those that comprise the Microenterprise Coalition (such as the Grameen Bank (Bangladesh), K–REP (Kenya), and networks such as Accion International, the Foundation for International Community Assistance (FINCA), and the credit union movement) are successful in lending directly to the very poor.
<br>
<br>"(B) Microfinance institutions such as BRAC (Bangladesh), BancoSol (Bolivia), SEWA Bank (India), and ACEP (Senegal) are regulated financial institutions that can raise funds directly from the local and international capital markets.
<br>
<br>"(8)(A) Microenterprise institutions not only reduce poverty, but also reduce the dependency on foreign assistance.
<br>
<br>"(B) Interest income on the credit portfolio is used to pay recurring institutional costs, assuring the long-term sustainability of development assistance.
<br>
<br>"(9) Microfinance institutions leverage foreign assistance resources because loans are recycled, generating new benefits to program participants.
<br>
<br>"(10)(A) The development of sustainable microfinance institutions that provide credit and training, and mobilize domestic savings, is a critical component to a global strategy of poverty reduction and broad-based economic development.
<br>
<br>"(B) In the efforts of the United States to lead the development of a new global financial architecture, microenterprise should play a vital role. The recent shocks to international financial markets demonstrate how the financial sector can shape the destiny of nations. Microfinance can serve as a powerful tool for building a more inclusive financial sector which serves the broad majority of the world's population including the very poor and women and thus generate more social stability and prosperity.
<br>
<br>"(C) Over the last two decades, the United States has been a global leader in promoting the global microenterprise sector, primarily through its development assistance programs at the United States Agency for International Development. Additionally, the Department of the Treasury and the Department of State have used their authority to promote microenterprise in the development programs of international financial institutions and the United Nations.
<br>
<br>"(11)(A) In 1994, the United States Agency for International Development launched the 'Microenterprise Initiative' in partnership with the Congress.
<br>
<br>"(B) The initiative committed to expanding funding for the microenterprise programs of the Agency, and set a goal that, by the end of fiscal year 1996, one-half of all microenterprise resources would support programs and institutions that provide credit to the poorest, with loans under $300.
<br>
<br>"(C) In order to achieve the goal of the microcredit summit, increased investment in microfinance institutions serving the poorest will be critical.
<br>
<br>"(12) Providing the United States share of the global investment needed to achieve the goal of the microcredit summit will require only a small increase in United States funding for international microcredit programs, with an increased focus on institutions serving the poorest.
<br>
<br>"(13)(A) In order to reach tens of millions of the poorest with microcredit, it is crucial to expand and replicate successful microfinance institutions.
<br>
<br>"(B) These institutions need assistance in developing their institutional capacity to expand their services and tap commercial sources of capital.
<br>
<br>"(14) Nongovernmental organizations have demonstrated competence in developing networks of local microfinance institutions and other assistance delivery mechanisms so that they reach large numbers of the very poor, and achieve financial sustainability.
<br>
<br>"(15) Recognizing that the United States Agency for International Development has developed very effective partnerships with nongovernmental organizations, and that the Agency will have fewer missions overseas to carry out its work, the Agency should place priority on investing in those nongovernmental network institutions that meet performance criteria through the central funding mechanisms of the Agency.
<br>
<br>"(16) By expanding and replicating successful microfinance institutions, it should be possible to create a global infrastructure to provide financial services to the world's poorest families.
<br>
<br>"(17)(A) The United States can provide leadership to other bilateral and multilateral development agencies as such agencies expand their support to the microenterprise sector.
<br>
<br>"(B) The United States should seek to improve coordination among G–7 countries in the support of the microenterprise sector in order to leverage the investment of the United States with that of other donor nations.
<br>
<br>"(18) Through increased support for microenterprise, especially credit for the poorest, the United States can continue to play a leadership role in the global effort to expand financial services and opportunity to 100,000,000 of the poorest families on the planet."

<br>subpart xii—famine prevention and freedom from hunger
<br>§2220a. General provisions
<br>(a) Congressional objectives and findings
<br>
<br>The Congress declares that, in order to achieve the mutual goals among nations of ensuring food security, human health, agricultural growth, trade expansion, and the wise and sustainable use of natural resources, the United States should mobilize the capacities of the United States land-grant universities, other eligible universities, and public and private partners of universities in the United States and other countries, consistent with sections 2151a and 2151a–1 of this title, for: (1) global research on problems affecting food, agriculture, forestry, and fisheries; (2) improved human capacity and institutional resource development for the global application of agricultural and related environmental sciences; (3) agricultural development and trade research and extension services in the United States and other countries to support the entry of rural industries into world markets; and (4) providing for the application of agricultural sciences to solving food, health, nutrition, rural income, and environmental problems, especially such problems in low-income, food deficit countries.
<br>
<br>The Congress so declares because it finds—
<br>
<br>(A) that the establishment, endowment, and continuing support of land-grant universities in the United States by Federal, State, and county governments has led to agricultural progress with and through the private sector in this country and to understanding processes of economic development;
<br>
<br>(B) that land-grant and other universities in the United States have demonstrated over many years their ability to cooperate with international agencies, educational and research institutions in other countries, the private sector, and nongovernmental organizations worldwide, in expanding global agricultural production, processing, business and trade, to the benefit of aid recipient countries and of the United States;
<br>
<br>(C) that, in a world of growing populations with rising expectations, increased food production and improved distribution, storage, and marketing in the developing countries is necessary not only to prevent hunger and ensure human health and child survival, but to build the basis for economic growth and trade, and the social security in which democracy and a market economy can thrive, and moreover, that the greatest potential for increasing world food supplies and incomes to purchase food is in the developing countries where the gap between food need and food supply is the greatest and current incomes are lowest;
<br>
<br>(D) that increasing and making more secure the supply of food is of greatest benefit to the poorest majority in the developing world;
<br>
<br>(E) that, with expanding global markets and increasing imports into many countries, including the United States, food safety and quality, as well as secure supply, have emerged as mutual concerns of all countries;
<br>
<br>(F) that research, teaching, and extension activities, and appropriate institutional and policy development therefore are prime factors in improving agricultural production, food distribution, processing, storage, and marketing abroad (as well as in the United States);
<br>
<br>(G) moreover, that agricultural research abroad has in the past and will continue in the future to provide benefits for agriculture and the broader economy of the United States and that increasing the availability of food of higher nutritional quality is of benefit to all;
<br>
<br>(H) that there is a need to responsibly manage the world's agricultural and natural resources for sustained productivity, health and resilience to climate variability; and
<br>
<br>(I) that universities and public and private partners of universities need a dependable source of funding in order to increase the impact of their own investments and those of their State governments and constituencies, in order to continue and expand their efforts to advance agricultural development in cooperating countries, to translate development into economic growth and trade for the United States and cooperating countries, and to prepare future teachers, researchers, extension specialists, entrepreneurs, managers, and decisionmakers for the world economy.
<br>(b) Congressional declaration for collation of components to increase world food production
<br>
<br>Accordingly, the Congress declares that, in order to prevent famine and establish freedom from hunger, the following components must be brought together in a coordinated program to increase world food and fiber production, agricultural trade, and responsible management of natural resources, including—
<br>
<br>(1) continued efforts by the international agricultural research centers and other international research entities to provide a global network, including United States universities, for international scientific collaboration on crops, livestock, forests, fisheries, farming resources, and food systems of worldwide importance;
<br>
<br>(2) contract research and the implementation of collaborative research support programs and other research collaboration led by United States universities, and involving research systems in other countries focused on crops, livestock, forests, fisheries, farming resources, and food systems, with benefits to the United States and partner countries;
<br>
<br>(3) broadly disseminating the benefits of global agricultural research and development including increased benefits for United States agriculturally related industries through establishment of development and trade information and service centers, for rural as well as urban communities, through extension, cooperatively with, and supportive of, existing public and private trade and development related organizations;
<br>
<br>(4) facilitation of participation by universities and public and private partners of universities in programs of multilateral banks and agencies which receive United States funds;
<br>
<br>(5) expanding learning opportunities about global agriculture for students, teachers, community leaders, entrepreneurs, and the general public through international internships and exchanges, graduate assistantships, faculty positions, and other means of education and extension through long-term recurring Federal funds matched by State funds; and
<br>
<br>(6) competitive grants through universities to United States agriculturalists and public and private partners of universities from other countries for research, institution and policy development, extension, training, and other programs for global agricultural development, trade, and responsible management of natural resources.
<br>(c) University involvement, participation, and cooperation
<br>
<br>The United States should—
<br>
<br>(1) effectively involve the United States land-grant and other eligible universities more extensively in each of the program components described in paragraphs (1) through (6) of subsection (b);
<br>
<br>(2) provide mechanisms for the universities and public and private partners of universities to participate and advise in the planning, development, implementation, and administration of each component;
<br>
<br>(3) assist such universities and public and private partners of universities in cooperative joint efforts with—
<br>
<br>(A) agricultural institutions in developing nations;
<br>
<br>(B) regional and international agricultural research centers;
<br>
<br>(C) multilateral banks and agencies receiving United States funds;
<br>
<br>(D) development agencies of other countries; and
<br>
<br>(E) United States Government foreign assistance and economic cooperation programs;
<br>
