<br>§3690. Overcharges by educational institutions; discontinuance of allowances; examination of records; false or misleading statements
<br>
<br>(a) Overcharges by Educational Institutions.—If the Secretary finds that an educational institution has—
<br>
<br>(1) charged or received from any eligible veteran or eligible person pursuing a program of education under this chapter or chapter 34 or 35 of this title any amount for any course in excess of the charges for tuition and fees which such institution requires similarly circumstanced nonveterans not receiving assistance under such chapters who are enrolled in the same course to pay, or
<br>
<br>(2) instituted, after October 24, 1972, a policy or practice with respect to the payment of tuition, fees, or other charges in the case of eligible veterans and the Secretary finds that the effect of such policy or practice substantially denies to veterans the benefits of the advance allowances under such section,
<br>
<br>the Secretary may disapprove such educational institution for the enrollment of any eligible veteran or eligible person not already enrolled therein under this chapter or chapter 31, 34, or 35 of this title.
<br>
<br>(b) Discontinuance of Allowances.—(1) The Secretary may discontinue the educational assistance allowance of any eligible veteran or eligible person if the Secretary finds that the program of education or any course in which the veteran or person is enrolled fails to meet any of the requirements of this chapter or chapter 34 or 35 of this title, or if the Secretary finds that the educational institution offering such program or course has violated any provision of this chapter or chapter 34 or 35 of this title, or fails to meet any of the requirements of such chapters.
<br>
<br>(2) Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, any action by the Secretary under paragraph (1) of this subsection to discontinue (including to suspend) assistance provided to any eligible veteran or eligible person under this chapter or chapter 31, 32, 34, or 35 of this title shall be based upon evidence that the veteran or eligible person is not or was not entitled to such assistance. Whenever the Secretary so discontinues any such assistance, the Secretary shall concurrently provide written notice to such veteran or person of such discontinuance and that such veteran or person is entitled thereafter to a statement of the reasons for such action and an opportunity to be heard thereon.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) The Secretary may suspend educational assistance to eligible veterans and eligible persons already enrolled, and may disapprove the enrollment or reenrollment of any eligible veteran or eligible person, in any course as to which the Secretary has evidence showing a substantial pattern of eligible veterans or eligible persons, or both, who are receiving such assistance by virtue of their enrollment in such course but who are not entitled to such assistance because (i) the course approval requirements of this chapter are not being met, or (ii) the educational institution offering such course has violated one or more of the recordkeeping or reporting requirements of this chapter or chapter 30, 32, 33, 34, or 35 of this title.
<br>
<br>(B) Action may be taken under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph only after—
<br>
<br>(i) the Secretary provides to the State approving agency concerned and the educational institution concerned written notice of any such failure to meet such approval requirements and any such violation of such recordkeeping or reporting requirements;
<br>
<br>(ii) such institution refuses to take corrective action or does not within 60 days after such notice (or within such longer period as the Secretary determines is reasonable and appropriate) take corrective action; and
<br>
<br>(iii) the Secretary, not less than 30 days before taking action under such subparagraph, provides to each eligible veteran and eligible person already enrolled in such course written notice of the Secretary's intent to take such action (and the reasons therefor) unless such corrective action is taken within such 60 days (or within such longer period as the Secretary has determined is reasonable and appropriate), and of the date on which the Secretary intends to take action under such subparagraph.
<br>
<br>(c) Examination of Records.—Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the records and accounts of educational institutions pertaining to eligible veterans or eligible persons who received educational assistance under this chapter or chapter 31, 32, 34, or 35 of this title, as well as the records of other students which the Secretary determines necessary to ascertain institutional compliance with the requirements of such chapters, shall be available for examination by duly authorized representatives of the Government.
<br>
<br>(d) False or Misleading Statements.—Whenever the Secretary finds that an educational institution has willfully submitted a false or misleading claim, or that a veteran or person, with the complicity of an educational institution, has submitted such a claim, the Secretary shall make a complete report of the facts of the case to the appropriate State approving agency and, where deemed advisable, to the Attorney General of the United States for appropriate action.

<br>
<br>(a) Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section, each eligible veteran and eligible person may make not more than one change of program of education, but an eligible veteran or eligible person whose program has been interrupted or discontinued due to the veteran's or person's own misconduct, the veteran's or person's own neglect, or the veteran's or person's own lack of application shall not be entitled to any such change.
<br>
<br>(b) The Secretary, in accordance with procedures that the Secretary may establish, may approve a change other than a change under subsection (a) of this section (or an initial change in the case of a veteran or person not eligible to make a change under subsection (a)) in program if the Secretary finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) the program of education which the eligible veteran or eligible person proposes to pursue is suitable to the veteran's or person's aptitudes, interests, and abilities; and
<br>
<br>(2) in any instance where the eligible veteran or eligible person has interrupted, or failed to progress in, the veteran's or person's program due to the veteran's or person's own misconduct, the veteran's or person's own neglect, or the veteran's or person's own lack of application, there exists a reasonable likelihood with respect to the program which the eligible veteran or eligible person proposes to pursue that there will not be a recurrence of such an interruption or failure to progress.
<br>
<br>(c) The Secretary may also approve additional changes in program if the Secretary finds such changes are necessitated by circumstances beyond the control of the eligible veteran or eligible person.
<br>
<br>(d)(1) For the purposes of this section, the term "change of program of education" shall not be deemed to include a change by a veteran or eligible person from the pursuit of one program to the pursuit of another program if—
<br>
<br>(A) the veteran or eligible person has successfully completed the former program;
<br>
<br>(B) the program leads to a vocational, educational, or professional objective in the same general field as the former program;
<br>
<br>(C) the former program is a prerequisite to, or generally required for, pursuit of the subsequent program;
<br>
<br>(D) in the case of a change from the pursuit of a subsequent program to the pursuit of a former program, the veteran or eligible person resumes pursuit of the former program without loss of credit or standing in the former program; or
<br>
<br>(E) the change from the program to another program is at the same educational institution and such educational institution determines that the new program is suitable to the aptitudes, interests, and abilities of the veteran or eligible person and certifies to the Secretary the enrollment of the veteran or eligible person in the new program.
<br>
<br>(2) A veteran or eligible person undergoing a change from one program of education to another program of education as described in paragraph (1)(E) shall not be required to apply to the Secretary for approval of such change.

<br>
<br>(i) Publish a caution flag on the GI Bill Comparison Tool, or successor tool, about that educational institution and alert its currently enrolled eligible veterans and eligible persons.
<br>

<br>
<br>(B) In deciding upon a course of action under subparagraph (A), for the first violation of this section, the Secretary shall consider the factors set forth in paragraph (2).

<br>
<br>(2) The factors set forth in this paragraph are the following:
<br>

<br>(B) That the educational institution has secured an approved third-party auditor to verify the educational institution's, or owner's, advertising and enrollment practices for at least three years going forward.
<br>

<br>
<br>(4) No action may be carried out under this subsection with respect to a final determination by the Under Secretary under subsection (g) while such final determination is pending review under subsection (i).
<br>

<br>
<br>(2)(A) The Secretary shall—
<br>
<br>(i) review each final determination for which a review is requested under paragraph (1); and
<br>
<br>(ii) pursuant to such review, issue a final decision sustaining, modifying, or overturning the final determination.
<br>
<br>(B) The Secretary may not delegate any decision under subparagraph (A).
<br>

<br>
<br>(ii) A decision issued pursuant to a review under subparagraph (A)(i) may not be appealed to the Secretary for review under section 7104(a) of this title.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) Not later than 30 days after the date on which the Secretary issues a final decision under paragraph (2)(A)(ii), the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report on such final decision.
<br>
<br>(B) A report submitted under subparagraph (A) shall include the following:

<br>
<br>(iii) Materials that were submitted to the Secretary after the date of the final determination under subsection (g) that was the subject of the final decision under paragraph (2)(A)(ii) of this subsection and before the date on which the Secretary issued such final decision.
<br>
<br>(j) Reinstatement of Approval.—(1) If an educational institution or the owner of an educational institution has had the approval of the courses or programs of education of the educational institution suspended as described in clause (ii) of subsection (h)(1)(A) or revoked as described in clause (iii) of such subsection for a violation of subsection (a), (c), or (d) pursuant to subparagraph (C) or (D) of subsection (h)(1), the educational institution or owner may submit to the applicable State approving agency or the Secretary when acting as a State approving agency an application for reinstatement of approval under this subsection.
<br>
<br>(2) Approval under this chapter may not be reinstated under this subsection until—
<br>
<br>(A) the educational institution or owner submits to the applicable State approving agency or the Secretary when acting as a State approving agency an application for reinstatement of approval under paragraph (1);

<br>
<br>(D) procedures are in place to prevent any future violation of subsection (a), (c), or (d);
<br>
<br>(E) that [sic] the educational institution has met all factors set forth in subsection (h)(2); and
<br>
<br>(F) the Secretary agrees to such reinstatement.
<br>
<br>(k) Rule of Construction Regarding State Approving Agencies and Risk-based Surveys.—Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a State approving agency from conducting any risk-based survey the State approving agency considers appropriate at any educational institution that it considers appropriate for oversight purposes.
<br>
<br>(l) Definitions.—In this section:
<br>
<br>(1) The term "approved third-party auditor" means an independent third-party auditor that is approved by the Secretary for purposes of third-party audits under this section.
