<br>Part C—Specific Bureau Authorities
<br>§5531. Prohibiting unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>The Bureau may take any action authorized under part E to prevent a covered person or service provider from committing or engaging in an unfair, deceptive, or abusive act or practice under Federal law in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service.
<br>(b) Rulemaking
<br>
<br>The Bureau may prescribe rules applicable to a covered person or service provider identifying as unlawful unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service. Rules under this section may include requirements for the purpose of preventing such acts or practices.
<br>(c) Unfairness
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Bureau shall have no authority under this section to declare an act or practice in connection with a transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service, to be unlawful on the grounds that such act or practice is unfair, unless the Bureau has a reasonable basis to conclude that—
<br>
<br>(A) the act or practice causes or is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers which is not reasonably avoidable by consumers; and
<br>
<br>(B) such substantial injury is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or to competition.
<br>(2) Consideration of public policies
<br>
<br>In determining whether an act or practice is unfair, the Bureau may consider established public policies as evidence to be considered with all other evidence. Such public policy considerations may not serve as a primary basis for such determination.
<br>(d) Abusive
<br>
<br>The Bureau shall have no authority under this section to declare an act or practice abusive in connection with the provision of a consumer financial product or service, unless the act or practice—
<br>
<br>(1) materially interferes with the ability of a consumer to understand a term or condition of a consumer financial product or service; or
<br>
<br>(2) takes unreasonable advantage of—
<br>
<br>(A) a lack of understanding on the part of the consumer of the material risks, costs, or conditions of the product or service;
<br>
<br>(B) the inability of the consumer to protect the interests of the consumer in selecting or using a consumer financial product or service; or
<br>
<br>(C) the reasonable reliance by the consumer on a covered person to act in the interests of the consumer.
<br>(e) Consultation
<br>
<br>In prescribing rules under this section, the Bureau shall consult with the Federal banking agencies, or other Federal agencies, as appropriate, concerning the consistency of the proposed rule with prudential, market, or systemic objectives administered by such agencies.
<br>(f) Consideration of seasonal income
<br>
<br>The rules of the Bureau under this section shall provide, with respect to an extension of credit secured by residential real estate or a dwelling, if documented income of the borrower, including income from a small business, is a repayment source for an extension of credit secured by residential real estate or a dwelling, the creditor may consider the seasonality and irregularity of such income in the underwriting of and scheduling of payments for such credit.

<br>(d) Safe harbor
<br>
<br>Any covered person that uses a model form included with a rule issued under this section shall be deemed to be in compliance with the disclosure requirements of this section with respect to such model form.

<br>(3) Public disclosure
<br>
<br>The rules of the Bureau shall provide for public disclosure of trial disclosure programs, which public disclosure may be limited, to the extent necessary to encourage covered persons to conduct effective trials.
<br>(f) Combined mortgage loan disclosure
<br>

<br>
<br>(2) The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection shall enforce the rules issued under paragraph (1) in the same manner, by the same means, and with the same jurisdiction, powers, and duties, as though all applicable terms and provisions of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 were incorporated into and made part of this subsection.

<br>
<br>(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (6), in any case in which the attorney general of a State has reason to believe that an interest of the residents of the State has been or is threatened or adversely affected by the engagement of any person subject to a rule prescribed under subsection (a) in practices that violate such rule, the State, as parens patriae, may bring a civil action on behalf of its residents in an appropriate district court of the United States or other court of competent jurisdiction—
<br>
<br>(A) to enjoin that practice;
<br>
<br>(B) to enforce compliance with the rule;
<br>
<br>(C) to obtain damages, restitution, or other compensation on behalf of the residents of the State; or

<br>(D) to obtain penalties and relief provided under the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010, the Federal Trade Commission Act [15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.], and such other relief as the court deems appropriate.
<br>
<br>(2) The State shall serve written notice to the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection or the Commission, as appropriate 1 of any civil action under paragraph (1) at least 60 days prior to initiating such civil action. The notice shall include a copy of the complaint to be filed to initiate such civil action, except that if it is not feasible for the State to provide such prior notice, the State shall provide notice immediately upon instituting such civil action.
<br>
<br>(3) Upon receiving the notice required by paragraph (2), and subject to subtitle B of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 [12 U.S.C. 5511 et seq.], the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection or the Commission, as appropriate 1 may intervene in such civil action and upon intervening—
<br>
<br>(A) be heard on all matters arising in such civil action;
<br>
<br>(B) remove the action to the appropriate United States district court; and
<br>
<br>(C) file petitions for appeal of a decision in such civil action.
<br>
<br>(4) Nothing in this subsection shall prevent the attorney general of a State from exercising the powers conferred on the attorney general by the laws of such State to conduct investigations or to administer oaths or affirmations or to compel the attendance of witnesses or the production of documentary and other evidence. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the attorney general of a State, or other authorized State officer, from proceeding in State or Federal court on the basis of an alleged violation of any civil or criminal statute of that State.
<br>
<br>(5) In a civil action brought under paragraph (1)—
<br>
<br>(A) the venue shall be a judicial district in which the defendant is found, is an inhabitant, or transacts business or wherever venue is proper under section 1391 of title 28; and
<br>
<br>(B) process may be served without regard to the territorial limits of the district or of the State in which the civil action is instituted.
<br>
<br>(6) Whenever a civil action or an administrative action has been instituted by or on behalf of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection or the Commission for violation of any provision of law or rule described in paragraph (1), no State may, during the pendency of such action instituted by or on behalf of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection or the Commission, institute a civil action under that paragraph against any defendant named in the complaint in such action for violation of any law or rule as alleged in such complaint.
<br>
<br>(7) If the attorney general of a State prevails in any civil action under paragraph (1), the State can recover reasonable costs and attorney fees from the lender or related party.

<br>
<br>For purposes of this subsection, a statute, regulation, order, or interpretation in effect in any State is not inconsistent with the provisions of this title 1 if the protection that such statute, regulation, order, or interpretation affords to consumers is greater than the protection provided under this title.1 A determination regarding whether a statute, regulation, order, or interpretation in effect in any State is inconsistent with the provisions of this title 1 may be made by the Bureau on its own motion or in response to a nonfrivolous petition initiated by any interested person.
<br>(b) Relation to other provisions of enumerated consumer laws that relate to State law
<br>
<br>No provision of this title,1 except as provided in section 1083,1 shall be construed as modifying, limiting, or superseding the operation of any provision of an enumerated consumer law that relates to the application of a law in effect in any State with respect to such Federal law.

<br>(2) Bureau considerations required for issuance of final regulation
<br>
<br>Before prescribing a final regulation based upon a notice issued pursuant to paragraph (1), the Bureau shall take into account whether—
<br>
<br>(A) the proposed regulation would afford greater protection to consumers than any existing regulation;

<br>(3) Explanation of considerations
<br>
<br>The Bureau—

<br>(A) shall include a discussion of the considerations required in paragraph (2) in the Federal Register notice of a final regulation prescribed pursuant to this subsection; and

<br>(4) Reservation of authority
<br>
<br>No provision of this subsection shall be construed as limiting or restricting the authority of the Bureau to enhance consumer protection standards established pursuant to this title 1 in response to its own motion or in response to a request by any other interested person.
