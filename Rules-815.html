<br>Based on sections 595, 1125, and 1315 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking (Dec. 23, 1913, ch. 6, §22, first sentence of second paragraph, 38 Stat. 272; July 17, 1916, ch. 245, §211(e), as added Mar. 4, 1923, ch. 252, §2, 42 Stat. 1460; June 21, 1917, ch. 32, §11, 40 Stat. 240; Sept. 26, 1918, ch. 177, §5, part 22(c), 40 Stat. 970; Mar. 4, 1923, ch. 252, title II, §216(e), 42 Stat. 1472).
<br>
<br>The punishment provisions of the three sections were identical, and all other provisions thereof were similar, except that section 595 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, relating to officers, directors, employees, or attorneys of member banks of the Federal Reserve System, did not include the terms "agent" and "acceptance" and did not include the phrase "or extension or renewal of loan or substitution of security".
<br>
<br>Words "shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor" were omitted because of definition of misdemeanor in section 1 of this title.
<br>
<br>Words "and upon conviction" and "and shall upon conviction thereof" were omitted as surplusage because punishment cannot be imposed until after conviction.

<br>
<br>(e) Venue.—With respect to an offense under this section, an action may be inquired of and prosecuted in a district court of the United States for—
<br>
<br>(1) the district in which the child who is the subject of the support obligation involved resided during a period during which a person described in subsection (a) (referred to in this subsection as an "obliger") failed to meet that support obligation;

L. 104–294, title VI, §§604(b)(14)(A), 607(a), Oct. 11, 1996, 110 Stat. 3507, 3511.)
<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §51 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §19, 35 Stat. 1092).
<br>
<br>Clause making conspirator ineligible to hold office was omitted as incongruous because it attaches ineligibility to hold office to a person who may be a private citizen and who was convicted of conspiracy to violate a specific statute. There seems to be no reason for imposing such a penalty in the case of one individual crime, in view of the fact that other crimes do not carry such a severe consequence. The experience of the Department of Justice is that this unusual penalty has been an obstacle to successful prosecutions for violations of the act.
<br>
<br>Mandatory punishment provision was rephrased in the alternative.
<br>
<br>Minor changes in phraseology were made.
