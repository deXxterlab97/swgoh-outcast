<br>
<br>There shall be implemented by each United States district court, in accordance with this chapter, a civil justice expense and delay reduction plan. The plan may be a plan developed by such district court or a model plan developed by the Judicial Conference of the United States. The purposes of each plan are to facilitate deliberate adjudication of civil cases on the merits, monitor discovery, improve litigation management, and ensure just, speedy, and inexpensive resolutions of civil disputes.

<br>Congressional Statement of Findings
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 101–650, title I, §102, Dec. 1, 1990, 104 Stat. 5089, provided that: "The Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>"(1) The problems of cost and delay in civil litigation in any United States district court must be addressed in the context of the full range of demands made on the district court's resources by both civil and criminal matters.
<br>
<br>"(2) The courts, the litigants, the litigants' attorneys, and the Congress and the executive branch, share responsibility for cost and delay in civil litigation and its impact on access to the courts, adjudication of cases on the merits, and the ability of the civil justice system to provide proper and timely judicial relief for aggrieved parties.
<br>
<br>"(3) The solutions to problems of cost and delay must include significant contributions by the courts, the litigants, the litigants' attorneys, and by the Congress and the executive branch.
<br>
<br>"(4) In identifying, developing, and implementing solutions to problems of cost and delay in civil litigation, it is necessary to achieve a method of consultation so that individual judicial officers, litigants, and litigants' attorneys who have developed techniques for litigation management and cost and delay reduction can effectively and promptly communicate those techniques to all participants in the civil justice system.
<br>
<br>"(5) Evidence suggests that an effective litigation management and cost and delay reduction program should incorporate several interrelated principles, including—
<br>
<br>"(A) the differential treatment of cases that provides for individualized and specific management according to their needs, complexity, duration, and probable litigation careers;
<br>
<br>"(B) early involvement of a judicial officer in planning the progress of a case, controlling the discovery process, and scheduling hearings, trials, and other litigation events;
<br>
<br>"(C) regular communication between a judicial officer and attorneys during the pretrial process; and
<br>
<br>"(D) utilization of alternative dispute resolution programs in appropriate cases.
<br>
<br>"(6) Because the increasing volume and complexity of civil and criminal cases imposes increasingly heavy workload burdens on judicial officers, clerks of court, and other court personnel, it is necessary to create an effective administrative structure to ensure ongoing consultation and communication regarding effective litigation management and cost and delay reduction principles and techniques."

<br>
<br>(2) In developing its recommendations, the advisory group of a district court shall take into account the particular needs and circumstances of the district court, litigants in such court, and the litigants' attorneys.

<br>§473. Content of civil justice expense and delay reduction plans
<br>
<br>(a) In formulating the provisions of its civil justice expense and delay reduction plan, each United States district court, in consultation with an advisory group appointed under section 478 of this title, shall consider and may include the following principles and guidelines of litigation management and cost and delay reduction:
<br>
<br>(1) systematic, differential treatment of civil cases that tailors the level of individualized and case specific management to such criteria as case complexity, the amount of time reasonably needed to prepare the case for trial, and the judicial and other resources required and available for the preparation and disposition of the case;
<br>
<br>(2) early and ongoing control of the pretrial process through involvement of a judicial officer in—
<br>
<br>(A) assessing and planning the progress of a case;
<br>
<br>(B) setting early, firm trial dates, such that the trial is scheduled to occur within eighteen months after the filing of the complaint, unless a judicial officer certifies that—
<br>
<br>(i) the demands of the case and its complexity make such a trial date incompatible with serving the ends of justice; or
<br>
<br>(ii) the trial cannot reasonably be held within such time because of the complexity of the case or the number or complexity of pending criminal cases;
<br>
<br>(C) controlling the extent of discovery and the time for completion of discovery, and ensuring compliance with appropriate requested discovery in a timely fashion; and
<br>
<br>(D) setting, at the earliest practicable time, deadlines for filing motions and a time framework for their disposition;
<br>
<br>(3) for all cases that the court or an individual judicial officer determines are complex and any other appropriate cases, careful and deliberate monitoring through a discovery-case management conference or a series of such conferences at which the presiding judicial officer—
<br>
<br>(A) explores the parties' receptivity to, and the propriety of, settlement or proceeding with the litigation;
<br>
<br>(B) identifies or formulates the principal issues in contention and, in appropriate cases, provides for the staged resolution or bifurcation of issues for trial consistent with Rule 42(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure;
<br>
<br>(C) prepares a discovery schedule and plan consistent with any presumptive time limits that a district court may set for the completion of discovery and with any procedures a district court may develop to—
<br>
<br>(i) identify and limit the volume of discovery available to avoid unnecessary or unduly burdensome or expensive discovery; and
<br>
<br>(ii) phase discovery into two or more stages; and
<br>
<br>(D) sets, at the earliest practicable time, deadlines for filing motions and a time framework for their disposition;
<br>
<br>(4) encouragement of cost-effective discovery through voluntary exchange of information among litigants and their attorneys and through the use of cooperative discovery devices;
<br>
<br>(5) conservation of judicial resources by prohibiting the consideration of discovery motions unless accompanied by a certification that the moving party has made a reasonable and good faith effort to reach agreement with opposing counsel on the matters set forth in the motion; and
<br>
<br>(6) authorization to refer appropriate cases to alternative dispute resolution programs that—
<br>
<br>(A) have been designated for use in a district court; or
<br>
<br>(B) the court may make available, including mediation, minitrial, and summary jury trial.
<br>
<br>(b) In formulating the provisions of its civil justice expense and delay reduction plan, each United States district court, in consultation with an advisory group appointed under section 478 of this title, shall consider and may include the following litigation management and cost and delay reduction techniques:
<br>
<br>(1) a requirement that counsel for each party to a case jointly present a discovery-case management plan for the case at the initial pretrial conference, or explain the reasons for their failure to do so;
<br>
<br>(2) a requirement that each party be represented at each pretrial conference by an attorney who has the authority to bind that party regarding all matters previously identified by the court for discussion at the conference and all reasonably related matters;
<br>
<br>(3) a requirement that all requests for extensions of deadlines for completion of discovery or for postponement of the trial be signed by the attorney and the party making the request;
<br>
<br>(4) a neutral evaluation program for the presentation of the legal and factual basis of a case to a neutral court representative selected by the court at a nonbinding conference conducted early in the litigation;
<br>
<br>(5) a requirement that, upon notice by the court, representatives of the parties with authority to bind them in settlement discussions be present or available by telephone during any settlement conference; and
<br>
<br>(6) such other features as the district court considers appropriate after considering the recommendations of the advisory group referred to in section 472(a) of this title.
<br>
<br>(c) Nothing in a civil justice expense and delay reduction plan relating to the settlement authority provisions of this section shall alter or conflict with the authority of the Attorney General to conduct litigation on behalf of the United States, or any delegation of the Attorney General.

<br>The title of the position was changed to "Assistant Attorney General for Administration" by §307 of the Act of Aug. 14, 1964, Pub. L. 88–426, 78 Stat. 432.
<br>
<br>The words "competitive service" are substituted for "classified civil service" because the term "classified civil service" formerly used to designate the merit system established by the Civil Service Act of 1883 has become ambiguous due to the creation of the "classified" pay system. The term "competitive service" is now customarily used, and appears throughout title 5, United States Code, in place of "classified civil service".
<br>
<br>The words "There shall be in the Department of Justice" are omitted as unnecessary as the title of the position and the fact of appointment by the Attorney General establish the location of the position in the Department of Justice.
<br>
<br>The last 12 words of section 5 of the Reorganization Plan are omitted on authority of the Act of June 5, 1952, ch. 369, §1101 (3d proviso), 66 Stat. 121. The salary of the position is now fixed by §303(e) of the Act of Aug. 14, 1964, Pub. L. 88–426, 78 Stat. 420, which is codified in section 5316 of title 5, United States Code.
