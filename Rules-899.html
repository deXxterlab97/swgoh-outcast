<br>SUBTITLE IV—COUNTERVAILING AND ANTIDUMPING DUTIES
<br>Part I—Imposition of Countervailing Duties
<br>Codification
<br>
<br>The designations "SUBTITLE IV" and "Part I" were in the original "TITLE VII" and "Subtitle A" respectively, and were editorially changed in order to conform the numbering format of this subtitle to the usages employed in the codification of the remainder of the Tariff Act of 1930 as originally enacted.
<br>§1671. Countervailing duties imposed
<br>(a) General rule
<br>
<br>If—
<br>
<br>(1) the administering authority determines that the government of a country or any public entity within the territory of a country is providing, directly or indirectly, a countervailable subsidy with respect to the manufacture, production, or export of a class or kind of merchandise imported, or sold (or likely to be sold) for importation, into the United States, and
<br>
<br>(2) in the case of merchandise imported from a Subsidies Agreement country, the Commission determines that—
<br>
<br>(A) an industry in the United States—
<br>
<br>(i) is materially injured, or
<br>
<br>(ii) is threatened with material injury, or
<br>
<br>(B) the establishment of an industry in the United States is materially retarded,
<br>
<br>by reason of imports of that merchandise or by reason of sales (or the likelihood of sales) of that merchandise for importation,
<br>
<br>then there shall be imposed upon such merchandise a countervailing duty, in addition to any other duty imposed, equal to the amount of the net countervailable subsidy. For purposes of this subsection and section 1671d(b)(1) of this title, a reference to the sale of merchandise includes the entering into of any leasing arrangement regarding the merchandise that is equivalent to the sale of the merchandise.
<br>(b) Subsidies Agreement country
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subtitle, the term "Subsidies Agreement country" means—
<br>
<br>(1) a WTO member country,
<br>
<br>(2) a country which the President has determined has assumed obligations with respect to the United States which are substantially equivalent to the obligations under the Subsidies Agreement, or
<br>
<br>(3) a country with respect to which the President determines that—
<br>
<br>(A) there is an agreement in effect between the United States and that country which—
<br>
<br>(i) was in force on December 8, 1994, and
<br>
<br>(ii) requires unconditional most-favored-nation treatment with respect to articles imported into the United States, and
<br>
<br>(B) the agreement described in subparagraph (A) does not expressly permit—
<br>
<br>(i) actions required or permitted by the GATT 1947 or GATT 1994, as defined in section 3501(1) of this title, or required by the Congress, or
<br>
<br>(ii) nondiscriminatory prohibitions or restrictions on importation which are designed to prevent deceptive or unfair practices.
<br>(c) Countervailing duty investigations involving imports not entitled to a material injury determination
<br>
<br>In the case of any article or merchandise imported from a country which is not a Subsidies Agreement country—
<br>
<br>(1) no determination by the Commission under section 1671b(a), 1671c, or 1671d(b) of this title shall be required,
<br>
<br>(2) an investigation may not be suspended under section 1671c(c) or 1671c(l) of this title,
<br>
<br>(3) no determination as to the presence of critical circumstances shall be made under section 1671b(e) or 1671d(a)(2) of this title,
<br>
<br>(4) section 1671e(c) of this title shall not apply,
<br>
<br>(5) any reference to a determination described in paragraph (1) or (3), or to the suspension of an investigation under section 1671c(c) or 1671c(l) of this title, shall be disregarded, and
<br>
<br>(6) section 1675(c) of this title shall not apply.
<br>(d) Treatment of international consortia
<br>
<br>For purposes of this part, if the members (or other participating entities) of an international consortium that is engaged in the production of subject merchandise receive countervailable subsidies from their respective home countries to assist, permit, or otherwise enable their participation in that consortium through production or manufacturing operations in their respective home countries, then the administering authority shall cumulate all such countervailable subsidies, as well as countervailable subsidies provided directly to the international consortium, in determining any countervailing duty upon such merchandise.
<br>(e) Upstream subsidies
<br>
<br>Whenever the administering authority has reasonable grounds to believe or suspect that an upstream subsidy, as defined in section 1677–1(a)(1) 1 of this title, is being paid or bestowed, the administering authority shall investigate whether an upstream subsidy has in fact been paid or bestowed, and if so, shall include the amount of the upstream subsidy as provided in section 1677–1(a)(3) 2 of this title.
<br>(f) Applicability to proceedings involving nonmarket economy countries
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in paragraph (2), the merchandise on which countervailing duties shall be imposed under subsection (a) includes a class or kind of merchandise imported, or sold (or likely to be sold) for importation, into the United States from a nonmarket economy country.
<br>(2) Exception
<br>
<br>A countervailing duty is not required to be imposed under subsection (a) on a class or kind of merchandise imported, or sold (or likely to be sold) for importation, into the United States from a nonmarket economy country if the administering authority is unable to identify and measure subsidies provided by the government of the nonmarket economy country or a public entity within the territory of the nonmarket economy country because the economy of that country is essentially comprised of a single entity.

<br>In any case in which the administering authority is required to poll or otherwise determine support for the petition by the industry under paragraph (4)(D), the administering authority may, in exceptional circumstances, apply subparagraph (A) by substituting "a maximum of 40 days" for "20 days".
<br>(C) Time limits where petition involves same merchandise as an order that has been revoked
<br>
<br>If a petition is filed under this section with respect to merchandise that was the subject merchandise of—
<br>
<br>(i) a countervailing duty order that was revoked under section 1675(d) of this title in the 24 months preceding the date the petition is filed, or
<br>
<br>(ii) a suspended investigation that was terminated under section 1675(d) of this title in the 24 months preceding the date the petition is filed,
<br>
<br>the administering authority and the Commission shall, to the maximum extent practicable, expedite any investigation initiated under this section with respect to the petition.
<br>(2) Affirmative determinations
<br>
<br>If the determinations under clauses (i) and (ii) of paragraph (1)(A) are affirmative, the administering authority shall initiate an investigation to determine whether a countervailable subsidy is being provided with respect to the subject merchandise.
<br>(3) Negative determinations
<br>
<br>If the determination under clause (i) or (ii) of paragraph (1)(A) is negative, the administering authority shall dismiss the petition, terminate the proceeding, and notify the petitioner in writing of the reasons for the determination.
<br>(4) Determination of industry support
<br>(A) General rule
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subsection, the administering authority shall determine that the petition has been filed by or on behalf of the industry, if—
<br>
<br>(i) the domestic producers or workers who support the petition account for at least 25 percent of the total production of the domestic like product, and
<br>
<br>(ii) the domestic producers or workers who support the petition account for more than 50 percent of the production of the domestic like product produced by that portion of the industry expressing support for or opposition to the petition.
<br>(B) Certain positions disregarded
<br>(i) Producers related to foreign producers
<br>
<br>In determining industry support under subparagraph (A), the administering authority shall disregard the position of domestic producers who oppose the petition, if such producers are related to foreign producers, as defined in section 1677(4)(B)(ii) of this title, unless such domestic producers demonstrate that their interests as domestic producers would be adversely affected by the imposition of a countervailing duty order.
<br>(ii) Producers who are importers
<br>
<br>The administering authority may disregard the position of domestic producers of a domestic like product who are importers of the subject merchandise.
<br>(C) Special rule for regional industries
<br>
<br>If the petition alleges that the industry is a regional industry, the administering authority shall determine whether the petition has been filed by or on behalf of the industry by applying subparagraph (A) on the basis of production in the region.
<br>(D) Polling the industry
<br>
<br>If the petition does not establish support of domestic producers or workers accounting for more than 50 percent of the total production of the domestic like product, the administering authority shall—
<br>
<br>(i) poll the industry or rely on other information in order to determine if there is support for the petition as required by subparagraph (A), or
<br>
<br>(ii) if there is a large number of producers in the industry, the administering authority may determine industry support for the petition by using any statistically valid sampling method to poll the industry.
<br>(E) Comments by interested parties
<br>
<br>Before the administering authority makes a determination with respect to initiating an investigation, any person who would qualify as an interested party under section 1677(9) of this title if an investigation were initiated, may submit comments or information on the issue of industry support. After the administering authority makes a determination with respect to initiating an investigation, the determination regarding industry support shall not be reconsidered.
<br>(5) "Domestic producers or workers" defined
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subsection, the term "domestic producers or workers" means those interested parties who are eligible to file a petition under subsection (b)(1).
<br>(d) Notification to Commission of determination
<br>
<br>The administering authority shall—
<br>
<br>(1) notify the Commission immediately of any determination it makes under subsection (a) or (c) of this section, and
<br>
<br>(2) if the determination is affirmative, make available to the Commission such information as it may have relating to the matter under investigation, under such procedures as the administering authority and the Commission may establish to prevent disclosure, other than with the consent of the party providing it or under protective order, of any information to which confidential treatment has been given by the administering authority.
<br>(e) Information regarding critical circumstances
<br>
<br>If, at any time after the initiation of an investigation under this part, the administering authority finds a reasonable basis to suspect that the alleged countervailable subsidy is inconsistent with the Subsidies Agreement, the administering authority may request the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection to compile information on an expedited basis regarding entries of the subject merchandise. Upon receiving such request, the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection shall collect information regarding the volume and value of entries of the subject merchandise and shall transmit such information to the administering authority at such times as the administering authority shall direct (at least once every 30 days), until a final determination is made under section 1671d(a) of this title, the investigation is terminated, or the administering authority withdraws the request.

<br>§1671b. Preliminary determinations
<br>(a) Determination by Commission of reasonable indication of injury
<br>(1) General rule
<br>
<br>Except in the case of a petition dismissed by the administering authority under section 1671a(c)(3) of this title, the Commission, within the time specified in paragraph (2), shall determine, based on the information available to it at the time of the determination, whether there is a reasonable indication that—
<br>
<br>(A) an industry in the United States—
<br>
<br>(i) is materially injured, or
<br>
<br>(ii) is threatened with material injury, or
<br>
<br>(B) the establishment of an industry in the United States is materially retarded,
<br>
<br>by reason of imports of the subject merchandise and that imports of the subject merchandise are not negligible. If the Commission finds that imports of the subject merchandise are negligible or otherwise makes a negative determination under this paragraph, the investigation shall be terminated.
<br>(2) Time for Commission determination
<br>
<br>The Commission shall make the determination described in paragraph (1)—
<br>
<br>(A) in the case of a petition filed under section 1671a(b) of this title—
<br>
<br>(i) within 45 days after the date on which the petition is filed, or
<br>
<br>(ii) if the time has been extended pursuant to section 1671a(c)(1)(B) of this title, within 25 days after the date on which the Commission receives notice from the administering authority of initiation of the investigation, and
<br>
<br>(B) in the case of an investigation initiated under section 1671a(a) of this title, within 45 days after the date on which the Commission receives notice from the administering authority that an investigation has been initiated under such section.
<br>(b) Preliminary determination by administering authority; expedited determinations; waiver of verification
<br>
<br>(1) Within 65 days after the date on which the administering authority initiates an investigation under section 1671a(c) of this title, or an investigation is initiated under section 1671a(a) of this title, but not before an affirmative determination by the Commission under subsection (a) of this section, the administering authority shall make a determination, based upon the information available to it at the time of the determination, of whether there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that a countervailable subsidy is being provided with respect to the subject merchandise.
<br>
<br>(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), when the petition is one subject to section 1671a(b)(3) of this title, the Administering Authority shall, taking into account the nature of the countervailable subsidy concerned, make the determination required by paragraph (1) on an expedited basis and within 65 days after the date on which the administering authority initiates an investigation under section 1671a(c) of this title unless the provisions of subsection (c) of this section apply.
<br>
<br>(3) Within 55 days after the initiation of an investigation the administering authority shall cause an official designated for such purpose to review the information concerning the case received during the first 50 days of the investigation, and, if there appears to be sufficient information available upon which the determination can reasonably be based, to disclose to the petitioner and any interested party, then a party to the proceedings that requests such disclosure, all available nonconfidential information and all other information which is disclosed pursuant to section 1677f of this title. Within 3 days (not counting Saturdays, Sundays, or legal public holidays) after such disclosure, the petitioner and each party which is an interested party described in subparagraph (C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) of section 1677(9) of this title to whom such disclosure was made may furnish to the administering authority an irrevocable written waiver of verification of the information received by the authority, and an agreement that it is willing to have a determination made on the basis of the record then available to the authority. If a timely waiver and agreement have been received from the petitioner and each party which is an interested party described in subparagraph (C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) of section 1677(9) of this title to whom the disclosure was made, and the authority finds that sufficient information is then available upon which the preliminary determination can reasonably be based, a preliminary determination shall be made on an expedited basis on the basis of the record established during the first 50 days after the investigation was initiated.
<br>
<br>(4) De minimis countervailable subsidy.—
<br>
<br>(A) General rule.—In making a determination under this subsection, the administering authority shall disregard any de minimis countervailable subsidy. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a countervailable subsidy is de minimis if the administering authority determines that the aggregate of the net countervailable subsidies is less than 1 percent ad valorem or the equivalent specific rate for the subject merchandise.
<br>
<br>(B) Exception for developing countries.—In the case of subject merchandise imported from a Subsidies Agreement country (other than a country to which subparagraph (C) applies) designated by the Trade Representative as a developing country in accordance with section 1677(36) of this title, a countervailable subsidy is de minimis if the administering authority determines that the aggregate of the net countervailable subsidies does not exceed 2 percent ad valorem or the equivalent specific rate for the subject merchandise.
<br>
<br>(C) Certain other developing countries.—In the case of subject merchandise imported from a Subsidies Agreement country that is—
<br>
<br>(i) a least developed country, as determined by the Trade Representative in accordance with section 1677(36) of this title, or
<br>
<br>(ii) a developing country with respect to which the Trade Representative has notified the administering authority that the country has eliminated its export subsidies on an expedited basis within the meaning of Article 27.11 of the Subsidies Agreement,
<br>
<br>subparagraph (B) shall be applied by substituting "3 percent" for "2 percent".
<br>
<br>(D) Limitations on application of subparagraph (C).—
<br>
<br>(i) In general.—In the case of a country described in subparagraph (C)(i), the provisions of subparagraph (C) shall not apply after the date that is 8 years after the date the WTO Agreement enters into force.
<br>
<br>(ii) Special rule for subparagraph (C)(ii) countries.—In the case of a country described in subparagraph (C)(ii), the provisions of subparagraph (C) shall not apply after the earlier of—
<br>
<br>(I) the date that is 8 years after the date the WTO Agreement enters into force, or
<br>
<br>(II) the date on which the Trade Representative notifies the administering authority that such country is providing an export subsidy.
<br>
<br>(5) Notification of article 8 violation.—If the only subsidy under investigation is a subsidy with respect to which the administering authority received notice from the Trade Representative of a violation of Article 8 of the Subsidies Agreement, paragraph (1) shall be applied by substituting "60 days" for "65 days".
<br>(c) Extension of period in extraordinarily complicated cases
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>If—
<br>
<br>(A) the petitioner makes a timely request for an extension of the period within which the determination must be made under subsection (b), or
<br>
<br>(B) the administering authority concludes that the parties concerned are cooperating and determines that—
<br>
<br>(i) the case is extraordinarily complicated by reason of—
<br>
<br>(I) the number and complexity of the alleged countervailable subsidy practices;
<br>
<br>(II) the novelty of the issues presented;
<br>
<br>(III) the need to determine the extent to which particular countervailable subsidies are used by individual manufacturers, producers, and exporters; or
<br>
<br>(IV) the number of firms whose activities must be investigated; and
<br>
<br>(ii) additional time is necessary to make the preliminary determination,
<br>
<br>then the administering authority may postpone making the preliminary determination under subsection (b) until not later than the 130th day after the date on which the administering authority initiates an investigation under section 1671a(c) of this title, or an investigation is initiated under section 1671a(a) of this title.
<br>(2) Notice of postponement
<br>
<br>The administering authority shall notify the parties to the investigation, not later than 20 days before the date on which the preliminary determination would otherwise be required under subsection (b), if it intends to postpone making the preliminary determination under paragraph (1). The notification shall include an explanation of the reasons for the postponement. Notice of the postponement shall be published in the Federal Register.
<br>(d) Effect of determination by the administering authority
<br>
<br>If the preliminary determination of the administering authority under subsection (b) is affirmative, the administering authority—
<br>
<br>(1)(A) shall—
<br>
<br>(i) determine an estimated individual countervailable subsidy rate for each exporter and producer individually investigated, and, in accordance with section 1671d(c)(5) of this title, an estimated all-others rate for all exporters and producers not individually investigated and for new exporters and producers within the meaning of section 1675(a)(2)(B) of this title, or
<br>
<br>(ii) if section 1677f–1(e)(2)(B) of this title applies, determine a single estimated country-wide subsidy rate, applicable to all exporters and producers, and
<br>
<br>(B) shall order the posting of a cash deposit, bond, or other security, as the administering authority deems appropriate, for each entry of the subject merchandise in an amount based on the estimated individual countervailable subsidy rate, the estimated all-others rate, or the estimated country-wide subsidy rate, whichever is applicable,
<br>
<br>(2) shall order the suspension of liquidation of all entries of merchandise subject to the determination which are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the later of—
<br>
<br>(A) the date on which notice of the determination is published in the Federal Register, or
<br>
<br>(B) the date that is 60 days after the date on which notice of the determination to initiate the investigation is published in the Federal Register, and
<br>
<br>(3) shall make available to the Commission all information upon which its determination was based and which the Commission considers relevant to its injury determination, under such procedures as the administering authority and the Commission may establish to prevent disclosure, other than with the consent of the party providing it or under protective order, of any information to which confidential treatment has been given by the administering authority.
<br>
<br>The instructions of the administering authority under paragraphs (1) and (2) may not remain in effect for more than 4 months.
<br>(e) Critical circumstances determinations
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>If a petitioner alleges critical circumstances in its original petition, or by amendment at any time more than 20 days before the date of a final determination by the administering authority, then the administering authority shall promptly (at any time after the initiation of the investigation under this part) determine, on the basis of the information available to it at that time, whether there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that—
<br>
<br>(A) the alleged countervailable subsidy is inconsistent with the Subsidies Agreement, and
<br>
<br>(B) there have been massive imports of the subject merchandise over a relatively short period.
<br>(2) Suspension of liquidation
<br>
<br>If the determination of the administering authority under paragraph (1) is affirmative, then any suspension of liquidation ordered under subsection (d)(2) shall apply, or, if notice of such suspension of liquidation is already published, be amended to apply, to unliquidated entries of merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the later of—
<br>
<br>(A) the date which is 90 days before the date on which the suspension of liquidation was first ordered, or
<br>
<br>(B) the date on which notice of the determination to initiate the investigation is published in the Federal Register.
<br>(f) Notice of determination
<br>
<br>Whenever the Commission or the administering authority makes a determination under this section, the Commission or the administering authority, as the case may be, shall notify the petitioner, and other parties to the investigation, and the Commission or the administering authority (whichever is appropriate) of its determination. The administering authority shall include with such notification the facts and conclusions on which its determination is based. Not later than 5 days after the date on which the determination is required to be made under subsection (a)(2), the Commission shall transmit to the administering authority the facts and conclusions on which its determination is based.
<br>(g) Time period where upstream subsidization is involved
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Whenever the administering authority concludes prior to a preliminary determination under subsection (b), that there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that an upstream subsidy is being bestowed, the time period within which a preliminary determination must be made shall be extended to 250 days after the filing of a petition under section 1671a(b) of this title or initiation of an investigation under section 1671a(a) of this title (310 days in cases declared extraordinarily complicated under subsection (c)), if the administering authority concludes that such additional time is necessary to make the required determination concerning upstream subsidization.
<br>(2) Exceptions
<br>
<br>Whenever the administering authority concludes, after a preliminary determination under subsection (b), that there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that an upstream subsidy is being bestowed—
<br>
<br>(A) in cases in which the preliminary determination was negative, the time period within which a final determination must be made shall be extended to 165 or 225 days, as appropriate, under section 1671d(a)(1) of this title; or
<br>
<br>(B) in cases in which the preliminary determination is affirmative, the determination concerning upstream subsidization—
<br>
<br>(i) need not be made until the conclusion of the first annual review under section 1675 of this title of any eventual Countervailing Duty Order, or, at the option of the petitioner, or
<br>
<br>(ii) will be made in the investigation and the time period within which a final determination must be made shall be extended to 165 or 225 days, as appropriate, under section 1671d(a)(1) of this title, as appropriate,1 except that the suspension of liquidation ordered in the preliminary determination shall terminate at the end of 120 days from the date of publication of that determination and not be resumed unless and until the publication of a Countervailing Duty Order under section 1671e(a) of this title.
<br>
<br>There may be an extension of time for the making of a final determination under this subsection only if the administering authority determines that such additional time is necessary to make the required determination concerning upstream subsidization.

<br>§1671c. Termination or suspension of investigation
<br>(a) Termination of investigation upon withdrawal of petition
<br>(1) In general
<br>(A) Withdrawal of petition
<br>
<br>Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), an investigation under this part may be terminated by either the administering authority or the Commission, after notice to all parties to the investigation, upon withdrawal of the petition by the petitioner or by the administering authority if the investigation was initiated under section 1671a(a) of this title.
<br>(B) Refiling of petition
<br>
<br>If, within 3 months after the withdrawal of a petition under subparagraph (A), a new petition is filed seeking the imposition of duties on both the subject merchandise of the withdrawn petition and the subject merchandise from another country, the administering authority and the Commission may use in the investigation initiated pursuant to the new petition any records compiled in an investigation conducted pursuant to the withdrawn petition. This subparagraph applies only with respect to the first withdrawal of a petition.
<br>(2) Special rules for quantitative restriction agreements
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C), the administering authority may not terminate an investigation under paragraph (1) by accepting, with the government of the country in which the countervailable subsidy practice is alleged to occur, an understanding or other kind of agreement to limit the volume of imports into the United States of the subject merchandise unless the administering authority is satisfied that termination on the basis of that agreement is in the public interest.
<br>(B) Public interest factors
<br>
<br>In making a decision under subparagraph (A) regarding the public interest, the administering authority shall take into account—
<br>
<br>(i) whether, based upon the relative impact on consumer prices and the availability of supplies of the merchandise, the agreement would have a greater adverse impact on United States consumers than the imposition of countervailing duties;
<br>
<br>(ii) the relative impact on the international economic interests of the United States; and
<br>
<br>(iii) the relative impact on the competitiveness of the domestic industry producing the like merchandise, including any such impact on employment and investment in that industry.
<br>(C) Prior consultations
<br>
<br>Before making a decision under subparagraph (A) regarding the public interest, the administering authority shall, to the extent practicable, consult with—
<br>
<br>(i) potentially affected consuming industries; and
<br>
<br>(ii) potentially affected producers and workers in the domestic industry producing the like merchandise, including producers and workers not party to the investigation.
<br>(3) Limitation on termination by Commission
<br>
<br>The Commission may not terminate an investigation under paragraph (1) before a preliminary determination is made by the administering authority under section 1671b(b) of this title.
<br>(b) Agreements to eliminate or offset completely a countervailable subsidy or to cease exports of subject merchandise
<br>
<br>The administering authority may suspend an investigation if the government of the country in which the countervailable subsidy practice is alleged to occur agrees, or exporters who account for substantially all of the imports of the subject merchandise agree—
<br>
<br>(1) to eliminate the countervailable subsidy completely or to offset completely the amount of the net countervailable subsidy, with respect to that merchandise exported directly or indirectly to the United States, within 6 months after the date on which the investigation is suspended, or
<br>
<br>(2) to cease exports of that merchandise to the United States within 6 months after the date on which the investigation is suspended.
<br>(c) Agreements eliminating injurious effect
<br>(1) General rule
<br>
<br>If the administering authority determines that extraordinary circumstances are present in a case, it may suspend an investigation upon the acceptance of an agreement from a government described in subsection (b), or from exporters described in subsection (b), if the agreement will eliminate completely the injurious effect of exports to the United States of the subject merchandise.
<br>(2) Certain additional requirements
<br>
<br>Except in the case of an agreement by a foreign government to restrict the volume of imports of the subject merchandise into the United States, the administering authority may not accept an agreement under this subsection unless—
<br>
<br>(A) the suppression or undercutting of price levels of domestic products by imports of that merchandise will be prevented, and
<br>
<br>(B) at least 85 percent of the net countervailable subsidy will be offset.
<br>(3) Quantitative restrictions agreements
<br>
<br>The administering authority may accept an agreement with a foreign government under this subsection to restrict the volume of imports of subject merchandise into the United States, but it may not accept such an agreement with exporters.
<br>(4) Definition of extraordinary circumstances
<br>(A) Extraordinary circumstances
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subsection, the term "extraordinary circumstances" means circumstances in which—
<br>
<br>(i) suspension of an investigation will be more beneficial to the domestic industry than continuation of the investigation, and
<br>
<br>(ii) the investigation is complex.
<br>(B) Complex
<br>
<br>For purposes of this paragraph, the term "complex" means—
<br>
<br>(i) there are a large number of alleged countervailable subsidy practices and the practices are complicated,
<br>
<br>(ii) the issues raised are novel, or
<br>
<br>(iii) the number of exporters involved is large.
<br>(d) Additional rules and conditions
<br>(1) Public interest; monitoring
<br>
<br>The administering authority shall not accept an agreement under subsection (b) or (c) unless—
<br>
<br>(A) it is satisfied that suspension of the investigation is in the public interest, and
<br>
<br>(B) effective monitoring of the agreement by the United States is practicable.
<br>
<br>Where practicable, the administering authority shall provide to the exporters who would have been subject to the agreement the reasons for not accepting the agreement and, to the extent possible, an opportunity to submit comments thereon. In applying subparagraph (A) with respect to any quantitative restriction agreement under subsection (c), the administering authority shall take into account, in addition to such other factors as are considered necessary or appropriate, the factors set forth in subsection (a)(2)(B)(i), (ii), and (iii) as they apply to the proposed suspension and agreement, after consulting with the appropriate consuming industries, producers, and workers referred to in subsection (a)(2)(C)(i) and (ii).
<br>(2) Exports of merchandise to United States not to increase during interim period
<br>
<br>The administering authority may not accept any agreement under subsection (b) unless that agreement provides a means of ensuring that the quantity of the merchandise covered by that agreement exported to the United States during the period provided for elimination or offset of the countervailable subsidy or cessation of exports does not exceed the quantity of such merchandise exported to the United States during the most recent representative period determined by the administering authority.
<br>(3) Regulations governing entry or withdrawals
<br>
<br>In order to carry out an agreement concluded under subsection (b) or (c), the administering authority is authorized to prescribe regulations governing the entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption of subject merchandise.
<br>(e) Suspension of investigation procedure
<br>
<br>Before an investigation may be suspended under subsection (b) or (c) the administering authority shall—
<br>
<br>(1) notify the petitioner of, and consult with the petitioner concerning, its intention to suspend the investigation, and notify other parties to the investigation and the Commission not less than 30 days before the date on which it suspends the investigation,
<br>
<br>(2) provide a copy of the proposed agreement to the petitioner at the time of the notification, together with an explanation of how the agreement will be carried out and enforced (including any action required of foreign governments), and of how the agreement will meet the requirements of subsections (b) and (d) or (c) and (d), and
<br>
<br>(3) permit all interested parties described in section 1677(9) of this title to submit comments and information for the record before the date on which notice of suspension of the investigation is published under subsection (f)(1)(A).
<br>(f) Effects of suspension of investigation
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>If the administering authority determines to suspend an investigation upon acceptance of an agreement described in subsection (b) or (c), then—
<br>
<br>(A) it shall suspend the investigation, publish notice of suspension of the investigation, and issue an affirmative preliminary determination under section 1671b(b) of this title with respect to the subject merchandise, unless it has previously issued such a determination in the same investigation,
