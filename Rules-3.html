<br>keep, between Me and you and thy seed after thee: every male among you shall be circumcised. 11And ye shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of a covenant betwixt Me and you. 12And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every male throughout your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any foreigner, that is not of thy seed. 13He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised; and My covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant. 14And the uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken My covenant.’
<br>15And God said unto Abraham: ‘As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but bSarah shall her name be. 16And I will bless her, and moreover I will give thee a son of her; yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of peoples shall be of her.’ 17Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart: ‘Shall a child be born unto him that is a hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?’ 18And Abraham said unto God: ‘Oh that Ishmael might live before Thee! ’ 19And God said: ‘‘Nay, but Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son;
<br> 
<br>
<br>
<br> 	 
<br>a Heb. Ab hamon.	b That is, Princess.
<br> 
<br>and thou shalt call his name aIsaac; and I will establish My covenant with him for an everlasting covenant for his seed after him. 20And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee; behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation. 21But My covenant will I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.’ 22And He left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham. 23And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham’s house, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him. 24And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. 25And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. 26In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son. 27And all the men of his house, those born in the house, and those bought with money of a foreigner, were circumcised with him.

<br>And the LORD appeared unto him	by	the	terebinths	of
<br>
<br>
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Mamre, as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day; 2and he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood over against him; and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed down to the earth, 3and said: ‘My lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant. 4Let now a little water be fetched, and wash your feet, and recline yourselves under the tree. 5And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and stay ye your heart; after that ye shall pass on; forasmuch as ye are come to your servant.’ And they said: ‘So do, as thou hast said.’ 6And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said: ‘Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes.’ 7And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetched a calf tender and good, and gave it unto the servant; and he hastened to dress it. 8And he took curd, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat. 9And they said unto him: ‘Where is Sarah thy wife?’ And he said: ‘Behold, in the tent.’ 10And He said: ‘I will certainly return unto thee when the season cometh round; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son.’ And Sarah heard in the tent door, which was behind him.—11Now Abraham and Sarah were old, and well stricken in age; it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of
<br>

<br> 
<br>women.—12And Sarah laughed within
<br> 
<br>herself, saying: ‘After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?’ 13And the LORD said unto Abraham: ‘Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying: Shall I of a surety bear a child, who am old? 14Is any thing too hard for the LORD. At the set time I will return unto thee, when the season cometh round, and Sarah shall have a son.’ 15Then Sarah denied, saying: ‘I laughed not’; for she was afraid. And He said: ‘Nay; but thou didst laugh.’
<br>16And the men rose up from thence, and looked out toward Sodom; and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way. 17And the LORD said: ‘Shall I hide from Abraham that which I am doing; 18seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him? 19For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of the LORD, to do righteousness and justice; to the end that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which He hath spoken of him.’ 20And the LORD said: ‘Verily, the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and, verily, their sin is exceeding grievous. 21I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto Me; and if not, I will know.’ 22And the men turned from thence, and went toward Sodom; but Abraham stood yet before the LORD. 23And Abraham drew near, and said:
<br> 
<br>‘Wilt Thou indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked? 24Peradventure there are fifty righteous within the city; wilt Thou indeed sweep away and not forgive the place for the fifty righteous that are therein? 25That be far from Thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked, that so the righteous should be as the wicked; that be far from Thee; shall not the judge of all the earth do justly?’ 26And the LORD said: ‘If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will forgive all the place for their sake.’ 27And Abraham answered and said: ‘Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, who am but dust and ashes. 28Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous; wilt Thou destroy all the city for lack of five?’ And He said: ‘I will not destroy it, if I find there forty and five.’ 29And he spoke unto Him yet again, and said: ‘Peradventure there shall be forty found there.’ And He said: ‘I will not do it for the forty’s sake.’ 30And he said: ‘Oh, let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak. Peradventure there shall thirty be found there.’ And He said: ‘I will not do it, if I find thirty there.’ 31And he said: ‘Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord. Peradventure there shall be twenty found there.’ And He said: ‘I will not destroy it for the twenty’s sake.’ 32And he said: ‘Oh, let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once. Peradventure ten shall be
<br> 
<br>found there.’ And He said: ‘I will not destroy it for the ten’s sake.’ 33And the LORD went His way, as soon as He had left off speaking to Abraham; and Abraham returned unto his place.
<br>And the two angels came to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in
<br>the gate of Sodom; and Lot saw them, and rose up to meet them; and he fell down on his face to the earth; 2and he said: ‘Behold now, my lords, turn aside, I pray you, into your servant’s house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your way.’ And they said: ‘Nay; but we will abide in the broad place all night.’ 3And he urged them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat. 4But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both young and old, all the people from every quarter. 5And they called unto Lot, and said unto him: ‘Where are the men that came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.’ 6And Lot went out unto them to the door, and shut the door after him. 7And he said: ‘I pray you, my brethren, do not so wickedly. 8Behold now, I have two daughters that have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes; only unto these men do nothing; forasmuch as they are come under the
<br> 
<br>shadow of my roof.’ 9And they said: ‘Stand back.’ And they said: ‘This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs play the judge; now will we deal worse with thee, than with them.’ And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and drew near to break the door. 10But the men put forth their hand, and brought Lot into the house to them, and the door they shut. 11And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great; so that they wearied themselves to find the door. 12And the men said unto Lot: ‘Hast thou here any besides? son-in-law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whomsoever thou hast in the city; bring them out of the place; 13for we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxed great before the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.’ 14And Lot went out, and spoke unto his sons-in-law, who married his daughters, and said: ‘Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy the city.’ But he seemed unto his sons-in-law as one that jested. 15And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying: ‘Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters that are here; lest thou be swept away in the iniquity of the city.’ 16But he lingered; and the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him. And they brought him forth, and set him without the city. 17And it came to pass, when they had
<br> 
<br>brought them forth abroad, that he said: ‘Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the Plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be swept away.’ 18And Lot said unto them: ‘Oh, not so, my lord; 19behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shown unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest the evil overtake me, and I die. 20Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one; oh, let me escape thither—is it not a little one?—and my soul shall live.’ 21And he said unto him: ‘See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow the city of which thou hast spoken. 22Hasten thou, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither.’—Therefore the name of the city was called aZoar.— 23The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot came unto Zoar. 24Then the LORD caused to rain upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven; 25and He overthrow those cities, and all the Plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground. 26But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt. 27And Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the LORD. 28And he looked out toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all
<br>
<br>a That is, Little, see verse 20.
<br> 
<br>the land of the Plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace.
<br>29And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the Plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when He overthrew the cities in which Lot dwelt.
<br>30And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar; and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters. 31And the first-born said unto the younger: ‘Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth. 32Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.’ 33And they made their father drink wine that night. And the first-born went in, and lay with her father; and he knew not when she lay down, nor when she arose. 34And it came to pass on the morrow, that the first-born said unto the younger: ‘Behold, I lay yesternight with my father. Let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.’ 35And they made their father drink wine that night also. And the younger arose, and lay with him; and he knew not when she lay down, nor when she arose. 36Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father. 37And the first-born bore a son, and called his name Moab—the same
<br> 
<br>is the father of the Moabites unto this day. 38And the younger, she also bore a son, and called his name Ben- ammi—the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.
<br>And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the land of the
<br>South, and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur; and he sojourned in Gerar. 2And Abraham said of Sarah his wife: ‘She is my sister.’ And Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah. 3But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him: ‘Behold, thou shalt die, because of the woman whom thou hast taken; for she is a man’s wife.’ 4Now Abimelech had not come near her; and he said: ‘Lord, wilt Thou slay even a righteous nation? 5Said he not himself unto me: She is my sister? and she, even she herself said: He is my brother. In the simplicity of my heart and the innocency of my hands have I done this.’ 6And God said unto him in the dream: ‘Yea, I know that in the simplicity of thy heart thou hast done this, and I also withheld thee from sinning against Me. Therefore suffered I thee not to touch her. 7Now therefore restore the man’s wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live; and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.’ 8And Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears; and the men were sore afraid. 9Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said
<br> 
<br>unto him: ‘What hast thou done unto us? and wherein have I sinned against thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.’ 10And Abimelech said unto Abraham: ‘What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?’ 11And Abraham said: ‘Because I thought: Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife’s sake. 12And moreover she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and so she became my wife. 13And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father’s house, that I said unto her: This is thy kindness which thou shalt show unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me: He is my brother.’ 14And Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and men-servants and women- servants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife. 15And Abimelech said: ‘Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee.’ 16And unto Sarah he said: ‘Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver; behold, it is for thee a covering of the eyes to all that are with thee; and before all men thou art righted.’ 17And Abraham prayed unto God; and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maid-servants; and they bore children. 18For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham’s wife.
<br> 
<br>And the LORD remembered Sarah as He had said, and the
<br>LORD did unto Sarah as He had spoken. 2And Sarah conceived, and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him. 3And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac. 4And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him. 5And Abraham was a hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him. 6And Sarah said: ‘God hath made laughter for me; every one that heareth will laugh on account of me.’ 7And she said: ‘Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should give children suck? for I have borne him a son in his old age.’
<br>8And the child grew, and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned. 9And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne unto Abraham, making sport. 10Wherefore she said unto Abraham: ‘Cast out this bondwoman and her son; for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.’ 11And the thing was very grievous in Abraham’s sight on account of his son. 12And God said unto Abraham: ‘Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah saith unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall seed be called to thee. 13And also of the son of the
<br> 
<br>bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.’ 14And Abraham arose up early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away; and she departed, and strayed in the wilderness of Beer-sheba. 15And the water in the bottle was spent, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs. 16And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bow- shot; for she said: ‘Let me not look upon the death of the child.’ And she sat over against him, and lifted up her voice, and wept. 17And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her: ‘What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is. 18Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him fast by thy hand; for I will make him a great nation.’ 19And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink. 20And God was with the lad, and he grew; and he dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer. 21And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran; and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.
<br>22And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his host spoke unto Abraham, saying: ‘God is with thee in all that thou doest. 23Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal
<br> 
<br>falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son’s son; but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.’ 24And Abraham said: ‘I will swear.’ 25And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of the well of water, which Abimelech’s servants had violently taken away. 26And Abimelech said: ‘I know not who hath done this thing; neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to-day.’ 27And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and they two made a covenant. 28And Abraham set seven ewe-lambs of the flock by themselves. 29And Abimelech said unto Abraham: ‘What mean these seven ewe-lambs which thou hast set by themselves?’ 30And he said: ‘Verily, these seven ewe-lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that it may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.’ 31Wherefore that place was called Beer-sheba; because there they swore both of them. 32So they made a covenant at Beer-sheba; and Abimelech rose up, and Phicol the captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines. 33And Abraham planted a tamarisk-tree in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the Everlasting God. 34And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days.
<br>And it came to pass after these things, that God   did   prove Abraham,	and	said	unto	him:
<br> 
<br>‘Abraham’; and he said: ‘Here am I.’ 2And He said: ‘Take now thy son, thine only son, whom thou lovest, even Isaac, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.’ 3And Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son; and he cleaved the wood for the burnt-offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him. 4On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off. 5And Abraham said unto his young men: ‘Abide ye here with the ass, and I and the lad will go yonder; and we will worship, and come back to you.’ 6And Abraham took the wood of the burnt-offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took in his hand the fire and the knife; and they went both of them together. 7And Isaac spoke unto Abraham his father, and said: ‘My father.’ And he said: ‘Here am I, my son.’ And he said: ‘Behold the fire and the wood; but where is the lamb for a burnt-offering?’ 8And Abraham said: ‘God will aprovide Himself the lamb for a burnt-offering, my son.’ So they went both of them together. 9And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, upon the
<br>
<br>a Heb jireh, that is, see for Himself.
<br> 
<br>wood. 10And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son. 11And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said: ‘Abraham, Abraham.’ And he said: ‘Here am I.’ 12And he said: ‘Lay not thy hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him; for now I know that thou art a God-fearing man, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from Me.’ 13And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in the thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt-offering in the stead of his son. 14And Abraham called the name of that place aAdonai-jireh; as it is said to this day: ‘In the mount where the LORD is seen.’ 15And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham a second time out of heaven, 16and said: ‘By Myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, 17that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the seashore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies; 18and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast hearkened to My voice.’ 19So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer-
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>a That is, The LORD seeth.
<br> 
<br>sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer- sheba.
<br>20And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying: ‘Behold, Milcah, she also hath borne children unto thy brother Nahor: 21Uz his first-born, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram; 22and Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.’ 23And Bethuel begot Rebekah; these eight did Milcah bear to Nahor, Abraham’s brother. 24And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she also bore Tebah, and Gaham, and Tahash, and Maacah.
<br>חיי שרה
<br>And the life of Sarah was a hundred and seven and twenty
<br>years; these were the years of the life of Sarah. 2And Sarah died in Kiriatharba—the same is Hebron—in the land of Canaan; and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her. 3And Abraham rose up from before his dead, and spoke unto the children of Heth, saying: 4’I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a burying-place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.’ 5And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him: 6’Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us; in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.’ 7And Abraham rose up, and bowed down to the people of the land, even to
<br> 
<br>the children of Heth. 8And he spoke with them, saying: ‘If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar, 9that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for the full price let him give it to me in the midst of you for a possession of a burying-place.’ 10Now Ephron was sitting in the midst of the children of Heth; and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the children of Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying: 11’Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee; bury thy dead.’ 12And Abraham bowed down before the people of the land. 13And he spoke unto Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, saying: ‘But if thou wilt, I pray thee, hear me: I will give the price of the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.’ 14And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him: 15’My lord, hearken unto me: a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.’ 16And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the hearing of the children of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant. 17So the field of Ephron, which was in
<br> 
<br>Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the border thereof round about, were made sure18unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city. 19And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre—the same is Hebron—in the land of Canaan. 20And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a burying-place by the children of Heth.
<br>And Abraham was old, well stricken in age; and the LORD
<br>had blessed Abraham in all things. 2And Abraham said unto his servant, the elder of his house, that ruled over all that he had: ‘Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh. 3And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell. 4But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son, even for Isaac.’ 5And the servant said unto him: ‘Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land; must I needs bring thy son back unto the land from whence thou camest?’ 6And Abraham said unto him: ‘Beware thou that thou bring not my son back thither. 7The LORD, the God of heaven, who took me from my
<br> 
<br>father’s house, and from the land of my nativity, and who spoke unto me, and who swore unto me, saying: Unto thy seed will I give this land; He will send His angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife for my son from thence. 8And if the woman be not willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath; only thou shalt not bring my son back thither.’ 9And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning this matter. 10And the servant took ten camels, of the camels of his master, and departed; having all goodly things of his master’s in his hand; and he arose, and went to aAram-naharaim, unto the city of Nahor. 11And he made the camels to kneel down without the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time that women go out to draw water. 12And he said: ‘O LORD, the God of my master Abraham, send me, I pray Thee, good speed this day, and show kindness unto my master Abraham. 13Behold, I stand by the fountain of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water. 14So let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say: Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say: Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also; let the same be she that Thou hast appointed for Thy servant, even for Isaac; and thereby shall I know that Thou hast
<br>
<br>a That is, Mesopotamia.
<br> 
<br>shown kindness unto my master.’ 15And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder. 16And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her; and she went down to the fountain, and filled her pitcher, and came up. 17And the servant ran to meet her, and said: ‘Give me to drink, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher.’ 18And she said: ‘Drink, my lord’; and she hastened, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink. 19And when she had done giving him drink, she said: ‘I will draw for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.’ 20And she hastened, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw, and drew for all his camels. 21And the man looked stedfastly on her; holding his peace, to know whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not. 22And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden ring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold; 23and said: ‘Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee. Is there room in thy father’s house for us to lodge in?’ 24And she said unto him: ‘I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore unto Nahor.’ 25She said moreover unto him: ‘We have both straw and provender

<br>enough, and room to lodge in.’ 26And the man bowed his head, and prostrated himself before the LORD. 27And he said: ‘Blessed be the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who hath not forsaken His mercy and His truth toward my master; as for me, the LORD hath led me in the way to the house of my master’s brethren.’ 28And the damsel ran, and told her mother’s house according to these words. 29And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban; and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the fountain. 30And it came to pass, when he saw the ring, and the bracelets upon his sister’s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying: ‘Thus spoke the man unto me, ‘that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the fountain. 31And he said: ‘Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore standest thou without? for I have cleared the house, and made room for the camels.’ 32And the man came into the house, and he ungirded the camels; and he gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men that were with him. 33And there was set food before him to eat; but he said: ‘I will not eat, until I have told mine errand.’ And he said: ‘Speak on.’ 34And he said: ‘I am Abraham’s servant. 35And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great; and He hath given him flocks and herds, and silver and gold, and men-servants and maid- servants, and camels and asses. 36And
<br> 
<br>Sarah my master’s wife bore a son to my master when she was old; and unto him hath he given all that he hath. 37And my master made me swear, saying: Thou shalt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell. 38But thou shalt go unto my father’s house, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son. 39And I said unto my master: Peradventure the woman will not follow me. 40And he said unto me: The LORD, before whom I walk, will send His angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father’s house; 41then shalt thou be clear from my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give her not to thee, thou shalt be clear from my oath. 42And I came this day unto the fountain, and said: O LORD, the God of my master Abraham, if now Thou do prosper my way which I go: 43behold, I stand by the fountain of water; and let it come to pass, that the maiden that cometh forth to draw, to whom I shall say: Give me, I pray thee, a little water from thy pitcher to drink; 44and she shall say to me: Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels; let the same be the woman whom the LORD hath appointed for my master’s son. 45And before I had done speaking to my heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the fountain, and drew. And I said unto her: Let me drink, I pray thee. 46And she made
<br> 
<br>haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said: Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also. So I drank, and she made the camels drink also. 47And I asked her, and said: Whose daughter art thou? And she said: The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bore unto him. And I put the ring upon her nose, and the bracelets upon her hands. 48And I bowed my head, and prostrated myself before the LORD, and blessed the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take my master’s brother’s daughter for his son. 49And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me; and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.’ 50Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said: ‘The thing proceedeth from the LORD; we cannot speak unto thee bad or good. 51Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master’s son’s wife, as the LORD hath spoken.’ 52And it came to pass, that, when Abraham’s servant heard their words, he bowed himself down to the earth unto the LORD. 53And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah; he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things. 54And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said: ‘Send me away unto my master.’ 55And her brother and her mother said: ‘Let the
<br> 
<br>damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.’ 56And he said unto them: ‘Delay me not, seeing the LORD hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.’ 57And they said: ‘We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth.’ 58And they called Rebekah, and said unto her: ‘Wilt thou go with this man?’ And she said: ‘I will go.’ 59And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham’s servant, and his men. 60And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her: ‘Our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of ten thousands, and let thy seed possess the gate of those that hate them.’ 61And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man. And the servant took Rebekah, and went his way. 62And Isaac came from the way of Beer-lahai-roi; for he dwelt in the land of the South. 63And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide; and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, there were camels coming. 64And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she alighted from the camel. 65And she said unto the servant: ‘What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us?’ And the servant said: ‘It is my master.’ And she took her veil, and covered herself. 66And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done. 67And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife;
<br> 
<br>and he loved her. And Isaac was comforted for his mother.
<br>And Abraham took another wife,	and	her	name	was Keturah. 2And she bore him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah. 3And Jokshan begot Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of	Dedan		were	Asshurim,		and Letushim, and Leummim. 4And the sons of Midian: Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah. 5And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac. 6But unto the sons of the concubines,			that		Abraham	had, Abraham gave gifts; and he sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country. 7And these are the days of the years of Abraham’s life which he lived, a hundred threescore and fifteen years. 8And Abraham expired, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people. 9And Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre; 10the field which Abraham purchased of the children of Heth; there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife. 11And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed Isaac his son; and Isaac dwelt by Beer-lahai-roi. 12Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s handmaid, bore unto Abraham. 13And these are the
<br> 
<br>names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the first-born of Ishmael, Nebaioth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam, 14and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa; 15Hadad, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedem; 16these are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages, and by their encampments; twelve princes according to their nations. 17And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, a hundred and thirty and seven years; and he expired and died; and was gathered unto his people. 18And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Asshur: over against all his brethren he did settle.
<br>תולדת
<br>19And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son: Abraham begot Isaac. 20And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean, of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Aramean, to be his wife. 21And Isaac entreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren; and the LORD let Himself be entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived. 22And the children struggled together within her; and she said: ‘If it be so, wherefore do I live?’ And she went to inquire of the LORD. 23And the LORD said unto her:
<br>Two nations are in thy womb,
<br>And two peoples shall be separated from thy bowels;
<br> 
<br>And the one people shall be stronger than the other people;
<br>And the elder shall serve the younger.
<br>24And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb. 25And the first came forth ruddy, all over like a hairy mantle; and they called his name Esau. 26And after that came forth his brother, and his hand had hold on Esau’s heel; and his name was called aJacob. And Isaac was threescore years old when she bore them. 27And the boys grew; and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents. 28Now Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison; and Rebekah loved Jacob. 29And Jacob sod pottage; and Esau came in from the field, and he was faint. 30And Esau said to Jacob: ‘Let me swallow, I pray thee, some of this red, red pottage; for I am faint.’ Therefore was his name called bEdom. 31And Jacob said: ‘Sell me first thy birth right.’ 32And Esau said: ‘Behold, I am at the point to die; and what profit shall the birthright do to me?’ 33And Jacob said: ‘Swear to me first’; and he swore unto him; and he sold his birthright unto Jacob. 34And Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils; and he did eat and drink, and rose up,
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>a That is, One that takes by the heel, or, supplants.
<br>b That is, Red.
<br> 
<br>and went his way. So Esau despised his birthright.
<br>And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine
<br>that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar. 2And the LORD appeared unto him, and said: ‘Go not down unto Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of. 3Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I swore unto Abraham thy father; 4and I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these lands; and by thy seed shall all the nations of the earth bless themselves; 5because that Abraham hearkened to My voice, and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws.’ 6And Isaac dwelt in Gerar. 7And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said: ‘She is my sister’; for he feared to say: ‘My wife’; ‘lest the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah, because she is fair to look upon.’ 8And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife. 9And Abimelech called Isaac, and said: ‘Behold, of a surety she is thy wife; and how saidst thou: She is my sister?’ And Isaac said unto him: ‘Because I said: Lest I die because of her.’ 10And
<br> 
<br>Abimelech said: ‘What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might easily have lain with thy wife, and thou wouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.’ 11And Abimelech charged all the people, saying: ‘He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.’ 12And Isaac sowed in that land, and found in the same year a hundred-fold; and the LORD blessed him. 13And the man waxed great, and grew more and more until he became very great. 14And he had possessions of flocks, and possessions of herds, and a great household; and the Philistines envied him. 15Now all the wells which his father’s servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth. 16And Abimelech said unto Isaac: ‘Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.’ 17And Isaac departed thence, and encamped in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there. 18And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham; and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them. 19And Isaac’s servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of living water. 20And the herdmen of Gerar strove with Isaac’s herdmen, saying: ‘The water is ours.’ And he called the
<br> 
<br>name of the well aEsek; because they contended with him. 21And they digged another well, and they strove for that also. And he called the name of it bSitnah. 22And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not. And he called the name of it cRehoboth; and he said: ‘For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.’ 23And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba. 24And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said: ‘I am the God of Abraham thy father. Fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for My servant Abraham’s sake.’ 25And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there; and there Isaac’s servants digged a well. 26Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his host. 27And Isaac said unto them: ‘Wherefore are ye come unto me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?’ 28And they said: ‘We saw plainly that the LORD was with thee; and we said: Let there now be an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee; 29that thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace; thou
<br>
<br>a That is, Contention.
<br>b That is, Enmity.
<br>c That is, Room.
<br> 
<br>art now the blessed of the LORD.’ 30And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink. 31And they rose up betimes in the morning, and swore one to another; and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace. 32And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac’s servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him: ‘We have found water.’ 33And he called it Shibah. Therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba unto this day.
<br>34And when Esau was forty years old, he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite. 35And they were a bitterness of spirit unto Isaac and to Rebekah.
<br>And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes
<br>were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his elder son, and said unto him: ‘My son’; and he said unto him: ‘Here am I.’ 2And he said: ‘Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death. 3Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me venison; 4and make me savoury food, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.’ 5And Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it. 6And Rebekah spoke unto Jacob her son, saying: ‘Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying:
<br> 
<br>7Bring me venison, and make me savoury food, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD before my death. 8Now therefore, my son, hearken to my voice according to that which I command thee. 9Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury food for thy father, such as he loveth; 10and thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, so that he may bless thee before his death.’ 11And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother: ‘Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man. 12My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a mocker; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.’ 13And his mother said unto him: ‘Upon me be thy curse, my son; only hearken to my voice, and go fetch me them.’ 14And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother; and his mother made savoury food, such as his father loved. 15And Rebekah took the choicest garments of Esau her elder son, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son. 16And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck. 17And she gave the savoury food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob. 18And he came unto his father, and said: ‘My father’; and he said: ‘Here am I; who art thou, my son?’ 19And Jacob said unto his father: ‘I am Esau thy first- born; I have done according as thou
<br> 
<br>badest me. Arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.’ 20And Isaac said unto his son: ‘How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son?’ And he said: ‘Because the LORD thy God sent me good speed.’ 21And Isaac said unto Jacob: ‘Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.’ 22And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said: ‘The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau.’ 23And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau’s hands; so he blessed him. 24And he said: ‘Art thou my very son Esau?’ And he said: ‘I am.’ 25And he said: ‘Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son’s venison, that my soul may bless thee.’ And he brought it near to him, and he did eat; and he brought him wine, and he drank. 26And his father Isaac said unto him: ‘Come near now, and kiss me, my son.’ 27And he came near, and kissed him. And he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said:
<br>See, the smell of my son
<br>Is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed.
<br>28So God give thee of the dew of heaven,
<br>And of the fat places of the earth, And plenty of corn and wine.
<br>29Let peoples serve thee,
<br>And nations bow down to thee. Be lord over thy brethren,
<br> 
<br>And let thy mother’s sons bow down to thee.
<br>Cursed be every one that curseth thee,
<br>And blessed be every one that blesseth thee.
<br>30And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting. 31And he also made savoury food, and brought it unto his father; and he said unto his father: ‘Let my father arise, and eat of his son’s venison, that thy soul may bless me.’ 32And Isaac his father said unto him: ‘Who art thou?’ And he said: ‘I am thy son, thy first-born, Esau.’ 33And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said: ‘Who then is he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be blessed.’ 34When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with an exceeding great and bitter cry, and said unto his father: ‘Bless me, even me also, O my father.’ 35And he said: ‘Thy brother came with guile, and hath taken away thy blessing.’ 36And he said: ‘Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing.’ And he said: ‘Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?’ 37And Isaac answered and said unto Esau: ‘Behold, I have made him thy lord,
<br> 
<br>and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him; and what then shall I do for thee, my son?’ 38And Esau said unto his father: ‘Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father.’ And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept. 39And Isaac his father answered and said unto him:
<br>Behold, of the fat places of the earth shall be thy dwelling,
<br>And of the dew of heaven from above;
<br>40And by thy sword shalt thou live, And thou shalt serve thy brother;
<br>And it shall come to pass when thou shalt break loose,
<br>That thou shalt shake his yoke from off thy neck.
<br>41And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him. And Esau said in his heart: ‘Let the days of mourning for my father be at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.’ 42And the words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah; and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him: ‘Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill thee. 43Now therefore, my son, hearken to my voice; and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran; 44and tarry with him a few days, until thy brother’s fury turn away; 45until thy brother’s anger turn away from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him; then I will send, and fetch thee
<br> 
<br>from thence; why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?’
<br>46And Rebekah said to Isaac: ‘I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these, of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?’
<br>And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him,
<br>and said unto him: ‘Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan. 2Arise, go to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother’s father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother’s brother. 3And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a congregation of peoples; 4and give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land of thy sojournings, which God gave unto Abraham.’ 5And Isaac sent away Jacob; and he went to Paddan-aram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob’s and Esau’s mother. 6Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan-aram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying: ‘Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan’; 7and that Jacob hearkened to his father and his mother, and was gone to Paddan-aram; 8and Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father;
<br> 
<br>9so Esau went unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives that he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham’s son, the sister of Nebaioth, to be his wife.
<br>ויצא
<br>10And Jacob went out from Beer- sheba, and went toward Haran. 11And he lighted upon the place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took one of the stones of the place, and put it under his head, and lay down in that place to sleep. 12And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven; and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it. 13And, behold, the LORD stood beside him, and said: ‘I am the LORD, the God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac. The land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed. 14And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south. And in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed. 15And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee whithersoever thou goest, and will bring thee back into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.’ 16And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said: ‘Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew it not.’ 17And he was afraid, and said: ‘How full of awe is this place! this is none other than the house of God, and this is
<br> 
<br>the gate of heaven.’ 18And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put under his head, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it. 19And he called the name of that place aBeth-el, but the name of the city was Luz at the first. 20And Jacob vowed a vow, saying: ‘If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, 21so that I come back to my father’s house in peace, then shall the LORD be my God, 22and this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be God’s house; and of all that Thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto Thee.’
<br>Then Jacob went on his journey, and came to the land
<br>of the children of the east. 2And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, three flocks of sheep lying there by it.—For out of that well they watered the flocks. And the stone upon the well’s mouth was great. 3And thither were all the flocks gathered; and they rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone back upon the well’s mouth in its place.— 4And Jacob said unto them: ‘My brethren, whence are ye?’ And they said: ‘Of Haran are we.’ 5And he said unto them: ‘Know ye Laban the son of Nahor?’ And they said: ‘We know him.’ 6And he said unto them: ‘Is it well with him?’ And
<br>
<br>a That is, The house of God.
<br> 
<br>they said: ‘It is well; and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.’ 7And he said: ‘Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together; water ye the sheep, and go and feed them.’ 8And they said: ‘We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and they roll the stone from the well’s mouth; then we water the sheep.’ 9While he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep; for she tended them. 10And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother’s brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother’s brother. 11And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept. 12And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s brother, and that he was Rebekah’s son; and she ran and told her father. 13And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister’s son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things. 14And Laban said to him: ‘Surely thou art my bone and my flesh.’ And he abode with him the space of a month. 15And Laban said unto Jacob: ‘Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy wages be?’ 16Now Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and
<br> 
<br>the name of the younger was Rachel. 17And Leah’s eyes were weak; but Rachel was of beautiful form and fair to look upon. 18And Jacob loved Rachel; and he said: ‘I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.’ 19And Laban said: ‘It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man; abide with me.’ 20And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her. 21And Jacob said unto Laban: ‘Give me my wife, for my days are filled, that I may go in unto her.’ 22And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast. 23And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her. 24And Laban gave Zilpah his handmaid unto his daughter Leah for a handmaid. 25And it came to pass in the morning that, behold, it was Leah; and he said to Laban: ‘What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?’ 26And Laban said: ‘It is not so done in our place, to give the younger before the first-born. 27Fulfil the week of this one, and we will give thee the other also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.’ 28And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week; and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife. 29And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her handmaid. 30And he went in also unto
<br> 
<br>Rachel, and he loved Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.
<br>31And the LORD saw that Leah was hated, and he opened her womb; but Rachel was barren. 32And Leah conceived, and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben; for she said: ‘Because the LORD ahath looked upon my affliction; for now my husband will love me.’ 33And she conceived again, and bore a son; and said: ‘Because the LORD bhath heard that I am hated, He hath therefore given me this son also.’ And she called his name cSimeon. 34And she conceived again, and bore a son; and said: ‘Now this time will my husband be djoined unto me, because I have borne him three sons.’ Therefore was his name called Levi. 35And she conceived again, and bore a son; and she said: ‘This time will I epraise the LORD.’ Therefore she called his name fJudah; and she left off bearing.
<br>And when Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, Rachel
<br>envied her sister; and she said unto Jacob: ‘Give me children, or else I die.’ 2And Jacob’s anger was kindled against Rachel; and he said: ‘Am I in God’s stead, who hath withheld from

<br> 
<br>thee the fruit of the womb?’ 3And she said: ‘Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; that she may bear upon my knees, and I also may be builded up through her.’ 4And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife; and Jacob went in unto her. 5And Bilhah conceived, and bore Jacob a son. 6And Rachel said: ‘God hath gjudged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son.’ Therefore called she his name Dan. 7And Bilhah Rachel’s handmaid conceived again, and bore Jacob a second son. 8And Rachel said: ‘With mighty wrestlings have I hwrestled with my sister, and have prevailed.’ And she called his name Naphtali. 9When Leah saw that she had left off bearing, she took Zilpah her handmaid, and gave her to Jacob to wife. 10And Zilpah Leah’s handmaid bore Jacob a son. 11And Leah said: ‘Fortune is come! ’ And she called his name iGad. 12And Zilpah Leah’s handmaid bore Jacob a second son. 13And Leah said: ‘Happy am I! for the daughters will call me happy.’ And she called his name jAsher. 14And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah: ‘Give me, I pray thee, of thy son’s mandrakes.’ 15And she said unto her: ‘Is it a small

<br> 
<br>matter that thou hast taken away my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son’s mandrakes also?’ And Rachel said: ‘Therefore he shall lie with thee to-night for thy son’s mandrakes.’ 16And Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said: ‘Thou must come in unto me; for I have surely hired thee with my son’s mandrakes.’ And he lay with her that night. 17And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bore Jacob a fifth son. 18And Leah said: ‘God hath given me my ahire, because I gave my handmaid to my husband. And she called his name Issachar. 19And Leah conceived again, and bore a sixth son to Jacob. 20And Leah said: ‘God hath endowed me with a good dowry; now will my husband bdwell with me, because I have borne him six sons.’ And she called his name Zebulun. 21And afterwards she bore a daughter, and called her name Dinah. 22And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb. 23And she conceived, and bore a son, and said: ‘God chath taken away my reproach.’ 24And she called his
<br>name Joseph, saying: ‘The LORD dadd to me another son.’
<br>25And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said unto

<br> 
<br>Laban: ‘Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country. 26Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served thee, and let me go; for thou knowest my service wherewith I have served thee.’ 27And Laban said unto him: ‘If now I have found favour in thine eyes—I have observed the signs, and the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake.’ 28And he said: ‘Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.’ 29And he said unto him: ‘Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle have fared with me. 30For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it hath increased abundantly; and the LORD hath blessed thee whithersoever I turned. And now when shall I provide for mine own house also?’ 31And he said: ‘What shall I give thee?’ And Jacob said: ‘Thou shalt not give me aught; if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed thy flock and keep it. 32I will pass through all thy flock to- day, removing from thence every speckled and spotted one, and every dark one among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats; and of such shall be my hire. 33So shall my righteousness witness against me hereafter, when thou shalt come to look over my hire that is before thee: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and dark among the sheep, that if found with me shall be counted stolen.’ 34And Laban said: ‘Behold, would it might be according to thy word.’ 35And he
<br> 
<br>removed that day the he-goats that were streaked and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the dark ones among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons. 36And he set three days’journey betwixt himself and Jacob. And Jacob fed the rest of Laban’s flocks. 37And Jacob took him rods of fresh poplar, and of the almond and of the plane- tree; and peeled white streaks in them, making the white appear which was in the rods. 38And he set the rods which he had peeled over against the flocks in the gutters in the watering-troughs where the flocks came to drink; and they conceived when they came to drink. 39And the flocks conceived at the sight of the rods, and the flocks brought forth streaked, speckled, and spotted. 40And Jacob separated the lambs—he also set the faces of the flocks toward the streaked and all the dark in the flock of Laban— and put his own droves apart, and put them not unto Laban’s flock. 41And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger of the flock did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods; 42but when the flock were feeble, he put them not in; so the feebler were Laban’s, and the stronger Jacob’s. 43And the man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, and maid-servants and men-servants, and camels and asses.
<br>31 And he heard the words of
<br> 
<br>Laban’s sons, saying: ‘Jacob hath taken away all that was our father’s; and of that which was our father’s hath he gotten all this wealth.’ 2And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as beforetime. 3And the LORD said unto Jacob: ‘Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.’ 4And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock, 5and said unto them: ‘I see your father’s countenance, that it is not toward me as beforetime; but the God of my father hath been with me. 6And ye know that with all my power I have served your father. 7And your father hath mocked me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me. 8If he said thus: The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the flock bore speckled; and if he said thus: The streaked shall be thy wages; then bore all the flock streaked. 9Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me. 10And it came to pass at the time that the flock conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the he-goats which leaped upon the flock were streaked, speckled, and grizzled. 11And the angel of God said unto me in the dream: Jacob; and I said: Here am I. 12And he said: Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the he-goats which leap upon the flock are streaked, speckled, and grizzled; for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee. 13I am the God of
<br> 
<br>Beth-el, where thou didst anoint a pillar, where thou didst vow a vow unto Me. Now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy nativity.’ 14And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him: ‘Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father’s house? 15Are we not accounted by him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath also quite devoured our price. 16For all the riches which God hath taken away from our father, that is ours and our children’s. Now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.’ 17Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon the camels; 18and he carried away all his cattle, and all his substance which he had gathered, the cattle of his getting, which he had gathered in Paddan- aram, to go to Isaac his father unto the land of Canaan. 19Now Laban was gone to shear his sheep. And Rachel stole the teraphim that were her father’s. 20And Jacob outwitted Laban the Aramean, in that he told him not that he fled. 21So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over athe River, and set his face toward the mountain of Gilead.
<br>22And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled. 23And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days’journey; and he overtook him in the mountain of Gilead. 24And God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream of the night, and
<br>
<br>a That is the Euphrates.
<br> 
<br>said unto him: ‘Take heed to thyself that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.’ 25And Laban came up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain; and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mountain of Gilead. 26And Laban said to Jacob: ‘What hast thou done, that thou hast outwitted me, and carried away my daughters as though captives of the sword? 27Wherefore didst thou flee secretly, and outwit me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth and with songs, with tabret and with harp; 28and didst not suffer me to kiss my sons and my daughters? now hast thou done foolishly. 29It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt; but the God of your father spoke unto me yesternight, saying: Take heed to thyself that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad. 30And now that thou art surely gone, because thou sore longest after thy father’s house, wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?’ 31And Jacob answered and said to Laban: ‘Because I was afraid; for I said: Lest thou shouldest take thy daughters from me by force. 32With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, he shall not live; before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee.’— For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.— 33And Laban went into Jacob’s tent, and into Leah’s tent, and into the tent of the two maid-servants; but he found them not. And he went out of Leah’s tent, and entered into
<br> 
<br>Rachel’s tent. 34Now Rachel had taken the teraphim, and put them in the saddle of the camel, and sat upon them. And Laban felt about all the tent, but found them not. 35And she said to her father: ‘Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise up before thee; for the manner of women is upon me.’ And he searched, but found not the teraphim. 36And Jacob was wroth, and strove with Laban. And Jacob answered and said to Laban: ‘What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast hotly pursued after me? 37Whereas thou hast felt about all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? Set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us two. 38These twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she-goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flocks have I not eaten. 39That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bore the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night. 40Thus I was: in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled from mine eyes. 41These twenty years have I been in thy house: I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy flock; and thou hast changed my wages ten times. 42Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the Fear of Isaac, had been on my side, surely now hadst thou sent me away empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the
<br> 
<br>labour of my hands, and gave judgment yesternight.’ 43And Laban answered and said unto Jacob: ‘The daughters are my daughters, and the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks, and all that thou seest is mine; and what can I do this day for these my daughters, or for their children whom they have borne? 44And now come, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.’ 45And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar. 46And Jacob said unto his brethren: ‘Gather stones’; and they took stones, and made a heap. And they did eat there by the heap. 47And Laban called it aJegar-sahadutha; but Jacob called it bGaleed. 48And Laban said: ‘This heap is witness between me and thee this day.’ Therefore was the name of it called Galeed; 49and cMizpah, for he said: ‘The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another. 50If thou shalt afflict my daughters, and if thou shalt take wives beside my daughters, no man being with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee.’ 51And Laban said to Jacob: ‘Behold this heap, and behold the pillar, which I have set up betwixt me and thee. 52This heap be witness, and the pillar be witness, that
<br>
<br>a That is, The heap of witness in Aramaic.
<br>b That is, The heap of witness in Hebrew.
<br>c That is, The watch-post.
<br> 
<br>I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm. 53The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us.’ And Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac. 54And Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his brethren to eat bread; and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mountain.
<br>And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his
<br>sons and his daughters, and blessed them. And Laban departed, and returned unto his place. 2And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him. 3And Jacob said when he saw them: ‘This is God’s camp.’ And he called the name of that place
<br>aMahanaim.
<br>וישלח
<br>4And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the field of Edom. 5And he commanded them, saying: ‘Thus shall ye say unto my lord Esau: Thus saith thy servant Jacob: I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now. 6And I have oxen, and asses and flocks, and men-servants and maid- servants; and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favour in thy sight.’ 7And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying: ‘We came to thy brother Esau, and moreover he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men
<br>
<br>a That is, Two Camps.
<br> 
<br>with him.’ 8Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed. And he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two camps. 9And he said: ‘If Esau come to the one camp, and smite it, then the camp which is left shall escape.’ 10And Jacob said: ‘O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O LORD, who saidst unto me: Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will do thee good; 11I am not worthy of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which Thou hast shown unto Thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two camps. 12Deliver me, I pray Thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him, lest he come and smite me, the mother with the children. 13And Thou saidst: I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ 14And he lodged there that night; and took of that which he had with him a present for Esau his brother: 15two hundred she-goats and twenty he- goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams, 16thirty milch camels and their colts, forty kine and ten bulls, twenty she-asses and ten foals. 17And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself; and said unto his servants: ‘Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.’ 18And he commanded the foremost, saying:
<br> 
<br>‘When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying: Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee? 19then thou shalt say: They are thy servant Jacob’s; it is a present sent unto my lord, even unto Esau; and, behold, he also is behind us.’ 20And he commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying: ‘In this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him; 21and ye shall say: Moreover, behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us.’ For he said: ‘I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept me.’ 22So the present passed over before him; and he himself lodged that night in the camp.
<br>23And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and his eleven children, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok. 24And he took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had. 25And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day. 26And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh was strained, as he wrestled with him. 27And he said: ‘Let me go, for the day breaketh.’ And he said: ‘I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.’ 28And he said unto him: ‘What is thy name?’ And be said: ‘Jacob.’ 29And he
<br> 
<br>said: ‘Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but aIsrael; for thou hast striven with God and with men, and hast prevailed.’ 30And Jacob asked him, and said: ‘Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.’ And he said: ‘Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name?’ And he blessed him there. 31And Jacob called the name of the place bPeniel: ‘for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.’ 32And the sun rose upon him as he passed over cPeniel, and he limped upon his thigh. 33Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sinew of the thigh-vein which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day; because he touched the hollow of Jacob’s thigh, even in the sinew of the thigh-vein.
<br>
<br>And Jacob lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, Esau
<br>came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids. 2And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost. 3And he himself passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother. 4And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him; and they wept. 5And he lifted up
<br>
<br>a That is, He who striveth with God.
<br>b That is, The face of God.
<br>c Heb. Penuel.
<br> 
<br>his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said: ‘Who are these with thee?’ And he said: ‘The children whom God hath graciously given thy servant.’ 6Then the handmaids came near, they and their children, and they bowed down. 7And Leah also and her children came near, and bowed down; and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed down. 8And he said: ‘What meanest thou by all this camp which I met?’ And he said: ‘To find favour in the sight of my lord.’ 9And Esau said: ‘I have enough; my brother, let that which thou hast be thine.’ 10And Jacob said: ‘Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found favour in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand; forasmuch as I have seen thy face, as one seeth the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me. 11Take, I pray thee, my gift that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough.’ And he urged him, and he took it. 12And he said: ‘Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.’ 13And he said unto him: ‘My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and that the flocks and herds giving suck are a care to me; and if they overdrive them one day, all the flocks will die. 14Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant; and I will journey on gently, according to the pace of the cattle that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.’ 15And Esau said: ‘Let me
<br> 
<br>now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me.’ And he said: ‘What needeth it? let me find favour in the sight of my lord.’ 16So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir. 17And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him a house, and made booths for his cattle. Therefore the name of the place is called aSuccoth.
<br>18And Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan-aram; and encamped before the city. 19And he bought the parcel of ground, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for a hundred pieces of money. 20And he erected there an altar, and called it bEl-elohe-Israel.
<br>And Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she had borne
<br>unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land. 2And Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her; and he took her, and lay with her, and humbled her. 3And his soul did cleave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spoke comfortingly unto the damsel. 4And Shechem spoke unto his father Hamor, saying: ‘Get me this damsel to wife.’ 5Now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter; and his sons were with his cattle in the field; and Jacob held his peace until they came. 6And Hamor the father of
<br>
<br>a That is, Booths.
<br>b That is, God, the God of Israel.
<br> 
<br>Shechem went out unto Jacob to speak with him. 7And the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it; and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought a vile deed in Israel in lying with Jacob’s daughter; which thing ought not to be done. 8And Hamor spoke with them, saying ‘The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter. I pray you give her unto him to wife. 9And make ye marriages with us; give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you. 10And ye shall dwell with us; and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.’ 11And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren: ‘Let me find favour in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give. 12Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me; but give me the damsel to wife.’ 13And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father with guile, and spoke, because he had defiled Dinah their sister, 14and said unto them: ‘We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us. 15Only on this condition will we consent unto you: if ye will be as we are, that every male of you be circumcised; 16then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people. 17But if ye will not
<br> 
<br>hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.’ 18And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor’s son. 19And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob’s daughter. And he was honoured above all the house of his father. 20And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and spoke with the men of their city, saying: 21’These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for, behold, the land is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters. 22Only on this condition will the men consent unto us to dwell with us, to become one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised. 23Shall not their cattle and their substance and all their beasts be ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us.’ 24And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city. 25And it came to pass on the third day, when they were in pain, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city unawares, and slew all the males. 26And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem’s house, and went forth.
<br> 
<br>27The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister. 28They took their flocks and their herds and their asses, and that which was in the city and that which was in the field; 29and all their wealth, and all their little ones and their wives, took they captive and spoiled, even all that was in the house. 30And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi: ‘Ye have troubled me, to make me odious unto the inhabitants of the land, even unto the Canaanites and the Perizzites; and, I being few in number, they will gather themselves together against me and smite me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.’ 31And they said: ‘Should one deal with our sister as with a harlot?’
<br>And God said unto Jacob: ‘Arise, go up to Beth-el, and
<br>dwell there; and make there an altar unto God, who appeared unto thee when thou didst flee from the face of Esau thy brother.’ 2Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him: ‘Put away the strange gods that are among you, and purify yourselves, and change your garments; 3and let us arise, and go up to Beth-el; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.’ 4And they gave unto Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hand, and the rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the terebinth which was by Shechem. 5And they journeyed; and a
<br> 
<br>terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob. 6So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan—the same is Beth-el— he and all the people that were with him. 7And he built there an altar, and called the place aEl-beth-el, because there God was revealed unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother. 8And Deborah Rebekah’s nurse died, and she was buried below Beth-el under the oak; and the name of it was called bAllon-bacuth.
<br>9And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came from Paddan- aram, and blessed him. 10And God said unto him: ‘Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name’; and He called his name Israel. 11And God said unto him: ‘I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins; 12and the land which I gave unto Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.’ 13And God went up from him in the place where He spoke with him. 14And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where He spoke with him, a pillar of stone, and he poured out a drink-offering thereon, and poured oil thereon. 15And Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with
<br>
<br>a That is, The God of Beth-el.
<br>b That is, The oak of weeping.
<br> 
<br>him, Beth-el. 16And they journeyed from Beth-el; and there was still some way to come to Ephrath; and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour. 17And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the mid-wife said unto her: ‘Fear not; for this also is a son for thee.’ 18And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing—for she died—that she called his name aBen- oni; but his father called him bBenjamin. 19And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath—the same is Beth-lehem. 20And Jacob set up a pillar upon her grave; the same is the pillar of Rachel’s grave unto this day. 21And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond Migdal-eder. 22And it came to pass, while Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father’s concubine; and Israel heard of it.
<br>Now the sons of Jacob were twelve: 23the sons of Leah: Reuben, Jacob’s first-born, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun; 24the sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin; 25and the sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s handmaid: Dan and Naphtali; 26and the sons of Zilpah, Leah’s handmaid: Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob, that were born to him in Paddan-aram. 27And Jacob came unto Isaac his father to Mamre, to Kiriatharba—the same is Hebron— where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.
<br>
<br>a That is, The son of my sorrow.
<br>b That is, The son of the right hand.
<br> 
<br>28And the days of Isaac were a hundred and fourscore years. 29And Isaac expired, and died, and was gathered unto his people, old and full of days; and Esau and Jacob his sons buried him.
<br>Now these are the generations of Esau—the same is Edom.
<br>2Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite, 3and Basemath Ishmael’s daughter, sister of Nebaioth. 4And Adah bore to Esau Eliphaz; and Basemath bore Reuel; 5and Oholibamah bore Jeush, and Jalam, and Korah. These are the sons of Esau, that were born unto him in the land of Canaan. 6And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the souls of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his possessions, which he had gathered in the land of Canaan; and went into a land away from his brother Jacob. 7For their substance was too great for them to dwell together; and the land of their sojournings could not bear them because of their cattle. 8And Esau dwelt in the mountain-land of Seir— Esau is Edom. 9And these are the generations of Esau the father of a cthe Edomites in the mountain-land of Seir. 10These are the names of Esau’s sons: Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Basemath the
<br>
<br>c Heb. Edom.
<br> 
<br>wife of Esau. 11And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz. 12And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau’s son; and she bore to Eliphaz Amalek. These are the sons of Adah Esau’s wife. 13And these are the sons of Reuel: Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These were the sons of Basemath Esau’s wife. 14And these were the sons of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon, Esau’s wife; and she bore to Esau Jeush, and Jalam, and Korah. 15These are the chiefs of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the first-born of Esau: the chief of Teman, the chief of Omar, the chief of Zepho, the chief of Kenaz, 16the chief of Korah, the chief of Gatam, the chief of Amalek. These are the chiefs that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom. These are the sons of Adah. 17And these are the sons of Reuel Esau’s son: the chief of Nahath, the chief of Zerah, the chief of Shammah, the chief of Mizzah. These are the chiefs that came of Reuel in the land of Edom. These are the sons of Basemath Esau’s wife. 18And these are the sons of Oholibamah Esau’s wife: the chief of Jeush, the chief of Jalam, the chief of Korah. These are the chiefs that came of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau’s wife. 19These are the sons of Esau, and these are their chiefs; the same is Edom.
<br>20These are the sons of Seir the Horite, the inhabitants of the land: Lotan and Shobal and Zibeon and
<br> 
<br>Anah, 21and Dishon and Ezer and Dishan. These are the chiefs that came of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom. 22And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan’s sister was Timna. 23And these are the children of Shobal: Alvan and Manahath and Ebal, Shepho and Onam. 24And these are the children of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah—this is Anah who found the hot springs in the wilderness, as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father. 25And these are the children of Anah: Dishon and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah. 26And these are the children of aDishon: Hemdan and Eshban and Ithran and Cheran. 27These are the children of Ezer: Bilhan and Zaavan and Akan. 28These are the children of Dishan: Uz and Aran. 29These are the chiefs that came of the Horites: the chief of Lotan, the chief of Shobal, the chief of Zibeon, the chief of Anah, 30the chief of Dishon, the chief of Ezer, the chief of Dishan. These are the chiefs that came of the Horites, according to their chiefs in the land of Seir.
<br>31And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of Israel. 32And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom; and the name of his city was Dinhabah. 33And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead. 34And
<br>
<br>a Heb. Dishan.
<br> 
<br>Jobab died, and Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned in his stead. 35And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead; and the name of his city was Avith. 36And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead. 37And Samlah died, and Shaul of Rehoboth by the River reigned in his stead. 38And Shaul died, and Baal-hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead. 39And Baal-hanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead; and the name of the city was Pau; and his wife’s name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Me-zahab. 40And these are the names of the chiefs that came of Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names: the chief of Timna, the chief of Alvah, the chief of Jetheth; 41the chief of Oholibamah, the chief of Elah, the chief of Pinon; 42the chief of Kenaz, the chief of Teman, the chief of Mibzar; 43the chief of Magdiel, the chief of Iram. These are the chiefs of Edom, according to their habitations in the land of their possession. This is Esau the father of the Edomites.
<br>וישב
<br>And Jacob dwelt in the land of his father’s sojournings, in the
<br>land of Canaan. 2These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren, being still a lad even with the sons of Bilhah, and
<br> 
<br>with the sons of Zilpah, his father’s wives; and Joseph brought evil report of them unto their father. 3Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age; and he made him a coat of many colours. 4And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him. 5And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brethren; and they hated him yet the more. 6And he said unto them: ‘Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed: 7for, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves came round about, and bowed down to my sheaf.’ 8And his brethren said to him: ‘Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us?’ And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words. 9And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brethren, and said: ‘Behold, I have dreamed yet a dream: and, behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to me.’ 10And he told it to his father, and to his brethren; and his father rebuked him, and said unto him: ‘What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down to thee to the earth?’ 11And his brethren envied him; but his father kept the saying in mind.
<br> 
<br>12And his brethren went to feed their father’s flock in Shechem. 13And Israel said unto Joseph: ‘Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them.’ And he said to him: ‘Here am I.’ 14And he said to him: ‘Go now, see whether it is well with thy brethren, and well with the flock; and bring me back word.’ So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem. 15And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field. And the man asked him, saying: ‘What seekest thou?’ 16And he said: ‘I seek my brethren. Tell me, I pray thee, where they are feeding the flock.’ 17And the man said: ‘They are departed hence; for I heard them say: Let us go to Dothan.’ And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan. 18And they saw him afar off, and before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him. 19And they said one to another: ‘Behold, this dreamer cometh. 20Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into one of the pits, and we will say: An evil beast hath devoured him; and we shall see what will become of his dreams.’ 21And Reuben heard it, and delivered him out of their hand; and said: ‘Let us not take his life.’ 22And Reuben said unto them: ‘Shed no blood; cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, but lay no hand upon him’—that he might deliver him out of their hand, to restore him to his father. 23And it came to pass, when
<br> 
<br>Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stripped Joseph of his coat, the coat of many colours that was on him; 24and they took him, and cast him into the pit—and the pit was empty, there was no water in it. 25And they sat down to eat bread; and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a caravan of Ishmaelites came from Gilead, with their camels bearing spicery and balm and ladanum, going to carry it down to Egypt. 26And Judah said unto his brethren: ‘What profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood? 27Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother, our flesh.’ And his brethren hearkened unto him. 28And there passed by Midianites, merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty shekels of silver. And they brought Joseph into Egypt. 29And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes. 30And he returned unto his brethren, and said: ‘The child is not; and as for me, whither shall I go?’ 31And they took Joseph’s coat, and killed a he-goat, and dipped the coat in the blood; 32and they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their father; and said: ‘This have we found. Know now whether it is thy son’s coat or not.’ 33And he knew it, and said: ‘It is my son’s coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt torn in pieces.’  34And
<br> 
<br>Jacob rent his garments, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days. 35And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said: ‘Nay, but I will go down to the grave to my son mourning.’ And his father wept for him. 36And the aMidianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s, the captain of the guard.
<br>And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down
<br>from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah. 2And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua; and he took her, and went in unto her. 3And she conceived, and bore a son; and he called his name Er. 4And she conceived again, and bore a son; and she called his name Onan. 5And she yet again bore a son, and called his name Shelah; and he was at Chezib, when she bore him. 6And Judah took a wife for Er his first- born, and her name was Tamar. 7And Er, Judah’s first-born, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him. 8And Judah said unto Onan: ‘Go in unto thy brother’s wife, and perform the duty of a husband’s brother unto her, and raise up seed to thy brother.’ 9And Onan knew that the seed would not be his; and it came to pass when he went in unto his brother’s wife, that he spilled it on the
<br>
<br>a Heb. Medanites.
<br> 
<br>ground, lest he should give seed to his brother. 10And the thing which he did was evil in the sight of the LORD; and He slew him also. 11Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter-in-law: ‘Remain a widow in thy father’s house, till Shelah my son be grown up’; for he said: ‘Lest he also die, like his brethren.’ And Tamar went and dwelt in her father’s house. 12And in process of time Shua’s daughter, the wife of Judah, died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheep-shearers to Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite. 13And it was told Tamar, saying: ‘Behold, thy father-in-law goeth up to Timnah to shear his sheep.’ 14And she put off from her the garments of her widowhood, and covered herself with her veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in the entrance of Enaim, which is by the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she was not given unto him to wife. 15When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a harlot; for she had covered her face. 16And he turned unto her by the way, and said: ‘Come, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee’; for he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said: ‘What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?’ 17And he said: ‘I will send thee a kid of the goats from the flock.’ And she said: ‘Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?’ 18And he said: ‘What pledge shall I give thee?’ And she said: ‘Thy signet and thy cord, and thy staff that
<br> 
<br>is in thy hand.’ And he gave them to her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him. 19And she arose, and went away, and put off her veil from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood. 20And Judah sent the kid of the goats by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman’s hand; but he found her not. 21Then he asked the men of her place, saying: ‘Where is the harlot, that was at Enaim by the wayside?’ And they said: ‘There hath been no harlot here.’ 22And he returned to Judah, and said: ‘I have not found her; and also the men of the place said: There hath been no harlot here.’ 23And Judah said: ‘Let her take it, lest we be put to shame; behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.’ 24And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying: ‘Tamar thy daughter-in-law hath played the harlot; and moreover, behold, she is with child by harlotry.’ And Judah said: ‘Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.’ 25When she was brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying: ‘By the man, whose these are, am I with child’; and she said: ‘Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and the cords, and the staff.’ 26And Judah acknowledged them, and said: ‘She is more righteous than I; forasmuch as I gave her not to Shelah my son.’ And he knew her again no more. 27And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb. 28And it came to pass,
<br> 
<br>when she travailed, that one put out a hand; and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying: ‘This came out first.’ 29And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold his brother came out; and she said: ‘Wherefore hast thou made a breach for thyself?’ Therefore his name was called aPerez. 30And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand; and his name was called Zerah.
<br>And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an
<br>officer of Pharaoh’s, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hand of the Ishmaelites, that had brought him down thither. 2And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian. 3And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand. 4And Joseph found favour in his sight, and he ministered unto him. And he appointed him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand. 5And it came to pass from the time that he appointed him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had, in the house and in the field. 6And he left all that he had in Joseph’s hand; and, having him, he knew not aught save
<br>
<br>a That is, A breach.
<br> 
<br>the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was of beautiful form, and fair to look upon.
<br>7And it came to pass after these things, that his master’s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said: ‘Lie with me.’ 8But he refused, and said unto his master’s wife: ‘Behold, my master, having me, knoweth not what is in the house, and he hath put all that he hath into my hand; 9he is not greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?’ 10And it came to pass, as she spoke to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her. 11And it came to pass on a certain day, when he went into the house to do his work, and there was none of the men of the house there within, 12that she caught him by his garment, saying: ‘Lie with me.’ And he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out. 13And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth, 14that she called unto the men of her house, and spoke unto them, saying: ‘See, he hath brought in a Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice. 15And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and fled, and got him out.’ 16And she laid up his garment by her, until his master came home. 17And
<br> 
<br>she spoke unto him according to these words, saying: ‘The Hebrew servant, whom thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me. 18And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and fled out.’ 19And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke unto him, saying: ‘After this manner did thy servant to me’; that his wrath was kindled. 20And Joseph’s master took him, and put him into the prison, the place where the king’s prisoners were bound; and he was there in the prison. 21But the LORD was with Joseph, and showed kindness unto him, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison. 22And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph’s hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it. 23The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand, because the LORD was with him; and that which he did, the LORD made it to prosper.
<br>And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the
<br>king of Egypt and his baker offended their lord the king of Egypt. 2And Pharaoh was wroth against his two officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers. 3And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound. 4And the captain of the guard charged Joseph to be with them,
<br> 
<br>and he ministered unto them; and they continued a season in ward. 5And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream, in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were bound in the prison. 6And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and saw them, and, behold, they were sad. 7And he asked Pharaoh’s officers that were with him in the ward of his master’s house, saying: ‘Wherefore look ye so sad to- day?’ 8And they said unto him: ‘We have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it.’ And Joseph said unto them: ‘Do not interpretations belong to God? tell it me, I pray you.’ 9And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him: ‘In my dream, behold, a vine was before me; 10and in the vine were three branches; and as it was budding, its blossoms shot forth, and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes, 11and Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand.’ 12And Joseph said unto him: ‘This is the interpretation of it: the three branches are three days; 13within yet three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head, and restore thee unto thine office; and thou shalt give Pharaoh’s cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler. 14But have me in thy remembrance when it shall be well with thee, and show kindness, I pray thee, unto me,
<br> 
<br>and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house. 15For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews; and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.’ 16When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph: ‘I also saw in my dream, and, behold, three baskets of white bread were on my head; 17and in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of baked food for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.’ 18And Joseph answered and said: ‘This is the interpretation thereof: the three baskets are three days; 19within yet three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.’ 20And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants; and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and the head of the chief baker among his servants. 21And he restored the chief butler back unto his butlership; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand. 22But he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them. 23Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgot him.
<br>מקץ
<br>And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh
<br> 
<br>dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the ariver. 2And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, well-favoured and fat-fleshed; and they fed in the reed-grass. 3And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and lean-fleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river. 4And the ill- favoured and lean-fleshed kine did eat up the seven well-favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke. 5And he slept and dreamed a second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good. 6And, behold, seven ears, thin and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them. 7And the thin ears swallowed up the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream. 8And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof; and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh. 9Then spoke the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying: ‘I make mention of my faults this day: 10Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in the ward of the house of the captain of the guard, me and the chief baker. 11And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream. 12And there was with us there a
<br>
<br>a That is, the Nile.
<br> 
<br>young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret. 13And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was: I was restored unto mine office, and he was hanged.’ 14Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon. And he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh. 15And Pharaoh said unto Joseph: ‘I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it; and I have heard say of thee, that when thou hearest a dream thou canst interpret it.’ 16And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying: ‘It is not in me; God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace.’ 17And Pharaoh spoke unto Joseph: ‘In my dream, behold, I stood upon the brink of the river. 18And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fat- fleshed and well-favoured; and they fed in the reedgrass. 19And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill-favoured and lean- fleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness. 20And the lean and ill-favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine. 21And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill-favoured as at the beginning. So I awoke. 22And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up upon one stalk, full and good. 23And, behold, seven ears, withered,
<br> 
<br>thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them. 24And the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears. And I told it unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.’ 25And Joseph said unto Pharaoh: ‘The dream of Pharaoh is one; what God is about to do He hath declared unto Pharaoh. 26The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one. 27And the seven lean and ill-favoured kine that came up after them are seven years, and also the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind; they shall be seven years of famine. 28That is the thing which I spoke unto Pharaoh: what God is about to do He hath shown unto Pharaoh. 29Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt. 30And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land; 31and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine which followeth; for it shall be very grievous. 32And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice, it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass. 33Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt. 34Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint overseers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of  Egypt in  the seven  years  of
<br> 
<br>plenty. 35And let them gather all the food of these good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it. 36And the food shall be for a store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.’ 37And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants. 38And Pharaoh said unto his servants: ‘Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom the spirit of God is?’ 39And Pharaoh said unto Joseph: ‘Forasmuch as God hath shown thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou. 40Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled; only in the throne will I be greater than thou.’ 41And Pharaoh said unto Joseph: ‘See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.’ 42And Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph’s hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck. 43And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him: ‘Abrech’; and he set him over all the land of Egypt. 44And Pharaoh said unto Joseph: ‘I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt.’ 45And Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphenath- paneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On. And Joseph went out
<br> 
<br>over the land of Egypt.— 46And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt.—And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt. 47And in the seven years of plenty the earth brought forth in heaps. 48And he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities; the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same. 49And Joseph laid up corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until they left off numbering; for it was without number. 50And unto Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came, whom Asenath the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On bore unto him. 51And Joseph called the name of the first-born aManasseh: ‘for God hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father’s house.’ 52And the name of the second called he bEphraim: ‘for God hath made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.’ 53And the seven years of plenty, that was in the land of Egypt, came to an end. 54And the seven years of famine began to come, according as Joseph had said; and there was famine in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread. 55And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread; and Pharaoh said
<br>
<br>a That is, Making to forget.
<br>b From a Hebrew word signifying to be fruitful,
<br> 
<br>unto all the Egyptians: ‘Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.’ 56And the famine was over all the face of the earth; and Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine was sore in the land of Egypt. 57And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph to buy corn; because the famine was sore in all the earth.
<br>Now Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, and Jacob said
<br>unto his sons: ‘Why do ye look one upon another?’ 2And he said: ‘Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt. Get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.’ 3And Joseph’s ten brethren went down to buy corn from Egypt. 4But Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said: ‘Lest peradventure harm befall him.’ 5And the sons of Israel came to buy among those that came; for the famine was in the land of Caanan. 6And Joseph was the governor over the land; he it was that sold to all the people of the land. And Joseph’s brethren came, and bowed down to him with their faces to the earth. 7And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spoke roughly with them; and he said unto them: ‘Whence come ye?’ And they said: ‘From the land of Canaan to buy food.’ 8And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew him not. 9And Joseph remembered   the   dreams   which   he
<br> 
<br>dreamed of them, and said unto them: ‘Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.’ 10And they said unto him: ‘Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come. 11We are all one man’s sons; we are upright men, thy servants are no spies.’ 12And he said unto them: ‘Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.’ 13And they said: ‘We thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not.’ 14And Joseph said unto them: ‘That is it that I spoke unto you, saying: Ye are spies. 15Hereby ye shall be proved, as Pharaoh liveth, ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither. 16Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be bound, that your words may be proved, whether there be truth in you; or else, as Pharaoh liveth, surely ye are spies.’ 17And he put them all together into ward three days. 18And Joseph said unto them the third day.’ This do, and live; for I fear God: 19if ye be upright men, let one of your brethren be bound in your prison-house; but go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses; 20and bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die.’ And they did so. 21And they said one to another: ‘We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this
<br> 
<br>distress come upon us.’ 22And Reuben answered them, saying: ‘Spoke I not unto you, saying: Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore also, behold, his blood is required.’ 23And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for the interpreter was between them. 24And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and he returned to them, and spoke to them, and took Simeon from among them, and bound him before their eyes. 25Then Joseph commanded to fill their vessels with corn, and to restore every man’s money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way; and thus was it done unto them. 26And they laded their asses with their corn, and departed thence. 27And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the lodging-place, he espied his money; and, behold, it was in the mouth of his sack. 28And he said unto his brethren: ‘My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack.’ And their heart failed them, and they turned trembling one to another, saying: ‘What is this that God hath done unto us?’ 29And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that had befallen them, saying: 30’The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country. 31And we said unto him: We are upright men; we are no spies. 32We are twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.
<br> 
<br>33And the man, the lord of the land, said unto us: Hereby shall I know that ye are upright men: leave one of your brethren with me, and take corn for the famine of your houses, and go your way. 34And bring your youngest brother unto me; then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are upright men; so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffic in the land.’ 35And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man’s bundle of money was in his sack; and when they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid. 36And Jacob their father said unto them: ‘Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away; upon me are all these things come.’ 37And Reuben spoke unto his father, saying: ‘Thou shalt slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee; deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him back to thee.’ 38And he said: ‘My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he only is left; if harm befall him by the way in which ye go, then will ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.
<br>And the famine was sore in the land. 2And it came to pass,
<br>when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, that their father said unto them: ‘Go again, buy us a little food.’ 3And Judah spoke unto him, saying: ‘The man did earnestly forewarn us, saying: Ye shall
<br> 
<br>not see my face, except your brother be with you. 4If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food; 5but if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down, for the man said unto us: Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.’ 6And Israel said: ‘Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?’ 7And they said: ‘The man asked straitly concerning ourselves, and concerning our kindred, saying: Is your father yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words; could we in any wise know that he would say: Bring your brother down?’ 8And Judah said unto Israel his father: ‘Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go, that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones. 9I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him; if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever. 10For except we had lingered, surely we had now returned a second time.’ 11And their father Israel said unto them: ‘If it be so now, do this: take of the choice fruits of the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spicery and ladanum, nuts, and almonds; 12and take double money in your hand; and the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks carry back in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight; 13take also your brother, and
<br> 
<br>arise, go again unto the man; 14and God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may release unto you your other brother and Benjamin. And as for me, if I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.’
<br>15And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph. 16And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house: ‘Bring the men into the house, and kill the beasts, and prepare the meat; for the men shall dine with me at noon.’ 17And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph’s house. 18And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph’s house; and they said: ‘Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.’ 19And they came near to the steward of Joseph’s house, and they spoke unto him at the door of the house, 20and said: ‘Oh my lord, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food. 21And it came to pass, when we came to the lodging-place, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man’s money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight; and we have brought it back in our hand. 22And other money have we brought down in our hand to buy food. We know not who put our money in our
<br> 
<br>sacks.’ 23And he said: ‘Peace be to you, fear not; your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks; I had your money.’ And he brought Simeon out unto them. 24And the man brought the men into Joseph’s house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender. 25And they made ready the present against Joseph’s coming at noon; for they heard that they should eat bread there. 26And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed down to him to the earth. 27And he asked them of their welfare, and said: ‘Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spoke? Is he yet alive?’ 28And they said: ‘Thy servant our father is well, he is yet alive.’ And they bowed the head, and made obeisance. 29And he lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin his brother, his mother’s son, and said: ‘Is this your youngest brother of whom ye spoke unto me?’ And he said: ‘God be gracious unto thee, my son.’ 30And Joseph made haste; for his heart yearned toward his brother; and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there. 31And he washed his face, and came out; and he refrained himself, and said: ‘Set on bread.’ 32And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, that did eat with him, by themselves; because the Egyptians might not  eat
<br> 
<br>bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians. 33And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth; and the men marvelled one with another. 34And portions were taken unto them from before him; but Benjamin’s portion was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.
<br>And he commanded the steward of his house, saying:
<br>‘Fill the men’s sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man’s money in his sack’s mouth. 2And put my goblet, the silver goblet, in the sack’s mouth of the youngest, and his corn money.’ And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken. 3As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses. 4And when they were gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward: ‘Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them: Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good? 5Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby he indeed divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.’ 6And he overtook them, and he spoke unto them these words. 7And they said unto him: ‘Wherefore speaketh my lord such words as these? Far be it from thy servants that they should do such a thing. 8Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks’mouths, we brought back unto
<br> 
<br>thee out of the land of Canaan; how then should we steal out of thy lord’s house silver or gold? 9With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, let him die, and we also will be my lord’s bondmen.’ 10And he said: ‘Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my bondman; and ye shall be blameless.’ 11Then they hastened, and took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack. 12And he searched, beginning at the eldest, and leaving off at the youngest; and the goblet was found in Benjamin’s sack. 13And they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city. 14And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph’s house, and he was yet there; and they fell before him on the ground. 15And Joseph said unto them: ‘What deed is this that ye have done? know ye not that such a man as I will indeed divine?’ 16And Judah said: ‘What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants; behold, we are my lord’s bondmen, both we, and he also in whose hand the cup is found.’ 17And he said: ‘Far be it from me that I should do so; the man in whose hand the goblet is found, he shall be my bondman; but as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.’
<br> 
<br>ויגש
<br>18Then Judah came near unto him, and said: ‘Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord’s ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant; for thou art even as Pharaoh. 19My lord asked his servants, saying: Have ye a father, or a brother? 20And we said unto my lord: We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him. 21And thou saidst unto thy servants: Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him. 22And we said unto my lord: The lad cannot leave his father; for if he should leave his father, his father would die. 23And thou saidst unto thy servants: Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more. 24And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord. 25And our father said: Go again, buy us a little food. 26And we said: We cannot go down; if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down; for we may not see the man’s face, except our youngest brother be with us. 27And thy servant my father said unto us: Ye know that my wife bore me two sons; 28and the one went out from me, and I said: Surely he is torn in pieces; and I have not seen him since; 29and if ye take this one also from me, and harm befall him, ye will
<br> 
<br>bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave. 30Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad is not with us; seeing that his soul is bound up with the lad’s soul; 31it will come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die; and thy servants will bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave. 32For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying: If I bring him not unto thee, then shall I bear the blame to my father for ever. 33Now therefore, let thy servant, I pray thee, abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren. 34For how shall I go up to my father, if the lad be not with me? lest I look upon the evil that shall come on my father.’
<br>Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that
<br>stood by him; and he cried: ‘Cause every man to go out from me.’ And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren. 2And he wept aloud; and the Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard. 3And Joseph said unto his brethren: ‘I am Joseph; doth my father yet live?’ And his brethren could not answer him; for they were affrighted at his presence. 4And Joseph said unto his brethren: ‘Come near to me, I pray you.’ And they came near. And he said: ‘I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt. 5And now be not grieved, nor angry
<br> 
<br>with yourselves, that ye sold me hither; for God did send me before you to preserve life. 6For these two years hath the famine been in the land; and there are yet five years, in which there shall be neither plowing nor harvest. 7And God sent me before you to give you a remnant on the earth, and to save you alive for a great deliverance. 8So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God; and He hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt. 9Hasten ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him: Thus saith thy son Joseph: God hath made me lord of all Egypt; come down unto me, tarry not. 10And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children’s children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast; 11and there will I sustain thee; for there are yet five years of famine; lest thou come to poverty, thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast. 12And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you. 13And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall hasten and bring down my father hither.’ 14And he fell upon his brother Benjamin’s neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck. 15And he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them; and after that his brethren talked with him.
<br> 
<br>16And the report thereof was heard in Pharaoh’s house, saying: ‘Joseph’s brethren are come’; and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants. 17And Pharaoh said unto Joseph: ‘Say unto thy brethren: This do ye: lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan; 18and take your father and your households, and come unto me; and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land. 19Now thou art commanded, this do ye: take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come. 20Also regard not your stuff; for the good things of all the land of Egypt are yours.’ 21And the sons of Israel did so; and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way. 22To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred shekels of silver, and five changes of raiment. 23And to his father he sent in like manner ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she- asses laden with corn and bread and victual for his father by the way. 24So he sent his brethren away, and they departed; and he said unto them: ‘See that ye fall not out by the way.’ 25And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father. 26And they told him, saying: ‘Joseph is yet alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt.’ And
<br> 
<br>his heart fainted, for he believed them not. 27And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them; and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived. 28And Israel said: ‘It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive; I will go and see him before I die.’
<br>And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came
<br>to Beer-sheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac. 2And God spoke unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said: ‘Jacob, Jacob.’ And he said: ‘Here am I.’ 3And He said: ‘I am God, the God of thy father; fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation. 4I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up again; and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.’ 5And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba; and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him. 6And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him; 7his sons, and his sons’sons with him, his daughters, and his sons’daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.
<br>8And these are the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob’s first-born. 9And the sons of
<br> 
<br>Reuben: Hanoch, and Pallu, and Hezron, and Carmi. 10And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman. 11And the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 12And the sons of Judah: Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Perez, and Zerah; but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul. 13And the sons of Issachar: Tola, and Puvah, and Iob, and Shimron. 14And the sons of Zebulun: Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel. 15These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore unto Jacob in Paddan-aram, with his daughter Dinah; all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three. 16And the sons of Gad: Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli. 17And the sons of Asher: Imnah, and Ishvah, and Ishvi, and Beriah, and Serah their sister; and the sons of Beriah: Heber, and Malchiel. 18These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter, and these she bore unto Jacob, even sixteen souls. 19The sons of Rachel Jacob’s wife: Joseph and Benjamin. 20And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On bore unto him. 21And the sons of Benjamin: Bela, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard. 22These are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob; all the souls
<br> 
<br>were fourteen. 23And the sons of Dan: Hushim. 24And the sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem. 25These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and these she bore unto Jacob; all the souls were seven. 26All the souls belonging to Jacob that came into Egypt, that came out of his loins, besides Jacob’s sons’wives, all the souls were threescore and six. 27And the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt, were two souls; all the souls of the house of Jacob, that came into Egypt, were threescore and ten.
<br>28And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to show the way before him unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen. 29And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen; and he presented himself unto him, and fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while. 30And Israel said unto Joseph: ‘Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, that thou art yet alive.’ 31And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father’s house: ‘I will go up, and tell Pharaoh, and will say unto him: My brethren, and my father’s house, who were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me; 32and the men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have. 33And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say: What is your occupation? 34that ye shall say: Thy servants have been
<br> 
<br>keepers of cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and our fathers; that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians.’
<br>Then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, and said: ‘My father
<br>and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen.’ 2And from among his brethren he took five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh. 3And Pharaoh said unto his brethren: ‘What is your occupation?’ And they said unto Pharaoh: ‘Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and our fathers.’ 4And they said unto Pharaoh: ‘To sojourn in the land are we come; for there is no pasture for thy servants’flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan. Now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.’ 5And Pharaoh spoke unto Joseph, saying: ‘Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee; 6the land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and thy brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell. And if thou knowest any able men among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.’ 7And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh. And Jacob blessed Pharaoh. 8And Pharaoh said unto Jacob: ‘How many are the days of the years of thy life?’ 9And Jacob  said unto Pharaoh: ‘The
<br> 
<br>days of the years of my sojournings are a hundred and thirty years; few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their sojournings.’ 10And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of Pharaoh. 11And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded. 12And Joseph sustained his father, and his brethren, and all his father’s household, with bread, according to the want of their little ones.
<br>13And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished by reason of the famine. 14And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought; and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s house. 15And when the money was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said: ‘Give us bread; for why should we die in thy presence? for our money faileth.’ 16And Joseph said: ‘Give your cattle, and I will give you [bread] for your cattle, if money fail.’ 17And they brought their cattle unto Joseph. And Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses, and for the flocks, and
<br> 
<br>for the herds, and for the asses; and he fed them with bread in exchange for all their cattle for that year. 18And when that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him: ‘We will not hide from my lord, how that our money is all spent; and the herds of cattle are my lord’s; there is nought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands. 19Wherefore should we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be bondmen unto Pharaoh; and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the land be not desolate.’ 20So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine was sore upon them; and the land became Pharaoh’s. 21And as for the people, he removed them city by city, from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end thereof. 22Only the land of the priests bought he not, for the priests had a portion from Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them; wherefore they sold not their land. 23Then Joseph said unto the people: ‘Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh. Lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land. 24And it shall come to pass at the ingatherings, that ye shall give a fifth unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little
<br> 
<br>ones.’ 25And they said: ‘Thou hast saved our lives. Let us find favour in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh’s bondmen.’ 26And Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt unto this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth; only the land of the priests alone became not Pharaoh’s. 27And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they got them possessions therein, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly.
<br>ויחי
<br>28And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years; so the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were a hundred forty and seven years. 29And the time drew near that Israel must die; and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him: ‘If now I have found favour in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt. 30But when I sleep with my fathers, thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying- place.’ And he said: ‘I will do as thou hast said.’ 31And he said: ‘Swear unto me.’ And he swore unto him. And Israel bowed down upon the bed’s head.
<br>And it came to pass after these things, that one said to Joseph: ‘Behold, thy father is sick.’ And he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. 2And one told Jacob, and said: ‘Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee.’ And Israel strengthened
<br> 
<br>himself, and sat upon the bed. 3And Jacob said unto Joseph: ‘God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me, 4and said unto me: Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a company of peoples; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession. 5And now thy two sons, who were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon, shall be mine. 6And thy issue, that thou begettest after them, shall be thine; they shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance. 7And as for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died unto me in the land of Canaan in the way, when there was still some way to come unto Ephrath; and I buried her there in the way to Ephrath—the same is Beth- lehem.’ 8And Israel beheld Joseph’s sons, and said: ‘Who are these?’ 9And Joseph said unto his father: ‘They are my sons, whom God hath given me here.’ And he said: ‘Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.’ 10Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them. 11And Israel said unto Joseph: ‘I had not thought to see thy face; and, lo, God hath let me see thy seed also.’ 12And Joseph brought them out from between his knees; and he fell down
<br> 
<br>on his face to the earth. 13And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel’s right hand, and brought them near unto him. 14And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim’s head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh’s head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the first-born. 15And he blessed Joseph, and said: ‘The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God who hath been my shepherd all my life long unto this day, 16the angel who hath redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named in them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.’ 17And when Joseph saw that his father was laying his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him, and he held up his father’s hand, to remove it from Ephraim’s head unto Manasseh’s head. 18And Joseph said unto his father: ‘Not so, my father, for this is the first-born; put thy right hand upon his head.’ 19And his father refused, and said: ‘I know it, my son, I know it; he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great; howbeit his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.’ 20And he blessed them that day, saying: ‘By thee shall Israel bless, saying: God make thee as Ephraim and as
<br> 
<br>Manasseh.’ And he set Ephraim before Manasseh. 21And Israel said unto Joseph: ‘Behold, I die; but God will be with you, and bring you back unto the land of your fathers. 22Moreover I have given to thee one aportion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.’

<br>And Jacob called unto his sons,	and	said:	‘Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the end
<br>of days.
<br>2Assemble yourselves, and hear, ye sons of Jacob;
<br>And hearken unto Israel your father.
<br>3Reuben, thou art my first-born,
<br>My might, and the first-fruits of my strength;
<br>The excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power.
<br>4Unstable as water, have not thou the excellency;
<br>Because thou wentest up to thy father’s bed;
<br>Then defiledst thou it—he went up to my couch.
<br>
<br>5Simeon and Levi are brethren; Weapons of violence their kinship. 6Let my soul not come into their
<br>council;
<br>Unto their assembly let my glory not be not united;
<br>For in their anger they slew men,
<br>
<br>a Heb. schechem, shoulder.
<br> 
<br>And in their self-will they houghed oxen.
<br>7Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce,
<br>And their wrath, for it was cruel; I will divide them in Jacob,
<br>And scatter them in Israel
<br>
<br>8Judah, thee shall thy brethren praise;
<br>Thy hand shall be on the neck of thine enemies;
<br>Thy father’s sons shall bow down before thee.
<br>9Judah is a lion’s whelp;
<br>From the prey, my son, thou art gone up.
<br>He stooped down, he couched as a lion,
<br>And as a lioness; who shall rouse him up?
<br>10The sceptre shall not depart from Judah,
<br>Nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet,
<br>As long as men come to Shiloh;
<br>And unto him shall the obedience of the peoples be.
<br>11Binding his foal unto the vine,
<br>And his ass’s colt unto the choice vine;
<br>He washeth his garments in wine,
<br>And his vesture in the blood of grapes;
<br>12His eyes shall be red with wine, And his teeth white with milk.
<br>
<br>13Zebulun shall dwell at the shore of the sea,
<br> 
<br>And he shall be a shore for ships, And his flank shall be upon Zidon.
<br>
<br>14Issachar is a large-boned ass, Couching down between the sheep-
<br>folds.
<br>15For he saw a resting-place that it was good,
<br>And the land that it was pleasant; And he bowed his shoulder to bear, And became a servant under task-
<br>work
<br>
<br>16Dan shall judge his people, As one of the tribes of Israel.
<br>17Dan shall be a serpent in the way, A horned snake in the path,
<br>That biteth the horse’s heels,
<br>So that his rider falleth backward.
<br>18I wait for Thy salvation, O Lord.
<br>
<br>19Gad, aa troop bshall troop upon him;
<br>But he shall troop upon their heel.
<br>
<br>20As for Asher, his bread shall be fat,
<br>And he shall yield royal dainties.
<br>
<br>21Naphtali is a hind let loose: He giveth goodly words.

<br>23The archers have dealt bitterly with him,
<br>And shot at him, and hated him;
<br>24But his bow abode firm,
<br>And the arms of his hands were made supple,
<br>By the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob,
<br>From thence, from the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel,
<br>25Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee,
<br>And by the Almighty, who shall bless thee,
<br>With blessings of heaven above,
<br>Blessings of the deep that coucheth beneath,
<br>Blessings of the breasts, and of the womb.
<br>26The blessings of thy father
<br>Are mighty beyond the blessings of my progenitors
<br>Unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills;
<br>They shall be on the head of Joseph,
<br>And on the crown of the head of the prince among his brethren.
<br>
<br>27Benjamin is a wolf that raveneth;
<br>In the morning he devoureth the prey,
<br>And at even he divideth the spoil.’
<br>
<br>28All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is it that their father spoke unto them and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them. 29And be charged them, and said unto them: ‘I am to be
<br> 
<br>gathered unto my people; bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite, 30in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a burying-place. 31There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah. 32The field and the cave that is therein, which was purchased from the children of Heth.’ 33And when Jacob made an end of charging his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and expired, and was gathered unto his people.
<br>And Joseph fell upon his father’s face, and wept upon
<br>him, and kissed him. 2And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father. And the physicians embalmed Israel. 3And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of embalming. And the Egyptians wept for him threescore and ten days.
<br>4And when the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spoke unto the house of Pharaoh, saying: ‘If now I have found favour in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying: 5My father made me swear, saying: Lo, I die; in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come back.’
<br> 
<br>6And Pharaoh said: ‘Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.’ 7And Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt, 8and all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father’s house; only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen. 9And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen; and it was a very great company. 10And they came to the threshing-floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, and there they wailed with a very great and sore wailing; and he made a mourning for his father seven days. 11And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said: ‘This is a grievous amourning to the Egyptians.’ Wherefore the name of it was called Abel-mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan. 12And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them. 13For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field, for a possession of a burying-place, of Ephron the Hittite, in front of Mamre.
<br>14And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father. 15And when Joseph’s brethren saw that their father
<br>
<br>a Heb. ebel.
<br> 
<br>was dead, they said: ‘It may be that Joseph will hate us, and will fully requite us all the evil which we did unto him.’ 16And they sent a message unto Joseph, saying: ‘Thy father did command before he died, saying: 17So shall ye say unto Joseph: Forgive, I pray thee now, the transgression of thy brethren, and their sin, for that they did unto thee evil. And now, we pray thee, forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of thy father.’ And Joseph wept when they spoke unto him. 18And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said: ‘Behold, we are thy bondmen.’ 19And Joseph said unto them: ‘Fear not; for am I in the place of God? 20And as for you, ye meant evil against me; but God meant it for good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive. 21Now therefore fear ye not; I will sustain you, and your little ones.’ And he comforted them, and spoke kindly unto them.
<br>22And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father’s house; and Joseph lived a hundred and ten years. 23And Joseph saw Ephraim’s children of the third generation; the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were born upon Joseph’s knees. 24And Joseph said unto his brethren: ‘I die; but God will surely remember you, and bring you up out of this land unto the land which He swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.’ 25And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying: ‘God will surely remember you, and
<br> 
<br>ye shall carry up my bones from hence.’ 26So Joseph died, being a hundred and ten years old. And they
<br> 
<br>embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.
<br> 
<br>שמות
<br>EXODUS
<br> 
<br>NOW THESE are the names of the sons of Israel, who   came   into Egypt with Jacob; every man came with his household: 2Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah; 3Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin; 4Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher. 5And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls; and Joseph was in Egypt already. 6And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation. 7And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied,	and	waxed	exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with
<br>them.
<br>
<br>8Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph. 9And he said unto his people: ‘Behold, the people of the children of Israel are too many and too mighty for us; 10come, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there befalleth us any war, they also join themselves unto our enemies, and fight against us, and get them up out of the land.’ 11Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh store-cities, Pithom and Raamses. 12But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and  the more they  spread
<br> 
<br>abroad. And they were adread because of the children of Israel. 13And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour. 14And they made their lives bitter with hard service, in mortar and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field; in all their service, wherein they made them serve with rigour.
<br>15And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah; 16and he said: ‘When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, ye shall look upon the birthstool: if it be a son, then ye shall kill him; but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.’ 17But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men-children alive. 18And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them: ‘Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men-children alive?’ 19And the midwives said unto Pharaoh: ‘Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwife come unto them.’ 20And God dealt well with the midwives; and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty. 21And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that He
<br> 
<br>made them houses. 22And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying: ‘Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.’
<br>And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi. 2And the woman conceived, and bore a son; and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months. 3And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch; and she put the child therein, and laid it in the flags by the river’s brink. 4And his sister stood afar off, to know what would be done to him. 5And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe in the river; and her maidens walked along by the river- side; and she saw the ark among the flags, and sent her handmaid to fetch it. 6And she opened it, and saw it, even the child; and behold a boy that wept. And she had compassion on him, and said:	‘This	is		one		of	the Hebrews’children.’	7Then	said	his sister to Pharaoh’s daughter: ‘Shall I go and call thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?’ 8And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her: ‘Go.’ And the maiden went and called the child’s mother. 9And Pharaoh’s daughter said unto her: ‘Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages.’ And the woman took the child, and nursed it. 10And the child grew, and
<br> 
<br>she brought him unto Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name aMoses, and said: ‘Because I bdrew him out of the water.’
<br>11And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown up, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens; and he saw an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren. 12And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he smote the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand. 13And he went out the second day, and, behold, two men of the Hebrews were striving together; and he said to him that did the wrong: ‘Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?’ 14And he said: ‘Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us? thinkest thou to kill me, as thou didst kill the Egyptian?’ And Moses feared, and said: ‘Surely the thing is known.’ 15Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian; and he sat down by a well. 16Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters; and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock. 17And the shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock. 18And when they came to Reuel their father, he said: ‘How is it that ye are
<br>
<br>a Heb. Mosheh.
<br>b Heb. mashah, to draw out.
<br> 
<br>come so soon to-day?’ 19And they said: ‘An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew water for us, and watered the flock.’ 20And he said unto his daughters: ‘And where is he? Why is it that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.’ 21And Moses was content to dwell with the man; and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter. 22And she bore a son, and he called his name Gershom; for he said: ‘I have been aa stranger in a strange land.’
<br>
<br>23And it came to pass in the course of those many days that the king of Egypt died; and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage. 24And God heard their groaning, and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. 25And God saw the children of Israel, and God took cognizance of them.
<br>Now Moses was keeping the flock of Jethro his father-in-law,
<br>the priest of Midian; and he led the flock to the farthest end of the wilderness, and came to the mountain of God, unto Horeb. 2And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush; and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed. 3And Moses said: ‘I will
<br>
<br>a Heb. ger.
<br> 
<br>turn aside now, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.’ 4And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said: ‘Moses, Moses.’ And he said: ‘Here am I.’ 5And He said: ‘Draw not nigh hither; put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.’ 6Moreover He said: ‘I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’ And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God. 7And the LORD said: ‘I have surely seen the affliction of My people that are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their pains; 8and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite. 9And now, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto Me; moreover I have seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them. 10Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth My people the children of Israel out of Egypt.’ 11And Moses said unto God: ‘Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?’ 12And He said: ‘Certainly I will be
<br> 
<br>with thee; and this shall be the token unto thee, that I have sent thee: when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.’ 13And Moses said unto God: ‘Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them: The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me: What is His name? what shall I say unto them?’ 14And God said unto Moses: ‘I AM THAT I AM’; and He said: ‘Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel: I AM hath sent me unto you.’ 15And God said moreover unto Moses: ‘Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel: The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you; this is My name for ever, and this is My memorial unto all generations. 16Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them: The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, hath appeared unto me, saying: I have surely remembered you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt. 17And I have said: I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, unto a land flowing with milk and honey. 18And they shall hearken to thy voice. And thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him: The LORD, the God
<br> 
<br>of the Hebrews, hath met with us. And now let us go, we pray thee, three days’journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God. 19And I know that the king of Egypt will not give you leave to go, except by a mighty hand. 20And I will put forth My hand, and smite Egypt with all My wonders which I will do in the midst thereof. And after that he will let you go. 21And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians. And it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty; 22but every woman shall ask of her neighbour, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment; and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.’
<br>And Moses answered and said: ‘But, behold, they will not believe
<br>me, nor hearken unto my voice; for they will say: The lord hath not appeared unto thee.’ 2And the LORD said unto him: ‘What is that in thy hand?’ And he said: ‘A rod.’ 3And He said: ‘Cast it on the ground.’ And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it. 4And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘Put forth thy hand, and take it by the tail— and he put forth his hand, and laid hold of it, and it became a rod in his hand— 5that they may believe that the LORD, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto
<br> 
<br>thee.’ 6And the LORD said furthermore unto him: ‘Put now thy hand into thy bosom.’ And he put his hand into his bosom; and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous, as white as snow. 7And He said: ‘Put thy hand back into thy bosom.—And he put his hand back into his bosom; and when he took it out of his bosom, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.— 8And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign. 9And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe even these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land; and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.’ 10And Moses said unto the LORD: ‘Oh Lord, I am not a man of words, neither heretofore, nor since Thou hast spoken unto Thy servant; for I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.’ 11And the LORD said unto him: ‘Who hath made man’s mouth? or who maketh a man dumb, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? is it not I the LORD? 12Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt speak.’ 13And he said: ‘Oh Lord, send, I pray Thee, by the hand of him whom Thou wilt send.’ 14And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and He said: ‘Is there not Aaron thy brother the Levite? I know that he can speak well. And also,
<br> 
<br>behold, he cometh forth to meet thee; and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart. 15And thou shalt speak unto him, and put the words in his mouth; and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do. 16And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people; and it shall come to pass, that he shall be to thee a mouth, and thou shalt be to him in God’s stead. 17And thou shalt take in thy hand this rod, wherewith thou shalt do the signs.’
<br>18And Moses went and returned to aJethro his father-in-law, and said unto him: ‘Let me go, I pray thee, and unto my brethren that are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive.’ And Jethro said to Moses: ‘Go in peace.’ 19And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian: ‘Go, return into Egypt; for all the men are dead that sought thy life.’ 20And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt; and Moses took the rod of God in his hand. 21And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘When thou goest back into Egypt, see that thou do before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have put in thy hand; but I will harden his heart, and he will not let the people go. 22And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh: Thus saith the LORD: Israel is My son, My first-born. 23And I have said unto thee: Let My son go, that he may serve Me; and thou hast refused to let him go. Behold, I will slay thy
<br>
<br>a Heb. Jether.
<br> 
<br>son, thy first-born.’— 24And it came to pass on the way at the lodging-place, that the LORD met him, and sought to kill him. 25Then Zipporah took a flint, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet; and she said: ‘Surely a bridegroom of blood art thou to me.’ 26So He let him alone. Then she said: ‘A bridegroom of blood in regard of the circumcision.’
<br>27And the LORD said to Aaron: ‘Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.’ And he went, and met him in the mountain of God, and kissed him. 28And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD wherewith He had sent him, and all the signs wherewith He had charged him. 29And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel. 30And Aaron spoke all the words which the LORD had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people. 31And the people believed; and when they heard that the LORD had remembered the children of Israel, and that He had seen their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.
<br>And afterward Moses and Aaron came, and   said   unto   Pharaoh: ‘Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: Let My people go, that they may hold a feast unto Me in the wilderness.’ 2And Pharaoh said: ‘Who is the LORD, that I should hearken unto His voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, and moreover I will not let Israel go.’ 3And they said: ‘The God of
<br> 
<br>the Hebrews hath met with us. Let us go, we pray thee, three days’journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice unto the LORD our God; lest He fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.’ 4And the king of Egypt said unto them: ‘Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, cause the people to break loose from their work? get you unto your burdens.’ 5And Pharaoh said: ‘Behold, the people of the land are now many, and will ye make them rest from their burdens?’ 6And the same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying: 7’Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore. Let them go and gather straw for themselves. 8And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish aught thereof; for they are idle; therefore they cry, saying: Let us go and sacrifice to our God. 9Let heavier work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard lying words.’ 10And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying: ‘Thus saith Pharaoh: I will not give you straw. 11Go yourselves, get you straw where ye can find it; for nought of your work shall be diminished.’ 12So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw. 13And the taskmasters were urgent, saying: ‘Fulfil your work, your daily task, as when there was straw.’ 14And the
<br> 
<br>officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, saying: ‘Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your appointed task in making brick both yesterday and today as heretofore?’ 15Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying: ‘Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants? 16There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us: Make brick; and, behold, thy servants are beaten, but the fault is in thine own people.’ 17But he said: ‘Ye are idle, ye are idle; therefore ye say: Let us go and sacrifice to the LORD. 18Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.’ 19And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were set on mischief, when they said: ‘Ye shall not diminish aught from your bricks, your daily task.’ 20And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh; 21and they said unto them: ‘The LORD look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.’ 22And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said: ‘Lord, wherefore hast Thou dealt ill with this people? why is it that Thou hast sent me? 23For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Thy name, he hath dealt ill with this people; neither hast Thou delivered Thy people at all.’
<br> 
<br>And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘Now shalt thou see what I will
<br>do to Pharaoh; for by a strong hand shall he let them go, and by a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land.’
<br>וארא
<br>2And God spoke unto Moses, and said unto him: ‘I am the LORD; 3and I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, as God Almighty, but by My name aיהוה I made Me not
<br>known to them. 4And I have also established My covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their sojournings, wherein they sojourned. 5And moreover I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered My covenant. 6Wherefore say unto the children of Israel: I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will deliver you from their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm, and with great judgments; 7and I will take you to Me for a people, and I will be to you a God; and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God, who brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. 8And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning which I lifted up My hand to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for a heritage: I am the
<br>
<br>a The ineffable name, read Adonai, which means, the Lord.
<br> 
<br>LORD.’ 9And Moses spoke so unto the children of Israel; but they hearkened not unto Moses for impatience of spirit, and for cruel bondage.
<br>10And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 11’Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.’ 12And Moses spoke before the LORD, saying: ‘Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips?’
<br>13And the LORD spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.
<br>14These are the heads of their fathers’houses: the sons of Reuben the first-born of Israel: Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. These are the families of Reuben. 15And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman. These are the families of Simeon. 16And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations: Gershon and Kohath, and Merari. And the years of the life of Levi were a hundred thirty and seven years. 17The sons of Gershon: Libni and Shimei, according to their families. 18And the sons of Kohath: Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel. And the years of the life of Kohath were a hundred thirty and three years. 19And the sons
<br> 
<br>of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their generations. 20And Amram took him Jochebed his father’s sister to wife; and she bore him Aaron and Moses. And the years of the life of Amram were a hundred and thirty and seven years. 21And the sons of Izhar: Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri. 22And the sons of Uzziel: Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Sithri. 23And Aaron took him Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab, the sister of Nahshon, to wife; and she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. 24And the sons of Korah: Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph; these are the families of the Korahites. 25And Eleazar Aaron’s son took him one of the daughters of Putiel to wife; and she bore him Phinehas. These are the heads of the fathers’houses of the Levites according to their families. 26These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said: ‘Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their hosts.’ 27These are they that spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt. These are that Moses and Aaron. 28And it came to pass on the day when the LORD spoke unto Moses in the land of Egypt, 29that the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: ‘I am the LORD; speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I speak unto thee.’ 30And Moses said before the LORD: ‘Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken
<br> 
<br>unto me?’ 1And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘See, I have set thee
<br>in God’s stead to Pharaoh; and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet. 2Thou shalt speak all that I command thee; and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land. 3And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and multiply My signs and My wonders in the land of Egypt. 4But Pharaoh will not hearken unto you, and I will lay My hand upon Egypt, and bring forth My hosts, My people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt, by great judgments. 5And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch forth My hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them.’ 6And Moses and Aaron did so; as the LORD commanded them, so did they. 7And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when they spoke unto Pharaoh.
<br>
<br>8And the LORD spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying: 9’When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying: Show a wonder for you; then thou shalt say unto Aaron: Take thy rod, and cast it down before Pharaoh, that it become a serpent.’ 10And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so, as the LORD had commanded; and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a serpent. 11Then Pharaoh also called for the wise men and the
<br> 
<br>sorcerers; and they also, the magicians of Egypt, did in like manner with their secret arts. 12For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents; but Aaron’s rod swallowed up their rods. 13And Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had spoken.
<br>14And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘Pharaoh’s heart is stubborn, he refuseth to let the people go. 15Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the river’s brink to meet him; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thy hand. 16And thou shalt say unto him: The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, hath sent me unto thee, saying: Let My people go, that they may serve Me in the wilderness; and, behold, hitherto thou hast not hearkened; 17thus saith the LORD: In this thou shalt know that I am the LORD—behold, I will smite with the rod that is in my hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood. 18And the fish that are in the river shall die, and the river shall become foul; and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink water from the river.’
<br>19And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘Say unto Aaron: Take thy rod, and stretch out thy hand over the waters of Egypt, over their rivers, over their streams, and over their pools, and over all their ponds of water, that they may become blood; and there shall be blood throughout all the land of Egypt,
<br> 
<br>both in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone.’ 20And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood. 21And the fish that were in the river died; and the river became foul, and the Egyptians could not drink water from the river; and the blood was throughout all the land of Egypt. 22And the magicians of Egypt did in like manner with their secret arts; and Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had spoken. 23And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he lay even this to heart. 24And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river. 25And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten the river. 26And the LORD spoke unto Moses: ‘Go in unto Pharaoh, and say unto him: Thus saith the LORD: Let My people go, that they may serve Me. 27And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs. 28And the river shall swarm with frogs, which shall go up and come into thy house, and into thy bed-chamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneading-troughs. 29And the frogs shall come up both upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon
<br> 
<br>all thy servants.’ 1And the LORD said	unto	Moses:	‘Say	unto Aaron: Stretch forth thy hand with thy rod over the rivers, over the canals, and over the pools, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.’ 2And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt. 3And the magicians did in like manner with their secret arts, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt. 4Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said: ‘Entreat the LORD, that He take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice unto the LORD.’ 5And Moses said unto Pharaoh: ‘Have thou this glory over me; against what time shall I entreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, that the frogs be destroyed from thee and thy houses, and remain in the river only?’ 6And he said: ‘Against to-morrow.’ And he said: ‘Be it according to thy word; that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the LORD our God. 7And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only.’ 8And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh; and Moses cried unto the LORD concerning the frogs, which He had brought upon Pharaoh. 9And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the courts, and out of the fields.  10And they gathered them
<br> 
<br>together in heaps; and the land stank. 11But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had spoken. 12And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘Say unto Aaron: Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the earth, that it may become gnats throughout all the land of Egypt.’ 13And they did so; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and there were gnats upon man, and upon beast; all the dust of the earth became gnats throughout all the land of Egypt. 14And the magicians did so with their secret arts to bring forth gnats, but they could not; and there were gnats upon man, and upon beast. 15Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh: ‘This is the finger of God’; and Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had spoken.
<br>16And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto him: Thus saith the LORD: Let My people go, that they may serve Me. 17Else, if thou wilt not let My people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses; and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are. 18And I will set apart in that day the land of Goshen, in which My people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the
<br> 
<br>end that thou mayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth. 19And I will put a division between My people and thy people—by to-morrow shall this sign be.’ 20And the LORD did so; and there came grievous swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants’houses; and in all the land of Egypt the land was ruined by reason of the swarms of flies. 21And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said: ‘Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land.’ 22And Moses said: ‘It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God; lo, if we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, will they not stone us? 23We will go three days’journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as He shall command us.’ 24And Pharaoh said: ‘I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away; entreat for me.’ 25And Moses said: ‘Behold, I go out from thee, and I will entreat the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, tomorrow; only let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD.’ 26And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the LORD. 27And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and He removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there  remained
<br> 
<br>not one. 28And Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and he did not let the people go.
<br>
<br>Then the LORD said unto Moses: ‘Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him: Thus saith the LORD, the God of the Hebrews: Let My people go, that they may serve Me. 2For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still, 3behold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which are in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the herds, and upon the flocks; there shall be a very grievous murrain. 4And the LORD shall make a division between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt; and there shall nothing die of all that belongeth to the children of Israel.’ 5And the LORD appointed	a	set	time,	saying: ‘Tomorrow the LORD shall do this thing in the land.’ 6And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt died; but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one. 7And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not so much as one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was stubborn, and he did not
<br>let the people go.
<br>8And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron: ‘Take to you handfuls of soot of the furnace, and let Moses throw it heavenward in the sight of Pharaoh. 9And it shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast,
<br> 
<br>throughout all the land of Egypt.’ 10And they took soot of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses threw it up heavenward; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast. 11And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boils were upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians. 12And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses.
<br>13And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him: Thus saith the LORD, the God of the Hebrews: Let My people go, that they may serve Me. 14For I will this time send all My plagues upon thy person, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that there is none like Me in all the earth. 15Surely now I had put forth My hand, and smitten thee and thy people with pestilence, and thou hadst been cut off from the earth. 16But in very deed for this cause have I made thee to stand, to show thee My power, and that My name may be declared throughout all the earth. 17As yet exaltest thou thyself against My people, that thou wilt not let them go? 18Behold, tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the day it was founded even until now. 19Now therefore send, hasten in thy cattle and all that thou hast in the
<br> 
<br>field; for every man and beast that shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die.’ 20He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses; 21and he that regarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and his cattle in the field.
<br>22And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘Stretch forth thy hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.’ 23And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven; and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and fire ran down unto the earth; and the LORD caused to hail upon the land of Egypt. 24So there was hail, and fire flashing up amidst the hail, very grievous, such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation. 25And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and broke every tree of the field. 26Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was there no hail. 27And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them: ‘I have sinned this time; the LORD is righteous, and I and my people are wicked. 28Entreat the LORD, and let there be enough of these mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer.’ 29And
<br> 
<br>Moses said unto him: ‘As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread forth my hands unto the LORD; the thunders shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know that the earth is the LORD’s. 30But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the LORD God.’— 31And the flax and the barley were smitten; for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was in bloom. 32But the wheat and the spelt were not smitten; for they ripen late.— 33And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread forth his hands unto the LORD; and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth. 34And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants. 35And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the children of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses.
<br>בא
<br>And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘Go in unto Pharaoh;
<br>for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might show these My signs in the midst of them; 2and that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son’s son, what I have wrought upon Egypt, and My signs which I have done among them; that ye may know that I am the LORD.’ 3And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him: ‘Thus
<br> 
<br>saith the LORD, the God of the Hebrews: How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before Me? let My people go, that they may serve Me. 4Else, if thou refuse to let My people go, behold, to-morrow will I bring locusts into thy border; 5and they shall cover the face of the earth, that one shall not be able to see the earth; and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field; 6and thy houses shall be filled, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; as neither thy fathers nor thy fathers’fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day.’ And he turned, and went out from Pharaoh. 7And Pharaoh’s servants said unto him: ‘How long shall this man be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God, knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?’ 8And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh; and he said unto them: ‘Go, serve the LORD your God; but who are they that shall go?’ 9And Moses said: ‘We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds we will go; for we must hold a feast unto the LORD.’ 10And he said unto them: ‘So be the LORD with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones; see ye that evil is before your face. 11Not so; go now ye that are men, and serve the LORD; for
<br> 
<br>that is what ye desire.’ And they were driven out from Pharaoh’s presence.
<br>12And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘Stretch out thy hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left.’ 13And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all the night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts. 14And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the borders of Egypt; very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such. 15For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left; and there remained not any green thing, either tree or herb of the field, through all the land of Egypt. 16Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said: ‘I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you. 17Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and entreat the LORD your God, that He may take away from me this death only.’ 18And he went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the LORD. 19And the LORD turned an exceeding strong west wind, which took up the locusts, and drove them into the Red Sea; there remained not one locust in all the border of Egypt. 20But the LORD
<br> 
<br>hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not let the children of Israel go.
<br>21And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘Stretch out thy hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.’ 22And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days; 23they saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days; but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings. 24And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said: ‘Go ye, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed; let your little ones also go with you.’ 25And Moses said: ‘Thou must also give into our hand sacrifices and burnt-offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God. 26Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not a hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither.’ 27But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not let them go. 28And Pharaoh said unto him: ‘Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in the day thou seest my face thou shalt die.’ 29And Moses said: ‘Thou hast spoken well; I will see thy face again no more.’
<br>
<br>And	the	LORD	said	unto Moses: ‘Yet one plague more
<br>will I bring upon Pharaoh, and upon
<br> 
<br>Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence; when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether. 2Speak now in the ears of the people, and let them ask every man of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold.’ 3And the LORD   gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh’s servants, and in the sight of the people.
<br>4And Moses said: ‘Thus saith the LORD: About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt; 5and all the first-born in the land of Egypt shall die, from the first-born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the first-born of the maid-servant that is behind the mill; and all the first-born of cattle. 6And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there hath been none like it, nor shall be like it any more. 7But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog whet his tongue, against man or beast; that ye may know how that the LORD doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel. 8And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down unto me, saying: Get thee out, and all the people that follow thee; and after that I will go out.’ And he went out from Pharaoh in hot anger.
<br>9And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘Pharaoh will not hearken unto you; that My wonders may be multiplied in
<br> 
<br>the land of Egypt.’ 10And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh; and the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not let the children of Israel go out of his land.
<br>And the LORD spoke unto Moses and Aaron in the land
<br>of Egypt, saying: 2’This month shall be unto you the beginning of months; it shall be the first month of the year to you. 3Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying: In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to their fathers’houses, a lamb for a household; 4and if the household be too little for a lamb, then shall he and his neighbour next unto his house take one according to the number of the souls; according to every man’s eating ye shall make your count for the lamb. 5Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year; ye shall take it from the sheep, or from the goats; 6and ye shall keep it unto the fourteenth day of the same month; and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it at dusk. 7And they shall take of the blood, and put it on the two side-posts and on the lintel, upon the houses wherein they shall eat it. 8And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; with bitter herbs they shall eat it. 9Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with fire; its head with its legs and with the inwards thereof. 10And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; but that which
<br> 
<br>remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire. 11And thus shall ye eat it: with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste—it is the LORD’s passover. 12For I will go through the land of Egypt in that night, and will smite all the first- born in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am the LORD. 13And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are; and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and there shall no plague be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt. 14And this day shall be unto you for a memorial, and ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD; throughout your generations ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever. 15Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; howbeit the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses; for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel. 16And in the first day there shall be to you a holy convocation, and in the seventh day a holy convocation; no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done by you. 17And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought your hosts out of the land of Egypt; therefore shall ye observe this day throughout your generations by an
<br> 
<br>ordinance for ever. 18In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even. 19Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses; for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a sojourner, or one that is born in the land. 20Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread.’
<br>21Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them: ‘Draw out, and take you lambs according to your families, and kill the passover lamb. 22And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two side-posts with the blood that is in the basin; and none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning. 23For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when He seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side-posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you. 24And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever. 25And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the LORD will give you, according as He hath promised, that ye shall keep this service. 26And it shall come to pass, when your children shall
<br> 
<br>say unto you: What mean ye by this service? 27that ye shall say: It is the sacrifice of the LORD’s passover, for that He passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when He smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses.’ And the people bowed the head and worshipped. 28And the children of Israel went and did so; as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.
<br>29And it came to pass at midnight, that the LORD smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the first-born of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the first-born of cattle. 30And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead. 31And he called for Moses and Aaron by night and said: ‘Rise up, get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said. 32Take both your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also.’ 33And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, to send them out of the land in haste; for they said: ‘We are all dead men.’ 34And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading-troughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders. 35And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they asked of the Egyptians jewels of
<br> 
<br>silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment. 36And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let them have what they asked. And they despoiled the Egyptians.
<br>
<br>37And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, beside children. 38And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle. 39And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual. 40Now the time that the children of Israel dwelt in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years. 41And it came to pass at the end of four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the host of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt. 42It was a night of watching unto the LORD for bringing them out from the land of Egypt; this same night is a night of watching unto the LORD for all the children of Israel throughout their generations.
<br>43And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron: ‘This is the ordinance of the passover: there shall no alien eat thereof; 44but every man’s servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof. 45A sojourner and a hired servant shall not eat thereof. 46In one
<br> 
<br>house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth aught of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof. 47All the congregation of Israel shall keep it. 48And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land; but no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof. 49One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you.’ 50Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.
<br>51And it came to pass the selfsame day that the LORD did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their hosts.
<br>And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 2’Sanctify unto
<br>Me all the first-born, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast, it is Mine.’
<br>3And Moses said unto the people: ‘Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this place; there shall no leavened bread be eaten. 4This day ye go forth in the month Abib. 5And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, which He swore unto thy
<br> 
<br>fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this month. 6Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the LORD. 7Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee, in all thy borders. 8And thou shalt tell thy son in that day, saying: It is because of that which the LORD did for me when I came forth out of Egypt. 9And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thy hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the law of the LORD may be in thy mouth; for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt. 10Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year.
<br>11And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanite, as He swore unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it thee, 12that thou shalt set apart unto the LORD all that openeth the womb; every firstling that is a male, which thou hast coming of a beast, shall be the LORD’s. 13And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break its neck; and all the first-born of man among thy sons shalt thou redeem. 14And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying: What is this? that thou shalt say unto him: By strength of hand the LORD
<br> 
<br>brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage; 15and it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go that the LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the first-born of man, and the first-born of beast; therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all that openeth the womb, being males; but all the first-born of my sons I redeem. 16And it shall be for a sign upon thy hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes; for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt.’

<br>17And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not by the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said: ‘Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt.’ 18But God led the people about, by the way of the wilderness by the Red Sea; and the children of Israel went up armed out of the land of Egypt. 19And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him; for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying: ‘God will surely remember you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.’ 20And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness. 21And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; that they might go by day and by night: 22the pillar of cloud by
<br> 
<br>day, and the pillar of fire by night, departed not from before the people.
<br>And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 2’Speak unto
<br>the children of Israel, that they turn back and encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, before Baal-zephon, over against it shall ye encamp by the sea. 3And Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel: They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in. 4And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and he shall follow after them; and I will get Me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; and the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD.’ And they did so. 5And it was told the king of Egypt that the people were fled; and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned towards the people, and they said: ‘What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us? 6And he made ready his chariots, and took his people with him. 7And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over all of them. 8And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel; for the children of Israel went out with a high hand. 9And the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, in front of Baal- zephon. 10And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel  lifted up
<br> 
<br>their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians were marching after them; and they were sore afraid; and the children of Israel cried out unto the LORD. 11And they said unto Moses: ‘Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to bring us forth out of Egypt? 12Is not this the word that we spoke unto thee in Egypt, saying: Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it were better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.’ 13And Moses said unto the people: ‘Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which He will work for you to-day; for whereas ye have seen the Egyptians to-day, ye shall see them again no more for ever. 14The LORD will fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.’
<br>15And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘Wherefore criest thou unto Me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward. 16And lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thy hand over the sea, and divide it; and the children of Israel shall go into the midst of the sea on dry ground. 17And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall go in after them; and I will get Me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen. 18And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gotten Me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.’ 19And the angel
<br> 
<br>of God, who went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud removed from before them, and stood behind them; 20and it came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel; and there was the cloud and the darkness here, yet gave it light by night there; and the one came not near the other all the night. 21And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all the night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided. 22And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left. 23And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them into the midst of the sea, all Pharaoh’s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen. 24And it came to pass in the morning watch, that the LORD looked forth upon the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of cloud, and discomfited the host of the Egyptians. 25And He took off their chariot wheels, and made them to drive heavily; so that the Egyptians said: ‘Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD fighteth for them against the Egyptians.’
<br>26And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘Stretch out thy hand over the sea, that the waters may come back upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.’ 27And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its strength
<br> 
<br>when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea. 28And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, even all the host of Pharaoh that went in after them into the sea; there remained not so much as one of them. 29But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left. 30Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea-shore. 31And Israel saw the great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians, and the people feared the LORD; and they believed in the LORD, and in His servant Moses.
<br>
<br>Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song
<br>unto the LORD, and spoke, saying:
<br>I will sing unto the LORD, for He is highly exalted;
<br>The horse and his rider hath He thrown into the sea.
<br>2The LORD is my strength and song, And He is become my salvation; This is my God, and I will glorify
<br>Him;
<br>My father’s God, and I will exalt Him.
<br>3The LORD is a man of war, The LORD is His name.
<br>4Pharaoh’s chariots and his host hath He cast into the sea,
<br> 
<br>And his chosen captains are sunk in the Red Sea.
<br>5The deeps cover them—
<br>They went down into the depths like a stone.
<br>6Thy right hand, O LORD, glorious in power,
<br>Thy right hand, O LORD, dasheth in pieces the enemy.
<br>7And in the greatness of Thine excellency Thou overthrowest them that rise up against Thee;
<br>Thou sendest forth Thy wrath, it consumeth them as stubble.
<br>8And with the blast of Thy nostrils the waters were piled up—
<br>The floods stood upright as a heap;
<br>The deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea.
<br>9The enemy said:
<br>‘I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil;
<br>My lust shall be satisfied upon them;
<br>I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.’
<br>10Thou didst blow with Thy wind, the sea covered them;
<br>They sank as lead in the mighty waters.
<br>11Who is like unto Thee, O LORD, among the mighty?
<br>Who is like unto Thee, glorious in holiness,
<br>Fearful in praises, doing wonders?
<br>12Thou stretchedst out Thy right hand—
<br>The earth swallowed them.
<br> 
<br>13Thou in Thy love hast led the people that Thou hast redeemed;
<br>Thou hast guided them in Thy strength to Thy holy habitation.
<br>14The peoples have heard, they tremble;
<br>Pangs have taken hold on the inhabitants of Philistia.
<br>15Then were the chiefs of Edom affrighted;
<br>The mighty men of Moab, trembling taketh hold upon them;
<br>All the inhabitants of Canaan are melted away.
<br>16Terror and dread falleth upon them;
<br>By the greatness of Thine arm they are as still as a stone;
<br>Till Thy people pass over, O LORD,
<br>Till the people pass over that Thou hast gotten.
<br>17Thou bringest them in, and plantest them in the mountain of Thine inheritance,
<br>The place, O LORD, which Thou hast made for Thee to dwell in,
<br>The sanctuary, O Lord, which Thy hands have established.
<br>18The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.
<br>19For the horses of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought back the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea.
<br>20And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her
<br> 
<br>hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances. 21And Miriam sang unto them:
<br>Sing ye to the LORD, for He is highly exalted:
<br>The horse and his rider hath He thrown into the sea.
<br>
<br>22And Moses led Israel onward from the Red Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water. 23And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter. Therefore the name of it was called aMarah. 24And the people murmured against Moses, saying: ‘What shall we drink?’ 25And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD showed him a tree, and he cast it into the waters, and the waters were made sweet. There He made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there He proved them; 26and He said: ‘If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in His eyes, and wilt give ear to His commandments, and keep all His statutes, I will put none of the diseases upon thee, which I have put upon the Egyptians; for I am the LORD that healeth thee.’
<br>27And they came to Elim, where were twelve springs of water, and three score and ten palm-trees; and they encamped there by the waters.
<br>
<br>a That is, Bitterness.
<br> 
<br>And they took their journey from		Elim,	and		all	the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt. 2And the whole congregation of the	children	of	Israel		murmured against Moses and against Aaron in the wilderness; 3and the children of Israel said unto them: ‘Would that we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh-pots, when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole
<br>assembly with hunger.’
<br>4Then said the LORD unto Moses: ‘Behold, I will cause to rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a day’s portion every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in My law, or not. 5And it shall come to pass on the sixth day that they shall prepare that which they bring in, and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.’ 6And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel: ‘At even, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the land of Egypt; 7and in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the LORD; for that He hath heard your murmurings against the LORD; and what are we, that ye murmur against us?’ 8And Moses said: ‘This shall be, when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to
<br> 
<br>eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against Him; and what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against the LORD.’ 9And Moses said unto Aaron: ‘Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel: Come near before the LORD; for He hath heard your murmurings.’ 10And it came to pass, as Aaron spoke unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud. 11And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 12’I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel. Speak unto them, saying: At dusk ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God.’ 13And it came to pass at even, that the quails came up, and covered the camp; and in the morning there was a layer of dew round about the camp. 14And when the layer of dew was gone up, behold upon the face of the wilderness a fine, scale-like thing, fine as the hoar-frost on the ground. 15And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another: a‘What is it?’—for they knew not what it was. And Moses said unto them: ‘It is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat. 16This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded: Gather ye of it every man according to his eating; an
<br>
<br>a Heb. Man hu.
<br> 
<br>omer a head, according to the number of your persons, shall ye take it, every man for them that are in his tent.’ 17And the children of Israel did so, and gathered some more, some less. 18And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating. 19And Moses said unto them: ‘Let no man leave of it till the morning.’ 20Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and rotted; and Moses was wroth with them. 21And they gathered it morning by morning, every man according to his eating; and as the sun waxed hot, it melted. 22And it came to pass that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one; and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses. 23And he said unto them: ‘This is that which the LORD hath spoken: To-morrow is a solemn rest, a holy sabbath unto the LORD. Bake that which ye will bake, and seethe that which ye will seethe; and all that remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.’ 24And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade; and it did not rot, neither was there any worm therein. 25And Moses said: ‘Eat that to-day; for to-day is a sabbath unto the LORD; to-day ye shall not find it in the field. 26Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day is the sabbath, in it there shall be
<br> 
<br>none.’ 27And it came to pass on the seventh day, that there went out some of the people to gather, and they found none. 28And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘How long refuse ye to keep My commandments and My laws? 29See that the LORD hath given you the sabbath; therefore He giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh clay.’ 30So the people rested on the seventh day. 31And the house of Israel called the name thereof aManna; and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey. 32And Moses said: ‘This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded: Let an omerful of it be kept throughout your generations; that they may see the bread wherewith I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.’ 33And Moses said unto Aaron: ‘Take a jar, and put an omerful of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept throughout your generations.’ 34As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept. 35And the children of Israel did eat the manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat the manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan. 36Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.
<br> 
<br>And all the congregation of the	children		of		Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, by their stages, according to the commandment	of	the		LORD,	and encamped in Rephidim; and there was no water for the people to drink. 2Wherefore the people strove with Moses, and said: ‘Give us water that we may drink.’ And Moses said unto them:		‘Why   strive   ye		with me? wherefore do ye try the LORD?’ 3And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said: ‘Wherefore hast thou brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?’ 4And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying: ‘What shall I do unto this people? they are almost ready to stone me.’ 5And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘Pass on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith  thou  smotest the river, take in thy hand, and go. 6Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink.’ And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel. 7And the name of the place was called bMassah, and cMeribah, because of the striving of the children of Israel, and because they tried the LORD, saying: ‘Is the LORD
<br>among us, or not?’
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br> 
<br>
<br>a Heb. Man.
<br> 
<br>b That is, Trying.
<br>c That is Strife.
<br> 
<br>8Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim. 9And Moses said unto Joshua: ‘Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek; tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand.’ 10So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek; and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. 11And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed; and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed. 12But Moses’hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun. 13And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.
<br>14And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘Write this for a memorial in the book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.’ 15And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it aAdonai- nissi. 16And he said: ‘The hand upon the throne of the LORD: the LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.’

<br>1Now Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses’father-in-law,
<br> 
<br>heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel His people, how that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt. 2And Jethro, Moses’father-in- law, took Zipporah, Moses’wife, after he had sent her away, 3and her two sons; of whom the name of the one was Gershom; for he said: ‘I have been a stranger in a strange land’; 4and the name of the other was bEliezer: ‘for the God of my father was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh.’ 5And Jethro, Moses’father- in-law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness where he was encamped, at the mount of God; 6and he said unto Moses: ‘I thy father-in-law Jethro am coming unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.’ 7And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and bowed down and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent. 8And Moses told his father-in-law all that the LORD had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how the LORD delivered them. 9And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, in that He had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians. 10And Jethro said: ‘Blessed be the LORD, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh; who hath delivered the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 	 
<br>a That is, The Lord is my banner.	b Heb. El, God, and ezer, help.
<br> 
<br>people from under the hand of the Egyptians. 11Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods; yea, for that they dealt proudly against them.’ 12And Jethro, Moses’father-in-law, took a burnt-offering and sacrifices for God; and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses’father-in-law before God. 13And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people; and the people stood about Moses from the morning unto the evening. 14And when Moses’father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, he said: ‘What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand about thee from morning unto even?’ 15And Moses said unto his father-in-law: ‘Because the people come unto me to inquire of God; 16when they have a matter, it cometh unto me; and I judge between a man and his neighbour, and I make them know the statutes of God, and His laws.’ 17And Moses’father-in-law said unto him: ‘The thing that thou doest is not good. 18Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee; for the thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone. 19Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God be with thee: be thou for the people before God, and bring thou the causes unto God. 20And thou shalt teach them the statutes and the laws, and shalt show them the way wherein they must walk, and the work
<br> 
<br>that they must do. 21Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating unjust gain; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. 22And let them judge the people at all seasons; and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge themselves; so shall they make it easier for thee and bear the burden with thee. 23If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people also shall go to their place in peace.’ 24So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said. 25And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. 26And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves. 27And Moses let his father-in-law depart; and he went his way into his own land.
<br>In the third month after the children of Israel were gone
<br>forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai. 2And when they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the wilderness of Sinai, they encamped in the wilderness; and there Israel encamped before the mount. 3And Moses went up unto God,
<br> 
<br>and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain, saying: ‘Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel: 4Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles’wings, and brought you unto Myself. 5Now therefore, if ye will hearken unto My voice indeed, and keep My covenant, then ye shall be Mine own treasure from among all peoples; for all the earth is Mine; 6and ye shall be unto Me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.’ 7And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which the LORD commanded him. 8And all the people answered together, and said: ‘All that the LORD hath spoken we will do.’ And Moses reported the words of the people unto the LORD. 9And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and may also believe thee for ever.’ And Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD. 10And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘Go unto the people, and sanctify them to- day and to-morrow, and let them wash their garments, 11and be ready against the third day; for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai. 12And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying: Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it;
<br> 
<br>whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death; 13no hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live; when the ram’s horn soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.’ 14And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their garments. 15And he said unto the people: ‘Be ready against the third day; come not near a woman.’ 16And it came to pass on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunders and lightnings and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of a horn exceeding loud; and all the people that were in the camp trembled. 17And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount. 18Now mount Sinai was altogether on smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire; and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly. 19And when the voice of the horn waxed louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice. 20And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, to the top of the mount; and the LORD called Moses to the top of the mount; and Moses went up. 21And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish. 22And let the priests also, that come near to the
<br> 
<br>LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them.’ 23And Moses said unto the LORD: ‘The people cannot come up to mount Sinai; for thou didst charge us, saying: Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.’ 24And the LORD said unto him: ‘Go, get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee; but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD, lest He break forth upon them.’ 25So Moses went down unto the people, and told them.
<br>And God spoke all these words, saying:
<br>2I am the LORD thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
<br>3Thou shalt have no other gods before Me. 4Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image, nor any manner of likeness, of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; 5thou shalt not bow down unto them, nor serve them; for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate Me; 6and showing mercy unto the thousandth generation of them that love Me and keep My commandments.
<br>7Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh His name in vain.
<br> 
<br>8Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. 9Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work; 10but the seventh day is a sabbath unto the LORD thy God, in it thou shalt not do any manner of work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; 11for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested on the seventh day; wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.
<br>12Honour thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.
<br>13Thou shalt not murder.
<br>Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not steal.
<br>Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.
<br>14Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s house; thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s wife, nor his man-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour’s.
<br>
<br>15And all the people perceived the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the voice of the horn, and the mountain smoking; and when the people saw it, they trembled, and stood afar off. 16And they said unto Moses: ‘Speak thou with us, and we will hear; but let not God speak with us, lest we die.’ 17And Moses said unto the
<br> 
<br>people: ‘Fear not; for God is come to prove you, and that His fear may be before you, that ye sin not.’ 18And the people stood afar off; but Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was.
<br>19And the LORD said unto Moses: Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel: Ye yourselves have seen that I have talked with you from heaven. 20Ye shall not make with Me—gods of silver, or gods of gold, ye shall not make unto you. 21An altar of earth thou shalt make unto Me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt-offerings, and thy peace-offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen; in every place where I cause My name to be mentioned I will come unto thee and bless thee. 22And if thou make Me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stones; for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast profaned it. 23Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto Mine altar, that thy nakedness be not uncovered thereon.

<br> 
<br>out by himself. 5But if the servant shall plainly say: I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free; 6then his master shall bring him unto aGod, and shall bring him to the door, or unto the door-post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever.
<br>7And if a man sell his daughter to be a maid-servant, she shall not go out as the men-servants do. 8If she please not her master, who hath espoused her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed; to sell her unto a foreign people he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her. 9And if he espouse her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters. 10If he take him another wife, her food, her raiment, and her conjugal rights, shall he not diminish. 11And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out for nothing, without money.
<br>12He that smiteth a man, so that he dieth, shall surely be put to death.
<br>13And if a man lie not in wait, but God

<br>them.
<br> 
<br>Now these are the ordinances which thou shalt set before
<br> 
<br>cause it to come to hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he may flee.
<br> 
<br>2If thou buy a Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve; and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing. 3If he come in by himself, he shall go out by himself; if he be married, then his wife shall go out with him. 4If his master give him a wife, and she bear him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master’s, and he shall go
<br> 
<br>14And if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from Mine altar, that he may die.
<br>15And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death.
<br>
<br>a That is, the judges.
<br> 
<br>16And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.
<br>17And he that curseth his father or his mother, shall surely be put to death.
<br>18And if men contend, and one smite the other with a stone, or with his fist, and he die not, but keep his bed; 19if he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote him be quit; only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.
<br>20And if a man smite his bondman, or his bondwoman, with a rod, and he die under his hand, he shall surely be punished. 21Notwithstanding if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished; for he is his money.
<br>22And if men strive together, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart, and yet no harm follow, he shall be surely fined, according as the woman’s husband shall lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. 23But if any harm follow, then thou shalt give life for life, 24eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, 25burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.
<br>26And if a man smite the eye of his bondman, or the eye of his bondwoman, and destroy it, he shall let him go free for his eye’s sake. 27And if he smite out his bondman’s tooth, or his bondwoman’s tooth, he shall let him go free for his tooth’s sake.
<br> 
<br>28And if an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die, the ox shall be surely stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be quit. 29But if the ox was wont to gore in time past, and warning hath been given to its owner, and he hath not kept it in, but it hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and its owner also shall be put to death. 30If there be laid on him a ransom, then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatsoever is laid upon him. 31Whether it have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him. 32If the ox gore a bondman or a bondwoman, he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.
<br>33And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein, 34the owner of the pit shall make it good; he shall give money unto the owner of them, and the dead beast shall be his.
<br>35And if one man’s ox hurt another’s, so that it dieth; then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the price of it; and the dead also they shall divide. 36Or if it be known that the ox was wont to gore in time past, and its owner hath not kept it in; he shall surely pay ox for ox, and the dead beast shall be his own.
<br>37If a man steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it, he shall pay five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a
<br> 
<br>sheep. 1If a thief be found breaking in, and be smitten so
<br>that he dieth, there shall be no bloodguiltiness for him. 2If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be bloodguiltiness for him—he shall make restitution; if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft. 3If the theft be found in his hand alive, whether it be ox, or ass, or sheep, he shall pay double.
<br>4If a man cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall let his beast loose, and it feed in another man’s field; of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make restitution.
<br>5If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the shocks of corn, or the standing corn, or the field are consumed; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.
<br>6If a man deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep, and it be stolen out of the man’s house; if the thief be found, he shall pay double. 7If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall come near unto aGod, to see whether he have not put his hand unto his neighbour’s goods. 8For every matter of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing, whereof one saith: ‘This is it, ‘the cause of both parties shall come before God; he whom God shall condemn shall pay double unto his neighbour.
<br>
<br> 
<br>9If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep, and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it; 10the oath of the LORD shall be between them both, to see whether he have not put his hand unto his neighbour’s goods; and the owner thereof shall accept it, and he shall not make restitution. 11But if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof. 12If it be torn in pieces, let him bring it for witness; he shall not make good that which was torn.
<br>13And if a man borrow aught of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or die, the owner thereof not being with it, he shall surely make restitution. 14If the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good; if it be a hireling, he loseth his hire.
<br>15And if a man entice a virgin that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely pay a dowry for her to be his wife. 16If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.
<br>17Thou shalt not suffer a sorceress to live.
<br>18Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.
<br>19He that sacrificeth unto the gods, save unto the LORD only, shall be utterly destroyed.
<br>20And a stranger shalt thou not wrong, neither shalt thou oppress him; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt. 21Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child. 22 If thou
<br> 
<br>afflict them in any wise—for if they cry at all unto Me, I will surely hear their cry— 23My wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.
<br>24If thou lend money to any of My people, even to the poor with thee, thou shalt not be to him as a creditor; neither shall ye lay upon him interest. 25If thou at all take thy neighbour’s garment to pledge, thou shalt restore it unto him by that the sun goeth down; 26for that is his only covering, it is his garment for his skin; wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto Me, that I will hear; for I am gracious.
<br>27Thou shalt not revile aGod, nor curse a ruler of thy people. 28Thou shalt not delay to offer of the fulness of thy harvest, and of the outflow of thy presses. The first-born of thy sons shalt thou give unto Me. 29Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, and with thy sheep; seven days it shall be with its dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it Me. 30And ye shall be holy men unto Me; therefore ye shall not eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs.
<br>Thou shalt not utter a false report; put not thy hand with
<br>the wicked to be an unrighteous witness. 2Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou bear witness in a cause to turn aside
<br> 
<br>after a multitude to pervert justice; 3neither shalt thou favour a poor man in his cause.
<br>4If thou meet thine enemy’s ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again.
<br>5If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under its burden, thou shalt forbear to pass by him; thou shalt surely release it with him.
<br>6Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause. 7Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not; for I will not justify the wicked. 8And thou shalt take no gift; for a gift blindeth them that have sight, and perverteth the words of the righteous. 9And a stranger shalt thou not oppress; for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.
<br>10And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and gather in the increase thereof; 11but the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie fallow, that the poor of thy people may eat; and what they leave the beast of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard. 12Six days thou shalt do thy work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest; that thine ox and thine ass may have rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed. 13And in all things that I have said unto you take ye heed; and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br> 
<br>14Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto Me in the year. 15The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep; seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, at the time appointed in the month Abib—for in it thou camest out from Egypt; and none shall appear before Me empty; 16and the feast of harvest, the first- fruits of thy labours, which thou sowest in the field; and the feast of ingathering, at the end of the year, when thou gatherest in thy labours out of the field. 17Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord GOD.
<br>18Thou shalt not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of My feast remain all night until the morning. 19The choicest first-fruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother’s milk.
<br>20Behold, I send an angel before thee, to keep thee by the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared. 21Take heed of him, and hearken unto his voice; be not rebellious against him; for he will not pardon your transgression; for My name is in him. 22But if thou shalt indeed hearken unto his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries. 23For Mine angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the
<br> 
<br>Canaanite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; and I will cut them off. 24Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their doings; but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and break in pieces their pillars. 25And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and He will bless thy bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee. 26None shall miscarry, nor be barren, in thy land; the number of thy days I will fulfil. 27I will send My terror before thee, and will discomfit all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee. 28And I will send the hornet before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee. 29I will not drive them out from before thee in one year, lest the land become desolate, and the beasts of the field multiply against thee. 30By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou be increased, and inherit the land. 31And I will set thy border from the Red Sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness unto athe River; for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out before thee. 32Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods. 33They shall not dwell in thy land—lest they make thee sin against Me, for thou wilt serve
<br>
<br>
<br>a That is, the Euphrates.
<br> 
<br>their gods—for they will be a snare unto thee.
<br>
<br>And unto Moses He said: ‘Come up unto the LORD, thou,
<br>and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship ye afar off; 2and Moses alone shall come near unto the LORD; but they shall not come near; neither shall the people go up with him.’ 3And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD, and all the ordinances; and all the people answered with one voice, and said: ‘All the words which the Lord hath spoken will we do.’ 4And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD, and rose up early in the morning, and builded an altar under the mount, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel. 5And he sent the young men of the children of Israel, who offered burnt-offerings, and sacrificed peace- offerings of oxen unto the LORD. 6And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basins; and half of the blood he dashed against the altar. 7And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the hearing of the people; and they said: ‘All that the LORD hath spoken will we do, and obey.’ 8And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said: ‘Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD hath made with you in agreement with all
<br> 
<br>they saw the God of Israel; and there was under His feet the like of a paved work of sapphire stone, and the like of the very heaven for clearness. 11And upon the nobles of the children of Israel He laid not His hand; and they beheld God, and did eat and drink.
<br>12And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘Come up to Me into the mount and be there; and I will give thee the tables of stone, and the law and the commandment, which I have written, that thou mayest teach them.’ 13And Moses rose up, and Joshua his minister; and Moses went up into the mount of God. 14And unto the elders he said: ‘Tarry ye here for us, until we come back unto you; and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you; whosoever hath a cause, let him come near unto them.’ 15And Moses went up into the mount, and the cloud covered the mount. 16And the glory of the LORD abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days; and the seventh day He called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud. 17And the appearance of the glory of the LORD was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel. 18And Moses entered into the midst of the cloud, and went up into the mount; and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights.
<br>תרומה
<br> 
<br>these words.’ 9Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; 10and
<br> 
<br>And   the   LORD     spoke unto Moses, saying: 2’Speak unto
<br>the children of Israel, that they take for
<br> 
<br>Me an offering; of every man whose heart maketh him willing ye shall take My offering. 3And this is the offering which ye shall take of them: gold, and silver, and brass; 4and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats’hair; 5and rams’skins dyed red, and sealskins, and acacia-wood; 6oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense; 7onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate. 8And let them make Me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them. 9According to all that I show thee, the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the furniture thereof, even so shall ye make it.
<br>10And they shall make an ark of acacia-wood: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof. 11And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without shalt thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about. 12And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in the four feet thereof; and two rings shall be on the one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it. 13And thou shalt make staves of acacia-wood, and overlay them with gold. 14And thou shalt put the staves into the rings on the sides of the ark, wherewith to bear the ark. 15The staves shall be in the rings of the ark; they shall not be taken from it. 16And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony
<br> 
<br>which I shall give thee. 17And thou shalt make an ark-cover of pure gold: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof. 18And thou shalt make two cherubim of gold; of beaten work shalt thou make them, at the two ends of the ark-cover. 19And make one cherub at the one end, and one cherub at the other end; of one piece with the ark-cover shall ye make the cherubim of the two ends thereof. 20And the cherubim shall spread out their wings on high, screening the ark-cover with their wings, with their faces one to another; toward the ark-cover shall the faces of the cherubim be. 21And thou shalt put the ark-cover above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee. 22And there I will meet with thee, and I will speak with thee from above the ark- cover, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel.
<br>23And thou shalt make a table of acacia-wood: two cubits shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof. 24And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, and make thereto a crown of gold round about. 25And thou shalt make unto it a border of a handbreadth round about, and thou shalt make a golden crown to the border thereof round about. 26And thou shalt make for it four rings of gold,
<br> 
<br>and put the rings in the four corners that are on the four feet thereof. 27Close by the border shall the rings be, for places for the staves to bear the table. 28And thou shalt make the staves of acacia-wood, and overlay them with gold, that the table may be borne with them. 29And thou shalt make the dishes thereof, and the pans thereof, and the jars thereof, and the bowls thereof, wherewith to pour out; of pure gold shalt thou make them. 30And thou shalt set upon the table showbread before Me alway.
<br>31And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work shall the candlestick be made, even its base, and its shaft; its cups, its knops, and its flowers, shall be of one piece with it. 32And there shall be six branches going out of the sides thereof: three branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and three branches of the candle-stick out of the other side thereof; 33three cups made like almond-blossoms in one branch, a knop and a flower; and three cups made like almond-blossoms in the other branch, a knop and a flower; so for the six branches going out of the candlestick. 34And in the candlestick four cups made like almond-blossoms, the knops thereof, and the flowers thereof. 35And a knop under two branches of one piece with it, and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, for the six branches going out of the candlestick.
<br> 
<br>36Their knops and their branches shall be of one piece with it; the whole of it one beaten work of pure gold. 37And thou shalt make the lamps thereof, seven; and they shall light the lamps thereof, to give light over against it. 38And the tongs thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, shall be of pure gold. 39Of a talent of pure gold shall it be made, with all these vessels. 40And see that thou make them after their pattern, which is being shown thee in the mount.
<br>Moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle with ten curtains: of
<br>fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, with cherubim the work of the skilful workman shalt thou make them. 2The length of each curtain shall be eight and twenty cubits, and the breadth of each curtain four cubits; all the curtains shall have one measure. 3Five curtains shall be coupled together one to another; and the other five curtains shall be coupled one to another. 4And thou shalt make loops of blue upon the edge of the one curtain that is outmost in the first set; and likewise shalt thou make in the edge of the curtain that is outmost in the second set. 5Fifty loops shalt thou make in the one curtain, and fifty loops shalt thou make in the edge of the curtain that is in the second set; the loops shall be opposite one to another. 6And thou shalt make fifty clasps of gold, and couple the curtains one to another with the clasps, that the tabernacle may be one whole. 7And
<br> 
<br>thou shalt make curtains of goats’hair for a tent over the tabernacle; eleven curtains shalt thou make them. 8The length of each curtain shall be thirty cubits, and the breadth of each curtain four cubits; the eleven curtains shall have one measure. 9And thou shalt couple five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves, and shalt double over the sixth curtain in the forefront of the tent. 10And thou shalt make fifty loops on the edge of the one curtain that is outmost in the first set, and fifty loops upon the edge of the curtain which is outmost in the second set. 11And thou shalt make fifty clasps of brass, and put the clasps into the loops, and couple the tent together, that it may be one. 12And as for the overhanging part that remaineth of the curtains of the tent, the half curtain that remaineth over shall hang over the back of the tabernacle. 13And the cubit on the one side, and the cubit on the other side, of that which remaineth over in the length of the curtains of the tent, shall hang over the sides of the tabernacle on this side and on that side, to cover it. 14And thou shalt make a covering for the tent of rams’skins dyed red and a covering of sealskins above.
<br>15And thou shalt make the boards for the tabernacle of acacia-wood, standing up. 16Ten cubits shall be the length of a board, and a cubit and a half the breadth of each board. 17Two tenons shall there be in each board, joined one to another; thus shalt thou
<br> 
<br>make for all the boards of the tabernacle. 18And thou shalt make the boards for the tabernacle, twenty boards for the south side southward: 19And thou shalt make forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards: two sockets under one board for its two tenons, and two sockets under another board for its two tenons; 20and for the second side of the tabernacle, on the north side, twenty boards. 21And their forty sockets of silver: two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board. 22And for the hinder part of the tabernacle westward thou shalt make six boards. 23And two boards shalt thou make for the corners of the tabernacle in the hinder part. 24And they shall be double beneath, and in like manner they shall be complete unto the top thereof unto the first ring; thus shall it be for them both; they shall be for the two corners. 25Thus there shall be eight boards, and their sockets of silver, sixteen sockets: two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board. 26And thou shalt make bars of acacia-wood: five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle, 27and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the side of the tabernacle, for the hinder part westward; 28and the middle bar in the midst of the boards, which shall pass through from end to end. 29And thou shalt overlay the boards with gold, and make their rings of gold for holders for the bars; and thou shalt
<br> 
<br>overlay the bars with gold. 30And thou shalt rear up the tabernacle according to the fashion thereof which hath been shown thee in the mount.
<br>31And thou shalt make a veil of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; with cherubim the work of the skilful workman shall it be made. 32And thou shalt hang it upon four pillars of acacia overlaid with gold, their hooks being of gold, upon four sockets of silver. 33And thou shalt hang up the veil under the clasps, and shalt bring in thither within the veil the ark of the testimony; and the veil shall divide unto you between the holy place and the most holy. 34And thou shalt put the ark-cover upon the ark of the testimony in the most holy place. 35And thou shalt set the table without the veil, and the candlestick over against the table on the side of the tabernacle toward the south; and thou shalt put the table on the north side. 36And thou shalt make a screen for the door of the Tent, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, the work of the weaver in colours. 37And thou shalt make for the screen five pillars of acacia, and overlay them with gold; their hooks shall be of gold; and thou shalt cast five sockets of brass for them.
<br>And thou shalt make the altar of   acacia-wood,   five   cubits
<br>long, and five cubits broad; the altar shall be four-square; and the height thereof shall be three cubits. 2And thou shalt make the horns of it upon the
<br> 
<br>four corners thereof; the horns thereof shall be of one piece with it; and thou shalt overlay it with brass. 3And thou shalt make its pots to take away its ashes, and its shovels, and its basins, and its flesh-hooks, and its fire-pans; all the vessels thereof thou shalt make of brass. 4And thou shalt make for it a grating of network of brass; and upon the net shalt thou make four brazen rings in the four corners thereof. 5And thou shalt put it under the ledge round the altar beneath, that the net may reach halfway up the altar. 6And thou shalt make staves for the altar, staves of acacia-wood, and overlay them with brass. 7And the staves thereof shall be put into the rings, and the staves shall be upon the two sides of the altar, in bearing it. 8Hollow with planks shalt thou make it; as it hath been shown thee in the mount, so shall they make it.
<br>9And thou shalt make the court of the tabernacle: for the south side southward there shall be hangings for the court of fine twined linen a hundred cubits long for one side. 10And the pillars thereof shall be twenty, and their sockets twenty, of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets shall be of silver. 11And likewise for the north side in length there shall be hangings a hundred cubits long, and the pillars thereof twenty, and their sockets twenty, of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver. 12And for the breadth of the court on the west side shall be hangings of fifty
<br> 
<br>cubits: their pillars ten, and their sockets ten. 13And the breadth of the court on the east side eastward shall be fifty cubits. 14The hangings for the one side [of the gate] shall be fifteen cubits: their pillars three, and their sockets three. 15And for the other side shall be hangings of fifteen cubits: their pillars three, and their sockets three. 16And for the gate of the court shall be a screen of twenty cubits, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, the work of the weaver in colours: their pillars four, and their sockets four. 17All the pillars of the court round about shall be filleted with silver; their hooks of silver, and their sockets of brass. 18The length of the court shall be a hundred cubits, and the breadth fifty every where, and the height five cubits, of fine twined linen, and their sockets of brass. 19All the instruments of the tabernacle in all the service thereof, and all the pins thereof, and all the pins of the court, shall be of brass.
<br>תצוה
<br>20And thou shalt command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure olive oil beaten for the light, to cause a lamp to burn continually. 21In the tent of meeting, without the veil which is before the testimony, Aaron and his sons shall set it in order, to burn from evening to morning before the LORD; it shall be a statute for ever throughout their generations on the behalf of the children of Israel.
<br> 
<br>And bring thou near unto thee Aaron thy brother, and his
<br>sons with him, from among the children of Israel, that they may minister unto Me in the priest’s office, even Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron’s sons. 2And thou shalt make holy garments for Aaron thy brother, for splendour and for beauty. 3And thou shalt speak unto all that are wise-hearted, whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom, that they make Aaron’s garments to sanctify him, that he may minister unto Me in the priest’s office. 4And these are the garments which they shall make: a breastplate, and an ephod, and a robe, and a tunic of chequer work, a mitre, and a girdle; and they shall make holy garments for Aaron thy brother, and his sons, that he may minister unto Me in the priest’s office. 5And they shall take the gold, and the blue, and the purple, and the scarlet, and the fine linen.
<br>6And they shall make the ephod of gold, of blue, and purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen, the work of the skilful workman. 7It shall have two shoulder-pieces joined to the two ends thereof, that it may be joined together. 8And the skilfully woven band, which is upon it, wherewith to gird it on, shall be like the work thereof and of the same piece: of gold, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen. 9And thou shalt take two onyx stones, and grave on them the names of the children of Israel: 10six of their
<br> 
<br>names on the one stone, and the names of the six that remain on the other stone, according to their birth. 11With the work of an engraver in stone, like the engravings of a signet, shalt thou engrave the two stones, according to the names of the children of Israel; thou shalt make them to be inclosed in settings of gold. 12And thou shalt put the two stones upon the shoulder- pieces of the ephod, to be stones of memorial for the children of Israel; and Aaron shall bear their names before the LORD upon his two shoulders for a memorial.
<br>13And thou shalt make settings of gold; 14and two chains of pure gold; of plaited thread shalt thou make them, of wreathen work; and thou shalt put the wreathen chains on the settings.
<br>15And thou shalt make a breastplate of judgment, the work of the skilful workman; like the work of the ephod thou shalt make it: of gold, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, shalt thou make it. 16Four-square it shall be and double: a span shall be the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof. 17And thou shalt set in it settings of stones, four rows of stones: a row of carnelian, topaz, and smaragd shall be the first row; 18and the second row a carbuncle, a sapphire, and an emerald; 19and the third row a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst; 20and the fourth row a beryl, and an onyx, and a jasper; they shall be inclosed in gold in their settings. 21And the stones shall be according to
<br> 
<br>the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names; like the engravings of a signet, every one according to his name, they shall be for the twelve tribes. 22And thou shalt make upon the breastplate plaited chains of wreathen work of pure gold. 23And thou shalt make upon the breastplate two rings of gold, and shalt put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate. 24And thou shalt put the two wreathen chains of gold on the two rings at the ends of the breastplate. 25And the other two ends of the two wreathen chains thou shalt put on the two settings, and put them on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, in the forepart thereof. 26And thou shalt make two rings of gold, and thou shalt put them upon the two ends of the breastplate, upon the edge thereof, which is toward the side of the ephod inward. 27And thou shalt make two rings of gold, and shalt put them on the two shoulder-pieces of the ephod underneath, in the forepart thereof, close by the coupling thereof, above the skilfully woven band of the ephod. 28And they shall bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto the rings of the ephod with a thread of blue, that it may be upon the skilfully woven band of the ephod, and that the breastplate be not loosed from the ephod. 29And Aaron shall bear the names of the children of Israel in the breastplate of judgment upon his heart, when he goeth in unto the holy place, for a memorial before the LORD continually.
<br> 
<br>30And thou shalt put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim; and they shall be upon Aaron’s heart, when he goeth in before the LORD; and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel upon his heart before the LORD continually.
<br>31And thou shalt make the robe of the ephod all of blue. 32And it shall have a hole for the head in the midst thereof; it shall have a binding of woven work round about the hole of it, as it were the hole of a coat of mail that it be not rent. 33And upon the skirts of it thou shalt make pomegranates of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, round about the skirts thereof; and bells of gold between them round about: 34a golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a pomegranate, upon the skirts of the robe round about. 35And it shall be upon Aaron to minister; and the sound thereof shall be heard when he goeth in unto the holy place before the LORD, and when he cometh out, that he die not.
<br>36And thou shalt make a plate of pure gold, and engrave upon it, like the engravings of a signet: HOLY TO THE LORD. 37And thou shalt put it on a thread of blue, and it shall be upon the mitre; upon the forefront of the mitre it shall be. 38And it shall be upon Aaron’s forehead, and Aaron shall bear the iniquity committed in the holy things, which the children of Israel shall hallow, even in all their holy gifts; and it shall be always upon his
<br> 
<br>forehead, that they may be accepted before the LORD. 39And thou shalt weave the tunic in chequer work of fine linen, and thou shalt make a mitre of fine linen, and thou shalt make a girdle, the work of the weaver in colours. 40And for Aaron’s sons thou shalt make tunics, and thou shalt make for them girdles, and head-tires shalt thou make for them, for splendour and for beauty. 41And thou shalt put them upon Aaron thy brother, and upon his sons with him; and shalt anoint them, and consecrate them, and sanctify them, that they may minister unto Me in the priest’s office. 42And thou shalt make them linen breeches to cover the flesh of their nakedness; from the loins even unto the thighs they shall reach. 43And they shall be upon Aaron, and upon his sons, when they go in unto the tent of meeting, or when they come near unto the altar to minister in the holy place; that they bear not iniquity, and die; it shall be a statute for ever unto him and unto his seed after him.
<br>
<br>And this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow
<br>them, to minister unto Me in the priest’s office: take one young bullock and two rams without blemish, 2and unleavened bread, and cakes unleavened mingled with oil, and wafers unleavened spread with oil; of fine wheaten flour shalt thou make them. 3And thou shalt put them into one basket, and bring them in the basket, with the bullock and the two
<br> 
<br>rams. 4And Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring unto the door of the tent of meeting, and shalt wash them with water. 5And thou shalt take the garments, and put upon Aaron the tunic, and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate, and gird him with the skilfully woven band of the ephod. 6And thou shalt set the mitre upon his head, and put the holy crown upon the mitre. 7Then shalt thou take the anointing oil, and pour it upon his head, and anoint him. 8And thou shalt bring his sons, and put tunics upon them. 9And thou shalt gird them with girdles, Aaron and his sons, and bind head-tires on them; and they shall have the priesthood by a perpetual statute; and thou shalt consecrate Aaron and his sons. 10And thou shalt bring the bullock before the tent of meeting; and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock. 11And thou shalt kill the bullock before the LORD, at the door of the tent of meeting. 12And thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock, and put it upon the horns of the altar with thy finger; and thou shalt pour out all the remaining blood at the base of the altar. 13And thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards, and the lobe above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and make them smoke upon the altar. 14But the flesh of the bullock, and its skin, and its dung, shalt thou burn with fire without the camp; it is a sin-offering. 15Thou shalt also take the one ram; and
<br> 
<br>Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the ram. 16And thou shalt slay the ram, and thou shalt take its blood, and dash it round about against the altar. 17And thou shalt cut the ram into its pieces, and wash its inwards, and its legs, and put them with its pieces, and with its head. 18And thou shalt make the whole ram smoke upon the altar; it is a burnt- offering unto the LORD; it is a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD. 19And thou shalt take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the ram. 20Then shalt thou kill the ram, and take of its blood, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and upon the tip of the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot, and dash the blood against the altar round about. 21And thou shalt take of the blood that is upon the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons with him; and he and his garments shall be hallowed, and his sons and his sons’garments with him. 22Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat, and the fat tail, and the fat that covereth the inwards, and the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the right thigh; for it is a ram of consecration; 23and one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, out of the basket of unleavened bread that is
<br> 
<br>before the LORD. 24And thou shalt put the whole upon the hands of Aaron, and upon the hands of his sons; and shalt wave them for a wave-offering before the LORD. 25And thou shalt take them from their hands, and make them smoke on the altar upon the burnt- offering, for a sweet savour before the LORD; it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD. 26And thou shalt take the breast of Aaron’s ram of consecration, and wave it for a wave- offering before the LORD; and it shall be thy portion. 27And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave- offering, and the thigh of the heave- offering, which is waved, and which is heaved up, of the ram of consecration, even of that which is Aaron’s, and of that which is his sons’. 28And it shall be for Aaron and his sons as a due for ever from the children of Israel; for it is a heave-offering; and it shall be a heave-offering from the children of Israel of their sacrifices of peace- offerings, even their heave-offering unto the LORD. 29And the holy garments of Aaron shall be for his sons after him, to be anointed in them, and to be consecrated in them. 30Seven days shall the son that is priest in his stead put them on, even he who cometh into the tent of meeting to minister in the holy place. 31And thou shalt take the ram of consecration, and seethe its flesh in a holy place. 32And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket, at the door of the tent of
<br> 
<br>meeting. 33And they shall eat those things wherewith atonement was made, to consecrate and to sanctify them; but a stranger shall not eat thereof, because they are holy. 34And if aught of the flesh of the consecration, or of the bread, remain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire; it shall not be eaten, because it is holy. 35And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according to all that I have commanded thee; seven days shalt thou consecrate them. 36And every day shalt thou offer the bullock of sin- offering, beside the other offerings of atonement; and thou shalt do the purification upon the altar when thou makest atonement for it; and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify it. 37Seven days thou shalt make atonement for the altar, and sanctify it; thus shall the altar be most holy; whatsoever toucheth the altar shall be holy.
<br>38Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar: two lambs of the first year day by day continually. 39The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb thou shalt offer at dusk. 40And with the one lamb a tenth part of an ephah of fine flour mingled with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of a hin of wine for a drink-offering. 41And the other lamb thou shalt offer at dusk, and shalt do thereto according to the meal-offering of the morning, and according to the drink-offering thereof, for a sweet savour, an offering made
<br> 
<br>by fire unto the LORD. 42It shall be a continual burnt-offering throughout your generations at the door of the tent of meeting before the LORD, where I will meet with you, to speak there unto thee. 43And there I will meet with the children of Israel; and [the Tent] shall be sanctified by My glory. 44And I will sanctify the tent of meeting, and the altar; Aaron also and his sons will I sanctify, to minister to Me in the priest’s office. 45And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God. 46And they shall know that I am the LORD their God, that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them. I am the LORD their God.
<br>And thou shalt make an altar to   burn   incense   upon;   of
<br>acacia-wood shalt thou make it. 2A cubit shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof; foursquare shall it be; and two cubits shall be the height thereof; the horns thereof shall be of one piece with it. 3And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about. 4And two golden rings shalt thou make for it under the crown thereof, upon the two ribs thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make them; and they shall be for places for staves wherewith to bear it. 5And thou shalt make the staves of acacia-wood, and overlay them with gold. 6And thou shalt put it before the
<br> 
<br>veil that is by the ark of the testimony, before the ark-cover that is over the testimony, where I will meet with thee. 7And Aaron shall burn thereon incense of sweet spices; every morning, when he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn it. 8And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at dusk, he shall burn it, a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your generations. 9Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt- offering, nor meal-offering; and ye shall pour no drink-offering thereon. 10And Aaron shall make atonement upon the horns of it once in the year; with the blood of the sin-offering of atonement once in the year shall he make atonement for it throughout your generations; it is most holy unto the LORD.’

<br>11And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 12’When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel, according to their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the LORD, when thou numberest them; that there be no plague among them, when thou numberest them. 13This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary—the shekel is twenty gerahs—half a shekel for an offering to the LORD. 14Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from twenty years old and upward, shall give the offering of the LORD. 15The rich shall not give more, and the poor
<br> 
<br>shall not give less, than the half shekel, when they give the offering of the LORD, to make atonement for your souls. 16And thou shalt take the atonement money from the children of Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tent of meeting, that it may be a memorial for the children of Israel before the LORD, to make atonement for your souls.’
<br>17And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 18’Thou shalt also make a laver of brass, and the base thereof of brass, whereat to wash; and thou shalt put it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein. 19And Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat; 20when they go into the tent of meeting, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to cause an offering made by fire to smoke unto the LORD; 21so they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not; and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to his seed throughout their generations.’
<br>22Moreover the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 23’Take thou also unto thee the chief spices, of flowing myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty, 24and of cassia five hundred, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of olive oil a hin. 25And thou shalt make it a holy anointing oil, a perfume compounded
<br> 
<br>after the art of the perfumer; it shall be a holy anointing oil. 26And thou shalt anoint therewith the tent of meeting, and the ark of the testimony, 27and the table and all the vessels thereof, and the candlestick and the vessels thereof, and the altar of incense, 28and the altar of burnt-offering with all the vessels thereof, and the laver and the base thereof. 29And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy; whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy. 30And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and sanctify them, that they may minister unto Me in the priest’s office. 31And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying: This shall be a holy anointing oil unto Me throughout your generations. 32Upon the flesh of man shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make any like it, according to the composition thereof; it is holy, and it shall be holy unto you. 33Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger, he shall be cut off from his people.’
<br>34And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘Take unto thee sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; sweet spices with pure frankincense; of each shall there be a like weight. 35And thou shalt make of it incense, a perfume after the art of the perfumer, seasoned with salt, pure and holy. 36And thou shalt beat some of it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tent of meeting, where I will meet with thee; it shall be unto you most holy.
<br> 
<br>37And the incense which thou shalt make, according to the composition thereof ye shall not make for yourselves; it shall be unto thee holy for the LORD. 38Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereof, he shall be cut off from his people.’
<br>And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 2’See, I have
<br>called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah; 3and I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship, 4to devise skilful works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, 5and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all manner of workmanship. 6And I, behold, I have appointed with him Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the hearts of all that are wise-hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee: 7the tent of meeting, and the ark of the testimony, and the ark-cover that is thereupon, and all the furniture of the Tent; 8and the table and its vessels, and the pure candlestick with all its vessels, and the altar of incense; 9and the altar of burnt- offering with all its vessels, and the laver and its base; 10and the plaited garments, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest’s office; 11and the anointing oil, and the incense of sweet  spices for the holy
<br> 
<br>place; according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do.’
<br>12And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 13’Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying: Verily ye shall keep My sabbaths, for it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations, that ye may know that I am the LORD who sanctify you. 14Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore, for it is holy unto you; every one that profaneth it shall surely be put to death; for whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people. 15Six days shall work be done; but on the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, holy to the LORD; whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death. 16Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant. 17It is a sign between Me and the children of Israel for ever; for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day He ceased from work and rested.’
<br>18And He gave unto Moses, when He had made an end of speaking with him upon mount Sinai, the two tables of the testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.
<br>And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down
<br>from the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him: ‘Up, make us a god who shall go before us; for as for this
<br> 
<br>Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.’ 2And Aaron said unto them: ‘Break off the golden rings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them unto me.’ 3And all the people broke off the golden rings which were in their ears, and brought them unto Aaron. 4And he received it at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, and made it a molten calf; and they said: ‘This is thy god, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.’ 5And when Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said: ‘To-morrow shall be a feast to the LORD.’ 6And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt- offerings, and brought peace-offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to make merry.
<br>7And the LORD spoke unto Moses: ‘Go, get thee down; for thy people, that thou broughtest up out of the land of Egypt, have dealt corruptly; 8they have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed unto it, and said: This is thy god, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.’ 9And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people. 10Now therefore let Me alone, that My wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume
<br> 
<br>them; and I will make of thee a great nation.’ 11And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said: ‘LORD, why doth Thy wrath wax hot against Thy people, that Thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand? 12Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, saying: For evil did He bring them forth, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from Thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against Thy people. 13Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, Thy servants, to whom Thou didst swear by Thine own self, and saidst unto them: I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.’ 14And the LORD repented of the evil which He said He would do unto His people.
<br>15And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, with the two tables of the testimony in his hand; tables that were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written. 16And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables. 17And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses: ‘There is a noise of war in the camp.’ 18And he said: ‘It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome, but the
<br> 
<br>noise of them that sing do I hear.’ 19And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf and the dancing; and Moses’anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and broke them beneath the mount. 20And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it with fire, and ground it to powder, and strewed it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it. 21And Moses said unto Aaron: ‘What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought a great sin upon them?’ 22And Aaron said: ‘Let not the anger of my lord wax hot; thou knowest the people, that they are set on evil. 23So they said unto me: Make us a god, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him. 24And I said unto them: Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it off; so they gave it me; and I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.’ 25And when Moses saw that the people were broken loose—for Aaron had let them loose for a derision among their enemies— 26then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said: ‘Whoso is on the LORD’S side, let him come unto me.’ And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him. 27And he said unto them: ‘Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: Put ye every man his sword upon his thigh, and go to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his
<br> 
<br>brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.’ 28And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses; and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men. 29And Moses said: ‘Consecrate yourselves to-day to the LORD, for every man hath been against his son and against his brother; that He may also bestow upon you a blessing this day.’ 30And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people: ‘Ye have sinned a great sin; and now I will go up unto the LORD, peradventure I shall make atonement for your sin.’ 31And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said: ‘Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them a god of gold. 32Yet now, if Thou wilt forgive their sin—; and if not, blot me, I pray Thee, out of Thy book which Thou hast written.’ 33And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘Whosoever hath sinned against Me, him will I blot out of My book. 34And now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee; behold, Mine angel shall go before thee; nevertheless in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin upon them.’ 35And the LORD smote the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.
<br>And the LORD spoke unto Moses: ‘Depart, go up hence,
<br>thou and the people that thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land of which I swore unto Abraham,   to   Isaac,   and   to   Jacob,
<br> 
<br>saying: Unto thy seed will I give it— 2and I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite— 3unto a land flowing with milk and honey; for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou art a stiffnecked people; lest I consume thee in the way.’ 4And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned; and no man did put on him his ornaments. 5And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘Say unto the children of Israel: Ye are a stiffnecked people; if I go up into the midst of thee for one moment, I shall consume thee; therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.’ 6And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments from mount Horeb onward.
<br>7Now Moses used to take the tent and to pitch it without the camp, afar off from the camp; and he called it The tent of meeting. And it came to pass, that every one that sought the LORD went out unto the tent of meeting, which was without the camp. 8And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the Tent, that all the people rose up, and stood, every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the Tent. 9And it came to pass, when Moses entered into the Tent, the pillar of cloud descended, and stood at the door of the Tent; and [the LORD] spoke with Moses. 10And when all the people saw the pillar of
<br> 
<br>cloud stand at the door of the Tent, all the people rose up and worshipped, every man at his tent door. 11And the LORD spoke unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he would return into the camp; but his minister Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the Tent.
<br>12And Moses said unto the LORD: ‘See, Thou sayest unto me: Bring up this people; and Thou hast not let me know whom Thou wilt send with me. Yet Thou hast said: I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in My sight. 13Now therefore, I pray Thee, if I have found grace in Thy sight, show me now Thy ways, that I may know Thee, to the end that I may find grace in Thy sight; and consider that this nation is Thy people.’ 14And He said: ‘My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest.’ 15And he said unto Him: ‘If Thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence. 16For wherein now shall it be known that I have found grace in Thy sight, I and Thy people? is it not in that Thou goest with us, so that we are distinguished, I and Thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth?’
<br>17And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken, for thou hast found grace in My sight, and I know thee by name.’ 18And he said: ‘Show me, I pray Thee, Thy glory.’ 19And He said: ‘I will make all My goodness pass before
<br> 
<br>thee, and will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy.’ 20And He said: ‘Thou canst not see My face, for man shall not see Me and live.’ 21And the LORD said: ‘Behold, there is a place by Me, and thou shalt stand upon the rock. 22And it shall come to pass, while My glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a cleft of the rock, and will cover thee with My hand until I have passed by. 23And I will take away My hand, and thou shalt see My back; but My face shall not be seen.’
<br>And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘Hew thee two tables
<br>of stone like unto the first; and I will write upon the tables the words that were on the first tables, which thou didst break. 2And be ready by the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and present thyself there to Me on the top of the mount. 3And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount.’ 4And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand two tables of stone. 5And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD. 6And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed: ‘The LORD, the LORD,
<br> 
<br>God, merciful and gracious, long- suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth; 7keeping mercy unto the thousandth generation, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin; and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children’s children, unto the third and unto the fourth generation.’ 8And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped. 9And he said: ‘If now I have found grace in Thy sight, O Lord, let the Lord, I pray Thee, go in the midst of us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Thine inheritance.’ 10And He said: ‘Behold, I make a covenant; before all thy people I will do marvels, such as have not been wrought in all the earth, nor in any nation; and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the LORD that I am about to do with thee, that it is tremendous. 11Observe thou that which I am commanding thee this day; behold, I am driving out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite. 12Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest they be for a snare in the midst of thee. 13But ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and ye shall cut down their Asherim. 14For thou shalt bow down to no other god; for the LORD,
<br> 
<br>whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God; 15lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go astray after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods, and they call thee, and thou eat of their sacrifice; 16and thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go astray after their gods, and make thy sons go astray after their gods. 17Thou shalt make thee no molten gods. 18The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, at the time appointed in the month Abib, for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt. 19All that openeth the womb is Mine; and of all thy cattle thou shalt sanctify the males, the firstlings of ox and sheep. 20And the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break its neck. All the first-born of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before Me empty. 21Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest; in plowing time and in harvest thou shalt rest. 22And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, even of the first-fruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the turn of the year. 23Three times in the year shall all thy males appear before the Lord GOD, the God of Israel. 24For I will cast out nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders; neither shall any man covet thy land, when thou goest up to appear before the
<br> 
<br>LORD thy God three times in the year. 25Thou shalt not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning. 26The choicest first-fruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother’s milk.’
<br>27And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘Write thou these words, for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel.’ 28And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten words. 29And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of the testimony in Moses’hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses knew not that the skin of his face sent forth abeams while He talked with him. 30And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face sent forth beams; and they were afraid to come nigh him. 31And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him; and Moses spoke to them. 32And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh, and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount Sinai. 33And when Moses had done speaking with
