<br>(A) suspend liquidation under section 1673b(d)(2) of this title of unliquidated entries of the merchandise made on the later of—
<br>
<br>(i) the date which is 90 days before the date of publication of the notice of suspension of liquidation, or

<br>
<br>(B) if the investigation was not completed, resume the investigation as if its affirmative preliminary determination were made on the date of its determination under this paragraph,
<br>
<br>(C) if the investigation was completed under subsection (g), issue an antidumping duty order under section 1673e(a) of this title effective with respect to entries of merchandise liquidation of which was suspended,

<br>(E) notify the petitioner, interested parties who are or were parties to the investigation, and the Commission of its action under this paragraph.
<br>(2) Intentional violation to be punished by civil penalty
<br>
<br>Any person who intentionally violates an agreement accepted by the administering authority under subsection (b) or (c) shall be subject to a civil penalty assessed in the same amount, in the same manner, and under the same procedures, as the penalty imposed for a fraudulent violation of section 1592(a) of this title.
<br>(j) Determination not to take agreement into account
<br>

<br>(1) Suspension agreements
<br>
<br>If the Commission makes a regional industry determination under section 1677(4)(C) of this title, the administering authority shall offer exporters of the subject merchandise who account for substantially all exports of that merchandise for sale in the region concerned the opportunity to enter into an agreement described in subsection (b), (c), or (l).

<br>§1673d. Final determinations
<br>(a) Final determination by administering authority
<br>(1) General rule
<br>
<br>Within 75 days after the date of its preliminary determination under section 1673b(b) of this title, the administering authority shall make a final determination of whether the subject merchandise is being, or is likely to be, sold in the United States at less than its fair value.
<br>(2) Extension of period for determination
<br>
<br>The administering authority may postpone making the final determination under paragraph (1) until not later than the 135th day after the date on which it published notice of its preliminary determination under section 1673b(b) of this title if a request in writing for such a postponement is made by—
<br>
<br>(A) exporters who account for a significant proportion of exports of the merchandise which is the subject of the investigation, in a proceeding in which the preliminary determination by the administering authority under section 1673b(b) of this title was affirmative, or
<br>
<br>(B) the petitioner, in a proceeding in which the preliminary determination by the administering authority under section 1673b(b) of this title was negative.
<br>(3) Critical circumstances determinations
<br>
<br>If the final determination of the administering authority is affirmative, then that determination, in any investigation in which the presence of critical circumstances has been alleged under section 1673b(e) of this title, shall also contain a finding of whether—
<br>
<br>(A)(i) there is a history of dumping and material injury by reason of dumped imports in the United States or elsewhere of the subject merchandise, or
<br>
<br>(ii) the person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise was imported knew or should have known that the exporter was selling the subject merchandise at less than its fair value and that there would be material injury by reason of such sales, and
<br>
<br>(B) there have been massive imports of the subject merchandise over a relatively short period.
<br>
<br>Such findings may be affirmative even though the preliminary determination under section 1673b(e)(1) of this title was negative.
<br>(4) De minimis dumping margin
<br>
<br>In making a determination under this subsection, the administering authority shall disregard any weighted average dumping margin that is de minimis as defined in section 1673b(b)(3) of this title.
<br>(b) Final determination by Commission
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Commission shall make a final determination of whether—
<br>
<br>(A) an industry in the United States—
<br>
<br>(i) is materially injured, or
<br>
<br>(ii) is threatened with material injury, or
<br>
<br>(B) the establishment of an industry in the United States is materially retarded,
<br>
<br>by reason of imports, or sales (or the likelihood of sales) for importation, of the merchandise with respect to which the administering authority has made an affirmative determination under subsection (a)(1). If the Commission determines that imports of the subject merchandise are negligible, the investigation shall be terminated.
<br>(2) Period for injury determination following affirmative preliminary determination by administering authority
<br>
<br>If the preliminary determination by the administering authority under section 1673b(b) of this title is affirmative, then the Commission shall make the determination required by paragraph (1) before the later of—
<br>
<br>(A) the 120th day after the day on which the administering authority makes its affirmative preliminary determination under section 1673b(b) of this title, or
<br>
<br>(B) the 45th day after the day on which the administering authority makes its affirmative final determination under subsection (a).
<br>(3) Period for injury determination following negative preliminary determination by administering authority
<br>
<br>If the preliminary determination by the administering authority under section 1673b(b) of this title is negative, and its final determination under subsection (a) is affirmative, then the final determination by the Commission under this subsection shall be made within 75 days after the date of that affirmative final determination.
<br>(4) Certain additional findings
<br>
<br>(A) Commission standard for retroactive application.—
<br>
<br>(i) In general.—If the finding of the administering authority under subsection (a)(3) is affirmative, then the final determination of the Commission shall include a finding as to whether the imports subject to the affirmative determination under subsection (a)(3) are likely to undermine seriously the remedial effect of the antidumping duty order to be issued under section 1673e of this title.
<br>
<br>(ii) Factors to consider.—In making the evaluation under clause (i), the Commission shall consider, among other factors it considers relevant—
<br>
<br>(I) the timing and the volume of the imports,
<br>
<br>(II) a rapid increase in inventories of the imports, and
<br>
<br>(III) any other circumstances indicating that the remedial effect of the antidumping order will be seriously undermined.
<br>
<br>(B) If the final determination of the Commission is that there is no material injury but that there is threat of material injury, then its determination shall also include a finding as to whether material injury by reason of the imports of the merchandise with respect to which the administering authority has made an affirmative determination under subsection (a) would have been found but for any suspension of liquidation of entries of the merchandise.
<br>(c) Effect of final determinations
<br>(1) Effect of affirmative determination by the administering authority
<br>
<br>If the determination of the administering authority under subsection (a) is affirmative, then—
<br>
<br>(A) the administering authority shall make available to the Commission all information upon which such determination was based and which the Commission considers relevant to its determination, under such procedures as the administering authority and the Commission may establish to prevent disclosure, other than with the consent of the party providing it or under protective order, of any information as to which confidential treatment has been given by the administering authority,
<br>
<br>(B)(i) the administering authority shall—
<br>
<br>(I) determine the estimated weighted average dumping margin for each exporter and producer individually investigated, and
<br>
<br>(II) determine, in accordance with paragraph (5), the estimated all-others rate for all exporters and producers not individually investigated, and
<br>
<br>(ii) the administering authority shall order the posting of a cash deposit, bond, or other security, as the administering authority deems appropriate, for each entry of the subject merchandise in an amount based on the estimated weighted average dumping margin or the estimated all-others rate, whichever is applicable, and
<br>
<br>(C) in cases where the preliminary determination by the administering authority under section 1673b(b) of this title was negative, the administering authority shall order the suspension of liquidation under section 1673b(d)(2) of this title.
<br>(2) Issuance of order; effect of negative determination
<br>
<br>If the determinations of the administering authority and the Commission under subsections (a)(1) and (b)(1) are affirmative, then the administering authority shall issue an antidumping duty order under section 1673e(a) of this title. If either of such determinations is negative, the investigation shall be terminated upon the publication of notice of that negative determination and the administering authority shall—
<br>
<br>(A) terminate the suspension of liquidation under section 1673b(d)(2) of this title, and
<br>
<br>(B) release any bond or other security, and refund any cash deposit, required under section 1673b(d)(1)(B) of this title.
<br>(3) Effect of negative determinations under subsections (a)(3) and (b)(4)(A)
<br>
<br>If the determination of the administering authority or the Commission under subsection (a)(3) or (b)(4)(A), respectively, is negative, then the administering authority shall—
<br>
<br>(A) terminate any retroactive suspension of liquidation required under paragraph (4) or section 1673b(e)(2) of this title, and
<br>
<br>(B) release any bond or other security, and refund any cash deposit required, under section 1673b(d)(1)(B) of this title with respect to entries of the merchandise the liquidation of which was suspended retroactively under section 1673b(e)(2) of this title.
<br>(4) Effect of affirmative determination under subsection (a)(3)
<br>
<br>If the determination of the administering authority under subsection (a)(3) is affirmative, then the administering authority shall—
<br>
<br>(A) in cases where the preliminary determinations by the administering authority under sections 1673b(b) and 1673b(e)(1) of this title were both affirmative, continue the retroactive suspension of liquidation and the posting of a cash deposit, bond, or other security previously ordered under section 1673b(e)(2) of this title;
<br>
<br>(B) in cases where the preliminary determination by the administering authority under section 1673b(b) of this title was affirmative, but the preliminary determination under section 1673b(e)(1) of this title was negative, shall modify any suspension of liquidation and security requirement previously ordered under section 1673b(d) of this title to apply to unliquidated entries of merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date which is 90 days before the date on which suspension of liquidation was first ordered; or
<br>
<br>(C) in cases where the preliminary determination by the administering authority under section 1673b(b) of this title was negative, shall apply any suspension of liquidation and security requirement ordered under subsection (c)(1)(B) to unliquidated entries of merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date which is 90 days before the date on which suspension of liquidation is first ordered.
<br>(5) Method for determining estimated all-others rate
<br>(A) General rule
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subsection and section 1673b(d) of this title, the estimated all-others rate shall be an amount equal to the weighted average of the estimated weighted average dumping margins established for exporters and producers individually investigated, excluding any zero and de minimis margins, and any margins determined entirely under section 1677e of this title.
<br>(B) Exception
<br>
<br>If the estimated weighted average dumping margins established for all exporters and producers individually investigated are zero or de minimis margins, or are determined entirely under section 1677e of this title, the administering authority may use any reasonable method to establish the estimated all-others rate for exporters and producers not individually investigated, including averaging the estimated weighted average dumping margins determined for the exporters and producers individually investigated.
<br>(d) Publication of notice of determinations
<br>
<br>Whenever the administering authority or the Commission makes a determination under this section, it shall notify the petitioner, other parties to the investigation, and the other agency of its determination and of the facts and conclusions of law upon which the determination is based, and it shall publish notice of its determination in the Federal Register.
<br>(e) Correction of ministerial errors
<br>
<br>The administering authority shall establish procedures for the correction of ministerial errors in final determinations within a reasonable time after the determinations are issued under this section. Such procedures shall ensure opportunity for interested parties to present their views regarding any such errors. As used in this subsection, the term "ministerial error" includes errors in addition, subtraction, or other arithmetic function, clerical errors resulting from inaccurate copying, duplication, or the like, and any other type of unintentional error which the administering authority considers ministerial.

<br>(a) Publication of antidumping duty order
<br>
<br>Within 7 days after being notified by the Commission of an affirmative determination under section 1673d(b) of this title, the administering authority shall publish an antidumping duty order which—
<br>
<br>(1) directs customs officers to assess an antidumping duty equal to the amount by which the normal value of the merchandise exceeds the export price (or the constructed export price) of the merchandise, within 6 months after the date on which the administering authority receives satisfactory information upon which the assessment may be based, but in no event later than—
<br>
<br>(A) 12 months after the end of the annual accounting period of the manufacturer or exporter within which the merchandise is entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption, or
<br>
<br>(B) in the case of merchandise not sold prior to its importation into the United States, 12 months after the end of the annual accounting period of the manufacturer or exporter within which it is sold in the United States to a person who is not the exporter of that merchandise,
<br>
<br>(2) includes a description of the subject merchandise, in such detail as the administering authority deems necessary, and
<br>
<br>(3) requires the deposit of estimated antidumping duties pending liquidation of entries of merchandise at the same time as estimated normal customs duties on that merchandise are deposited.
<br>(b) Imposition of duty
<br>(1) General rule
<br>
<br>If the Commission, in its final determination under section 1673d(b) of this title, finds material injury or threat of material injury which, but for the suspension of liquidation under section 1673b(d)(2) of this title would have led to a finding of material injury, then entries of the subject merchandise, the liquidation of which has been suspended under section 1673b(d)(2) of this title, shall be subject to the imposition of antidumping duties under section 1673 of this title.
<br>(2) Special rule
<br>
<br>If the Commission, in its final determination under section 1673d(b) of this title, finds threat of material injury, other than threat of material injury described in paragraph (1), or material retardation of the establishment of an industry in the United States, then subject merchandise which is entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of notice of an affirmative determination of the Commission under section 1673d(b) of this title shall be subject to the assessment of antidumping duties under section 1673 of this title, and the administering authority shall release any bond or other security, and refund any cash deposit made, to secure the payment of antidumping duties with respect to entries of the merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption before that date.
<br>(c) Security in lieu of estimated duty pending early determination of duty
<br>(1) Conditions for waiver of deposit of estimated duties
<br>
<br>The administering authority may permit, for not more than 90 days after the date of publication of an order under subsection (a), the posting of a bond or other security in lieu of the deposit of estimated antidumping duties required under subsection (a)(3) if—
<br>
<br>(A) the investigation has not been designated as extraordinarily complicated by reason of—
<br>
<br>(i) the number and complexity of the transactions to be investigated or adjustments to be considered,
<br>
<br>(ii) the novelty of the issues presented, or
<br>
<br>(iii) the number of firms whose activities must be investigated,
<br>
<br>(B) the final determination in the investigation has not been postponed under section 1673d(a)(2)(A) of this title;
<br>
<br>(C) on the basis of information presented to the administering authority by any manufacturer, producer, or exporter in such form and within such time as the administering authority may require, the administering authority is satisfied that a determination will be made, within 90 days after the date of publication of an order under subsection (a), of the normal value and the export price (or the constructed export price) for all merchandise of such manufacturer, producer, or exporter described in that order which was entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of—
<br>
<br>(i) an affirmative preliminary determination by the administering authority under section 1673b(b) of this title, or
<br>
<br>(ii) if its determination under section 1673b(b) of this title was negative, an affirmative final determination by the administering authority under section 1673d(a) of this title,
<br>
<br>and before the date of publication of the affirmative final determination by the Commission under section 1673d(b) of this title;
<br>
<br>(D) the party described in subparagraph (C) provides credible evidence that the amount by which the normal value of the merchandise exceeds the export price (or the constructed export price) of the merchandise is significantly less than the amount of such excess specified in the antidumping duty order published under subsection (a); and
<br>
<br>(E) the data concerning the normal value and the export price (or the constructed export price) apply to sales in the usual commercial quantities and in the ordinary course of trade and the number of such sales are sufficient to form an adequate basis for comparison.
<br>(2) Notice; hearing
<br>
<br>If the administering authority permits the posting of a bond or other security in lieu of the deposit of estimated antidumping duties under paragraph (1), it shall—
<br>
<br>(A) publish notice of its action in the Federal Register, and
<br>
<br>(B) upon the request of any interested party, hold a hearing in accordance with section 1677c of this title before determining the normal value and the export price (or the constructed export price) of the merchandise.
<br>(3) Determinations to be basis of antidumping duty
<br>
<br>The administering authority shall publish notice in the Federal Register of the results of its determination of normal value and export price (or the constructed export price), and that determination shall be the basis for the assessment of antidumping duties on entries of merchandise to which the notice under this subsection applies and also shall be the basis for the deposit of estimated antidumping duties on future entries of merchandise of manufacturers, producers, or exporters described in paragraph (1) to which the order issued under subsection (a) applies.
<br>(4) Provision of business proprietary information; written comments
<br>
<br>Before determining whether to permit the posting of bond or other security under paragraph (1) in lieu of the deposit of estimated antidumping duties, the administering authority shall—
<br>
<br>(A) make all business proprietary information supplied to the administering authority under paragraph (1) available under a protective order in accordance with section 1677f(c) of this title to all interested parties described in subparagraph (C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) of section 1677(9) of this title, and
<br>
<br>(B) afford all interested parties an opportunity to file written comments on whether the posting of bond or other security under paragraph (1) in lieu of the deposit of estimated antidumping duties should be permitted.
<br>(d) Special rule for regional industries
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>In an investigation in which the Commission makes a regional industry determination under section 1677(4)(C) of this title, the administering authority shall, to the maximum extent possible, direct that duties be assessed only on the subject merchandise of the specific exporters or producers that exported the subject merchandise for sale in the region concerned during the period of investigation.
<br>(2) Exception for new exporters and producers
<br>
<br>After publication of the antidumping duty order, if the administering authority finds that a new exporter or producer is exporting the subject merchandise for sale in the region concerned, the administering authority shall direct that duties be assessed on the subject merchandise of the new exporter or producer consistent with the provisions of section 1675(a)(2)(B) of this title.

<br>
<br>(i) identify the short life cycle merchandise that is the subject of the affirmative dumping determinations,

<br>(B) upon receipt of such confirmation, determine whether the merchandise covered by the confirmed affirmative determinations is short life cycle merchandise and whether the petitioner is an eligible domestic entity.
<br>(3) Notice; hearings
<br>
<br>If the determinations under paragraph (2)(B) are affirmative, the Commission shall—
<br>
<br>(A) publish notice in the Federal Register that the petition has been received, and

<br>
<br>The term "affirmative dumping determination" means—
<br>
<br>(A) any affirmative final determination made by the administering authority under section 1673d(a) of this title during the 8-year period preceding the filing of the petition under this section that results in the issuance of an antidumping duty order under section 1673e of this title which requires the deposit of estimated antidumping duties at a rate of not less than 15 percent ad valorem, or

<br>
<br>(i) such merchandise of the manufacturer is part of a group of merchandise to which the administering authority assigns (in lieu of making separate determinations described in subparagraph (A)(i)(I)) an amount determined to be the amount by which the normal value of the merchandise in such group exceeds the export price (or the constructed export price) of the merchandise in such group, and
<br>
<br>(ii) the merchandise and the manufacturer are not specified by name in the affirmative dumping determination or in any antidumping duty order issued as a result of such affirmative dumping determination.
<br>(4) Short life cycle merchandise
<br>
<br>The term "short life cycle merchandise" means any product that the Commission determines is likely to become outmoded within 4 years, by reason of technological advances, after the product is commercially available. For purposes of this paragraph, the term "outmoded" refers to a kind of style that is no longer state-of-the-art.
<br>(c) Transitional rules
<br>
<br>(1) For purposes of this section and section 1673b(b)(1)(B) and (C) of this title, all affirmative dumping determinations described in subsection (b)(2)(A) that were made after December 31, 1980, and before August 23, 1988, and all affirmative dumping determinations described in subsection (b)(2)(B) that were made after December 31, 1984, and before August 23, 1988, with respect to each category of short life cycle merchandise of the same manufacturer shall be treated as one affirmative dumping determination with respect to that category for that manufacturer which was made on the date on which the latest of such determinations was made.
<br>
<br>(2) No affirmative dumping determination that—
<br>
<br>(A) is described in subsection (b)(2)(A) and was made before January 1, 1981, or
<br>
<br>(B) is described in subsection (b)(2)(B) and was made before January 1, 1985,
<br>
<br>may be taken into account under this section or section 1673b(b)(1)(B) and (C) of this title.

<br>Part III—Reviews; Other Actions Regarding Agreements
<br>Codification
<br>
<br>The designation "Part III" was in the original "Subtitle C" and was editorially changed in order to conform the numbering format of this subtitle to the usages employed in the codification of the remainder of the Tariff Act of 1930 as originally enacted.
<br>subpart a—review of amount of duty and agreements other than quantitative restriction agreements
<br>§1675. Administrative review of determinations
<br>(a) Periodic review of amount of duty
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>At least once during each 12-month period beginning on the anniversary of the date of publication of a countervailing duty order under this subtitle or under section 1303 1 of this title, an antidumping duty order under this subtitle or a finding under the Antidumping Act, 1921, or a notice of the suspension of an investigation, the administering authority, if a request for such a review has been received and after publication of notice of such review in the Federal Register, shall—
<br>
<br>(A) review and determine the amount of any net countervailable subsidy,
<br>
<br>(B) review, and determine (in accordance with paragraph (2)), the amount of any antidumping duty, and
<br>
<br>(C) review the current status of, and compliance with, any agreement by reason of which an investigation was suspended, and review the amount of any net countervailable subsidy or dumping margin involved in the agreement,
<br>
<br>and shall publish in the Federal Register the results of such review, together with notice of any duty to be assessed, estimated duty to be deposited, or investigation to be resumed.
<br>(2) Determination of antidumping duties
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>For the purpose of paragraph (1)(B), the administering authority shall determine—
<br>
<br>(i) the normal value and export price (or constructed export price) of each entry of the subject merchandise, and
<br>
<br>(ii) the dumping margin for each such entry.
<br>(B) Determination of antidumping or countervailing duties for new exporters and producers
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>If the administering authority receives a request from an exporter or producer of the subject merchandise establishing that—
<br>
<br>(I) such exporter or producer did not export the merchandise that was the subject of an antidumping duty or countervailing duty order to the United States (or, in the case of a regional industry, did not export the subject merchandise for sale in the region concerned) during the period of investigation, and
<br>
<br>(II) such exporter or producer is not affiliated (within the meaning of section 1677(33) of this title) with any exporter or producer who exported the subject merchandise to the United States (or in the case of a regional industry, who exported the subject merchandise for sale in the region concerned) during that period,
<br>
<br> the administering authority shall conduct a review under this subsection to establish an individual weighted average dumping margin or an individual countervailing duty rate (as the case may be) for such exporter or producer.
<br>(ii) Time for review under clause (i)
<br>
<br>The administering authority shall commence a review under clause (i) in the calendar month beginning after—
<br>
<br>(I) the end of the 6-month period beginning on the date of the countervailing duty or antidumping duty order under review, or
<br>
<br>(II) the end of any 6-month period occurring thereafter,
<br>
<br> if the request for the review is made during that 6-month period.
<br>(iii) Time limits
<br>
<br>The administering authority shall make a preliminary determination in a review conducted under this subparagraph within 180 days after the date on which the review is initiated, and a final determination within 90 days after the date the preliminary determination is issued, except that if the administering authority concludes that the case is extraordinarily complicated, it may extend the 180-day period to 300 days and may extend the 90-day period to 150 days.
<br>(iv) Determinations based on bona fide sales
<br>
<br>Any weighted average dumping margin or individual countervailing duty rate determined for an exporter or producer in a review conducted under clause (i) shall be based solely on the bona fide United States sales of an exporter or producer, as the case may be, made during the period covered by the review. In determining whether the United States sales of an exporter or producer made during the period covered by the review were bona fide, the administering authority shall consider, depending on the circumstances surrounding such sales—
<br>
<br>(I) the prices of such sales;
<br>
<br>(II) whether such sales were made in commercial quantities;
<br>
<br>(III) the timing of such sales;
<br>
<br>(IV) the expenses arising from such sales;
<br>
<br>(V) whether the subject merchandise involved in such sales was resold in the United States at a profit;
<br>
<br>(VI) whether such sales were made on an arms-length basis; and
<br>
<br>(VII) any other factor the administering authority determines to be relevant as to whether such sales are, or are not, likely to be typical of those the exporter or producer will make after completion of the review.
<br>(C) Results of determinations
<br>
<br>The determination under this paragraph shall be the basis for the assessment of countervailing or antidumping duties on entries of merchandise covered by the determination and for deposits of estimated duties.
<br>(3) Time limits
<br>(A) Preliminary and final determinations
<br>
<br>The administering authority shall make a preliminary determination under subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of paragraph (1) within 245 days after the last day of the month in which occurs the anniversary of the date of publication of the order, finding, or suspension agreement for which the review under paragraph (1) is requested, and a final determination under paragraph (1) within 120 days after the date on which the preliminary determination is published. If it is not practicable to complete the review within the foregoing time, the administering authority may extend that 245-day period to 365 days and may extend that 120-day period to 180 days. The administering authority may extend the time for making a final determination without extending the time for making a preliminary determination, if such final determination is made not later than 300 days after the date on which the preliminary determination is published.
<br>(B) Liquidation of entries
<br>
<br>If the administering authority orders any liquidation of entries pursuant to a review under paragraph (1), such liquidation shall be made promptly and, to the greatest extent practicable, within 90 days after the instructions to Customs are issued. In any case in which liquidation has not occurred within that 90-day period, the Secretary of the Treasury shall, upon the request of the affected party, provide an explanation thereof.
<br>(C) Effect of pending review under section 1516a
<br>
<br>In a case in which a final determination under paragraph (1) is under review under section 1516a of this title and a liquidation of entries covered by the determination is enjoined under section 1516a(c)(2) of this title or suspended under section 1516a(g)(5)(C) of this title, the administering authority shall, within 10 days after the final disposition of the review under section 1516a of this title, transmit to the Federal Register for publication the final disposition and issue instructions to the Customs Service with respect to the liquidation of entries pursuant to the review. In such a case, the 90-day period referred to in subparagraph (B) shall begin on the day on which the administering authority issues such instructions.
<br>(4) Absorption of antidumping duties
<br>
<br>During any review under this subsection initiated 2 years or 4 years after the publication of an antidumping duty order under section 1673e(a) of this title, the administering authority, if requested, shall determine whether antidumping duties have been absorbed by a foreign producer or exporter subject to the order if the subject merchandise is sold in the United States through an importer who is affiliated with such foreign producer or exporter. The administering authority shall notify the Commission of its findings regarding such duty absorption for the Commission to consider in conducting a review under subsection (c).
<br>(b) Reviews based on changed circumstances
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Whenever the administering authority or the Commission receives information concerning, or a request from an interested party for a review of—
<br>
<br>(A) a final affirmative determination that resulted in an antidumping duty order under this subtitle or a finding under the Antidumping Act, 1921, or in a countervailing duty order under this subtitle or section 1303 1 of this title,
<br>
<br>(B) a suspension agreement accepted under section 1671c or 1673c of this title, or
<br>
<br>(C) a final affirmative determination resulting from an investigation continued pursuant to section 1671c(g) or 1673c(g) of this title,
<br>
<br>which shows changed circumstances sufficient to warrant a review of such determination or agreement, the administering authority or the Commission (as the case may be) shall conduct a review of the determination or agreement after publishing notice of the review in the Federal Register.
<br>(2) Commission review
<br>
<br>In conducting a review under this subsection, the Commission shall—
<br>
<br>(A) in the case of a countervailing duty order or antidumping duty order or finding, determine whether revocation of the order or finding is likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury,
<br>
<br>(B) in the case of a determination made pursuant to section 1671c(h)(2) or 1673c(h)(2) of this title, determine whether the suspension agreement continues to eliminate completely the injurious effects of imports of the subject merchandise, and
<br>
<br>(C) in the case of an affirmative determination resulting from an investigation continued under section 1671c(g) or 1673c(g) of this title, determine whether termination of the suspended investigation is likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury.
<br>(3) Burden of persuasion
<br>
<br>During a review conducted by the Commission under this subsection—
<br>
<br>(A) the party seeking revocation of an order or finding described in paragraph (1)(A) shall have the burden of persuasion with respect to whether there are changed circumstances sufficient to warrant such revocation, and
<br>
<br>(B) the party seeking termination of a suspended investigation or a suspension agreement shall have the burden of persuasion with respect to whether there are changed circumstances sufficient to warrant such termination.
<br>(4) Limitation on period for review
<br>
<br>In the absence of good cause shown—
<br>
<br>(A) the Commission may not review a determination made under section 1671d(b) or 1673d(b) of this title, or an investigation suspended under section 1671c or 1673c of this title, and
<br>
<br>(B) the administering authority may not review a determination made under section 1671d(a) or 1673d(a) of this title, or an investigation suspended under section 1671c or 1673c of this title,
<br>
<br>less than 24 months after the date of publication of notice of that determination or suspension.
<br>(c) Five-year review
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding subsection (b) and except in the case of a transition order defined in paragraph (6), 5 years after the date of publication of—
<br>
<br>(A) a countervailing duty order (other than a countervailing duty order to which subparagraph (B) applies or which was issued without an affirmative determination of injury by the Commission under section 1303 1 of this title), an antidumping duty order, or a notice of suspension of an investigation, described in subsection (a)(1),
<br>
<br>(B) a notice of injury determination under section 1675b of this title with respect to a countervailing duty order, or
<br>
<br>(C) a determination under this section to continue an order or suspension agreement,
<br>
<br>the administering authority and the Commission shall conduct a review to determine, in accordance with section 1675a of this title, whether revocation of the countervailing or antidumping duty order or termination of the investigation suspended under section 1671c or 1673c of this title would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of dumping or a countervailable subsidy (as the case may be) and of material injury.
<br>(2) Notice of initiation of review
<br>
<br>Not later than 30 days before the fifth anniversary of the date described in paragraph (1), the administering authority shall publish in the Federal Register a notice of initiation of a review under this subsection and request that interested parties submit—
<br>
<br>(A) a statement expressing their willingness to participate in the review by providing information requested by the administering authority and the Commission,
<br>
<br>(B) a statement regarding the likely effects of revocation of the order or termination of the suspended investigation, and
<br>
<br>(C) such other information or industry data as the administering authority or the Commission may specify.
<br>(3) Responses to notice of initiation
<br>(A) No response
<br>
<br>If no interested party responds to the notice of initiation under this subsection, the administering authority shall issue a final determination, within 90 days after the initiation of a review, revoking the order or terminating the suspended investigation to which such notice relates. For purposes of this paragraph, an interested party means a party described in section 1677(9)(C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) of this title.
<br>(B) Inadequate response
<br>
<br>If interested parties provide inadequate responses to a notice of initiation, the administering authority, within 120 days after the initiation of the review, or the Commission, within 150 days after such initiation, may issue, without further investigation, a final determination based on the facts available, in accordance with section 1677e of this title.
<br>(4) Waiver of participation by certain interested parties
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>An interested party described in section 1677(9)(A) or (B) of this title may elect not to participate in a review conducted by the administering authority under this subsection and to participate only in the review conducted by the Commission under this subsection.
<br>(B) Effect of waiver
<br>
<br>In a review in which an interested party waives its participation pursuant to this paragraph, the administering authority shall conclude that revocation of the order or termination of the investigation would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of dumping or a countervailable subsidy (as the case may be) with respect to that interested party.
<br>(5) Conduct of review
<br>(A) Time limits for completion of review
<br>
<br>Unless the review has been completed pursuant to paragraph (3) or paragraph (4) applies, the administering authority shall make its final determination pursuant to section 1675a(b) or (c) of this title within 240 days after the date on which a review is initiated under this subsection. If the administering authority makes a final affirmative determination, the Commission shall make its final determination pursuant to section 1675a(a) of this title within 360 days after the date on which a review is initiated under this subsection.
<br>(B) Extension of time limit
<br>
<br>The administering authority or the Commission (as the case may be) may extend the period of time for making their respective determinations under this subsection by not more than 90 days, if the administering authority or the Commission (as the case may be) determines that the review is extraordinarily complicated. In a review in which the administering authority extends the time for making a final determination, but the Commission does not extend the time for making a determination, the Commission's determination shall be made not later than 120 days after the date on which the final determination of the administering authority is published.
<br>(C) Extraordinarily complicated
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subsection, the administering authority or the Commission (as the case may be) may treat a review as extraordinarily complicated if—
<br>
<br>(i) there is a large number of issues,
<br>
<br>(ii) the issues to be considered are complex,
<br>
<br>(iii) there is a large number of firms involved,
<br>
<br>(iv) the orders or suspended investigations have been grouped as described in subparagraph (D), or
<br>
<br>(v) it is a review of a transition order.
<br>(D) Grouped reviews
<br>
<br>The Commission, in consultation with the administering authority, may group orders or suspended investigations for review if it considers that such grouping is appropriate and will promote administrative efficiency. Where orders or suspended investigations have been grouped, the Commission shall, subject to subparagraph (B), make its final determination under this subsection not later than 120 days after the date that the administering authority publishes notice of its final determination with respect to the last order or agreement in the group.
<br>(6) Special transition rules
<br>(A) Schedule for reviews of transition orders
<br>(i) Initiation
<br>
<br>The administering authority shall begin its review of transition orders in the 42d calendar month after the date such orders are issued. A review of all transition orders shall be initiated not later than the 5th anniversary after the date such orders are issued.
<br>(ii) Completion
<br>
<br>A review of a transition order shall be completed not later than 18 months after the date such review is initiated. Reviews of all transition orders shall be completed not later than 18 months after the 5th anniversary of the date such orders are issued.
<br>(iii) Subsequent reviews
<br>
<br>The time limits set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) shall be applied to all subsequent 5-year reviews of transition orders by substituting "date of the determination to continue such orders" for "date such orders are issued".
<br>(iv) Revocation and termination
<br>
<br>No transition order may be revoked under this subsection before the date that is 5 years after the date the WTO Agreement enters into force with respect to the United States.
<br>(B) Sequence of transition reviews
<br>
<br>The administering authority, in consultation with the Commission, shall determine such sequence of review of transition orders as it deems appropriate to promote administrative efficiency. To the extent practicable, older orders shall be reviewed first.
<br>(C) "Transition order" defined
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, the term "transition order" means—
<br>
<br>(i) a countervailing duty order under this subtitle or under section 1303 1 of this title,
<br>
<br>(ii) an antidumping duty order under this subtitle or a finding under the Antidumping Act, 1921, or
<br>
<br>(iii) a suspension of an investigation under section 1671c or 1673c of this title,
<br>
<br>which is in effect on the date the WTO Agreement enters into force with respect to the United States.
<br>(D) Issue date for transition orders
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subsection, a transition order shall be treated as issued on the date the WTO Agreement enters into force with respect to the United States, if such order is based on an investigation conducted by both the administering authority and the Commission.
<br>(7) Exclusions from computations
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Subject to subparagraph (B), there shall be excluded from the computation of the 5-year period described in paragraph (1) and the periods described in paragraph (6) any period during which the importation of the subject merchandise is prohibited on account of the imposition, under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act [50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.] or other provision of law, of sanctions by the United States against the country in which the subject merchandise originates.
<br>(B) Application of exclusion
<br>
<br>Subparagraph (A) shall apply only with respect to subject merchandise which originates in a country that is not a WTO member.
<br>(d) Revocation of order or finding; termination of suspended investigation
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The administering authority may revoke, in whole or in part, a countervailing duty order or an antidumping duty order or finding, or terminate a suspended investigation, after review under subsection (a) or (b). The administering authority shall not revoke, in whole or in part, a countervailing duty order or terminate a suspended investigation on the basis of any export taxes, duties, or other charges levied on the export of the subject merchandise to the United States which are specifically intended to offset the countervailable subsidy received.
<br>(2) Five-year reviews
<br>
<br>In the case of a review conducted under subsection (c), the administering authority shall revoke a countervailing duty order or an antidumping duty order or finding, or terminate a suspended investigation, unless—
<br>
<br>(A) the administering authority makes a determination that dumping or a countervailable subsidy, as the case may be, would be likely to continue or recur, and
<br>
<br>(B) the Commission makes a determination that material injury would be likely to continue or recur as described in section 1675a(a) of this title.
<br>(3) Application of revocation or termination
<br>
<br>A determination under this section to revoke an order or finding or terminate a suspended investigation shall apply with respect to unliquidated entries of the subject merchandise which are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date determined by the administering authority.
<br>(e) Hearings
<br>
<br>Whenever the administering authority or the Commission conducts a review under this section, it shall, upon the request of an interested party, hold a hearing in accordance with section 1677c(b) of this title in connection with that review.
<br>(f) Determination that basis for suspension no longer exists
<br>
<br>If the determination of the Commission under subsection (b)(2)(B) is negative, the suspension agreement shall be treated as not accepted, beginning on the date of publication of the Commission's determination, and the administering authority and the Commission shall proceed, under section 1671c(i) or 1673c(i) of this title, as if the suspension agreement had been violated on that date, except that no duty under any order subsequently issued shall be assessed on merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption before that date.
<br>(g) Reviews to implement results of subsidies enforcement proceeding
<br>(1) Violations of article 8 of the subsidies agreement
<br>
<br>If—
<br>
<br>(A) the administering authority receives notice from the Trade Representative of a violation of Article 8 of the Subsidies Agreement,
<br>
<br>(B) the administering authority has reason to believe that merchandise subject to an existing countervailing duty order or suspended investigation is benefiting from the subsidy or subsidy program found to have been in violation of Article 8 of the Subsidies Agreement, and
<br>
<br>(C) no review pursuant to subsection (a)(1) is in progress,
<br>
<br>the administering authority shall conduct a review of the order or suspended investigation to determine whether the subject merchandise benefits from the subsidy or subsidy program found to have been in violation of Article 8 of the Subsidies Agreement. If the administering authority determines that the subject merchandise is benefiting from the subsidy or subsidy program, it shall make appropriate adjustments in the estimated duty to be deposited or appropriate revisions to the terms of the suspension agreement.
<br>(2) Withdrawal of subsidy or imposition of countermeasures
<br>
<br>If the Trade Representative notifies the administering authority that, pursuant to Article 4 or Article 7 of the Subsidies Agreement—
<br>
<br>(A)(i) the United States has imposed countermeasures, and
<br>
<br>(ii) such countermeasures are based on the effects in the United States of imports of merchandise that is the subject of a countervailing duty order, or
<br>
<br>(B) a WTO member country has withdrawn a countervailable subsidy provided with respect to merchandise subject to a countervailing duty order,
<br>
<br>the administering authority shall conduct a review to determine if the amount of the estimated duty to be deposited should be adjusted or the order should be revoked.
<br>(3) Expedited review
<br>
<br>The administering authority shall conduct reviews under this subsection on an expedited basis, and shall publish the results of such reviews in the Federal Register.
<br>(h) Correction of ministerial errors
<br>
<br>The administering authority shall establish procedures for the correction of ministerial errors in final determinations within a reasonable time after the determinations are issued under this section. Such procedures shall ensure opportunity for interested parties to present their views regarding any such errors. As used in this subsection, the term "ministerial error" includes errors in addition, subtraction, or other arithmetic function, clerical errors resulting from inaccurate copying, duplication, or the like, and any other type of unintentional error which the administering authority considers ministerial.

<br>§1675a. Special rules for section 1675(b) and 1675(c) reviews
<br>(a) Determination of likelihood of continuation or recurrence of material injury
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>In a review conducted under section 1675(b) or (c) of this title, the Commission shall determine whether revocation of an order, or termination of a suspended investigation, would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury within a reasonably foreseeable time. The Commission shall consider the likely volume, price effect, and impact of imports of the subject merchandise on the industry if the order is revoked or the suspended investigation is terminated. The Commission shall take into account—
<br>
<br>(A) its prior injury determinations, including the volume, price effect, and impact of imports of the subject merchandise on the industry before the order was issued or the suspension agreement was accepted,
<br>
<br>(B) whether any improvement in the state of the industry is related to the order or the suspension agreement,
<br>
<br>(C) whether the industry is vulnerable to material injury if the order is revoked or the suspension agreement is terminated, and
<br>
<br>(D) in an antidumping proceeding under section 1675(c) of this title, the findings of the administering authority regarding duty absorption under section 1675(a)(4) of this title.
<br>(2) Volume
<br>
<br>In evaluating the likely volume of imports of the subject merchandise if the order is revoked or the suspended investigation is terminated, the Commission shall consider whether the likely volume of imports of the subject merchandise would be significant if the order is revoked or the suspended investigation is terminated, either in absolute terms or relative to production or consumption in the United States. In so doing, the Commission shall consider all relevant economic factors, including—
<br>
<br>(A) any likely increase in production capacity or existing unused production capacity in the exporting country,
<br>
<br>(B) existing inventories of the subject merchandise, or likely increases in inventories,
<br>
<br>(C) the existence of barriers to the importation of such merchandise into countries other than the United States, and
<br>
<br>(D) the potential for product-shifting if production facilities in the foreign country, which can be used to produce the subject merchandise, are currently being used to produce other products.
<br>(3) Price
<br>
<br>In evaluating the likely price effects of imports of the subject merchandise if the order is revoked or the suspended investigation is terminated, the Commission shall consider whether—
<br>
<br>(A) there is likely to be significant price underselling by imports of the subject merchandise as compared to domestic like products, and
<br>
<br>(B) imports of the subject merchandise are likely to enter the United States at prices that otherwise would have a significant depressing or suppressing effect on the price of domestic like products.
<br>(4) Impact on the industry
<br>
<br>In evaluating the likely impact of imports of the subject merchandise on the industry if the order is revoked or the suspended investigation is terminated, the Commission shall consider all relevant economic factors which are likely to have a bearing on the state of the industry in the United States, including, but not limited to—
<br>
<br>(A) likely declines in output, sales, market share, profits, productivity, return on investments, and utilization of capacity,
<br>
<br>(B) likely negative effects on cash flow, inventories, employment, wages, growth, ability to raise capital, and investment, and
<br>
<br>(C) likely negative effects on the existing development and production efforts of the industry, including efforts to develop a derivative or more advanced version of the domestic like product.
<br>
<br>The Commission shall evaluate all relevant economic factors described in this paragraph within the context of the business cycle and the conditions of competition that are distinctive to the affected industry.
<br>(5) Basis for determination
<br>
<br>The presence or absence of any factor which the Commission is required to consider under this subsection shall not necessarily give decisive guidance with respect to the Commission's determination of whether material injury is likely to continue or recur within a reasonably foreseeable time if the order is revoked or the suspended investigation is terminated. In making that determination, the Commission shall consider that the effects of revocation or termination may not be imminent, but may manifest themselves only over a longer period of time.
<br>(6) Magnitude of margin of dumping and net countervailable subsidy; nature of countervailable subsidy
<br>
<br>In making a determination under section 1675(b) or (c) of this title, the Commission may consider the magnitude of the margin of dumping or the magnitude of the net countervailable subsidy. If a countervailable subsidy is involved the Commission shall consider information regarding the nature of the countervailable subsidy and whether the subsidy is a subsidy described in Article 3 or 6.1 of the Subsidies Agreement.
<br>(7) Cumulation
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subsection, the Commission may cumulatively assess the volume and effect of imports of the subject merchandise from all countries with respect to which reviews under section 1675(b) or (c) of this title were initiated on the same day, if such imports would be likely to compete with each other and with domestic like products in the United States market. The Commission shall not cumulatively assess the volume and effects of imports of the subject merchandise in a case in which it determines that such imports are likely to have no discernible adverse impact on the domestic industry.
<br>(8) Special rule for regional industries
<br>
<br>In a review under section 1675(b) or (c) of this title involving a regional industry, the Commission may base its determination on the regional industry defined in the original investigation under this subtitle, another region that satisfies the criteria established in section 1677(4)(C) of this title, or the United States as a whole. In determining if a regional industry analysis is appropriate for the determination in the review, the Commission shall consider whether the criteria established in section 1677(4)(C) of this title are likely to be satisfied if the order is revoked or the suspended investigation is terminated.
<br>(b) Determination of likelihood of continuation or recurrence of a countervailable subsidy
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>In a review conducted under section 1675(c) of this title, the administering authority shall determine whether revocation of a countervailing duty order or termination of a suspended investigation under section 1671c of this title would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of a countervailable subsidy. The administering authority shall consider—
<br>
<br>(A) the net countervailable subsidy determined in the investigation and subsequent reviews, and
<br>
<br>(B) whether any change in the program which gave rise to the net countervailable subsidy described in subparagraph (A) has occurred that is likely to affect that net countervailable subsidy.
<br>(2) Consideration of other factors
<br>
<br>If good cause is shown, the administering authority shall also consider—
<br>
<br>(A) programs determined to provide countervailable subsidies in other investigations or reviews under this subtitle, but only to the extent that such programs—
<br>
<br>(i) can potentially be used by the exporters or producers subject to the review under section 1675(c) of this title, and
<br>
<br>(ii) did not exist at the time that the countervailing duty order was issued or the suspension agreement was accepted, and
<br>
<br>(B) programs newly alleged to provide countervailable subsidies but only to the extent that the administering authority makes an affirmative countervailing duty determination with respect to such programs and with respect to the exporters or producers subject to the review.
<br>(3) Net countervailable subsidy
<br>
<br>The administering authority shall provide to the Commission the net countervailable subsidy that is likely to prevail if the order is revoked or the suspended investigation is terminated. The administering authority shall normally choose a net countervailable subsidy that was determined under section 1671d of this title or subsection (a) or (b)(1) of section 1675 of this title.
<br>(4) Special rule
<br>(A) Treatment of zero and de minimis rates
<br>
<br>A net countervailable subsidy described in paragraph (1)(A) that is zero or de minimis shall not by itself require the administering authority to determine that revocation of a countervailing duty order or termination of a suspended investigation would not be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of a countervailable subsidy.
<br>(B) Application of de minimis standards
<br>
<br>For purposes of this paragraph, the administering authority shall apply the de minimis standards applicable to reviews conducted under subsections (a) and (b)(1) of section 1675 of this title.
<br>(c) Determination of likelihood of continuation or recurrence of dumping
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>In a review conducted under section 1675(c) of this title, the administering authority shall determine whether revocation of an antidumping duty order or termination of a suspended investigation under section 1673c of this title would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of sales of the subject merchandise at less than fair value. The administering authority shall consider—
<br>
<br>(A) the weighted average dumping margins determined in the investigation and subsequent reviews, and
<br>
<br>(B) the volume of imports of the subject merchandise for the period before and the period after the issuance of the antidumping duty order or acceptance of the suspension agreement.
<br>(2) Consideration of other factors
<br>
<br>If good cause is shown, the administering authority shall also consider such other price, cost, market, or economic factors as it deems relevant.
<br>(3) Magnitude of the margin of dumping
<br>
<br>The administering authority shall provide to the Commission the magnitude of the margin of dumping that is likely to prevail if the order is revoked or the suspended investigation is terminated. The administering authority shall normally choose a margin that was determined under section 1673d of this title or under subsection (a) or (b)(1) of section 1675 of this title.
<br>(4) Special rule
<br>(A) Treatment of zero or de minimis margins
<br>
<br>A dumping margin described in paragraph (1)(A) that is zero or de minimis shall not by itself require the administering authority to determine that revocation of an antidumping duty order or termination of a suspended investigation would not be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of sales at less than fair value.
<br>(B) Application of de minimis standards
<br>
<br>For purposes of this paragraph, the administering authority shall apply the de minimis standards applicable to reviews conducted under subsections (a) and (b) of section 1675 of this title.
<br>
<br>(June 17, 1930, ch. 497, title VII, §752, as added Pub. L. 103–465, title II, §221(a), Dec. 8, 1994, 108 Stat. 4865.)
<br>Effective Date
<br>
<br>Section effective, except as otherwise provided, on the date on which the WTO Agreement enters into force with respect to the United States (Jan. 1, 1995), and applicable with respect to investigations, reviews, and inquiries initiated and petitions filed under specified provisions of this chapter after such date, see section 291 of Pub. L. 103–465, set out as an Effective Date of 1994 Amendment note under section 1671 of this title.
<br>§1675b. Special rules for injury investigations for certain section 1303 or section 1671(c) countervailing duty orders and investigations
<br>(a) In general
<br>(1) Investigation by the commission upon request
<br>
<br>In the case of a countervailing duty order described in paragraph (2), which—
<br>
<br>(A) applies to merchandise that is the product of a Subsidies Agreement country, and
<br>
<br>(B)(i) is in effect on the date on which such country becomes a Subsidies Agreement country, or
<br>
<br>(ii) is issued on a date that is after the date described in clause (i) pursuant to a court order in an action brought under section 1516a of this title,
<br>
<br>the Commission, upon receipt of a request from an interested party described in section 1677(9)(C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) of this title for an injury investigation with respect to such order, shall initiate an investigation and shall determine whether an industry in the United States is likely to be materially injured by reason of imports of the subject merchandise if the order is revoked.
