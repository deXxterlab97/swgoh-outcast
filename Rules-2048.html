<br>Vegetable Ink Printing
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 103–348, Oct. 6, 1994, 108 Stat. 3133, as amended by Pub. L. 113–235, div. H, title I, §1301(b), (d), Dec. 16, 2014, 128 Stat. 2537, provided that:
<br>"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
<br>
<br>"This Act may be cited as the 'Vegetable Ink Printing Act of 1994'."
<br>"SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.
<br>
<br>"(a) Findings.—The Congress finds the following:
<br>
<br>"(1) More than 95 percent of Federal printing involving documents or publications is performed using lithographic inks.
<br>
<br>"(2) Various types of oil, including petroleum and vegetable oil, are used in lithographic ink.
<br>
<br>"(3) Increasing the amount of vegetable oil used in a lithographic ink would—
<br>
<br>"(A) help reduce the Nation's use of nonrenewable energy resources;
<br>
<br>"(B) result in the use of products that are less damaging to the environment;
<br>
<br>"(C) result in a reduction of volatile organic compound emissions; and
<br>
<br>"(D) increase the use of renewable agricultural products.
<br>
<br>"(4) The technology exists to use vegetable oil in lithographic ink and, in some applications, to use lithographic ink that uses no petroleum distillates in the liquid portion of the ink.
<br>
<br>"(5) Some lithographic inks have contained vegetable oils for many years; other lithographic inks have more recently begun to use vegetable oil.
<br>
<br>"(6) According to the Government Publishing Office, using vegetable oil-based ink appears to add little if any additional cost to Government printing.
<br>
<br>"(7) Use of vegetable oil-based ink in Federal Government printing should further develop—
<br>
<br>"(A) the commercial viability of vegetable oil-based ink, which could result in demand, for domestic use alone, for 2,500,000,000 pounds of vegetable crops or 500,000,000 pounds of vegetable oil; and
<br>
<br>"(B) a product that could help the United States retain or enlarge its share of the world market for vegetable oil-ink.
<br>
<br>"(b) Purpose.—The purpose of this Act is to require that all lithographic printing using ink containing oil that is performed or procured by a Federal agency shall use ink containing the maximum amounts of vegetable oil and materials derived from other renewable resources that—
<br>
<br>"(1) are technologically feasible, and
<br>
<br>"(2) result in printing costs that are competitive with printing using petroleum-based inks.
<br>"SEC. 3. FEDERAL PRINTING REQUIREMENTS.
<br>
<br>"(a) General Rule.—Notwithstanding any other law, and except as provided in subsection (b), a Federal agency may not perform or procure lithographic printing that uses ink containing oil if the ink contains less than the following percentage of vegetable oil:
<br>
<br>"(1) In the case of news ink, 40 percent.
<br>
<br>"(2) In the case of sheet-fed ink, 20 percent.
<br>
<br>"(3) In the case of forms ink, 20 percent.
<br>
<br>"(4) In the case of heat-set ink, 10 percent.
<br>
<br>"(b) Exceptions.—
<br>
<br>"(1) Exceptions.—Subsection (a) shall not apply to lithographic printing performed or procured by a Federal agency, if—
<br>
<br>"(A) the head of the agency determines, after consultation with the Director of the Government Publishing Office and within the 3-year period ending on the date of the commencement of the printing or the date of that procurement, respectively, that vegetable oil-based ink is not suitable to meet specific, identified requirements of the agency related to the printing; or
<br>
<br>"(B) the Director of the Government Publishing Office determines—
<br>
<br>"(i) within the 3-month period ending on the date of the commencement of the printing, in the case of printing of materials that are printed at intervals of less than 6 months, or
<br>
<br>"(ii) before the date of the commencement of the printing, in the case of printing of materials that are printed at intervals of 6 months or more;
<br>
<br>  that the cost of performing the printing using vegetable oil-based ink is significantly greater than the cost of performing the printing using other available ink.
<br>
<br>"(2) Notice to congress.—Not later than 30 days after making a determination under paragraph (1)(A), the head of a Federal agency shall report the determination to the Committee on Government Operations [now Committee on Oversight and Reform] and the Committee on House Administration of the House of Representatives, and the Committee on Rules of the Senate.
<br>
<br>"(c) Federal Agency Defined.—In this Act, the term 'Federal agency' means—
<br>
<br>"(1) an executive department, military department, Government corporation, Government-controlled corporation, or other establishment in the executive branch of the Government (including the Executive Office of the President), or any independent regulatory agency; and
<br>
<br>"(2) an establishment or component of the legislative or judicial branch of the Government."

<br>"Whereas paper manufacturers can produce a sufficient supply of acid free permanent papers with a life of several hundred years, at prices competitive with acid papers, if publishers would specify the use of such papers, and some publishers and many university presses are already publishing on acid free permanent papers;
<br>
<br>"Whereas most Government agencies do not require the use of acid free permanent papers for appropriate Federal records and publications;
<br>
<br>"Whereas librarians, publishers, and other professional groups have urged the use of acid free permanent papers;
<br>
<br>"Whereas even when books are printed on acid free permanent paper this fact is often not made known to libraries by notations in the book or by notations in standard bibliographic listings; and
<br>
<br>"Whereas there is an urgent need to prevent the continuance of the acid paper problem in the future: Now, therefore, be it
<br>
<br>"Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,
<br>
<br>"Section 1. It is the policy of the United States that Federal records, books, and publications of enduring value be produced on acid free permanent papers.
<br>
<br>"Sec. 2. The Congress of the United States urgently recommends that—
<br>
<br>"(1) Federal agencies require the use of acid free permanent papers for publications of enduring value produced by the Government Publishing Office or produced by Federal grant or contract, using the specifications for such paper established by the Joint Committee on Printing;
<br>
<br>"(2) Federal agencies require the use of archival quality acid free papers for permanently valuable Federal records and confer with the National Archives and Records Administration on the requirements for paper quality;
<br>
<br>"(3) American publishers and State and local governments use acid free permanent papers for publications of enduring value, in voluntary compliance with the American National Standard;
<br>
<br>"(4) all publishers, private and governmental, prominently note the use of acid free permanent paper in books, advertisements, catalogs, and standard bibliographic listings; and
<br>
<br>"(5) the Secretary of State, Librarian of Congress, Archivist of the United States, and other Federal officials make known the national policy regarding acid free permanent papers to foreign governments and appropriate international agencies since the acid paper problem is worldwide and essential foreign materials being imported by our libraries are printed on acid papers.
<br>
<br>"Sec. 3. The Librarian of Congress, the Archivist of the United States, and the Director of the Government Publishing Office shall jointly monitor the Federal Government's progress in implementing the national policy declared in section 1 regarding acid free permanent papers and shall report to the Congress regarding such progress on December 31, 1991, December 31, 1993, and December 31, 1995. In carrying out the monitoring and reporting functions under this section, the Librarian of Congress, the Archivist of the United States, and the Director of the Government Publishing Office may consult with the National Endowment for the Humanities, National Agricultural Library, National Library of Medicine, other Federal and State agencies, international organizations, private publishers, paper manufacturers, and other organizations with an interest in preservation of books and historical papers."
<br>§510. Specifications in advertisements for paper
<br>
<br>The advertisements for proposals shall specify the minimum portion of each quality of paper required for either three months, six months, or one year, as the Joint Committee on Printing determines; but when the minimum portion so specified exceeds, in any case, one thousand reams, it shall state that proposals will be received for one thousand reams or more.

<br>Authority and responsibilities under chapter not limited or repealed by Federal Records Management Amendments of 1976, see section 5(b) of Pub. L. 94–575, set out as a note under section 2901 of this title.
<br>§701. "Usual number" of documents and reports; distribution of House and Senate documents and reports; binding; reports on private bills; number of copies printed; distribution
<br>
<br>(a) The order by either House of Congress to print a document or report shall signify the "usual number" of copies for binding and distribution among those entitled to receive them. A greater number may not be printed unless ordered by either House, or as provided by this section. When a special number of a document or report is ordered printed, the usual number shall also be printed, unless already ordered.
<br>
<br>(b) The "usual number" of documents and reports shall be one thousand six hundred and eighty-two copies, which shall be printed at one time and distributed as follows:
<br>
<br>Of the House documents and reports, unbound—to the Senate document room, one hundred and fifty copies; to the office of the Secretary of the Senate, ten copies; to the House document room, not to exceed five hundred copies; to the office of the Clerk of the House of Representatives, twenty copies; to the Library of Congress, ten copies, as provided by section 1718 of this title.
<br>
<br>Of the Senate documents and reports, unbound—to the Senate document room, two hundred and twenty copies; office of the Secretary of the Senate, ten copies; to the House document room, not to exceed five hundred copies; to the Clerk's office of the House of Representatives, ten copies; to the Library of Congress, ten copies, as provided by section 1718 of this title.
<br>
<br>(c) Of the number printed, the Director of the Government Publishing Office shall bind a sufficient number of copies for distribution as follows:
<br>
<br>Of the House documents and reports, bound—to the Senate library, fifteen copies; to the Library of Congress, not to exceed one hundred and fifty copies, as provided by section 1718 of this title; to the House of Representatives library, fifteen copies; to the Superintendent of Documents, as many copies as are required for distribution to the State libraries and designated depositories.
<br>
<br>Of the Senate documents and reports, bound—to the Senate library, fifteen copies; to the Library of Congress, copies as provided by sections 1718 and 1719 of this title; to the House of Representatives library, fifteen copies; to the Superintendent of Documents, as many copies as may be required for distribution to State libraries and designated depositories. In binding documents the Director of the Government Publishing Office shall give precedence to those that are to be distributed to libraries and to designated depositories. But a State library or designated depository entitled to documents that may prefer to have its documents in unbound form, may do so by notifying the Superintendent of Documents to that effect prior to the convening of each Congress.
<br>
<br>(d) The usual number of reports on private bills, concurrent or simple resolutions, may not be printed. Instead there shall be printed of each Senate report on a private bill, simple or concurrent resolution, in addition to those required to be furnished the Library of Congress, three hundred and forty-five copies, which shall be distributed as follows: to the Senate document room, two hundred and twenty copies; to the Secretary of the Senate, fifteen copies; to the House document room, one hundred copies; to the Superintendent of Documents, ten copies; and of each House report on a private bill, simple or concurrent resolution, in addition to those for the Library of Congress, two hundred and sixty copies, which shall be distributed as follows: to the Senate document room, one hundred and thirty-five copies; to the Secretary of the Senate, fifteen copies; to the House document room, one hundred copies; to the Superintendent of Documents, ten copies.
<br>
<br>This section does not prevent the binding of all Senate and House reports in the reserve volumes bound for and delivered to the Senate and House libraries, nor abridge the right of the Vice President, Senators, Representatives, Resident Commissioner, Secretary of the Senate, and Clerk of the House to have bound in half morocco, or material not more expensive, one copy of every public document to which he may be entitled. At least twelve copies of each report on bills for the payment or adjudication of claims against the Government shall be kept on file in the Senate document room.
