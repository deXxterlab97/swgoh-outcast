<br>
<br>The economic and financial structure of this country in combination with the Nation's natural resources and the productivity of the American people has produced one of the highest average standards of living in the world. However, the Nation has been experiencing inflation and unemployment together with an increasing gap between producers' prices and consumers' purchasing power. This has resulted in a growing number of our citizens, especially the elderly, the poor, and the inner city resident, being unable to share in the fruits of our Nation's highly efficient economic system. The Congress finds that user-owned cooperatives are a proven method for broadening ownership and control of the economic organizations, increasing the number of market participants, narrowing price spreads, raising the quality of goods and services available to their membership, and building bridges between producers and consumers, and their members and patrons. The Congress also finds that consumer and other types of self-help cooperatives have been hampered in their formation and growth by lack of access to adequate cooperative credit facilities and lack of technical assistance. Therefore, the Congress finds a need for the establishment of a National Consumer Cooperative Bank which will make available necessary financial and technical assistance to cooperative self-help endeavors as a means of strengthening the Nation's economy.

Such additional stock ownership requirements may be on the basis of the face amount of the loan, the outstanding balances, or on a percentage of interest payable during any year or any quarter thereof, as the Bank may determine will provide adequate capital for the operation of the Bank and equitable ownership thereof among borrowers.
<br>(e) Class C stock; purchase, dividends, etc.
<br>
<br>Class C stock shall be available for purchase and shall be held only by borrowers or by organizations eligible to borrow under section 3015 of this title or by organizations controlled by such borrowers, and shall be entitled to dividends in the manner specified in the bylaws of the Bank.

<br>
<br>1 So in original. Probably should be "have".
<br>§3015. Eligibility of cooperatives
<br>(a) General requirements
<br>
<br>For the purpose of all subchapters of this chapter, subject to the limitations of subsection (d) of this section, an eligible cooperative is an organization chartered or operated on a cooperative, not-for-profit basis for producing or furnishing goods, services or facilities, primarily for the benefit of its members or voting stockholders who are ultimate consumers of such goods, services, or facilities, or a legally chartered entity primarily owned and controlled by any such organization or organizations, if it—
<br>
<br>(1) makes such goods, services or facilities directly or indirectly available to its members or voting stockholders on a not-for-profit basis;
<br>
<br>(2) does not pay dividends on voting stock or membership capital in excess of such percentage per annum as may be approved under the bylaws of the Bank;
<br>
<br>(3) provides that its net savings shall be allocated or distributed to all members or patrons, in proportion to their patronage, or shall be retained for the actual or potential expansion of its services or the reduction of its charges to the patrons, or for such other purposes as may be authorized by its membership not inconsistent with its purposes;
<br>
<br>(4) makes membership available on a voluntary basis, without any social, political, racial, or religious discrimination and without any discrimination on the basis of age, sex, or marital status, to all persons who can make use of its services and are willing to accept the responsibilities of membership, subject only to limitations under applicable Federal or State laws or regulations;
<br>
<br>(5) in the case of primary cooperative organizations restricts its voting control to members or voting stockholders on a one vote per person basis (except that this requirement shall not apply to any housing cooperative in existence on March 21, 1980, which did not meet such requirement on such date) and takes positive steps to insure economic democracy and maximum participation by members of the cooperative including the holding of annual meetings and, in the case of organizations owned by groups of cooperatives, provides positive protections to insure economic democracy; and
<br>
<br>(6) is not a credit union, mutual savings bank, or mutual savings and loan association.
<br>(b) Primary producers
<br>
<br>No organization shall be ineligible because it produces, markets, or furnishes goods, services, or facilities on behalf of its members as primary producers, unless the dollar volume of loans made by the Bank to such organizations exceeds 10 per centum of the gross assets of the Bank.
<br>(c) "Net savings" defined
<br>
<br>As used in this section, the term "net savings" means, for any period, the borrower's gross receipts, less the operating and other expenses deductible therefrom in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, including, without limitation, contributions to allowable reserves, and after deducting the amounts of any dividends on its capital stock or other membership capital payable during, or within forty-five days after, the close of such period.
<br>(d) Cooperatives eligible for other Federal credit assistance
<br>
<br>An eligible cooperative which also has been determined to be eligible for credit assistance from the Rural Electrification Administration, the National Rural Utilities Cooperative Finance Corporation, the Banks for Cooperatives or other institutions of the Farm Credit System, or the Farmers Home Administration may receive the assistance authorized by this chapter only (1) if the Bank determines that a request for assistance from any such source or sources has been rejected or denied solely because of the unavailability of funds from such source or sources, or (2) by agreement between the Bank and the agency or agencies involved.
<br>(e) Credit unions eligible for technical assistance from Office of Self-Help Development and Technical Assistance
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a credit union serving predominantly low-income members (as defined by the Administrator of the National Credit Union Administration) may receive technical assistance under subchapter II.

<br>§3018. Loans
<br>(a) General requirements for loans and commitments for loans; limitations; allocation of assistance for low-income persons; criteria and factors for making loans, etc.; publication
<br>
<br>The Bank may make loans and commitments for loans under this subsection to any organization determined by the Bank to be eligible under the provisions of section 3015 of this title, and may purchase or discount obligations of members of such organizations if the Bank, to the exclusion of all other persons, entities, agencies, or jurisdictions, also determines that the applicant has or will have a sound organizational and financial structure, income in excess of its operating costs and assets in excess of its obligations, and a reasonable expectation of a continuing demand for its production, goods, commodities, or services, or the use of its facilities, so that the loan will be fully repayable in accordance with its terms and conditions. Commencing on October 1, 1985, the Bank shall not make any loan to a cooperative for the purpose of financing the construction, ownership, acquisition, or improvement of any structure used primarily for residential purposes if, after giving effect to such loan, the aggregate amount of all loans outstanding for such purpose would exceed 30 per centum of the gross assets of the Bank. The Board of Directors shall use its best efforts to insure that at the end of each fiscal year of the Bank at least 35 per centum of its outstanding loans are to—
<br>
<br>(1) cooperatives at least a majority of the members of which are low-income persons, and
<br>
<br>(2) other cooperatives, if the proceeds of such loans are directly applied to finance a facility, activity, or service that the Board finds will be used predominantly by low-income persons.
<br>
<br>The Board shall adopt and publish in the Federal Register rules defining the term "low-income persons" for purposes of this subsection. The criteria to be applied and the factors to be considered by the Bank in making loans, loan commitments, purchases, discounts, and guarantees shall include an assessment of the impact of the loan on existing small businesses in the eligible organizations' business territory. The criteria and factors shall be stated in rules of the Bank which shall be published and made available to applicants and, upon request, to any other person or organization.
<br>(b) Repayment requirements; criteria for terms, rates, and charges; advancement of loan proceeds
<br>
<br>Loans under this section shall be repayable in not more than forty years and, except for loans with final due date not longer than five years from the date of the loan, shall be amortized as to principal and interest. In setting the terms, rates, and charges, it shall be the objective of the Bank to provide the type of credit needed by eligible borrowers, at the lowest reasonable cost on a sound business basis, taking into account the cost of money to the Bank, necessary reserve and expenses of the Bank, and the technical and other assistance attributable to loans under this section made available by the Bank. The loan terms may provide for interest rates to vary from time to time during the repayment period of the loan in accordance with the rates being charged by the Bank for new loans at such times. The proceeds of a loan under this subsection may be advanced by the borrower to its members or stockholders under circumstances described in the bylaws or rules of the Bank.
<br>(c) Guarantees by Bank; requirements; charges
<br>
<br>Subject to section 3012(13) of this title, the Bank may guarantee all or any part of the principal and interest of any loan made by any State or federally chartered lending institution to any borrower if such loan is to an organization that would be an eligible borrower from the Bank for a direct loan and is on terms and conditions (including the rate of interest) which would be permissible terms and conditions for such a direct loan. The Bank may impose a charge for any such guarantee. No loan may be guaranteed by the Bank if the income therefrom to the lender is excluded from such lender's gross income for purposes of chapter 1 of title 26.
<br>(d) Assignment of guaranteed loans; contestability of guarantee; criteria for purchase by Bank of guaranteed loan in lieu of requiring service by lender
<br>
<br>Any loan guaranteed under subsection (c) shall be assignable to the extent provided in the contract of guarantee as may be determined by the Bank. The guarantee shall be uncontestable, except for fraud or misrepresentation of which the holder had actual knowledge at the time he acquired the loan. The Bank in lieu of requiring such lender to service such guaranteed loan until final maturity or liquidation, may purchase the loan for the balance of the principal and accrued interest thereon without penalty, if it determines that (1) the liquidation of the loan would result in the insolvency of the borrower or deprive the borrower of assets essential to its continued operation, and (2) the loan will be repayable with revision of the loan rates, terms, or payment periods or other conditions not inconsistent with loans made by the Bank under subsection (a) of this section, which revisions the lender or other holder of such guaranteed loan is unwilling to make.
<br>(e) Aggregate amount of commitments to make or guarantee loans
<br>
<br>As long as any of the class A stock of the Bank is held by the Secretary of the Treasury, the aggregate amount of commitments by the Bank to make or guarantee loans shall not exceed such amounts as may be specified in annual appropriation Acts.

<br>

<br>
<br>"Sec. 901. For purposes of this title enacting this provision—

<br>
<br>1 So in original. The comma probably should follow the quotation marks.
<br>§3102. Establishment of Federal branches and agencies by foreign bank
<br>(a) Establishment and operation of Federal branches and agencies
<br>(1) Initial Federal branch or agency
<br>
<br>Except as provided in section 3103 of this title, a foreign bank which engages directly in a banking business outside the United States may, with the approval of the Comptroller, establish one or more Federal branches or agencies in any State in which (1) it is not operating a branch or agency pursuant to State law and (2) the establishment of a branch or agency, as the case may be, by a foreign bank is not prohibited by State law.
<br>(2) Board conditions required to be included
<br>
<br>In considering any application for approval under this subsection, the Comptroller of the Currency shall include any condition imposed by the Board under section 3105(d)(5) of this title as a condition for the approval of such application by the agency.
<br>(b) Rules and regulations; rights and privileges; duties and liabilities; exceptions; coordination of examinations
<br>
<br>In establishing and operating a Federal branch or agency, a foreign bank shall be subject to such rules, regulations, and orders as the Comptroller considers appropriate to carry out this section, which shall include provisions for service of process and maintenance of branch and agency accounts separate from those of the parent bank. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter or in rules, regulations, or orders adopted by the Comptroller under this section, operations of a foreign bank at a Federal branch or agency shall be conducted with the same rights and privileges as a national bank at the same location and shall be subject to all the same duties, restrictions, penalties, liabilities, conditions, and limitations that would apply under the National Bank Act to a national bank doing business at the same location, except that (1) any limitation or restriction based on the capital stock and surplus of a national bank shall be deemed to refer, as applied to a Federal branch or agency, to the dollar equivalent of the capital stock and surplus of the foreign bank, and if the foreign bank has more than one Federal branch or agency the business transacted by all such branches and agencies shall be aggregated in determining compliance with the limitation; (2) a Federal branch or agency shall not be required to become a member bank, as that term is defined in section 221 of this title; and (3) a Federal agency shall not be required to become an insured bank as that term is defined in section 1813(h) of this title. The Comptroller of the Currency shall coordinate examinations of Federal branches and agencies of foreign banks with examinations conducted by the Board under section 3105(c)(1) of this title and, to the extent possible, shall participate in any simultaneous examinations of the United States operations of a foreign bank requested by the Board under such section.
<br>(c) Application to establish Federal branch or agency; matters considered
<br>
<br>In acting on any application to establish a Federal branch or agency, the Comptroller shall take into account the effects of the proposal on competition in the domestic and foreign commerce of the United States, the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the applicant foreign bank and the branch or agency, and the convenience and needs of the community to be served.
<br>(d) Receipt of deposits and exercising of fiduciary powers at Federal agency prohibited
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a foreign bank shall not receive deposits or exercise fiduciary powers at any Federal agency. A foreign bank may, however, maintain at a Federal agency for the account of others credit balances incidental to, or arising out of, the exercise of its lawful powers.
<br>(e) Maintenance of Federal branch and Federal agency in same State prohibited
<br>
<br>No foreign bank may maintain both a Federal branch and a Federal agency in the same State.
<br>(f) Conversion of foreign bank branch, agency or commercial lending company into Federal branch or agency; approval of Comptroller
<br>
<br>Any branch or agency operated by a foreign bank in a State pursuant to State law and any commercial lending company controlled by a foreign bank may be converted into a Federal branch or agency with the approval of the Comptroller. In the event of any conversion pursuant to this subsection, all of the liabilities of such foreign bank previously payable at the State branch or agency, or all of the liabilities of the commercial lending company, shall thereafter be payable by such foreign bank at the branch or agency established under this subsection.
<br>(g) Deposit requirements; asset requirements
<br>
<br>(1) Upon the opening of a Federal branch or agency in any State and thereafter, a foreign bank, in addition to any deposit requirements imposed under section 3104 of this title, shall keep on deposit, in accordance with such rules and regulations as the Comptroller may prescribe, with a member bank designated by such foreign bank, dollar deposits or investment securities of the type that may be held by national banks for their own accounts pursuant to paragraph "Seventh" of section 24 of this title, in an amount as hereinafter set forth. Such depository bank shall be located in the State where such branch or agency is located and shall be approved by the Comptroller if it is a national bank and by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System if it is a State Bank.
<br>
<br>(2) The aggregate amount of deposited investment securities (calculated on the basis of principal amount or market value, whichever is lower) and dollar deposits for each branch or agency established and operating under this section shall be not less than the greater of (1) that amount of capital (but not surplus) which would be required of a national bank being organized at this location, or (2) 5 per centum of the total liabilities of such branch or agency, including acceptances, but excluding (A) accrued expenses, and (B) amounts due and other liabilities to offices, branches, agencies, and subsidiaries of such foreign bank. The Comptroller may require that the assets deposited pursuant to this subsection shall be maintained in such amounts as he may from time to time deem necessary or desirable, for the maintenance of a sound financial condition, the protection of depositors, and the public interest, but such additional amount shall in no event be greater than would be required to conform to generally accepted banking practices as manifested by banks in the area in which the branch or agency is located.
<br>
<br>(3) The deposit shall be maintained with any such member bank pursuant to a deposit agreement in such form and containing such limitations and conditions as the Comptroller may prescribe. So long as it continues business in the ordinary course such foreign bank shall, however, be permitted to collect income on the securities and funds so deposited and from time to time examine and exchange such securities.
<br>
<br>(4) Subject to such conditions and requirements as may be prescribed by the Comptroller, each foreign bank shall hold in each State in which it has a Federal branch or agency, assets of such types and in such amount as the Comptroller may prescribe by general or specific regulation or ruling as necessary or desirable for the maintenance of a sound financial condition, the protection of depositors, creditors and the public interest. In determining compliance with any such prescribed asset requirements, the Comptroller shall give credit to (A) assets required to be maintained pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, (B) reserves required to be maintained pursuant to section 3105(a) of this title, and (C) assets pledged, and surety bonds payable, to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to secure the payment of domestic deposits. The Comptroller may prescribe different asset requirements for branches or agencies in different States, in order to ensure competitive equality of Federal branches and agencies with State branches and agencies and domestic banks in those States.
<br>(h) Additional branches or agencies
<br>(1) Approval of agency required
<br>
<br>A foreign bank with a Federal branch or agency operating in any State may (A) with the prior approval of the Comptroller establish and operate additional branches or agencies in the State in which such branch or agency is located on the same terms and conditions and subject to the same limitations and restrictions as are applicable to the establishment of branches by a national bank if the principal office of such national bank were located at the same place as the initial branch or agency in such State of such foreign bank and (B) change the designation of its initial branch or agency to any other branch or agency subject to the same limitations and restrictions as are applicable to a change in the designation of the principal office of a national bank if such principal office were located at the same place as such initial branch or agency.
<br>(2) Notice to and comment by Board
<br>
<br>The Comptroller of the Currency shall provide the Board with notice and an opportunity for comment on any application to establish an additional Federal branch or Federal agency under this subsection.
<br>(i) Termination of authority to operate Federal branch or agency
<br>
<br>Authority to operate a Federal branch or agency shall terminate when the parent foreign bank voluntarily relinquishes it or when such parent foreign bank is dissolved or its authority or existence is otherwise terminated or canceled in the country of its organization. If (1) at any time the Comptroller is of the opinion or has reasonable cause to believe that such foreign bank has violated or failed to comply with any of the provisions of this section or any of the rules, regulations, or orders of the Comptroller made pursuant to this section, or (2) a conservator is appointed for such foreign bank or a similar proceeding is initiated in the foreign bank's country of organization, the Comptroller shall have the power, after opportunity for hearing, to revoke the foreign bank's authority to operate a Federal branch or agency. The Comptroller may, in his discretion, deny such opportunity for hearing if he determines such denial to be in the public interest. The Comptroller may restore any such authority upon due proof of compliance with the provisions of this section and the rules, regulations, or orders of the Comptroller made pursuant to this section.
<br>(j) Receivership over assets of foreign bank in United States
<br>
<br>(1) Whenever the Comptroller revokes a foreign bank's authority to operate a Federal branch or agency or whenever any creditor of any such foreign bank shall have obtained a judgment against it arising out of a transaction with a Federal branch or agency in any court of record of the United States or any State of the United States and made application, accompanied by a certificate from the clerk of the court stating that such judgment has been rendered and has remained unpaid for the space of thirty days, or whenever the Comptroller shall become satisfied that such foreign bank is insolvent, he may, after due consideration of its affairs, in any such case, appoint a receiver who shall take possession of all the property and assets of such foreign bank in the United States and exercise the same rights, privileges, powers, and authority with respect thereto as are now exercised by receivers of national banks appointed by the Comptroller.
<br>
<br>(2) In any receivership proceeding ordered pursuant to this subsection (j), whenever there has been paid to each and every depositor and creditor of such foreign bank whose claim or claims shall have been proved or allowed, the full amount of such claims arising out of transactions had by them with any branch or agency of such foreign bank located in any State of the United States, except (A) claims that would not represent an enforceable legal obligation against such branch or agency if such branch or agency were a separate legal entity, and (B) amounts due and other liabilities to other offices or branches or agencies of, and wholly owned (except for a nominal number of directors' shares) subsidiaries of, such foreign bank, and all expenses of the receivership, the Comptroller or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, where that Corporation has been appointed receiver of the foreign bank, shall turn over the remainder, if any, of the assets and proceeds of such foreign bank to the head office of such foreign bank, or to the duly appointed domiciliary liquidator or receiver of such foreign bank.

<br>§3103. Interstate banking by foreign banks
<br>(a) Interstate branching and agency operations
<br>(1) Federal branch or agency
<br>
<br>Subject to the provisions of this chapter and with the prior written approval by the Board and the Comptroller of the Currency of an application, a foreign bank may establish and operate a Federal branch or agency in any State outside the home State of such foreign bank to the extent that the establishment and operation of such branch would be permitted under section 36(g) of this title or section 1831u of this title if the foreign bank were a national bank whose home State is the same State as the home State of the foreign bank.
<br>(2) State branch or agency
<br>
<br>Subject to the provisions of this chapter and with the prior written approval by the Board and the appropriate State bank supervisor of an application, a foreign bank may establish and operate a State branch or agency in any State outside the home State of such foreign bank to the extent that such establishment and operation would be permitted under section 1828(d)(4) or 1831u of this title if the foreign bank were a State bank whose home State is the same State as the home State of the foreign bank.
<br>(3) Criteria for determination
<br>
<br>In approving an application under paragraph (1) or (2), the Board and (in the case of an application under paragraph (1)) the Comptroller of the Currency—
<br>
<br>(A) shall apply the standards applicable to the establishment of a foreign bank office in the United States under section 3105(d) of this title;
<br>
<br>(B) may not approve an application unless the Board and (in the case of an application under paragraph (1)) the Comptroller of the Currency—
<br>
<br>(i) determine that the foreign bank's financial resources, including the capital level of the bank, are equivalent to those required for a domestic bank to be approved for branching under section 36 of this title and section 1831u of this title; and
<br>
<br>(ii) consult with the Secretary of the Treasury regarding capital equivalency; and
<br>
<br>(C) shall apply the same requirements and conditions to which an application for an interstate merger transaction is subject under paragraphs (1), (3), and (4) of section 1831u(b) of this title.
<br>(4) Operation
<br>
<br>Subsections (c) and (d)(2) of section 1831u of this title shall apply with respect to each branch and agency of a foreign bank which is established and operated pursuant to an application approved under this subsection in the same manner and to the same extent such provisions of such section apply to a domestic branch of a national or State bank (as such terms are defined in section 1813 of this title) which resulted from a merger transaction under such section 1831u of this title.
<br>(5) Exclusive authority for additional branches
<br>
<br>Except as provided in this section, a foreign bank may not, directly or indirectly, acquire, establish, or operate a branch or agency in any State other than the home State of such bank.
<br>(6) Requirement for a separate subsidiary
<br>
<br>If the Board or the Comptroller of the Currency, taking into account differing regulatory or accounting standards, finds that adherence by a foreign bank to capital requirements equivalent to those imposed under section 36 of this title and section 1831u of this title could be verified only if the banking activities of such bank in the United States are carried out in a domestic banking subsidiary within the United States, the Board and (in the case of an application under paragraph (1)) the Comptroller of the Currency may approve an application under paragraph (1) or (2) subject to a requirement that the foreign bank or company controlling the foreign bank establish a domestic banking subsidiary in the United States.
<br>(7) Additional authority for interstate branches and agencies of foreign banks, upgrades of certain foreign bank agencies and branches
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2), a foreign bank may—
<br>
<br>(A) with the approval of the Board and the Comptroller of the Currency, establish and operate a Federal branch or Federal agency or, with the approval of the Board and the appropriate State bank supervisor, a State branch or State agency in any State outside the foreign bank's home State if—
<br>
<br>(i) the establishment and operation of such branch or agency is permitted by the State in which the branch or agency is to be established; and
<br>
<br>(ii) in the case of a Federal or State branch, the branch receives only such deposits as would be permitted for a corporation organized under section 25A of the Federal Reserve Act [12 U.S.C. 611 et seq.]; or
<br>
<br>(B) with the approval of the Board and the relevant licensing authority (the Comptroller in the case of a Federal branch or the appropriate State supervisor in the case of a State branch), upgrade an agency, or a branch of the type referred to in subparagraph (A)(ii), located in a State outside the foreign bank's home State, into a Federal or State branch if—
<br>
<br>(i) the establishment and operation of such branch is permitted by such State; and
<br>
<br>(ii) such agency or branch—
<br>
<br>(I) was in operation in such State on the day before September 29, 1994; or
<br>
<br>(II) has been in operation in such State for a period of time that meets the State's minimum age requirement permitted under section 1831u(a)(5) of this title.
<br>(8) Continuing requirement for meeting community credit needs after initial interstate entry by acquisition
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>If a foreign bank acquires a bank or a branch of a bank, in a State in which the foreign bank does not maintain a branch, and such acquired bank is, or is part of, a regulated financial institution (as defined in section 803 of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 [12 U.S.C. 2902]), the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 [12 U.S.C. 2901 et seq.] shall continue to apply to each branch of the foreign bank which results from the acquisition as if such branch were a regulated financial institution.
<br>(B) Exception for branch that receives only deposits permissible for an Edge Act corporation
<br>
<br>Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any branch that receives only such deposits as are permissible for a corporation organized under section 25A of the Federal Reserve Act [12 U.S.C. 611 et seq.] to receive.
<br>(9) Home State of domestic bank defined
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subsection, the term "home State" means—
<br>
<br>(A) with respect to a national bank, the State in which the main office of the bank is located; and
<br>
<br>(B) with respect to a State bank, the State by which the bank is chartered.
<br>(b) Continuance of lawful interstate banking operations previously commenced
<br>
<br>Unless its authority to do so is lawfully revoked otherwise than pursuant to this section, a foreign bank, notwithstanding any restriction or limitation imposed under subsection (a) of this section, may establish and operate, outside its home State, any State branch, State agency, or bank or commercial lending company subsidiary which commenced lawful operation or for which an application to commence business had been lawfully filed with the appropriate State or Federal authority, as the case may be, on or before July 27, 1978. Notwithstanding subsection (a), a foreign bank may continue to operate, after September 29, 1994, any Federal branch, State branch, Federal agency, State agency, or commercial lending company subsidiary which such bank was operating on the day before September 29, 1994, to the extent the branch, agency, or subsidiary continues, after September 29, 1994, to engage in operations which were lawful under the laws in effect on the day before September 29, 1994.
<br>(c) Determination of home State of foreign bank
<br>
<br>For the purposes of this section—
<br>
<br>(1) in the case of a foreign bank that has any branch, agency, subsidiary commercial lending company, or subsidiary bank in more than 1 State, the home State of the foreign bank is the 1 State of such States which is selected to be the home State by the foreign bank or, in default of any such selection, by the Board; and
<br>
<br>(2) in the case of a foreign bank that does not have a branch, agency, subsidiary commercial lending company, or subsidiary bank in more than 1 State, the home State of the foreign bank is the State in which the foreign bank has a branch, agency, subsidiary commercial lending company, or subsidiary bank.
<br>(d) Clarification of branching rules in case of foreign bank with domestic bank subsidiary
<br>
<br>In the case of a foreign bank that has a domestic bank subsidiary within the United States—
<br>
<br>(1) the fact that such bank controls a domestic bank shall not affect the authority of the foreign bank to establish Federal and State branches or agencies to the extent permitted under subsection (a); and
<br>
<br>(2) the fact that the domestic bank is controlled by a foreign bank which has Federal or State branches or agencies in States other than the home State of such domestic bank shall not affect the authority of the domestic bank to establish branches outside the home State of the domestic bank to the extent permitted under section 36(g) of this title or section 1828(d)(4) or 1831u of this title, as the case may be.

<br>§3104. Insurance of deposits
<br>(a) Objective
<br>
<br>In implementing this section, the Comptroller and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation shall each, by affording equal competitive opportunities to foreign and United States banking organizations in their United States operations, ensure that foreign banking organizations do not receive an unfair competitive advantage over United States banking organizations.
<br>(b) Deposits of less than amount equal to the standard maximum deposit insurance amount
<br>
<br>No foreign bank may establish or operate a Federal branch which receives deposits of less than an amount equal to the standard maximum deposit insurance amount unless the branch is an insured branch as defined in section 3(s) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act [12 U.S.C. 1813(s)], or unless the Comptroller determines by order or regulation that the branch is not engaged in domestic retail deposit activities requiring deposit insurance protection, taking account of the size and nature of depositors and deposit accounts.
<br>(c) Deposits required to be insured under State law
<br>
<br>(1) After September 17, 1978, no foreign bank may establish a branch, and after one year following such date no foreign bank may operate a branch, in any State in which the deposits of a bank organized and existing under the laws of that State would be required to be insured, unless the branch is an insured branch as defined in section 3(s) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act [12 U.S.C. 1813(s)], or unless the branch will not thereafter accept deposits of less than an amount equal to the standard maximum deposit insurance amount, or unless the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation determines by order or regulation that the branch is not engaged in domestic retail deposit activities requiring deposit insurance protection, taking account of the size and nature of depositors and deposit accounts.
<br>
<br>(2) Notwithstanding the previous paragraph, a branch of a foreign bank in operation on September 17, 1978, which has applied for Federal deposit insurance pursuant to section 5 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act [12 U.S.C. 1815] by September 17, 1979, and has not had such application denied, may continue to accept domestic retail deposits until January 31, 1980.
<br>(d) Retail deposit-taking by foreign banks
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>After December 19, 1991, notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter or any provision of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act [12 U.S.C. 1811 et seq.], in order to accept or maintain domestic retail deposit accounts having balances of less than an amount equal to the standard maximum deposit insurance amount, and requiring deposit insurance protection, a foreign bank shall—
<br>
<br>(A) establish 1 or more banking subsidiaries in the United States for that purpose; and
<br>
<br>(B) obtain Federal deposit insurance for any such subsidiary in accordance with the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.
