<br>SUBCHAPTER II—INFORMATION SECURITY
<br>§3551. Purposes
<br>
<br>The purposes of this subchapter are to—
<br>
<br>(1) provide a comprehensive framework for ensuring the effectiveness of information security controls over information resources that support Federal operations and assets;
<br>
<br>(2) recognize the highly networked nature of the current Federal computing environment and provide effective governmentwide management and oversight of the related information security risks, including coordination of information security efforts throughout the civilian, national security, and law enforcement communities;
<br>
<br>(3) provide for development and maintenance of minimum controls required to protect Federal information and information systems;
<br>
<br>(4) provide a mechanism for improved oversight of Federal agency information security programs, including through automated security tools to continuously diagnose and improve security;
<br>
<br>(5) acknowledge that commercially developed information security products offer advanced, dynamic, robust, and effective information security solutions, reflecting market solutions for the protection of critical information infrastructures important to the national defense and economic security of the nation that are designed, built, and operated by the private sector; and
<br>
<br>(6) recognize that the selection of specific technical hardware and software information security solutions should be left to individual agencies from among commercially developed products.

<br>Part B—Confidential Information Protection
<br>§3571. Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds the following:
<br>
<br>(1) Individuals, businesses, and other organizations have varying degrees of legal protection when providing information to the agencies for strictly statistical purposes.
<br>
<br>(2) Pledges of confidentiality by agencies provide assurances to the public that information about individuals or organizations or provided by individuals or organizations for exclusively statistical purposes will be held in confidence and will not be used against such individuals or organizations in any agency action.
<br>
<br>(3) Protecting the confidentiality interests of individuals or organizations who provide information under a pledge of confidentiality for Federal statistical programs serves both the interests of the public and the needs of society.
<br>
<br>(4) Declining trust of the public in the protection of information provided under a pledge of confidentiality to the agencies adversely affects both the accuracy and completeness of statistical analyses.
<br>
<br>(5) Ensuring that information provided under a pledge of confidentiality for statistical purposes receives protection is essential in continuing public cooperation in statistical programs.
