<br>§2943. Leasing and hiring of quarters; rental of inadequate housing
<br>
<br>(a) The Secretary is authorized to lease housing facilities at or near Coast Guard installations, wherever located, for assignment as public quarters to military personnel and their dependents, if any, without rental charge upon a determination by the Secretary, or his designee, that there is a lack of adequate housing facilities at or near such Coast Guard installations. The Secretary is also authorized to lease housing facilities for assignment as public quarters, without rental charge, to military personnel who are on sea duty or duty at remote offshore Coast Guard stations and who do not have dependents. Such authority shall be effective in any fiscal year only to such extent or in such amounts as are provided in appropriation Acts. When any such lease involves housing facilities in a foreign country, the lease may be made on a multiyear basis for a period not to exceed five years, and, in accordance with local custom and practice, advance payment may be made for the lease. Such public housing facilities may be leased on an individual or multiple-unit basis. Expenditures for the rental of such housing facilities may not exceed the average authorized for the Department of Defense in any year except where the Secretary finds that the average is so low as to prevent rental of necessary housing facilities in some areas, in which event he is authorized to reallocate existing funds to high-cost areas so that rental expenditures in such areas exceed the average authorized for the Department of Defense.
<br>
<br>(b) The Secretary is authorized, subject to regulations approved by the President—
<br>
<br>(1) to designate as rental housing such housing as he may determine to be inadequate as public quarters; and
<br>
<br>(2) to lease inadequate housing to members of the Coast Guard for occupancy by them and their dependents.
<br>
<br>(c) Where sufficient quarters are not possessed by the United States, the Commandant may hire quarters for personnel, including personnel on sea duty at such times as they may be deprived of their quarters on board ship due to repairs or other conditions which may render them uninhabitable. Such accommodations shall not be available for occupancy by the dependents of such personnel.

<br>§3707. Temporary members of the Reserve; disability or death benefits
<br>
<br>(a) If a temporary member of the Reserve is physically injured, or dies as a result of physical injury, and the injury is incurred incident to service while performing active duty, or engaged in authorized travel to or from that duty, the law authorizing compensation for employees of the United States suffering injuries while in the performance of their duties, applies, subject to this section. That law shall be administered by the Secretary of Labor to the same extent as if the member was a civil employee of the United States and was injured in the performance of that duty. For benefit computation, regardless of pay or pay status, the member is considered to have had monthly pay of the monthly equivalent of the minimum rate of basic pay in effect for grade GS–9 of the General Schedule on the date the injury is incurred.
<br>
<br>(b) This section does not apply if the workmen's compensation law of a State, a territory, or another jurisdiction provides coverage because of a concurrent employment status of the temporary member. When the temporary member or a dependent is entitled to a benefit under this section and also to a concurrent benefit from the United States on account of the same disability or death, the temporary member or dependent, as appropriate, shall elect which benefit to receive.
<br>
<br>(c) If a claim is filed under this section with the Secretary of Labor for benefits because of an alleged injury or death, the Secretary of Labor shall notify the Commandant who shall direct an investigation into the facts surrounding the alleged injury or death. The Commandant shall then certify to the Secretary of Labor whether or not the injured or deceased individual was a temporary member of the Reserve, the individual's military status, and whether or not the injury or death was incurred incident to military service.
<br>
<br>(d) A temporary member of the Reserve, who incurs a physical disability or contracts sickness or disease while performing a duty to which the member has been assigned by competent authority, is entitled to the same hospital treatment afforded a member of the Regular Coast Guard.
<br>
<br>(e) In administering section 8133 of title 5, for an individual covered by this section—
<br>
<br>(1) the percentages applicable to payments under that section are—
<br>
<br>(A) 45 percent under subsection (a)(2) of that section, where the member died fully or currently insured under title II of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.), with no additional payments for a child or children so long as the widow or widower remains eligible for payments under that subsection;
<br>
<br>(B) 20 percent under subsection (a)(3) of that section, for one child, and 10 percent additional for each additional child, not to exceed a total of 75 percent, where the member died fully or currently insured under title II of the Social Security Act; and
<br>
<br>(C) 25 percent under subsection (a)(4) of that section, if one parent was wholly dependent for support upon the deceased member at the time of the member's death and the other was not dependent to any extent; 16 percent to each if both were wholly dependent; and if one was, or both were, partly dependent, a proportionate amount in the discretion of the Secretary of Labor;
<br>
<br>(2) payments may not be made under subsection (a)(5) of that section; and
<br>
<br>(3) the Secretary of Labor shall inform the Commissioner of Social Security whenever a claim is filed and eligibility for compensation is established under subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3) of section 8133 of title 5. The Commissioner of Social Security shall then certify to the Secretary of Labor whether or not the member concerned was fully or currently insured under title II of the Social Security Act at the time of the member's death.

<br>§3710. Reserve student pre-commissioning assistance program
<br>
<br>(a) The Secretary may provide financial assistance to an eligible enlisted member of the Coast Guard Reserve, not on active duty, for expenses of the member while the member is pursuing on a full-time basis at an institution of higher education a program of education approved by the Secretary that leads to—
<br>
<br>(1) a baccalaureate degree in not more than 5 academic years; or
<br>
<br>(2) a post-baccalaureate degree.
<br>
<br>(b)(1) To be eligible for financial assistance under this section, an enlisted member of the Coast Guard Reserve shall—
<br>
<br>(A) be enrolled on a full-time basis in a program of education referred to in subsection (a) at any institution of higher education; and
<br>
<br>(B) enter into a written agreement with the Coast Guard described in paragraph (2).
<br>
<br>(2) A written agreement referred to in paragraph (1)(B) is an agreement between the member and the Secretary in which the member agrees—
<br>
<br>(A) to accept an appointment as a commissioned officer in the Coast Guard Reserve, if tendered;
<br>
<br>(B) to serve on active duty for up to five years; and
<br>
<br>(C) under such terms and conditions as shall be prescribed by the Secretary, to serve in the Coast Guard Reserve until the eighth anniversary of the date of the appointment.
<br>
<br>(c) Expenses for which financial assistance may be provided under this section are the following:
<br>
<br>(1) Tuition and fees charged by the institution of higher education involved.
<br>
<br>(2) The cost of books.
<br>
<br>(3) In the case of a program of education leading to a baccalaureate degree, laboratory expenses.
<br>
<br>(4) Such other expenses as are deemed appropriate by the Secretary.
<br>
<br>(d) The amount of financial assistance provided to a member under this section shall be prescribed by the Secretary, but may not exceed $25,000 for any academic year.
<br>
<br>(e) Financial assistance may be provided to a member under this section for up to 5 consecutive academic years.
<br>
<br>(f) A member who receives financial assistance under this section may be ordered to active duty in the Coast Guard Reserve by the Secretary to serve in a designated enlisted grade for such period as the Secretary prescribes, but not more than 4 years, if the member—
<br>
<br>(1) completes the academic requirements of the program and refuses to accept an appointment as a commissioned officer in the Coast Guard Reserve when offered;
<br>
<br>(2) fails to complete the academic requirements of the institution of higher education involved; or
<br>
<br>(3) fails to maintain eligibility for an original appointment as a commissioned officer.
<br>
<br>(g)(1) If a member requests to be released from the program and the request is accepted by the Secretary, or if the member fails because of misconduct to complete the period of active duty specified, or if the member fails to fulfill any term or condition of the written agreement required to be eligible for financial assistance under this section, the financial assistance shall be terminated. The Secretary may request the member to reimburse the United States in an amount that bears the same ratio to the total costs of the education provided to that member as the unserved portion of active duty bears to the total period of active duty the member agreed to serve. The Secretary shall have the option to order such reimbursement without first ordering the member to active duty. An obligation to reimburse the United States imposed under this paragraph is a debt owed to the United States.
<br>
<br>(2) The Secretary may waive the service obligated under subsection (f) of a member who becomes unqualified to serve on active duty due to a circumstance not within the control of that member or who is not physically qualified for appointment and who is determined to be unqualified for service as an enlisted member of the Coast Guard Reserve due to a physical or medical condition that was not the result of the member's own misconduct or grossly negligent conduct.

<br>Prior Provisions
<br>
<br>Provisions similar to those in this section were contained in section 795 of this title prior to the complete revision of former chapter 21 of this title by Pub. L. 96–322.
<br>Amendments
<br>
<br>2018—Pub. L. 115–282, §123(b)(2), substituted "subsection 3757(b)" for "subsection 746(b)".
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 115–282, §118(b), renumbered section 723 of this title as this section.
<br>
<br>1 So in original. Probably should be "section 3757(b)".
<br>§3735. Authorized number of officers
<br>
<br>(a) The authorized number of officers in the Reserve in an active status is 5,000. Reserve officers on an active-duty list shall not be counted as part of the authorized number of officers in the Reserve. The actual number of Reserve officers in an active status at any time shall not exceed the authorized number unless the Secretary determines that a greater number is necessary for planned mobilization requirements, or unless the excess results directly from the operation of law.
<br>
<br>(b)(1) The Secretary shall make, at least once each year, a computation to determine the number of Reserve officers in an active status authorized to be serving in each grade. The number in each grade shall be computed by applying the applicable percentage to the total number of such officers serving in an active status on the date the computation is made. The number of Reserve officers in an active status below the grade of rear admiral (lower half) shall be distributed by pay grade so as not to exceed percentages of commissioned officers authorized by section 2103(b) of this title. When the actual number of Reserve officers in an active status in a particular pay grade is less than the maximum percentage authorized, the difference may be applied to the number in the next lower grade. A Reserve officer may not be reduced in rank or grade solely because of a reduction in an authorized number as provided for in this subsection, or because an excess results directly from the operation of law.
<br>
<br>(2) The authorized number of Reserve Officers in an active status not on active duty in the grades of rear admiral (lower half) and rear admiral is a total of two. However, the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating may authorize an additional number of Reserve officers not on active duty in the grades of rear admiral (lower half) and rear admiral as necessary in order to meet planned mobilization requirements.
<br>
<br>(c) Deferral of Limitation.—If at the end of any fiscal year there is in effect a declaration of war or national emergency, the President may defer the effectiveness of any end-strength limitation with respect to that fiscal year prescribed by law for any military or civilian component of the Coast Guard Reserve, for a period not to exceed 6 months after the end of the war or termination of the national emergency.

<br>
<br>(b) Notwithstanding any other law, a Reserve officer shall not lose precedence when transferred to or from the active duty promotion list, nor shall that officer's date of rank be changed due to the transfer.
<br>
