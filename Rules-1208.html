<br>The investment of the United States described in subsection (a) of this section—
<br>
<br>(1) shall be increased by—

Insofar as practicable, the value of such transferred property shall exclude any portion of such value properly allocable to national defense.

At the time of publication of such notice, the Commission shall make available to the public an analysis showing the basis and justification for the proposed change, which, in the case of a change in rates of tolls, shall indicate the conformity of the existing and proposed rates of tolls with the requirements of section 3792 of this title, and the Commission's adherence to the requirement for full consideration of the following factors set forth in Understanding (1) incorporated in the Resolution of Ratification of the Treaty Concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal (adopted by the United States Senate on March 16, 1978):

<br>
<br>After consideration of the relevant matter presented, the Commission may revise the proposed rules of measurement or rates of tolls, as the case may be, except that, in the case of rates of tolls, if such revision proposes rates greater than those originally proposed, a new analysis of the proposed rates shall be made available to the public, and a new notice of the revised proposal shall be published in the Federal Register apprising interested persons of the opportunity to participate further in the proceedings through submission of written data, views, or arguments, and participation in a public hearing to be held not less than 30 days after the date of publication of the new notice. The procedure set forth in this subsection shall be followed for any subsequent revision of the proposed rates of tolls by the Commission which proposes rates higher than those in the preceding proposal.
<br>(c) Publication of notice of changes in rules of measurement and rates of tolls in Federal Register
<br>
<br>After the proceedings have been conducted pursuant to subsections (a) and (b), the Commission may change the rules of measurement or rates of tolls, as the case may be. The Commission shall publish notice of any such change in the Federal Register not less than 30 days before the effective date of the change.

<br>SUBCHAPTER I—GENERAL PROVISIONS
<br>§3901. Congressional findings and objectives
<br>
<br>(a) The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) a career foreign service, characterized by excellence and professionalism, is essential in the national interest to assist the President and the Secretary of State in conducting the foreign affairs of the United States;
<br>
<br>(2) the scope and complexity of the foreign affairs of the Nation have heightened the need for a professional foreign service that will serve the foreign affairs interests of the United States in an integrated fashion and that can provide a resource of qualified personnel for the President, the Secretary of State, and the agencies concerned with foreign affairs;
<br>
<br>(3) the Foreign Service of the United States, established under the Act of May 24, 1924 (commonly known as the Rogers Act) and continued by the Foreign Service Act of 1946, must be preserved, strengthened, and improved in order to carry out its mission effectively in response to the complex challenges of modern diplomacy and international relations;
<br>
<br>(4) the members of the Foreign Service should be representative of the American people, aware of the principles and history of the United States and informed of current concerns and trends in American life, knowledgeable of the affairs, cultures, and languages of other countries, and available to serve in assignments throughout the world; and
<br>
<br>(5) the Foreign Service should be operated on the basis of merit principles.
<br>
<br>(b) The objective of this chapter is to strengthen and improve the Foreign Service of the United States by—
<br>
<br>(1) assuring, in accordance with merit principles, admission through impartial and rigorous examination, acquisition of career status only by those who have demonstrated their fitness through successful completion of probationary assignments, effective career development, advancement and retention of the ablest, and separation of those who do not meet the requisite standards of performance;
<br>
<br>(2) fostering the development and vigorous implementation of policies and procedures, including affirmative action programs, which will facilitate and encourage (A) entry into and advancement in the Foreign Service by persons from all segments of American society, and (B) equal opportunity and fair and equitable treatment for all without regard to political affiliation, race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, or handicapping condition;
<br>
<br>(3) providing for more efficient, economical, and equitable personnel administration through a simplified structure of Foreign Service personnel categories and salaries;
<br>
<br>(4) establishing a statutory basis for participation by the members of the Foreign Service, through their elected representatives, in the formulation of personnel policies and procedures which affect their conditions of employment, and maintaining a fair and effective system for the resolution of individual grievances that will ensure the fullest measure of due process for the members of the Foreign Service;
<br>
<br>(5) minimizing the impact of the hardships, disruptions, and other unusual conditions of service abroad upon the members of the Foreign Service, and mitigating the special impact of such conditions upon their families;
<br>
<br>(6) providing salaries, allowances, and benefits that will permit the Foreign Service to attract and retain qualified personnel as well as a system of incentive payments and awards to encourage and reward outstanding performance;
<br>
<br>(7) establishing a Senior Foreign Service which is characterized by strong policy formulation capabilities, outstanding executive leadership qualities, and highly developed functional, foreign language, and area expertise;
<br>
<br>(8) improving Foreign Service managerial flexibility and effectiveness;
<br>
<br>(9) increasing efficiency and economy by promoting maximum compatibility among the agencies authorized by law to utilize the Foreign Service personnel system, as well as compatibility between the Foreign Service personnel system and other personnel systems of the Government; and
<br>
<br>(10) otherwise enabling the Foreign Service to serve effectively the interests of the United States and to provide the highest caliber of representation in the conduct of foreign affairs.
