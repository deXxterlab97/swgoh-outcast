<br>Pub.

<br>§1701j–2. National Institute of Building Sciences
<br>(a) Congressional findings and declaration of purpose
<br>
<br>(1) The Congress finds (A) that the lack of an authoritative national source to make findings and to advise both the public and private sectors of the economy with respect to the use of building science and technology in achieving nationally acceptable standards and other technical provision for use in Federal, State, and local housing and building regulations is an obstacle to efforts by and imposes severe burdens upon all those who procure, design, construct, use, operate, maintain, and retire physical facilities, and frequently results in the failure to take full advantage of new and useful developments in technology which could improve our living environment; (B) that the establishment of model buildings codes or of a single national building code will not completely resolve the problem because of the difficulty at all levels of government in updating their housing and building regulations to reflect new developments in technology, as well as the irregularities and inconsistencies which arise in applying such requirements to particular localities or special local conditions; (C) that the lack of uniform housing and building regulatory provisions increases the costs of construction and thereby reduces the amount of housing and other community facilities which can be provided; and (D) that the existence of a single authoritative nationally recognized institution to provide for the evaluation of new technology could facilitate introduction of such innovations and their acceptance at the Federal, State, and local levels.
<br>
<br>(2) The Congress further finds, however, that while an authoritative source of technical findings is needed, various private organizations and institutions, private industry, labor, and Federal and other governmental agencies and entities are presently engaged in building research, technology development, testing, and evaluation, standards and model code development and promulgation, and information dissemination. These existing activities should be encouraged and these capabilities effectively utilized wherever possible and appropriate to the purposes of this section.
<br>
<br>(3) The Congress declares that an authoritative nongovernmental instrument needs to be created to address the problems and issues described in paragraph (1), that the creation of such an instrument should be initiated by the Government, with the advice and assistance of the National Academy of Sciences-National Academy of Engineering-National Research Council (hereinafter referred to as the "Academies-Research Council") and of the various sectors of the building community, including labor and management, technical experts in building science and technology, and the various levels of government.
<br>(b) Establishment; advice and assistance of Academies-Research Council and other agencies and organizations knowledgeable in building technology
<br>
<br>(1) There is authorized to be established, for the purposes described in subsection (a)(3), an appropriate nonprofit, nongovernmental instrument to be known as the National Institute of Building Sciences (hereinafter referred to as the "Institute"), which shall not be an agency or establishment of the United States Government. The Institute shall be subject to the provisions of this section and, to the extent consistent with this section, to a charter of the Congress if such a charter is requested and issued or to the District of Columbia Nonprofit Corporation Act if that is deemed preferable.
<br>
<br>(2) The Academies-Research Council, along with other agencies and organizations which are knowledgeable in the field of building technology, shall advise and assist in (A) the establishment of the Institute; (B) the development of an organizational framework to encourage and provide for the maximum feasible participation of public and private scientific, technical, and financial organizations, institutions, and agencies now engaged in activities pertinent to the development, promulgation, and maintenance of performance criteria, standards, and other technical provisions for building codes and other regulations; and (C) the promulgation of appropriate organizational rules and procedures including those for the selection and operation of a technical staff, such rules and procedures to be based upon the primary object of promoting the public interest and insuring that the widest possible variety of interests and experience essential to the functions of the Institute are represented in the Institute's operations. Recommendations of the Academies-Research Council shall be based upon consultations with and recommendations from various private organizations and institutions, labor, private industry, and governmental agencies entities operating in the field, and the Consultative Council as provided for under subsection (c)(8).
<br>
<br>(3) Nothing in this section shall be construed as expressing the intent of the Congress that the Academies-Research Council itself be required to assume any function or operation vested in the Institute by or under this section.
<br>(c) Board of Directors; number; appointment; membership; terms of office; vacancies; appointment, etc., of Chairman and Vice Chairman; employees of United States; travel and subsistence expenses; appointment and compensation of president and other executive officers and employees; establishment, membership, and functions of Consultative Council

<br>§1701q. Supportive housing for the elderly
<br>(a) Purpose
<br>
<br>The purpose of this section is to enable elderly persons to live with dignity and independence by expanding the supply of supportive housing that—
<br>
<br>(1) is designed to accommodate the special needs of elderly persons; and
<br>
<br>(2) provides a range of services that are tailored to the needs of elderly persons occupying such housing.
<br>(b) General authority
<br>
<br>The Secretary is authorized to provide assistance to private nonprofit organizations and consumer cooperatives to expand the supply of supportive housing for the elderly. Such assistance shall be provided as (1) capital advances in accordance with subsection (c)(1), and (2) contracts for project rental assistance in accordance with subsection (c)(2). Such assistance may be used to finance the construction, reconstruction, or moderate or substantial rehabilitation of a structure or a portion of a structure, or the acquisition of a structure, to be used as supportive housing for the elderly in accordance with this section. Assistance may also cover the cost of real property acquisition, site improvement, conversion, demolition, relocation, and other expenses that the Secretary determines are necessary to expand the supply of supportive housing for the elderly.
<br>(c) Forms of assistance
<br>(1) Capital advances
<br>
<br>A capital advance provided under this section shall bear no interest and its repayment shall not be required so long as the housing remains available for very low-income elderly persons in accordance with this section. Such advance shall be in an amount calculated in accordance with the development cost limitation established in subsection (h).
<br>(2) Project rental assistance
<br>
<br>Contracts for project rental assistance shall obligate the Secretary to make monthly payments to cover any part of the costs attributed to units occupied (or, as approved by the Secretary, held for occupancy) by very low-income elderly persons that is not met from project income. The annual contract amount for any project shall not exceed the sum of the initial annual project rentals for all units so occupied and any initial utility allowances for such units, as approved by the Secretary. Any contract amounts not used by a project in any year shall remain available to the project until the expiration of the contract. The Secretary may adjust the annual contract amount if the sum of the project income and the amount of assistance payments available under this paragraph are inadequate to provide for reasonable project costs.
<br>(3) Tenant rent contribution
<br>
<br>A very low-income person shall pay as rent for a dwelling unit assisted under this section the highest of the following amounts, rounded to the nearest dollar: (A) 30 percent of the person's adjusted monthly income, (B) 10 percent of the person's monthly income, or (C) if the person is receiving payments for welfare assistance from a public agency and a part of such payments, adjusted in accordance with the person's actual housing costs, is specifically designated by such agency to meet the person's housing costs, the portion of such payments which is so designated.
<br>(d) Term of commitment
<br>(1) Use limitations
<br>
<br>All units in housing assisted under this section shall be made available for occupancy by very low-income elderly persons for not less than 40 years.
<br>(2) Contract terms
<br>
<br>The initial term of a contract entered into under subsection (c)(2) shall be 240 months. The Secretary shall, to the extent approved in appropriation Acts, extend any expiring contract for a term of not less than 60 months. In order to facilitate the orderly extension of expiring contracts, the Secretary is authorized to make commitments to extend expiring contracts during the year prior to the date of expiration.
<br>(e) Applications
<br>
<br>Funds made available under this section shall be allocated by the Secretary among approvable applications submitted by private nonprofit organizations. Applications for assistance under this section shall be submitted by an applicant in such form and in accordance with such procedures as the Secretary shall establish. Such applications shall contain—
<br>
<br>(1) a description of the proposed housing;
<br>
<br>(2) a description of the assistance the applicant seeks under this section;
<br>
<br>(3) a description of the resources that are expected to be made available in compliance with subsection (h);
<br>
<br>(4) a description of (A) the category or categories of elderly persons the housing is intended to serve; (B) the supportive services, if any, to be provided to the persons occupying such housing; (C) the manner in which such services will be provided to such persons, including, in the case of frail elderly persons, evidence of such residential supervision as the Secretary determines is necessary to facilitate the adequate provision of such services; and (D) the public or private sources of assistance that can reasonably be expected to fund or provide such services;
<br>
<br>(5) a certification from the public official responsible for submitting a housing strategy for the jurisdiction to be served in accordance with section 12705 of title 42 that the proposed project is consistent with the approved housing strategy; and
<br>
<br>(6) such other information or certifications that the Secretary determines to be necessary or appropriate to achieve the purposes of this section.
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall not reject an application on technical grounds without giving notice of that rejection and the basis therefor to the applicant and affording the applicant an opportunity to respond.
<br>(f) Initial selection criteria and processing
<br>(1) Selection criteria
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall establish selection criteria for assistance under this section, which shall include—
<br>
<br>(A) the ability of the applicant to develop and operate the proposed housing;
<br>
<br>(B) the need for supportive housing for the elderly in the area to be served, taking into consideration the availability of public housing for the elderly and vacancy rates in such facilities;
<br>
<br>(C) the extent to which the proposed size and unit mix of the housing will enable the applicant to manage and operate the housing efficiently and ensure that the provision of supportive services will be accomplished in an economical fashion;
<br>
<br>(D) the extent to which the proposed design of the housing will meet the special physical needs of elderly persons;
<br>
<br>(E) the extent to which the applicant has demonstrated that the supportive services identified in subsection (e)(4) will be provided on a consistent, long-term basis;
<br>
<br>(F) the extent to which the applicant has ensured that a service coordinator will be employed or otherwise retained for the housing, who has the managerial capacity and responsibility for carrying out the actions described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of subsection (g)(2);

<br>
<br>(H) such other factors as the Secretary determines to be appropriate to ensure that funds made available under this section are used effectively.
<br>(2) Delegated processing
<br>
<br>(A) The Secretary shall establish procedures to delegate the award, review and processing of projects, selected by the Secretary in a national competition, to a State or local housing agency that—
<br>
<br>(i) is in geographic proximity to the property;
<br>
<br>(ii) has demonstrated experience in and capacity for underwriting multifamily housing loans that provide housing and supportive services;
<br>
<br>(iii) may or may not be providing low-income housing tax credits in combination with the funding under this section; and
