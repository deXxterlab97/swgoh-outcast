<br>Those that have made a covenant with Me by sacrifice.'
<br>6And the heavens declare His righteousness;
<br>For God, He is judge.	Selah
<br>7'Hear, O My people, and I will speak;
<br>O Israel, and I will testify against thee:
<br>God, thy God, am I.
<br>8I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices;
<br>And thy burnt-offerings are continually before Me.
<br> 
<br>9I will take no bullock out of thy house,
<br>Nor he-goats out of thy folds.
<br>10For every beast of the forest is Mine,
<br>And the cattle upon a thousand hills.
<br>11I know all the fowls of the mountains;
<br>And the wild beasts of the field are Mine.
<br>12If I were hungry, I would not tell thee;
<br>For the world is Mine, and the fulness thereof.
<br>13Do I eat the flesh of bulls, Or drink the blood of goats?
<br>14Offer unto God the sacrifice of thanksgiving;
<br>And pay thy vows unto the Most High;
<br>15And call upon Me in the day of trouble;
<br>I will deliver thee, and thou shalt honour Me.'
<br>
<br>16But unto the wicked God saith: 'What hast thou to do to declare My
<br>statutes,
<br>And that thou hast taken My covenant in thy mouth?
<br>17Seeing thou hatest instruction, And castest My words behind thee. 18When thou sawest a thief, thou
<br>hadst company with him,
<br>And with adulterers was thy portion.
<br>19Thou hast let loose thy mouth for evil,
<br>And thy tongue frameth deceit.
<br> 
<br>20Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother;
<br>Thou slanderest thine own mother's son.
<br>21These things hast thou done, and should I have kept silence?
<br>Thou hadst thought that I was altogether such a one as thyself;
<br>But I will reprove thee, and set the cause before thine eyes.
<br>
<br>22Now consider this, ye that forget God,
<br>Lest I tear in pieces, and there be none to deliver.
<br>23Whoso offereth the sacrifice of thanksgiving honoureth Me;
<br>And to him that ordereth his way aright
<br>Will I show the salvation of God.'
<br>
<br>For the Leader. A Psalm of David; 2when Nathan the
<br>prophet came unto him, after he had gone in to Bath-sheba.
<br>
<br>3Be gracious unto me, O God, according to Thy mercy;
<br>According to the multitude of Thy compassions blot out my transgressions.
<br>4Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity,
<br>And cleanse me from my sin. 5For I know my transgressions; And my sin is ever before me. 6Against Thee, Thee only, have I
<br>sinned,
<br> 
<br>And done that which is evil in Thy sight;
<br>That Thou mayest be justified when Thou speakest,
<br>And be in the right when Thou judgest.
<br>
<br>7Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity,
<br>And in sin did my mother conceive me.
<br>8Behold, Thou desirest truth in the inward parts;
<br>Make me, therefore, to know wisdom in mine inmost heart.
<br>9Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean;
<br>Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
<br>10Make me to hear joy and gladness;
<br>That the bones which Thou hast crushed may rejoice.
<br>11Hide Thy face from my sins, Aand blot out all mine iniquities. 12Create me a clean heart, O God;
<br>And renew a stedfast spirit within me.
<br>13Cast me not away from Thy presence;
<br>And take not Thy holy spirit from me.
<br>14Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation;
<br>And let a willing spirit uphold me.
<br>15Then will I teach transgressors Thy ways;
<br>And sinners shall return unto Thee.
<br> 
<br>16Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, Thou God of my salvation;
<br>So shall my tongue sing aloud of Thy righteousness.
<br>17O Lord, open Thou my lips;
<br>And my mouth shall declare Thy praise.
<br>18For Thou delightest not in sacrifice, else would I give it;
<br>Thou hast no pleasure in burnt- offering.
<br>19The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit;
<br>A broken and a contrite heart, O God, Thou wilt not despise.
<br>
<br>20Do good in Thy favour unto Zion; Build Thou the walls of Jerusalem. 21Then wilt Thou delight in the
<br>sacrifices of righteousness, in burnt-offering and whole offering;
<br>Then will they offer bullocks upon Thine altar.
<br>
<br>For the Leader. Maschil of David; 2when Doeg the
<br>Edomite came and told Saul, and said unto him: 'David is come to the house of Ahimelech.'
<br>
<br>3Why boastest thou thyself of evil, O mighty man?
<br>The mercy of God endureth continually.
<br>4Thy tongue deviseth destruction;
<br>Like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.
<br> 
<br>
<br>5Thou lovest evil more than good;
<br>Falsehood rather than speaking righteousness.	Selah
<br>6Thou lovest all devouring words, The deceitful tongue.
<br>7God will likewise break thee for ever,
<br>He will take thee up, and pluck thee out of thy tent,
<br>And root thee out of the land of the living.	Selah
<br>
<br>8The righteous also shall see, and fear,
<br>And shall laugh at him:
<br>9'Lo, this is the man that made not God his stronghold;
<br>But trusted in the abundance of his riches,
<br>And strengthened himself in his wickedness.'
<br>10But as for me, I am like a leafy olive-tree in the house of God;
<br>I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever.
<br>11I will give Thee thanks for ever, because Thou hast done it;
<br>And I will wait for Thy name, for it is good, in the presence of Thy saints.
<br>
<br>For the Leader; upon Mahalath. Maschil of David.
<br>
<br>2The fool hath said in his heart: 'There is no God';
<br>They have dealt corruptly, and have done abominable iniquity;
<br> 
<br>There is none that doeth good. 3God looked forth from heaven upon the children of men,
<br>To see if there were any man of understanding, that did seek after God.
<br>4Every one of them is unclean, they are together become impure;
<br>There is none that doeth good, no, not one.
<br>
<br>5’Shall not the workers of iniquity know it,
<br>Who eat up My people as they eat bread,
<br>And call not upon God?'
<br>6There are they in great fear, where no fear was;
<br>For God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee;
<br>Thou hast put them to shame, because God hath rejected them.
<br>
<br>7Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion!
<br>When God turneth the captivity of His people,
<br>Let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad.
<br>
<br>For the Leader; with string- music. Maschil of David:
<br>2when the Ziphites came and said to Saul: 'Doth not David hide himself with us?'
<br>
<br>3O God, save me by Thy name, And right me by Thy might.
<br>4O God, hear my prayer; give ear to the words of my mouth.
<br> 
<br>5For strangers are risen up against me,
<br>And violent men have sought after my soul;
<br>They have not set God before them.
<br>Selah
<br>6Behold, God is my helper;
<br>The Lord is for me as the upholder of my soul.
<br>7He will requite the evil unto them that lie in wait for me;
<br>Destroy Thou them in Thy truth.
<br>8With a freewill-offering will I sacrifice unto Thee;
<br>I will give thanks unto Thy name, O LORD, for it is good.
<br>9For He hath delivered me out of all trouble;
<br>And mine eye hath gazed upon mine enemies.
<br>
<br>For the Leader; with string- music. Maschil of David.
<br>
<br>2Give ear, O God, to my prayer;
<br>And hide not Thyself from my supplication.
<br>3Attend unto me, and answer me; I am distraught in my complaint,
<br>and will moan;
<br>4Because of the voice of the enemy,
<br>Because of the oppression of the wicked;
<br>For they cast mischief upon me, And in anger they persecute me. 5My heart doth writhe within me;
<br>And the terrors of death are fallen upon me.
<br>6Fear and trembling come upon me,
<br> 
<br>And horror hath overwhelmed me.
<br>7And I said: 'Oh that I had wings like a dove!
<br>Then would I fly away, and be at rest.
<br>8Lo, then would I wander far off, I would lodge in the wilderness.
<br>Selah
<br>9I would haste me to a shelter
<br>From the stormy wind and tempest.'
<br>10Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongue;
<br>For I have seen violence and strife in the city.
<br>11Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof;
<br>Iniquity also and mischief are in the midst of it.
<br>12Wickedness is in the midst thereof;
<br>Oppression and guile depart not from her broad place.
<br>13For it was not an enemy that taunted me,
<br>Then I could have borne it;
<br>Neither was it mine adversary that did magnify himself against me,
<br>Then I would have hid myself from him.
<br>14But it was thou, a man mine equal,
<br>My companion, and my familiar friend;
<br>15We took sweet counsel together,
<br>In the house of God we walked with the throng.
<br>16May He incite death against them,
<br>Let them go down alive into the nether-world;
<br>For evil is in their dwelling, and within them.
<br> 
<br>
<br>17As for me, I will call upon God; And the LORD shall save me.
<br>18Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I complain, and moan;
<br>And He hath heard my voice.
<br>19He hath redeemed my soul in peace so that none came nigh me;
<br>For they were many that strove with me.
<br>20God shall hear, and humble them, Even He that is enthroned of old,
<br>Selah
<br>Such as have no changes, And fear not God.
<br>21He hath put forth his hands against them that were at peace with him;
<br>He hath profaned his covenant.
<br>22Smoother than cream were the speeches of his mouth,
<br>But his heart was war;
<br>His words were softer than oil, Yet were they keen-edged swords.
<br>
<br>23Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and He will sustain thee;
<br>He will never suffer the righteous to be moved.
<br>24But Thou, O God, wilt bring them down into the nethermost pit;
<br>Men of blood and deceit shall not live out half their days;
<br>But as for me, I will trust in Thee.
<br>
<br>For the Leader; upon Jonath- elem-rehokim. [A Psalm] of
<br>David; Michtam; when the Philistines took him in Gath.
<br> 
<br>2Be gracious unto me, O God, for man would swallow me up;
<br>All the day he fighting oppresseth me.
<br>3They that lie in wait for me would swallow me up all the day;
<br>For they are many that fight against me, O Most High,
<br>4In the day that I am afraid, I will put my trust in Thee.
<br>5In God—I will praise His word—
<br>In God do I trust, I will not be afraid;
<br>What can flesh do unto me?
<br>
<br>6All the day they trouble mine affairs;
<br>All their thoughts are against me for evil.
<br>7They gather themselves together, they hide themselves,
<br>They mark my steps;
<br>According as they have waited for my soul.
<br>8Because of iniquity cast them out; In anger bring down the peoples, O
<br>God.
<br>9Thou has counted my wanderings; Put Thou my tears into Thy bottle; Are they not in Thy book?
<br>10Then shall mine enemies turn back in the day that I call;
<br>This I know, that God is for me.
<br>11In God—I will praise His word—
<br>In the LORD—I will praise His word—
<br>12In God do I trust, I will not be afraid;
<br>What can man do unto me?
<br> 
<br>
<br>13Thy vows are upon me, O God; I will render thank-offerings unto
<br>Thee.
<br>14For thou hast delivered my soul from death;
<br>Hast Thou not delivered my feet from stumbling?
<br>That I may walk before God in the light of the living?
<br>
<br>For the Leader; Al-tashheth. [A Psalm] of David; Michtam;
<br>when he fled from Saul, in the cave.
<br>
<br>2Be gracious unto me, O God, be gracious unto me,
<br>For in Thee hath my soul taken refuge;
<br>Yea, in the shadow of Thy wings will I take refuge,
<br>Until calamities be overpast.
<br>3I will cry unto God Most high;
<br>Unto God that accomplisheth it for me.
<br>4He will send from heaven, and save me,
<br>When he that would swallow me up taunteth,	Selah
<br>God shall send forth His mercy and His truth.
<br>5My soul is among lions, I do lie down among them that are aflame;
<br>Even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows,
<br>And their tongue a sharp sword.
<br>6Be Thou exalted, O God, above the heavens;
<br> 
<br>Thy glory be above all the earth.
<br>7They have prepared a net for my steps,
<br>My soul is bowed down;
<br>They have digged a pit before me,
<br>They are fallen into the midst thereof themselves.	Selah
<br>8My heart is stedfast, O God, my heart is stedfast;
<br>I will sing, yea, I will sing praises.
<br>9Awake, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp;
<br>I will awake the dawn.
<br>10I will give thanks unto Thee, O Lord, among the peoples;
<br>I will sing praises unto Thee among the nations.
<br>11For Thy mercy is great unto the heavens,
<br>And Thy truth unto the skies.
<br>12Be Thou exalted, O God, above the heavens;
<br>Thy glory be above all the earth.
<br>
<br>For the Leader; Al-tashheth. [A Psalm] of David; Michtam.
<br>
<br>2Do ye indeed speak as a righteous company?
<br>Do ye judge with equity the sons of men?
<br>3Yea, in heart ye work wickedness;
<br>Ye weigh out in the earth the violence of your hands.
<br>4The wicked are estranged from the womb;
<br>The speakers of lies go astray as soon as they are born.
<br> 
<br>5Their venom is like the venom of a serpent;
<br>They are like the deaf asp that stoppeth her ear;
<br>6Which hearkeneth not to the voice of charmers,
<br>Or of the most cunning binder of spells.
<br>
<br>7Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth;
<br>Break out the cheek-teeth of the young lions, O LORD.
<br>8Let them melt away as water that runneth apace;
<br>When he aimeth his arrows, let them be as though they were cut off.
<br>9Let them be as a snail which melteth and passeth away;
<br>Like the untimely births of a woman, that have not seen the sun.
<br>10Before your pots can feel the thorns,
<br>He will sweep it away with a whirlwind, the raw and the burning alike.
<br>
<br>11The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance;
<br>He shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.
<br>12And men shall say: 'Verily there is a reward for the righteous;
<br>Verily there is a God that judgeth in the earth.'
<br>
<br>For the Leader; Al-tashheth. [A Psalm] of David; Michtam;
<br> 
<br>when Saul sent, and they watched the house to kill him.
<br>
<br>2Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God;
<br>Set me on high from them that rise up against me.
<br>3Deliver me from the workers of iniquity,
<br>And save me from the men of blood.
<br>4For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul;
<br>The impudent gather themselves together against me;
<br>Not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O LORD.
<br>5Without my fault, they run and prepare themselves;
<br>Awake Thou to help me, and behold.
<br>6Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel,
<br>Arouse Thyself to punish all the nations;
<br>Show no mercy to any iniquitous traitors.	Selah
<br>
<br>7They return at evening, they howl like a dog,
<br>And go round about the city.
<br>8Behold, they belch out with their mouth;
<br>Swords are in their lips:
<br>'For who doth hear?'
<br>9But Thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them;
<br>Thou shalt have all the nations in derision.
<br>10Because of his strength, I will wait for Thee;
<br> 
<br>For God is my high tower.
<br>
<br>11The God of my mercy will come to meet me;
<br>God will let me gaze upon mine adversaries.
<br>12Slay them not, lest my people forget,
<br>Make them wander to and fro by Thy power, and bring them down,
<br>O Lord our shield.
<br>13For the sin of their mouth, and the words of their lips,
<br>Let them even be taken in their pride,
<br>And for cursing and lying which they speak.
<br>14Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they be no more;
<br>And let them know that God ruleth in Jacob,
<br>Unto the ends of the earth.	Selah
<br>
<br>15And they return at evening, they howl like a dog,
<br>And go round about the city;
<br>16They wander up and down to devour,
<br>And tarry all night if they have not their fill.
<br>17But as for me, I will sing of Thy strength;
<br>Yea, I will sing aloud of Thy mercy in the morning;
<br>For Thou hast been my high tower,
<br>And a refuge in the day of my distress.
<br>18O my strength, unto Thee will I sing praises;
<br> 
<br>For God is my high tower, the God of my mercy.
<br>
<br>For the Leader; upon Shushan Eduth; Michtam of David, to
<br>teach; 2when he strove with Aram- naharaim and with Aram-zobah, and Joab returned, and smote of Edom in the Valley of Salt twelve thousand.
<br>
<br>3O God, Thou hast cast us off, Thou hast broken us down;
<br>Thou hast been angry; O restore us.
<br>4Thou hast made the land to shake, Thou hast cleft it;
<br>Heal the breaches thereof; for it tottereth.
<br>5Thou hast made Thy people to see hard things;
<br>Thou hast made us to drink the wine of staggering.
<br>6Thou hast given a banner to them that fear Thee,
<br>That it may be displayed because of the truth.	Selah
<br>7That Thy beloved may be delivered,
<br>Save with Thy right hand, and answer me.
<br>
<br>8God spoke in His holiness, that I would exult;
<br>That I would divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
<br>9Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine;
<br>Ephraim also is the defence of my head;
<br>Judah is my sceptre.
<br> 
<br>10Moab is my washpot;
<br>Upon Edom do I cast my shoe; Philistia, cry aloud because of me!
<br>
<br>11Who will bring me into the fortified city?
<br>Who will lead me unto Edom? 12Hast not Thou, O God, cast us off? And Thou goest not forth, O God,
<br>with our hosts.
<br>13Give us help against the adversary; For vain is the help of man.
<br>14Through God we shall do valiantly;
<br>For He it is that will tread down our adversaries.
<br>
<br>For the Leader; with string- music. [A Psalm] of David.
<br>
<br>2Hear my cry, O God; Attend unto my prayer.
<br>3From the end of the earth will I call unto Thee, when my heart fainteth;
<br>Lead me to a rock that is too high for me.
<br>4For Thou hast been a refuge for me,
<br>A tower of strength in the face of the enemy.
<br>
<br>5I will dwell in Thy Tent for ever; I will take refuge in the covert of
<br>Thy wings.	Selah
<br>6For Thou, O God, hast heard my vows;
<br>Thou hast granted the heritage of those that fear Thy name.
<br> 
<br>7Mayest Thou add days unto the king's days!
<br>May his years be as many generations!
<br>8May he be enthroned before God for ever!
<br>Appoint mercy and truth, that they may preserve him.
<br>
<br>9So will I sing praise unto Thy name for ever,
<br>That I may daily perform my vows.
<br>
<br>For the Leader; for Jeduthun. A Psalm of David.
<br>
<br>2Only for God doth my soul wait in stillness;
<br>From Him cometh my salvation.
<br>3He only is my rock and my salvation,
<br>My high tower, I shall not be greatly moved.
<br>4How long will ye set upon a man, That ye may slay him, all of you,
<br> 
<br>8Upon God resteth my salvation and my glory;
<br>The rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.
<br>9Trust in Him at all times, ye people;
<br>Pour out your heart before Him; God is a refuge for us.	Selah
<br>
<br>10Men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie;
<br>If they be laid in the balances, they are together lighter than vanity.
<br>11Trust not in oppression,
<br>And put not vain hope in robbery;
<br>If riches increase, set not your heart thereon.
<br>12God hath spoken once, Twice have I heard this:
<br>That strength belongeth unto God;
<br>13Also unto Thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy;
<br>For Thou renderest to every man according to his work.
<br> 
<br>As a leaning wall, a tottering fence?
<br>5They only devise to thrust him down from his height, delighting in lies;
<br> 
<br>63
<br>Judah.
<br> 
<br>A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of
<br> 
<br>They bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly.	Selah
<br>
<br>6Only for God wait thou in stillness, my soul;
<br>For from Him cometh my hope.
<br>7He only is my rock and my salvation,
<br>My high tower, I shall not be moved.
<br> 
<br>2O God, Thou art my God, earnestly will I seek Thee;
<br>My soul thirsteth for Thee, my flesh longeth for Thee,
<br>In a dry and weary land, where no water is.
<br>3So have I looked for Thee in the sanctuary,
<br>To see Thy power and Thy glory.
<br> 
<br>4For Thy lovingkindness is better than life;
<br>My lips shall praise Thee.
<br>5So will I bless Thee as long as I live;
<br>In Thy name will I lift up my hands.
<br>
<br>6My soul is satisfied as with marrow and fatness;
<br>And my mouth doth praise Thee with joyful lips;
<br>7When I remember Thee upon my couch,
<br>And meditate on Thee in the night- watches.
<br>
<br>8For Thou hast been my help,
<br>And in the shadow of Thy wings do I rejoice.
<br>9My soul cleaveth unto Thee; Thy right hand holdeth me fast.
<br>
<br>10But those that seek my soul, to destroy it,
<br>Shall go into the nethermost parts of the earth.
<br>11They shall be hurled to the power of the sword;
<br>They shall be a portion for foxes.
<br>12But the king shall rejoice in God;
<br>Every one that sweareth by Him shall glory;
<br>For the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.
<br>
<br>For the Leader. A Psalm of David.
<br> 
<br>2Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint;
<br>Preserve my life from the terror of the enemy.
<br>3Hide me from the council of evil- doers;
<br>From the tumult of the workers of iniquity;
<br>4Who have whet their tongue like a sword,
<br>And have aimed their arrow, a poisoned word;
<br>5That they may shoot in secret places at the blameless;
<br>Suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.
<br>6They encourage one another in an evil matter;
<br>They converse of laying snares secretly;
<br>They ask, who would see them.
<br>7They search out iniquities, they have accomplished a diligent search;
<br>Even in the inward thought of every one, and the deep heart.
<br>
<br>8But God doth shoot at them with an arrow suddenly;
<br>Thence are their wounds.
<br>9So they make their own tongue a stumbling unto themselves;
<br>All that see them shake the head.
<br>10And all men fear;
<br>And they declare the work of God, And understand His doing.
<br>11The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall take refuge in Him;
<br> 
<br>And all the upright in heart shall glory.
<br>
<br>For the Leader. A Psalm. A Song of David.
<br>
<br>2Praise waiteth for Thee, O God, in Zion;
<br>And unto Thee the vow is performed.
<br>3O Thou that hearest prayer, Unto Thee doth all flesh come.
<br>4The tale of iniquities is too heavy for me;
<br>As for our transgressions, Thou wilt pardon them.
<br>5Happy is the man whom Thou choosest, and bringest near,
<br>That he may dwell in Thy courts;
<br>May we be satisfied with the goodness of Thy house,
<br>The holy place of Thy temple!
<br>
<br>6With wondrous works dost Thou answer us in righteousness,
<br>O God of our salvation;
<br>Thou the confidence of all the ends of the earth,
<br>And of the far distant seas;
<br>7Who by Thy strength settest fast the mountains,
<br>Who art girded about with might;
<br>8Who stillest the roaring of the seas, the roaring of their waves,
<br>And the tumult of the peoples;
<br>9So that they that dwell in the uttermost parts stand in awe of Thy signs;
<br> 
<br>Thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.
<br>
<br>10Thou hast remembered the earth, and watered her, greatly enriching her,
<br>With the river of God that is full of water;
<br>Thou preparest them corn, for so preparest Thou her.
<br>11Watering her ridges abundantly, Settling down the furrows thereof, Thou makest her soft with showers; Thou blessest the growth thereof.
<br>12Thou crownest the year with Thy goodness;
<br>And Thy paths drop fatness.
<br>13The pastures of the wilderness do drop;
<br>And the hills are girded with joy.
<br>14The meadows are clothed with flocks;
<br>The valleys also are covered over with corn;
<br>They shout for joy, yea, they sing.
<br>
<br>For the Leader. A Song, a Psalm.
<br>
<br>Shout unto God, all the earth;
<br>2Sing praises unto the glory of His name;
<br>Make His praise glorious.
<br>3Say unto God: 'How tremendous is Thy work!
<br>Through the greatness of Thy power shall Thine enemies dwindle away before Thee.
<br>4All the earth shall worship Thee,
<br> 
<br>And shall sing praises unto Thee;
<br>They shall sing praises to Thy name.'	Selah

<br>5Come, and see the works of God;
<br>He is terrible in His doing toward the children of men.
<br>6He turned the sea into dry land; They went through the river on foot; There let us rejoice in Him!
<br>7Who ruleth by His might for ever;
<br>His eyes keep watch upon the nations;
<br>Let not the rebellious exalt themselves.	Selah
<br>
<br>8Bless our God, ye peoples,
<br>And make the voice of His praise to be heard;
<br>9Who hath set our soul in life,
<br>And suffered not our foot to be moved,
<br>10For Thou, O God, hast tried us;
<br>Thou hast refined us, as silver is refined.
<br>11Thou didst bring us into the hold;
<br>Thou didst lay constraint upon our loins.
<br>12Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads;
<br>We went through fire and through water;
<br>But Thou didst bring us out unto abundance.
<br>
<br>13I will come into Thy house with burnt-offerings,
<br>I will perform unto Thee my vows,
<br>14Which my lips have uttered,
<br> 
<br>And my mouth hath spoken, when I was in distress.
<br>15I will offer unto Thee burnt- offerings of fatlings,
<br>With the sweet smoke of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats.
<br>Selah
<br>16Come, and hearken, all ye that fear God,
<br>And I will declare what He hath done for my soul.
<br>17I cried unto Him with my mouth,
<br>And He was extolled with my tongue.
<br>18If I had regarded iniquity in my heart,
<br>The Lord would not hear;
<br>19But verily God hath heard;
<br>He hath attended to the voice of my prayer.
<br>20Blessed be God,
<br>Who hath not turned away my prayer, nor His mercy from me.
<br>
<br>For the Leader; with string- music. A Psalm, a Song.
<br>
<br>2God be gracious unto us, and bless us;
<br>May He cause His face to shine toward us;	Selah
<br>3That Thy way may be known upon earth,
<br>Thy salvation among all nations.
<br>
<br>4Let the peoples give thanks unto Thee, O God;
<br>Let the peoples give thanks unto Thee, all of them.
<br> 
<br>5O let the nations be glad and sing for joy;
<br>For Thou wilt judge the peoples with equity,
<br>And lead the nations upon earth.
<br>Selah
<br>
<br>6Let the peoples give thanks unto Thee, O God;
<br>Let the peoples give thanks unto Thee, all of them.
<br>7The earth hath yielded her increase; May God, our own God, bless us.
<br>8May God bless us;
<br>And let all the ends of the earth fear Him.
<br>
<br>For the Leader. A Psalm of David, a Song.
<br>
<br>2Let God arise, let His enemies be scattered;
<br>And let them that hate Him flee before Him.
<br>3As smoke is driven away, so drive them away;
<br>As wax melteth before the fire,
<br>So let the wicked perish at the presence of God.
<br>4But let the righteous be glad, let them exult before God;
<br>Yea, let them rejoice with gladness.
<br>
<br>5Sing unto God, sing praises to His name;
<br>Extol Him that rideth upon the skies, whose name is the LORD;
<br>And exult ye before Him.
<br> 
<br>6A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows,
<br>Is God in His holy habitation.
<br>7God maketh the solitary to dwell in a house;
<br>He bringeth out the prisoners into prosperity;
<br>The rebellious dwell but in a parched land.
<br>8O God, when Thou wentest forth before Thy people,
<br>When Thou didst march through the wilderness;	Selah
<br>9The earth trembled, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God;
<br>Even yon Sinai trembled at the presence of God, the God of Israel.
<br>10A bounteous rain didst Thou pour down, O God;
<br>When Thine inheritance was weary, Thou didst confirm it.
<br>11Thy flock settled therein;
<br>Thou didst prepare in Thy goodness for the poor, O God.
<br>
<br>12The Lord giveth the word;
<br>The women that proclaim the tidings are a great host.
<br>13Kings of armies flee, they flee;
<br>And she that tarrieth at home divideth the spoil.
<br>14When ye lie among the sheepfolds,
<br>The wings of the dove are covered with silver,
<br>And her pinions with the shimmer of gold.
<br> 
<br>15When the Almighty scattereth kings therein,
<br>It snoweth in Zalmon.
<br>
<br>16A mountain of God is the mountain of Bashan;
<br>A mountain of peaks is the mountain of Bashan.
<br>17Why look ye askance, ye mountains of peaks,
<br>At the mountain which God hath desired for His abode?
<br>Yea, the LORD will dwell therein for ever.
<br>18The chariots of God are myriads, even thousands upon thousands;
<br>The Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in holiness.
<br>19Thou hast ascended on high, Thou hast led captivity captive;
<br>Thou hast received gifts among men,
<br>Yea, among the rebellious also, that the LORD God might dwell there.
<br>20Blessed be the Lord, day by day He beareth our burden,
<br>Even the God who is our salvation.
<br>Selah
<br>21God is unto us a God of deliverances;
<br>And unto GOD the Lord belong the issues of death.
<br>22Surely God will smite through the head of His enemies,
<br>The hairy scalp of him that goeth about in his guiltiness.
<br>23The Lord said: 'I will bring back from Bashan,
<br> 
<br>I will bring them back from the depths of the sea;
<br>24That thy foot may wade through blood,
<br>That the tongue of thy dogs may have its portion from thine enemies.'
<br>
<br>25They see Thy goings, O God, Even the goings of my God, my
<br>King, in holiness.
<br>26The singers go before, the minstrels follow after,
<br>In the midst of damsels playing upon timbrels.
<br>27'Bless ye God in full assemblies,
<br>Even the Lord, ye that are from the fountain of Israel.'
<br>28There is Benjamin, the youngest, ruling them,
<br>The princes of Judah their council,
<br>The princes of Zebulun, the princes of Naphtali.
<br>29Thy God hath commanded thy strength;
<br>Be strong, O God, Thou that hast wrought for us
<br>30Out of Thy temple at Jerusalem,
<br>Whither kings shall bring presents unto Thee.
<br>31Rebuke the wild beast of the reeds,
<br>The multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the peoples,
<br>Every one submitting himself with pieces of silver;
<br>He hath scattered the peoples that delight in war!
<br>32Nobles shall come out of Egypt;
<br> 
<br>Ethiopia shall hasten to stretch out her hands unto God.
<br>
<br>33Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth;
<br>O sing praises unto the Lord;
<br>Selah
<br>34To Him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which are of old;
<br>Lo, He uttereth His voice, a mighty voice.
<br>35Ascribe ye strength unto God; His majesty is over Israel,
<br>And His strength is in the skies.
<br>36Awful is God out of thy holy places;
<br>The God of Israel, He giveth strength and power unto the people;
<br>Blessed be God.
<br> 
<br>5They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head;
<br>They that would cut me off, being mine enemies wrongfully, are many;
<br>Should I restore that which I took not away?
<br>6O God, Thou knowest my folly; And my trespasses are not hid from
<br>Thee.
<br>7Let not them that wait for Thee be ashamed through me, O Lord GOD of hosts;
<br>Let not those that seek Thee be brought to confusion through me, O God of Israel.
<br>
<br>8Because for Thy sake I have borne reproach;
<br>Confusion hath covered my face.
<br>9I am become a stranger unto my
<br> 
<br>69
<br>David.
<br> 
<br>For the Leader; upon Shoshannim. [A Psalm] of
<br> 
<br>brethren,
<br>And an alien unto my mother's children.
<br>10Because zeal for Thy house hath
<br> 
<br>2Save me, O God;
<br>For the waters are come in even unto the soul.
<br>3I am sunk in deep mire, where there is no standing;
<br>I am come into deep waters, and the flood overwhelmeth me.
<br>4I am weary of my crying; my throat is dried;
<br>Mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.
<br> 
<br>eaten me up,
<br>And the reproaches of them that reproach Thee are fallen upon me.
<br>11And I wept with my soul with fasting,
<br>And that became unto me a reproach.
<br>12I made sackcloth also my garment, And I became a byword unto them. 13They that sit in the gate talk of me; And I am the song of the drunkards.
<br> 
<br>14But as for me, let my prayer be unto Thee, O LORD, in an acceptable time;
<br>O God, in the abundance of Thy mercy,
<br>Answer me with the truth of Thy salvation.
<br>15Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink;
<br>Let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.
<br>16Let not the waterflood overwhelm me,
<br>Neither let the deep swallow me up;
<br>And let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.
<br>17Answer me, O LORD, for Thy mercy is good;
<br>According to the multitude of Thy compassions turn Thou unto me.
<br>18And hide not Thy face from Thy servant;
<br>For I am in distress; answer me speedily.
<br>19Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it;
<br>Ransom me because of mine enemies.
<br>
<br>20Thou knowest my reproach, and my shame, and my confusion;
<br>Mine adversaries are all before Thee.
<br>21Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am sore sick;
<br>And I looked for some to show compassion, but there was none;
<br> 
<br>And for comforters, but I found none.
<br>22Yea, they put poison into my food;
<br>And in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
<br>
<br>23Let their table before them become a snare;
<br>And when they are in peace, let it become a trap.
<br>24Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not;
<br>And make their loins continually to totter.
<br>25Pour out Thine indignation upon them,
<br>And let the fierceness of Thine anger overtake them.
<br>26Let their encampment be desolate; Let none dwell in their tents.
<br>27For they persecute him whom Thou hast smitten;
<br>And they tell of the pain of those whom Thou hast wounded.
<br>28Add iniquity unto their iniquity;
<br>And let them not come into Thy righteousness.
<br>29Let them be blotted out of the book of the living,
<br>And not be written with the righteous.
<br>30But I am afflicted and in pain;
<br>Let Thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.
<br>31I will praise the name of God with a song,
<br>And will magnify Him with thanksgiving.
<br> 
<br>32And it shall please the LORD better than a bullock
<br>That hath horns and hoofs.
<br>33The humble shall see it, and be glad;
<br>Ye that seek after God, let your heart revive.
<br>34For the LORD hearkeneth unto the needy,
<br>And despiseth not His prisoners.
<br>35Let heaven and earth praise Him,
<br>The seas, and every thing that moveth therein.
<br>36For God will save Zion, and build the cities of Judah;
<br>And they shall abide there, and have it in possession.
<br>37The seed also of His servants shall inherit it;
<br>And they that love His name shall dwell therein.
<br>
<br>For the Leader. [A Psalm] of David; to make memorial.
<br>
<br>O God, to deliver me,
<br>O LORD, to help me, make haste. 2Let them be ashamed and abashed That seek after my soul;
<br>Let them be turned backward and brought to confusion
<br>That delight in my hurt.
<br>3Let them be turned back by reason of their shame
<br>That say: 'Aha, aha.'
<br>4Let all those that seek Thee rejoice and be glad in Thee;
<br>And let such as love Thy salvation say continually:
<br> 
<br>'Let God be magnified.'
<br>5But I am poor and needy; O God, make haste unto me;
<br>Thou art my help and my deliverer; O LORD, tarry not.
<br>
<br>In Thee, O LORD, have I taken refuge;
<br>Let me never be ashamed.
<br>2Deliver me in Thy righteousness, and rescue me;
<br>Incline Thine ear unto me, and save me.
<br>3Be Thou to me a sheltering rock, whereunto I may continually resort,
<br>Which Thou hast appointed to save me;
<br>For Thou art my rock and my fortress.
<br>
<br>4O my God, rescue me out of the hand of the wicked,
<br>Out of the grasp of the unrighteous and ruthless man.
<br>5For Thou art my hope;
<br>O Lord GOD, my trust from my youth.
<br>6Upon Thee have I stayed myself from birth;
<br>Thou art he that took me out of my mother's womb;
<br>My praise is continually of Thee. 7I am as a wonder unto many; But Thou art my strong refuge.
<br>8My mouth shall be filled with Thy praise,
<br>And with Thy glory all the day.
<br> 
<br>9Cast me not off in the time of old age;
<br>When my strength faileth, forsake me not.
<br>10For mine enemies speak concerning me,
<br>And they that watch for my soul take counsel together,
<br>11Saying: 'God hath forsaken him;
<br>Pursue and take him; for there is none to deliver.'
<br>12O God, be not far from me;
<br>O my God, make haste to help me.
<br>13Let them be ashamed and consumed that are adversaries to my soul;
<br>Let them be covered with reproach and confusion that seek my hurt.
<br>
<br>14But as for me, I will hope continually,
<br>And will praise Thee yet more and more.
<br>15My mouth shall tell of Thy righteousness,
<br>And of Thy salvation all the day; For I know not the numbers thereof. 16I will come with Thy mighty acts,
<br>O Lord GOD;
<br>I will make mention of Thy righteousness, even of Thine only.
<br>17O God, Thou hast taught me from my youth;
<br>And until now do I declare Thy wondrous works.
<br>18And even unto old age and hoary hairs, O God, forsake me not;
<br> 
<br>Until I have declared Thy strength unto the next generation,
<br>Thy might to every one that is to come.
<br>19Thy righteousness also, O God, which reacheth unto high heaven;
<br>Thou who hast done great things, O God, who is like unto Thee?
<br>20Thou, who hast made me to see many and sore troubles,
<br>Wilt quicken me again, and bring me up again from the depths of the earth.
<br>21Thou wilt increase my greatness, And turn and comfort me.
<br>22I also will give thanks unto Thee with the psaltery,
<br>Even unto Thy truth, O my God;
<br>I will sing praises unto Thee with the harp,
<br>O Thou Holy One of Israel.
<br>23My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing praises unto Thee;
<br>And my soul, which Thou hast redeemed.
<br>24My tongue also shall tell of Thy righteousness all the day;
<br>For they are ashamed, for they are abashed, that seek my hurt.
<br>72 [A Psalm] of Solomon.
<br>Give the king Thy judgments, O
<br>God,
<br>And Thy righteousness unto the king's son;
<br>2That he may judge Thy people with righteousness,
<br>And Thy poor with justice.
<br> 
<br>3Let the mountains bear peace to the people,
<br>And the hills, through righteousness.
<br>4May he judge the poor of the people,
<br>And save the children of the needy, And crush the oppressor.
<br>5They shall fear Thee while the sun endureth,
<br>And so long as the moon, throughout all generations.
<br>6May he come down like rain upon the mown grass,
<br>As showers that water the earth.
<br>7In his days let the righteous flourish,
<br>And abundance of peace, till the moon be no more.
<br>
<br>8May he have dominion also from sea to sea,
<br>And from the River unto the ends of the earth.
<br>9Let them that dwell in the wilderness bow before him;
<br>And his enemies lick the dust.
<br>10The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall render tribute;
<br>The kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.
<br>11Yea, all kings shall prostrate themselves before him;
<br>All nations shall serve him.
<br>12For he will deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and him that hath no helper.
<br>13He will have pity on the poor and needy,
<br> 
<br>And the souls of the needy he will save.
<br>14He will redeem their soul from oppression and violence,
<br>And precious will their blood be in his sight.
<br>15That they may live, and that he may give them of the gold of Sheba,
<br>That they may pray for him continually,
<br>Yea, bless him all the day.
<br>16May he be as a rich cornfield in the land upon the top of the mountains;
<br>May his fruit rustle like Lebanon;
<br>And may they blossom out of the city like grass of the earth.
<br>17May his name endure for ever;
<br>May his name be continued as long as the sun;
<br>May men also bless themselves by him;
<br>May all nations call him happy.
<br>
<br>18Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel,
<br>Who only doeth wondrous things;
<br>19And blessed be His glorious name for ever;
<br>And let the whole earth be filled with His glory.
<br>Amen, and Amen.
<br>
<br>20The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.
<br> 
<br>ספר שלישי
<br>BOOK III
<br>73	A Psalm of Asaph.
<br>Surely God is good to Israel,
<br>Even to such as are pure in heart.
<br>2But as for me, my feet were almost gone;
<br>My steps had well nigh slipped.
<br>3For I was envious at the arrogant,
<br>When I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
<br>4For there are no pangs at their death,
<br>And their body is sound.
<br>5In the trouble of man they are not; Neither are they plagued like men. 6Therefore pride is as a chain about
<br>their neck;
<br>Violence covereth them as a garment.
<br>7Their eyes stand forth from fatness;
<br>They are gone beyond the imaginations of their heart.
<br>8They scoff, and in wickedness utter oppression;
<br>They speak as if there were none on high.
<br>9They have set their mouth against the heavens,
<br>And their tongue walketh through the earth.
<br>10Therefore His people return hither;
<br>And waters of fullness are drained out by them.
<br> 
<br>11And they say: 'How doth God know?
<br>And is there knowledge in the Most High?'
<br>12Behold, such are the wicked;
<br>And they that are always at ease increase riches.
<br>13Surely in vain have I cleansed my heart,
<br>And washed my hands in innocency;
<br>14For all the day have I been plagued,
<br>And my chastisement came every morning.
<br>
<br>15If I had said: 'I will speak thus',
<br>Behold, I had been faithless to the generation of Thy children.
<br>16And when I pondered how I might know this,
<br>It was wearisome in mine eyes;
<br>17Until I entered into the sanctuary of God,
<br>And considered their end.
<br>18Surely Thou settest them in slippery places;
<br>Thou hurlest them down to utter ruin.
<br>19How are they become a desolation in a moment!
<br>They are wholly consumed by terrors.
<br>20As a dream when one awaketh, So, O Lord, when Thou arousest
<br>Thyself, Thou wilt despise their semblance.
<br>21For my heart was in a ferment, And I was pricked in my reins.
<br> 
<br>22But I was brutish, and ignorant; I was as a beast before Thee.
<br>
<br>23Nevertheless I am continually with Thee;
<br>Thou holdest my right hand.
<br>24Thou wilt guide me with Thy counsel,
<br>And afterward receive me with glory.
<br>25Whom have I in heaven but Thee?
<br>And beside Thee I desire none upon earth.
<br>26My flesh and my heart faileth;
<br>But God is the rock of my heart and my portion for ever.
<br>27For, lo, they that go far from Thee shall perish;
<br>Thou dost destroy all them that go astray from Thee.
<br>28But as for me, the nearness of God is my good;
<br>I have made the Lord GOD my refuge,
<br>That I may tell of all Thy works.
<br>74	Maschil of Asaph.
<br>Why, O God, hast Thou cast us off
<br>for ever?
<br>Why doth Thine anger smoke against the flock of Thy pasture?
<br>2Remember Thy congregation, which Thou hast gotten of old,
<br>Which Thou hast redeemed to be the tribe of Thine inheritance;
<br>And mount Zion, wherein Thou hast dwelt.
<br> 
<br>3Lift up Thy steps because of the perpetual ruins,
<br>Even all the evil that the enemy hath done in the sanctuary.
<br>4Thine adversaries have roared in the midst of Thy meeting-place;
<br>They have set up their own signs for signs.
<br>5It seemed as when men wield upwards
<br>Axes in a thicket of trees.
<br>6And now all the carved work thereof together
<br>They strike down with hatchet and hammers.
<br>7They have set Thy sanctuary on fire;
<br>They have profaned the dwelling- place of Thy name even to the ground.
<br>8They said in their heart: 'Let us make havoc of them altogether';
<br>They have burned up all the meeting-places of God in the land.
<br>9We see not our signs;
<br>There is no more any prophet;
<br>Neither is there among us any that knoweth how long.
<br>10How long, O God, shall the adversary reproach?
<br>Shall the enemy blaspheme Thy name for ever?
<br>11Why withdrawest Thou Thy hand, even Thy right hand?
<br>Draw it out of Thy bosom and consume them.
