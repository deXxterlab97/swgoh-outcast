<br>(b) Consolidation of programs
<br>
<br>Upon the receipt of an acceptable plan under subsection (a), the Secretary, in cooperation with each Federal agency providing grants for the provision of education and related services to the entity, shall authorize the entity to consolidate, in accordance with such plan, the federally funded education and related services programs of the entity and the Federal programs, or portions of the programs, serving Indian students in a manner that integrates the program services involved into a single, coordinated, comprehensive program and reduces administrative costs by consolidating administrative functions.
<br>(c) Programs affected
<br>
<br>The funds that may be consolidated in a demonstration project under any such plan referred to in subsection (a) shall include funds for any Federal program exclusively serving Indian children, or the funds reserved under any Federal program to exclusively serve Indian children, under which the entity is eligible for receipt of funds under a statutory or administrative formula for the purposes of providing education and related services that would be used to serve Indian students.
<br>(d) Plan requirements
<br>
<br>For a plan to be acceptable pursuant to subsection (b), the plan shall—
<br>
<br>(1) identify the programs or funding sources to be consolidated;
<br>
<br>(2) be consistent with the objectives of this section concerning authorizing the services to be integrated in a demonstration project;
<br>
<br>(3) describe a comprehensive strategy that identifies the full range of potential educational opportunities and related services to be provided to assist Indian students to achieve the objectives set forth in this subpart;

<br>(e) Plan review
<br>
<br>Upon receipt of the plan from an eligible entity, the Secretary shall consult with the Secretary of each Federal department providing funds to be used to implement the plan, and with the entity submitting the plan. The parties so consulting shall identify any waivers of statutory requirements or of Federal departmental regulations, policies, or procedures necessary to enable the entity to implement the plan. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of the affected department shall have the authority to waive any regulation, policy, or procedure promulgated by that department that has been so identified by the entity or department, unless the Secretary of the affected department determines that such a waiver is inconsistent with the objectives of this subpart or those provisions of the statute from which the program involved derives authority that are specifically applicable to Indian students.
<br>(f) Plan approval
<br>
<br>Within 90 days after the receipt of an entity's plan by the Secretary, the Secretary shall inform the entity, in writing, of the Secretary's approval or disapproval of the plan.

<br>(i) Report requirements
<br>
<br>A single report format shall be developed by the Secretary, consistent with the requirements of this section. Such report format shall require that reports described in subsection (h), together with records maintained on the consolidated program at the local level, shall contain such information as will allow a determination that the eligible entity has complied with the requirements incorporated in its approved plan, including making a demonstration of student academic achievement, and will provide assurances to each Secretary that the eligible entity has complied with all directly applicable statutory requirements and with those directly applicable regulatory requirements that have not been waived.
<br>(j) No reduction in amounts

<br>In no case shall the amount of Federal funds available to an eligible entity involved in any demonstration project be reduced as a result of the enactment of this section.

<br>(l) Administration of funds
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Program funds for the consolidated programs shall be administered in such a manner as to allow for a determination that funds from a specific program are spent on allowable activities authorized under such program, except that the eligible entity shall determine the proportion of the funds granted that shall be allocated to such program.
<br>(2) Separate records not required
<br>
<br>Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring the eligible entity to maintain separate records tracing any services or activities conducted under the approved plan to the individual programs under which funds were authorized for the services or activities, nor shall the eligible entity be required to allocate expenditures among such individual programs.

<br>
<br>The eligible entity may commingle all administrative funds from the consolidated programs and shall be entitled to the full amount of such funds (under each program's or agency's regulations).

Nothing in subsection (b) shall be construed to require the furnishing of an enrollment number.
<br>(2) No new or duplicative determinations
<br>
<br>Once a child is determined to be an Indian eligible to be counted for such grant award, the local educational agency shall maintain a record of such determination and shall not require a new or duplicate determination to be made for such child for a subsequent application for a grant under this subpart.

The sampling conducted under this subparagraph shall take into account the size of and the geographic location of each local educational agency.
<br>(B) Exception
<br>
<br>A local educational agency may not be held liable to the United States or be subject to any penalty, by reason of the findings of an audit that relates to the date of completion, or the date of submission, of any forms used to establish, before April 28, 1988, the eligibility of a child for an entitlement under the Indian Elementary and Secondary School Assistance Act.
