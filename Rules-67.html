<br> 
<br>ers, and the way of lying in the prophets of Jerusalem: and they strengthened the hands of the wicked, that no man should return from his evil doings, they are all become unto me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomor- rha.
<br>15	Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts to the prophets: Behold I will feed them with wormwood, and will give them gall to drink: for from the prophets of Jerusalem corruption is gone forth into all the land.
<br>16	Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Hearken not to the words of the prophets that prophesy to you, and deceive you: they speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the Lord. 17 They say to them that blaspheme me: The Lord hath said: You shall have peace: and to every one that walketh in the perverseness of his own heart, they have said: No evil shall come
<br>upon you.
<br>18	For who hath stood in the counsel of the Lord, and hath seen and heard his word? Who hath considered his word and heard it?
<br>19	Behold the whirlwind of the Lord’s indig- nation shall come forth, and a tempest shall break out and come upon the head of the wicked. 20 The wrath of the Lord shall not return till he execute it, and till he accomplish the thought of his heart: in the latter days you shall under-
<br>stand his counsel.
<br>21	I did not send prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied.
<br>22	If they had stood in my counsel, and had made my words known to my people, I should have turned them from their evil way, and from their wicked doings.
<br>23	Am I, think ye, a God at hand, saith the Lord, and not a God afar off?
<br>24	Shall a man be hid in secret places, and I not see him, saith the Lord? do not I fill heaven
<br> 
<br>and earth, saith the Lord?
<br>25	I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my name, and say: I have dreamed, I have dreamed.
<br>26	How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies, and that prophesy the delusions of their own heart?
<br>27	Who seek to make my people forget my name through their dreams, which they tell every man to his neighbour: as their fathers forgot my name for Baal.
<br>28	The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream: and he that hath my word, let him speak my word with truth: what hath the chaff to do with the wheat, saith the Lord?
<br>29	Are not my words as a fire, saith the Lord: and as a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?
<br>30	Therefore behold I am against the prophets, saith the Lord: who steal my words every one from his neighbour.
<br>31	Behold I am against the prophets, saith the Lord: who use their tongues, and say: The Lord saith it.
<br>32	Behold I am against the prophets that have lying dreams, saith the Lord: and tell them, and cause my people to err by their lying, and by their wonders: when I sent them not, nor com- manded them, who have not profited this people at all, saith the Lord.
<br>33	If therefore this people, or the prophet, or the priest shall ask thee, saying: What is the burden of the Lord? thou shalt say to them: You are the burden: for I will cast you away, saith the Lord.
<br>34	And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people that shall say: The burden of the Lord: I will visit upon that man, and upon his house.
<br>35	Thus shall you say every one to his neigh-
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>bour, and to his brother, What hath the Lord answered? and what hath the Lord spoken?
<br>36	And the burden of the Lord shall be men- tioned no more, for every man’s word shall be his burden: for you have perverted the words of the living God, of the Lord of hosts our God.
<br>37	Thus shalt thou say to the prophet: What hath the Lord answered thee?   and what hath the Lord spoken?
<br>38	But if you shall say: The burden of the Lord: therefore thus saith the Lord: Because you have said this word: The burden of the Lord: and I have sent to you, saying: Say not, The burden of the Lord:
<br>39	Therefore behold I will take you away car- rying you, and will forsake you, and the city which I gave to you, and to your fathers, out of my presence.
<br>40	And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame which shall never be forgotten.
<br>
<br>Chapter 24
<br>The Lord shewed me: and behold two bas- kets full of figs, set before the temple of the Lord: after that Nabuchodonosor king of Baby- lon had carried away Jechonias the son of Joakim the king of Juda, and his chief men, and the craftsmen, and engravers of Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.
<br>2	One basket had very good figs, like the figs of the first season: and the other basket had very bad figs, which could not be eaten, because they were bad.
<br>3	And the Lord said to me: What seest thou, Jeremias? And I said: Figs, the good figs, very good: and the bad figs, very bad, which cannot be eaten because they are bad.
<br> 
<br>4	And the word of the Lord came to me, say- ing:
<br>5	Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: Like these good figs, so will I regard the captives of Juda, whom I have sent forth out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans, for their good.
<br>6	And I will set my eyes upon them to be pacified, and I will bring them again into this land: and I will build them up, and not pull them down: and I will plant them, and not pluck them up.
<br>7	And I will give them a heart to know me, that I am the Lord: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: because they shall return to me with their whole heart.
<br>8	And as the very bad figs, that cannot be eaten, because they are bad: thus saith the Lord: So will I give Sedecias the king of Juda, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that have remained in this city, and that dwell in the land of Egypt.
<br>9	And I will deliver them up to vexation, and affliction, to all the kingdoms of the earth: to be a reproach, and a byword, and a proverb, and to be a curse in all places, to which I have cast them out.
<br>10	And I will send among them the sword, and the famine, and the pestilence: till they be consumed out of the land which I gave to them, and their fathers.
<br>
<br>Chapter 25
<br>The word that came to Jeremias concerning all the people of Juda, in the fourth year of Joakim the son of Josias king of Juda, (the same is the first year of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon,)
<br>2	Which Jeremias the prophet spoke to all the people of Juda, and to all the inhabitants
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>of Jerusalem, saying:
<br>3	From the thirteenth year of Josias the son of Ammon king of Juda until this day: this is the three and twentieth year, the word of the Lord hath come to me, and I have spoken to you, rising before day, and speaking, and you have not hearkened.
<br>4	And the Lord hath sent to you all his ser- vants the prophets, rising early, and sending, and you have not hearkened, nor inclined your ears to hear.
<br>5	When he said: Return ye, every one from his evil way, and from your wicked devices, and you shall dwell in the land which the Lord hath given to you, and your fathers for ever and ever. 6 And go not after strange gods to serve them, and adore them: nor provoke me to wrath by the
<br>works of your hands, and I will not afflict you.
<br>7	And you have not heard me, saith the Lord, that you might provoke me to anger with the works of your hands, to your own hurt.
<br>8	Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts: Be- cause you have not heard my words:
<br>9	Behold I will send, and take all the kin- dreds of the north, saith the Lord, and Nabu- chodonosor the king of Babylon my servant: and I will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all the na- tions that are round about it: and I will destroy them, and make them an astonishment and a hissing, and perpetual desolations.
<br>10	And I will take away from them the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the sound of the mill and the light of the lamp.
<br>11	And all this land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment: and all these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.
<br>12	And when the seventy years shall be ex- pired, I will punish the king of Babylon, and
<br> 
<br>that nation, saith the Lord, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans: and I will make it perpetual desolations.
<br>13	And I will bring upon that land all my words, that I have spoken against it, all that is written in this book, all that Jeremias hath prophesied against all nations:
<br>14	For they have served them, whereas they were many nations, and great kings: and I will repay them according to their deeds, and accord- ing to the works of their hands.
<br>15	For thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Take the cup of wine of this fury at my hand: and thou shalt make all the nations to drink thereof, into which I shall send thee.
<br>16	And they shall drink, and be troubled, and be mad because of the sword, which I shall send among them.
<br>17	And I took the cup at the hand of the Lord, and I presented it to all the nations to drink of it, to which the Lord sent me:
<br>18	To wit, Jerusalem, and the cities of Juda, and the kings thereof, and the princes thereof: to make them a desolation, and an astonishment, and a hissing, and a curse, as it is at this day.
<br>19	Pharao the king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes, and all his people,
<br>20	And all in general: all the kings of the land of Ausitis, and all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and Ascalon, and Gaza, and Ac- caron, and the remnant of Azotus.
<br>21	And Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon.
<br>22	And all the kings of Tyre, and all the kings of Sidon: and the kings of the land of the islands that are beyond the sea.
<br>23	And Dedan, and Thema, and Buz, and all that have their hair cut round.
<br>24	And all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the west, that dwell in the desert.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>25	And all the kings of Zambri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes:
<br>26	And all the kings of the north far and near, every one against his brother: and all the kingdoms of the earth, which are upon the face thereof: and the king of Sesac shall drink after them.
<br>27	And thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Drink ye, and be drunken, and vomit: and fall, and rise no more, because of the sword, which I shall send among you.
<br>28	And if they refuse to take the cup at thy hand to drink, thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Drinking you shall drink: 29 For behold I begin to bring evil on the city wherein my name is called upon: and shall you be as innocent and escape free? you shall not escape free: for I will call for the sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith the Lord of
<br>hosts.
<br>30	And thou shalt prophesy unto them all these words, and thou shalt say to them: I The Lord shall roar from on high, and shall utter his voice from his holy habitation: roaring he shall roar upon the place of his beauty: the shout as it were of them that tread grapes shall be given out against all the inhabitants of the earth.
<br>31	The noise is come even to the ends of the earth: for the Lord entereth into judgment with the nations: he entereth into judgment with all flesh; the wicked I have delivered up to the sword, saith the Lord.
<br>32	Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Behold evil shall go forth from nation to nation: and a great whirlwind shall go forth from the ends of the earth.
<br>33	And the slain of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even to the other end thereof: they shall not be lamented, and
<br> 
<br>they shall not be gathered up, nor buried: they shall lie as dung upon the face of the earth.
<br>34	Howl, ye shepherds, and cry: and sprinkle yourselves with ashes, ye leaders of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and your dispersion are accomplished, and you shall fall like precious vessels.
<br>35	And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the leaders of the flock to save them- selves.
<br>36	A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and a howling of the principal of the flock: because the Lord hath wasted their pastures.
<br>37	And the fields of peace have been silent because of the fierce anger of the Lord.
<br>38	He hath forsaken his covert as the lion, for the land is laid waste because of the wrath of the dove, and because of the fierce anger of the Lord.
<br>
<br>Chapter 26
<br>In the beginning of the reign of Joakim the son of Josias king of Juda, came this word from the Lord, saying:
<br>2	Thus saith the Lord: stand in the court of the house of the Lord, and speak to all the cities of Juda, out of which they come, to adore in the house of the Lord, all the words which I have commanded thee to speak unto them: leave not out one word.
<br>3	If so be they will hearken and be converted every one from his evil way; that I may repent me of the evil that I think to do unto them for the wickedness of their doings.
<br>4	And thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord: If you will not hearken to me to walk in my law, which I have given you:
<br>5	To give ear to the words of my servants the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>prophets, whom I sent to you rising up early: and sending, and you have not hearkened:
<br>6	I will make this house like Silo: and I will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.
<br>7	And the priests, and the prophets, and all the people heard Jeremias speaking these words in the house of the Lord.
<br>8	And when Jeremias had made an end of speaking all that the Lord had commanded him to speak to all the people, the priests, and the prophets, and all the people laid hold on him, saying: Let him be put to death.
<br>9	Why hath he prophesied in the name of the Lord, saying: This house shall be like Silo; and this city shall be made desolate, without an in- habitant? And all the people were gathered to- gether against Jeremias in the house of the Lord. 10 And the princes of Juda heard these words: and they went up from the king’s house into the house of the Lord, and sat in the entry of the
<br>new gate of the house of the Lord.
<br>11	And the priests and the prophets spoke to the princes, and to all the people, saying: The judgment of death is for this man: because he hath prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your ears.
<br>12	Then Jeremias spoke to all the princes, and to all the people, saying: The Lord sent me to prophesy concerning this house, and concerning this city all the words that you have heard.
<br>13	Now therefore amend your ways, and your doings, and hearken to the voice of the Lord your God: and the Lord will repent him of the evil that he hath spoken against you.
<br>14	But as for me, behold I am in your hands: do with me what is good and right in your eyes: 15 But know ye, and understand, that if you put me to death, you will shed innocent blood against your own selves, and against this city,
<br> 
<br>and the inhabitants thereof. For in truth the Lord sent me to you, to speak all these words in your hearing.
<br>16	Then the princes, and all the people said to the priests, and to the prophets: There is no judgment of death for this man: for he hath spo- ken to us in the name of the Lord our God.
<br>17	And some of the ancients of the land rose up: and they spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying:
<br>18	Micheas of Morasthi was a prophet in the days of Ezechias king of Juda, and he spoke to all the people of Juda, saying: Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Sion shall be ploughed like a field, and Jerusalem shall be a heap of stones: and the mountain of the house the high places of woods. 19 Did Ezechias king of Juda, and all Juda, condemn him to death? did they not fear the Lord, and beseech the face of the Lord: and the Lord repented of the evil that he had spoken against them? therefore we are doing a great
<br>evil against our souls.
<br>20	There was also a man that prophesied in the name of the Lord, Urias the son of Semei of Cariathiarim: and he prophesied against this city, and against this land, according to all the words of Jeremias.
<br>21	And Joakim, and all his men in power, and his princes heard these words: and the king sought to put him to death. And Urias heard it, and was afraid, and fled and went into Egypt.
<br>22	And king Joakim sent men into Egypt, El- nathan the son of Achobor, and men with him into Egypt.
<br>23	And they brought Urias out of Egypt: and brought him to king Joakim, and he slew him with the sword: and he cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.
<br>24	So the hand of Ahicam the son of Saphan was with Jeremias, that he should not be deliv-
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>ered into the hands of the people, to put him to death.
<br>
<br>Chapter 27
<br>In the beginning of the reign of Joakim the son of Josias king of Juda, this word came to Jeremias from the Lord, saying:
<br>2	Thus saith the Lord to me: Make thee bands, and chains: and thou shalt put them on thy neck.
<br>3	And thou shalt send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the children of Ammon, and to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Sidon: by the hand of the messengers that are come to Jerusalem to Sedecias the king of Juda.
<br>4	And thou shalt command them to speak to their masters: Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Thus shall you say to your mas- ters:
<br>5	I made the earth, and the men and the beasts that are upon the face of the earth, by my great power, and by my stretched out arm: and I have given it to whom it seemed good in my eyes.
<br>6	And now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon my servant: moreover also the beasts of the field I have given him to serve him.
<br>7	And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son’s son: till the time come for his land and himself: and many nations and great kings shall serve him.
<br>8	But the nation and kingdom that will not serve Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and whosoever will not bend his neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon: I will visit upon that na- tion with the sword, and with famine, and with
<br> 
<br>pestilence, saith the Lord: till I consume them by his hand.
<br>9	Therefore hearken not to your prophets, and diviners, and dreamers, and soothsayers, and sorcerers, that say to you: You shall not serve the king of Babylon.
<br>10	For they prophesy lies to you: to remove you far from your country, and cast you out, and to make you perish.
<br>11	But the nation that shall bend down their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and shall serve him: I will let them remain in their own land, saith the Lord: and they shall till it, and dwell in it.
<br>12	And I spoke to Sedecias the king of Juda according to all these words, saying: Bend down your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, and his people, and you shall live. 13 Why will you die, thou and thy people by the sword, and by famine, and by the pestilence, as the Lord hath spoken against the nation that
<br>will not serve the king of Babylon?
<br>14	Hearken not to the words of the prophets that say to you: You shall not serve the king of Babylon: for they tell you a lie.
<br>15	For I have not sent them, saith the Lord: and they prophesy in my name falsely: to drive you out, and that you may perish, both you, and the prophets that prophesy to you.
<br>16	I spoke also to the priests, and to this peo- ple, saying: Thus saith the Lord: Hearken not to the words of your prophets, that prophesy to you, saying: Behold the vessels of the Lord shall now in a short time be brought again from Baby- lon: for they prophesy a lie unto you.
<br>17	Therefore hearken not to them, but serve the king of Babylon, that you may live. Why should this city be given up to desolation?
<br>18	But if they be prophets, and the word of the Lord be in them: let them interpose them-
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>selves before the Lord of hosts, that the vessels which were left in the house of the Lord, and in the house of the king of Juda, and in Jerusalem, may not go to Babylon.
<br>19	For thus saith the Lord of hosts to the pil- lars, and to the sea, and to the bases, and to the rest of the vessels that remain in this city:
<br>20	Which Nabuchodonosor the king of Baby- lon did not take, when he carried away Jecho- nias the son of Joakim the king of Juda, from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the great men of Juda and Jerusalem.
<br>21	For thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel, to the vessels that are left in the house of the Lord, and in the house of the king of Juda and Jerusalem:
<br>22	They shall be carried to Babylon, and there they shall be until the day of their visitation, saith the Lord: and I will cause them to be brought, and to be restored in this place.
<br>
<br>Chapter 28
<br>And it came to pass in that year, in the begin- ning of the reign of Sedecias king of Juda, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, that Hananias the son of Azur, a prophet of Gabaon spoke to me, in the house of the Lord before the priests, and all the people, saying:
<br>2	Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Is- rael: I have broken the yoke of the king of Baby- lon.
<br>3	As yet two years of days, and I will cause all the vessels of the house of the Lord to be brought back into this place, which Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon took away from this place, and car- ried them to Babylon.
<br>4	And I will bring back to this place Jecho- nias the son of Joakim king of Juda, and all the
<br> 
<br>captives of Juda, that are gone to Babylon, saith the Lord: for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.
<br>5	And Jeremias the prophet said to Hananias the prophet in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the Lord:
<br>6	And Jeremias the prophet said: Amen, the Lord do so: the Lord perform thy words, which thou hast prophesied: that the vessels may be brought again into the house of the Lord, and all the captives may return out of Babylon to this place.
<br>7	Nevertheless hear this word that I speak in thy ears, and in the ears of all the people:
<br>8	The prophets that have been before me, and before thee from the beginning, and have proph- esied concerning many countries, and concerning great kingdoms, of war, and of affliction, and of famine.
<br>9	The prophet that prophesied peace: when his word shall come to pass, the prophet shall be known, whom the hath sent in truth.
<br>10	And Hananias the prophet took the chain from the neck of Jeremias the prophet, and broke it.
<br>11	And Hananias spoke in the presence of all the people, saying: Thus saith the Lord: Even so will I break the yoke of Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon after two full years from off the neck of all the nations.
<br>12	And Jeremias the prophet went his way. And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias, after that Hananias the prophet had broken the chain from off the neck of Jeremias the prophet, saying:
<br>13	Go, and tell Hananias: Thus saith the Lord: Thou hast broken chains of wood, and thou shalt make for them chains of iron.
<br>14	For thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>all these nations, to serve Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and they shall serve him: moreover also I have given him the beasts of the earth.
<br>15	And Jeremias the prophet said to Hananias the prophet: Hear now, Hananias: the Lord hath not sent thee, and thou hast made this people to trust in a lie.
<br>16	Therefore thus saith the Lord: Behold I will send thee away from off the face of the earth: this year shalt thou die: for thou hast spoken against the Lord.
<br>17	And Hananias the prophet died in that year, in the seventh month.
<br>
<br>Chapter 29
<br>Now these are the words of the letter which Jeremias the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the residue of the ancients that were carried into cap- tivity, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people, whom Nabuchodonosor had carried away from Jerusalem to Babylon:
<br>2	After that Jechonias the king, and the queen, and the eunuchs, and the princes of Juda, and of Jerusalem, and the craftsmen, and the en- gravers were departed out of Jerusalem:
<br>3	By the hand of Elasa the son of Saphan, and Gamarias the son of Helcias, whom Sedecias king of Juda sent to Babylon to Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, saying:
<br>4	Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Is- rael, to all that are carried away captives, whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem to Babylon:
<br>5	Build ye houses, and dwell in them: and plant orchards, and eat the fruit of them.
<br>6	Take ye wives, and beget sons and daugh- ters: and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, and let them bear sons
<br> 
<br>and daughters: and be ye multiplied there, and be not few in number.
<br>7	And seek the peace of the city, to which I have caused you to be carried away captives; and pray to the Lord for it: for in the peace thereof shall be your peace.
<br>8	For thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Let not your prophets that are in the midst of you, and your diviners deceive you: and give no heed to your dreams which you dream:
<br>9	For they prophesy falsely to you in my name: and I have not sent them, saith the Lord.
<br>10	For thus saith the Lord: When the seventy years shall begin to be accomplished in Babylon, I will visit you: and I will perform my good word in your favour, to bring you again to this place. 11 For I know the thoughts that I think to- wards you, saith the Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of affliction, to give you an end and pa-
<br>tience.
<br>12	And you shall call upon me, and you shall go.   and you shall pray to me, and I will hear you.
<br>13	You shall seek me, and shall find me: when you shall seek me with all your heart.
<br>14	And I will be found by you, saith the Lord: and I will bring back your captivity, and I will gather you out of all nations, and from all the places to which I have driven you out, saith the Lord: and I will bring you back from the place to which I caused you to be carried away captive.
<br>15	Because you have said: The Lord hath raised us up prophets in Babylon:
<br>16	For thus saith the Lord to the king that sitteth upon the throne of David, and to all the people that dwell in this city, to your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity. 17 Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Behold I will send upon them the sword, and the famine, and the pestilence: and I will make them like bad figs
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>that cannot be eaten, because they are very bad. 18 And I will persecute them with the sword, and with famine, and with the pestilence: and I will give them up unto affliction to all the king- doms of the earth: to be a curse, and an aston- ishment, and a hissing, and a reproach to all the
<br>nations to which I have driven them out:
<br>19 Because they have not hearkened to my words, saith the Lord: which I sent to them by my servants the prophets, rising by night, and sending: and you have not heard, saith the Lord. 20 Hear ye therefore the word of the Lord, all ye of the captivity, whom I have sent out from
<br>Jerusalem to Babylon.
<br>21	Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel, to Achab the son of Colias, and to Sede- cias the son of Maasias, who prophesy unto you in my name falsely: Behold I will deliver them up into the hands of Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon: and he shall kill them before your eyes.
<br>22	And of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Juda, that are in Babylon, saying: The Lord make thee like Sedecias, and like Achab, whom the king of Babylon fried in the fire:
<br>23	Because they have acted folly in Israel, and have committed adultery with the wives of their friends, and have spoken lying words in my name, which I commanded them not: I am the judge and the witness, saith the Lord.
<br>24	And to Semeias the Nehelamite thou shalt say:
<br>25	Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Is- rael: Because thou hast sent letters in thy name to all the people that are in Jerusalem, and to Sophonias the son of Maasias the priest, and to all the priests, saying:
<br>26	The Lord hath made thee priest instead of Joiada the priest, that thou shouldst be ruler
<br> 
<br>in the house of the Lord, over every man that raveth and prophesieth, to put him in the stocks, and into prison.
<br>27	And now why hast thou not rebuked Jeremias the Anathothite, who prophesieth to you?
<br>28	For he hath also sent to us in Babylon, saying: It is a long time: build ye houses, and dwell in them: and plant gardens, and eat the fruits of them.
<br>29	So Sophonias the priest read this letter, in the hearing of Jeremias the prophet.
<br>30	And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias, saying:
<br>31	Send to all them of the captivity, saying: Thus saith the Lord to Semeias the Nehelamite: Because Semeias hath prophesied to you, and I sent him not: and hath caused you to trust in a lie:
<br>32	Therefore thus saith the Lord: behold I will visit upon Semeias the Nehelamite, and upon his seed: he shall not have a man to sit in the midst of this people, and he shall not see the good that I will do to my people, saith the Lord: because he hath spoken treason against the Lord.
<br>
<br>Chapter 30
<br>
<br>This is the word that came to Jeremias from the Lord, saying:
<br>2	Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel, say- ing: Write thee all the words that I have spoken to thee, in a book.
<br>3	For behold the days come, saith the Lord, and I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Juda, saith the Lord: and I will cause them to return to the land which I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>4	And these are the words that the Lord hath spoken to Israel and to Juda:
<br>5	For thus saith the Lord: We have heard a voice of terror: there is fear and no peace.
<br>6	Ask ye, and see if a man bear children? why then have I seen every man with his hands on his loins, like a woman in labour, and all faces are turned yellow?
<br>7	Alas, for that day is great, neither is there the like to it; and it is the time of tribulation to Jacob, but he shall be saved out of it.
<br>8	And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst his bands: and strangers shall no more rule over him:
<br>9	But they shall serve the Lord their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up to them. 10 Therefore fear thou not, my servant Jacob, saith the Lord, neither be dismayed, O Israel: for behold, I will save thee from a country afar off, and thy seed from the land of their captiv- ity: and Jacob shall return, and be at rest, and abound with all good things, and there shall be
<br>none whom he may fear:
<br>11	For I am with thee, saith the Lord, to save thee: for I will utterly consume all the nations, among which I have scattered thee: but I will not utterly consume thee: but I will chastise thee in judgment, that thou mayst not seem to thyself innocent.
<br>12	For thus saith the Lord: Thy bruise is in- curable, thy wound is very grievous.
<br>13	There is none to judge thy judgment to bind it up: thou hast no healing medicines.
<br>14	All thy lovers have forgotten thee, and will not seek after thee: for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with cruel chastisement: by reason of the multitude of thy iniquities, thy sins are hardened.
<br>15	Why criest thou for thy affliction? thy sor-
<br> 
<br>row is incurable: for the multitude of thy iniq- uity, and for thy hardened sins I have done these things to thee.
<br>16	Therefore all they that devour thee, shall be devoured: and all thy enemies shall be carried into captivity: and they that waste thee shall be wasted, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.
<br>17	For I will close up thy scar, and will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the Lord. Because they have called thee, O Sion, an outcast: This is she that hath none to seek after her.
<br>18	Thus saith the Lord: Behold I will bring back the captivity of the pavilions of Jacob, and will have pity on his houses, and the city shall be built in her high place, and the temple shall be founded according to the order thereof.
<br>19	And out of them shall come forth praise, and the voice of them that play: and I will multi- ply them, and they shall not be made few: and I will glorify them, and they shall not be lessened. 20 And their children shall be as from the be- ginning, and their assembly shall be permanent before me: and I will visit against all that afflict
<br>them.
<br>21	And their leader shall be of themselves: and their prince shall come forth from the midst of them: and I will bring him near, and he shall come to me: for who is this that setteth his heart to approach to me, saith the Lord?
<br>22	And you shall be my people: and I will be your God.
<br>23	Behold the whirlwind of the Lord, his fury going forth, a violent storm, it shall rest upon the head of the wicked.
<br>24	The Lord will not turn away the wrath of his indignation, till he have executed and per- formed the thought of his heart: in the latter days you shall understand these things.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 31
<br>At that time, saith the Lord, I will be the God of all the families of Israel, and they shall be my people.
<br>2	Thus saith the Lord: The people that were left and escaped from the sword, found grace in the desert: Israel shall go to his rest.
<br>3	The Lord hath appeared from afar to me. Yea I have loved thee with an everlasting love, therefore have I drawn thee, taking pity on thee. 4 And I will build thee again, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of Israel: thou shalt again be adorned with thy timbrels, and shalt go forth in
<br>the dances of them that make merry.
<br>5 Thou shalt yet plant vineyards in the moun- tains of Samaria: the planters shall plant, and they shall not gather the vintage before the time. 6 For there shall be a day, in which the watch- men on mount Ephraim, shall cry: Arise, and let
<br>us go up to Sion to the Lord our God.
<br>7	For thus saith the Lord: Rejoice ye in the joy of Jacob, and neigh before the head of the Gentiles: shout ye, and sing, and say: Save, O Lord, thy people, the remnant of Israel.
<br>8	Behold I will bring them from the north country, and will gather them from the ends of the earth and among them shall be the blind, and the lame, the woman with child, and she that is bringing forth, together, a great company of them returning hither.
<br>9	They shall come with weeping: and I will bring them back in mercy: and I will bring them through the torrents of waters in a right way, and they shall not stumble in it: for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn.
<br>10	Hear the word of the Lord, O ye nations, and declare it in the islands that are afar off, and say: He that scattered Israel will gather him: and he will keep him as the shepherd doth his
<br> 
<br>flock.
<br>11	For the Lord hath redeemed Jacob, and delivered him out of the hand of one that was mightier than he.
<br>12	And they shall come, and shall give praise in mount Sion: and they shall flow together to the good things of the Lord, for the corn, and wine, and oil, and the increase of cattle and herds, and their soul shall be as a watered gar- den, and they shall be hungry no more.
<br>13	Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, the young men and old men together: and I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them joyful after their sorrow.
<br>14	And I will fill the soul of the priests with fatness: and my people shall be filled with my good things, saith the Lord.
<br>15	Thus saith the Lord: A voice was heard on high of lamentation, of mourning, and weeping, of Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted for them, because they are not. 16 Thus saith the Lord: Let thy voice cease from weeping, and thy eyes tears: for there is a reward for thy work, saith the Lord: and they
<br>shall return out of the land of the enemy.
<br>17	And there is hope for thy last end, saith the Lord: and the children shall return to their own borders.
<br>18	Hearing I heard Ephraim when he went into captivity: thou hast chastised me, and I was instructed, as a young bullock unaccustomed to the yoke. Convert me, and I shall be converted, for thou art the Lord my God.
<br>19	For after thou didst convert me, I did penance: and after thou didst shew unto me, I struck my thigh: I am confounded and ashamed, because I have borne the reproach of my youth. 20 Surely Ephraim is an honourable son to me, surely he is a tender child: for since I spoke of him, I will still remember him. Therefore are
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>my bowels troubled for him: pitying I will pity him, saith the Lord.
<br>21	Set thee up a watchtower, make to thee bitterness: direct thy heart into the right way, wherein thou hast walked: return, O virgin of Israel, return to these thy cities.
<br>22	How long wilt thou be dissolute in deli- ciousness, O wandering daughter? for the Lord hath created a new thing upon the earth: A WOMAN SHALL COMPASS A MAN.
<br>23	Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: As yet shall they say this word in the land of Juda, and in the cities thereof, when I shall bring back their captivity: The Lord bless thee, the beauty of justice, the holy mountain.
<br>24	And Juda and all his cities shall dwell therein together: the husbandman and they that drive the flocks.
<br>25	For I have inebriated the weary soul: and I have filled every hungry soul.
<br>26	Upon this I was as it were awaked out of a sleep, and I saw, and my sleep was sweet to me. 27 Behold the days come, saith the Lord: and
<br>I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Juda with the seed of men, and with the seed of beasts.
<br>28	And as I have watched over them, to pluck up, and to throw down, and to scatter, and de- stroy, and afflict: so will I watch over them, to build up, and to plant them, saith the Lord.
<br>29	In those days they shall say no more: The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the teeth of the children are set on edge.
<br>30	But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that shall eat the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge.
<br>31	Behold the days shall come, saith the Lord, and I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Juda:
<br>32	Not according to the covenant which I
<br> 
<br>made with their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, the covenant which they made void, and I had dominion over them, saith the Lord.
<br>33	But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel, after those days, saith the Lord: I will give my law in their bowels, and I will write it in their heart: and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
<br>34	And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, say- ing: Know the Lord: for all shall know me from the least of them even to the greatest, saith the Lord: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.
<br>35	Thus saith the Lord, who giveth the sun for the light of the day, the order of the moon and of the stars, for the light of the night: who stirreth up the sea, and the waves thereof roar, the Lord of hosts is his name.
<br>36	If these ordinances shall fail before me, saith the Lord: then also the seed of Israel shall fail, so as not to be a nation before me for ever. 37 Thus saith the Lord: If the heavens above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I also will cast away all the seed of Israel, for all that they have done,
<br>saith the Lord.
<br>38	Behold the days come, saith the Lord, that the city shall be built to the Lord from the tower of Hanameel even to the gate of the corner.
<br>39	And the measuring line shall go out farther in his sight upon the hill Gareb: and it shall compass Goatha,
<br>40	And the whole valley of dead bodies, and of ashes, and all the country of death, even to the torrent Cedron, and to the corner of the horse gate towards the east, the Holy of the Lord: it shall not be plucked up, and it shall not be de- stroyed any more for ever.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 32
<br>The word that came to Jeremias from the Lord in the tenth year of Sedecias king of Juda: the same is the eighteenth year of Nabuchodonosor. 2 At that time the army of the king of Babylon besieged Jerusalem: and Jeremias the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison, which
<br>was in the house of the king of Juda.
<br>3	For Sedecias king of Juda had shut him up, saying: Why dost thou prophesy, saying: Thus saith the Lord: Behold I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it?
<br>4	And Sedecias king of Juda shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans: but he shall be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon: and he shall speak to him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall see his eyes.
<br>5	And he shall lead Sedecias to Babylon: and he shall be there till I visit him, saith the Lord. But if you will fight against the Chaldeans, you shall have no success.
<br>6	And Jeremias said: The word of the Lord came to me, saying:
<br>7	Behold, Hanameel the son of Sellum thy cousin shall come to thee, saying: Buy thee my field, which is in Anathoth, for it is thy right to buy it, being next akin.
<br>8	And Hanameel my uncle’s son came to me, according to the word of the Lord, to the entry of the prison, and said to me: Buy my field, which is in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin: for the right of inheritance is thine, and thou art next of kin to possess it. And I understood that this was the word of the Lord.
<br>9	And I bought the field of Hanameel my un- cle’s son, that is in Anathoth: and I weighed him the money, seven staters, and ten pieces of silver. 10 And I wrote it in a book and sealed it, and
<br> 
<br>took witnesses: and I weighed him the money in the balances.
<br>11 And I took the deed of the purchase that was sealed, and the stipulations, and the ratifi- cations with the seals that were on the outside. 12 And I gave the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neri the son of Maasias in the sight of Hanameel my uncle’s son, in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase, and before all the Jews that sat in the
<br>court of the prison.
<br>13 And I charged Baruch before them, saying: 14 Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Take these writings, this deed of the pur- chase that is sealed up, and this deed that is open: and put them in an earthen vessel, that
<br>they may continue many days.
<br>15	For thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Houses, and fields, and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land.
<br>16	And after I had delivered the deed of pur- chase to Baruch the son of Neri, I prayed to the Lord, saying:
<br>17	Alas, alas, alas, O Lord God, behold thou hast made heaven and earth by thy great power, and thy stretched out arm: no word shall be hard to thee:
<br>18	Thou shewest mercy unto thousands, and returnest the iniquity of the fathers into the bo- som of their children after them: O most mighty, great, and powerful, the Lord of hosts is thy name.
<br>19	Great in counsel, and incomprehensible in thought: whose eyes are open upon all the ways of the children of Adam, to render unto every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his devices.
<br>20	Who hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt even until this day, and in Israel, and amongst men, and hast made thee a name as at
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>this day.
<br>21	And hast brought forth thy people Israel, out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and a stretched out arm, and with great terror.
<br>22	And hast given them this land which thou didst swear to their fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey.
<br>23	And they came in, and possessed it: but they obeyed not thy voice, and they walked not in thy law: and they did not any of those things that thou didst command them to do, and all these evils are come upon them.
<br>24	Behold works are built up against the city to take it: and the city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans, who fight against it, by the sword, and the famine, and the pestilence: and what thou hast spoken, is all come to pass, as thou thyself seest.
<br>25	And sayest thou to me, O Lord God: Buy a field for money, and take witnesses, whereas the city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans?
<br>26	And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias, saying:
<br>27	Behold I am the Lord the God of all flesh: shall any thing be hard for me?
<br>28	Therefore thus saith the Lord: Behold I will deliver this city into the hands of the Chaldeans, and into the hands of the king of Babylon, and they shall take it.
<br>29	And the Chaldeans that fight against this city, shall come and set it on fire, and burn it, with the houses upon whose roofs they offered sacrifice to Baal, and poured out drink offerings to strange gods, to provoke me to wrath.
<br>30	For the children of Israel, and the children of Juda, have continually done evil in my eyes from their youth: the children of Israel who even till now provoke me with the work of their hands, saith the Lord.
<br> 
<br>31	For this city hath been to me a provocation and indignation from the day that they built it, until this day, in which it shall be taken out of my sight.
<br>32	Because of all the evil of the children of Is- rael, and of the children of Juda, which they have done, provoking me to wrath, they and their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets, the men of Juda, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
<br>33	And they have turned their backs to me, and not their faces: when I taught them early in the morning, and instructed them, and they would not hearken to receive instruction.
<br>34	And they have set their idols in the house, in which my name is called upon, to defile it.
<br>35	And they have built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Ennom, to consecrate their sons and their daughters to Moloch: which I commanded them not, neither entered it into my heart, that they should do this abomination, and cause Juda to sin.
<br>36	And now, therefore, thus saith the Lord the God of Israel to this city, whereof you say that it shall be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by famine, and by pestilence:
<br>37	Behold I will gather them together out of all the lands to which I have cast them out in my anger, and in my wrath, and in my great indignation: and I will bring them again into this place, and will cause them to dwell securely. 38 And they shall be my people, and I will be
<br>their God.
<br>39	And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me all days: and that it may be well with them, and with their children after them.
<br>40	And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, and will not cease to do them good:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>and I will give my fear in their heart, that they may not revolt from me.
<br>41	And I will rejoice over them, when I shall do them good: and I will plant them in this land in truth, with my whole heart, and with all my soul.
<br>42	For thus saith the Lord: As I have brought upon this people all this great evil: so will I bring upon them all the good that I now speak to them.
<br>43	And fields shall be purchased in this land: whereof you say that it is desolate, because there remaineth neither man nor beast, and it is given into the hands of the Chaldeans.
<br>44	Fields shall be bought for money, and deeds shall be written, and sealed, and witnesses shall be taken, in the land of Benjamin, and round about Jerusalem, in the cities of Juda, and in the cities on the mountains, and in the cities of the plains, and in the cities that are towards the south: for I will bring back their captivity, saith the Lord.
<br>
<br>Chapter 33
<br>And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias the second time, while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison, saying:
<br>2	Thus saith the Lord, who will do, and will form it, and prepare it, the Lord is his name.
<br>3	Cry to me and I will hear thee: and I will shew thee great things, and sure things which thou knowest not.
<br>4	For thus saith the Lord the God of Israel to the houses of this city, and to the houses of the king of Juda, which are destroyed, and to the bulwarks, and to the sword.
<br>5	Of them that come to fight with the Chaldeans, and to fill them with the dead bodies
<br> 
<br>of the men whom I have slain in my wrath, and in my indignation, hiding my face from this city because of all their wickedness.
<br>6	Behold I will close their wounds and give them health, and I will cure them: and I will reveal to them the prayer of peace and truth.
<br>7	And I will bring back the captivity of Juda, and the captivity of Jerusalem: and I will build them as from the beginning.
<br>8	And I will cleanse them from all their iniq- uity, whereby they have sinned against me: and I will forgive all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned against me, and despised me.
<br>9	And it shall be to me a name, and a joy, and a praise, and a gladness before all the nations of the earth, that shall hear of all the good things which I will do to them: and they shall fear and be troubled for all the good things, and for all the peace that I will make for them.
<br>10	Thus saith the Lord: There shall be heard again in this place (which you say is desolate, because there is neither man nor beast: in the cities of Juda, and without Jerusalem, which are desolate without man, and without inhabitant, and without beast)
<br>11	The voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that shall say: Give ye glory to the Lord of hosts, for the Lord is good, for his mercy endureth for ever: and of them that shall bring their vows into the house of the Lord: for I will bring back the captivity of the land as at the first, saith the Lord.
<br>12	Thus saith the Lord of hosts: There shall be again in this place that is desolate without man, and without beast, and in all the cities thereof, an habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down.
<br>13	And in the cities on the mountains, and in the cities of the plains, and in the cities that are
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>towards the south: and in the land of Benjamin, and round about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Juda shall the flocks pass again under the hand of him that numbereth them, saith the Lord.
<br>14	Behold the days come, saith the Lord, that I will perform the good word that I have spoken to the house of Israel, and to the house of Juda. 15 In those days, and at that time, I will make the bud of justice to spring forth unto David, and
<br>he shall do judgment and justice in the earth.
<br>16	In those days shall Juda be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell securely: and this is the name that they shall call him, The Lord our just one.
<br>17	For thus saith the Lord: There shall not be cut off from David a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel.
<br>18	Neither shall there be cut off from the priests and Levites a man before my face to of- fer holocausts, and to burn sacrifices, and to kill victims continually.
<br>19	And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias, saying:
<br>20	Thus saith the Lord: if my covenant, with the day can be made void, and my covenant with the night, that there should not be day and night in their season:
<br>21	Also my covenant with David my servant may be made void, that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne, and with the Levites and priests my ministers.
<br>22	As the stars of heaven cannot be numbered, nor the sand of the sea be measured: so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites my ministers.
<br>23	And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias, saying:
<br>24	Hast thou not seen what this people hath spoken, saying: The two families which the Lord had chosen, are cast off: and they have despised
<br> 
<br>my people, so that it is no more a nation before them?
<br>25	Thus saith the Lord. If I have not set my covenant between day and night, and laws to heaven and earth:
<br>26	Surely I will also cast off the seed of Jacob, and of David my servant, so as not to take any of his seed to be rulers of the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will bring back their cap- tivity, and will have mercy on them.
<br>
<br>Chapter 34
<br>The word that came to Jeremias from the Lord, when Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth, that were under the power of his hand, and all the people fought against Jerusalem and against all the cities thereof, saying:
<br>2	Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel: Go, and speak to Sedecias king of Juda, and say to him: Thus saith the Lord: Behold I will deliver this city into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.
<br>3	And thou shalt not escape out of his hand: but thou shalt surely be taken, and thou shalt be delivered into his hand: and thy eyes shall see the eyes of the king of Babylon, and his mouth shall speak with thy mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon.
<br>4	Yet hear the word of the Lord, O Sedecias king of Juda: Thus saith the Lord to thee: Thou shalt not die by the sword.
<br>5	But thou shalt die in peace, and according to the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings that were before thee, so shall they burn thee: and they shall mourn for thee, saying: Alas, Lord: for I have spoken the word, saith the Lord.
<br>6	And Jeremias the prophet spoke all these
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>words to Sedecias the king of Juda in Jerusalem. 7 And the army of the king of Babylon fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Juda that were left, against Lachis, and against Azecha: for these remained of the cities of Juda,
<br>fenced cities.
<br>8	The word that came to Jeremias from the Lord, after that king Sedecias had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem mak- ing a proclamation:
<br>9	That every man should let his manservant, and every man his maidservant, being Hebrew man or a Hebrew woman, go free: and that they should not lord it over them, to wit, over the Jews their brethren.
<br>10	And all the princes, and all the people who entered into the covenant, heard that every man should let his manservant, and every man his maidservant go free, and should no more have dominion over them: and they obeyed, and let them go free.
<br>11	But afterwards they turned: and brought back again their servants and their handmaids, whom they had let go free, and brought them into subjection as menservants and maidser- vants.
<br>12	And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias from the Lord, saying:
<br>13	Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying:
<br>14	At the end of seven years, let ye go every man his brother being a Hebrew, who hath been sold to thee, so he shall serve thee six years: and thou shalt let him go free from thee: and your fa- thers did not hearken to me, nor did they incline their ear.
<br>15	And you turned to day, and did that which was right in my eyes, in proclaiming liberty every
<br> 
<br>one to his brother: and you made a covenant in my sight, in the house upon which my name is invocated.
<br>16	And you are fallen back, and have defiled my name: and you have brought back again every man his manservant, and every man his maidservant, whom you had let go free, and set at liberty: and you have brought them into sub- jection to be your servants and handmaids.
<br>17	Therefore thus saith the Lord: You have not hearkened to me, in proclaiming liberty ev- ery man to his brother and every man to his friend: behold I proclaim a liberty for you, saith the Lord, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine: and I will cause you to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth.
<br>18	And I will give the men that have trans- gressed my covenant, and have not performed the words of the covenant which they agreed to in my presence, when they cut the calf in two and passed between the parts thereof:
<br>19	The princes of Juda, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land that passed between the parts of the calf:
<br>20	And I will give them into the hands of their enemies, and into the hands of them that seek their life: and their dead bodies shall be for meat to the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the earth.
<br>21	And Sedecias the king of Juda, and his princes, I will give into the hands of their ene- mies, and into the hands of them that seek their lives, and into the hands of the armies of the king of Babylon, which are gone from you.
<br>22	Behold I will command, saith the Lord, and I will bring them again to this city, and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire: and I will make the cities of Juda a desolation, without an inhabitant.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 35
<br>The word that came to Jeremias from the Lord in the days of Joakim the son of Josias king of Juda, saying:
<br>2	Go to the house of the Rechabites: and speak to them, and bring them into the house of the Lord, into one of the chambers of the trea- sures, and thou shalt give them wine to drink.
<br>3	And I took Jezonias the son of Jeremias the son of Habsanias, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites.
<br>4	And I brought them into the house of the Lord, to the treasure house of the sons of Hanan, the son of Jegedelias the man of God, which was by the treasure house of the princes, above the treasure of Maasias the son of Sellum, who was keeper of the entry.
<br>5	And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of wine, and cups: and I said to them: Drink ye wine.
<br>6	And they answered : We will not drink wine: because Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, saying: You shall drink no wine, neither you, nor your children, for ever:
<br>7	Neither shall ye build houses, nor sow reed, nor plant vineyards, nor have any: but you shall dwell in tents all your days, that you may live many days upon the face of the earth, in which you are strangers.
<br>8	Therefore we have obeyed the voice of Jon- adab the son of Rechab, our father, in all things that he commanded us: so as to drink no wine all our days: neither we, nor our wives, nor our sons, nor our daughters:
<br>9	Nor to build houses to dwell in, nor to have vineyard, or field, or seed:
<br>10	But we have dwelt in tents, and have been obedient according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.
<br> 
<br>11	But when Nabuchodonosor king of Baby- lon came up to our land, we said: Come, let us go into Jerusalem from the face of the army of the Chaldeans, and from the face of the army of Syria: and we have remained in Jerusalem.
<br>12	And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias, saying:
<br>13	Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel:    Go, and say to the men of Juda, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem: Will you not receive instruction, to obey my words, saith the Lord?
<br>14	The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, by which he commanded his sons not to drink wine, have prevailed: and they have drunk none to this day, because they have obeyed the com- mandment of their father: but I have spoken to you, rising early and speaking, and you have not obeyed me.
<br>15	And I have sent to you all my servants the prophets, rising early, and sending and saying: Return ye every man from his wicked way, and make your ways good: and follow not strange gods, nor worship them, and you shall dwell in the land, which I gave you and your fathers: and you have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened to me.
<br>16	So the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have constantly kept the commandment of their father, which he commanded them: but this peo- ple hath not obeyed me.
<br>17	Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Behold I will bring upon Juda, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them, because I have spoken to them, and they have not heard: I have called to them, and they have not answered me.
<br>18	And Jeremias said to the house of the Rech- abites: Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Israel: Because you have obeyed the command- ment of Jonadab your father, and have kept all his precepts, and have done all that he com- manded you:
<br>19	Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: There shall not be wanting a man of the race of Jonadab the son of Rechab, stand- ing before me for ever.
<br>
<br>Chapter 36
<br>And it came to pass in the fourth year of Joakim the son of Josias king of Juda, that this word came to Jeremias by the Lord, saying:
<br>2	Take thee a roll of a book, and thou shalt write in it all the words that I have spoken to thee against Israel and Juda, and against all the nations from the day that I spoke to thee, from the days of Josias even to this day.
<br>3	If so be, when the house of Juda shall hear all the evils that I purpose to do unto them, that they may return every man from his wicked way: and I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin.
<br>4	So Jeremias called Baruch the son of Nerias: and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremias all the words of the Lord, which he spoke to him, upon the roll of a book.
<br>5	And Jeremias commanded Baruch, saying: I am shut up, and cannot go into the house of the Lord.
<br>6	Go thou in therefore, and read out of the vol- ume, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of the Lord, in the hearing of all the people in the house of the Lord on the fasting day: and also thou shalt read them in the hear- ing of all Juda that come out of their cities:
<br>7	If so be they may present their supplication before the Lord, and may return every one from his wicked way: for great is the wrath and indig-
<br> 
<br>nation which the Lord hath pronounced against this people.
<br>8	And Baruch the son of Nerias did accord- ing to all that Jeremias the prophet ,had com- manded him, reading out of the volume the words of the Lord in the house of the Lord.
<br>9	And it came to pass in the fifth year of Joakim the son of Josias king of Juda, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a fast before the Lord to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people that were come together out of the cities of Juda to Jerusalem.
<br>10	And Baruch read out of the volume the words of Jeremias in the house of the Lord, in the treasury of Gamarias the son of Saphan the scribe, in the upper court, in the entry of the new gate of the house of the Lord, in the hearing of all the people.
<br>11	And when Micheas the son of Gamarias the son of Saphan had heard out of the book all the words of the Lord,
<br>12	He went down into the king’s house to the secretary’s chamber: and behold all the princes sat there, Elisama the scribe, and Dalaias the son of Semeias, and Elnathan the son of Achobor, and Gamarias the son of Saphan, and Sedecias the son of Hananias, and all the princes.
<br>13	And Micheas told them all the words that he had heard when Baruch read out of the vol- ume in the hearing of the people.
<br>14	Therefore all the princes sent Judi the son of Nathanias, the son of Selemias, the son of Chusi, to Baruch, saying: Take in thy hand the volume in which thou hast read in the hearing of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Nerias took the volume in his hand, and came to them.
<br>15	And they said to him: Sit down and read these things in our hearing. And Baruch read in their hearing.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>16	And when they had heard all the words, they looked upon one another with astonish- ment, and they said to Baruch: We must tell the king all these words.
<br>17	And they asked him, saying: Tell us how didst thou write all these words from his mouth. 18 And Baruch said to them: With his mouth he pronounced all these words as if he were read-
<br>ing to me: and I wrote in a volume with ink.
<br>19	And the princes said to Baruch: Go, and hide thee, both thou and Jeremias, and let no man know where you are.
<br>20	And they went in to the king into the court: but they laid up the volume in the chamber of Elisama the scribe: and they told all the words in the hearing of the king.
<br>21	And the king sent Judi that he should take the volume: who bringing it out of the chamber of Elisama the scribe, read it in the hearing of the king, and of all the princes that stood about the king.
<br>22	Now the king sat in the winter house, in the ninth month: and there was a hearth before him full of burning coals.
<br>23	And when Judi had read three or four pages, he cut it with the penknife, and he cast it into the fire, that was upon the hearth, till all the volume was consumed with the fire that was on the hearth.
<br>24	And the king and all his servants that heard all these words were not afraid, nor did they rend their garments.
<br>25	But yet Elnathan, and Dalaias, and Gamarias spoke to the king, not to burn the book: and he heard them not.
<br>26	And the king commanded Jeremiel the son of Amelech, and Saraias the son of Ezriel, and Selemias the son of Abdeel, to take up Baruch the scribe, and Jeremias the prophet: but the Lord hid them.
<br> 
<br>27	And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias the prophet, after that the king had burnt the volume, and the words that Baruch had written from the mouth of Jeremias, saying:
<br>28	Take thee again another volume: and write in it all the former words that were in the first volume which Joakim the king of Juda both burnt.
<br>29	And thou shalt say to Joakim the king of Juda: Thus saith the Lord: Thou hast burnt that volume, saying: Why hast thou written therein, and said: The king of Babylon shall come speedily, and shall lay waste this land: and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast?
<br>30	Therefore thus saith the Lord against Joakim the king of Juda: He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David: and his dead body shall be cast out to the heat by day, and to the frost by night.
<br>31	And I will punish him, and his seed and his servants, for their iniquities, and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Juda all the evil that I have pronounced against them, but they have not heard.
<br>32	And Jeremias took another volume, and gave it to Baruch the son of Nerias the scribe: who wrote in it from the mouth of Jeremias all the words of the book which Joakim the king of Juda had burnt with fire: and there were added besides many more words than had been before.
<br>
<br>Chapter 37
<br>Now king Sedecias the son of Josias reigned in- stead of Jechonias the son of Joakim: whom Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon made king in the land of Juda.
<br>2	But neither he, nor his servants, nor the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>people of the land did obey the words of the Lord, that he spoke in the hand of Jeremias the prophet.
<br>3	And king Sedecias sent Juchal the son of Selemias, and Sophonias the son of Maasias the priest to Jeremias the prophet, saying: Pray to the Lord our God for us.
<br>4	Now Jeremias walked freely in the midst of the people: for they had not as yet cast him into prison. And the army of Pharao was come out of Egypt: and the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem, hearing these tidings, departed from Jerusalem.
<br>5	And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias the prophet, saying:
<br>6	Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: Thus shall you say to the king of Juda, who sent you to inquire of me: Behold the army of Pharao, which is come forth to help you, shall return into their own land, into Egypt.
<br>7	And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it with fire.
<br>8	Thus saith the Lord: Deceive not your souls, saying: The Chaldeans shall surely depart and go away from us: for they shall not go away.
<br>9	But if you should even beat all the army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there should be left of them some wounded men: they shall rise up, every man from his heart, and burn this city with fire.
<br>10	Now when the army of the Chaldeans was gone away from Jerusalem, because of Pharao’s army,
<br>11	Jeremias went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin: and to divide a possession there in the presence of the citizens,
<br>12	And when he was come to the gate of Ben- jamin, the captain of the gate, who was there in his turn, was one named Jerias, the son of Se-
<br> 
<br>lemias, the son of Hananias: and he took hold of Jeremias the prophet, saying: Thou art fleeing to the Chaldeans.
<br>13	And Jeremias answered: It is not so, I am not fleeing to the Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him: so Jerias took Jeremias and brought him to the princes.
<br>14	Wherefore the princes were angry with Jeremias, and they beat him, and cast him into the prison that was in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for he was chief over the prison.
<br>15	So Jeremias went into the house of the prison, and into the dungeon: and Jeremias re- mained there many days.
<br>16	Then Sedecias the king, sending, took him: and asked him secretly in his house, and said: Is there, thinkest thou, any word from the Lord? And Jeremias said. There is. And he said: Thou shalt be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon.
<br>17	And Jeremias said to king Sedecias: In what have I offended against thee, or thy ser- vants, or thy people, that thou hast cast me into prison?
<br>18	Where are your prophets that prophesied to you, and said: The king of Babylon shall not come against you, and against this land?
<br>19	Now therefore hear, I beseech thee, my lord the king: let my petition be accepted in thy sight: and send me not back into the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.
<br>20	Then king Sedecias commanded that Jeremias should be committed into the entry of the prison: and that they should give him daily a piece of bread, beside broth, till all the bread in the city were spent: and Jeremias remained in the entry of the prison.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 38
<br>Now Saphatias the son of Mathan, and Gedelias the son of Phassur, and Juchal the son of Se- lemias, and Phassur the son of Melchias heard the words that Jeremias spoke to all the people, saying:
<br>2	Thus saith the Lord: Whosoever shall re- main in this city, shall die by the sword, and by famine, and by pestilence: but he that shall go forth to the Chaldeans, shall live, and his life shall be safe, and he shall live.
<br>3	Thus saith the Lord: This city shall surely be delivered into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it.
<br>4	And the princes said to the king. We beseech thee that this man may be put to death: for on purpose he weakeneth the hands of the men of war, that remain in this city, and the hands of the people, speaking to them according to these words: for this man seeketh not peace to this people, but evil.
<br>5	And king Sedecias said: Behold he is in your hands: for it is not lawful for the king to deny you any thing.
<br>6	Then they took Jeremias and cast him into the dungeon of Melchias the son of Amelech, which was in the entry of the prison: and they let down Jeremias by ropes into the dungeon, wherein there was no water, but mire. And Jeremias sunk into the mire.
<br>7	Now Abdemelech the Ethiopian, an eunuch that was in the king’s house, heard that they had put Jeremias in the dungeon: but the king was sitting in the gate of Benjamin.
<br>8	And Abdemelech went out of the king’s house, and spoke to the king, saying:
<br>9	My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done against Jeremias the prophet, casting him into the dungeon to die
<br> 
<br>there with hunger, for there is no more bread in the city.
<br>10	Then the king commanded Abdemelech the Ethiopian, saying: Take from hence thirty men with thee, and draw up Jeremias the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die.
<br>11	So Abdemelech taking the men with him, went into the king’s house that was under the storehouse: and he took from thence old rags, and old rotten things, and he let them down by cords to Jeremias into the dungeon.
<br>12	And Abdemelech the Ethiopian said to Jeremias: Put these old rags and these rent and rotten things under thy arms, and upon the cords: and Jeremias did so.
<br>13	And they drew up Jeremias with the cords, and brought him forth out of the dungeon. And Jeremias remained in the entry of the prison.
<br>14	And king Sedecias sent, and took Jeremias the prophet to him to the third gate, that was in the house of the Lord: and the king said to Jeremias: I will ask thee a thing, hide nothing from me.
<br>15	Then Jeremias said to Sedecias: If I shall declare it to thee, wilt thou not put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, thou wilt not hearken to me.
<br>16	Then king Sedecias swore to Jeremias, in private, saying: As the Lord liveth, that, made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, nor will I deliver thee into the hands of these men that seek thy life.
<br>17	And Jeremias said to Sedecias: Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: If thou wilt take a resolution and go out to the princes of the king of Babylon, thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burnt with fire: and thou shalt be safe, and thy house.
<br>18	But if thou wilt not go out to the princes of the king of Babylon, this city shall be delivered
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>into the hands of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire: and thou shalt not escape out of their hand.
<br>19	And king Sedecias said to Jeremias: I am afraid because of the Jews that are fled over to the Chaldeans: lest I should be delivered into their hands, and they should abuse me.
<br>20	But Jeremias answered: They shall not de- liver thee: hearken, I beseech thee, to the word of the Lord, which I speak to the, and it shall be well with thee, and thy soul shall live.
<br>21	But if thou wilt not go forth, this is the word which the Lord hath shewn me:
<br>22	Behold all the women that are left in the house of the king of Juda, shall be brought out to the princes of the king of Babylon: and they shall say: Thy men of peace have deceived thee, and have prevailed against thee, they have plunged thy feet in the mire, and in a slippery place and they have departed from thee.
<br>23	And all thy wives, and thy children shall be brought out to the Chaldeans, and thou shalt not escape their hands, but thou shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and he shall burn this city with fire.
<br>24	Then Sedecias said to Jeremias: Let no man know these words, and thou shalt not die.
<br>25	But if the princes shall hear that I have spoken with thee, and shall come to thee, and say to thee: Tell us what thou hast said to the king, hide it not from us, and we will not kill thee: and also what the king said to thee:
<br>26	Thou shalt say to them: I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not command me to be carried back into the house of Jonathan, to die there.
<br>27	So all the princes came to Jeremias, and asked him: and he spoke to them according to all the words that the king had commanded him: and they left him: for nothing had been heard.
<br> 
<br>28	But Jeremias remained in the entry of the prison, until the day that Jerusalem was taken: and it came to pass that Jerusalem was taken.
<br>
<br>Chapter 39
<br>In the ninth year of Sedecias king of Juda, in the tenth month, came Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and all his army to Jerusalem, and they besieged it.
<br>2	And in the eleventh year of Sedecias, in the fourth month, the fifth day of the month, the city was opened.
<br>3	And all the princes of the king of Baby- lon came in, and sat in the middle gate: Neregel, Sereser, Semegarnabu, Sarsachim, Rab- sares, Neregel, Serezer, Rebmag, and all the rest of the princes of the king of Babylon.
<br>4	And when Sedecias the king of Juda and all the men of war saw them, they fled: and they went forth in the night out of the city by the way of the king’s garden, and by the gate that was between the two walls, and they went out to the way of the desert.
<br>5	But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after them: and they took Sedecias in the plain of the desert of Jericho, and when they had taken him, they brought him to Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon to Reblatha, which is in the land of Emath: and he gave judgment upon him.
<br>6	And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Sedecias, in Reblatha, before his eyes: and the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Juda.
<br>7	He also put out the eyes of Sedecias: and bound him with fetters, to be carried to Babylon. 8 And the Chaldeans burnt the king’s house, and the houses of the people with fire, and they
<br>threw down the wall of Jerusalem.
<br>9 And Nabuzardan the general of the army
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>carried away captive to Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and the fugitives that had gone over to him, and the rest of the people that remained.
<br>10	But Nabuzardan the general left some of the poor people that had nothing at all, in the land of Juda, and he gave them vineyards, and cisterns at that time.
<br>11	Now Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon had given charge to Nabuzardan the general concern- ing Jeremias, saying:
<br>12	Take him, and set thy eyes upon him, and do him no harm: but as he hath a mind, so do with him.
<br>13	Therefore Nabuzardan the general sent, and Nabuzardan, and Rabsares, and Neregel, and Sereser, and Rebmag, and all the nobles of the king of Babylon,
<br>14	Sent and took Jeremias out of the court of the prison, and committed him to Godolias the son of Ahicam the son of Saphan, that he might go home, and dwell among the people.
<br>15	But the word of the Lord came to Jeremias, when he was yet shut up in the court of the prison, saying: Go, and tell Abdemelech the Ethiopian, saying:
<br>16	Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Behold I will bring my words upon this city unto evil, and not unto good: and they shall be accomplished in thy sight in that day.
<br>17	And I will deliver thee in that day, saith the Lord: and thou shalt not be given into the hands of the men whom thou fearest:
<br>18	But delivering, I will deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword: but thy life shall be saved for thee, because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith the Lord.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 40
<br>The word that came to Jeremias from the Lord, after that Nabuzardan the general had let him go from Rama, when he had taken him, being bound with chains, among all them that were carried away from Jerusalem and Juda, and were carried to Babylon.
<br>2	And the general of the army taking Jeremias, said to him: The Lord thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place,
<br>3	And he hath brought it: and the Lord hath done as he hath said: because you have sinned against the Lord, and have not hearkened to his voice, and this word is come upon you.
<br>4	Now then behold I have loosed thee this day from the chains which were upon thy hands: if it please thee to come with me to Babylon, come: and I will set my eyes upon thee: but if it do not please thee to come with me to Babylon, stay here: behold all the land is before thee, as thou shalt choose, and whither it shall please thee to go, thither go.
<br>5	And come not with me: but dwell with Godolias the son of Ahicam the son of Saphan, whom the king of Babylon hath made governor over the cities of Juda: dwell therefore with him in the midst of the people: or whithersoever it shall please thee to go, go. And the general of the army gave him victuals and presents, and let him go.
<br>6	And Jeremias went to Godolias the son of Ahicam to Masphath: and dwelt with him in the midst of the people that were left in the land.
<br>7	And when all the captains of the army that were scattered through the countries, they and their companions, had heard that the king of Babylon had made Godolias the son of Ahicam governor of the country, and that he had com- mitted unto him men and women, and children,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>and of the poor of the land, them that had not been carried away captive to Babylon:
<br>8	They came to Godolias to Masphath: and Ismahel the son of Nathanias, and Johanan, and Jonathan, the sons of Caree, and Sareas the son of Thanehumeth, and the children of Ophi, that were of Netophathi, and Jezonias the son of Maachati, they and their men.
<br>9	And Godolias the son of Ahicam the son of Saphan swore to them and to their companions, saying: Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.
<br>10	Behold I dwell in Masphath, that I may answer the commandment of the Chaldeans that are sent to us: but as for you, gather ye the vintage, and the harvest, and the oil, and lay it up in your vessels, and abide in your cities which you hold.
<br>11	Moreover all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the children of Ammon, and in Edom, and in all the countries, when they heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judea, and that he had made Godolias the son of Ahicam the son of Saphan ruler over them:
<br>12	All the Jews, I say, returned out of all the places to which they had fled, and they came into the land of Juda to Godolias to Masphath: and they gathered wine, and a very great harvest.
<br>13	Then Johanan the son of Caree, and all the captains of the army, that had been scat- tered about in the countries, came to Godolias to Masphath.
<br>14	And they said to him: Know that Baalis the king of the children of Ammon hath sent Is- mahel the son of Nathanias to kill thee. And Godolias the son of Ahicam believed them not.
<br>15	But Johanan the son of Caree, spoke to Godolias privately in Masphath, saying: I will go, and I will kill Ismahel the son of Nathanias,
<br> 
<br>and no man shall know it, lest he kill thee, and all the Jews be scattered, that are gathered unto thee, and the remnant of Juda perish.
<br>16	And Godolias the son of Ahicam said to Johanan the son of Caree: Do not this thing: for what thou sayst of Ismahel is false.
<br>
<br>Chapter 41
<br>And it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ismahel the son of Nathanias, the son of Elisama of the royal blood, and the nobles of the king, and ten men with him, came to Godolias the son of Ahicam into Masphath: and they ate bread there together in Masphath.
<br>2	And Ismahel the son of Nathanias arose, and the ten men that were with him, and they struck Godolias the son of Ahicam, the son of Saphan with the sword, and slew him whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.
<br>3	Ismahel slew also all the Jews that were with Godolias in Masphath, and the Chaldeans that were found there, and the soldiers.
<br>4	And on the second day after he had killed Godolias, no man yet knowing it,
<br>5	There came some from Sichem, and from Silo, and from Samaria, fourscore men, with their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and mourning: and they had offerings and incense in their hand, to offer in the house of the Lord.
<br>6	And Ismahel the son of Nathanias went forth from Masphath to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and when he had met them, he said to them: Come to Godolias, the son of Ahicam.
<br>7	And when they were come to the midst of the city, Ismahel the son of Nathanias, slew them, and cast them into the midst of the pit, he and the men that were with him.
<br>8	But ten men were found among them, that
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>said to Ismahel: Kill us not: for we have stores in the field, of wheat, and barley, and oil, and honey. And he forbore, and slew them not with their brethren.
<br>9	And the pit into which Ismahel cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he slew because of Godolias, is the same that king Asa made, for fear of Baasa the king of Israel: the same did Ismahel the son of Nathanias fill with them that were slain.
<br>10	Then Ismahel carried away captive all the remnant of the people that were in Masphath: the king’s daughters, and all the people that remained in Masphath: whom Nabuzardan the general of the army had committed to Godolias the son of Ahicam. And Ismahel the son of Nathanias took them, and he departed, to go over to the children of Ammon.
<br>11	But Johanan the son of Caree, and all the captains of the fighting men that were with him, heard of the evil that Ismahel the son of Natha- nias had done.
<br>12	And taking all the men, they went out to fight against Ismahel the son of Nathanias, and they found him by the great waters that are in Gabaon.
<br>13	And when all the people that were with Ismahel, had seen Johanan the son of Caree, and all the captains of the fighting men that were with him, they rejoiced.
<br>14	And all the people whom Ismahel had taken, went back to Masphath: and they re- turned and went to Johanan the son of Caree.
<br>15	But Ismahel the son of Nathanias fled with eight men, from the face of Johanan, and went to the children of Ammon.
<br>16	Then Johanan the son of Caree, and all the captains of the soldiers that were with him, took all the remnant of the people whom they had re- covered from Ismahel the son of Nathanias, from
<br> 
<br>Masphath, after that he had slain Godolias the son of Ahicam: valiant men for war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs whom he had brought back from Gabaon.
<br>17	And they departed, and sat as sojourners in Chamaam, which is near Bethlehem: in order to go forward, and enter into Egypt,
<br>18	From the face of the Chaldeans: for they were afraid of them, because Ismahel the son of Nathanias had slain Godolias the son of Ahicam, whom the king of Babylon had made governor in the land of Juda.
<br>
<br>Chapter 42
<br>Then all the captains of the warriors, and Jo- hanan the son of Caree, and Jezonias, the son of Osaias, and the rest of the people from the least to the greatest came near:
<br>2	And they said to Jeremias the prophet: Let our supplication fall before thee: and pray thou for us to the Lord thy God for all this remnant, for we are left but a few of many, as thy eyes do behold us.
<br>3	And let the Lord thy God shew us the way by which we may walk, and the thing that we must do.
<br>4	And Jeremias the prophet said to them: I have heard you: behold I will pray to the Lord your God according to your words: and whatso- ever thing he shall answer me, I will declare it to you: and I will hide nothing from you.
<br>5	And they said to Jeremias: The Lord be witness between us of truth and faithfulness, if we do not according to every thing for which the Lord thy God shall send thee to us.
<br>6	Whether it be good or evil, we will obey the voice of the Lord our God, to whom we send thee: that it may be well with us when we shall
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>hearken to the voice of the Lord our God.
<br>7	Now after ten days, the word of the Lord came to Jeremias.
<br>8	And he called Johanan the son of Caree, and all the captains of the fighting men that were with him, and all the people from the least to the greatest.
<br>9	And he said to them: Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel, to whom you sent me, to present your supplications before him:
<br>10	If you will be quiet and remain in this land, I will build you up, and not pull you down: I will plant you, and not pluck you up: for now I am appeased for the evil that I have done to you.
<br>11	Fear not because of the king of Babylon, of whom you are greatly afraid: fear him not, saith the Lord: for I am with you, to save you, and to deliver you from his hand.
<br>12	And I will shew mercies to you, and will take pity on you, and will cause you to dwell in your own land.
<br>13	But if you say: We will not dwell in this land, neither will we hearken to the voice of the Lord our God,
<br>14	Saying: No, but we will go into the land of Egypt: where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor suffer hunger: and there we will dwell.
<br>15	For this now hear the word of the Lord, ye remnant of Juda: Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: If you set your faces to go into Egypt, and enter in to dwell there:
<br>16	The sword which you fear, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt: and the famine, whereof you are afraid, shall cleave to you in Egypt, and there you shall die.
<br>17	And all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt, to dwell there, shall die by the sword, and by famine, and by pestilence: none of them shall remain, nor escape from the face of the evil
<br> 
<br>that I will bring upon them.
<br>18	For thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: As my anger and my indignation hath been kindled against the inhabitants of Jerusalem: so shall my indignation be kindled against you, when you shall enter into Egypt, and you shall be an execration, and an astonish- ment, and a curse, and a reproach: and you shall see this place no more.
<br>19	This is the word of the Lord concerning you, O ye remnant of Juda: Go ye not into Egypt: know certainly that I have adjured you this day.
<br>20	For you have deceived your own souls: for you sent me to the Lord our God, saying: Pray for us to the Lord our God, and according to all that the Lord our God shall say to thee, so declare unto us, and we will do it.
<br>21	And now I have declared it to you this day, and you have not obeyed the voice of the Lord your God, with regard to all the things for which he hath sent me to you.
<br>22	Now therefore know certainly that you shall die by the sword, and by famine, and by pestilence in the place to which you desire to go to dwell there.
<br>
<br>Chapter 43
<br>And it came to pass, that when Jeremias had made an end of speaking to the people all the words of the Lord their God, for which the Lord their God had sent him to them, all these words: 2 Azarias the son of Osaias, and Johanan the son of Caree, and all the proud men, made an- swer, saying to Jeremias: Thou tellest a lie: the Lord our God hath not sent thee, saying: Go not
<br>into Egypt, to dwell there.
<br>3 But Baruch the son of Nerias setteth thee
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>on against us, to deliver us into the hands of the Chaldeans, to kill us, and to cause us to be carried away captives to Babylon.
<br>4	So Johanan the son of Caree, and all the cap- tains of the soldiers, and all the people, obeyed not the voice of the Lord, to remain in the land of Juda.
<br>5	But Johanan the son of Caree, and all the captains of the soldiers took all the remnant of Juda, that were returned out of all nations, to which they had before been scattered, to dwell in the land of Juda:
<br>6	Men, and   women,   and   children,   and the king’s daughters, and every soul, which Nabuzardan the general had left with Godolias the son of Ahicam the son of Saphan, and Jeremias the prophet, and Baruch the son of Ne- rias.
<br>7	And they went into the land of Egypt, for they obeyed not the voice of the Lord: and they came as far as Taphnis.
<br>8	And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias in Taphnis, saying:
<br>9	Take great stones in thy hand, and thou shalt hide them in the vault that is under the brick wall at the gate of Pharao’s house in Taph- nis: in the sight of the men of Juda.
<br>10	And thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Behold I will send, and take Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon my servant: and I will set his throne over these stones which I have hid, and he shall set his throne over them.
<br>11	And he shall come and strike the land of Egypt: such as are for death, to death: and such as are for captivity, to captivity: and such as are for the sword, to the sword.
<br>12	And he shall kindle a fire in the temples of the gods of Egypt, and he shall burn them, and he shall carry them away captives: and he
<br> 
<br>shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on his garment: and he shall go forth from thence in peace.
<br>13	And he shall break the statues of the house of the sun, that are in the land of Egypt; and the temples of the gods of Egypt he shall burn with fire.
<br>
<br>Chapter 44
<br>The word that came to Jeremias, concerning all the Jews that dwelt in the land of Egypt, dwelling in Magdal, and in Taphnis, and in Mem- phis, and in the land of Phatures, saying:
<br>2	Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: You have seen all this evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Juda: and behold they are desolate this day, and there is not an inhabitant in them:
<br>3	Because of the wickedness which they have committed, to provoke me to wrath, and to go and offer sacrifice, and worship other gods, which neither they, nor you, nor your fathers knew.
<br>4	And I sent to you all my servants the prophets, rising early, and sending, and saying: Do not commit this abominable thing, which I hate.
<br>5	But they heard not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their evil ways, and not to sacrifice to strange gods.
<br>6	Wherefore my indignation and my fury was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem: and they are turned to desolation and waste, as at this day.
<br>7	And now thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Why do you commit this great evil against your own souls, that there should die of you man and woman, child and suckling
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>out of the midst of Juda, and no remnant should be left you:
<br>8	In that you provoke me to wrath with the works of your hands, by sacrificing to other gods in the land of Egypt, into which you are come to dwell there: and that you should perish, and be a curse, and a reproach to all the nations of the earth?
<br>9	Have you forgotten the evils of your fathers, and the evils of the kings of Juda, and the evils of their wives, and your evils, and the evils of your wives, that they have done in the land of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem?
<br>10	They are not cleansed even to this day: neither have they feared, nor walked in the law of the Lord, nor in my commandments, which I set before you and your fathers.
<br>11	Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Behold I will set my face upon you for evil:  and I will destroy all Juda.
<br>12	And I will take the remnant of Juda that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt, and to dwell there; and they shall be all con- sumed in the land of Egypt: they shall fall by the sword, and by the famine: and they shall be consumed from the least even to the greatest, by the sword, and by the famine shall they die: and they shall be for an execration, and for a wonder, and for a curse, and for a reproach.
<br>13	And I will visit them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have visited Jerusalem by the sword, and by famine and by pestilence.
<br>14	And there shall be none that shall escape, and remain of the remnant of the Jews that are gone to sojourn in the land of Egypt: and that shall return into the land of Juda, to which they have a desire to return to dwell there: there shall none return but they that shall flee.
<br>15	Then all the men that knew that their wives sacrificed to other gods: and all the women
<br> 
<br>of whom there stood by a great multitude, and all the people of them that dwelt in the land of Egypt in Phatures, answered Jeremias, saying:
<br>16	As for the word which thou hast spoken to us in the name of the Lord, we will not hearken to thee:
<br>17	But we will certainly do every word that shall proceed out of our own mouth, to sacrifice to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to her, as we and our fathers have done, our kings, and our princes in the cities of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem: and we were filled with bread, and it was well with us, and we saw no evil.
<br>18	But since we left off to offer sacrifice to the queen of heaven, and to pour out frank offerings to her, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword, and by famine.
<br>19	And if we offer sacrifice to the queen of heaven, and pour out drink offerings to her: did we make cakes to worship her, to pour out drink offerings to her, without our husbands?
<br>20	And Jeremias spoke to all the people, to the men, and to the women, and to all the people which had given him that answer, saying:
<br>21	Was it not the sacrifice that you offered in the cities of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem, you and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land, which the Lord hath remembered, and hath it not en- tered into his heart?
<br>22	So that the Lord could no longer bear, be- cause of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which you have committed: therefore your land is become a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without an inhab- itant, as at this day.
<br>23	Because you have sacrificed to idols, and have sinned against the Lord: and have not obeyed the voice of the Lord, and have not
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>walked in his law, and in his commandments, and in his testimonies: therefore are these evils come upon you, as at this day.
<br>24	And Jeremias said to all the people and to all the women: Hear ye the word of the Lord, all Juda, you that dwell in the land of Egypt:
<br>25	Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel, saying: You and your wives have spoken with your mouth, and fulfilled with your hands, saying: Let us perform our vows which we have made, to offer sacrifice to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to her: you have fulfilled your vows, and have performed them in- deed.
<br>26	Therefore hear ye the word of the Lord, all Juda, you that dwell in the land of Egypt: Behold I have sworn by my great name, saith the Lord: that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Juda, in the land of Egypt, saying: The Lord God liveth.
<br>27	Behold I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and all the men of Juda that are in the land of Egypt, shall be consumed, by the sword, and by famine, till there be an end of them.
<br>28	And a few men that shall flee from the sword, shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Juda: and all the remnant of Juda that are gone into the land of Egypt to dwell there, shall know whose word shall stand, mine, or theirs.
<br>29	And this shall be a sign to you, saith the Lord, that I will punish you in this place: that you may know that my words shall be accom- plished indeed against you for evil.
<br>30	Thus saith the Lord: Behold I will deliver Pharao Nechao king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life: as I delivered Sedecias king of Juda into the land of Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon
<br> 
<br>his enemy, and that sought his life.
<br>
<br>Chapter 45
<br>The word that Jeremias the prophet spoke to Baruch the son of Nerias, when he had writ- ten these words in a book, out of the mouth of Jeremias, in the fourth year of Joakim the son of Josias king of Juda, saying:
<br>2	Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel to thee, Baruch:
<br>3	Thou hast said: Woe is me, wretch that I am, for the Lord hath added sorrow to my sor- row: I am wearied with my groans, and I find no rest.
<br>4	Thus saith the Lord: Thus shalt thou say to him: Behold, them whom I have built, I do destroy: and them whom I have planted, I do pluck up, and all this land.
<br>5	And dost thou seek great things for thyself? Seek not: for behold I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the Lord! but I will give thee thy life, and save thee in all places whithersoever thou shalt go.
<br>
<br>Chapter 46
<br>The word of the Lord that came to Jeremias the prophet against the Gentiles,
<br>2	Against Egypt, against the army of Pharao Nechao king of Egypt, which was by the river Eu- phrates in Charcamis, whom Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon defeated, in the fourth year of Joakim the son of Josias king of Juda.
<br>3	Prepare ye the shield and buckler, and go forth to battle.
<br>4	Harness the horses, and get up, ye horsemen: stand forth with helmets, furbish the spears, put on coats of mail.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>5	What then? I have seen them dismayed, and turning their backs, their valiant ones slain: they fled apace, and they looked not back: terror was round about, saith the Lord.
<br>6	Let not the swift flee away, nor the strong think to escape: they are overthrown, and fallen down, towards the north by the river Euphrates. 7 Who is this that cometh up as a flood: and
<br>his streams swell like those of rivers?
<br>8	Egypt riseth up like a flood, and the waves thereof shall be moved as rivers, and he shall say: I will go up and will cover the earth: I will destroy the city, and its inhabitants.
<br>9	Get ye up on horses, and glory in chariots, and let the valiant men come forth, the Ethiopi- ans, and the Libyans that hold the shield, and the Lydians that take, and shoot arrows.
<br>10	For this is the day of the Lord the God of hosts, a day of vengeance, that he may revenge himself of his enemies: the sword shall devour, and shall be filled, and shall be drunk with their blood: for there is a sacrifice of the Lord God of hosts in the north country, by the river Eu- phrates.
<br>11	Go up into Galaad, and take balm, O virgin daughter of Egypt: in vain dost thou multiply medicines, there shall be no cure for thee.
<br>12	The nations have heard of thy disgrace, and thy howling hath filled the land: for the strong hath stumbled against the strong, and both are fallen together.
<br>13	The word that the Lord spoke to Jeremias the prophet, how Nabuchodonosor king of Baby- lon should come and strike the land of Egypt:
<br>14	Declare ye to Egypt, and publish it in Mag- dal, and let it be known in Memphis, and in Taphnis: say ye: Stand up, and prepare thyself: for the sword shall devour all round about thee. 15 Why are thy valiant men come to noth- ing?	they stood not: because the Lord hath
<br> 
<br>overthrown them.
<br>16	He hath multiplied them that fall, and one hath fallen upon another, and they shall say: Arise, and let us return to our own people, and to the land of our nativity, from the sword of the dove.
<br>17	Call ye the name of Pharao king of Egypt, a tumult time hath brought.
<br>18	As I live, saith the King,   (whose name is the Lord of hosts,) as Thabor is among the mountains, and as Carmel by the sea, so shall he come.
<br>19	Furnish thyself to go into captivity, thou daughter inhabitant of Egypt: for Memphis shall be made desolate, and shall be forsaken and un- inhabited.
<br>20	Egypt is like a fair and beautiful heifer: there shall come from the north one that shall goad her.
<br>21	Her hirelings also that lived in the midst of her, like fatted calves are turned back, and are fled away together, and they could not stand, for the day of their slaughter is come upon them, the time of their visitation.
<br>22	Her voice shall sound like brass, for they shall hasten with an army, and with axes they shall come against her, as hewers of wood.
<br>23	They have cut down her forest, saith the Lord, which cannot be counted: they are multi- plied above locusts, and are without number.
<br>24	The daughter of Egypt is confounded, and delivered into the hand of the people of the north.
<br>25	The Lord of hosts the God of Israel hath said: Behold I will visit upon the tumult of Alexandria, and upon Pharao, and upon Egypt, and upon her gods, and upon her kings, and upon Pharao, and upon them that trust in him. 26 And I will deliver them into the hand of them that seek their lives, and into the hand of
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants: and afterwards it shall be inhabited, as in the days of old, saith the Lord. 27 And thou my servant Jacob, fear not and be not thou dismayed, O Israel: for behold I will save thee from afar off, and thy seed out of the land of thy captivity: and Jacob shall return and be at rest, and prosper: and there shall be none
<br>to terrify him.
<br>28 And thou, my servant Jacob, fear not, saith the Lord: because I am with thee, for I will con- sume all the nations to which I have cast thee out: but thee I will not consume, but I will cor- rect thee in judgment, neither will I spare thee as if thou wert innocent.
<br>
<br>Chapter 47
<br>The word of the Lord that came to Jeremias the prophet against the people of Palestine, before Pharao took Gaza.
<br>2	Thus saith the Lord: Behold there come up waters out of the north, and they shall be as an overflowing torrent, and they shall cover the land, and all that is therein, the city and the inhabitants thereof: then the men shall cry, and all the inhabitants of the land shall howl,
<br>3	At the noise of the marching of arms, and of his soldiers, at the rushing of his chariots, and the multitude of his wheels.   The fathers have not looked back to the children, for feebleness of hands,
<br>4	Because of the coming of the day, in which all the Philistines shall be laid waste, and Tyre and Sidon shall be destroyed, with all the rest of their helpers. For the Lord hath wasted the Philistines, the remnant of the isle of Cappado- cia.
<br>5	Baldness is come upon Gaza: Ascalon hath
<br> 
<br>held her peace with the remnant of their valley: how long shalt thou cut thyself?
<br>6	O thou sword of the Lord, how long wilt thou not be quiet? Go into thy scabbard, rest, and be still.
<br>7	How shall it be quiet, when the Lord hath given it a charge against Ascalon, and against the countries thereof by the sea side, and there hath made an appointment for it?
<br>
<br>Chapter 48
<br>Against Moab thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Woe to Nabo, for it is laid waste, and confounded: Cariathaim is taken: the strong city is confounded and hath trembled.
<br>2	There is no more rejoicing in Moab over Hes- ebon: they have devised evil. Come, and let us cut it off from being a nation. Therefore shalt thou in silence hold thy peace, and the sword shall follow thee.
<br>3	A voice of crying from Oronaim: waste, and great destruction.
<br>4	Moab is destroyed: proclaim a cry for her little ones.
<br>5	For by the ascent of Luith shall the mourner go up with weeping: for in the descent of Oron- aim the enemies have heard a howling of destruc- tion.
<br>6	Flee, save your lives: and be as heath in the wilderness.
<br>7	For because thou hast trusted in thy bul- warks, and in thy treasures, thou also shalt be taken: and Chamos shall go into captivity, his priests, and his princes together.
<br>8	And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape: and the valleys shall perish, and the plains shall be destroyed, for the Lord hath spoken:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>9	Give a flower to Moab, for in its flower it shall go out: and the cities thereof shall be des- olate, and uninhabited.
<br>10	Cursed be he that doth the work of the Lord deceitfully: and cursed be he that with- holdeth his sword from blood.
<br>11	Moab hath been fruitful from his youth, and hath rested upon his lees: and hath not been poured out from vessel to vessel, nor hath gone into captivity: therefore his taste hath remained in him, and his scent is not changed.
<br>12	Therefore behold the days come, saith the Lord, and I will send him men that shall order and overturn his bottles, and they shall cast him down, and shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles one against another.
<br>13	And Moab shall be ashamed of Chamos, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel, in which they trusted.
<br>14	How do you say: We are valiant and stout men in battle?
<br>15	Moab is laid waste, and they have cast down her cities: and her choice young men are gone down to the slaughter: saith the king, whose name is the Lord of hosts.
<br>16	The destruction of Moab is near to come: the calamity thereof shall come on exceeding swiftly.
<br>17	Comfort him, all you that are round about him, and all you that know his name, say: How is the strong staff broken, the beautiful rod?
<br>18	Come down from thy glory, and sit in thirst, O dwelling of the daughter of Dibon: be- cause the spoiler of Moab is come up to thee, he hath destroyed thy bulwarks.
<br>19	Stand in the way, and look out, O habi- tation of Aroer: inquire of him that fleeth: and say to him that hath escaped: What is done?
<br>20	Moab is confounded, because he is over- thrown: howl ye, and cry, tell ye it in Arnon,
<br> 
<br>that Moab is wasted.
<br>21	And judgment is come upon the plain coun- try: upon Helon, and upon Jasa, and upon Mephaath.
<br>22	And upon Dibon, and upon Nabo, and upon the house of Deblathaim,
<br>23	And upon Cariathaim, and upon Bethga- mul, and upon Bethmaon,
<br>24	And upon Carioth, and upon Bosra: and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near.
<br>25	The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith the Lord.
<br>26	Make him drunk, because he lifted up him- self against the Lord: and Moab shall dash his hand in his own vomit, and he also shall be in derision.
<br>27	For Israel hath been a derision unto them: as though thou hadst found him amongst thieves: for thy words therefore, which thou hast spoken against him, thou shalt be led away cap- tive.
<br>28	Leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, you that dwell in Moab: and be ye like the dove that maketh her nest in the mouth of the hole in the highest place.
<br>29	We have heard the pride of Moab, he is exceeding proud: his haughtiness, and his ar- rogancy, and his pride, and the loftiness of his heart.
<br>30	I know, saith the Lord, his boasting, and that the strength thereof is not according to it, neither hath it endeavoured to do according as it was able.
<br>31	Therefore will I lament for Moab, and I will cry out to all Moab, for the men of the brick wall that mourn.
<br>32	O vineyard of Sabama, I will weep for thee, with the mourning of Jazer: thy branches are gone over the sea, they are come even to the sea
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>of Jazer: the robber hath rushed in upon thy harvest and thy vintage.
<br>33	Joy and gladness is taken away from Carmel, and from the land of Moab, and I have taken away the wine out of the presses: the treader of the grapes shall not sing the accus- tomed cheerful tune.
<br>34	From the cry of Hesebon even to Eleale, and to Jasa, they have uttered their voice: from Segor to Oronaim, as a heifer of three years old: the waters also of Nemrim shall be very bad.
<br>35	And I will take away from Moab, saith the Lord, him that offereth in the high places, and that sacrificeth to his gods.
<br>36	Therefore my heart shall sound for Moab like pipes and my heart shall sound like pipes for the men of the brick wall: because he hath done more than he could, therefore they have perished.
<br>37	For every head shall be bald, and every beard shall be shaven: all hands shall be tied to- gether, and upon every back there shall be hair- cloth.
<br>38	Upon all the housetops of Moab, and in the streets thereof general mourning: because I have broken Moab as an useless vessel, saith the Lord.
<br>39	How is it overthrown, and they have howled! How hath Moab bowed down the neck, and is confounded! And Moab shall be a deri- sion, and an example to all round about him.
<br>40	Thus saith the Lord: Behold he shall fly as an eagle, and shall stretch forth his wings to Moab.
<br>41	Carioth is taken, and the strongholds are won: and the heart of the valiant men of Moab in that day shall be as the heart of a woman in labour.
<br>42	And Moab shall cease to be a people: be- cause he hath gloried against the Lord.
<br> 
<br>43	Fear, and the pit, and the snare come upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab, saith the Lord.
<br>44	He that shall flee from the fear, shall fall into the pit: and he that shall get up out of the pit, shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring upon Moab the year of their visitation, saith the Lord.
<br>45	They that fled from the snare stood in the shadow of Hesebon: but there came a fire out of Hesebon, and a flame out of the midst of Seon, and it shall devour part of Moab, and the crown of the head of the children of tumult.
<br>46	Woe to thee, Moab, thou hast persisted, O people of Chamos: for thy sons, and thy daugh- ters are taken captives.
<br>47	And I will bring back the captivity of Moab in the last days, saith the Lord. Hitherto the judgments of Moab.
<br>
<br>Chapter 49
<br>Against the children of Ammon. Thus saith the Lord: Hath Israel no sons? or hath he no heir? Why then hath Melchom inherited Gad: and his people dwelt in his cities?
<br>2	Therefore behold the days come, saith the Lord, and I will cause the noise of war to be heard in Rabbath of the children of Ammon, and it shall be destroyed into a heap, and her daughters shall be burnt with fire, and Israel shall possess them that have possessed him, saith the Lord.
<br>3	Howl, O Hesebon, for Hai is wasted. Cry, ye daughters of Rabbath, gird yourselves with haircloth: mourn and go about by the hedges: for Melchom shall be carried into captivity, his priests, and his princes together.
<br>4	Why gloriest thou in the valleys?   thy val- ley hath flowed away, O delicate daughter, that
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>hast trusted in thy treasures, and hast said: Who shall come to me?
<br>5	Behold I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord God of hosts, from all that are round about thee: and you shall be scattered every one out of one another’s sight, neither shall there be any to gather together them that flee.
<br>6	And afterwards I will cause the captives of the children of Ammon to return, saith the Lord. 7 Against Edom.  Thus saith the Lord of hosts:
<br>Is wisdom no more in Theman? counsel is per- ished from her children: their wisdom is become unprofitable.
<br>8	Flee and turn your backs, go down into the deep hole, ye inhabitants of Dedan: for I have brought the destruction of Esau upon him, the time of his visitation.
<br>9	If grapegatherers had come to thee, would they not have left a bunch? if thieves in the night, they would have taken what was enough for them.
<br>10	But I have made Esau bare, I have revealed his secrets, and he cannot be hid: his seed is laid waste, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he shall not be.
<br>11	Leave thy fatherless children: I will make them live: and thy widows shall hope in me.
<br>12	For thus saith the Lord: Behold they whose judgment was not to drink of the cup, shall cer- tainly drink: and shalt thou come off as inno- cent? thou shalt not come off as innocent, but drinking thou shalt drink.
<br>13	For I have sworn by myself, saith the Lord, that Bosra shall become a desolation, and a re- proach, and a desert, and a curse: and all her cities shall be everlasting wastes.
<br>14	I have heard a rumour from the Lord, and an ambassador is sent to the nations: Gather yourselves together, and come against her, and let us rise up to battle.
<br> 
<br>15	For behold I have made thee a little one among the nations, despicable among men.
<br>16	Thy arrogancy hath deceived thee, and the pride of thy heart: O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, and endeavourest to lay hold on the height of the hill: but though thou shouldst make thy nest as high as an eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith the Lord.
<br>17	And Edom shall be desolate: every one that shall pass by it, shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all its plagues.
<br>18	As Sodom was overthrown and Gomorrha, and the neighbours thereof, saith the Lord: there shall not a man dwell there, and there shall no son of man inhabit it.
<br>19	Behold one shall come up as a lion from the swelling of the Jordan, against the strong and beautiful: for I will make him run suddenly upon her: and who shall be the chosen one whom I may appoint over her? for who is like to me? and who shall abide me? and who is that shepherd that can withstand my countenance?
<br>20	Therefore hear ye the counsel of the Lord, which he hath taken concerning Edom: and his thoughts which he hath thought concerning the inhabitants of Theman: surely the little ones of the flock shall cast them down, of a truth they shall destroy them with their habitation.
<br>21	The earth is moved at the noise of their fall: the cry of their voice is heard in the Red Sea.
<br>22	Behold he shall come up as an eagle, and fly: and he shall spread his wings over Bosra: and in that day the heart of the valiant ones of Edom shall be as the heart of a woman in labour. 23 Against Damascus. Emath is confounded and Arphad: for they have heard very bad tid- ings, they are troubled as in the sea: through
<br>care they could not rest.
<br>24 Damascus is undone, she is put to flight,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>trembling hath seized on her: anguish and sor- rows have taken her as a woman in labour.
<br>25	How have they forsaken the city of renown, the city of joy!
<br>26	Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets: and all the men of war shall be silent in that day, saith the Lord of hosts.
<br>27	And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Dam- ascus, and it shall devour the strong holds of Benadad.
<br>28	Against Cedar and against the kingdoms of Asor, which Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon destroyed. Thus saith the Lord: Arise, and go ye up to Cedar, and waste the children of the east. 29 They shall take their tents, and their flocks: and shall carry off for themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels: and they
<br>shall call fear upon them round about.
<br>30	Flee ye, get away speedily, sit in deep holes, you that inhabit Asor, saith the Lord: for Nabu- chodonosor king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived designs against you.
<br>31	Arise, and go up to a nation that is at ease, and that dwelleth securely, saith the Lord: they have neither gates, nor bars: they dwell alone.
<br>32	And their camels shall be for a spoil and the multitude of their cattle for a booty, and I will scatter into every wind them that have their hair cut round, and I will bring destruction upon them from all their confines, saith the Lord.
<br>33	And Asor shall be a habitation for dragons, desolate for ever: no man shall abide there, nor son of man inhabit it.
<br>34	The word of the Lord that came to Jeremias the prophet against Elam, in the be- ginning of the reign of Sedecias king of Juda, saying:
<br>35	Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Behold I will break the bow of Elam, and their chief strength.
<br> 
<br>36	And I will bring upon Elam the four winds from the four quarters of heaven: and I will scat- ter them into all these winds: and there shall be no nation, to which the fugitives of Elam shall not come.
<br>37	And I will cause Elam to be afraid before their enemies, and in the sight of them that seek their life: and I will bring evil upon them, my fierce wrath, saith the Lord: and I will send the sword after them, till I consume them.
<br>38	And I will set my throne in Elam, and de- stroy kings and princes from thence, saith the Lord.
<br>39	But in the latter days I will cause the cap- tives of Elam, to return, saith the Lord.
<br>
<br>Chapter 50
<br>The word that the Lord hath spoken against Babylon, and against the land of the Chaldeans in the hand of Jeremias the prophet.
<br>2	Declare ye among the nations, and publish it, lift up a standard: proclaim, and conceal it not: say: Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded, Merodach is overthrown, their graven things are confounded, their idols are overthrown.
<br>3	For a nation is come up against her out of the north, which shall make her land desolate: and there shall be none to dwell therein, from man even to beast: yea they are removed, and gone away.
<br>4	In those days, and at that time, saith the Lord, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Juda together: going and weeping they shall make haste, and shall seek the Lord their God.
<br>5	They shall ask the way to Sion, their faces are hitherward. They shall come, and shall be joined to the Lord by an everlasting covenant,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>which shall never be forgotten.
<br>6	My people have been a lost flock, their shep- herds have caused them to go astray, and have made them wander in the mountains: they have gone from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their resting place.
<br>7	All that found them, have devoured them: and their enemies said: We have not sinned in so doing: because they have sinned against the Lord the beauty of justice, and against the Lord the hope of their fathers.
<br>8	Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans: and be ye as kids at the head of the flock.
<br>9	For behold I raise up, and will bring against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the land of the north: and they shall be prepared against her, and from thence she shall be taken: their arrows, like those of a mighty man, a de- stroyer, shall not return in vain.
<br>10	And Chaldea shall be made a prey: all that waste her shall be filled, saith the Lord.
<br>11	Because you rejoice, and speak great things, pillaging my inheritance: because you are spread abroad as calves upon the grass, and have bellowed as bulls.
<br>12	Your mother is confounded exceedingly, and she that bore you is made even with the dust: behold she shall be the last among the na- tions, a wilderness unpassable, and dry.
<br>13	Because of the wrath of the Lord it shall not be inhabited, but shall be wholly desolate: every one that shall pass by Babylon, shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all her plagues.
<br>14	Prepare yourselves against Babylon round about, all you that bend the bow: fight against her, spare not arrows: because she hath sinned against the Lord.
<br>15	Shout against her, she hath every where given her hand, her foundations are fallen, her
<br> 
<br>walls are thrown down, for it is the vengeance of the Lord. Take vengeance upon her: as she hath done, so do to her.
<br>16	Destroy the sower out of Babylon, and him that holdeth the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the sword of the dove every man shall return to his people, and every one shall flee to his own land.
<br>17	Israel is a scattered flock, the lions have driven him away: first the king of Assyria de- voured him: and last this Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon hath broken his bones.
<br>18	Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Behold I will visit the king of Babylon and his land, as I have visited the king of Assyria.
<br>19	And I will bring Israel again to his habi- tation: and he shall feed on Carmel, and Bason, and his soul shall be satisfied in mount Ephraim, and Galaad.
<br>20	In those days, and at that time, saith the Lord, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none: and the sin of Juda, and there shall none be found: for I will be merciful to them, whom I shall leave.
<br>21	Go up against the land of the rulers, and punish the inhabitants thereof, waste, and de- stroy all behind them, saith the Lord: and do according to all that I have commanded thee.
<br>22	A noise of war in the land, and a great destruction.
<br>23	How is the hammer of the whole earth bro- ken, and destroyed! how is Babylon turned into a desert among the nations!
<br>24	I have caused thee to fall into a snare, and thou art taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware of it: thou art found and caught, because thou hast provoked the Lord.
<br>25	The Lord hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the weapons of his wrath:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>for the Lord the God of hosts hath a work to be done in the land of the Chaldeans.
<br>26	Come ye against her from the uttermost borders: open that they may go forth that shall tread her down: take the stones out of the way, and make heaps, and destroy her: and let noth- ing of her be left.
<br>27	Destroy all her valiant men, let them go down to the slaughter: woe to them, for their day is come, the time of their visitation.
<br>28	The voice of them that flee, and of them that have escaped out of the land of Babylon: to declare in Sion the revenge of the Lord our God, the revenge of his temple.
<br>29	Declare to many against Babylon, to all that bend the bow: stand together against her round about, and let none escape; pay her ac- cording to her work: according to all that she hath done, do ye to her: for she hath lifted up herself against the Lord, against the Holy One of Israel.
<br>30	Therefore shall her young men fall in her streets: and all her men of war shall hold their peace in that day, saith the Lord.
<br>31	Behold I come against thee, O proud one, saith the Lord the God of hosts: for thy day is come, the time of thy visitation.
<br>32	And the proud one shall fall, he shall fall down, and there shall be none to lift him up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all round about him.
<br>33	Thus saith the Lord of hosts: The children of Israel, and the children of Juda are oppressed together: all that have taken them captives, hold them fast, they will not let them go.
<br>34	Their redeemer is strong, the Lord of hosts is his name: he will defend their cause in judg- ment, to terrify the land, and to disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.
<br>35	A sword is upon the Chaldeans, saith the
<br> 
<br>Lord, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise men.
<br>36	A sword upon her diviners, and they shall be foolish: a sword upon her valiant ones, and they shall be dismayed.
<br>37	A sword upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all the people that are in the midst of her: and they shall become as women: a sword upon her treasures, and they shall be made a spoil.
<br>38	A drought upon her waters, and they shall be dried up: because it is a land of idols, and they glory in monstrous things.
<br>39	Therefore shall dragons dwell there with the fig fauns: and ostriches shall dwell therein, and it shall be no more inhabited for ever, nei- ther shall it be built up from generation to gen- eration.
<br>40	As the Lord overthrew Sodom and Gomor- rha, and their neighbour cities, saith the Lord: no man shall dwell there, neither shall the son of man inhabit it.
<br>41	Behold a people cometh from the north, and a great nation, and many kings shall rise from the ends of the earth.
<br>42	They shall take the bow and the shield: they are cruel and unmerciful: their voice shall roar like the sea, and they shall ride upon horses: like a man prepared for battle against thee, O daughter of Babylon.
<br>43	The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his hands are grown feeble: anguish hath taken hold of him, pangs as a woman in labour.
<br>44	Behold he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of the Jordan to the strong and beauti- ful: for I will make him run suddenly upon her: and who shall be the chosen one whom I may appoint over her? for who is like to me? and who shall bear up against me? and who is that
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>shepherd that can withstand my countenance?
<br>45	Therefore hear ye the counsel of the Lord, which he hath taken against Babylon: and his thoughts which he hath thought against the land of the Chaldeans: surely the little ones of the flocks shall pull them down, of a truth their habi- tation shall be destroyed with them.
<br>46	At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved, and the cry is heard amongst the nations.
<br>
<br>Chapter 51
<br>Thus saith the Lord: Behold I will raise up as it were a pestilential wind against Babylon and against the inhabitants thereof, who have lifted up their heart against me.
<br>2	And I will send to Babylon fanners, and they shall fan her, and shall destroy her land: for they are come upon her on every side in the day of her affliction.
<br>3	Let not him that bendeth, bend his bow, and let not him go up that is armed with a coat of mail: spare not her young men, destroy all her army.
<br>4	And the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and the wounded in the regions thereof.
<br>5	For Israel and Juda have not been forsaken by their God the Lord of hosts: but their land hath been filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel.
<br>6	Flee ye from the midst of Babylon, and let every one save his own life: be not silent upon her iniquity: for it is the time of revenge from the Lord, he will render unto her what she hath deserved.
<br>7	Babylon hath been a golden cup in the hand of the Lord, that made all the earth drunk: the
<br> 
<br>nations have drunk of her wine, and therefore they have staggered.
<br>8	Babylon is suddenly fallen, and destroyed: howl for her, take balm for her pain, if so she may be healed.
<br>9	We would have cured Babylon, but she is not healed: let us forsake her, and let us go every man to his own land: because her judgment hath reached even to the heavens, and is lifted up to the clouds.
<br>10	The Lord hath brought forth our justices: Come, and let us declare in Sion the work of the Lord our God.
<br>11	Sharpen the arrows, fill the quivers, the Lord hath raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes: and his mind is against Babylon to de- stroy it, because it is the vengeance of the Lord, the vengeance of his temple.
<br>12	Upon the walls of Babylon set up the standard, strengthen the watch: set up the watchmen, prepare the ambushes: for the Lord hath both purposed, and done all that he spoke against the inhabitants of Babylon.
<br>13	O thou that dwellest upon many waters, rich in treasures, thy end is come for thy entire destruction.
<br>14	The Lord of hosts hath sworn by himself, saying: I will fill thee with men as with locusts, and they shall lift up a joyful shout against thee. 15 He that made the earth by his power, that hath prepared the world by his wisdom, and stretched out the heavens by his understanding. 16 When he uttereth his voice the waters are multiplied in heaven: he lifteth up the clouds from the ends of the earth, he hath turned light- ning into rain: and hath brought forth the wind
<br>out of his treasures.
<br>17 Every man is become foolish by his knowl- edge: every founder is confounded by his idol, for what he hath cast is a lie,  and there is no
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>breath in them.
<br>18	They are vain works, and worthy to be laughed at, in the time of their visitation they shall perish.
<br>19	The portion of Jacob is not like them: for he that made all things he it is, and Israel is the sceptre of his inheritance: the Lord of hosts is his name.
<br>20	Thou dashest together for me the weapons of war, and with thee I will dash nations to- gether, and with thee I will destroy kingdoms:
<br>21	And with thee I will break in pieces the horse, and his rider, and with thee I will break in pieces the chariot, and him that getteth up into it:
<br>22	And with thee I will break in pieces man and woman, and with thee I will break in pieces the old man and the child, and with thee I will break in pieces the young man and the virgin:
<br>23	And with thee I will break in pieces the shepherd and his flock, and with thee I will break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen, and with thee I will break in pieces captains and rulers.
<br>24	And I will render to Babylon, and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil, that they have done in Sion, before your eyes, saith the Lord.
