<br>SUBCHAPTER X—LABOR-MANAGEMENT RELATIONS
<br>§4101. Congressional findings and policy
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) experience in both private and public employment indicates that the statutory protection of the right of workers to organize, bargain collectively, and participate through labor organizations of their own choosing in decisions which affect them—
<br>
<br>(A) safeguards the public interest,
<br>
<br>(B) contributes to the effective conduct of public business, and
<br>
<br>(C) facilitates and encourages the amicable settlement of disputes between workers and their employers involving conditions of employment;
<br>
<br>(2) the public interest demands the highest standards of performance by members of the Service and the continuous development and implementation of modern and progressive work practices to facilitate improved performance and efficiency; and
<br>
<br>(3) the unique conditions of Foreign Service employment require a distinct framework for the development and implementation of modern, constructive, and cooperative relationships between management officials and organizations representing members of the Service.
<br>
<br>Therefore, labor organizations and collective bargaining in the Service are in the public interest and are consistent with the requirement of an effective and efficient Government. The provisions of this subchapter should be interpreted in a manner consistent with the requirement of an effective and efficient Government.

<br>§4111. Exclusive recognition
<br>(a) Secret ballot election; majority vote
<br>
<br>The Department shall accord exclusive recognition to a labor organization if the organization has been selected as the representative, in a secret ballot election, by a majority of the employees in a unit who cast valid ballots in the election.
<br>(b) Investigation of petition; hearing; supervision of election; certification of results; length of time between elections
<br>
<br>If a petition is filed with the Board—
<br>
<br>(1) by any person alleging—
<br>
<br>(A) in the case of a unit for which there is no exclusive representative, that 30 percent of the employees in the unit wish to be represented for the purpose of collective bargaining by an exclusive representative, or
<br>
<br>(B) in the case of a unit for which there is an exclusive representative, that 30 percent of the employees in the unit alleged that the exclusive representative is no longer the representative of the majority of the employees in the unit; or
<br>
<br>(2) by any person seeking clarification of, or an amendment to, a certification then in effect or a matter relating to representation;
<br>
<br>the Board shall investigate the petition, and if it has reasonable cause to believe that a question of representation exists, it shall provide an opportunity for a hearing (for which a transcript shall be kept) after reasonable notice. If the Board finds on the record of the hearing that a question of representation exists, the Board shall supervise or conduct an election on the question by secret ballot and shall certify the results thereof. An election under this subsection shall not be conducted in any unit within which a valid election under this subsection has been held during the preceding 12 calendar months or with respect to which a labor organization has been certified as the exclusive representative during the preceding 24 calendar months.
<br>(c) Intervention of labor organizations; placement on ballot
<br>
<br>A labor organization which—
<br>
<br>(1) has been designated by at least 10 percent of the employees in the unit; or
<br>
<br>(2) is the exclusive representative of the employees involved;
<br>
<br>may intervene with respect to a petition filed pursuant to subsection (b) and shall be placed on the ballot of any election under subsection (b) with respect to the petition.
<br>(d) Eligibility to vote; regulations; choices on ballot; preferential voting; certification as exclusive representative
<br>
<br>(1) The Board shall determine who is eligible to vote in any election under this section and shall establish regulations governing any such election, which shall include regulations allowing employees eligible to vote the opportunity to choose—
<br>
<br>(A) from labor organizations on the ballot, that labor organization which the employees wish to have represent them; or
<br>
<br>(B) not to be represented by a labor organization.
<br>
<br>(2) In any election in which more than two choices are on the ballot, the regulations of the Board shall provide for preferential voting. If no choice receives a majority of first preferences, the Board shall distribute to the two choices having the most first preferences the preferences as between those two of the other valid ballots cast. The choice receiving a majority of preferences shall be declared the winner. A labor organization which is declared the winner of the election shall be certified by the Board as the exclusive representative.
<br>(e) Submission of required material
<br>
<br>A labor organization seeking exclusive recognition shall submit to the Board and to the Department a roster of its officers and representatives, a copy of its constitution and bylaws, and a statement of its objectives.
<br>(f) Grounds for denial of exclusive recognition status
<br>
<br>Exclusive recognition shall not be accorded to a labor organization—
<br>
<br>(1) if the Board determines that the labor organization is subject to corrupt influence or influences opposed to democratic principles; or
<br>
<br>(2) in the case of a petition filed under subsection (b)(1)(A), if there is not credible evidence that at least 30 percent of the employees wish to be represented for the purpose of collective bargaining by the labor organization seeking exclusive recognition.
<br>(g) Waiver of hearings; consent elections
<br>
<br>Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the waiving of hearings by stipulation for the purpose of a consent election in conformity with regulations and rules or decisions of the Board.

<br>§4113. Representation rights and duties
<br>(a) Negotiation of collective bargaining agreements; nondiscriminatory representation
<br>
<br>A labor organization which has been accorded exclusive recognition is the exclusive representative of, and is entitled to act for, and negotiate collective bargaining agreements covering, all employees in the unit described in section 4112 of this title.

<br>(2) The Department shall annually inform employees of their rights under paragraph (1)(B).
<br>(c) Duty to bargain in good faith; determination of techniques assisting negotiation
<br>

In addition, the Department and the exclusive representative may determine appropriate techniques, consistent with the provisions of section 4110 of this title, to assist in any negotiation.
<br>(d) Applicability to other employee rights or remedies
<br>
<br>The rights of an exclusive representative under this section shall not preclude an employee from—
<br>
<br>(1) being represented by an attorney or other representative of the employee's own choosing, other than the exclusive representative, in any grievance proceeding under subchapter XI; or
<br>
<br>(2) exercising grievance or appeal rights established by law, rule, or regulation.
<br>(e) Obligations included in good faith bargaining
<br>
<br>The duty of the Department and the exclusive representative to negotiate in good faith shall include the obligation—
<br>
<br>(1) to approach the negotiations with a sincere resolve to reach a collective bargaining agreement;
<br>
<br>(2) to be represented at the negotiations by duly authorized representatives prepared to discuss and negotiate on any condition of employment;
<br>
<br>(3) to meet at reasonable times and convenient places as frequently as may be necessary and to avoid unnecessary delays;
<br>
<br>(4) for the Department to furnish to the exclusive representative, or its authorized representative, upon request and to the extent not prohibited by law, data—
<br>
<br>(A) which is normally maintained by the Department in the regular course of business;
<br>
<br>(B) which is reasonably available and necessary for full and proper discussion, understanding, and negotiation of subjects within the scope of collective bargaining; and
<br>
<br>(C) which does not constitute guidance, advice, counsel, or training provided for management officials or confidential employees, relating to collective bargaining;
<br>
<br>(5) to negotiate jointly with respect to conditions of employment applicable to employees in more than one of the agencies authorized to utilize the Foreign Service personnel system, as determined by the heads of such agencies; and
<br>
<br>(6) if agreement is reached, to execute, upon the request of any party to the negotiation, a written document embodying the agreed terms, and to take the steps necessary to implement the agreement.
<br>(f) Approval of agreement by Secretary; effective date; binding effect
<br>
<br>(1) An agreement between the Department and the exclusive representative shall be subject to approval by the Secretary.
<br>
<br>(2) The Secretary shall approve the agreement within 30 days after the date of the agreement unless the Secretary finds in writing that the agreement is contrary to applicable law, rule, or regulation.
<br>
<br>(3) Unless the Secretary disapproves the agreement by making a finding under paragraph (2), the agreement shall take effect after 30 days from its execution and shall be binding on the Department and the exclusive representative subject to all applicable laws, orders, and regulations.
<br>(g) Consultation by Department with exclusive representative
<br>
<br>The Department shall consult with the exclusive representative with respect to Government-wide or multiagency matters affecting the rights, benefits, or obligations of individuals employed in agencies not authorized to utilize the Foreign Service personnel system. The exclusive representative shall be informed of any change proposed by the Department with respect to such matters, and shall be permitted reasonable time to present its views and recommendations regarding such change. The Department shall consider the views and recommendations of the exclusive representative before taking final action on any such change, and shall provide the exclusive representative a written statement of the reasons for taking the final action.

<br>(a) Grievance procedure
<br>
<br>Any dispute between the Department and the exclusive representative concerning the effect, interpretation, or a claim of breach of a collective bargaining agreement shall be resolved through procedures negotiated by the Department and the exclusive representative.

<br>
<br>(2) provide for expeditious processing, and
<br>
<br>(3) include provision for appeal to the Foreign Service Grievance Board by either party of any dispute not satisfactorily settled.
<br>(b) Review by Foreign Service Labor Relations Board
<br>
<br>Either party to an appeal under subsection (a)(3) may file with the Board an exception to the action of the Foreign Service Grievance Board in resolving the implementation dispute. If, upon review, the Board finds that the action is deficient—
<br>
<br>(1) because it is contrary to any law, rule, or regulation; or
<br>
<br>(2) on other grounds similar to those applied by Federal courts in private sector labor-management relations;
<br>
<br>the Board may take such action and make such recommendations concerning the Foreign Service Grievance Board action as it considers necessary, consistent with applicable laws, rules, and regulations.
<br>(c) Time of filing exceptions; finality and binding nature of action
<br>
<br>If no exception to a Foreign Service Grievance Board action is filed under subsection (b) within 30 days after such action is communicated to the parties, such action shall become final and binding and shall be implemented by the parties.
<br>(d) Judicial review
<br>
<br>Resolutions of disputes under this section shall not be subject to judicial review.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 96–465, title I, §1014, Oct. 17, 1980, 94 Stat. 2137.)
<br>§4115. Unfair labor practices
<br>(a) Department of State

<br>(3) to sponsor, control, or otherwise assist any labor organization, other than to furnish upon request customary and routine services and facilities on an impartial basis to labor organizations having equivalent status;
<br>
<br>(4) to discipline or otherwise discriminate against an employee because the employee has filed a complaint or petition, or has given any information, affidavit, or testimony under this subchapter;
<br>
<br>(5) to refuse to consult or negotiate in good faith with a labor organization, as required under this subchapter;
<br>
<br>(6) to fail or refuse to cooperate in impasse procedures and impasse decisions, as required under this subchapter;
<br>
<br>(7) to enforce any rule or regulation (other than a rule or regulation implementing section 2302 of title 5) which is in conflict with an applicable collective bargaining agreement if the agreement was in effect before the date the rule or regulation was prescribed; or
<br>
<br>(8) to fail or refuse otherwise to comply with any provision of this subchapter.
<br>(b) Labor organizations
<br>
<br>It shall be an unfair labor practice for a labor organization—
<br>
<br>(1) to interfere with, restrain, or coerce any employee in the exercise by the employee of any right under this subchapter;
<br>
<br>(2) to cause or attempt to cause the Department to discriminate against any employee in the exercise by the employee of any right under this subchapter;
<br>
<br>(3) to coerce, discipline, fine, or attempt to coerce a member of the labor organization as punishment or reprisal, or for the purpose of hindering or impeding the member's work performance or productivity as an employee or the discharge of the member's functions as an employee;

<br>(5) to refuse to consult or negotiate in good faith with the Department, as required under this subchapter;

<br>
<br>(7)(A) to call, or participate in, a strike, work stoppage, or slowdown, or to picket the Department in a labor-management dispute (except that any such picketing in the United States which does not interfere with the Department's operations shall not be an unfair labor practice); or
<br>
<br>(B) to condone any unfair labor practice described in subparagraph (A) by failing to take action to prevent or stop such activity;
<br>
<br>(8) to deny membership to any employee in the unit represented by the labor organization except—
<br>
<br>(A) for failure to tender dues uniformly required as a condition of acquiring and retaining membership, or
<br>
<br>(B) in the exercise of disciplinary procedures consistent with the organization's constitution or bylaws and this subchapter; or

<br>
<br>(2) corrects the record with respect to any false or misleading statement made by any person; or
<br>
<br>(3) informs employees of the Government's policy relating to labor-management relations and representation,
<br>
<br>if the expression contains no threat of reprisal or force or promise of benefit and was not made under coercive conditions shall not—
<br>
<br>(A) constitute an unfair labor practice under this subchapter, or
<br>
<br>(B) constitute grounds for the setting aside of any election conducted under this subchapter.
<br>(d) Election of remedies
<br>
<br>Issues which can properly be raised under an appeals procedure may not be raised as unfair labor practices prohibited under this section. Except for matters wherein, under section 4139(a)(2) of this title, an employee has an option of using the grievance procedure under subchapter XI or an appeals procedure, issues which can be raised under section 4114 of this title or subchapter XI may, in the discretion of the aggrieved party, be raised either under such section or subchapter or else raised as an unfair labor practice under this section, but may not be raised both under this section and under section 4114 of this title or subchapter XI.

<br>§4116. Prevention of unfair labor practices
<br>(a) Investigation by General Counsel; issuance of complaint; statement of reasons
<br>
<br>If the Department or labor organization is charged by any person with having engaged in or engaging in an unfair labor practice, the General Counsel shall investigate the charge and may issue and cause to be served upon the Department or labor organization a complaint. In any case in which the General Counsel does not issue a complaint because the charge fails to state an unfair labor practice, the General Counsel shall provide the person making the charge a written statement of the reasons for not issuing a complaint.
<br>(b) Notice in complaint
<br>
<br>Any complaint under subsection (a) shall contain a notice—
<br>
<br>(1) of the charge;
<br>
<br>(2) that a hearing will be held before the Board (or any member thereof or before an individual employed by the Board and designated for such purpose); and
<br>
<br>(3) of the time and place fixed for the hearing.
<br>(c) Answer; personal appearance
<br>
<br>The labor organization or Department involved shall have the right to file an answer to the original and any amended complaint and to appear in person or otherwise and give testimony at the time and place fixed in the complaint for the hearing.
<br>(d) Time of filing of charges
<br>
<br>(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), no complaint shall be issued based on any alleged unfair labor practice which occurred more than 6 months before the filing of the charge with the Board.
<br>
<br>(2) If the General Counsel determines that the person filing any charge was prevented from filing the charge during the 6-month period referred to in paragraph (1) by reason of—
<br>
<br>(A) any failure of the Department or labor organization against which the charge is made to perform a duty owed to the person, or
<br>
<br>(B) any concealment which prevented discovery of the alleged unfair labor practice during the 6-month period,
<br>
<br>the General Counsel may issue a complaint based on the charge if the charge was filed during the 6-month period beginning on the day of the discovery by the person of the alleged unfair labor practice.
<br>(e) Regulations providing for resolution through informal methods
<br>
<br>The General Counsel may prescribe regulations providing for informal methods by which the alleged unfair labor practice may be resolved prior to the issuance of a complaint.
<br>(f) Hearing
<br>
<br>The Board (or any member thereof or any individual employed by the Board and designated for such purpose) shall conduct a hearing on the complaint not earlier than 5 days after the date on which the complaint is served. In the discretion of the individual or individuals conducting the hearing, any person involved may be allowed to intervene in the hearing and to present testimony. Any such hearing shall, to the extent practicable, be conducted in accordance with the provisions of subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5, except that the parties shall not be bound by rules of evidence, whether statutory, common law, or adopted by a court. A transcript shall be kept of the hearing. After such a hearing the Board, in its discretion, may upon notice receive further evidence or hear argument.
<br>(g) Findings of fact relative to issuance of orders; backpay
<br>
<br>If the Board (or any member thereof or any individual employed by the Board and designated for such purpose) determines after any hearing on a complaint under subsection (f) that the preponderance of the evidence received demonstrates that the Department or labor organization named in the complaint has engaged in or is engaging in an unfair labor practice, then the individual or individuals conducting the hearing shall state in writing their findings of fact and shall issue and cause to be served on the Department or labor organization an order—
<br>
<br>(1) to cease and desist from any such unfair labor practice in which the Department or labor organization is engaged;
<br>
<br>(2) requiring the parties to renegotiate a collective bargaining agreement in accordance with the order of the Board and requiring that the agreement, as amended, be given retroactive effect;
<br>
<br>(3) requiring reinstatement of an employee with backpay in accordance with section 5596 of title 5; or
<br>
<br>(4) including any combination of the actions described in paragraphs (1) through (3) or such other action as will carry out the purpose of this subchapter.
<br>
<br>If any such order requires reinstatement of an employee with backpay, backpay may be required of the Department (as provided in section 5596 of title 5) or of the labor organization, as the case may be, which is found to have engaged in the unfair labor practice involved.
<br>(h) Findings of fact requiring dismissal of complaint
<br>
<br>If the individual or individuals conducting the hearing determine that the preponderance of the evidence received fails to demonstrate that the Department or labor organization named in the complaint has engaged in or is engaging in an unfair labor practice, the individual or individuals shall state in writing their findings of fact and shall issue an order dismissing the complaint.

<br>§4117. Standards of conduct for labor organizations
<br>(a) Freedom from corrupt influences and influences opposed to basic democratic principles
<br>
<br>The Department shall accord recognition only to a labor organization that is free from corrupt influences and influences opposed to basic democratic principles. Except as provided in subsection (b), an organization is not required to prove that it is free from such influences if it is subject to a governing requirement adopted by the organization or by a national or international labor organization or federation of labor organizations with which it is affiliated, or in which it participates, containing explicit and detailed provisions to which it subscribes calling for—
<br>
<br>(1) the maintenance of democratic procedures and practices, including—
<br>
<br>(A) provisions for periodic elections to be conducted subject to recognized safeguards, and
<br>
<br>(B) provisions defining and securing the right of individual members to participate in the affairs of the organization, to receive fair and equal treatment under the governing rules of the organization, and to receive fair process in disciplinary proceedings;
<br>
<br>(2) the exclusion from office in the organization of persons affiliated with Communist or other totalitarian movements and persons identified with corrupt influences;
<br>
<br>(3) the prohibition of business or financial interests on the part of organization officers and agents which conflict with their duty to the organization and its members; and
<br>
<br>(4) the maintenance of fiscal integrity in the conduct of the affairs of the organization, including provisions for accounting and financial controls and regular financial reports or summaries to be made available to members.
<br>(b) Furnishing of information
<br>
<br>A labor organization may be required to furnish evidence of its freedom from corrupt influences opposed to basic democratic principles if there is reasonable cause to believe that—
<br>
<br>(1) the organization has been suspended or expelled from, or is subject to other sanction by, a parent labor organization, or federation of organizations with which it has been affiliated, because it has demonstrated an unwillingness or inability to comply with governing requirements comparable in purpose to those required by subsection (a); or

<br>(A) disciplinary action or the retirement of a grievant from the Service under section 4007 or 4008 of this title, or
<br>
<br>(B) issues which, in the judgment of the Board, can best be resolved by a hearing or presentation of oral argument.
<br>
<br>(2) The grievant, the representatives of the grievant, the exclusive representative (if the grievant is a member of the bargaining unit represented by the exclusive representative), and the representatives of the Department are entitled to be present at the hearing. The Board may, after considering the views of the parties and any other individuals connected with the grievance, decide that a hearing should be open to others. Testimony at a hearing shall be given under oath, which any Board member or individual designated by the Board shall have authority to administer.
<br>
<br>(3) Each party (including an exclusive representative appearing in the proceedings) shall be entitled to examine and cross-examine witnesses at the hearing or by deposition and to serve interrogatories upon another party and have such interrogatories answered by the other party unless the Board finds such interrogatory irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitive. Upon request of the Board, or upon a request of the grievant deemed relevant and material by the Board, an agency shall promptly make available at the hearing or by deposition any witness under its control, supervision, or responsibility, except that if the Board determines that the presence of such witness at the hearing is required for just resolution of the grievance, then the witness shall be made available at the hearing, with necessary costs and travel expenses paid by the Department.
<br>
<br>(4) During any hearing held by the Board, any oral or documentary evidence may be received, but the Board shall exclude any irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence, as determined under section 556 of title 5.
<br>
<br>(5) A verbatim transcript shall be made of any hearing and shall be part of the record of proceedings.
<br>
<br>(6) In those grievances in which the Board does not hold a hearing, the Board shall afford to each party the opportunity to review and to supplement, by written submissions, the record of proceedings prior to the decision by the Board. The decision of the Board shall be based exclusively on the record of proceedings.
<br>
<br>(7) The Board may act by or through panels or individual members designated by the Chairperson, except that hearings within the continental United States shall be held by panels of at least three members unless the parties agree otherwise. References in this subchapter to the Board shall be considered to be references to a panel or member of the Board where appropriate. All members of the Board shall act as impartial individuals in considering grievances.
<br>
<br>(8) If the Board determines that the Department is considering the involuntary separation of the grievant (other than an involuntary separation for cause under section 4010(a) of this title), disciplinary action against the grievant, or recovery from the grievant of alleged overpayment of salary, expenses, or allowances, which is related to a grievance pending before the Board and that such action should be suspended, the Department shall suspend such action until the date which is one year after such determination or until the Board has ruled upon the grievance, whichever comes first. The Board shall extend the one-year limitation under the preceding sentence and the Department shall continue to suspend such action, if the Board determines that the agency or the Board is responsible for the delay in the resolution of the grievance. The Board may also extend the 1-year limit if it determines that the delay is due to the complexity of the case, the unavailability of witnesses or to circumstances beyond the control of the agency, the Board or the grievant. Notwithstanding such suspension of action, the head of the agency concerned or a chief of mission or principal officer may exclude the grievant from official premises or from the performance of specified functions when such exclusion is determined in writing to be essential to the functioning of the post or office to which the grievant is assigned.
<br>
<br>(9) The Board may reconsider any decision upon presentation of newly discovered or previously unavailable material evidence.

<br>
