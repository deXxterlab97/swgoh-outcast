<br>
<br>"(3) In 2000, the United States and Vietnam concluded a bilateral trade agreement that included commitments on goods, services, intellectual property rights, and investment.

<br>
<br>"The Congress finds the following:
<br>
<br>"(1) The Government of the United States extended full diplomatic recognition to Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania in 1922.
<br>
<br>"(2) The Government of the United States entered into agreements extending most-favored-nation treatment with the Government of Estonia on August 1, 1925, the Government of Latvia on April 30, 1926, and the Government of Lithuania on July 10, 1926.
<br>
<br>"(3) The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics incorporated Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania involuntarily into the Union as a result of a secret protocol to a German-Soviet agreement in 1939 which assigned those three states to the Soviet sphere of influence; and the Government of the United States has at no time recognized the forcible incorporation of those states into the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.
<br>
<br>"(4) The Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1951 [see Short Title of 1951 Amendment note set out under section 1654 of this title] required the President to suspend, withdraw, or prevent the application of trade benefits, including most-favored-nation treatment, to countries under the domination or control of the world Communist movement.
<br>
<br>"(5) In 1951, responsible representatives of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania stated that they did not object to the imposition of 'such controls as the Government of the United States may consider to be appropriate' to the products of those countries, for such time as those countries remained under Soviet domination or control.
<br>
<br>"(6) In 1990, the democratically elected governments of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania declared the restoration of their independence from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

<br>"(7) The Government of the United States established diplomatic relations with Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania on September 2, 1991, and on September 6, 1991, the State Council of the transitional government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics recognized the independence of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, thereby ending the involuntary incorporation of those countries into, and the domination of those countries by, the Soviet Union.
<br>

<br>"SEC. 102. EXTENSION OF NONDISCRIMINATORY TREATMENT TO THE PRODUCTS OF ESTONIA, LATVIA, AND LITHUANIA.
<br>
<br>"(a) In General.—Notwithstanding any provision of title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2431 et seq.) or any other provision of law, nondiscriminatory treatment (most-favored-nation treatment) applies to the products of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.
<br>
<br>"(b) Conforming Tariff Schedule Amendments.—General Note 3(b) of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States is amended by striking out 'Estonia', 'Latvia', and 'Lithuania'.
<br>
<br>"(c) Effective Date.—Subsection (a) and the amendments made by subsection (b) apply with respect to goods entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the 15th day after the date of the enactment of this Act [Dec. 4, 1991].

<br>"SEC. 104. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING PROMPT PROVISION OF GSP TREATMENT TO THE PRODUCTS OF ESTONIA, LATVIA, AND LITHUANIA.

<br>Pub. L. 104–162, July 18, 1996, 110 Stat. 1414, provided that:
<br>"SECTION 1. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND SUPPLEMENTAL ACTION.
<br>
<br>"(a) Congressional Findings.—The Congress finds that Bulgaria—
<br>
<br>"(1) has received most-favored-nation treatment since 1991 and has been found to be in full compliance with the freedom of emigration requirements under title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2431 et seq.] since 1993;

<br>
<br>"(3) is in the process of acceding to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the World Trade Organization (WTO), and extension of unconditional most-favored-nation treatment would enable the United States to avail itself of all rights under the GATT and the WTO with respect to Bulgaria; and
<br>
<br>"(4) has demonstrated a strong desire to build friendly relationships and to cooperate fully with the United States on trade matters.
<br>
<br>"(b) Supplemental Action.—The Congress notes that the United States Trade Representative intends to negotiate with Bulgaria in order to preserve the commitments of that country under the bilateral commercial agreement in effect between that country and the United States that are consistent with the GATT and the WTO.
<br>"SEC. 2. TERMINATION OF APPLICATION OF TITLE IV OF THE TRADE ACT OF 1974 TO BULGARIA.
<br>
<br>"(a) Presidential Determinations and Extension of Nondiscriminatory Treatment.—Notwithstanding any provision of title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2431 et seq.), the President may—

<br>"(1) determine that such title should no longer apply to Bulgaria; and
<br>
<br>"(2) after making a determination under paragraph (1) with respect to Bulgaria, proclaim the extension of nondiscriminatory treatment (most-favored-nation treatment) to the products of that country.

<br>"(2) to deny credit, credit guarantees, and investment guarantees to, or for the benefit of, Afghanistan under any Federal program.
<br>
<br>"(b) If the President has not denied nondiscriminatory trade treatment to the products of Afghanistan before the date that is 45 days after the date of enactment of this joint resolution [Dec. 19, 1985], the President shall submit to the Congress on such date a report which states the reasons why the President has not denied such treatment.

<br>§2435. Commercial agreements
<br>(a) Presidential authority
<br>
<br>Subject to the provisions of subsections (b) and (c) of this section, the President may authorize the entry into force of bilateral commercial agreements providing nondiscriminatory treatment to the products of countries heretofore denied such treatment whenever he determines that such agreements with such countries will promote the purposes of this chapter and are in the national interest.
<br>(b) Terms of agreements
<br>
<br>Any such bilateral commercial agreement shall—
<br>
<br>(1) be limited to an initial period specified in the agreement which shall be no more than 3 years from the date the agreement enters into force; except that it may be renewable for additional periods, each not to exceed 3 years; if—
<br>
<br>(A) a satisfactory balance of concessions in trade and services has been maintained during the life of such agreement, and
<br>
<br>(B) the President determines that actual or foreseeable reductions in United States tariffs and nontariff barriers to trade resulting from multilateral negotiations are satisfactorily reciprocated by the other party to the bilateral agreement;
<br>
<br>(2) provide that it is subject to suspension or termination at any time for national security reasons, or that the other provisions of such agreement shall not limit the rights of any party to take any action for the protection of its security interests;
<br>
<br>(3) include safeguard arrangements (A) providing for prompt consultations whenever either actual or prospective imports cause or threaten to cause, or significantly contribute to, market disruption and (B) authorizing the imposition of such import restrictions as may be appropriate to prevent such market disruption;
<br>
<br>(4) if the other party to the bilateral agreement is not a party to the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, provide rights for United States nationals with respect to patents and trademarks in such country not less than the rights specified in such convention;
<br>
<br>(5) if the other party to the bilateral agreement is not a party to the Universal Copyright Convention, provide rights for United States nationals with respect to copyrights in such country not less than the rights specified in such convention;
<br>
<br>(6) in the case of an agreement entered into or renewed after January 3, 1975, provide arrangements for the protection of industrial rights and processes;
<br>
<br>(7) provide arrangements for the settlement of commercial differences and disputes;
<br>
<br>(8) in the case of an agreement entered into or renewed after January 3, 1975, provide arrangements for the promotion of trade, which may include arrangements for the establishment or expansion of trade and tourist promotion offices, for facilitation of activities of governmental commercial officers, participation in trade fairs and exhibits, and the sending of trade missions, and for facilitation of entry, establishment, and travel of commercial representatives;
<br>
<br>(9) provide for consultations for the purpose of reviewing the operation of the agreement and relevant aspects of relations between the United States and the other party; and
<br>
<br>(10) provide such other arrangements of a commercial nature as will promote the purposes of this chapter.
<br>(c) Congressional action
<br>
<br>An agreement referred to in subsection (a), and a proclamation referred to in section 2434(a) of this title implementing such agreement, shall take effect only if a joint resolution described in section 2191(b)(3) of this title that approves of the agreement referred to in subsection (a) is enacted into law.

<br>§2436. Market disruption
<br>(a) Investigation by International Trade Commission; report; publication
<br>
<br>(1) Upon the filing of a petition by an entity described in section 2252(a) of this title, upon request of the President or the United States Trade Representative, upon resolution of either the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives or the Committee on Finance of the Senate, or on its own motion, the International Trade Commission (hereafter in this section referred to as the "Commission") shall promptly make an investigation to determine, with respect to imports of an article which is the product of a Communist country, whether market disruption exists with respect to an article produced by a domestic industry.
<br>
<br>(2) The provisions of subsections (a)(3), (b)(4),1 and (c)(4) of section 2252 of this title shall apply with respect to investigations by the Commission under paragraph (1).
<br>
<br>(3) The Commission shall report to the President its determination with respect to each investigation under paragraph (1) and the basis therefor and shall include in each report any dissenting or separate views. If the Commission finds, as a result of its investigation, that market disruption exists with respect to an article produced by a domestic industry, it shall find the amount of the increase in, or imposition of, any duty or other import restriction on such article which is necessary to prevent or remedy such market disruption and shall include such finding in its report to the President. The Commission shall furnish to the President a transcript of the hearings and any briefs which may have been submitted in connection with each investigation.
<br>
<br>(4) The report of the Commission of its determination with respect to an investigation under paragraph (1) shall be made at the earliest practicable time, but not later than 3 months after the date on which the petition is filed (or the date on which the request or resolution is received or the motion is adopted, as the case may be). Upon making such report to the President, the Commission shall also promptly make public such report (with the exception of information which the Commission determines to be confidential) and shall cause a summary thereof to be published in the Federal Register.
<br>(b) Affirmative determination
<br>
<br>With respect to any affirmative determination of the Commission under subsection (a)—
<br>
<br>(1) such determination shall be treated as an affirmative determination made under section 2251(b) of this title (as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988); and
<br>
<br>(2) sections 2252 and 2253 of this title (as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of such Act of 1988), rather than the provisions of part 1 of subchapter II of this chapter as amended by section 1401 of such Act of 1988, shall apply with respect to the taking of subsequent action, if any, by the President in response to such affirmative determination;
<br>
<br>except that—
<br>
<br>(A) the President may take action under such sections 2252 and 2253 of this title only with respect to imports from the country or countries involved of the article with respect to which the affirmative determination was made; and
<br>
<br>(B) if such action consists of, or includes, an orderly marketing agreement, such agreement shall be entered into within 60 days after the import relief determination date.
<br>(c) Products of Communist countries
<br>
<br>If, at any time, the President finds that there are reasonable grounds to believe, with respect to imports of an article which is the product of a Communist country, that market disruption exists with respect to an article produced by a domestic industry, he shall request the Commission to initiate an investigation under subsection (a). If the President further finds that emergency action is necessary, he may take action under sections 2252 and 2253 of this title referred to in subsection (b) as if an affirmative determination of the Commission had been made under subsection (a). Any action taken by the President under the preceding sentence shall cease to apply (1) if a negative determination is made by the Commission under subsection (a) with respect to imports of such article, on the day on which the Commission's report of such determination is submitted to the President, or (2) if an affirmative determination is made by the Commission under subsection (a) with respect to imports of such article, on the day on which the action taken by the President pursuant to such determination becomes effective.
<br>(d) Petitions to initiate consultations as provided for by safeguard arrangements
<br>
<br>(1) A petition may be filed with the President by an entity described in section 2252(a) of this title requesting the President to initiate consultations provided for by the safeguard arrangements of any agreement entered into under section 2435 of this title with respect to imports of an article which is the product of the country which is the other party to such agreement.
<br>
<br>(2) If the President determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe, with respect to imports of such article, that market disruption exists with respect to an article produced by a domestic industry, he shall initiate consultations with such country with respect to such imports.
<br>(e) Definitions; factors determining existence of market disruption
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section—
<br>
<br>(1) The term "Communist country" means any country dominated or controlled by communism.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) Market disruption exists within a domestic industry whenever imports of an article, like or directly competitive with an article produced by such domestic industry, are increasing rapidly, either absolutely or relatively, so as to be a significant cause of material injury, or threat thereof, to such domestic industry.
<br>
<br>(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A):
<br>
<br>(i) Imports of an article shall be considered to be increasing rapidly if there has been a significant increase in such imports (either actual or relative to domestic production) during a recent period of time.
<br>
<br>(ii) The term "significant cause" refers to a cause which contributes significantly to the material injury of the domestic industry, but need not be equal to or greater than any other cause.
<br>
<br>(C) The Commission, in determining whether market disruption exists, shall consider, among other factors—
<br>
<br>(i) the volume of imports of the merchandise which is the subject of the investigation;
<br>
<br>(ii) the effect of imports of the merchandise on prices in the United States for like or directly competitive articles;
<br>
<br>(iii) the impact of imports of such merchandise on domestic producers of like or directly competitive articles; and
<br>
<br>(iv) evidence of disruptive pricing practices, or other efforts to unfairly manage trade patterns.

<br>(c) Factors affecting country designation
<br>
<br>In determining whether to designate any country as a beneficiary developing country under this subchapter, the President shall take into account—

<br>
<br>(A) reduce trade distorting investment practices and policies (including export performance requirements); and
<br>

<br>(2) Changed circumstances
<br>
<br>The President shall, after complying with the requirements of subsection (f)(2), withdraw or suspend the designation of any country as a beneficiary developing country if, after such designation, the President determines that as the result of changed circumstances such country would be barred from designation as a beneficiary developing country under subsection (b)(2). Such country shall cease to be a beneficiary developing country on the day on which the President issues an Executive order or Presidential proclamation revoking the designation of such country under this subchapter.
<br>(3) Advice to Congress
<br>
<br>The President shall, as necessary, advise the Congress on the application of section 2461 of this title and subsection (c) of this section, and the actions the President has taken to withdraw, to suspend, or to limit the application of duty-free treatment with respect to any country which has failed to adequately take the actions described in subsection (c).
<br>(e) Mandatory graduation of beneficiary developing countries
<br>
<br>If the President determines that a beneficiary developing country has become a "high income" country, as defined by the official statistics of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, then the President shall terminate the designation of such country as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of this subchapter, effective on January 1 of the second year following the year in which such determination is made.

<br>At least 60 days before the President designates any country as a least-developed beneficiary developing country, the President shall notify the Congress of the President's intention to make such designation.
<br>(2) Notification of termination
<br>
<br>If the President has designated any country as a beneficiary developing country under this subchapter, the President shall not terminate such designation unless, at least 60 days before such termination, the President has notified the Congress and has notified such country of the President's intention to terminate such designation, together with the considerations entering into such decision.
