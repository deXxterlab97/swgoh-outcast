<br>who chose me above thy father, and above all his house, to appoint me prince over the people of the LORD, over Israel, before the LORD will I make merry. 22And I will be yet more vile than thus, and will be base in mine own sight; and with the handmaids whom thou hast spoken of, with them will I get me honour.’ 23And Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death.
<br>And it came to pass, when the king dwelt in his house, and the LORD had given him rest from all his enemies round about, 2that the king said unto Nathan the prophet: ‘See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the	ark	of	God	dwelleth	within curtains.’ 3And Nathan said to the king: ‘Go, do all that is in thy heart; for the LORD is with thee.’ 4And it came to pass the same night, that the word of the LORD came unto Nathan, saying: 5’Go and tell My servant David: Thus saith the LORD: Shalt thou build Me a house for Me to dwell in? 6for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle. 7In all places wherein I have walked among all the children of Israel, spoke I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed My people Israel, saying: Why have ye not built Me a house of cedar? 8Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto My servant David: Thus saith the LORD of hosts: I took thee from the
<br> 
<br>sheepcote, from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be prince over My people, over Israel. 9And I have been with thee whithersoever thou didst go, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee; and I will make thee a great name, like unto the name of the great ones that are in the earth. 10And I will appoint a place for My people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be disquieted no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as at the first, 11even from the day that I commanded judges to be over My people Israel; and I will cause thee to rest from all thine enemies. Moreover the LORD telleth thee that the LORD will make thee a house. 12When thy days are fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, that shall proceed out of thy body, and I will establish his kingdom. 13He shall build a house for My name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever. 14I will be to him for a father, and he shall be to Me for a son; if he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men; 15but My mercy shall not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee. 16And thy house and thy kingdom shall be made sure for ever before thee; thy throne shall be established for ever.’ 17According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.
<br> 
<br>18Then David the king went in, and sat before the LORD; and he said: ‘Who am I, O Lord GOD, and what is my house, that Thou hast brought me thus far? 19And this was yet a small thing in Thine eyes, O Lord GOD; but Thou hast spoken also of Thy servant’s house for a great while to come; and this too after the manner of great men, O Lord GOD. 20And what can David say more unto Thee? for Thou knowest Thy servant, O Lord GOD. 21For Thy word’s sake, and according to Thine own heart, hast Thou wrought all this greatness, to make Thy servant know it. 22Therefore Thou art great, O LORD God; for there is none like Thee, neither is there any God beside Thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears. 23And who is like Thy people, like Israel, a nation one in the earth, whom God went to redeem unto Himself for a people, and to make Him a name, and to do for Thy land great things and tremendous, even for you, [in driving out] from before Thy people, whom Thou didst redeem to Thee out of Egypt, the nations and their gods? 24And Thou didst establish to Thyself Thy people Israel to be a people unto Thee for ever; and Thou, LORD, becamest their God. 25And now, O LORD God, the word that Thou hast spoken concerning Thy servant, and concerning his house, confirm Thou it for ever, and do as Thou hast spoken. 26And let Thy name be magnified for ever, that it may be said: The LORD of hosts is God over Israel; and the house
<br> 
<br>of Thy servant David shall be established before Thee. 27For Thou, O LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, hast revealed to Thy servant, saying: I will build thee a house; therefore hath Thy servant taken heart to pray this prayer unto Thee. 28And now, O Lord GOD, Thou alone art God, and Thy words are truth, and Thou hast promised this good thing unto Thy servant; 29now therefore let it please Thee to bless the house of Thy servant, that it may continue for ever before Thee; for Thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken it; and through Thy blessing let the house of Thy servant be blessed for ever.’
<br>And after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued	them;	and	David	took Metheg-ammah out of the hand of the
<br>Philistines.
<br>2And he smote Moab, and measured them with the line, making them to lie down on the ground; and he measured two lines to put to death, and one full line to keep alive. And the Moabites became servants to David, and brought presents. 3David smote also Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to establish his dominion at the river Euphrates. 4And David took from him a thousand and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen; and David houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for a hundred chariots. 5And when the Arameans of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of Zobah, David smote of the Arameans two and
<br> 
<br>twenty thousand men. 6Then David put garrisons in Aram of Damascus; and the Arameans became servants to David, and brought presents. And the LORD gave victory to David whithersoever he went. 7And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. 8And from Betah and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass.
<br>9And when Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer, 10then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him, and to bless him—because he had fought against Hadadezer and smitten him; for Hadadezer had wars with Toi—and he brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass. 11These also did king David dedicate unto the LORD, with the silver and gold that he dedicated of all the nations which he subdued: 12of Aram, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah. 13And David got him a name when he returned from smiting the Arameans in the Valley of Salt, even eighteen thousand men. 14And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all the Edomites became servants to David. And the LORD gave victory to David whithersoever he went.
<br> 
<br>15And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed justice and righteousness unto all his people. 16And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder; 17and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were priests; and Seraiah was scribe; 18and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David’s sons were chief ministers.
<br>And David said: ‘Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul,
<br>that I may show him kindness for Jonathan’s sake?’ 2Now there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba, and they called him unto David; and the king said unto him: ‘Art thou Ziba?’ And he said: ‘Thy servant is he.’ 3And the king said: ‘Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may show the kindness of God unto him?’ And Ziba said unto the king: ‘Jonathan hath yet a son, who is lame on his feet.’ 4And the king said unto him: ‘Where is he?’ And Ziba said unto the king: ‘Behold, he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, in Lo-debar.’ 5Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lo-debar. 6And Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came unto David, and fell on his face, and prostrated himself. And David said: ‘Mephibosheth! ’ And he answered: ‘Behold thy servant! ’ 7And David said unto him: ‘Fear not; for I
<br> 
<br>will surely show thee kindness for Jonathan thy father’s sake, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually.’ 8And he bowed down, and said: ‘What is thy servant, that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?’
<br>9Then the king called to Ziba, Saul’s servant, and said unto him: ‘All that pertained to Saul and to all his house have I given unto thy master’s son. 10And thou shalt till the land for him, thou, and thy sons, and thy servants; and thou shalt bring in the fruits, that thy master’s son may have bread to eat; but Mephibosheth thy master’s son shall eat bread continually at my table.’ Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants. 11Then said Ziba unto the king: ‘According to all that my lord the king commandeth his servant, so shall thy servant do; but Mephibosheth eateth at my table as one of the king’s sons.’ 12Now Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Mica. And all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth. 13But Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem; for he did eat continually at the king’s table; and he was lame on both his feet.
<br>And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead. 2And David said: ‘I will show kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father showed kindness unto me.’ So David sent by
<br> 
<br>the hand of his servants to comfort him concerning his father. And David’s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon. 3But the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord: ‘Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not David sent his servants unto thee to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?’ 4So Hanun took David’s servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away. 5When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them; for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said: ‘Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.’
<br>6And when the children of Ammon saw that they were become odious to David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Arameans of Beth-rehob, and the Arameans of Zobah, twenty thousand footmen, and the king of Maacah with a thousand men, and the men of Tob twelve thousand men. 7And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men. 8And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entrance of the gate; and the Arameans of Zobah, and of Rehob, and the men of Tob and Maacah, were by themselves in the field.
<br>9Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of
<br> 
<br>Israel, and put them in array against the Arameans; 10and the rest of the people he committed into the hand of aAbishai his brother, and he put them in array against the children of Ammon. 11And he said: ‘If the Arameans be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me, but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee. 12Be of good courage, and let us prove strong for our people, and for the cities of our God; and the LORD do that which seemeth Him good.’ 13So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh unto the battle against the Arameans; and they fled before him. 14And when the children of Ammon saw that the Arameans were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai, and entered into the city. Then Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.
<br>15And when the Arameans saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they gathered themselves together. 16And Hadadezer sent, and brought out the Arameans that were beyond the River; and they came to Helam, with Shobach the captain of the host of Hadadezer at their head. 17And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Arameans set themselves in array against David, and fought with him. 18And the Arameans fled before
<br>
<br>a Heb. Abshai.
<br> 
<br>Israel; and David slew of the Arameans seven hundred drivers of chariots, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, so that he died there. 19And when all the kings that were servants to Hadadezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Arameans feared to help the children of Ammon any more.
<br>And it came to pass, at the return of the year, at the time
<br>when kings go out to battle, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem.
<br>2And it came to pass at eventide, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king’s house; and from the roof he saw a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon. 3And David sent and inquired after the woman. And one said: ‘Is not this Bath-sheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?’ 4And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness; and she returned unto her house. 5And the woman conceived; and she sent and told David, and said: ‘I am with child.’
<br>6And David sent to Joab [, saying]: ‘Send me Uriah the Hittite.’ And Joab sent Uriah to David. 7And when Uriah
<br> 
<br>was come unto him, David asked of him how Joab did, and how the people fared, and how the war prospered. 8And David said to Uriah: ‘Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet.’ And Uriah departed out of the king’s house, and there followed him a mess of food from the king. 9But Uriah slept at the door of the king’s house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house. 10And when they had told David, saying: ‘Uriah went not down unto his house’, David said unto Uriah: ‘Art thou not come from a journey? wherefore didst thou not go down unto thy house?’ 11And Uriah said unto David: ‘The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in booths; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open field; shall I then go into my house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as thou livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing.’ 12And David said to Uriah: ‘Tarry here to-day also, and to- morrow I will let thee depart.’ So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow. 13And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and he made him drunk; and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house.
<br>14And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah. 15And he wrote in the letter, saying: ‘Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him,
<br> 
<br>that he may be smitten, and die.’ 16And it came to pass, when Joab kept watch upon the city, that he assigned Uriah unto the place where he knew that valiant men were. 17And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab; and there fell some of the people, even of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also. 18Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war; 19and he charged the messenger, saying: ‘When thou hast made an end of telling all the things concerning the war unto the king, 20it shall be that, if the king’s wrath arise, and he say unto thee: Wherefore went ye so nigh unto the city to fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall? 21who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast an upper millstone upon him from the wall, that he died at Thebez? why went ye so nigh the wall? then shalt thou say: Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.’
<br>22So the messenger went, and came and told David all that Joab had sent him for. 23And the messenger said unto David: ‘The men prevailed against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them even unto the entrance of the gate. 24And the shooters shot at thy servants from off the wall; and some of the king’s servants are dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.’ 25Then David said unto the messenger: ‘Thus shalt thou say unto Joab: Let not this
<br> 
<br>thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth in one manner or another; make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it; and encourage thou him.’
<br>26And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she made lamentation for her husband. 27And when the mourning was past, David sent and took her home to his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD.
<br>And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto
<br>him, and said unto him: ‘There were two men in one city: the one rich, and the other poor. 2The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds; 3but the poor man had nothing save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and reared; and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own morsel, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter. 4And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him, but took the poor man’s lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.’ 5And David’s anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan: ‘As the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this deserveth to die; 6and he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.’
<br> 
<br>7And Nathan said to David: ‘Thou art the man. Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul; 8and I gave thee thy master’s house, and thy master’s wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that were too little, then would I add unto thee so much more. 9Wherefore hast thou despised the word of the LORD, to do that which is evil in My sight? Uriah the Hittite thou hast smitten with the sword, and his wife thou hast taken to be thy wife, and him thou hast slain with the sword of the children of Ammon. 10Now therefore, the sword shall never depart from thy house; because thou hast despised Me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife. 11Thus saith the LORD: Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun. 12For thou didst it secretly; but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.’ 13And David said unto Nathan: ‘I have sinned against the LORD.’ And Nathan said unto David: ‘The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die. 14Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast greatly blasphemed the enemies of the LORD, the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die.’ 15And Nathan departed unto his house.
<br> 
<br>And the LORD struck the child that Uriah’s wife bore unto David, and it was very sick. 16David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and as often as he went in, he lay all night upon the earth. 17And the elders of his house arose, and stood beside him, to raise him up from the earth; but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them. 18And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead; for they said: ‘Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke unto him, and he hearkened not unto our voice; how then shall we tell him that the child is dead, so that he do himself some harm?’ 19But when David saw that his servants whispered together, David perceived that the child was dead; and David said unto his servants: ‘Is the child dead?’ And they said: ‘He is dead.’ 20Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel; and he came into the house of the LORD, and worshipped; then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat. 21Then said his servants unto him: ‘What thing is this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.’ 22And he said: ‘While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept; for I said: Who knoweth whether the LORD will not be gracious to me, that the
<br> 
<br>child may live? 23But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me.’
<br>24And David comforted Bath-sheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her; and she bore a son, and called his name Solomon. And the LORD loved him; 25and He sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet, and he called his name aJedidiah, for the LORD’S sake.
<br>26Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city. 27And Joab sent messengers to David, and said: ‘I have fought against Rabbah, yea, I have taken the city of waters. 28Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it; lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.’ 29And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it. 30And he took the crown of Malcam from off his head; and the weight thereof was a talent of gold, and in it were precious stones; and it was set on David’s head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city, exceeding much. 31And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln; and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. And
<br>
<br>a That is, Beloved of the LORD.
<br> 
<br>David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem.
<br>And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David
<br>had a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her. 2And Amnon was so distressed that he fell sick because of his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and it seemed hard to Amnon to do any thing unto her. 3But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David’s brother; and Jonadab was a very subtle man. 4And he said unto him: ‘Why, O son of the king, art thou thus becoming leaner from day to day? wilt thou not tell me?’ And Amnon said unto him: ‘I love Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.’ 5And Jonadab said unto him: ‘Lay thee down on thy bed, and feign thyself sick; and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him: Let my sister Tamar come, I pray thee, and give me bread to eat, and dress the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand.’ 6So Amnon lay down, and feigned himself sick; and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king: ‘Let my sister Tamar come, I pray thee, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.’
<br>7Then David sent home to Tamar, saying: ‘Go now to thy brother Amnon’s house, and dress him food.’ 8So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house; and he was lying down. And she took dough, and
<br> 
<br>kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes. 9And she took the pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said: ‘Have out all men from me.’ And they went out every man from him. 10And Amnon said unto Tamar: ‘Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat of thy hand.’ And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother. 11And when she had brought them near unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her: ‘Come lie with me, my sister.’ 12And she answered him: ‘Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel; do not thou this wanton deed. 13And I, whither shall I carry my shame? and as for thee, thou wilt be as one of the base men in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.’ 14Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice; but being stronger than she, he forced her, and lay with her.
<br>15Then Amnon hated her with exceeding great hatred; for the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her: ‘Arise, be gone.’ 16And she said unto him: ‘Not so, because this great wrong in putting me forth is worse than the other that thou didst unto me.’ But he would not hearken unto her. 17Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said: ‘Put now this woman
<br> 
<br>out from me, and bolt the door after her.’—18Now she had a garment of many colours upon her; for with such robes were the king’s daughters that were virgins apparelled.—And his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her. 19And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of many colours that was on her; and she laid her hand on her head, and went her way, crying aloud as she went.
<br>20And Absalom her brother said unto her: ‘Hath aAmnon thy brother been with thee? but now hold thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother; take not this thing to heart.’ So Tamar remained desolate in her brother, Absalom’s house. 21But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth. 22And Absalom spoke unto Amnon neither good nor bad; for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.
<br>23And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheep- shearers in Baal-hazor, which is beside Ephraim; and Absalom invited all the king’s sons. 24And Absalom came to the king, and said: ‘Behold now, thy servant hath sheep-shearers; let the king, I pray thee, and his servants go with thy servant.’ 25And the king said to Absalom: ‘Nay, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome unto thee.’ And he pressed him; howbeit he would not go, but blessed him. 26Then said Absalom: ‘If not, I pray thee, let
<br>
<br>a Heb. Aminon.
<br> 
<br>my brother Amnon go with us.’ And the king said unto him: ‘Why should he go with thee?’ 27But Absalom pressed him, and he let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with him. 28And Absalom commanded his servants, saying: ‘Mark ye now, when Amnon’s heart is merry with wine; and when I say unto you: Smite Amnon, then kill him, fear not; have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.’ 29And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king’s sons arose, and every man got him up upon his mule, and fled.
<br>30And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that the tidings came to David, saying: ‘Absalom hath slain all the king’s sons, and there is not one of them left.’ 31Then the king arose, and rent his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent. 32And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David’s brother, answered and said: ‘Let not my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the king’s sons; for Amnon only is dead; for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar. 33Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king’s sons are dead; for Amnon only is dead.’
<br>34But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people in a roundabout
<br> 
<br>way by the hill-side. 35And Jonadab said unto the king: ‘Behold, the king’s sons are come; as thy servant said, so it is.’ 36And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king’s sons came, and lifted up their voice, and wept; and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.
<br>37But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And [David] mourned for his son every day.
<br>38So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years. 39And the soul of king David failed with longing for Absalom; for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.
<br>Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king’s heart
<br> 
<br>two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other, and killed him. 7And, behold, the whole family is risen against thy handmaid, and they said: Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he slew, and so destroy the heir also. Thus will they quench my coal which is left, and will leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the face of the earth.’
<br>8And the king said unto the woman: ‘Go to thy house, and I will give charge concerning thee.’ 9And the woman of Tekoa said unto the king: ‘My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father’s house; and the king and his throne be guiltless.’ 10And the king said: ‘Whosoever saith aught unto thee, bring him to me, and he
<br> 
<br>was toward Absalom. 2And Joab sent to Tekoa, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her: ‘I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on mourning apparel, I pray thee, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead; 3and go in to the king, and speak on this manner unto him.’ So Joab put the words in her mouth.
<br>4And when the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and prostrated herself, and said: ‘Help, O king.’ 5And the king said unto her: ‘What aileth thee?’ And she answered: ‘Of a truth I am a widow, my husband being dead. 6And thy handmaid had two sons, and they
<br> 
<br>shall not touch thee any more.’ 11Then said she: ‘I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy God, that the avenger of blood destroy not any more, lest they destroy my son.’ And he said: ‘As the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.’
<br>12Then the woman said: ‘Let thy handmaid, I pray thee, speak a word unto my lord the king.’ And he said: ‘Say on.’ 13And the woman said: ‘Wherefore then hast thou devised such a thing against the people of God? for in speaking this word the king is as one that is guilty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished one. 14For we must needs die,
<br> 
<br>and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect any person; but let him devise means, that he that is banished be not an outcast from him. 15Now therefore seeing that I am come to speak this word unto my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid; and thy handmaid said: I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant. 16For the king will hear, to deliver his servant out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God. 17Then thy handmaid said: Let, I pray thee, the word of my lord the king be for my comfort; for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad; and the LORD thy God be with thee.’
<br>18Then the king answered and said unto the woman: ‘Hide not from me, I pray thee, aught that I shall ask thee.’ And the woman said: ‘Let my lord the king now speak.’ 19And the king said: ‘Is the hand of Joab with thee in all this?’ And the woman answered and said: ‘As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from aught that my lord the king hath spoken; for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thy handmaid; 20to change the face of the matter hath thy servant Joab done this thing; and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom
<br> 
<br>of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.’
<br>21And the king said unto Joab: ‘Behold now, I have granted this request; go therefore, bring the young man Absalom back.’ 22And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and prostrated himself, and blessed the king; and Joab said: ‘To-day thy servant knoweth that I have found favour in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath performed the request of thy servant.’ 23So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem. 24And the king said: ‘Let him turn to his own house, but let him not see my face.’ So Absalom turned to his own house, and saw not the king’s face.
<br>25Now in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty; from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him. 26And when he polled his head—now it was at every year’s end that he polled it; because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it—he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels, after the king’s weight. 27And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar; she was a woman of a fair countenance.
<br>28And Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem; and he saw not the kings face. 29Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king; but he would not come to him; and he sent again a second time, but he would not come. 30Therefore he said unto his servants:
<br> 
<br>‘See, Joab’s field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire.’ And Absalom’s servants set the field on fire. 31Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him: ‘Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?’ 32And Absalom answered Joab: ‘Behold, I sent unto thee, saying: Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say: Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it were better for me to be there still; now therefore let me see the king’s face; and if there be iniquity in me, let him kill me.’ 33So Joab came to the king, and told him; and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king; and the king kissed Absalom.
<br>And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him a
<br>chariot and horses, and fifty men to run before him. 2And Absalom used to rise up early, and stand beside the way of the gate; and it was so, that when any man had a suit which should come to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said: ‘Of what city art thou?’ And he said: ‘Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.’ 3And Absalom said unto him: ‘See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.’ 4Absalom said moreover: ‘Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man who hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice! ’ 5And it was so,
<br> 
<br>that when any man came nigh to prostrate himself before him, he put forth his hand, and took hold of him, and kissed him. 6And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment; so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
<br>7And it came to pass at the end of forty years, that Absalom said unto the king: ‘I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron. 8For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Aram, saying: If the LORD shall indeed bring me back to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.’ 9And the king said unto him: ‘Go in peace.’ So he arose, and went to Hebron. 10But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying: ‘As soon as ye hear the sound of the horn, then ye shall say: Absalom is king in Hebron.’ 11And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were invited, and went in their simplicity; and they knew not any thing. 12And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered the sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.
<br>13And there came a messenger to David, saying: ‘The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.’ 14And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem: ‘Arise, and let us flee; for else none of us shall
<br> 
<br>escape from Absalom; make speed to depart, lest he overtake us quickly, and bring down evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.’ 15And the king’s servants said unto the king: ‘Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall choose.’ 16And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, that were concubines, to keep the house. 17And the king went forth, and all the people after him; and they tarried in Beth- merhak. 18And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men that came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.
<br>19Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite: ‘Wherefore goest thou also with us? return, and abide with the king; for thou art a foreigner, and also an exile from thine own place. 20Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us, seeing I go whither I may? return thou, and take back thy brethren with thee in kindness and truth.’ 21And Ittai answered the king, and said: ‘As the LORD liveth, and as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether for death or for life, even there also will thy servant be.’ 22And David said to Ittai: ‘Go and pass over.’ And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him. 23And all the country
<br> 
<br>wept with a loud voice, as all the people passed over; and as the king passed over the brook Kidron, all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.
<br>24And, lo, Zadok also came, and all the Levites with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God; and they set down the ark of God—but Abiathar went up—until all the people had done passing out of the city. 25And the king said unto Zadok: ‘Carry back the ark of God into the city; if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, He will bring me back, and show me both it, and His habitation; 26but if He say thus: I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I, let Him do to me as seemeth good unto Him.’ 27The king said also unto Zadok the priest: ‘Seest thou? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar. 28See, I will tarry in the plains of the wilderness, until there come word from you to announce unto me.’ 29Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God back to Jerusalem; and they abode there.
<br>30And David went up by the ascent of the mount of Olives, and wept as he went up; and he had his head covered, and went barefoot; and all the people that were with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up. 31And one told David, saying: ‘Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.’ And David said: ‘O LORD, I pray Thee, turn
<br> 
<br>the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.’ 32And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the ascent, where God was wont to be worshipped, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head. 33And David said unto him: ‘If thou passest on with me, then thou wilt be a burden unto Me; 34but if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom: I will be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father’s servant in time past, so will I now be thy servant; then wilt thou defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel. 35And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king’s house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests. 36Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok’s son, and Jonathan Abiathar’s son; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye shall hear.’ 37So Hushai David’s friend came into the city; and Absalom was at the point of coming into Jerusalem.
<br>And when David was a little past the top, behold, Ziba the
<br>servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and a hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine. 2And the king said unto Ziba: ‘What meanest thou by these?’ And Ziba said: ‘The
<br> 
<br>asses are for the king’s household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink.’ 3And the king said: ‘And where is thy master’s son?’ And Ziba said unto the king: ‘Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem; for he said: To-day will the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.’ 4Then said the king to Ziba: ‘Behold, thine is all that pertaineth unto Mephibosheth.’ And Ziba said: ‘I prostrate myself; let me find favour in thy sight, my lord, O king.’
<br>5And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out thence a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera; he came out, and kept on cursing as he came. 6And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David; and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left. 7And thus said Shimei when he cursed: ‘Begone, begone, thou man of blood, and base fellow; 8the LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son; and, behold, thou art taken in thine own mischief, because thou art a man of blood.’
<br>9Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king: ‘Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take
<br> 
<br>off his head.’ 10And the king said: ‘What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? So let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto him: Curse David; who then shall say: Wherefore hast thou done so?’ 11And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants: ‘Behold, my son, who came forth of my body, seeketh my life; how much more this Benjamite now? let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD hath bidden him. 12It may be that the LORD will look on mine eye, and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing of me this day.’ 13So David and his men went by the way; and Shimei went along on the hill-side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust. 14And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary; and he refreshed himself there.
<br>15And Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him. 16And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David’s friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom: ‘Long live the king, long live the king.’ 17And Absalom said to Hushai: ‘Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?’ 18And Hushai said unto Absalom: ‘Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, his will I be, and with him will I abide. 19And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the presence of his son? as I
<br> 
<br>have served in thy father’s presence, so will I be in thy presence.’
<br>20Then said Absalom to Ahithophel: ‘Give your counsel what we shall do.’ 21And Ahithophel said unto Absalom: ‘Go in unto thy father’s concubines, that he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel will hear that thou art abhorred of thy father; then will the hands of all that are with thee be strong.’ 22So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel.— 23Now the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if a man inquired of the word of God; so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.
<br>Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom: ‘Let me now
<br>choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night; 2and I will come upon him while he is weary and weak-handed, and will make him afraid; and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only; 3and I will bring back all the people unto thee; when all shall have returned, [save] the man whom thou seekest, all the people will be in peace.’ 4And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.
<br>5Then said Absalom: ‘Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith.’ 6And when Hushai was come to Absalom,
<br> 
<br>Absalom spoke unto him, saying: ‘Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner; shall we do after his saying? if not, speak thou.’ 7And Hushai said unto Absalom: ‘The counsel that Ahithophel hath given this time is not good.’ 8Hushai said moreover: ‘Thou knowest thy father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are embittered in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field; and thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people. 9Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some place; and it will come to pass, when they fall upon them at the first, and whosoever heareth it shall say: There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom; 10then even he that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, will utterly melt; for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man, and they that are with him are valiant men. 11But I counsel that all Israel be gathered together unto thee, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person. 12So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground; and of him and of all the men that are with him we will not leave so much as one. 13Moreover, if he withdraw himself into a city, then shall all Israel bring up ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the valley until there be not one small stone found there.’ 14And
<br> 
<br>Absalom and all the men of Israel said: ‘The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel.’—For the LORD had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom.
<br>15Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests: ‘Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled. 16Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying: Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but in any wise pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.’ 17Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by En-rogel; and a maid-servant used to go and tell them; and they went and told king David; for they might not be seen to come into the city. 18But a lad saw them, and told Absalom; and they went both of them away quickly, and came to the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a well in his court; and they went down thither. 19And the woman took and spread the covering over the well’s mouth, and strewed groats thereon; and nothing was known. 20And Absalom’s servants came to the woman to the house; and they said: ‘Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?’ And the woman said unto them: ‘They are gone over the brook of water.’ And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.
<br> 
<br>21And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David; and they said unto David: ‘Arise ye, and pass quickly over the water; for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you.’ 22Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over the Jordan; by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over the Jordan.
<br>23And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and got him home, unto his city, and set his house in order, and strangled himself; and he died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father. 24When David was come to Mahanaim, Absalom passed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him. 25And Absalom had set Amasa over the host instead of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of a man, whose name was Ithra the Jesraelite, that went in to Abigal the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab’s mother. 26And Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.
<br>27And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim, 28brought beds, and basins, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and meal, and parched corn, and beans, and lentils, and parched pulse, 29and
<br> 
<br>honey, and curd, and sheep, and cheese of kine, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat; for they said: ‘The people is hungry, and faint, and thirsty, in the wilderness.’
<br>And David numbered the people that were with him, and
<br>set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them. 2And David sent forth the people, a third part under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people: ‘I will surely go forth with you myself also.’ 3But the people said: ‘Thou shalt not go forth; for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us; but thou art worth ten thousand of us: therefore now it is better that thou be ready to succour us out of the city.’ 4And the king said unto them: ‘What seemeth you best I will do.’ And the king stood by the gate-side, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands. 5And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying: ‘Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom.’ And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.
<br>6So the people went out into the field against Israel; and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim. 7And the people of Israel were smitten there before the servants of David, and there
<br> 
<br>was a great slaughter there that day of twenty thousand men. 8For the battle was there spread over the face of all the country; and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.
<br>9And Absalom chanced to meet the servants of David. And Absalom was riding upon his mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great terebinth, and his head caught hold of the terebinth, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went on. 10And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said: ‘Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in a terebinth.’ 11And Joab said unto the man that told him: ‘And, behold, thou sawest it, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have had to give thee ten pieces of silver, and a girdle.’ 12And the man said unto Joab: ‘Though I should receive a thousand pieces of silver in my hand, yet would I not put forth my hand against the king’s son; for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying: Beware that none touch the young man Absalom. 13Otherwise if I had dealt falsely against mine own life—and there is no matter hid from the king—then thou thyself wouldest have stood aloof.’ 14Then said Joab: ‘I may not tarry thus with thee.’ And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the terebinth. 15And ten young men
<br> 
<br>that bore Joab’s armour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.
<br>16And Joab blew the horn, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel; for Joab held back the people. 17And they took Absalom, and cast him into the great pit in the forest, and raised over him a very great heap of stones; and all Israel fled every one to his tent.—18Now Absalom in his life- time had taken and reared up for himself the pillar, which is in the king’s dale; for he said: ‘I have no son to keep my name in remembrance’; and he called the pillar after his own name; and it is called Absalom’s monument unto this day.
<br>19Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok: ‘Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his enemies.’ 20And Joab said unto him: ‘Thou shalt not be the bearer of tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day; but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, forasmuch as the king’s son is dead.’ 21Then said Joab to the Cushite: ‘Go tell the king what thou hast seen.’ And the Cushite bowed down unto Joab, and ran. 22Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab: ‘But come what may, let me, I pray thee, also run after the Cushite.’ And Joab said: ‘Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou wilt have no reward for the tidings?’ 23’But come what may, [said he,] I will run.’ And he said unto him: ‘Run.’ Then Ahimaaz ran by
<br> 
<br>the way of the Plain, and overran the Cushite.
<br>24Now David sat between the two gates; and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone. 25And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said: ‘If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth.’ And he came apace, and drew near. 26And the watchman saw another man running; and the watchman called unto the porter, and said: ‘Behold another man running alone.’ And the king said: ‘He also bringeth tidings.’ 27And the watchman said: ‘I think the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok.’ And the king said: ‘He is a good man, and cometh with good tidings.’
<br>28And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king: ‘All is well.’ And he bowed down before the king with his face to the earth, and said: ‘Blessed be the LORD thy God, who hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.’ 29And the king said: ‘Is it well with the young man Absalom?’ And Ahimaaz answered: ‘When Joab sent the king’s servant, and me thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.’ 30And the king said: ‘Turn aside, and stand here.’ And he turned aside, and stood still.
<br>31And, behold, the Cushite came; and the Cushite said: ‘Tidings for my lord the king; for the LORD hath
<br> 
<br>avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee.’ 32And the king said unto the Cushite: ‘Is it well with the young man Absalom?’ And the Cushite answered: ‘The enemies of my lord the king and all that rise up against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is.’
<br>And	the	king	was	much moved, and   went   up to the chamber over the gate, and wept; and as he went, thus he said: ‘O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would I had died for thee, O Absalom,
<br>my son, my son! ’
<br>2And it was told Joab: ‘Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom.’ 3 And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people; for the people heard say that day: ‘The king grieveth for his son.’ 4And the people got them by stealth that day into the city, as people that are ashamed steal away when they flee in battle. 5And the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice: ‘O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son! ’ 6And Joab came into the house to the king, and said: ‘Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, who this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines; 7in that thou lovest them that hate thee, and hatest them that love thee. For thou hast declared this day, that princes and servants are nought unto thee; for this day I perceive, that if
<br> 
<br>Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well. 8Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak to the heart of thy servants; for I swear by the LORD, if thou go not forth, there will not tarry a man with thee this night; and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that hath befallen thee from thy youth until now.’ 9Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the people, saying: ‘Behold, the king doth sit in the gate’; and all the people came before the king.
<br>Now Israel had fled every man to his tent. 10And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying: ‘The king delivered us out of the hand of our enemies, and he saved us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land from Absalom. 11And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now, therefore, why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?’
<br>12And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying: ‘Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying: Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house?—For the speech of all Israel was come to the king, to bring him to his house.—13Ye are my brethren, ye are my bone and my flesh; wherefore then should ye be the last to bring back the king? 14And say ye to Amasa: Art thou not my bone and my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of
<br> 
<br>Joab.’ 15And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the heart of one man; so that they sent unto the king: ‘Return thou, and all thy servants.’
<br>16So the king returned, and came to the Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to bring the king over the Jordan. 17And Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, who was of Bahurim, made haste and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David. 18And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him. And they rushed into the Jordan before the king. 19And the ferryboat passed to and fro to bring over the king’s household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, when he would go over the Jordan. 20And he said unto the king: ‘Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did iniquitously the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart. 21For thy servant doth know that I have sinned; therefore, behold, I am come this day the first of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.’ 22But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said: ‘Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD’S anointed?’ 23And David said: ‘What have I to do with you, ye sons of
<br> 
<br>Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I am this day king over Israel?’ 24And the king said unto Shimei: ‘Thou shalt not die.’ And the king swore unto him.
<br>25And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king; and he had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came home in peace. 26And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said unto him: ‘Wherefore wentest not thou with me, Mephibosheth?’ 27And he answered: ‘My lord, O king, my servant deceived me; for thy servant said: I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go with the king; because thy servant is lame. 28And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God; do therefore what is good in thine eyes. 29For all my father’s house were deserving of death at the hand of my lord the king; yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet? or why should I cry any more unto the king?’ 30And the king said unto him: ‘Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I say: Thou and Ziba divide the land.’ 31And Mephibosheth said unto the king: ‘Yea, let  him take all, forasmuch as
<br> 
<br>my lord the king is come in peace unto his own house.’
<br>32And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim; and he passed on to Jordan with the king, to bring him on the way over the Jordan. 33Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old; and he had provided the king with sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man. 34And the king said unto Barzillai: ‘Come thou over with me, and I will sustain thee with me in Jerusalem.’ 35And Barzillai said unto the king: ‘How many are the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem? 36I am this day fourscore years old; can I discern between good and bad? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king? 37Thy servant would but just go over the Jordan with the king; and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward? 38Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back, that I may die in mine own city, by the grave of my father and my mother. But behold thy servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto thee.’ 39And the king answered: ‘Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee; and whatsoever thou shalt require of me, that will I do for thee.’ 40And
<br> 
<br>all the people went over the Jordan, and the king went over; and the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto his own place.
<br>41So the king went over to Gilgal, and aChimham went over with him; and all the people of Judah brought the king over, and also half the people of Israel. 42And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto the king: ‘Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and brought the king, and his household, over the Jordan, and all David’s men with him?’ 43And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel: ‘Because the king is near of kin to us; wherefore then are ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all of the king’s cost? or hath any gift been given us?’ 44And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said: ‘We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in David than ye; why then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king?’ And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.
<br>Now there happened to be there a base fellow, whose
<br>name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite; and he blew the horn, and said: ‘We have no portion in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse; every man to his tents, O Israel.’ 2So all the men of Israel went
<br>
<br>a Heb. Chimhan.
<br> 
<br>up from following David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri; but the men of Judah did cleave unto their king, from the Jordan even to Jerusalem.
<br>3And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in ward, and provided them with sustenance, but went not in unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death, in widowhood, with their husband alive.
<br>4Then said the king to Amasa: ‘Call me the men of Judah together within three days, and be thou here present.’ 5So Amasa went to call the men of Judah together; but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him. 6And David said to Abishai: ‘Now will Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom; take thou thy lord’s servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fortified cities, and escape out of our sight.’ 7And there went out after him Joab’s men, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men; and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri. 8When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. And Joab was girded with his apparel of war that he had put on, and thereon was a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out. 9And Joab said to Amasa: ‘Is it well
<br> 
<br>with thee, my brother?’ And Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him. 10But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab’s hand; so he smote him therewith in the groin, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died.
<br>And Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri. 11And there stood by him one of Joab’s young men, and said: ‘He that favoureth Joab, and he that is for David let him follow Joab.’ 12And Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he carried Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a garment over him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still. 13When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.
<br>14And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to Beth- maacah, and all the Berites; and they were gathered together, and went in also after him. 15And they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-maacah, and they cast up a mound against the city, and it stood in the moat; and all the people that were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.
<br>16Then cried a wise woman out of the city: ‘Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto Joab: Come near hither, that I may speak with thee.’ 17And he came
<br> 
<br>near unto her; and the woman said: ‘Art thou Joab?’ And he answered: ‘I am.’ Then she said unto him: ‘Hear the words of thy handmaid.’ And he answered: ‘I do hear.’ 18Then she spoke, saying: ‘They were wont to speak in old time, saying: They shall surely ask counsel at Abel; and so they ended the matter. 19We are of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel; seekest thou to destroy a city and a mother in Israel? why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the LORD?’ 20And Joab answered and said: ‘Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy. 21The matter is not so; but a man of the hill- country of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, even against David; deliver him only, and I will depart from the city.’ And the woman said unto Joab: ‘Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall.’ 22Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and threw it out to Joab. And he blew the horn, and they were dispersed from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king.
<br>23Now Joab was over all the host of Israel; and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites; 24and Adoram was over the levy; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder; 25and Sheva was scribe; and Zadok and Abiathar
<br> 
<br>were priests; 26and Ira also the Jairite was chief minister unto David.
<br>And there was a famine in the days of David three years, year
<br>after year; and David sought the face of the LORD. And the LORD said: ‘It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he put to death the Gibeonites.’ 2And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them—now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them; and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal for the children of Israel and Judah— 3and David said unto the Gibeonites: ‘What shall I do for you? and wherewith shall I make atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of the LORD?’ 4And the Gibeonites said unto him: ‘It is no matter of silver or gold between us and Saul, or his house; neither is it for us to put any man to death in Israel.’ And he said: ‘What say ye that I should do for you?’ 5And they said unto the king: ‘The man that consumed us, and that devised against us, so that we have been destroyed from remaining in any of the borders of Israel, 6let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up unto the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of the LORD.’ And the king said: ‘I will deliver them.’
<br>7But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the LORD’S oath that was between them, between David and
<br> 
<br>Jonathan the son of Saul. 8But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she bore to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite; 9and he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the mountain before the LORD, and they fell all seven together; and they were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, at the beginning of barley harvest.
<br>10And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water was poured upon them from heaven; and she suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night. 11And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done. 12And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh-gilead, who had stolen them from the broad place of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hanged them, in the day that the Philistines slew Saul in Gilboa; 13and he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged. 14And they buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in Zela, in the sepulchre of Kish his father; and they performed all that the
<br> 
<br>king commanded. And after that God was entreated for the land.
<br>15And the Philistines had war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines; and David waxed faint. 16And Ishbibenob, who was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear was three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he being girded with new armour, thought to have slain David. 17But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David swore unto him, saying: ‘Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the lamp of Israel.’
<br>18And it came to pass after this, that there was again war with the Philistines at Gob; then Sibbecai the Hushathite slew Saph, who was of the sons of the giant. 19And there was again war with the Philistines at Gob; and Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim the Beth-lehemite slew Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam. 20And there was again war at Gath, where was a champion, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant. 21And when he taunted Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David’s brother slew him. 22These four were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.
<br> 
<br>And David spoke unto the LORD the words of this song in
<br>the day that the LORD delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul; 2and he said:
<br>The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;
<br>3The God who is my rock, in Him I take refuge;
<br>My shield, and my horn of salvation, my high tower, and my refuge;
<br>My saviour, Thou savest me from violence.
<br>4Praised, I cry, is the LORD,
<br>And I am saved from mine enemies.
<br>
<br>5For the waves of Death compassed me.
<br>The floods of aBelial assailed me. 6The cords of Sheol surrounded me; The snares of Death confronted me. 7In my distress I called upon the
<br>LORD,
<br>Yea, I called unto my God;
<br>And out of His temple He heard my voice,
<br>And my cry did enter into His ears.
<br>8Then the earth did shake and quake,
<br>The foundations of heaven did tremble;
<br>Tey were shaken, because He was wroth.
<br>9Smoke arose up in His nostrils,
<br>And fire out of His mouth did devour;
<br>
<br>a That is, the nether-world.
<br> 
<br>Coals flamed forth from Him.
<br>10He bowed the heavens also, and came down;
<br>And thick darkness was under His feet.
<br>11And He rode upon a cherub, and did fly;
<br>Yea, He was seen upon the wings of the wind.
<br>12And He made darkness pavilions round about Him,
<br>Gathering of waters, thick clouds of the skies.
<br>13At the brightness before Him Coals of fire flamed forth.
<br>14The LORD thundered from heaven,
<br>And the Most High gave forth His voice.
<br>15And He sent out arrows, and scattered them;
<br>Lightning, and discomfited them.
<br>16And the channels of the sea appeared,
<br>The foundations of the world were laid bare
<br>By the rebuke of the LORD,
<br>At the blast of the breath of His nostrils.
<br>
<br>17He sent from on high, He took me; He drew me out of many waters; 18He delivered me from mine enemy
<br>most strong,
<br>From them that hated me, for they were too mighty for me.
<br>19They confronted me in the day of my calamity;
<br>But the LORD was a stay unto me.
<br> 
<br>20He brought me forth also into a large place;
<br>He delivered me, because He delighted in me.
<br>21The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness;
<br>According to the cleanness of my hands hath He recompensed me.
<br>
<br>22For I have kept the ways of the LORD,
<br>And have not wickedly departed from my God.
<br>23For all His ordinances were before me;
<br>And as for His statutes, I did not depart from them.
<br>24And I was single-hearted toward Him,
<br>And I kept myself from mine iniquity.
<br>25Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness,
<br>According to my cleanness in His eyes.
<br>
<br>26With the merciful Thou dost show Thyself merciful,
<br>With the upright man Thou dost show
<br>Thyself upright,
<br>27With the pure Thou dost show Thyself pure;
<br>And with the crooked Thou dost show
<br>Thyself subtle.
<br>28And the afflicted people Thou dost save;
<br> 
<br>But Thine eyes are upon the haughty, that Thou mayest humble them.
<br>
<br>29For Thou art my lamp, O LORD;
<br>And the LORD doth lighten my darkness.
<br>30For by Thee I run upon a troop; By my God do I scale a wall.
<br>31As for God, His way is perfect; The word of the LORD is tried;
<br>He is a shield unto all them that take refuge in Him.
<br>
<br>32For who is God, save the LORD? And who is a Rock, save our God? 33The God who is my strong
<br>fortress,
<br>And who letteth my way go forth straight;
<br>34Who maketh my feet like hinds’,
<br>And setteth me upon my high places;
<br>35Who traineth my hands for war,
<br>So that mine arms do bend a bow of brass.
<br>36Thou hast also given me Thy shield of salvation;
<br>And Thy condescension hath made me great.
<br>37Thou hast enlarged my steps under me,
<br>And my feet have not slipped.
<br>
<br>38I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them;
<br>Neither did I turn back till they were consumed.
<br> 
<br>39And I have consumed them, and smitten them through, that they cannot arise;
<br>Yea, they are fallen under my feet.
<br>40For Thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle;
<br>Thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.
<br>41Thou hast also made mine enemies turn their backs unto me;
<br>Yea, them that hate me, that I might cut them off.
<br>42They looked, but there was none to save;
<br>Even unto the LORD, but He answered them not.
<br>43Then did I beat them small as the dust of the earth,
<br>I did stamp them as the mire of the streets, and did tread them down.
<br>44Thou also hast delivered me from the contentions of my people;
<br>Thou hast kept me to be the head of the nations;
<br>A people whom I have not known serve me.
<br>45The sons of the stranger dwindle away before me;
<br>As soon as they hear of me, they obey me.
<br>46The sons of the stranger fade away,
<br>And come halting out of their close places.
<br>
<br>47The LORD liveth, and blessed be my Rock;
<br>And exalted be the God, my Rock of salvation;
<br> 
<br>48Even the God that executeth vengeance for me,
<br>And bringeth down peoples under me,
<br>49And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies;
<br>Yea, Thou liftest me up above them that rise up against me;
<br>Thou deliverest me from the violent man.
<br>50Therefore I will give thanks unto Thee, O LORD, among the nations,
<br>And will sing praises unto Thy name.
<br>51A tower of salvation is He to His king;
<br>And showeth mercy to His anointed,
<br>To David and to his seed, for evermore.
<br>
<br>Now these are the last words of David:
<br>The saying of David the son of Jesse,
<br>And the saying of the man raised on high,
<br>The anointed of the God of Jacob, And the sweet singer of Israel:
<br>2The spirit of the LORD spoke by me, And His word was upon my tongue.
<br>
<br>3The God of Israel said,
<br>The Rock of Israel spoke to me: ‘Ruler over men shall be
<br>The righteous, even he that ruleth in the fear of God,
<br>4And as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth,
<br>A morning without clouds;
<br> 
<br>When through clear shining after rain,
<br>The tender grass springeth out of the earth.’
<br>5For is not my house established with God?
<br>For an everlasting covenant He hath made with me,
<br>Ordered in all things, and sure;
<br>For all my salvation, and all my desire,
<br>Will he not make it to grow?
<br>6But the ungodly, they are as thorns thrust away, all of them,
<br>For they cannot be taken with the hand;
<br>7But the man that toucheth them Must be armed with iron and the
<br>staff of a spear;
<br>And they shall be utterly burned with fire in their place.
<br>
<br>8These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: Josheb- basshebeth a Tahchemonite, chief of the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite; [he lifted up his spear] against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.
<br>9And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the son of an Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they jeoparded their lives against the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away; 10he stood firm, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand did cleave unto the sword; and the LORD
<br> 
<br>wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to strip the slain.
<br>11And after him was Shammah the son of Age the Ararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a plot of ground full of lentils; and the people fled from the Philistines. 12But he stood in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD wrought a great victory.
<br>13And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam; and the troop of the Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim. 14And David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Beth-lehem. 15And David longed, and said: ‘Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Beth-lehem, which is by the gate! ’ 16And the three mighty men broke through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David; but he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the LORD. 17And he said: ‘Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this; shall I drink the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives?’ therefore he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men.
<br>18And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the three. And he lifted up his spear
<br> 
<br>against three hundred and slew them, and had a name among the three. 19He was most honourable of the three; therefore he was made their captain; howbeit he attained not unto the first three.
<br>20And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, he smote the two altar-hearths of Moab; he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow; 21and he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man; and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and slew him with his own spear. 22These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had a name among the three mighty men. 23He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to the first three. And David set him over his guard.
<br>24Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Beth-lehem; 25Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite; 26Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite; 27Abiezer the Anathothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite; 28Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite; 29Heleb the son of Baanah the Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin; 30Benaiah a Pirathonite, Hiddai of Nahale-gaash; 31Abi-albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite; 32Eliahba the Shaalbonite, of the sons of Jashen, Jonathan; 33Shammah the
<br> 
<br>Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Ararite; 34Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maacathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite; 35Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite; 36Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite; 37Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, armour-bearer to Joab the son of Zeruiah; 38Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite; 39Uriah the Hittite. Thirty and seven in all.
<br>And again the anger of the LORD      was   kindled   against
<br>Israel, and He moved David against them, saying: ‘Go, number Israel and Judah.’ 2And the king said to Joab the captain of the host that was with him: ‘Go now to and fro through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the sum of the people.’ 3And Joab said unto the king: ‘Now the LORD thy God add unto the people, how many soever they may be, a hundredfold, and may the eyes of my lord the king see it; but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing?’ 4Notwithstanding the king’s word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel. 5And they passed over the Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that is in the middle of the valley of Gad, and unto Jazer; 6then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi; and they
<br> 
<br>came to Dan-jaan, and round about to Zidon, 7and came to the stronghold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites; and they went out to the south of Judah, at Beer-sheba. 8So when they had gone to and fro through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days. 9And Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people unto the king; and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.
<br>10And David’s heart smote him after that he had numbered the people. And David said unto the LORD: ‘I have sinned greatly in what I have done; but now, O LORD, put away, I beseech Thee, the iniquity of Thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.’ 11And when David rose up in the morning, the word of the LORD came unto the prophet Gad, David’s seer, saying: 12’Go and speak unto David: Thus saith the LORD: I lay upon thee three things; choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.’ 13So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him: ‘Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before thy foes while they pursue thee? or shall there be three days’pestilence in thy land? now advise thee, and consider what answer I shall return to Him that sent Me.’ 14And David said unto Gad: ‘I am in a great strait; let us fall now into the
<br> 
<br>hand of the LORD; for His mercies are great; and let me not fall into the hand of man.’
<br>15So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed; and there died of the people from Dan even to Beer-sheba seventy thousand men. 16And when the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD repented Him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people: ‘It is enough; now stay thy hand.’ And the angel of the LORD was by the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite. 17And David spoke unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said: ‘Lo, I have sinned, and I have done iniquitously; but these sheep, what have they done? let Thy hand, I pray Thee, be against me, and against my father’s house.’
<br>18And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him: ‘Go up, rear an altar unto the LORD in the threshing- floor of Araunah the Jebusite.’ 19And David went up according to the saying of Gad, as the LORD commanded. 20And Araunah looked forth, and saw the king and his servants coming on
<br> 
<br>toward him; and Araunah went out, and bowed down before the king with his face to the ground. 21And Araunah said: ‘Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant?’ And David said: ‘To buy the threshing-floor of thee, to build an altar unto the LORD, that the plague may be stayed from the people.’ 22And Araunah said unto David: ‘Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him; behold the oxen for the burnt-offering, and the threshing-instruments and the furniture of the oxen for the wood.’ 23All this did Araunah the king give unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king: ‘The LORD thy God accept thee.’ 24And the king said unto Araunah: ‘Nay; but I will verily buy it of thee at a price; neither will I offer burnt-offerings unto the LORD my God which cost me nothing.’ So David bought the threshing-floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver. 25And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings. So the LORD was entreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.

<br>Now King David was old and stricken		in	years;	and	they covered him with clothes, but he could get no heat. 2Wherefore his servants said unto him: ‘Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin; and let her stand before the king, and be a companion unto him; and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat.’ 3So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the borders of Israel,	and		found		Abishag	the Shunammite, and brought her to the king. 4And the damsel was very fair; and she became a companion unto the king, and ministered to him; but the
<br>king knew her not.
<br>5Now Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying: ‘I will be king’; and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him. 6And his father had not grieved him all his life in saying: ‘Why hast thou done so?’ and he was also a very goodly man; and he was born after Absalom. 7And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest; and they following Adonijah helped him. 8But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men that belonged to David, were not with Adonijah. 9And Adonijah slew sheep
<br> 
<br>and oxen and fatlings by the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En-rogel; and he called all his brethren the king’s sons, and all the men of Judah the king’s servants; 10but Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.
<br>11Then Nathan spoke unto Bath- sheba the mother of Solomon, saying: ‘Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not? 12Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon. 13Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him: Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thy handmaid, saying: Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign? 14Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.’
<br>15And Bath-sheba went in unto the king into the chamber.—Now the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the king.—16And Bath-sheba bowed, and prostrated herself unto the king. And the king said: ‘What wouldest thou?’ 17And she said unto him: ‘My lord,
<br> 
<br>thou didst swear by the LORD thy God unto thy handmaid: Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne. 18And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and thou, my lord the king, knowest it not. 19And he hath slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar, the priest, and Joab the captain of the host; but Solomon thy servant hath he not called. 20And thou, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him. 21Otherwise it will come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.’
<br>22And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet came in. 23And they told the king, saying: ‘Behold Nathan the prophet.’ And when he was come in before the king, he bowed down before the king with his face to the ground. 24And Nathan said: ‘My lord, O king, hast thou said: Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? 25For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king’s sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say: Long live king Adonijah. 26But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son
<br> 
<br>of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon hath he not called. 27Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not declared unto thy servant who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?’
<br>28Then king David answered and said: ‘Call me Bath-sheba.’ And she came into the king’s presence, and stood before the king. 29And the king swore and said: ‘As the LORD liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity, 30verily as I swore unto thee by the LORD, the God of Israel, saying: Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; verily so will I do this day.’ 31Then Bath-sheba bowed with her face to the earth, and prostrated herself to the king, and said: ‘Let my lord king David live for ever.’ 32And king David said: ‘Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada.’ And they came before the king. 33And the king said unto them: ‘Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon. 34And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel; and blow ye with the horn, and say: Long live king Solomon. 35Then ye shall come up after him, and he shall come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead; and I have appointed him to be prince over Israel and over Judah.’ 36And Benaiah the son of
<br> 
<br>Jehoiada answered the king, and said: ‘Amen; so say the LORD, the God of my lord the king. 37As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be He with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.’
<br>38So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David’s mule, and brought him to Gihon. 39And Zadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the Tent, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the ram’s horn; and all the people said: ‘Long live king Solomon.’ 40And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.
<br>41And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the horn, he said: ‘Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar?’ 42While he yet spoke, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came; and Adonijah said: ‘Come in; for thou art a worthy man, and bringest good tidings.’ 43And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah: ‘Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king. 44And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and
<br> 
<br>they have caused him to ride upon the king’s mule. 45And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon; and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city is in an uproar. This is the noise that ye have heard. 46And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom. 47And moreover the king’s servants came to bless our lord king David, saying: God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne; and the king bowed down upon the bed. 48And also thus said the king: Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it.’
<br>49And all the guests of Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way. 50And Adonijah feared because of Solomon; and he arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar. 51And it was told Solomon, saying: ‘Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon; for, lo, he hath laid hold on the horns of the altar, saying: Let king Solomon swear unto me first of all that he will not slay his servant with the sword.’ 52And Solomon said: ‘If he shall show himself a worthy man, there shall not a hair of him fall to the earth; but if wickedness be found in him, he shall die.’ 53So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and prostrated himself before king Solomon; and Solomon said unto him: ‘Go to thy house.’
<br> 
<br>Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying: 2’I go the way of all the earth; be thou strong therefore, and show thyself a man; 3and keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in His ways, to keep His statutes, and His commandments, and His ordinances, and His testimonies, according to that which is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself; 4that the LORD may establish His word which		He		spoke	concerning	me, saying: If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before Me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee, said He, a   man   on		the   throne   of	Israel. 5Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did unto me, even what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were		on		his	feet.		6Do	therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace. 7But show kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table; for so they drew nigh unto me when I fled from Absalom thy brother. 8And, behold, there is with thee Shimei the son	of		Gera,		the		Benjamite,		of
<br> 
<br>Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim; but he came down to meet me at the Jordan, and I swore to him by the LORD, saying: I will not put thee to death with the sword. 9Now therefore hold him not guiltless, for thou art a wise man; and thou wilt know what thou oughtest to do unto him, and thou shalt bring his hoar head down to the grave with blood.’
<br>10And David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David. 11And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem. 12And Solomon sat upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established firmly.
<br>13Then Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon. And she said: ‘Comest thou peaceably?’ And he said: ‘Peaceably.’ 14He said moreover: ‘I have somewhat to say unto thee.’ And she said: ‘Say on.’ 15And he said: ‘Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign; howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother’s; for it was his from the LORD. 16And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not.’ And she said unto him: ‘Say on.’ 17And he said: ‘Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king—for he will not say thee nay—that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.’
<br> 
<br>18And Bath-sheba said: ‘Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.’
<br>19Bath-sheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed down unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a throne to be set for the king’s mother; and she sat on his right hand. 20Then she said: ‘I ask one small petition of thee; deny me not.’ And the king said unto her: ‘Ask on, my mother; for I will not deny thee.’ 21And she said: ‘Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife.’ 22And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother: ‘And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.’ 23Then king Solomon swore by the LORD, saying: ‘God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life. 24Now therefore as the LORD liveth, who hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me a house, as He promised, surely Adonijah shall be put to death this day.’ 25And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him, so that he died.
<br>26And unto Abiathar the priest said the king: ‘Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art deserving of death; but I will not at this time put
<br> 
<br>thee to death, because thou didst bear the ark of the Lord GOD before David my father, and because thou wast afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.’ 27So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD; that the word of the LORD might be fulfilled, which He spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.
<br>28And the tidings came to Joab; for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the Tent of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar. 29And it was told king Solomon: ‘Joab is fled unto the Tent of the LORD, and, behold, he is by the altar.’ Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying: ‘Go, fall upon him.’ 30And Benaiah came to the Tent of the LORD, and said unto him: ‘Thus saith the king: Come forth.’ And he said: ‘Nay; but I will die here.’ And Benaiah brought back word unto the king, saying: ‘Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.’ 31And the king said unto him: ‘Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the blood, which Joab shed without cause, from me and from my father’s house. 32And the LORD will return his blood upon his own head, because he fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, and my father David knew it not: Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah. 33So shall
<br> 
<br>their blood return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever; but unto David, and unto his seed, and unto his house, and unto his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the LORD.’ 34Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness. 35And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host; and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.
<br>36And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him: Build thee a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither. 37For on the day thou goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, know thou for certain that thou shalt surely die; thy blood shall be upon thine own head.’ 38And Shimei said unto the king: ‘The saying is good; as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do.’ And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.
<br>39And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish, son of Maacah, king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying: ‘Behold, thy servants are in Gath.’ 40And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish, to seek his servants; and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath. 41And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come back. 42And the king sent and called for Shimei, and
<br> 
<br>said unto him: ‘Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and forewarned thee, saying: Know for certain, that on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any whither, thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me: The saying is good; I have heard it. 43Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?’ 44The king said moreover to Shimei: ‘Thou knowest all the wickedness which thy heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father; therefore the LORD shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head. 45But king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD for ever.’ 46So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he went out, and fell upon him, so that he died.
<br>And the kingdom was established in the	hand	of	Solomon.	1And Solomon	became	allied		to Pharaoh king of Egypt by marriage, and took Pharaoh’s daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem round about. 2Only the people sacrificed in the high places, because there was no house built for the name of the LORD until those days. 3And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father; only he sacrificed
<br>and offered in the high places.
<br> 
<br>4And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place; a thousand burnt-offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar. 5In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night; and God said: ‘Ask what I shall give thee.’ 6And Solomon said: ‘Thou hast shown unto Thy servant David my father great kindness, according as he walked before Thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with Thee; and Thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that Thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day. 7And now, O LORD my God, Thou hast made Thy servant king instead of David my father; and I am but a little child; I know not how to go out or come in. 8And Thy servant is in the midst of Thy people which Thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude. 9Give Thy servant therefore an understanding heart to judge Thy people, that I may discern between good and evil; for who is able to judge this Thy great people?’ 10And the speech pleased the LORD, that Solomon had asked this thing. 11And God said unto him: ‘Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern justice; 12behold, I have done according to thy word: lo, I have given thee a wise and
<br> 
<br>an understanding heart; so that there hath been none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee. 13And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches and honour—so that there hath not been any among the kings like unto thee—all thy days. 14And if thou wilt walk in My ways, to keep My statutes and My commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy days.’ 15And Solomon awoke, and, behold, it was a dream; and he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and offered up burnt-offerings, and offered peace-offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.
<br>16Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king, and stood before him. 17And the one woman said: ‘Oh, my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house. 18And it came to pass the third day after I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also; and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house. 19And this woman’s child died in the night; because she overlay it. 20And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thy handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom. 21And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead; but when I had looked well at it in the morning,
<br> 
<br>behold, it was not my son, whom I did bear.’ 22And the other woman said: ‘Nay; but the living is my son, and the dead is thy son.’ And this said: ‘No; but the dead is thy son, and the living is my son.’ Thus they spoke before the king.
<br>23Then said the king: ‘The one saith: This is my son that liveth, and thy son is the dead; and the other saith: Nay; but thy son is the dead, and my son is the living.’ 24And the king said: ‘Fetch me a sword.’ And they brought a sword before the king. 25And the king said: ‘Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.’ 26Then spoke the woman whose the living child was unto the king, for her heart yearned upon her son, and she said: ‘Oh, my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it.’ But the other said: ‘It shall be neither mine nor thine; divide it.’ 27Then the king answered and said: ‘Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof.’ 28And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king; for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do justice.
<br>And king Solomon was king over all Israel. 2And these were the princes whom he had: Azariah the son of Zadok, the priest; 3Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder; 4and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host; and Zadok and	Abiathar	were	priests;	5and
<br> 
<br>Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers; and Zabud the son of Nathan was chief minister and the king’s friend; 6and Ahishar was over the household; and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the levy.
<br>7And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, who provided victuals for the king and his household: each man had to make provision for a month in the year. 8And these are their names: The son of Hur, in the hill- country of Ephraim; 9the son of Deker, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth- shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan; 10the son of Hesed, in Arubboth; to him pertained Socoh, and all the land of Hepher; 11the son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; he had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife; 12Baana the son of Ahilud, in Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth-shean which is beside Zarethan, beneath Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah, as far as beyond Jokmeam; 13the son of Geber, in Ramoth-gilead; to him pertained the villages of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; even to him pertained the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore great cities with walls and brazen bars; 14Ahinadab the son of Iddo, in Mahanaim; 15Ahimaaz, in Naphtali; he also took Basemath the daughter of Solomon to wife; 16Baana the son of Hushai, in Asher and Bealoth; 17Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar; 18Shimei the son of Ela, in Benjamin; 19Geber the son of Uri, in
<br> 
<br>the land of Gilead, the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan; and one officer that was [over all the officers] in the land. 20Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking and making merry. And Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border	of	Egypt;	they	brought presents, and served Solomon all the
<br>days of his life.
<br>2And Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal; 3ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and a hundred sheep, beside harts, and gazelles, and roebucks, and fatted fowl. 4For he had dominion over all the region on this side the River, from Tiphsah even to Gaza, over all the kings on this side the River; and he had peace on all sides round about him. 2And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig-tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon.
<br>6And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. 2And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomon’s table, every man in his month; they let nothing be lacking. 8Barley also and straw for the horses and swift steeds brought they unto the place where it should be, every man according to his charge.
<br> 
<br>9And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea-shore. 10And Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east, and all the wisdom of Egypt. 11For he was wiser than all men: than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol; and his fame was in all the nations round about. 12And he spoke three thousand proverbs; and his songs were a thousand and five. 13And he spoke of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall; he spoke also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes. 14And there came of all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, who had heard of his wisdom.
<br>15And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father; for Hiram was ever a lover of David. 16And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying: 17‘Thou knowest how that David my father could not build a house for the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of my feet. 18But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side; there is neither adversary, nor evil occurrence. 19And, behold, I purpose to build a house for the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spoke unto
<br> 
<br>David my father, saying: Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build the house for My name. 20Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar-trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants; and I will give thee hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt say; for thou knowest that there is not among us any that hath skill to hew timber like unto the Zidonians.’
<br>21And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said: ‘Blessed be the LORD this day, who hath given unto David a wise son over this great people.’ 22And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying: ‘I have heard that which thou hast sent unto me; I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of cypress. 23My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea; and I will make them into rafts to go by sea unto the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be broken up there, and thou shalt receive them; and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.’ 24So aHiram gave Solomon timber of cedar and timber of cypress according to all his desire. 25And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of beaten oil; thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year. 26And
<br>
<br>a Heb. Hirom, and in verse 32.
<br> 
<br>the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as He promised him; and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together.
<br>27And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men. 28And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses: a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home; and Adoniram was over the levy. 29And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bore burdens, and fourscore thousand that were hewers in the mountains; 30besides Solomon’s chief officers that were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, who bore rule over the people that wrought in the work. 31And the king commanded, and they quarried great stones, costly stones, to lay the foundation of the house with hewn stone. 32And Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders and the Gebalites did fashion them, and prepared the timber and the stones to build the house.
<br>And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after
<br>the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month Ziv, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD. 2And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits. 3And the
<br> 
<br>porch before the atemple of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house. 4And for the house he made windows broad within, and narrow without. 5And against the wall of the house he built a side-structure round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of bthe sanctuary; and he made side-chambers round about; 6the nethermost story of the side-structure was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad; for on the outside he made rebatements in the wall of the house round about, that the beams should not have hold in the walls of the house.— 7For the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready at the quarry; and there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.— 8The door for the clowest row of chambers was in the right side of the house and they went up by winding stairs into the middle row, and out of the middle into the third. 9So he built the house, and finished it; and he covered in the house with planks of cedar over beams. 10And he built the stories of the side- structure against all the house, each

<br>b Heb. debir, that is, the hindmost or innermost room, the most holy place.
<br>c Heb. middle.
<br> 
<br>five cubits high; and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.
<br>11And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying: 12’As for this house which thou art building, if thou wilt walk in My statutes, and execute Mine ordinances, and keep all My commandments to walk in them; then will I establish My word with thee, which I spoke unto David thy father; 13in that I will dwell therein among the children of Israel, and will not forsake My people Israel.’
<br>14So Solomon built the house, and finished it. 15And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar; from the floor of the house unto the joists of the ceiling, he covered them on the inside with wood; and he covered the floor of the house with boards of cypress. 16And he built twenty cubits on the hinder part of the house with boards of cedar from the floor unto the joists; he even built them for himself within, for a Sanctuary, even for the most holy place. 17And the house, that is, the temple before [the Sanctuary], was forty cubits long. 18And the cedar on the house within was carved with knops and open flowers; all was cedar; there was no stone seen. 19And he prepared the Sanctuary in the midst of the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD. 20And before the Sanctuary which was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof, overlaid with pure gold, he set an altar,
<br> 
<br>which he covered with cedar. 21So Solomon overlaid athe house within with pure gold; and he drew chains of gold across the wall before the Sanctuary; and he overlaid it with gold. 22And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until all the house was finished; also the whole altar that belonged to the Sanctuary he overlaid with gold.
<br>23And in the Sanctuary he made two cherubim of olive-wood, each ten cubits high. 24And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub; from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits. 25And the other cherub was ten cubits; both the cherubim were of one measure and one form. 26The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub. 27And he set the cherubim within the inner house; and the wings of the cherubim were stretched forth, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house. 28And he overlaid the cherubim with gold.
<br>29And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubim and palm-trees and open flowers, within and without. 30And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without. 31And for the
<br>
<br>a That is, the Sanctuary.
<br> 
<br>entrance of the Sanctuary he made doors of olive-wood, the door-posts within the frame having five angles. 32And as for the two doors of olive- wood, he carved upon them carvings of cherubim and palm-trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold; and he spread the gold upon the cherubim, and upon the palm-trees. 33So also made he for the entrance of the temple door-posts of olive-wood, within a frame four-square; 34and two doors of cypress-wood; the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding. 35And he carved thereon cherubim and palm-trees and open flowers; and he overlaid them with gold fitted upon the graven work. 36And he built the inner court with three rows of hewn stone, and a row of cedar beams.
<br>37In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in the month Ziv. 38And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it.
<br>
<br>And Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he
<br>finished all his house.
<br>2For he built the house of the forest of Lebanon: the length thereof was a hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof
<br> 
<br>thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars. 3And it was covered with cedar above upon the side-chambers, that lay on forty and five pillars, fifteen in a row. 4And there were beams in three rows; and light was over against light in three ranks. 5And all the doors with their posts were square in the frame; and light was over against light in three ranks.
<br>6And he made the porch of pillars: the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits; and a porch before them; and pillars and thick beams before them.
<br>7And he made the porch of the throne where he might judge, even the porch of judgment; and it was covered with cedar from floor to floor.
<br>8And his house where he might dwell, in the other court, within the porch, was of the like work. He made also a house for Pharaoh’s daughter, whom Solomon had taken to wife, like unto this porch.
<br>9All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of hewn stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside unto the great court. 10And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits. 11And above were costly stones, after the measure of hewn stones, and cedar-wood. 12And the great court round about had three rows of hewn stone, and a row of
<br> 
<br>cedar beams, like as the inner court of the house of the LORD, and the court of the porch of the house.
<br>13And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre. 14He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass; and he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill, to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work.
<br>15Thus he fashioned the two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high each; and a line of twelve cubits did compass it about; [and so] the other pillar. 16And he made two capitals of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars; the height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits. 17He also made nets of checker-work, and wreaths of chain-work, for the capitals which were upon the top of the pillars: seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital. 18And he made the pillars; and there were two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the capitals that were upon the top of the pomegranates; and so did he for the other capital. 19And the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars in the porch were of lily-work, four cubits. 20And there were capitals above also upon the two pillars, close by the belly which was beside the network; and the pomegranates were two hundred, in rows round about upon each capital. 21And he set up the pillars
<br> 
<br>at the porch of the temple; and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin; and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz. 22And upon the top of the pillars was lily-work; so was the work of the pillars finished.
<br>23And he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and the height thereof was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about. 24And under the brim of it round about there were knops which did compass it, for ten cubits, compassing the sea round about; the knops were in two rows, cast when it was cast. 25It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea was set upon them above, and all their hinder parts were inward. 26And it was a hand-breadth thick; and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily; it held two thousand baths.
<br>27And he made the ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it. 28And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders; and there were borders between the stays; 29and on the borders that were between the stays were lions, oxen, and cherubim; and upon the stays it was in like manner above; and beneath the
<br> 
<br>lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work. 30And every base had four brazen wheels, and axles of brass; and the four feet thereof had undersetters; beneath the laver were the undersetters molten, with wreaths at the side of each. 31And the mouth of it within the crown and above was a cubit high; and the mouth thereof was round after the work of a pedestal, a cubit and a half; and also upon the mouth of it were gravings; and their borders were foursquare, not round. 32And the four wheels were underneath the borders; and the axletrees of the wheels were in the base; and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit. 33And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel; their axletrees, and their felloes, and their spokes, and their naves, were all molten. 34And there were four undersetters at the four corners of each base; the undersetters thereof were of one piece with the base itself. 35And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high; and on the top of the base the stays thereof and the borders thereof were of one piece therewith. 36And on the plates of the stays thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubim, lions, and palm-trees, according to the space of each, with wreaths round about. 37After this manner he made the ten bases; all of them had one casting, one measure, and one form.
<br>38And he made ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths; and
<br> 
<br>every laver was four cubits; and upon every one of the ten bases one laver. 39And he set the bases, five on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house; and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward, toward the south.
<br>40And aHiram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basins.
<br>So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he wrought for king Solomon in the house of the LORD: 41the two pillars, and the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars; and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars; 42and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars; 43and the ten bases, and the ten lavers on the bases; 44and the one sea, and the twelve oxen under the sea; 45and the pots, and the shovels, and the basins; even all these vessels, which Hiram made for king Solomon, in the house of the LORD, were of burnished brass. 46In the plain of the Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan. 47And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many; the weight of the brass could not be found out. 48And Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of the LORD: the
<br>
<br>a Heb. Hirom.
<br> 
<br>golden altar, and the table whereupon the showbread was, of gold; 49and the candlesticks, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the Sanctuary, of pure gold; and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold; 50and the cups, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the pans, and the fire-pans, of pure gold; and the hinges, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, that is, of the temple, of gold.
<br>51Thus all the work that king Solomon wrought in the house of the LORD was finished. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated, the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of the house of the LORD.
<br>Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads
<br>of the tribes, the princes of the fathers’houses of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion. 2And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast, in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month. 3And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark. 4And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; even these did the priests and the Levites bring up. 5And king Solomon and all the congregation of Israel,  that were
<br> 
<br>assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude. 6And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto its place, into the Sanctuary of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim. 7For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the staves thereof above. 8And the staves were so long that the ends of the staves were seen from the holy place, even before the Sanctuary; but they could not be seen without; and there they are unto this day. 9There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel when they came out of the land of Egypt. 10And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD, 11so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud; for the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD.
<br>12Then spoke Solomon:
<br>The LORD hath said that He would dwell in the thick darkness.
<br>13I have surely built Thee a house of habitation,
<br>A place for Thee to dwell in for ever.
<br>14And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel; and all the congregation of
<br> 
<br>Israel stood. 15And he said: ‘Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who spoke with His mouth unto David my father, and hath with His hand fulfilled it, saying: 16Since the day that I brought forth My people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house, that My name might be there; but I chose David to be over My people Israel. 17Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel. 18But the LORD said unto David my father: Whereas it was in thy heart to build a house for My name, thou didst well that it was in thy heart; 19nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for My name. 20And the LORD hath established His word that He spoke; for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built the house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel. 21And there have I set a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of the LORD, which He made with our fathers, when He brought them out of the land of Egypt.’
<br>22And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven; 23and he said: ‘O LORD, the God of Israel, there is no God like Thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath; who keepest covenant and mercy with Thy
<br> 
<br>servants, that walk before Thee with all their heart; 24who hast kept with Thy servant David my father that which Thou didst promise him; yea, Thou spokest with Thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with Thy hand, as it is this day. 25Now therefore, O LORD, the God of Israel, keep with Thy servant David my father that which Thou hast promised him saying: There shall not fail thee a man in My sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only thy children take heed to their way, to walk before Me as thou hast walked before Me. 26Now therefore, O God of Israel, let Thy word, I pray Thee, be verified, which Thou didst speak unto Thy servant David my father.
<br>27But will God in very truth dwell on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain Thee; how much less this house that I have builded! 28Yet have Thou respect unto the prayer of Thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer which Thy servant prayeth before Thee this day; 29that Thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place whereof Thou hast said: My name shall be there; to hearken unto the prayer which Thy servant shall pray toward this place. 30And hearken Thou to the supplication of Thy servant, and of Thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place; yea, hear Thou in heaven Thy dwelling-place; and when Thou hearest, forgive.
<br> 
<br>31If a man sin against his neighbour, and an oath be exacted of him to cause him to swear, and he come and swear before Thine altar in this house; 32then hear Thou in heaven, and do, and judge Thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his own head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.
<br>33When Thy people Israel are smitten down before the enemy, when they do sin against Thee, if they turn again to Thee, and confess Thy name, and pray and make supplication unto Thee in this house; 34then hear Thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of Thy people Israel, and bring them back unto the land which Thou gavest unto their fathers.
<br>35When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, when they do sin against Thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess Thy name, and turn from their sin, when Thou dost afflict them; 36then hear Thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of Thy servants, and of Thy people Israel, when Thou teachest them the good way wherein they should walk; and send rain upon Thy land, which Thou hast given to Thy people for an inheritance.
<br>37If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting or mildew, locust or caterpillar; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness there be; 38what prayer and supplication soever be
<br> 
<br>made by any man of all Thy people Israel, who shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house; 39then hear Thou in heaven Thy dwelling-place, and forgive, and do, and render unto every man according to all his ways, whose heart Thou knowest—for Thou, even Thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men— 40that they may fear Thee all the days that they live in the land which Thou gavest unto our fathers.
<br>41Moreover concerning the stranger that is not of Thy people Israel, when he shall come out of a far country for Thy name’s sake— 42for they shall hear of Thy great name, and of Thy mighty hand, and of Thine outstretched arm—when he shall come and pray toward this house; 43hear Thou in heaven Thy dwelling-place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to Thee for; that all the peoples of the earth may know Thy name, to fear Thee, as doth Thy people Israel, and that they may know that Thy name is called upon this house which I have built.
<br>44If Thy people go out to battle against their enemy, by whatsoever way Thou shalt send them, and they pray unto the LORD toward the city which Thou hast chosen, and toward the house which I have built for Thy name; 45then hear Thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause. 46If they sin against Thee—for there is no man that
<br> 
<br>sinneth not—and Thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive unto the land of the enemy, far off or near; 47yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive, and turn back, and make supplication unto Thee in the land of them that carried them captive, saying: We have sinned, and have done iniquitously, we have dealt wickedly; 48if they return unto Thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies, who carried them captive, and pray unto Thee toward their land, which Thou gavest unto their fathers, the city which Thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for Thy name; 49then hear Thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven Thy dwelling- place, and maintain their cause; 50and forgive Thy people who have sinned against Thee, and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against Thee; and give them compassion before those who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them; 51for they are Thy people, and Thine inheritance, which Thou broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron; 52that Thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of Thy servant, and unto the supplication of Thy people Israel, to hearken unto them whensoever they cry unto Thee. 53For Thou didst set them apart from among all the peoples of the earth, to be Thine
<br> 
<br>inheritance, as Thou didst speak by the hand of Moses Thy servant, when Thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord GOD.’
<br>54And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the LORD, he arose from before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread forth toward heaven. 55And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying: 56’Blessed be the LORD, that hath given rest unto His people Israel, according to all that He promised; there hath not failed one word of all His good promise, which He promised by the hand of Moses His servant. 57The LORD our God be with us, as He was with our fathers; let Him not leave us, nor forsake us; 58that He may incline our hearts unto Him, to walk in all His ways, and to keep His commandments, and His statutes, and His ordinances, which He commanded our fathers. 59And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before the LORD, be nigh unto the LORD our God day and night, that He maintain the cause of His servant, and the cause of His people Israel, as every day shall require; 60that all the peoples of the earth may know that the LORD, He is God; there is none else. 61Let your heart therefore be whole with the LORD our God, to walk in His statutes, and to keep His commandments, as at this day.’ 62And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the
<br> 
<br>LORD. 63And Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which he offered unto the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD. 64The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD; for there he offered the burnt- offering, and the meal-offering, and the fat of the peace-offerings; because the brazen altar that was before the LORD was too little to receive the burnt-offering, and the meal-offering, and the fat of the peace-offerings.
<br>65So Solomon held the feast at that time, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entrance Hamath unto the Brook of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days. 66On the eighth day he sent the people away, and they blessed the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had shown unto David His servant, and to Israel His people.
<br>And it came to pass, when Solomon	had	finished	the building of the house of the LORD, and the king’s house, and all Solomon’s delight which he was pleased to do, 2that the LORD appeared to Solomon the second time, as He had appeared unto him at Gibeon. 3And the LORD said unto him: ‘I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication, that thou hast made before Me: I have hallowed this
<br> 
<br>house, which thou hast built, to put My name there for ever; and Mine eyes and My heart shall be there perpetually. 4And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before Me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep My statutes and Mine ordinances; 5then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom over Israel for ever; according as I promised to David thy father, saying: There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel. 6But if ye shall turn away from following Me, ye or your children, and not keep My commandments and My statutes which I have set before you, but shall go and serve other gods, and worship them; 7then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for My name, will I cast out of My sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a by word among all peoples; 8and this house which is so high [shall become desolate], and every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and when they shall say: Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and to this house? 9they shall be answered: Because they forsook the LORD their God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them; therefore hath the LORD brought all this evil upon them.’
<br> 
<br>10And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD and the king’s house—11now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar-trees and cypress- trees, and with gold, according to all his desire—that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee. 12And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him: and they pleased him not. 13And he said: ‘What cities are these which thou hast given me, my brother?’ And they were called the land of Cabul, unto this day. 14And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold. 15And this is the account of the levy which king Solomon raised; to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer. 16Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it for a portion unto his daughter, Solomon’s wife. 17And Solomon built Gezer, and Beth-horon the nether, 18and Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land, 19and all the store-cities that Solomon had, and the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion. 20All the people that were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites,
<br> 
<br>the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of the children of Israel; 21even their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel were not able utterly to destroy, of them did Solomon raise a levy of bondservants, unto this day. 22But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondservants; but they were the men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen.
<br>23These were the chief officers that were over Solomon’s work, five hundred and fifty, who bore rule over the people that wrought in the work.
<br>24But Pharaoh’s daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house which [Solomon] had built for her; then did he build Millo.
<br>25And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt-offerings and peace-offerings upon the altar which he built unto the LORD, offering thereby, upon the altar that was before the LORD. So he finished the house. 26And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion-geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom. 27And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon. 28And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.
<br>And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon
<br> 
<br>because of the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with hard questions. 2And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bore spices and gold very much, and precious stones; and when she was come to Solomon, she spoke with him of all that was in her heart. 3And Solomon told her all her questions; there was not any thing hid from the king which he told her not. 4And when the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built, 5and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his burnt-offering which he offered in the house of the LORD, there was no more spirit in her. 6And she said to the king: ‘It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom. 7Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it; and, behold, the half was not told me; thou hast wisdom and prosperity exceeding the fame which I heard. 8Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, that stand continually before thee, and that hear thy wisdom. 9Blessed be the LORD thy God, who delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel; because the LORD loved Israel for ever, therefore made He thee king, to do justice and righteousness.’ 10And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones; there
<br> 
<br>came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon. 11And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of sandal-wood and precious stones. 12And the king made of the sandal-wood pillars for the house of the LORD, and for the king’s house, harps also and psalteries for the singers; there came no such sandal- wood, nor was seen, unto this day. 13And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her servants.
<br>14Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold, 15beside that which came of the merchants, and of the traffic of the traders, and of all the kings of the mingled people and of the governors of the country. 16And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of gold went to one target. 17And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold: three pounds of gold went to one shield; and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
<br>18Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the finest gold. 19There were six steps to the throne, and the top of the throne was round behind; and there were arms on either side by the place of the
<br> 
<br>seat, and two lions standing beside the arms. 20And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps; there was not the like made in any kingdom.
<br>21And all king Solomon’s drinking- vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none were of silver; it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon. 22For the king had at sea a navy of Tarshish with the navy of Hiram; once every three years came the navy of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
<br>23So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom. 24And all the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart. 25And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, and armour, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.
<br>26And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen; and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem. 27And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycamore-trees that are in the Lowland, for abundance. 28And the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt; also out of Keveh, the king’s merchants buying
<br> 
<br>them of the men of Keveh at a price. 29And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty; and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Aram, did they bring them out by their means.
<br>Now king Solomon loved many foreign women, besides
<br>the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites; 2of the nations concerning which the LORD said unto the children of Israel: ‘Ye shall not go among them, neither shall they come among you; for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods’; Solomon did cleave unto these in love. 3And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his wives turned away his heart. 4For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods; and his heart was not whole with the LORD his God, as was the heart of David his father. 5For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the detestation of the Ammonites. 6And Solomon

<br>PREFACE
<br>The following is from the preface to the Jewish Publication Society's 1917 edition of the Hebrew Bible in English:
<br>The sacred task of translating the Word of God, as revealed to Israel through lawgiver, prophet, psalmist, and sage, began at an early date. According to an ancient rabbinic interpretation, Joshua had the Torah engraved upon the stones of the altar (Joshua 8:32) not in the original Hebrew alone, but in all the languages of mankind, which were held to be seventy, in order that all men might become acquainted with the words of the Scriptures. This statement, with its universalistic tendency, is, of course, a reflex of later times, when the Hebrew Scriptures had become a subject of curiosity and perhaps also of anxiety to the pagan or semi-pagan world.
<br>While this tradition contains an element of truth, it is certain that the primary object of translating the Bible was to minister to a need nearer home. Upon the establishment of the Second Commonwealth under Ezra and Nehemiah, it became imperative to make the Torah of God 'distinct and giving sense' through the means of interpretation (Nehemiah 8:8 and 13:24), that the Word of God might be understood by all the people. The Rabbis perceived in this activity of the first generation of the Sopherim the origin of the Aramaic translation known as the Targum, first made orally and afterwards committed to writing, which was necessitated by the fact that Israel had forgotten the sacred language, and spoke the idiom current in a large part of western Asia. All this, however, is veiled in obscurity, as is the whole inner history of the Jews during the Persian rule.
<br>The historic necessity for translation was repeated with all the great changes in Israel's career. It is enough to point to the Septuagint, or the Greek translation of the Scriptures, the product of Israel's contact with the Hellenistic civilization dominating the world at that time; to the Arabic translation by the Gaon Saadya, when the great majority of the Jewish people came under the sceptre of Mohammedan rulers; and to the German translation by Mendelssohn and his school, at the dawn of a new epoch, which brought the Jews in Europe, most of whom spoke a German dialect, into closer contact with their neighbours. These translations are all historical products intimately connected with Israel's wanderings among the nations and with the great events of mankind in general.
<br>Ancient and continuous as this task of translation was, it would be a mistake to think that there were no misgivings about it. At least it is certain that opinions
<br> 
<br>were divided as to the desirability of such undertakings. While Philo and his Alexandrian coreligionists looked upon the translation of the Seventy as a work of inspired men, the Palestinian Rabbis subsequently considered the day on which the Septuagint was completed as one of the most unfortunate in Israel's history, seeing that the Torah could never be adequately translated. And there are indications enough that the consequences of such translations were not all of a desirable nature. However, in view of the eagerness with which they were undertaken almost in every land and in every great epoch of the world's history, it is evident that the people at large approved of such translations, thinking them to be a heave-offering to the Lord of each newly acquired vernacular adopted in the course of the ever-changing conditions of history, and in particular a tribute to the beauty of Japheth dwelling in the spiritual tents of Israel.
<br>The greatest change in the life of Israel during the last two generations was his renewed acquaintance with English-speaking civilization. Out of a handful of immigrants from Central Europe and the East who saw the shores of the New World, or even of England and her colonies, we have grown under Providence both in numbers and in importance, so that we constitute now the greatest section of Israel living in a single country outside of Russia. We are only following in the footsteps of our great predecessors when, with the growth of our numbers, we have applied ourselves to the sacred task of preparing a new translation of the Bible into the English language, which, unless all signs fail, is to become the current speech of the majority of the children of Israel.
<br>The need of such a translation was felt long ago. Mention may here be made of the work of Isaac Leeser in America, which was both preceded and followed by two translations produced in England: the one by Dr. A. Benisch, the other by Dr. Michael Friedlander. The most popular, however, among these translations was that of Lesser, which was not only the accepted version in all the synagogues of the United States, but was also reproduced in England. Its great merit consisted in the fact that it incorporated all the improvements proposed by the Mendelssohn School and their successors, whose combined efforts were included and further developed in the so-called Zunz Bible, which enjoyed a certain authority among German Jews for several generations. With the advance of time and the progress made in almost all departments of Bible study, it was found that Leeser's translation would bear improvement and recasting.
<br>Steps leading to the preparation of a new translation into the English language were taken by the Jewish Publication Society of America in 1892. It was intended to secure, if possible, through the co-operation of scholars in the United States and in Great Britain, a new translation of each book, and to place it in the
<br> 
<br>hands of an Editorial Committee, who by correspondence with the translators should harmonize the results of the work of the individual contributors. This method was followed until 1901 under the general direction of Doctor Marcus Jastrow, Editor-in-Chief, with Doctor Kaufman Kohler and Doctor Frederick de Sola Mendes as the other members of the Editorial Committee.*
<br>*There is given herewith a list of the translations prepared for the Society: Genesis, Max Landsberg, Rochester, N. Y.
<br>Exodus and Leviticus, L. N. Dembitz (deceased), Louisville, Ky. Numbers, David Philipson, Cincinnati, Ohio.
<br>Deuteronomy, F. de Sola Mendes, New York. Joshua, Joseph H. Hertz, London, England.
<br>Judges, Stephen S. Wise, New York.
<br>II Samuel, Bernard Drachman, New York.
<br>Jeremiah, Sabato Morais (deceased), Philadelphia, Pa. Ezekiel, Henry W. Schneeberger, Baltimore, Md.
<br>Joel, Oscar Cohen (deceased), Mobile, Ala. Amos, H. Pereira Mendes, Now York.
<br>Obadiah and Jonah, J. Voorsanger (deceased), San Francisco, California. Micah, Maurice H. Harris, New York.
<br>Nahum, L. Mayer (deceased), Pittsburgh, Pa. Zephaniah, M. Schlesinger, Albany, N. Y. Haggai, S. Mendelsohn, Wilmington, N. C. Malachi, D. Davidson, New York.
<br>Job, Marcus Jastrow (deceased), Philadelphia, Pa. Ruth, Joseph Krauskopf, Philadelphia, Pa.
<br>Ecclesiastes, Gustav Gottheil (deceased), New York. Esther, William Rosenau, Baltimore, Md.
<br>I and II Chronicles, M. Mielziner (deceased), Cincinnati, Ohio.)
<br>It became apparent in 1901 that by this procedure the publication of a translation of the entire Hebrew Bible would be indefinitely delayed, and accordingly the Book of Psalms, translated by Doctor Kohler and revised by his colleagues, was given to the press and issued in 1903. The death of Doctor Jastrow in that year required the formation of a new committee under the chairmanship of Doctor Solomon Schechter. This committee, however, soon found that the method adopted was too complex, and that it was impossible to accomplish by correspondence the extensive work required.
<br>In 1908 the Jewish Publication Society of America and the Central Conference of American Rabbis reached an agreement to cooperate in bringing out the new
<br> 
<br>translation upon a revised plan of having the entire work done by a Board of Editors instead of endeavoring to harmonize the translations of individual contributors. As a result of this understanding the present Board, composed of Doctor Solomon Schechter, Doctor Cyrus Adler, and Doctor Joseph Jacobs, representing the Jewish Publication Society of America, and Doctor Kaufman Kohler, Doctor David Philipson, and Doctor Samuel Schulman, representing the Central Conference of American Rabbis, was constituted, and by mutual agreement Professor Max L. Margolis was chosen as the seventh member, he to be the Editor-in-Chief of the work and Secretary to the Editorial Board, of which Doctor Cyrus Adler was elected Chairman. Incidentally the selection thus made resulted in an equal representation of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America at New York, of the Hebrew Union College at Cincinnati, and of the Dropsie College for Hebrew and Cognate Learning at Philadelphia. For one year Professor Israel Friedlaender acted as a member of the Board in the stead of Doctor Schechter.
<br>The method employed by the Board was as follows:
<br>In preparing the manuscript for consideration by the Board of Editors, Professor Margolis took into account the existing English versions, the standard commentaries, ancient and modern, the translations already made for the Jewish Publication Society of America, the divergent renderings from the Revised Version prepared for the Jews of England, the marginal notes of the Revised Version, and the changes of the American Committee of Revisers. Due weight was given to the ancient versions as establishing a tradition of interpretation, notably the Septuagint and the versions of Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion, the Targums, the Peshitta, the Vulgate, and the Arabic version of Saadya. Talmudic and midrashic allusions and all available Jewish commentators, both the great medieval authorities, like Rashi, Kimhi, and Ibn Ezra, and the moderns
<br>S. D. Luzzatto, Malbim, and Ehrlich, as well as all the important non-Jewish commentators, were consulted. On this basis, a manuscript was prepared by the Editor-in-Chief and a copy sent to every member of the Board of Editors. Sixteen meetings, covering a period of seven years and occupying one hundred and sixty working days, were held, at which the proposals in this manuscript and many additional suggestions by the members of the Board were considered. Each point was thoroughly discussed, and the view of the majority was incorporated into the manuscript. When the Board was evenly divided, the Chairman cast the deciding vote. From time to time subcommittees were at work upon points left open, and their reports, submitted to the Board, were discussed and voted upon. The proof of the entire work was sent to each member of the Board for revision, and the new proposals which were made by one or another were in turn submitted to a
<br> 
<br>vote by correspondence and to a final vote at the last meeting of the Board, held in October-November, 1915.
<br>The present translation is the first for which a group of men representative of Jewish learning among English-speaking Jews assume joint responsibility, all previous efforts in the English language having been the work of individual translators. It has a character of its own. It aims to combine the spirit of Jewish tradition with the results of biblical scholarship, ancient, medieval, and modern. It gives to the Jewish world a translation of the Scriptures done by men imbued with the Jewish consciousness, while the non-Jewish world, it is hoped, will welcome a translation that presents many passages from the Jewish traditional point of view.
<br>The repeated efforts by Jews in the field of biblical translation show their sentiment toward translations prepared by other denominations. The dominant feature of this sentiment, apart from the thought that the christological interpretations in non-Jewish translations are out of place in a Jewish Bible, is and was that the Jew cannot afford to have his Bible translation prepared for him by others. He cannot have it as a gift, even as he cannot borrow his soul from others. If a new country and a new language metamorphose him into a new man, the duty of this new man is to prepare a new garb and a new method of expression for what is most sacred and most dear to him.
<br>We are, it is hardly needful to say, deeply grateful for the works of our non- Jewish predecessors, such as the Authorised Version with its admirable diction, which can never be surpassed, as well as for the Revised Version with its ample learning--but they are not ours. The Editors have not only used these famous English versions, but they have gone back to the earlier translations of Wycliffe, Tyndale, Coverdale, the Bishops' Bible, and the Douai Version, which is the authorised English translation of the Vulgate used by the Roman Catholics; in a word, upon doubtful points in style, all English versions have been drawn upon. The renditions of parts of the Hebrew Scriptures by Lowth and others in the eighteenth century and by Cheyne and Driver in our own days were likewise consulted.
<br>As to the text and order of the biblical books, the present translation follows Jewish tradition, the Sacred Scriptures having come down in a definite compass and in a definite text. They are separated into three divisions: Law (Torah, Pentateuch), Prophets (Nebi'im), Writings (Ketubim). Each of these possesses a different degree of holiness or authority. In the Prophets and the Writings the order of the books varies in manuscripts or among Jewish authorities; but there is absolute agreement as to the compass of these two divisions, and no book is
<br> 
<br>transposed from the one into the other. Thus Ruth, Lamentations, and Daniel are all placed in the division of Writings--not among the Prophets, as in non-Jewish versions.
<br>With every step by which each of the three parts was sealed, nothing to be added or to be taken away, the text was likewise fixed and thenceforth made the object of zealous watchfulness. Even with regard to the latest book of our Scriptures, we read its text substantially in the form in which the great Rabbi Akiba read it, he who said that the system by which the sacred text was guarded constituted a fence about the Scriptures. In that system, at first oral and later committed to writing, the letters were actually counted and lists made, to the end that no alterations should creep in at the hands of careless scribes. The first to collect the notes known as Masorah was Jacob ben Haim Ibn Adonijah, the editor of the second Rabbinic Bible. In our own day many scholars have been prominent in this field of labour, chief among whom are Wolf Heidenheim, S. Frensdorff, S. Baer, and C. D. Ginsburg. We have followed Baer's texta and for the parts not edited by him that of Ginsburg. Not only does the text known as the masoretic represent the text current in the Synagogue with regard to consonants, but also with regard to its signs standing for vowels and accents, both of which embody the interpretation accepted by the Synagogue. While in the scrolls which are read in the Synagogue the bare consonants are alone permitted, readers must prepare themselves from copies allowed for private use, in ancient times written and now printed, which contain the additional signs for vowels and accents. A translation must naturally follow the guide of the latter. Moreover, the public reader is bound in certain cases to substitute mentally other consonants in the place of those found in the scrolls, in accordance with the marginal annotations in the copies intended for private use. These variants are taken traditionally for corrections, and the public reader who persists in ignoring them forfeits his position. It is true that in the case of such variations the Jewish commentators of the Middle Ages sought to elicit a meaning also from the textual reading, and seem here and there tacitly to give it preference, but all this partakes of the nature of private judgment, and does not affect the uniform practice of the public readings in the Synagogue. While as a rule the margin (Kere) was followed, we have occasionally adopted the consonants of the text (Ketib), as for instance in Ps 139:16, and 2Ch 24:27 34:9.
<br>
<br>a It should be noted that in the otherwise excellent edition of Baer the word חק has been omitted by mistake in Pr 5:20. In Eze 9:9 the Board deviated from the Baer edition and accepted the reading דמים instead of חמס. In Ps 62:4 the. vocalization of Ben Naphtali was followed instead of that of Ben Asher usually adopted by Baer.
<br> 
<br>A translation destined for the people can follow only one text, and that must be the traditional. Nevertheless a translator is not a transcriber of the text. His principal function is to make the Hebrew intelligible. Faithful though he must be to the Hebrew idiom, he will nevertheless be forced by the genius of the English language to use circumlocution, to add a word or two, to alter the sequence of words, and the like. In general, our rule has been that, where the word or words added are implied in the Hebrew construction, no device is used to mark the addition; where, on the other hand, the addition is not at once to be inferred from the original wording and yet seems necessary for the understanding, it has been enclosed in brackets. Naturally opinion will differ as to what may be deemed an addition warranted by the Hebrew construction and what may not, but as intelligibility was the principal aim, the Editors have felt justified in making their additions, sparingly it is true, but nevertheless as often as the occasion required.
<br>We have thought it proper to limit the margin to the shortest compass, confining it to such elucidation of and references to the literal meaning as are absolutely necessary for making the translation intelligible. The Rabbis enumerate eighteen instances in which the scribes consciously altered the text. We have called attention to a change of this nature in Jud 18:30.
<br>Personal pronouns referring to the Deity have been capitalized. As an aid to clearness direct discourse has been indicated by quotation marks. In the prophetical writings, where the speech of the prophet imperceptibly glides into the words of the Deity, and in the legal portions of the Pentateuch, it has been thought best to use quotation marks sparingly. Although the spelling of proper names in the English Bible in many instances deviates somewhat from an accurate representation of the Hebrew, it has nevertheless been deemed wise, owing to the familiarity of Hebrew names in their usual English form, generally to retain the current spelling.
<br>In all externals this translation is especially adapted for use in synagogue and school. The Keriat ha-Torah, or the reading of the section from the Five Books of Moses, is the central feature of the Synagogue service. The Pentateuch is divided into fifty-four sections; beginning with the Sabbath following the Feast of Tabernacles, the readings on the Sabbaths of the year are taken in their order from the Five Books of Moses. The reading consists either of the whole section or of a selected portion. There was a variant custom according to which the reading of the Torah extended over a period of three years instead of one year. However, the one year cycle gradually superseded the three year cycle, and has become the universal custom in the Synagogue.
<br>The Pentateuchal readings are supplemented by readings from the Prophets
<br> 
<br>known as Haftarot. Readings from the third portion of the Bible, though customary at one time, have now largely fallen into disuse. The five small books known as the Five Megillot are given a place in the Synagogue service in their entirety. On the feast of Purim the book of Esther is read; the book of Lamentations is read on Tish'ah be-Ab (Ninth of Ab), the fast-day observed in commemoration of the destruction of Jerusalem; Song of Songs, Ruth, and Ecclesiastes are read respectively on the Feast of Passover, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Tabernacles.
<br>The sections of the Pentateuch as traditionally read on the Sabbath are indicated, and a table gives all Scriptural readings, both on the Sabbath and on feast days and fast days.
<br>By the favor of a gracious Providence the present company of Editors was permitted to finish the work which is now given to the public. The final meeting in November, nineteen hundred and fifteen, was closed with a prayer of thanks to God that the great task was completed and that the group which during seven years had toiled together was intact. Since that day two of our number have been called to the academy on high, Solomon Schechter and Joseph Jacobs, be their memory for a blessing. We grieve that it was not granted these cherished colleagues to live to see the final fruition of their labours; their wholehearted and devoted service is herewith recorded in grateful appreciation. In all humility their co-workers submit this version to the Jewish people in the confident hope that it will aid them in the knowledge of the Word of God.

<br>GENESIS
<br> 
<br>In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. 2Now the earth was unformed and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the  spirit of God hovered over the face of the waters. 3And God said: ‘Let there be light.’ And there was light. 4And God saw the light, that it was good; and God divided the light from the darkness. 5And God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. And there was evening
<br>and there was morning, one day.
<br>6And God said: ‘Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.’ 7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament; and it was so. 8And God called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.
<br>9And God said: ‘Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear.’ And it was so. 10And God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the waters called He Seas; and God saw that it was good. 11And God said: ‘Let the earth put forth grass, herb yielding seed, and fruit-tree bearing fruit after its kind, wherein is the seed thereof, upon the
<br> 
<br>earth.’ And it was so. 12And the earth brought forth grass, herb yielding seed after its kind, and tree bearing fruit, wherein is the seed thereof, after its kind; and God saw that it was good. 13And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.
<br>14And God said: ‘Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years; 15and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth.’ And it was so. 16And God made the two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night; and the stars. 17And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, 18and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness; and God saw that it was good. 19And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.
<br>20And God said: ‘Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let fowl fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.’ 21And God created the great sea-monsters, and every living creature that creepeth, wherewith the waters swarmed, after its kind, and every winged fowl after its kind; and God saw that it was good. 22And God
<br> 
<br>blessed them, saying: ‘Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.’ 23And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.
<br>24And God said: ‘Let the earth bring forth the living creature after its kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after its kind.’ And it was so. 25And God made the beast of the earth after its kind, and the cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the ground after its kind; and God saw that it was good. 26And God said: ‘Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.’ 27And God created man in His own image, in the image of God created He him; male and female created He them. 28And God blessed them; and God said unto them: ‘Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that creepeth upon the earth.’ 29And God said: ‘Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed—to you it shall be for food; 30and to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is a
<br> 
<br>living soul, [I have given] every green herb for food.’ And it was so. 31And God saw every thing that He had made, and, behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.
<br>And the heaven and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. 2And on the seventh day God finished His work which He had made; and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had made. 3And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it; because that in it He rested from all His work which God in
<br>creating had made.
<br>4These are the generations of the heaven and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made earth and heaven.
<br>5No shrub of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground; 6but there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground. 7Then the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. 8And the LORD God planted a garden eastward, in Eden; and there He put the man whom He had formed. 9And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good
<br> 
<br>and evil. 10And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became four heads. 11The name of the first is Pishon; that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold; 12and the gold of that land is good; there is bdellium and the onyx stone. 13And the name of the second river is Gihon; the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Cush. 14And the name of the third river is aTigris; that is it which goeth toward the east of Asshur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates. 15And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. 16And the LORD God commanded the man, saying: ‘Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat; 17but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.’
<br>18And the LORD God said: ‘It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a help meet for him.’ 19And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto the man to see what he would call them; and whatsoever the man would call every living creature, that was to be the name thereof. 20And the man gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there
<br>
<br>a Heb. Hiddekel.
<br> 
<br>was not found a help meet for him. 21And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs, and closed up the place with flesh instead thereof. 22And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from the man, made He a woman, and brought her unto the man. 23And the man said: ‘This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called bWoman, because she was taken out of cMan.’ 24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh. 25And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.
<br>Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which
<br>the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman: ‘Yea, hath God said: Ye shall not eat of any tree of the garden?’ 2And the woman said unto the serpent: ‘Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat; 3but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said: Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.’ 4And the serpent said unto the woman: ‘Ye shall not surely die; 5for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil.’ 6And when the woman saw that the tree was good
<br>
<br>b Heb. Issahah.
<br>c Heb. Ish.
<br> 
<br>for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat; and she gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat. 7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig- leaves together, and made themselves girdles. 8And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden toward the cool of the day; and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden. 9And the LORD God called unto the man, and said unto him: ‘Where art thou?’ 10And he said: ‘I heard Thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.’ 11And He said: ‘Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?’ 12And the man said: ‘The woman whom Thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.’ 13And the LORD God said unto the woman: ‘What is this thou hast done?’ And the woman said: ‘The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.’ 14And the LORD God said unto the serpent: ‘Because thou hast done this, cursed art thou from among all cattle, and from among all beasts of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life. 15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed
<br> 
<br>and her seed; they shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise their heel.’
<br>16Unto the woman He said: ‘I will greatly multiply thy pain and thy travail; in pain thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.’
<br>17And unto Adam He said: ‘Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying: Thou shalt not eat of it; cursed is the ground for thy sake; in toil shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life. 18Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field. 19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken; for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.’ 20And the man called his wife’s name aEve; because she was the mother of all living. 21And the LORD God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins, and clothed them.
<br>22And the LORD God said: ‘Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever.’ 23Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken. 24So He drove out the man; and He placed at the east of the garden of Eden the cherubim, and the flaming
<br>
<br>a Heb. Havvah, that is, Life.
<br> 
<br>sword which turned every way, to keep the way to the tree of life.
<br>And the man knew Eve his wife; and she conceived and bore Cain,
<br>and said: ‘I have agotten a man with the help of the LORD.’ 2And again she bore his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. 3And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD. 4And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering; 5but unto Cain and to his offering He had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell. 6And the LORD said unto Cain: ‘Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? 7If thou doest well, shall it not be lifted up? and if thou doest not well, sin coucheth at the door; and unto thee is its desire, but thou mayest rule over it.’ 8And Cain spoke unto Abel his brother. And it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.
<br>9And the LORD said unto Cain: ‘Where is Abel thy brother?’ And he said: ‘I know not; am I my brother’s keeper?’ 10And He said: ‘What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto Me from the ground. 11And now cursed art thou from the ground, which hath opened her mouth
<br>
<br>a Heb. Kanah, to get.
<br> 
<br>to receive thy brother’s blood from thy hand. 12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be in the earth.’ 13And Cain said unto the LORD: ‘My punishment is greater than I can bear. 14Behold, Thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the land; and from Thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth; and it will come to pass, that whosoever findeth me will slay me.’ 15And the LORD said unto him: ‘Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold.’ And the LORD set a sign for Cain, lest any finding him should smite him.
<br>16And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of bNod, on the east of Eden. 17And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bore Enoch; and he builded a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch. 18And unto Enoch was born Irad; and Irad begot cMehujael; and Mehujael begot Methushael; and Methushael begot Lamech. 19And Lamech took unto him two wives; the name of one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah. 20And Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of such as dwell in tents and have cattle. 21And his brother’s name was Jubal; he was the father of all such as handle the
<br>
<br>b That is, Wandering.
<br>c Heb. Mehijael.
<br> 
<br>harp and pipe. 22And Zillah, she also bore Tubal-cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron; and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah. 23And Lamech said unto his wives:
<br>Adah and Zillah, hear my voice;
<br>Ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech;
<br>For I have slain a man for wounding me,
<br>And a young man for bruising me;
<br>24If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold,
<br>Truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.
<br>25And Adam knew his wife again; and she bore a son, and called his name aSeth: ‘for God bhath appointed me another seed instead of Abel; for Cain slew him.’ 26And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enosh; then began men to call upon the name of the LORD. This	is	the	book	of	the generations of Adam. In the day
<br>that God created man, in the likeness of God made He him; 2male and female created He them, and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created. 3And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begot a son in his own likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth. 4And the days of Adam after he begot Seth were eight hundred years;
<br>
<br>a Heb. Sheth.
<br>b Heb. Shath.
<br> 
<br>and he begot sons and daughters. 5And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years; and he died.
<br>6And Seth lived a hundred and five years, and begot Enosh. 7And Seth lived after he begot Enosh eight hundred and seven years, and begot sons and daughters. 8And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years; and he died.
<br>9And Enosh lived ninety years, and begot Kenan. 10And Enosh lived after he begot Kenan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begot sons and daughters. 11And all the days of Enosh were nine hundred and five years; and he died.
<br>12And Kenan lived seventy years, and begot Mahalalel. 13And Kenan lived after he begot Mahalalel eight hundred and forty years, and begot sons and daughters. 14And all the days of Kenan were nine hundred and ten years; and he died.
<br>15And Mahalalel lived sixty and five years, and begot Jared. 16And Mahalalel lived after he begot Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begot sons and daughters. 17And all the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred ninety and five years; and he died.
<br>18And Jared lived a hundred sixty and two years, and begot Enoch. 19And Jared lived after he begot Enoch eight hundred years, and begot sons and daughters. 20And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years; and he died.
<br> 
<br>21And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begot Methuselah. 22And Enoch walked with God after he begot Methuselah three hundred years, and begot sons and daughters. 23And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years. 24And Enoch walked with God, and he was not; for God took him.
<br>25And Methuselah lived a hundred eighty and seven years, and begot Lamech. 26And Methuselah lived after he begot Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begot sons and daughters. 27And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years; and he died.
<br>28And Lamech lived a hundred eighty and two years, and begot a son. 29And he called his name Noah, saying: ‘This same shall acomfort us in our work and in the toil of our hands, which cometh from the ground which the LORD hath cursed.’ 30And Lamech lived after he begot Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begot sons and daughters. 31And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years; and he died.
<br>32And Noah was five hundred years old; and Noah begot Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
<br>And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of
<br>the earth, and daughters were born unto them, 2that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were
<br>
<br>a Heb. nahem, to comfort.
<br> 
<br>fair; and they took them wives, whomsoever they chose. 3And the LORD said: ‘My spirit shall not abide in man for ever, for that he also is flesh; therefore shall his days be a hundred and twenty years.’ 4The Nephilim were in the earth in those days, and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bore children to them; the same were the mighty men that were of old, the men of renown.
<br>5And the LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. 6And it repented the LORD that He had made man on the earth, and it grieved Him at His heart. 7And the LORD said: ‘I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and creeping thing, and fowl of the air; for it repenteth Me that I have made them.’ 8But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.
<br>נח
<br>9These are the generations of Noah. Noah was in his generations a man righteous and wholehearted; Noah walked with God. 10And Noah begot three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. 11And the earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence. 12And God saw the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth.
<br> 
<br>13And God said unto Noah: ‘The end of all flesh is come before Me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth. 14Make thee an ark of gopher wood; with rooms shalt thou make the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch. 15And this is how thou shalt make it: the length of the ark three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits. 16A light shalt thou make to the ark, and to a cubit shalt thou finish it upward; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it. 17And I, behold, I do bring the flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; every thing that is in the earth shall perish. 18But I will establish My covenant with thee; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons’wives with thee. 19And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female. 20Of the fowl after their kind, and of the cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive. 21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.’ 22Thus did Noah; according
<br> 
<br>to all that God commanded him, so did he.
<br>And the LORD said unto Noah: ‘Come thou and all thy house into
<br>the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before Me in this generation. 2Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee seven and seven, each with his mate; and of the beasts that are not clean two [and two], each with his mate; 3of the fowl also of the air, seven and seven, male and female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth. 4For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I blot out from off the face of the earth.’ 5And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.
<br>6And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth. 7And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood. 8Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the ground, 9there went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, male and female, as God commanded Noah. 10And it came to pass after the seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth. 11In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were
<br> 
<br>opened. 12And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
<br>13In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah’s wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark; 14they, and every beast after its kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after its kind, and every fowl after its kind, every bird of every sort. 15And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh wherein is the breath of life. 16And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God commanded him; and the LORD shut him in. 17And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bore up the ark, and it was lifted up above the earth. 18And the waters prevailed, and increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters. 19And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high mountains that were under the whole heaven were covered. 20Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered. 21And all flesh perished that moved upon the earth, both fowl, and cattle, and beast, and every swarming thing that swarmeth upon the earth, and every man; 22all in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, whatsoever was in the dry land, died. 23And He blotted out every living substance which was upon the face of
<br> 
<br>the ground, both man, and cattle, and creeping thing, and fowl of the heaven; and they were blotted out from the earth; and Noah only was left, and they that were with him in the ark. 24And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days.
<br>And God remembered Noah, and every living thing,   and   all   the cattle that were with him in the ark; and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters assuaged; 2the fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained. 3And the waters returned from off the earth continually; and after the end of a hundred and fifty days the waters decreased. 4And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat. 5And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains
<br>seen.
<br>6And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made. 7And he sent forth a raven, and it went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth. 8And he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground. 9But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him to the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth; and he put forth his hand,
<br> 
<br>and took her, and brought her in unto him into the ark. 10And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark. 11And the dove came in to him at eventide; and lo in her mouth an olive-leaf freshly plucked; so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth. 12And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; and she returned not again unto him any more.
<br>13And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth; and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and behold, the face of the ground was dried. 14And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dry.
<br>15And God spoke unto Noah, saying: 16’Go forth from the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons’wives with thee. 17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee of all flesh, both fowl, and cattle, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may swarm in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.’ 18And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’wives with him; 19every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, whatsoever moveth upon the earth, after their families; went forth out of the ark.
<br>20And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean
<br> 
<br>beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt-offerings on the altar. 21And the LORD smelled the sweet savour; and the LORD said in His heart: ‘I will not again curse the ground any more for man’s sake; for the imagination of man’s heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done. 22While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.’
<br>And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them: ‘Be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth. 2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, and upon all wherewith the ground teemeth, and upon all the fishes of the sea: into your hand are they delivered. 3Every moving thing that liveth shall be for food for you; as the green herb have I given you all. 4Only flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat. 5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it; and at the hand of man, even at the hand of every man’s brother, will I require the life of man. 6Whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed; for in the image of God made He man. 7And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; swarm in the earth, and multiply
<br>therein.’
<br> 
<br>8And God spoke unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying: 9’As for Me, behold, I establish My covenant with you, and with your seed after you; 10and with every living creature that is with you, the fowl, the cattle, and every beast of the earth with you; of all that go out of the ark, even every beast of the earth. 11And I will establish My covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of the flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.’ 12And God said: ‘This is the token of the covenant which I make between Me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations: 13I have set My bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between Me and the earth. 14And it shall come to pass, when I bring clouds over the earth, and the bow is seen in the cloud, 15that I will remember My covenant, which is between Me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. 16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.’ 17And God said unto Noah: ‘This is the token of the covenant which I have established between Me and all flesh that is upon the earth.’
<br>18And the sons of Noah, that went forth from the ark, were Shem, and
<br> 
<br>Ham, and Japheth; and Ham is the father of Canaan. 19These three were the sons of Noah, and of these was the whole earth overspread.
<br>20And Noah the husbandman began, and planted a vineyard. 21And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent. 22And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without. 23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father’s nakedness. 24And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his youngest son had done unto him. 25And he said:
<br>Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.
<br>26And he said:
<br>Blessed be the LORD, the God of Shem;
<br>And let Canaan be their servant.
<br>27God aenlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem;
<br>And let Canaan be their servant.
<br>28And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years. 29And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years; and he died.
<br>
<br>Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah: Shem,
<br>
<br> 
<br>a Heb. Japhth.
<br> 
<br>Ham, and Japheth; and unto them were sons born after the flood. 2The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras. 3And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah. 4And the sons of Javan: Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. 5Of these were the isles of the nations divided in their lands, every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.
<br>6And the sons of Ham: Cush, and Mizraim, and Put, and Canaan. 7And the sons of Cush: Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabteca; and the sons of Raamah: Sheba, and Dedan. 8And Cush begot Nimrod; he began to be a mighty one in the earth. 9He was a mighty hunter before the LORD; wherefore it is said: ‘Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before the LORD.’ 10And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. 11Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and Rehoboth-ir, and Calah, 12and Resen between Nineveh and Calah—the same is the great city. 13And Mizraim begot Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim, 14and Pathrusim, and Casluhim—whence went forth the Philistines—and Caphtorim.
<br>15And Canaan begot Zidon his firstborn, and Heth; 16and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgashite; 17and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and
<br> 
<br>the Sinite; 18and the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite; and afterward were the families of the Canaanite spread abroad. 19And the border of the Canaanite was from Zidon, as thou goest toward Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest toward Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim, unto Lasha. 20These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, in their nations.
