<br>(a) Food and Drug Administration and U.S. Customs and Border Protection cooperation
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary of Health and Human Services (referred to in this section as the "Secretary"), acting through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs and in consultation with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, shall develop and periodically update a mutually agreed upon list of the controlled substances that the Secretary will refer to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, unless the Secretary and U.S. Customs and Border Protection agree otherwise, when such substances are offered for import via international mail and appear to violate the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.), the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 951 et seq.), the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.), or any other applicable law. The Secretary shall transfer controlled substances on such list to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. If the Secretary identifies additional packages that appear to be the same as such package containing a controlled substance, such additional packages may also be transferred to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection shall receive such packages consistent with the requirements of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.).

<br>Findings
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 111–31, div. A, §2, June 22, 2009, 123 Stat. 1776, provided that: "The Congress finds the following:
<br>
<br>"(1) The use of tobacco products by the Nation's children is a pediatric disease of considerable proportions that results in new generations of tobacco-dependent children and adults.
<br>
<br>"(2) A consensus exists within the scientific and medical communities that tobacco products are inherently dangerous and cause cancer, heart disease, and other serious adverse health effects.
<br>
<br>"(3) Nicotine is an addictive drug.
<br>
<br>"(4) Virtually all new users of tobacco products are under the minimum legal age to purchase such products.
<br>
<br>"(5) Tobacco advertising and marketing contribute significantly to the use of nicotine-containing tobacco products by adolescents.
<br>
<br>"(6) Because past efforts to restrict advertising and marketing of tobacco products have failed adequately to curb tobacco use by adolescents, comprehensive restrictions on the sale, promotion, and distribution of such products are needed.
<br>
<br>"(7) Federal and State governments have lacked the legal and regulatory authority and resources they need to address comprehensively the public health and societal problems caused by the use of tobacco products.
<br>
<br>"(8) Federal and State public health officials, the public health community, and the public at large recognize that the tobacco industry should be subject to ongoing oversight.
<br>
<br>"(9) Under article I, section 8 of the Constitution, the Congress is vested with the responsibility for regulating interstate commerce and commerce with Indian tribes.
<br>
<br>"(10) The sale, distribution, marketing, advertising, and use of tobacco products are activities in and substantially affecting interstate commerce because they are sold, marketed, advertised, and distributed in interstate commerce on a nationwide basis, and have a substantial effect on the Nation's economy.
<br>
<br>"(11) The sale, distribution, marketing, advertising, and use of such products substantially affect interstate commerce through the health care and other costs attributable to the use of tobacco products.
<br>
<br>"(12) It is in the public interest for Congress to enact legislation that provides the Food and Drug Administration with the authority to regulate tobacco products and the advertising and promotion of such products. The benefits to the American people from enacting such legislation would be significant in human and economic terms.
<br>
<br>"(13) Tobacco use is the foremost preventable cause of premature death in America. It causes over 400,000 deaths in the United States each year, and approximately 8,600,000 Americans have chronic illnesses related to smoking.
<br>
<br>"(14) Reducing the use of tobacco by minors by 50 percent would prevent well over 10,000,000 of today's children from becoming regular, daily smokers, saving over 3,000,000 of them from premature death due to tobacco-induced disease. Such a reduction in youth smoking would also result in approximately $75,000,000,000 in savings attributable to reduced health care costs.
<br>
<br>"(15) Advertising, marketing, and promotion of tobacco products have been especially directed to attract young persons to use tobacco products, and these efforts have resulted in increased use of such products by youth. Past efforts to oversee these activities have not been successful in adequately preventing such increased use.
<br>
<br>"(16) In 2005, the cigarette manufacturers spent more than $13,000,000,000 to attract new users, retain current users, increase current consumption, and generate favorable long-term attitudes toward smoking and tobacco use.
<br>
<br>"(17) Tobacco product advertising often misleadingly portrays the use of tobacco as socially acceptable and healthful to minors.
<br>
<br>"(18) Tobacco product advertising is regularly seen by persons under the age of 18, and persons under the age of 18 are regularly exposed to tobacco product promotional efforts.
<br>
<br>"(19) Through advertisements during and sponsorship of sporting events, tobacco has become strongly associated with sports and has become portrayed as an integral part of sports and the healthy lifestyle associated with rigorous sporting activity.
<br>
<br>"(20) Children are exposed to substantial and unavoidable tobacco advertising that leads to favorable beliefs about tobacco use, plays a role in leading young people to overestimate the prevalence of tobacco use, and increases the number of young people who begin to use tobacco.
<br>
<br>"(21) The use of tobacco products in motion pictures and other mass media glamorizes its use for young people and encourages them to use tobacco products.
<br>
<br>"(22) Tobacco advertising expands the size of the tobacco market by increasing consumption of tobacco products including tobacco use by young people.
<br>
<br>"(23) Children are more influenced by tobacco marketing than adults: more than 80 percent of youth smoke three heavily marketed brands, while only 54 percent of adults, 26 and older, smoke these same brands.
<br>
<br>"(24) Tobacco company documents indicate that young people are an important and often crucial segment of the tobacco market. Children, who tend to be more price sensitive than adults, are influenced by advertising and promotion practices that result in drastically reduced cigarette prices.
<br>
<br>"(25) Comprehensive advertising restrictions will have a positive effect on the smoking rates of young people.
<br>
<br>"(26) Restrictions on advertising are necessary to prevent unrestricted tobacco advertising from undermining legislation prohibiting access to young people and providing for education about tobacco use.
<br>
<br>"(27) International experience shows that advertising regulations that are stringent and comprehensive have a greater impact on overall tobacco use and young people's use than weaker or less comprehensive ones.
<br>
<br>"(28) Text only requirements, although not as stringent as a ban, will help reduce underage use of tobacco products while preserving the informational function of advertising.
<br>
<br>"(29) It is in the public interest for Congress to adopt legislation to address the public health crisis created by actions of the tobacco industry.
<br>
<br>"(30) The final regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services in the August 28, 1996, issue of the Federal Register (61 Fed. Reg. 44615–44618) for inclusion as part 897 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, are consistent with the first amendment to the United States Constitution and with the standards set forth in the amendments made by this subtitle [probably means this division, see Short Title of 2009 Amendment note set out under section 301 of this title] for the regulation of tobacco products by the Food and Drug Administration, and the restriction on the sale and distribution of, including access to and the advertising and promotion of, tobacco products contained in such regulations are substantially related to accomplishing the public health goals of this division.
<br>
<br>"(31) The regulations described in paragraph (30) will directly and materially advance the Federal Government's substantial interest in reducing the number of children and adolescents who use cigarettes and smokeless tobacco and in preventing the life-threatening health consequences associated with tobacco use. An overwhelming majority of Americans who use tobacco products begin using such products while they are minors and become addicted to the nicotine in those products before reaching the age of 18. Tobacco advertising and promotion play a crucial role in the decision of these minors to begin using tobacco products. Less restrictive and less comprehensive approaches have not [been] and will not be effective in reducing the problems addressed by such regulations. The reasonable restrictions on the advertising and promotion of tobacco products contained in such regulations will lead to a significant decrease in the number of minors using and becoming addicted to those products.
<br>
<br>"(32) The regulations described in paragraph (30) impose no more extensive restrictions on communication by tobacco manufacturers and sellers than are necessary to reduce the number of children and adolescents who use cigarettes and smokeless tobacco and to prevent the life-threatening health consequences associated with tobacco use. Such regulations are narrowly tailored to restrict those advertising and promotional practices which are most likely to be seen or heard by youth and most likely to entice them into tobacco use, while affording tobacco manufacturers and sellers ample opportunity to convey information about their products to adult consumers.
<br>
<br>"(33) Tobacco dependence is a chronic disease, one that typically requires repeated interventions to achieve long-term or permanent abstinence.
<br>
<br>"(34) Because the only known safe alternative to smoking is cessation, interventions should target all smokers to help them quit completely.
<br>
<br>"(35) Tobacco products have been used to facilitate and finance criminal activities both domestically and internationally. Illicit trade of tobacco products has been linked to organized crime and terrorist groups.
<br>
<br>"(36) It is essential that the Food and Drug Administration review products sold or distributed for use to reduce risks or exposures associated with tobacco products and that it be empowered to review any advertising and labeling for such products. It is also essential that manufacturers, prior to marketing such products, be required to demonstrate that such products will meet a series of rigorous criteria, and will benefit the health of the population as a whole, taking into account both users of tobacco products and persons who do not currently use tobacco products.
<br>
<br>"(37) Unless tobacco products that purport to reduce the risks to the public of tobacco use actually reduce such risks, those products can cause substantial harm to the public health to the extent that the individuals, who would otherwise not consume tobacco products or would consume such products less, use tobacco products purporting to reduce risk. Those who use products sold or distributed as modified risk products that do not in fact reduce risk, rather than quitting or reducing their use of tobacco products, have a substantially increased likelihood of suffering disability and premature death. The costs to society of the widespread use of products sold or distributed as modified risk products that do not in fact reduce risk or that increase risk include thousands of unnecessary deaths and injuries and huge costs to our health care system.
<br>
<br>"(38) As the National Cancer Institute has found, many smokers mistakenly believe that 'low tar' and 'light' cigarettes cause fewer health problems than other cigarettes. As the National Cancer Institute has also found, mistaken beliefs about the health consequences of smoking 'low tar' and 'light' cigarettes can reduce the motivation to quit smoking entirely and thereby lead to disease and death.
<br>
<br>"(39) Recent studies have demonstrated that there has been no reduction in risk on a population-wide basis from 'low tar' and 'light' cigarettes, and such products may actually increase the risk of tobacco use.
<br>
<br>"(40) The dangers of products sold or distributed as modified risk tobacco products that do not in fact reduce risk are so high that there is a compelling governmental interest in ensuring that statements about modified risk tobacco products are complete, accurate, and relate to the overall disease risk of the product.
<br>
<br>"(41) As the Federal Trade Commission has found, consumers have misinterpreted advertisements in which one product is claimed to be less harmful than a comparable product, even in the presence of disclosures and advisories intended to provide clarification.
<br>
<br>"(42) Permitting manufacturers to make unsubstantiated statements concerning modified risk tobacco products, whether express or implied, even if accompanied by disclaimers would be detrimental to the public health.
<br>
<br>"(43) The only way to effectively protect the public health from the dangers of unsubstantiated modified risk tobacco products is to empower the Food and Drug Administration to require that products that tobacco manufacturers sold or distributed for risk reduction be reviewed in advance of marketing, and to require that the evidence relied on to support claims be fully verified.
<br>
<br>"(44) The Food and Drug Administration is a regulatory agency with the scientific expertise to identify harmful substances in products to which consumers are exposed, to design standards to limit exposure to those substances, to evaluate scientific studies supporting claims about the safety of products, and to evaluate the impact of labels, labeling, and advertising on consumer behavior in order to reduce the risk of harm and promote understanding of the impact of the product on health. In connection with its mandate to promote health and reduce the risk of harm, the Food and Drug Administration routinely makes decisions about whether and how products may be marketed in the United States.
<br>
<br>"(45) The Federal Trade Commission was created to protect consumers from unfair or deceptive acts or practices, and to regulate unfair methods of competition. Its focus is on those marketplace practices that deceive or mislead consumers, and those that give some competitors an unfair advantage. Its mission is to regulate activities in the marketplace. Neither the Federal Trade Commission nor any other Federal agency except the Food and Drug Administration possesses the scientific expertise needed to implement effectively all provisions of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act [div. A of Pub. L. 111–31, see Short Title of 2009 Amendment note set out under section 301 of this title].
<br>
<br>"(46) If manufacturers state or imply in communications directed to consumers through the media or through a label, labeling, or advertising, that a tobacco product is approved or inspected by the Food and Drug Administration or complies with Food and Drug Administration standards, consumers are likely to be confused and misled. Depending upon the particular language used and its context, such a statement could result in consumers being misled into believing that the product is endorsed by the Food and Drug Administration for use or in consumers being misled about the harmfulness of the product because of such regulation, inspection, approval, or compliance.
<br>
<br>"(47) In August 2006 a United States district court judge found that the major United States cigarette companies continue to target and market to youth. USA v. Philip Morris, USA, Inc., et al. (Civil Action No. 99–2496 (GK), August 17, 2006).
<br>
<br>"(48) In August 2006 a United States district court judge found that the major United States cigarette companies dramatically increased their advertising and promotional spending in ways that encourage youth to start smoking subsequent to the signing of the Master Settlement Agreement in 1998. USA v. Philip Morris, USA, Inc., et al. (Civil Action No. 99–2496 (GK), August 17, 2006).
<br>
<br>"(49) In August 2006 a United States district court judge found that the major United States cigarette companies have designed their cigarettes to precisely control nicotine delivery levels and provide doses of nicotine sufficient to create and sustain addiction while also concealing much of their nicotine-related research. USA v. Philip Morris, USA, Inc., et al. (Civil Action No. 99–2496 (GK), August 17, 2006)."

<br>
<br>(iii) contain such other information as the Secretary shall prescribe.
<br>(B) Referral to the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee

<br>
<br>An order of the Secretary approving a petition for a variance shall prescribe such conditions respecting the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, packing, and storage of the tobacco product to be granted the variance under the petition as may be necessary to assure that the tobacco product will be in compliance with this subchapter.

<br>§387g. Tobacco product standards
<br>(a) In general
<br>(1) Special rules
<br>(A) Special rule for cigarettes
<br>
<br>Beginning 3 months after June 22, 2009, a cigarette or any of its component parts (including the tobacco, filter, or paper) shall not contain, as a constituent (including a smoke constituent) or additive, an artificial or natural flavor (other than tobacco or menthol) or an herb or spice, including strawberry, grape, orange, clove, cinnamon, pineapple, vanilla, coconut, licorice, cocoa, chocolate, cherry, or coffee, that is a characterizing flavor of the tobacco product or tobacco smoke. Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to limit the Secretary's authority to take action under this section or other sections of this chapter applicable to menthol or any artificial or natural flavor, herb, or spice not specified in this subparagraph.
<br>(B) Additional special rule
<br>
<br>Beginning 2 years after June 22, 2009, a tobacco product manufacturer shall not use tobacco, including foreign grown tobacco, that contains a pesticide chemical residue that is at a level greater than is specified by any tolerance applicable under Federal law to domestically grown tobacco.
<br>(2) Revision of tobacco product standards
<br>
<br>The Secretary may revise the tobacco product standards in paragraph (1) in accordance with subsection (c).
<br>(3) Tobacco product standards
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary may adopt tobacco product standards in addition to those in paragraph (1) if the Secretary finds that a tobacco product standard is appropriate for the protection of the public health.
<br>(B) Determinations
<br>(i) Considerations
<br>
<br>In making a finding described in subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall consider scientific evidence concerning—
<br>
<br>(I) the risks and benefits to the population as a whole, including users and nonusers of tobacco products, of the proposed standard;
<br>
<br>(II) the increased or decreased likelihood that existing users of tobacco products will stop using such products; and
<br>
<br>(III) the increased or decreased likelihood that those who do not use tobacco products will start using such products.
<br>(ii) Additional considerations
<br>
<br>In the event that the Secretary makes a determination, set forth in a proposed tobacco product standard in a proposed rule, that it is appropriate for the protection of public health to require the reduction or elimination of an additive, constituent (including a smoke constituent), or other component of a tobacco product because the Secretary has found that the additive, constituent, or other component is or may be harmful, any party objecting to the proposed standard on the ground that the proposed standard will not reduce or eliminate the risk of illness or injury may provide for the Secretary's consideration scientific evidence that demonstrates that the proposed standard will not reduce or eliminate the risk of illness or injury.
<br>(4) Content of tobacco product standards
<br>
<br>A tobacco product standard established under this section for a tobacco product—
<br>
<br>(A) shall include provisions that are appropriate for the protection of the public health, including provisions, where appropriate—
<br>
<br>(i) for nicotine yields of the product;
<br>
<br>(ii) for the reduction or elimination of other constituents, including smoke constituents, or harmful components of the product; or
<br>
<br>(iii) relating to any other requirement under subparagraph (B);
<br>
<br>(B) shall, where appropriate for the protection of the public health, include—
<br>
<br>(i) provisions respecting the construction, components, ingredients, additives, constituents, including smoke constituents, and properties of the tobacco product;
<br>
<br>(ii) provisions for the testing (on a sample basis or, if necessary, on an individual basis) of the tobacco product;
<br>
<br>(iii) provisions for the measurement of the tobacco product characteristics of the tobacco product;
<br>
<br>(iv) provisions requiring that the results of each or of certain of the tests of the tobacco product required to be made under clause (ii) show that the tobacco product is in conformity with the portions of the standard for which the test or tests were required; and
<br>
<br>(v) a provision requiring that the sale and distribution of the tobacco product be restricted but only to the extent that the sale and distribution of a tobacco product may be restricted under a regulation under section 387f(d) of this title;
<br>
<br>(C) shall, where appropriate, require the use and prescribe the form and content of labeling for the proper use of the tobacco product; and
<br>
<br>(D) shall require tobacco products containing foreign-grown tobacco to meet the same standards applicable to tobacco products containing domestically grown tobacco.
<br>(5) Periodic reevaluation of tobacco product standards
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall provide for periodic evaluation of tobacco product standards established under this section to determine whether such standards should be changed to reflect new medical, scientific, or other technological data. The Secretary may provide for testing under paragraph (4)(B) by any person.
<br>(6) Involvement of other agencies; informed persons
<br>
<br>In carrying out duties under this section, the Secretary shall endeavor to—
<br>
<br>(A) use personnel, facilities, and other technical support available in other Federal agencies;
<br>
<br>(B) consult with other Federal agencies concerned with standard setting and other nationally or internationally recognized standard-setting entities; and
<br>
<br>(C) invite appropriate participation, through joint or other conferences, workshops, or other means, by informed persons representative of scientific, professional, industry, agricultural, or consumer organizations who in the Secretary's judgment can make a significant contribution.
<br>(b) Considerations by Secretary
<br>(1) Technical achievability
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall consider information submitted in connection with a proposed standard regarding the technical achievability of compliance with such standard.
<br>(2) Other considerations
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall consider all other information submitted in connection with a proposed standard, including information concerning the countervailing effects of the tobacco product standard on the health of adolescent tobacco users, adult tobacco users, or nontobacco users, such as the creation of a significant demand for contraband or other tobacco products that do not meet the requirements of this subchapter and the significance of such demand.
<br>(c) Proposed standards
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking for the establishment, amendment, or revocation of any tobacco product standard.
<br>(2) Requirements of notice
<br>
<br>A notice of proposed rulemaking for the establishment or amendment of a tobacco product standard for a tobacco product shall—
<br>
<br>(A) set forth a finding with supporting justification that the tobacco product standard is appropriate for the protection of the public health;
<br>
<br>(B) invite interested persons to submit a draft or proposed tobacco product standard for consideration by the Secretary;
<br>
<br>(C) invite interested persons to submit comments on structuring the standard so that it does not advantage foreign-grown tobacco over domestically grown tobacco; and
<br>
<br>(D) invite the Secretary of Agriculture to provide any information or analysis which the Secretary of Agriculture believes is relevant to the proposed tobacco product standard.
<br>(3) Finding
<br>
<br>A notice of proposed rulemaking for the revocation of a tobacco product standard shall set forth a finding with supporting justification that the tobacco product standard is no longer appropriate for the protection of the public health.
<br>(4) Comment
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall provide for a comment period of not less than 60 days.
<br>(d) Promulgation
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>After the expiration of the period for comment on a notice of proposed rulemaking published under subsection (c) respecting a tobacco product standard and after consideration of comments submitted under subsections (b) and (c) and any report from the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee, the Secretary shall—
<br>
<br>(A) if the Secretary determines that the standard would be appropriate for the protection of the public health, promulgate a regulation establishing a tobacco product standard and publish in the Federal Register findings on the matters referred to in subsection (c); or
<br>
<br>(B) publish a notice terminating the proceeding for the development of the standard together with the reasons for such termination.
<br>(2) Effective date
