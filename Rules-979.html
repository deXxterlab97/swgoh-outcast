<br>
<br>(2) For the purpose of this subsection, the number of students who are deemed eligible in a State for participation in the grant program authorized by this subpart, and the number of such students in all the States, shall be determined for the most recent year for which satisfactory data are available.

<br>
<br>(6) provides for the payment of the non-Federal portion of such grants or of such work-study jobs from funds supplied by such State which represent an additional expenditure for such year by such State for grants or work-study jobs for students attending institutions of higher education over the amount expended by such State for such grants or work-study jobs, if any, during the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year in which such State initially received funds under this subpart;
<br>

<br>Upon his approval of any application for a payment under this subpart, the Secretary shall reserve from the applicable allotment (including any applicable reallotment) available therefor, the amount of such payment, which (subject to the limits of such allotment or reallotment) shall be equal to the Federal share of the cost of the students' incentive grants or work-study jobs covered by such application. The Secretary shall pay such reserved amount, in advance or by way of reimbursement, and in such installments as the Secretary may determine. The Secretary may amend the reservation of any amount under this section, either upon approval of an amendment of the application or upon revision of the estimated cost of the student grants or work-study jobs with respect to which such reservation was made.
