<br>
<br>(2)(A) In the case of an individual who is a bankruptcy judge to whom this section applies and who retires under this section or who is removed from office under subsection (d) upon the sole ground of mental or physical disability, any service of that individual as a United States magistrate judge to whom this section applies, and any service of that individual as a full-time judicial officer who performed the duties of a magistrate judge and a bankruptcy judge at the same time, shall be included for purposes of calculating years of service under subsection (a), (b), (c), or (d), as the case may be.
<br>

Any payment under this paragraph to a person bars recovery by any other person.
<br>
<br>(2) Paragraph (1) shall apply only to payments made by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts after the date of receipt by the Director of written notice of such decree, order, or agreement, and such additional information as the Director may prescribe.

<br>
<br>(2) Consent to Deductions; Discharge of Claims.—Each bankruptcy judge or magistrate judge who makes an election under subsection (f) shall be deemed to consent and agree to the deductions from salary which are made under paragraph (1). Payment of such salary less such deductions (and any deductions made under section 376 of this title) is a full and complete discharge and acquittance of all claims and demands for all services rendered by such bankruptcy judge or magistrate judge during the period covered by such payment, except the right to those benefits to which the bankruptcy judge or magistrate judge is entitled under this section (and section 376).
<br>
<br>(k) Deposits for Prior Service.—Each bankruptcy judge or magistrate judge who makes an election under subsection (f) may deposit, for service performed before such election for which contributions may be made under this section, an amount equal to 1 percent of the salary received for that service. Credit for any period covered by that service may not be allowed for purposes of an annuity under this section until a deposit under this subsection has been made for that period.
<br>
<br>(l) Individual Retirement Records.—The amounts deducted and withheld under subsection (j), and the amounts deposited under subsection (k), shall be credited to individual accounts in the name of each bankruptcy judge or magistrate judge from whom such amounts are received, for credit to the Judicial Officers' Retirement Fund.
<br>
<br>(m) Annuities Affected in Certain Cases.—
<br>
<br>(1) Practicing law after retirement.—
<br>
<br>(A) Forfeiture of annuity.—Subject to subparagraph (B), any bankruptcy judge or magistrate judge who retires under this section and who thereafter practices law shall forfeit all rights to an annuity under this section for all periods beginning on or after the first day on which he or she so practices law.
<br>
<br>(B) Forfeiture not to apply where individual elects to freeze amount of annuity.—(i) If a bankruptcy judge or magistrate judge makes an election to practice law after retirement under this section—
<br>
<br>(I) subparagraph (A) shall not apply to such bankruptcy judge or magistrate judge beginning on the date such election takes effect, and
<br>
<br>(II) the annuity payable under this section to such bankruptcy judge or magistrate judge, for periods beginning on or after the date such election takes effect, shall be equal to the annuity to which such bankruptcy judge or magistrate judge is entitled on the day before such effective date.
<br>
<br>(ii) An election under clause (i)—
<br>
<br>(I) may be made by a bankruptcy judge or magistrate judge eligible for retirement under this section, and
<br>
<br>(II) shall be filed with the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.
<br>
<br>Such an election, once it takes effect, shall be irrevocable.
<br>
<br>(iii) Any election under this subparagraph shall take effect on the first day of the first month following the month in which the election is made.
<br>
<br>(2) Recall not permitted.—Any bankruptcy judge or magistrate judge who retires under this section and who thereafter practices law shall not be eligible for recall under section 155(b), 375, or 636(h) of this title.
<br>
<br>(3) Accepting other employment.—Any bankruptcy judge or magistrate judge who retires under this section and thereafter accepts compensation for civil office or employment under the United States Government (other than for the performance of functions as a bankruptcy judge or magistrate judge under section 155(b), 375, or 636(h) of this title) shall forfeit all rights to an annuity under this section for the period for which such compensation is received. For purposes of this paragraph, the term "compensation" includes retired pay or salary received in retired status.
<br>
<br>(n) Lump-Sum Payments.—
<br>
<br>(1) Eligibility.—(A) Subject to paragraph (2), an individual who serves as a bankruptcy judge or magistrate judge and—
<br>
<br>(i) who leaves office and is not reappointed as a bankruptcy judge or magistrate judge for at least 31 consecutive days;
<br>
<br>(ii) who files an application with the Administrative Office of the United States Courts for payment of the lump-sum credit;
<br>
<br>(iii) is not serving as a bankruptcy judge or magistrate judge at the time of filing of the application; and
<br>
<br>(iv) will not become eligible to receive an annuity under this section within 31 days after filing the application;
<br>
<br>is entitled to be paid the lump-sum credit. Payment of the lump-sum credit voids all rights to an annuity under this section based on the service on which the lump-sum credit is based, until that individual resumes office as a bankruptcy judge or magistrate judge.
<br>
<br>(B) Lump-sum benefits authorized by subparagraphs (C), (D), and (E) of this paragraph shall be paid to the person or persons surviving the bankruptcy judge or magistrate judge and alive on the date title to the payment arises, in the order of precedence set forth in subsection (o) of section 376 of this title, and in accordance with the last two sentences of that subsection. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term "judicial official" as used in subsection (o) of section 376 shall be deemed to mean "bankruptcy judge or magistrate judge".
<br>
<br>(C) If a bankruptcy judge or magistrate judge dies before receiving an annuity under this section, the lump-sum credit shall be paid.
<br>
<br>(D) If all annuity rights under this section based on the service of a deceased bankruptcy judge or magistrate judge terminate before the total annuity paid equals the lump-sum credit, the difference shall be paid.
<br>
<br>(E) If a bankruptcy judge or magistrate judge who is receiving an annuity under this section dies, annuity accrued and unpaid shall be paid.
<br>
<br>(F) Annuity accrued and unpaid on the termination, except by death, of the annuity of a bankruptcy judge or magistrate judge shall be paid to that individual.
<br>
<br>(G) Subject to paragraph (2), a bankruptcy judge or magistrate judge who forfeits rights to an annuity under subsection (m)(3) before the total annuity paid equals the lump-sum credit, shall be entitled to be paid the difference if the bankruptcy judge or magistrate judge files an application with the Administrative Office of the United States Courts for payment of that difference. A payment under this subparagraph voids all rights to an annuity on which the payment is based.
<br>
<br>(2) Spouses and former spouses.—(A) Payment of the lump-sum credit under paragraph (1)(A) or a payment under paragraph (1)(G)—
<br>
<br>(i) may be made only if any current spouse and any former spouse of the bankruptcy judge or magistrate judge are notified of the bankruptcy judge's or magistrate judge's application; and
<br>
<br>(ii) shall be subject to the terms of a court decree of divorce, annulment, or legal separation or any court or court approved property settlement agreement incident to such decree, if—
<br>
<br>(I) the decree, order, or agreement expressly relates to any portion of the lump-sum credit or other payment involved; and
<br>
<br>(II) payment of the lump-sum credit or other payment would extinguish entitlement of the bankruptcy judge's or magistrate judge's spouse or former spouse to any portion of an annuity under subsection (i).
<br>
<br>(B) Notification of a spouse or former spouse under this paragraph shall be made in accordance with such requirements as the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts shall by regulation prescribe. The Director may provide under such regulations that subparagraph (A)(i) may be waived with respect to a spouse or former spouse if the bankruptcy judge or magistrate judge establishes to the satisfaction of the Director that the whereabouts of such spouse or former spouse cannot be determined.
<br>
<br>(C) The Director shall prescribe regulations under which this paragraph shall be applied in any case in which the Director receives two or more orders or decrees described in subparagraph (A).

<br>
<br>(2) Investment of fund.—The Secretary of the Treasury shall invest, in interest bearing securities of the United States, such currently available portions of the Judicial Officers' Retirement Fund as are not immediately required for payments from the Fund. The income derived from these investments constitutes a part of the Fund.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>1948 Act
<br>
<br>Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §334 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §227, 36 Stat. 1154; Mar. 4, 1911, ch. 285, §1, 36 Stat. 1419; July 1, 1922, ch. 267, §3, 42 Stat. 816; June 12, 1926, ch. 568, 44 Stat. 736; Jan. 29, 1929, ch. 113, 45 Stat. 1143; Mar. 2, 1929, ch. 488, §1, 45 Stat. 1475; July 3, 1930, ch. 863, §1, 46 Stat. 1016; Feb. 23, 1931, ch. 276, §30, 46 Stat. 1214; May 17, 1932, ch. 190, 47 Stat. 158; June 30, 1932, ch. 314, §501, 47 Stat. 415; May 10, 1934, ch. 277, §512, 48 Stat. 758; Ex. Ord. No. 6166, §§12, 14, June 10, 1933; June 7, 1934, ch. 426, 48 Stat. 926; May 27, 1936, ch. 463, §1, 49 Stat. 1380; June 20, 1936, ch. 630, §5, 49 Stat. 1549; June 25, 1936, ch. 804, 49 Stat. 1921).
<br>
<br>Requirements for printing, binding, and issuing Supreme Court decisions "within eight months after said decisions have been rendered by the Supreme Court" and provision for distribution "within said period" were omitted. The phrase "as soon as practicable after rendition" was made the time for publishing such decisions as more flexible and practicable.
<br>
<br>The words "the United States Court for China" were omitted inasmuch as that court is no longer functioning. The Secretary of State by an arrangement with China has relinquished the extraterritorial jurisdiction previously exercised by the United States in China. The 1944 Legislative and Judiciary Appropriation Act approved June 28, 1943, made no appropriation for the United States Court for China. Appropriations for other courts were made in title II of chapter 173 (57 Stat. 241). The last appropriation for the United States Court for China was in the act of July 2, 1942 (ch. 472, title IV, 56 Stat. 502).
<br>
<br>The words "to the Secretary of War for the use of the proper courts and officers of the Philippine Islands, seven copies" were omitted in view of the independence of the Philippines, effective July 4, 1946.
<br>
<br>The phrase "justice or judge of the United States" obviated repetition of names of courts. (See definitive section 451 of this title.)
<br>
<br>Last sentence, fourth paragraph, of section 334 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., requiring that books should remain the property of the United States and should be preserved and turned over to successors in office, was omitted as covered by section 414 of this title.
<br>
<br>A reference to the United States attorney for the District of Columbia was omitted as covered by "each United States attorney."
<br>
<br>Provision authorizing distribution of volumes under this section to each place where a court of appeals is held was added for purposes of uniformity. See similar provision in section 413 of this title.
<br>
<br>The revised section substitutes the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts in lieu of the Attorney General insofar as distribution of volumes to the judiciary is concerned. This change is consistent with the duties of the former under section 601 et seq. of this title.
<br>
<br>Provision of section 334 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., as to the custody, use and delivery to successors was omitted as obsolete on advice of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.
<br>
<br>The limitation of 10 copies to the library of the Supreme Court and 6 copies to the marshal of the Supreme Court for use of the justices, was omitted and the provision for distribution in such number "specified by the Chief Justice of the United States" was substituted therefor.
<br>
<br>Authority for making an appropriation to carry into effect the provisions of this section is contained in section 336 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Acts July 1, 1922, ch. 267, §5, 42 Stat. 818; May 29, 1926, ch. 425, §3, 44 Stat. 678 which is omitted, but not repealed, as unnecessary in this revision.
<br>
<br>Changes were made in phraseology and arrangement.
<br>1949 Act
<br>
<br>Subsection (a) of this section substitutes, in section 411(a) of title 28, U.S.C., "Secretary of the Army" and "Department of the Army" for "Secretary of War" and "War Department," in view of such redesignation by act of July 26, 1947 (ch. 343, title II, §205(a), 61 Stat. 501). It substitutes, in section 411(a), "Commissioner of Customs; Commandant of the Coast Guard" for "Chief of the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation," in view of the abolishment of the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation, and the transfer of its functions to, and the division thereof between, the Commissioner of Customs and the Commandant of the Coast Guard, by 1946 Reorganization Plan No. 3, §§101–104, effective July 16, 1946 (11 F.R. 7875, 60 Stat. 1097).
<br>
<br>It substitutes, in such section 411(a), "Director of the Bureau of Land Management" for "Commissioner of the General Land Office," in view of section 403 of such plan which abolished the General Land Office and created the Bureau of Land Management, headed by a Director. It inserts as new, in such section 411(a), references to the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Air Force, and Judge Advocate General of the Air Force, in view of the creation of the National Military Establishment, headed by the Secretary of Defense, and the establishment of the Department of the Air Force in 1947.
<br>
<br>Subsection (b) of this section redesignates, in section 411(b) of title 28, U.S.C., the Secretary of War as "Secretary of the Army," for the reasons stated above, and corrects a typographical error in the word "court-martial".

<br>Based on section 1131 of title 26, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Internal Revenue Code, title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§337, 530 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §229, 36 Stat. 1155; Mar. 2, 1929, ch. 488, §1, 45 Stat. 1475; May 10, 1934, ch. 277, §512, 48 Stat. 758; June 7, 1934, ch. 426, 48 Stat. 926; June 25, 1936, ch. 804, 49 Stat. 1921; Feb. 10, 1939, ch. 2, §1131, 53 Stat. 163; May 14, 1940, ch. 189, title IV, 54 Stat. 210; July 2, 1942, ch. 472, title IV, 56 Stat. 504; June 28, 1943, ch. 173, title II, §201, 57 Stat. 243; June 26, 1944, ch. 277, §203, 58 Stat. 358; May 21, 1945, ch. 129, title IV, 59 Stat. 200; July 5, 1946, ch. 541, title IV, 60 Stat. 480.)
<br>
<br>Section consolidates provisions of section 1131 of title 26, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to expenditures for "lawbooks" for the Tax Court of the United States, with sections 337 and 530 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to purchase and distribution of reporter and digest volumes.
<br>
<br>Other provisions of section 1131 of title 26, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in section 604 of this title.
<br>
<br>Provisions of section 530 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., limiting the price to be paid for volumes of the Federal Reporter and other similar reports were omitted after consultation with the Administrative Office of United States Courts as more properly covered by current appropriation acts. Similar provisions relating to the Federal Digest and the United States Code Annotated were omitted as covered in current appropriation acts. (See Act June 29, 1944, ch. 286, title II, §212, 58 Stat. 361, 387.)
<br>
<br>Provisions of said section 337 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that books are to remain United States property, so marked, and transmitted to successors in office of persons receiving them, were omitted as covered by section 414 of this title.
<br>
<br>Similar provisions in said section 530 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in section 414 of this title.
<br>
<br>Provision in section 337 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for distribution to the Court of Appeals and District Court for the District of Columbia was omitted as covered by the phrase "Each place where a circuit court of appeals or district court is regularly held."
<br>
<br>The revised section is extended to include the Customs Court as well as the Court of Claims and Court of Customs and Patent Appeals. All judges receive the Supreme Court reports and digests under section 411 of this title. Presumably the Congress did not intend to deny distribution of the Federal Reporter and digests to the Customs Court while providing for all other courts under said section 337.
<br>
<br>The revised section provides for distribution of volumes to the judiciary by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. (See reviser's note under section 411 of this title.)
<br>
<br>Similar publications are purchased by the Marshal of Supreme Court for the use of the Court. (See section 672(5) of this title.)
<br>
<br>The provisions of section 337 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., requiring annual estimates and disbursement of moneys for the volumes under this section were omitted. Such provisions are covered by appropriate sections of title 31, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Money and Finance.
<br>
<br>Provision of section 337 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., as to custody, use, and delivery to successors was omitted as obsolete on advice of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.
<br>
<br>Numerous changes were made in phraseology and superfluous language was omitted.
<br>Senate Revision Amendment
<br>
<br>As finally enacted, part of act July 9, 1947, ch. 211, title IV, 61 Stat. 306, which was classified to Title 28, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §530, became one of the sources of this section and was accordingly included in the schedule of repeals by Senate amendment. See 80th Congress Senate Report No. 1559.
<br>
<br>Although section 1131 of Title 26, U.S.C. (Internal Revenue Code) is one of the sources of this section, it was struck out of the schedule of repeals by Senate amendment and accordingly remains in Title 26. See 80th Congress Senate Report No. 1559.
<br>1949 Act
<br>
<br>Subsection (a) of this section eliminates from section 413 of title 28, U.S.C., the provision for furnishing books to the Tax Court, which procures books under section 1131 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C., 1946 ed., §1131).
<br>
<br>Subsection (b) of this section incorporates in section 413 of title 28, U.S.C., with changes in phraseology, the provisions of act of June 3, 1948 (ch. 400, title II, §204, 62 Stat. 321), which was not incorporated in title 18 when the revision was enacted. As amended, section 413 is expanded to give like authority with respect to procurement of books to the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, as well as to the Attorney General, to prevent an obvious inconsistency.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on section 90 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees, section 530 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and section 92 of title 44, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Public Printing and Documents (Aug. 7, 1882, ch. 433, §1, 22 Stat. 336; Jan. 12, 1895, ch. 23, §74, 28 Stat. 620; June 20, 1936, ch. 630, §§11, 12, 49 Stat. 1552, 1553; May 14, 1940, ch. 189, title IV, 54 Stat. 210; June 28, 1941, ch. 258, title IV, 55 Stat. 301; July 2, 1942, ch. 472, title IV, 56 Stat. 504; June 28, 1943, ch. 173, title II, §201, 57 Stat. 243; June 26, 1944, ch. 277, §203, 58 Stat. 358; May 21, 1945, ch. 129, title IV, 59 Stat. 200; July 5, 1946, ch. 541, title IV, 60 Stat. 480).
<br>
<br>Section consolidates section 90 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., providing that "statutes" shall be delivered to successors of United States attorneys and clerks and provisions of section 530 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., requiring that all lawbooks for judges and others shall be marked as property of the United States and shall be transmitted to their successors, with section 92 of title 44, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to transmittal of "Government publications."
<br>
<br>Words "All Government publications and lawbooks" and "furnished under this chapter" were used to cover "all statutes" and "The Federal Reporter and continuations thereto."
<br>
<br>Words "justices and judges of the United States" were substituted for "United States judges" in conformity with uniform use of the phrase to describe all members of the Federal judiciary. Similar provisions in sections 334 and 377 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were therefore omitted as covered by this revised section.
<br>
<br>Other provisions of said section 530 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted. (See reviser's note under section 413 of this title.)
<br>
<br>The words "permanent or bound" were inserted in the last sentence of the revised section to obviate the wasteful practice under existing law of marking temporary pamphlets.
<br>
<br>Changes were made in phraseology.
<br>Senate Revision Amendment
<br>
<br>As finally enacted, part of act July 9, 1947, ch. 211, title IV, 61 Stat. 306, which was classified to Title 28, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §530, became one of the sources of this section and was accordingly included in the schedule of repeals by Senate amendment.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§13 and 302 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §§9, 189, 36 Stat. 1088, 1143; Mar. 2, 1929, ch. 488, §1, 45 Stat. 1475).
<br>
<br>Sections 13 and 302 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., related only to district courts and the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, and this section has been written to cover all other courts of the United States.
<br>
<br>Other provisions of said section 302 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in sections 214, 456, and 604 of this title.
<br>
<br>The phrase "always open" means "never closed" and signifies the time when a court can exercise its functions. With respect to matters enumerated by statute or rule as to which the court is "always open," there is no time when the court is without power to act. (Ex parte Branch, 63 Ala. 383, 387.)
<br>
<br>Section 13 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., provided that "The district courts, as courts of admiralty and as courts of equity, shall be deemed always open * * *" for enumerated purposes, and that the judge "at chambers or in the clerk's office, and in vacation as well as in term," may make orders and issue process. The revised section omits all reference to the nature of the action or proceeding and enumeration of the acts which may be performed by the court. This is in accord with Rules 45(c) and 56 of the new Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure which contain similar provisions with respect to criminal procedure both in the courts of appeals and in the district courts.
<br>
<br>Rules 6(c) and 77(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure contain provisions similar to the second and first paragraphs, respectively, of this section with respect to civil actions in district courts.
<br>
<br>Editorial Notes
<br>Amendments
<br>
<br>1963—Pub. L. 88–139 substituted "expiration of sessions" for "terms" in section catchline, and "session" for "term" in text.
<br>§453. Oaths of justices and judges
<br>
<br>Each justice or judge of the United States shall take the following oath or affirmation before performing the duties of his office: "I, ______ XXX, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich, and that I will faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent upon me as ______ under the Constitution and laws of the United States.

<br>This section consolidates sections 11–203 and 11–303 of District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., and section 372 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with that portion of section 241 of said title 28 providing that judges of the Court of Claims shall take an oath of office. The remainder of said section 241 comprises sections 171 and 173 of this title.
<br>
<br>The phrase "justice or judge of the United States" was substituted for "justices of the Supreme Court, the circuit judges, and the district judges" appearing in said section 372, in order to extend the provisions of this section to judges of the Court of Claims, Customs Court, and Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and to all judges of any court which may be created by enactment of Congress. See definition in section 451 of this title.
<br>
<br>The Attorney General has ruled that the expression "any judge of any court of the United States" applied to the Chief Justice and all judges of the Court of Claims. (21 Op. Atty. Gen. 449.)

<br>
<br>(1) Where he has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party, or personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding;
<br>
<br>(2) Where in private practice he served as lawyer in the matter in controversy, or a lawyer with whom he previously practiced law served during such association as a lawyer concerning the matter, or the judge or such lawyer has been a material witness concerning it;
<br>
<br>(3) Where he has served in governmental employment and in such capacity participated as counsel, adviser or material witness concerning the proceeding or expressed an opinion concerning the merits of the particular case in controversy;
<br>

<br>
<br>(5) He or his spouse, or a person within the third degree of relationship to either of them, or the spouse of such a person:
<br>
<br>(i) Is a party to the proceeding, or an officer, director, or trustee of a party;

<br>
<br>(c) A judge should inform himself about his personal and fiduciary financial interests, and make a reasonable effort to inform himself about the personal financial interests of his spouse and minor children residing in his household.
<br>
<br>(d) For the purposes of this section the following words or phrases shall have the meaning indicated:
<br>
<br>(1) "proceeding" includes pretrial, trial, appellate review, or other stages of litigation;
<br>
<br>(2) the degree of relationship is calculated according to the civil law system;
<br>
<br>(3) "fiduciary" includes such relationships as executor, administrator, trustee, and guardian;

<br>
<br>(i) Ownership in a mutual or common investment fund that holds securities is not a "financial interest" in such securities unless the judge participates in the management of the fund;
<br>
<br>(ii) An office in an educational, religious, charitable, fraternal, or civic organization is not a "financial interest" in securities held by the organization;
<br>

<br>(iv) Ownership of government securities is a "financial interest" in the issuer only if the outcome of the proceeding could substantially affect the value of the securities.
<br>
<br>(e) No justice, judge, or magistrate judge shall accept from the parties to the proceeding a waiver of any ground for disqualification enumerated in subsection (b). Where the ground for disqualification arises only under subsection (a), waiver may be accepted provided it is preceded by a full disclosure on the record of the basis for disqualification.
<br>
<br>(f) Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this section, if any justice, judge, magistrate judge, or bankruptcy judge to whom a matter has been assigned would be disqualified, after substantial judicial time has been devoted to the matter, because of the appearance or discovery, after the matter was assigned to him or her, that he or she individually or as a fiduciary, or his or her spouse or minor child residing in his or her household, has a financial interest in a party (other than an interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome), disqualification is not required if the justice, judge, magistrate judge, bankruptcy judge, spouse or minor child, as the case may be, divests himself or herself of the interest that provides the grounds for the disqualification.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §24 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §20, 36 Stat. 1090).
<br>
<br>Section 24 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., applied only to district judges. The revised section is made applicable to all justices and judges of the United States.
<br>
<br>The phrase "in which he has a substantial interest" was substituted for "concerned in interest in any suit."
<br>
<br>The provision of section 24 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., as to giving notice of disqualification to the "senior circuit judge," and words "and thereupon such proceedings shall be had as are provided in sections 17 and 18 of this title," were omitted as unnecessary and covered by section 291 et seq. of this title relating to designation and assignment of judges. Such provision is not made by statute in case of disqualification or incapacity, for other cause. See sections 140, 143, and 144 of this title. If a judge or clerk of court is remiss in failing to notify the chief judge of the district or circuit, the judicial council of the circuit has ample power under section 332 of this title to apply a remedy.
<br>
<br>Relationship to a party's attorney is included in the revised section as a basis of disqualification in conformity with the views of judges cognizant of the grave possibility of undesirable consequences resulting from a less inclusive rule.
<br>
<br>Changes were made in phraseology.

<br>
<br>Section 270 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., related to the Chief Justice and each judge of the Court of Claims and provided for payment of expenses on order of court.
<br>
<br>Sections 296, 296a of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., provided for payment of such expenses of the Customs Court judges.
<br>
<br>Section 302 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., provided for the payment of expenses of a judge of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals upon his certificate. It contained no $10 limitation upon his daily subsistence expense and in addition authorized the necessary expenses for travel and attendance of one stenographic clerk who accompanied him. This latter provision is the basis for section 834 of this title. Other provisions of said section 302 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in sections 214 and 452 of this title.
<br>
<br>Section 374 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., related to circuit justices, circuit judges and district judges, including district judges in Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. References to these territories is omitted as unnecessary. Provision for Alaska judges is covered by section 460 of this title, and section 114 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions, as amended by a separate section in the bill to enact this revision. Hawaii and Puerto Rico are included as districts by sections 91 and 119 of this title, and judges thereof are "judges of the United States" as defined in section 451 of this title.
<br>
<br>The inconsistent provision of said section 270 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with reference to payment on order of court was omitted to permit payment to every judge on his certificate.
<br>
<br>The $10 per day subsistence limitation applicable to all other judges was extended to the judges of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.
<br>
<br>The provision of said section 270 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to traveling expenses of commissioners and stenographers is incorporated in sections 792 and 794 of this title.
<br>
<br>The provisions of said section 296 of title 28, U.S.C., 940 ed., relating to organization of the Customs Court are the basis of sections 251, 252, 253, and 254 of this title. Other provisions of said section 296 are incorporated in sections 1581, 2071, 2639, and 2640 of this title, and the retirement provisions of that section are covered by sections 371 and 372 of this title.
<br>
<br>The provision of section 296 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., expenses of retired judges was made applicable to all judges.
<br>
<br>The provision of section 218 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for payment of travel expenses of judges attending the Judicial Conference of the United States was omitted as covered by the first paragraph of the revised section.
<br>
<br>The provision in section 218 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., requiring the marshal of the Supreme Court to pay the expenses of attending the Judicial Conference of the United States is omitted as covered in part by section 550 [see 571] of this title under which United States marshals pay the travel allowances of circuit, district, and certain other judges. The expenses of the Chief Justice of the United States in attending such Conference were required also under said section 218 to be paid by the Supreme Court marshal. Such requirement is also omitted upon advice of the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts that the matter of payment is one of administrative convenience. As to manner of payment of salaries to active and retired Justices of the Supreme Court, see reviser's note under section 550 [see 571] of this title.
<br>
<br>Words "justice or judge of the United States" were used to describe members of all courts. See definitive section 451 of this title.
<br>
<br>The remaining provisions of sections 218 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to the Judicial Conference of the United States and 449 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to judicial conferences of circuits, are incorporated in sections 331 and 333, respectively.
<br>
<br>Said section 1102(d) of title 26, U.S.C., 1940 ed., related to traveling and subsistence expenses of judges of The Tax Court of the United States, successor to the Board of Tax Appeals.
<br>
<br>Numerous changes were made in phraseology.
<br>Senate Revision Amendments
<br>
<br>Those provisions of this section which related to the Tax Court were eliminated by Senate amendment, therefore section 1102(d) of title 26, U.S.C., was not one of the sources of this section as finally enacted.
<br>
<br>As finally enacted, part of act July 9, 1947, ch. 211, title IV, 61 Stat. 303, which was classified to title 28, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §296a, became one of the sources of this section and was accordingly included in the schedule of repeals by Senate amendment. See 80th Congress Senate Report No. 1559.

L. 99–550, §3, Oct. 27, 1986, 100 Stat. 3070, directed Director of Administrative Office of United States Courts, within one year after Oct. 27, 1986, to prepare, in consultation with Marshal of Supreme Court of United States, Clerk of United States Court of Military Appeals, and Court Administrator of United States Tax Court, and transmit to Congress, appropriate recommendations concerning transportation needs of judicial branch and of courts established pursuant to Article I of the Constitution.
<br>Promulgation of Regulations by Director
<br>
<br>Director to promulgate regulations effectuating increases in reimbursement for expenses, see section 6 of Pub. L. 87–139, Aug. 14, 1961, 75 Stat. 340, set out as a note under section 604 of this title.
<br>§457. Records; obsolete papers
<br>
<br>The records of district courts and of courts of appeals shall be kept at one or more of the places where court is held. Such places shall be designated by the respective courts except when otherwise directed by the judicial council of the circuit.
<br>
<br>Papers of any court established by Act of Congress which have become obsolete and are no longer necessary or useful, may be disposed of with the approval of the court concerned in the manner provided by sections 366–380 of Title 44 and in accordance with the rules of the Judicial Conference of the United States.

<br>(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 908; Pub. L. 95–598, title II, §216, Nov. 6, 1978, 92 Stat. 2661.)
<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§10, 523a, 523b, (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §6, 36 Stat. 1088; June 3, 1930, ch. 396, §§1, 2, 46 Stat. 496).
<br>
<br>Section consolidates and simplifies sections 10, 523a and 523b of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to filing district court records and destroying obsolete papers and bankruptcy proofs of claims.
<br>
<br>The revised section enlarges scope of section 10 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., to include places of keeping records of courts of appeals which was not covered by existing law.
<br>
<br>The provisions in section 10 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that where court is held "at more than one place" and the place of keeping the records "is not specially provided by law, they shall be kept at either of the places" designated by the court, was changed to permit the judicial councils of the circuits to make the determination without requiring special enactment of Congress. See section 332 of this title as to purpose and duties of the judicial councils.
<br>
<br>The provision of section 523a of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., authorizing destruction of records by the Attorney General was rewritten in the second paragraph to give such authority, respecting court records, to the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. Such Director, under section 604 of this title, now exercises administrative authority over clerks and commissioners.
<br>
<br>A similar provision with respect to records of United States attorneys and marshals was omitted as superseded by sections 366 and 380 of title 44, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Public Printing and Documents, which prescribe the exclusive method for disposition of such papers.
<br>
<br>Substantial changes were made in phraseology and arrangement.

<br>
<br>Pub. L. 105–300, §1(b), Oct. 27, 1998, 112 Stat. 2837, provided that: "This Act [amending this section] shall take effect on the date of enactment of this Act [Oct. 27, 1998] and shall apply only to any individual whose nomination is submitted to the Senate on or after such date."

<br>
<br>(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 908.)
<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§264, 385, section 1509 of title 19, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Customs Duties, and section 1114(a) of title 26, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Internal Revenue Code (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §§158, 268, 36 Stat. 1139, 1163; June 17, 1930, ch. 497, title IV, §509, 46 Stat. 733; Feb. 10, 1939, ch. 2, §1114(a), 53 Stat. 160; Oct. 21, 1942, ch. 619, title V, §504(a), (c), 56 Stat. 957; Feb. 25, 1944, ch. 63, title V, §503, 58 Stat. 72).
<br>
<br>Section consolidates provisions of sections 264 and 385 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., section 1509 of title 19, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and section 1114(a) of title 26, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to administration of oaths and acknowledgments by judges and courts.
<br>
<br>The provision of section 385 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., giving to "all courts of the United States" power to impose and administer all necessary oaths is the only part of such section in this title. The remainder is incorporated in section 401 of revised title 18, U.S.C. (H.R. 1600, 80th Cong.), Crimes and Criminal Procedure.
<br>
<br>Section 264 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., related only to the Court of Claims and provision of such section relating to clerks and deputies is incorporated in section 953 of this title.
<br>
<br>Section 1509 of title 19, U.S.C., 1940 ed., related only to the Customs Court.
<br>
<br>Section 1114(a) of title 26, U.S.C., 1940 ed., related only to The Tax Court. That portion of such section authorizing certain employees of The Tax Court to administer oaths and acknowledgments is incorporated in section 953 of this title. For distribution of other provisions thereof, see Distribution Table.
<br>
<br>The revised section clarifies what was apparently a statutory omission in that no provision was made with reference to the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, the judges of which now will have the same power respecting administering oaths as judges of other courts.
<br>Senate Revision Amendment
<br>
<br>By Senate amendment, all provisions relating to the Tax Court were eliminated, therefore, as finally enacted, section 1114(a) of Title 26, U.S.C., Internal Revenue Code, did not constitute part of the source of this section. However, no change in the text of this section was necessary. See 80th Congress Senate Report No. 1559.
<br>§460. Application to other courts
<br>
<br>(a) Sections 452 through 459 and section 462 of this chapter shall also apply to the United States Court of Federal Claims, to each court created by Act of Congress in a territory which is invested with any jurisdiction of a district court of the United States, and to the judges thereof.
<br>
<br>(b) The official duty station of each judge referred to in subsection (a) which is not otherwise established by law shall be that place where the court holds regular sessions at or near which the judge performs a substantial portion of his judicial work, which is nearest the place where he maintains his actual abode in which he customarily lives.
