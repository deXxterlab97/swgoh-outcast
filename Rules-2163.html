<br>
<br>The Legislature shall submit to the Oversight Board the Territory Budget adopted by the Legislature by the time specified in the notice delivered under subsection (a). The Oversight Board shall determine whether the adopted Territory Budget is a compliant budget and—
<br>
<br>(A) if the adopted Territory Budget is a compliant budget, the Oversight Board shall issue a compliance certification for such compliant budget pursuant to subsection (e); and
<br>
<br>(B) if the adopted Territory Budget is not a compliant budget, the Oversight Board shall provide to the Legislature—
<br>
<br>(i) a notice of violation that includes a description of any necessary corrective action; and
<br>
<br>(ii) an opportunity to correct the violation in accordance with paragraph (2).
<br>(2) Legislature's revisions
<br>
<br>The Legislature may correct any violations identified by the Oversight Board and submit a revised Territory Budget to the Oversight Board in accordance with the process established under paragraph (1) and by the time specified in the notice delivered under subsection (a). The Legislature may submit as many revised adopted Territory Budgets to the Oversight Board as the schedule established in the notice delivered under subsection (a) permits. If the Legislature fails to adopt a Territory Budget that the Oversight Board determines is a compliant budget by the time specified in the notice delivered under subsection (a), the Oversight Board shall develop a revised Territory Budget that is a compliant budget and submit it to the Governor and the Legislature.
<br>(e) Certification of Budgets
<br>(1) Certification of developed and approved Territory Budgets
<br>
<br>If the Governor and the Legislature develop and approve a Territory Budget that is a compliant budget by the day before the first day of the fiscal year for which the Territory Budget is being developed and in accordance with the process established under subsections (c) and (d), the Oversight Board shall issue a compliance certification to the Governor and the Legislature for such Territory Budget.
<br>(2) Certification of developed Instrumentality Budgets
<br>
<br>If the Governor develops an Instrumentality Budget that is a compliant budget by the day before the first day of the fiscal year for which the Instrumentality Budget is being developed and in accordance with the process established under subsection (c), the Oversight Board shall issue a compliance certification to the Governor for such Instrumentality Budget.
<br>(3) Deemed certification of Territory Budgets
<br>
<br>If the Governor and the Legislature fail to develop and approve a Territory Budget that is a compliant budget by the day before the first day of the fiscal year for which the Territory Budget is being developed, the Oversight Board shall submit a Budget to the Governor and the Legislature (including any revision to the Territory Budget made by the Oversight Board pursuant to subsection (d)(2)) and such Budget shall be—
<br>
<br>(A) deemed to be approved by the Governor and the Legislature;
<br>
<br>(B) the subject of a compliance certification issued by the Oversight Board to the Governor and the Legislature; and
<br>
<br>(C) in full force and effect beginning on the first day of the applicable fiscal year.
<br>(4) Deemed certification of Instrumentality Budgets
<br>
<br>If the Governor fails to develop an Instrumentality Budget that is a compliant budget by the day before the first day of the fiscal year for which the Instrumentality Budget is being developed, the Oversight Board shall submit an Instrumentality Budget to the Governor (including any revision to the Instrumentality Budget made by the Oversight Board pursuant to subsection (c)(2)) and such Budget shall be—
<br>
<br>(A) deemed to be approved by the Governor;
<br>
<br>(B) the subject of a compliance certification issued by the Oversight Board to the Governor; and
<br>
<br>(C) in full force and effect beginning on the first day of the applicable fiscal year.

<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 114–187, title II, §202, June 30, 2016, 130 Stat. 566.)
<br>§2143. Effect of finding of noncompliance with Budget
<br>(a) Submission of reports
<br>
<br>Not later than 15 days after the last day of each quarter of a fiscal year (beginning with the fiscal year determined by the Oversight Board), the Governor shall submit to the Oversight Board a report, in such form as the Oversight Board may require, describing—
<br>
<br>(1) the actual cash revenues, cash expenditures, and cash flows of the territorial government for the preceding quarter, as compared to the projected revenues, expenditures, and cash flows contained in the certified Budget for such preceding quarter; and
<br>
<br>(2) any other information requested by the Oversight Board, which may include a balance sheet or a requirement that the Governor provide information for each covered territorial instrumentality separately.
<br>(b) Initial action by Oversight Board
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>If the Oversight Board determines, based on reports submitted by the Governor under subsection (a), independent audits, or such other information as the Oversight Board may obtain, that the actual quarterly revenues, expenditures, or cash flows of the territorial government are not consistent with the projected revenues, expenditures, or cash flows set forth in the certified Budget for such quarter, the Oversight Board shall—
<br>
<br>(A) require the territorial government to provide such additional information as the Oversight Board determines to be necessary to explain the inconsistency; and
<br>
<br>(B) if the additional information provided under subparagraph (A) does not provide an explanation for the inconsistency that the Oversight Board finds reasonable and appropriate, advise the territorial government to correct the inconsistency by implementing remedial action.
<br>(2) Deadlines
<br>
<br>The Oversight Board shall establish the deadlines by which the territorial government shall meet the requirements of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1).
<br>(c) Certification
<br>(1) Inconsistency
<br>
<br>If the territorial government fails to provide additional information under subsection (b)(1)(A), or fails to correct an inconsistency under subsection (b)(1)(B), prior to the applicable deadline under subsection (b)(2), the Oversight Board shall certify to the President, the House of Representatives Committee on Natural Resources, the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, the Governor, and the Legislature that the territorial government is inconsistent with the applicable certified Budget, and shall describe the nature and amount of the inconsistency.
<br>(2) Correction
<br>
<br>If the Oversight Board determines that the territorial government has initiated such measures as the Oversight Board considers sufficient to correct an inconsistency certified under paragraph (1), the Oversight Board shall certify the correction to the President, the House of Representatives Committee on Natural Resources, the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, the Governor, and the Legislature.
<br>(d) Budget reductions by Oversight Board
<br>
<br>If the Oversight Board determines that the Governor, in the case of any then-applicable certified Instrumentality Budgets, and the Governor and the Legislature, in the case of the then-applicable certified Territory Budget, have failed to correct an inconsistency identified by the Oversight Board under subsection (c), the Oversight Board shall—
<br>
<br>(1) with respect to the territorial government, other than covered territorial instrumentalities, make appropriate reductions in nondebt expenditures to ensure that the actual quarterly revenues and expenditures for the territorial government are in compliance with the applicable certified Territory Budget or, in the case of the fiscal year in which the Oversight Board is established, the budget adopted by the Governor and the Legislature; and
<br>
<br>(2) with respect to covered territorial instrumentalities at the sole discretion of the Oversight Board—
<br>
<br>(A) make reductions in nondebt expenditures to ensure that the actual quarterly revenues and expenses for the covered territorial instrumentality are in compliance with the applicable certified Budget or, in the case of the fiscal year in which the Oversight Board is established, the budget adopted by the Governor and the Legislature or the covered territorial instrumentality, as applicable; or
<br>
<br>(B)(i) institute automatic hiring freezes at the covered territorial instrumentality; and
<br>
<br>(ii) prohibit the covered territorial instrumentality from entering into any contract or engaging in any financial or other transactions, unless the contract or transaction was previously approved by the Oversight Board.
<br>(e) Termination of Budget reductions
<br>
<br>The Oversight Board shall cancel the reductions, hiring freezes, or prohibition on contracts and financial transactions under subsection (d) if the Oversight Board determines that the territorial government or covered territorial instrumentality, as applicable, has initiated appropriate measures to reduce expenditures or increase revenues to ensure that the territorial government or covered territorial instrumentality is in compliance with the applicable certified Budget or, in the case of the fiscal year in which the Oversight Board is established, the budget adopted by the Governor and the Legislature.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 114–187, title II, §203, June 30, 2016, 130 Stat. 568.)
<br>§2144. Review of activities to ensure compliance with Fiscal Plan
<br>(a) Submission of legislative acts to Oversight Board
<br>(1) Submission of acts
<br>
<br>Except to the extent that the Oversight Board may provide otherwise in its bylaws, rules, and procedures, not later than 7 business days after a territorial government duly enacts any law during any fiscal year in which the Oversight Board is in operation, the Governor shall submit the law to the Oversight Board.
<br>(2) Cost estimate; certification of compliance or noncompliance
<br>
<br>The Governor shall include with each law submitted to the Oversight Board under paragraph (1) the following:
<br>
<br>(A) A formal estimate prepared by an appropriate entity of the territorial government with expertise in budgets and financial management of the impact, if any, that the law will have on expenditures and revenues.
<br>
<br>(B) If the appropriate entity described in subparagraph (A) finds that the law is not significantly inconsistent with the Fiscal Plan for the fiscal year, it shall issue a certification of such finding.
<br>
<br>(C) If the appropriate entity described in subparagraph (A) finds that the law is significantly inconsistent with the Fiscal Plan for the fiscal year, it shall issue a certification of such finding, together with the entity's reasons for such finding.
<br>(3) Notification
<br>
<br>The Oversight Board shall send a notification to the Governor and the Legislature if—
<br>
<br>(A) the Governor submits a law to the Oversight Board under this subsection that is not accompanied by the estimate required under paragraph (2)(A);
<br>
<br>(B) the Governor submits a law to the Oversight Board under this subsection that is not accompanied by either a certification described in paragraph (2)(B) or (2)(C); or
<br>
<br>(C) the Governor submits a law to the Oversight Board under this subsection that is accompanied by a certification described in paragraph (2)(C) that the law is significantly inconsistent with the Fiscal Plan.
<br>(4) Opportunity to respond to notification
<br>(A) Failure to provide estimate or certification
<br>
<br>After sending a notification to the Governor and the Legislature under paragraph (3)(A) or (3)(B) with respect to a law, the Oversight Board may direct the Governor to provide the missing estimate or certification (as the case may be), in accordance with such procedures as the Oversight Board may establish.
<br>(B) Submission of certification of significant inconsistency with Fiscal Plan and Budget
<br>
<br>In accordance with such procedures as the Oversight Board may establish, after sending a notification to the Governor and Legislature under paragraph (3)(C) that a law is significantly inconsistent with the Fiscal Plan, the Oversight Board shall direct the territorial government to—
<br>
<br>(i) correct the law to eliminate the inconsistency; or
<br>
<br>(ii) provide an explanation for the inconsistency that the Oversight Board finds reasonable and appropriate.
<br>(5) Failure to comply
<br>
<br>If the territorial government fails to comply with a direction given by the Oversight Board under paragraph (4) with respect to a law, the Oversight Board may take such actions as it considers necessary, consistent with this chapter, to ensure that the enactment or enforcement of the law will not adversely affect the territorial government's compliance with the Fiscal Plan, including preventing the enforcement or application of the law.
<br>(6) Preliminary review of proposed acts
<br>
<br>At the request of the Legislature, the Oversight Board may conduct a preliminary review of proposed legislation before the Legislature to determine whether the legislation as proposed would be consistent with the applicable Fiscal Plan under this subtitle,1 except that any such preliminary review shall not be binding on the Oversight Board in reviewing any law subsequently submitted under this subsection.
<br>(b) Effect of approved Fiscal Plan on contracts, rules, and regulations
<br>(1) Transparency in contracting
<br>
<br>The Oversight Board shall work with a covered territory's office of the comptroller or any functionally equivalent entity to promote compliance with the applicable law of any covered territory that requires agencies and instrumentalities of the territorial government to maintain a registry of all contracts executed, including amendments thereto, and to remit a copy to the office of the comptroller for inclusion in a comprehensive database available to the public. With respect to Puerto Rico, the term "applicable law" refers to 2 L.P.R.A. 97, as amended.
<br>(2) Authority to review certain contracts
<br>
<br>The Oversight Board may establish policies to require prior Oversight Board approval of certain contracts, including leases and contracts to a governmental entity or government-owned corporations rather than private enterprises that are proposed to be executed by the territorial government, to ensure such proposed contracts promote market competition and are not inconsistent with the approved Fiscal Plan.
<br>(3) Sense of Congress
<br>
<br>It is the sense of Congress that any policies established by the Oversight Board pursuant to paragraph (2) should be designed to make the government contracting process more effective, to increase the public's faith in this process, to make appropriate use of the Oversight Board's time and resources, to make the territorial government a facilitator and not a competitor to private enterprise, and to avoid creating any additional bureaucratic obstacles to efficient contracting.
<br>(4) Authority to review certain rules, regulations, and executive orders
<br>
<br>The provisions of this paragraph shall apply with respect to a rule, regulation, or executive order proposed to be issued by the Governor (or the head of any department or agency of the territorial government) in the same manner as such provisions apply to a contract.
<br>(5) Failure to comply
<br>
<br>If a contract, rule, regulation, or executive order fails to comply with policies established by the Oversight Board under this subsection, the Oversight Board may take such actions as it considers necessary to ensure that such contract, rule, executive order or regulation will not adversely affect the territorial government's compliance with the Fiscal Plan, including by preventing the execution or enforcement of the contract, rule, executive order or regulation.
<br>(c) Restrictions on budgetary adjustments
<br>(1) Submissions of requests to Oversight Board
<br>
<br>If the Governor submits a request to the Legislature for the reprogramming of any amounts provided in a certified Budget, the Governor shall submit such request to the Oversight Board, which shall analyze whether the proposed reprogramming is significantly inconsistent with the Budget, and submit its analysis to the Legislature as soon as practicable after receiving the request.
<br>(2) No action permitted until analysis received
<br>
<br>The Legislature shall not adopt a reprogramming, and no officer or employee of the territorial government may carry out any reprogramming, until the Oversight Board has provided the Legislature with an analysis that certifies such reprogramming will not be inconsistent with the Fiscal Plan and Budget.
<br>(3) Prohibition on action until Oversight Board is appointed
<br>
<br>(A) During the period after a territory becomes a covered territory and prior to the appointment of all members and the Chair of the Oversight Board, such covered territory shall not enact new laws that either permit the transfer of any funds or assets outside the ordinary course of business or that are inconsistent with the constitution or laws of the territory as of June 30, 2016, provided that any executive or legislative action authorizing the movement of funds or assets during this time period may be subject to review and rescission by the Oversight Board upon appointment of the Oversight Board's full membership.
<br>
<br>(B) Upon appointment of the Oversight Board's full membership, the Oversight Board may review, and in its sole discretion, rescind, any law that—
<br>
<br>(i) was enacted during the period between, with respect to Puerto Rico, May 4, 2016; or with respect to any other territory, 45 days prior to the establishment of the Oversight Board for such territory, and the date of appointment of all members and the Chair of the Oversight Board; and
<br>
<br>(ii) alters pre-existing priorities of creditors in a manner outside the ordinary course of business or inconsistent with the territory's constitution or the laws of the territory as of, in the case of Puerto Rico, May 4, 2016, or with respect to any other territory, 45 days prior to the establishment of the Oversight Board for such territory;
<br>
<br>but such rescission shall only be to the extent that the law alters such priorities.
<br>(d) Implementation of Federal programs
<br>
<br>In taking actions under this chapter, the Oversight Board shall not exercise applicable authorities to impede territorial actions taken to—
<br>
<br>(1) comply with a court-issued consent decree or injunction, or an administrative order or settlement with a Federal agency, with respect to Federal programs;
<br>
<br>(2) implement a federally authorized or federally delegated program;
<br>
<br>(3) implement territorial laws, which are consistent with a certified Fiscal Plan, that execute Federal requirements and standards; or
<br>
<br>(4) preserve and maintain federally funded mass transportation assets.

<br>
<br>The Oversight Board, after the issuance of a certification pursuant to section 2124(j) of this title, may modify the plan at any time before confirmation, but may not modify the plan so that the plan as modified fails to meet the requirements of this subchapter.

<br>(a) Objection
<br>
<br>A special tax payer may object to confirmation of a plan.
<br>(b) Confirmation

<br>(1) the plan complies with the provisions of title 11, made applicable to a case under this subchapter by section 2161 of this title;
<br>
<br>(2) the plan complies with the provisions of this subchapter;
<br>
<br>(3) the debtor is not prohibited by law from taking any action necessary to carry out the plan;
<br>
<br>(4) except to the extent that the holder of a particular claim has agreed to a different treatment of such claim, the plan provides that on the effective date of the plan each holder of a claim of a kind specified in 507(a)(2) 1 of title 11 will receive on account of such claim cash equal to the allowed amount of such claim;
<br>
<br>(5) any legislative, regulatory, or electoral approval necessary under applicable law in order to carry out any provision of the plan has been obtained, or such provision is expressly conditioned on such approval;
<br>
<br>(6) the plan is feasible and in the best interests of creditors, which shall require the court to consider whether available remedies under the non-bankruptcy laws and constitution of the territory would result in a greater recovery for the creditors than is provided by such plan; and
<br>
<br>(7) the plan is consistent with the applicable Fiscal Plan certified by the Oversight Board under subchapter II.
<br>(c) Confirmation for debtors with a single class of claims

<br>
<br>the court shall confirm the plan notwithstanding the requirements of such sections 1129(a)(8) and 1129(a)(10) of title 11 if the plan is fair and equitable and does not discriminate unfairly with respect to such impaired class.

<br>
<br>(2) submitting or modifying a plan of adjustment under sections 2172 and 2173 of this title; or

<br>(a) Compensation for services rendered and reimbursement for expenses
<br>
<br>After notice to the parties in interest and the United States Trustee and a hearing, the court may award to a professional person employed by the debtor (in the debtor's sole discretion), the Oversight Board (in the Oversight Board's sole discretion), a committee under section 1103 of title 11, or a trustee appointed by the court under section 926 of title 11—
<br>
<br>(1) reasonable compensation for actual, necessary services rendered by the professional person, or attorney and by any paraprofessional person employed by any such person; and
<br>
<br>(2) reimbursement for actual, necessary expenses.

<br>
<br>The court may, on its own motion or on the motion of the United States Trustee or any other party in interest, award compensation that is less than the amount of compensation that is requested.
<br>(c) Factors considered
<br>
<br>In determining the amount of reasonable compensation to be awarded to a professional person, the court shall consider the nature, the extent, and the value of such services, taking into account all relevant factors, including—
<br>
<br>(1) the time spent on such services;
<br>
<br>(2) the rates charged for such services;
<br>
<br>(3) whether the services were necessary to the administration of, or beneficial at the time at which the service was rendered toward the completion of, a case under this chapter; 1
<br>
<br>(4) whether the services were performed within a reasonable amount of time commensurate with the complexity, importance, and nature of the problem, issue, or task addressed;
<br>
<br>(5) with respect to a professional person, whether the person is board certified or otherwise has demonstrated skill and experience in the restructuring field; and
<br>
<br>(6) whether the compensation is reasonable based on the customary compensation charged by comparably skilled practitioners in cases other than cases under this subchapter or title 11.
<br>(d) Services ineligible for compensation
<br>
<br>The court shall not allow compensation for—
<br>
<br>(1) unnecessary duplication of services; or
<br>
<br>(2) services that were not—
<br>
<br>(A) reasonably likely to benefit the debtor; or
<br>
<br>(B) necessary to the administration of the case.
<br>(e) Offset for interim compensation under section 2177 of this title
<br>
<br>The court shall reduce the amount of compensation awarded under this section by the amount of any interim compensation awarded under section 2177 of this title, and, if the amount of such interim compensation exceeds the amount of compensation awarded under this section, may order the return of the excess to the debtor.
<br>(f) Compensation for preparation of fee application
<br>
<br>Any compensation awarded for the preparation of a fee application shall be based on the level and skill reasonably required to prepare the application.

<br>(b) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, the establishment of an Oversight Board for Puerto Rico (i.e., the enactment of this chapter) in accordance with section 2121 of this title operates with respect to a Liability as a stay, applicable to all entities (as such term is defined in section 101 of title 11), of—
<br>
<br>(1) the commencement or continuation, including the issuance or employment of process, of a judicial, administrative, or other action or proceeding against the Government of Puerto Rico that was or could have been commenced before the enactment of this chapter, or to recover a Liability Claim against the Government of Puerto Rico that arose before the enactment of this chapter;

<br>
<br>(6) any act to collect, assess, or recover a Liability Claim against the Government of Puerto Rico that arose before the enactment of this chapter; and
<br>
<br>(7) the setoff of any debt owing to the Government of Puerto Rico that arose before the enactment of this chapter against any Liability Claim against the Government of Puerto Rico.
<br>(c) Stay not operable
<br>
<br>The establishment of an Oversight Board for Puerto Rico in accordance with section 2121 of this title does not operate as a stay—
<br>
<br>(1) solely under subsection (b)(1) of this section, of the continuation of, including the issuance or employment of process, of a judicial, administrative, or other action or proceeding against the Government of Puerto Rico that was commenced on or before December 18, 2015; or
<br>
<br>(2) of the commencement or continuation of an action or proceeding by a governmental unit to enforce such governmental unit's or organization's police and regulatory power, including the enforcement of a judgment other than a money judgment, obtained in an action or proceeding by the governmental unit to enforce such governmental unit's or organization's police or regulatory power.
<br>(d) Continuation of stay
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subsections (e), (f), and (g) the stay under subsection (b) continues until the earlier of—
<br>
<br>(1) the later of—
<br>
<br>(A) the later of—
<br>
<br>(i) February 15, 2017; or
<br>
<br>(ii) six months after the establishment of an Oversight Board for Puerto Rico as established by section 2121(b) of this title;
<br>
<br>(B) the date that is 75 days after the date in subparagraph (A) if the Oversight Board delivers a certification to the Governor that, in the Oversight Board's sole discretion, an additional 75 days are needed to seek to complete a voluntary process under subchapter VI of this chapter with respect to the government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or any of its territorial instrumentalities; or
<br>
<br>(C) the date that is 60 days after the date in subparagraph (A) if the district court to which an application has been submitted under subparagraph 1 2231(m)(1)(D) of this title determines, in the exercise of the court's equitable powers, that an additional 60 days are needed to complete a voluntary process under subchapter VI of this chapter with respect to the government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or any of its territorial instrumentalities; or
<br>
<br>(2) with respect to the government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or any of its territorial instrumentalities, the date on which a case is filed by or on behalf of the government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or any of its territorial instrumentalities, as applicable, under subchapter III.
<br>(e) Jurisdiction, relief from stay
<br>
<br>(1) The United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction of any civil actions arising under or related to this section.
<br>
<br>(2) On motion of or action filed by a party in interest and after notice and a hearing, the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, for cause shown, shall grant relief from the stay provided under subsection (b) of this section.
<br>(f) Termination of stay; hearing
<br>
<br>Forty-five days after a request under subsection (e)(2) for relief from the stay of any act against property of the Government of Puerto Rico under subsection (b), such stay is terminated with respect to the party in interest making such request, unless the court, after notice and a hearing, orders such stay continued in effect pending the conclusion of, or as a result of, a final hearing and determination under subsection (e)(2). A hearing under this subsection may be a preliminary hearing, or may be consolidated with the final hearing under subsection (e)(2). The court shall order such stay continued in effect pending the conclusion of the final hearing under subsection (e)(2) if there is a reasonable likelihood that the party opposing relief from such stay will prevail at the conclusion of such final hearing. If the hearing under this subsection is a preliminary hearing, then such final hearing shall be concluded not later than thirty days after the conclusion of such preliminary hearing, unless the thirty-day period is extended with the consent of the parties in interest or for a specific time which the court finds is required by compelling circumstances.
<br>(g) Relief to prevent irreparable damage
<br>
<br>Upon request of a party in interest, the court, with or without a hearing, shall grant such relief from the stay provided under subsection (b) as is necessary to prevent irreparable damage to the interest of an entity in property, if such interest will suffer such damage before there is an opportunity for notice and a hearing under subsection (e) or (f).
<br>(h) Act in violation of stay is void
<br>
<br>Any order, judgment, or decree entered in violation of this section and any act taken in violation of this section is void, and shall have no force or effect, and any person found to violate this section may be liable for damages, costs, and attorneys' fees incurred in defending any action taken in violation of this section, and the Oversight Board or the Government of Puerto Rico may seek an order from the court enforcing the provisions of this section.
<br>(i) Government of Puerto Rico
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, the term "Government of Puerto Rico", in addition to the definition set forth in section 2104(11) of this title, shall include—
<br>
<br>(1) the individuals, including elected and appointed officials, directors, officers of and employees acting in their official capacity on behalf of the Government of Puerto Rico; and
<br>
<br>(2) the Oversight Board, including the directors and officers of and employees acting in their official capacity on behalf of the Oversight Board.
<br>(j) No default under existing contracts
<br>
<br>(1) Notwithstanding any contractual provision or applicable law to the contrary and so long as a stay under this section is in effect, the holder of a Liability Claim or any other claim (as such term is defined in section 101 of title 11) may not exercise or continue to exercise any remedy under a contract or applicable law in respect to the Government of Puerto Rico or any of its property—
<br>
<br>(A) that is conditioned upon the financial condition of, or the commencement of a restructuring, insolvency, bankruptcy, or other proceeding (or a similar or analogous process) by, the Government of Puerto Rico, including a default or an event of default thereunder; or
<br>
<br>(B) with respect to Liability Claims—
<br>
<br>(i) for the non-payment of principal or interest; or
<br>
<br>(ii) for the breach of any condition or covenant.
<br>
<br>(2) The term "remedy" as used in paragraph (1) shall be interpreted broadly, and shall include any right existing in law or contract, including any right to—
<br>
<br>(A) setoff;
<br>
<br>(B) apply or appropriate funds;
<br>
<br>(C) seek the appointment of a custodian (as such term is defined in section 101(11) of title 11);
<br>
<br>(D) seek to raise rates; or
<br>
<br>(E) exercise control over property of the Government of Puerto Rico.
<br>
<br>(3) Notwithstanding any contractual provision or applicable law to the contrary and so long as a stay under this section is in effect, a contract to which the Government of Puerto Rico is a party may not be terminated or modified, and any right or obligation under such contract may not be terminated or modified, solely because of a provision in such contract is conditioned on—
<br>
<br>(A) the insolvency or financial condition of the Government of Puerto Rico at any time prior to the enactment of this chapter;
<br>
<br>(B) the adoption of a resolution or establishment of an Oversight Board pursuant to section 2121 of this title; or
<br>
<br>(C) a default under a separate contract that is due to, triggered by, or a result of the occurrence of the events or matters in paragraph (1)(B).
<br>
<br>(4) Notwithstanding any contractual provision to the contrary and so long as a stay under this section is in effect, a counterparty to a contract with the Government of Puerto Rico for the provision of goods and services shall, unless the Government of Puerto Rico agrees to the contrary in writing, continue to perform all obligations under, and comply with the terms of, such contract, provided that the Government of Puerto Rico is not in default under such contract other than as a result of a condition specified in paragraph (3).
<br>(k) Effect
<br>
<br>This section does not discharge an obligation of the Government of Puerto Rico or release, invalidate, or impair any security interest or lien securing such obligation. This section does not impair or affect the implementation of any restructuring support agreement executed by the Government of Puerto Rico to be implemented pursuant to Puerto Rico law specifically enacted for that purpose prior to the enactment of this chapter or the obligation of the Government of Puerto Rico to proceed in good faith as set forth in any such agreement.
<br>(l) Payments on Liabilities
<br>
<br>Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the Government of Puerto Rico from making any payment on any Liability when such payment becomes due during the term of the stay, and to the extent the Oversight Board, in its sole discretion, determines it is feasible, the Government of Puerto Rico shall make interest payments on outstanding indebtedness when such payments become due during the length of the stay.
<br>(m) Findings
<br>
<br>Congress finds the following:
<br>
<br>(1) A combination of severe economic decline, and, at times, accumulated operating deficits, lack of financial transparency, management inefficiencies, and excessive borrowing has created a fiscal emergency in Puerto Rico.
<br>
<br>(2) As a result of its fiscal emergency, the Government of Puerto Rico has been unable to provide its citizens with effective services.
<br>
<br>(3) The current fiscal emergency has also affected the long-term economic stability of Puerto Rico by contributing to the accelerated outmigration of residents and businesses.
<br>
<br>(4) A comprehensive approach to fiscal, management, and structural problems and adjustments that exempts no part of the Government of Puerto Rico is necessary, involving independent oversight and a Federal statutory authority for the Government of Puerto Rico to restructure debts in a fair and orderly process.
<br>
<br>(5) Additionally, an immediate—but temporary—stay is essential to stabilize the region for the purposes of resolving this territorial crisis.
<br>
<br>(A) The stay advances the best interests common to all stakeholders, including but not limited to a functioning independent Oversight Board created pursuant to this chapter to determine whether to appear or intervene on behalf of the Government of Puerto Rico in any litigation that may have been commenced prior to the effectiveness or upon expiration of the stay.
<br>
<br>(B) The stay is limited in nature and narrowly tailored to achieve the purposes of this chapter, including to ensure all creditors have a fair opportunity to consensually renegotiate terms of repayment based on accurate financial information that is reviewed by an independent authority or, at a minimum, receive a recovery from the Government of Puerto Rico equal to their best possible outcome absent the provisions of this chapter.
<br>
<br>(6) Finally, the ability of the Government of Puerto Rico to obtain funds from capital markets in the future will be severely diminished without congressional action to restore its financial accountability and stability.
