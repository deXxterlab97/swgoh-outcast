<br>Executive Documents
<br>Promoting the Reliable Supply and Delivery of Water in the West
<br>
<br>Memorandum of President of the United States, Oct. 19, 2018, 83 F.R. 53961, provided:
<br>
<br>Memorandum for the Secretary of the Interior[,] the Secretary of Commerce[,] the Secretary of Energy[,] the Secretary of the Army[, and] the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality
<br>
<br>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct the following:
<br>
<br>Section 1. Policy. During the 20th Century, the Federal Government invested enormous resources in water infrastructure throughout the western United States to reduce flood risks to communities; to provide reliable water supplies for farms, families, businesses, and fish and wildlife; and to generate dependable hydropower. Decades of uncoordinated, piecemeal regulatory actions have diminished the ability of our Federal infrastructure, however, to deliver water and power in an efficient, cost-effective way.
<br>
<br>Unless addressed, fragmented regulation of water infrastructure will continue to produce inefficiencies, unnecessary burdens, and conflict among the Federal Government, States, tribes, and local public agencies that deliver water to their citizenry. To meet these challenges, the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce should, to the extent permitted by law, work together to minimize unnecessary regulatory burdens and foster more efficient decision-making so that water projects are better able to meet the demands of their authorized purposes.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. Streamlining Western Water Infrastructure Regulatory Processes and Removing Unnecessary Burdens. To address water infrastructure challenges in the western United States, the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce shall undertake the following actions:
<br>
<br>(a) Within 30 days of the date of this memorandum [Oct. 19, 2018], the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce shall:
<br>
<br>(i) identify major water infrastructure projects in California for which the Department of the Interior and the Department of Commerce have joint responsibility under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) (Public Law 93–205) [16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.] or individual responsibilities under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (Public Law 91–190) [42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.]; and
<br>
<br>(ii) for each such project, work together to facilitate the designation of one official to coordinate the agencies' ESA and NEPA compliance responsibilities. Within the 30-day time period provided by this subsection, the designated official shall also identify regulations and procedures that potentially burden the project and develop a proposed plan, for consideration by the Secretaries, to appropriately suspend, revise, or rescind any regulations or procedures that unduly burden the project beyond the degree necessary to protect the public interest or otherwise comply with the law. For purposes of this memorandum, "burden" means to unnecessarily obstruct, delay, curtail, impede, or otherwise impose significant costs on the permitting, utilization, transmission, delivery, or supply of water resources and infrastructure.
<br>
<br>(b) Within 40 days of the date of this memorandum, the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce shall develop a timeline for completing applicable environmental compliance requirements for projects identified under section 2(a)(i) of this memorandum. Environmental compliance requirements shall be completed as expeditiously as possible, and in accordance with applicable law.
<br>
<br>(c) To the maximum extent practicable and consistent with applicable law, including the authorities granted to the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce under the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (Public Law 114–322):
<br>
<br>(i) The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce shall ensure that the ongoing review of the long-term coordinated operations of the Central Valley Project and the California State Water Project is completed and an updated Plan of Operations and Record of Decision is issued.
<br>
<br>(ii) The Secretary of the Interior shall issue final biological assessments for the long-term coordinated operations of the Central Valley Project and the California State Water Project not later than January 31, 2019.
<br>
<br>(iii) The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce shall ensure the issuance of their respective final biological opinions for the long-term coordinated operations of the Central Valley Project and the California State Water Project within 135 days of the deadline provided in section 2(c)(ii) of this memorandum. To the extent practicable and consistent with law, these shall be joint opinions.
<br>
<br>(iv) The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce shall complete the joint consultation presently underway for the Klamath Irrigation Project by August 2019.
<br>
<br>(d) The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce shall provide monthly updates to the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality and other components of the Executive Office of the President, as appropriate, regarding progress in meeting the established timelines.
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. Improve Forecasts of Water Availability. To facilitate greater use of forecast-based management and use of authorities and capabilities provided by the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2017 (Public Law 115–25) [15 U.S.C. 8501 et seq.] and other applicable laws, the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce shall convene water experts and resource managers to develop an action plan to improve the information and modeling capabilities related to water availability and water infrastructure projects. The action plan shall be completed by January 2019 and submitted to the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality.
<br>
<br>Sec. 4. Improving Use of Technology to Increase Water Reliability. To the maximum extent practicable, and pursuant to the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater Study and Facilities Act (Public Law 102–575, title XVI) [43 U.S.C. 390h et seq.], the Water Desalination Act of 1996 (Public Law 104–298) [42 U.S.C. 10301 note], and other applicable laws, the Secretary of the Interior shall direct appropriate bureaus to promote the expanded use of technology for improving the accuracy and reliability of water and power deliveries. This promotion of expanded use should include:
<br>
<br>(a) investment in technology and reduction of regulatory burdens to enable broader scale deployment of desalination technology;
<br>
<br>(b) investment in technology and reduction of regulatory burdens to enable broader scale use of recycled water; and
<br>
<br>(c) investment in programs that promote and encourage innovation, research, and development of technology that improve water management, using best available science through real-time monitoring of wildlife and water deliveries.
<br>
<br>Sec. 5. Consideration of Locally Developed Plans in Hydroelectric Projects Licensing. To the extent the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce participate in Federal Energy Regulatory Commission licensing activities for hydroelectric projects, and to the extent permitted by law, the Secretaries shall give appropriate consideration to any relevant information available to them in locally developed plans, where consistent with the best available information.
<br>
<br>Sec. 6. Streamlining Regulatory Processes and Removing Unnecessary Burdens on the Columbia River Basin Water Infrastructure. In order to address water and hydropower operations challenges in the Columbia River Basin, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Energy, and the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works under the direction of the Secretary of the Army, shall develop a schedule to complete the Columbia River System Operations Environmental Impact Statement and the associated Biological Opinion due by 2020. The schedule shall be submitted to the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality within 60 days of the date of this memorandum.
<br>
<br>Sec. 7. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
<br>
<br>(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or
<br>
<br>(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
<br>
<br>(b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
<br>
<br>(c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
<br>
<br>(d) The Secretary of the Interior is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

<br>
<br>(A) 10 percent of the cost of construction of the portion of the project which has a depth not in excess of 20 feet; plus
<br>
<br>(B) 25 percent of the cost of construction of the portion of the project which has a depth in excess of 20 feet but not in excess of 50 feet; plus
<br>
<br>(C) 50 percent of the cost of construction of the portion of the project which has a depth in excess of 50 feet.
<br>(2) Additional 10 percent payment over 30 years
<br>
<br>The non-Federal interests for a project to which paragraph (1) applies shall pay an additional 10 percent of the cost of the general navigation features of the project in cash over a period not to exceed 30 years, at an interest rate determined pursuant to section 2216 of this title. The value of lands, easements, rights-of-way, and relocations provided under paragraph (3) and the costs of relocations borne by the non-Federal interests under paragraph (4) shall be credited toward the payment required under this paragraph.
<br>(3) Lands, easements, and rights-of-way
<br>
<br>Except as provided under section 2283(c) of this title, the non-Federal interests for a project to which paragraph (1) applies shall provide the lands, easements, rights-of-way, and relocations (other than utility relocations under paragraph (4)) necessary for the project, including any lands, easements, rights-of-way, and relocations (other than utility relocations accomplished under paragraph (4)) that are necessary for dredged material disposal facilities.
<br>(4) Utility relocations
<br>
<br>The non-Federal interests for a project to which paragraph (1) applies shall perform or assure the performance of all relocations of utilities necessary to carry out the project, except that in the case of a project for a deep-draft harbor and in the case of a project constructed by non-Federal interests under section 2232 of this title, one-half of the cost of each such relocation shall be borne by the owner of the facility being relocated and one-half of the cost of each such relocation shall be borne by the non-Federal interests.
<br>(5) Dredged material disposal facilities for project construction
<br>
<br>In this subsection, the term "general navigation features" includes constructed land-based and aquatic dredged material disposal facilities that are necessary for the disposal of dredged material required for project construction and for which a contract for construction has not been awarded on or before October 12, 1996.

<br>(2) Dredged material disposal facilities
<br>
<br>The Federal share of the cost of constructing land-based and aquatic dredged material disposal facilities that are necessary for the disposal of dredged material required for the operation and maintenance of a project and for which a contract for construction has not been awarded on or before October 12, 1996, shall be determined in accordance with subsection (a). The Federal share of operating and maintaining such facilities shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (1).
<br>(c) Erosion or shoaling attributable to Federal navigation works
<br>
<br>Costs of constructing projects or measures for the prevention or mitigation of erosion or shoaling damages attributable to Federal navigation works shall be shared in the same proportion as the cost sharing provisions applicable to the project causing such erosion or shoaling. The non-Federal interests for the project causing the erosion or shoaling shall agree to operate and maintain such measures.
<br>(d) Non-Federal payments during construction
<br>
<br>The amount of any non-Federal share of the cost of any navigation project for a harbor or inland harbor shall be paid to the Secretary.

<br>§2214. General credit for flood control
<br>(a) Guidelines
<br>
<br>Within one year after November 17, 1986, the Secretary shall issue guidelines to carry out this section, consistent with the principles and guidelines on project formulation. The guidelines shall include criteria for determining whether work carried out by non-Federal interests is compatible with a project for flood control and procedures for making such determinations. The guidelines under this section shall be promulgated after notice in the Federal Register and opportunity for comment.
<br>(b) Analysis of costs and benefits
<br>
<br>The guidelines established under subsection (a) shall provide for the Secretary to consider, in analyzing the costs and benefits of a proposed project for flood control, the costs and benefits produced by any flood control work carried out by non-Federal interests that the Secretary determines to be compatible with the project. For purposes of the preceding sentence the Secretary may consider only work carried out after the date which is 5 years before the first obligation of funds for the reconnaissance study for such project. In no case may work which was carried out more than 5 years before November 17, 1986, be considered under this subsection, unless otherwise provided in this Act.
<br>(c) Crediting of non-Federal share
<br>
<br>The guidelines established under subsection (a) shall provide for crediting the cost of work carried out by the non-Federal interests against the non-Federal share of the cost of an authorized project for flood control as follows:
<br>
<br>(1) Work which is carried out after the end of the reconnaissance study and before the submission to Congress of the final report of the Chief of Engineers on the project and which is determined by the Secretary to be compatible with the project shall be included as part of the project and shall be recommended by the Secretary in the final report for credit against the non-Federal share of the cost of the project.
<br>
<br>(2) Work which is carried out after submission of the final report of the Chief of Engineers to Congress and which is determined by the Secretary to be compatible with the project shall be considered as part of the project and shall be credited by the Secretary against the non-Federal share of the cost of the project in accordance with the guidelines promulgated pursuant to subsection (a).
<br>
<br>In no event may work which was carried out more than 5 years before November 17, 1986, be considered under this subsection, unless otherwise provided in this Act.
<br>(d) Procedure for work done before November 17, 1986
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall consider, under subsections (b) and (c), work carried out before November 17, 1986, by non-Federal interests on a project for flood control, if the non-Federal interests apply to the Secretary for consideration of such work not later than March 31, 1987. The Secretary shall make determinations under subsections (b) and (c) with respect to such work not later than 6 months after guidelines are issued under subsection (a).
<br>(e) Procedure for work done after November 17, 1986
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall consider work carried out after November 17, 1986, by non-Federal interests on a project for flood control under subsections (b) and (c) in accordance with the guidelines issued under subsection (a). The guidelines shall require prior approval by the Secretary of any flood control work carried out after November 17, 1986, in order to be considered under this section, taking into account the economic and environmental feasibility of the project.
<br>(f) Limitation not applicable
<br>
<br>Any flood control work included as part of the non-Federal share of the cost of a project under this section shall not be subject to the limitation contained in the last sentence of section 1962d–5a(a) of title 42.
<br>(g) Cash contribution not affected
<br>
<br>Nothing in this section affects the requirement of section 2213(a)(1)(A) of this title.

<br>§2215. Feasibility studies; planning, engineering, and design
<br>(a) Feasibility studies
<br>(1) Cost sharing
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall not initiate any feasibility study for a water resources project after November 17, 1986, until appropriate non-Federal interests agree, by contract, to contribute 50 percent of the cost of the study.
<br>(B) Payment of cost share during period of study
<br>
<br>During the period of the study, the non-Federal share of the cost of the study payable under subparagraph (A) shall be 50 percent of the sum of—
<br>
<br>(i) the cost estimate for the study as contained in the feasibility cost-sharing agreement; and
<br>
<br>(ii) any excess of the cost of the study over the cost estimate if the excess results from—
<br>
<br>(I) a change in Federal law; or
<br>
<br>(II) a change in the scope of the study requested by the non-Federal interests.
<br>(C) Payment of cost share on authorization of project or termination of study
<br>(i) Project timely authorized
<br>
<br>Except as otherwise agreed to by the Secretary and the non-Federal interests and subject to clause (ii), the non-Federal share of any excess of the cost of the study over the cost estimate (excluding any excess cost described in subparagraph (B)(ii)) shall be payable on the date on which the Secretary and the non-Federal interests enter into an agreement pursuant to section 2211(e) or 2213(j) of this title with respect to the project.
<br>(ii) Project not timely authorized
<br>
<br>If the project that is the subject of the study is not authorized by the date that is 5 years after the completion of the final report of the Chief of Engineers concerning the study or the date that is 2 years after the termination of the study, the non-Federal share of any excess of the cost of the study over the cost estimate (excluding any excess cost described in subparagraph (B)(ii)) shall be payable to the United States on that date.
<br>(D) Amendment of cost estimate
<br>
<br>The cost estimate referred to in subparagraph (B)(i) may be amended only by agreement of the Secretary and the non-Federal interests.
<br>(E) In-kind contributions
<br>
<br>The non-Federal share required under this paragraph may be satisfied by the provision of services, materials, supplies, or other in-kind services necessary to prepare the feasibility report.
<br>(2) Applicability
<br>
<br>This subsection shall not apply to any water resources study primarily designed for the purposes of navigational improvements in the nature of dams, locks, and channels on the Nation's system of inland waterways.
<br>(3) Detailed project reports
<br>
<br>The requirements of this subsection that apply to a feasibility study also shall apply to a study that results in a detailed project report, except that—
<br>
<br>(A) the first $100,000 of the costs of a study that results in a detailed project report shall be a Federal expense; and
<br>
<br>(B) paragraph (1)(C)(ii) shall not apply to such a study.
<br>(b) Planning and engineering
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall not initiate any planning or engineering for a water resources project until appropriate non-Federal interests agree, by contract, to contribute 50 percent of the cost of the planning and engineering during the period of the planning and engineering. Costs of planning and engineering of projects for which non-Federal interests contributed 50 percent of the cost of the feasibility study shall be treated as costs of construction.
<br>(c) Design
<br>
<br>Costs of design of a water resources project shall be shared in the same percentage as the purposes of such project.
<br>(d) Definitions
<br>
<br>In this section, the following definitions apply:
<br>(1) Detailed project report
<br>
<br>The term "detailed project report" means a report for a project not specifically authorized by Congress in law or otherwise that determines the feasibility of the project with a level of detail appropriate to the scope and complexity of the recommended solution and sufficient to proceed directly to the preparation of contract plans and specifications. The term includes any associated environmental impact statement and mitigation plan. For a project for which the Federal cost does not exceed $1,000,000, the term includes a planning and design analysis document.
<br>(2) Feasibility study
<br>
<br>The term "feasibility study" means a study that results in a feasibility report under section 2282 of this title, and any associated environmental impact statement and mitigation plan, prepared by the Corps of Engineers for a water resources project. The term includes a study that results in a project implementation report prepared under title VI of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (114 Stat. 2680–2694), a general reevaluation report, and a limited reevaluation report.
