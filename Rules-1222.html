<br>If the Secretary of the Treasury determines that initiation of international discussions with regard to such authority would (A) result in material increase in the discount at which sovereign debt is sold, (B) materially increase the probability of default on such debt, or (C) materially enhance the likelihood of debt service failure or disruption, the Secretary shall include in his interim reports to the Congress an explanation in detail of the reasons for such determination.
<br>(3) Initiation of discussions
<br>
<br>Unless such a determination is made, the Secretary of the Treasury shall initiate discussions with such industrialized and developing countries as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate with the intent to negotiate the establishment of the International Debt Management Authority, which would undertake to—
<br>
<br>(A) purchase sovereign debt of less developed countries from private creditors at an appropriate discount;
<br>
<br>(B) enter into negotiations with the debtor countries for the purpose of restructuring the debt in order to—
<br>
<br>(i) ease the current debt service burden on the debtor countries; and
<br>
<br>(ii) provide additional opportunities for economic growth in both debtor and industrialized countries; and
<br>
<br>(C) assist the creditor banks in the voluntary disposition of their Third World loan portfolio.
<br>(b) Objectives
<br>
<br>In any discussions initiated under subsection (a), the Secretary should include the following specific proposals:
<br>
<br>(1) That any loan restructuring assistance provided by such an authority to any debtor nation should involve substantial commitments by the debtor to (A) economic policies designed to improve resource utilization and minimize capital flight, and (B) preparation of an economic management plan calculated to provide sustained economic growth and to allow the debtor to meet its restructured debt obligations.
<br>
<br>(2) That support for such an authority should come from industrialized countries, and that greater support should be expected from countries with strong current account surpluses.
<br>
<br>(3) That such an authority should have a clearly defined close working relationship with the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the various regional development banks.
<br>
<br>(4) That such an authority should be designed to operate as a self-supporting entity, requiring no routine appropriation of resources from any member government, and to function subject to the prohibitions contained in the first sentence of section 5332(a) of this title.
<br>
<br>(5) That such an authority should have a defined termination date and a clear proposal for the restoration of creditworthiness to debtor countries within this timeframe.
<br>(c) Interim reports
<br>
<br>At the end of the 6-month period beginning on August 23, 1988, and at the end of the 12-month period beginning on August 23, 1988, the Secretary of the Treasury shall submit a report on the progress being made on the study or in discussions described in subsection (a) to the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate, and shall consult with such committees after submitting each such report.
<br>(d) Final report
<br>
<br>On the conclusion of the study or of discussions described in subsection (a), the Secretary shall transmit a report containing a detailed description thereof to the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate, together with such recommendations for legislation which the Secretary may determine to be necessary or appropriate for the establishment of the International Debt Management Authority.

<br>§5342. Requirement of national treatment in underwriting government debt instruments
<br>(a) Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) United States companies can successfully compete in foreign markets if they are given fair access to such markets;
<br>
<br>(2) a trade surplus in services could offset the deficit in manufactured goods and help lower the overall trade deficit significantly;
<br>
<br>(3) in contrast to the barriers faced by United States firms in Japan, Japanese firms generally have enjoyed access to United States financial markets on the same terms as United States firms; and
<br>
<br>(4) United States firms seeking to compete in Japan face or have faced a variety of discriminatory barriers effectively precluding such firms from fairly competing for Japanese business, including—
<br>
<br>(A) limitations on membership on the Tokyo Stock Exchange;
<br>
<br>(B) high fixed commission rates (ranging as high as 80 percent) which must be paid to members of the exchange by nonmembers for executing trades;
<br>
<br>(C) unequal opportunities to participate in and act as lead manager for equity and bond underwritings;
<br>
<br>(D) restrictions on access to automated teller machines;
<br>
<br>(E) arbitrarily applied employment requirements for opening branch offices;
<br>
<br>(F) long delays in processing applications and granting approvals for licenses to operate; and
<br>
<br>(G) restrictions on foreign institutions' participation in Ministry of Finance policy advisory councils.
<br>(b) Designation of certain persons as primary dealers prohibited
<br>(1) General rule
<br>
<br>Neither the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System nor the Federal Reserve Bank of New York may designate, or permit the continuation of any prior designation of, any person of a foreign country as a primary dealer in government debt instruments if such foreign country does not accord to United States companies the same competitive opportunities in the underwriting and distribution of government debt instruments issued by such country as such country accords to domestic companies of such country.
<br>(2) Certain prior acquisitions excepted
<br>
<br>Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the continuation of the prior designation of a company as a primary dealer in government debt instruments if—
<br>
<br>(A) such designation occurred before July 31, 1987; and
<br>
<br>(B) before July 31, 1987—
<br>
<br>(i) control of such company was acquired from a person (other than a person of a foreign country) by a person of a foreign country; or
<br>
<br>(ii) in conjunction with a person of a foreign country, such company informed the Federal Reserve Bank of New York of the intention of such person to acquire control of such company.
<br>(c) Exception for countries having or negotiating bilateral agreements with United States
<br>
<br>Subsection (b) shall not apply to any person of a foreign country if—
<br>
<br>(1) that country, as of January 1, 1987, was negotiating a bilateral agreement with the United States under the authority of section 2112(b)(4)(A) of title 19; or
<br>
<br>(2) that country has a bilateral free trade area agreement with the United States which entered into force before January 1, 1987.
<br>(d) "Person of a foreign country" defined
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, a person is a "person of a foreign country" if that person, or any other person which directly or indirectly owns or controls that person, is a resident of that country, is organized under the laws of that country, or has its principal place of business in that country.
<br>(e) Effective date
