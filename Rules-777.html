<br>A defendant who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of Y2K upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that—
<br>
<br>(A) the defendant previously made a reasonable good faith effort to anticipate, prevent, and effectively remediate a potential Y2K failure;
<br>
<br>(B) a Y2K upset occurred as a result of a Y2K failure or other emergency directly related to a Y2K failure;
<br>
<br>(C) noncompliance with the applicable federally enforceable measurement, monitoring, or reporting requirement was unavoidable in the face of an emergency directly related to a Y2K failure and was necessary to prevent the disruption of critical functions or services that could result in harm to life or property;
<br>
<br>(D) upon identification of noncompliance the defendant invoking the defense began immediate actions to correct any violation of federally enforceable measurement, monitoring, or reporting requirements; and
<br>
<br>(E) the defendant submitted notice to the appropriate Federal regulatory authority of a Y2K upset within 72 hours from the time that the defendant became aware of the upset.
<br>(4) Grant of a Y2K upset defense
<br>
<br>Subject to the other provisions of this subsection, the Y2K upset defense shall be a complete defense to the imposition of a penalty in any action brought as a result of noncompliance with federally enforceable measurement, monitoring, or reporting requirements for any defendant who establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that the conditions set forth in paragraph (3) are met.
<br>(5) Length of Y2K upset
<br>
<br>The maximum allowable length of the Y2K upset shall be not more than 15 days beginning on the date of the upset unless specific relief by the appropriate regulatory authority is granted.
<br>(6) Fraudulent invocation of Y2K upset defense
<br>
<br>Fraudulent use of the Y2K upset defense provided for in this subsection shall be subject to the sanctions provided in section 1001 of title 18.

<br>Nothing in this subsection shall affect the authority of a government entity to seek injunctive relief or require a defendant to correct a violation of a federally enforceable measurement, monitoring, or reporting requirement.
<br>(h) Consumer protection from Y2K failures
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>No person who transacts business on matters directly or indirectly affecting residential mortgages shall cause or permit a foreclosure on any such mortgage against a consumer as a result of an actual Y2K failure that results in an inability to accurately or timely process any mortgage payment transaction.
<br>(2) Notice
<br>
<br>A consumer who is affected by an inability described in paragraph (1) shall notify the servicer for the mortgage, in writing and within 7 business days from the time that the consumer becomes aware of the Y2K failure and the consumer's inability to accurately or timely fulfill his or her obligation to pay, of such failure and inability and shall provide to the servicer any available documentation with respect to the failure.
<br>(3) Actions may resume after grace period
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding paragraph (1), an action prohibited under paragraph (1) may be resumed, if the consumer's mortgage obligation has not been paid and the servicer of the mortgage has not expressly and in writing granted the consumer an extension of time during which to pay the consumer's mortgage obligation, but only after the later of—
<br>
<br>(A) four weeks after January 1, 2000; or

<br>(6) Definition
<br>
<br>In this subsection—
<br>
<br>(A) The term "consumer" means a natural person.
<br>
<br>(B) The term "residential mortgage" has the meaning given the term "federally related mortgage loan" under section 2602 of title 12.

<br>§6605. Proportionate liability
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>Except in a Y2K action that is a contract action, and except as provided in subsections (b) through (g), a person against whom a final judgment is entered in a Y2K action shall be liable solely for the portion of the judgment that corresponds to the relative and proportionate responsibility of that person. In determining the percentage of responsibility of any defendant, the trier of fact shall determine that percentage as a percentage of the total fault of all persons, including the plaintiff, who caused or contributed to the total loss incurred by the plaintiff.
<br>(b) Proportionate liability
<br>(1) Determination of responsibility
<br>
<br>In any Y2K action that is not a contract action, the court shall instruct the jury to answer special interrogatories, or, if there is no jury, the court shall make findings with respect to each defendant, including defendants who have entered into settlements with the plaintiff or plaintiffs, concerning—
<br>
<br>(A) the percentage of responsibility, if any, of each defendant, measured as a percentage of the total fault of all persons who caused or contributed to the loss incurred by the plaintiff; and
<br>
<br>(B) if alleged by the plaintiff, whether the defendant (other than a defendant who has entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiff)—
<br>
<br>(i) acted with specific intent to injure the plaintiff; or
<br>
<br>(ii) knowingly committed fraud.
<br>(2) Contents of special interrogatories or findings
<br>
<br>The responses to interrogatories or findings under paragraph (1) shall specify the total amount of damages that the plaintiff is entitled to recover and the percentage of responsibility of each defendant found to have caused or contributed to the loss incurred by the plaintiff.
<br>(3) Factors for consideration
<br>
<br>In determining the percentage of responsibility under this subsection, the trier of fact shall consider—
<br>
<br>(A) the nature of the conduct of each person found to have caused or contributed to the loss incurred by the plaintiff; and
<br>
<br>(B) the nature and extent of the causal relationship between the conduct of each such person and the damages incurred by the plaintiff.
<br>(c) Joint liability for specific intent or fraud
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding subsection (a), the liability of a defendant in a Y2K action that is not a contract action is joint and several if the trier of fact specifically determines that the defendant—
<br>
<br>(A) acted with specific intent to injure the plaintiff; or
<br>
<br>(B) knowingly committed fraud.
<br>(2) Fraud; recklessness
<br>(A) Knowing commission of fraud described
<br>
<br>For purposes of subsection (b)(1)(B)(ii) and paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, a defendant knowingly committed fraud if the defendant—
<br>
<br>(i) made an untrue statement of a material fact, with actual knowledge that the statement was false;
<br>
<br>(ii) omitted a fact necessary to make the statement not be misleading, with actual knowledge that, as a result of the omission, the statement was false; and
<br>
<br>(iii) knew that the plaintiff was reasonably likely to rely on the false statement.
<br>(B) Recklessness
<br>
<br>For purposes of subsection (b)(1)(B) and paragraph (1) of this subsection, reckless conduct by the defendant does not constitute either a specific intent to injure, or the knowing commission of fraud, by the defendant.
<br>(3) Right to contribution not affected
<br>
<br>Nothing in this section affects the right, under any other law, of a defendant to contribution with respect to another defendant found under subsection (b)(1)(B), or determined under paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, to have acted with specific intent to injure the plaintiff or to have knowingly committed fraud.
<br>(d) Special rules
<br>(1) Uncollectible share
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding subsection (a), if, upon motion made not later than 6 months after a final judgment is entered in any Y2K action that is not a contract action, the court determines that all or part of the share of the judgment against a defendant for compensatory damages is not collectible against that defendant, then each other defendant in the action is liable for the uncollectible share as follows:
<br>(i) Percentage of net worth
<br>
<br>The other defendants are jointly and severally liable for the uncollectible share if the plaintiff establishes that—
<br>
<br>(I) the plaintiff is an individual whose recoverable damages under the final judgment are equal to more than 10 percent of the net worth of the plaintiff; and
<br>
<br>(II) the net worth of the plaintiff is less than $200,000.
<br>(ii) Other plaintiffs
<br>
<br>For a plaintiff not described in clause (i), each of the other defendants is liable for the uncollectible share in proportion to the percentage of responsibility of that defendant.
<br>(iii) Additional liability
<br>
<br>For a plaintiff not described in clause (i), in addition to the share identified in clause (ii), the defendant is liable for an additional portion of the uncollectible share in an amount equal to 50 percent of the amount determined under clause (ii) if the plaintiff demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant acted with reckless disregard for the likelihood that its acts would cause injury of the sort suffered by the plaintiff.
<br>(B) Overall limit
<br>
<br>The total payments required under subparagraph (A) from all defendants may not exceed the amount of the uncollectible share.
<br>(C) Subject to contribution
<br>
<br>A defendant against whom judgment is not collectible is subject to contribution and to any continuing liability to the plaintiff on the judgment.
<br>(D) Suits by consumers
<br>
<br>(i) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the other defendants are jointly and severally liable for the uncollectible share if—
<br>
<br>(I) the plaintiff is a consumer whose suit alleges or arises out of a defect in a consumer product; and
<br>
<br>(II) the plaintiff is suing as an individual and not as part of a class action.
<br>
<br>(ii) In this subparagraph:
<br>
<br>(I) The term "class action" means—
<br>
<br>(aa) a single lawsuit in which: (1) damages are sought on behalf of more than 10 persons or prospective class members; or (2) one or more named parties seek to recover damages on a representative basis on behalf of themselves and other unnamed parties similarly situated; or
<br>
<br>(bb) any group of lawsuits filed in or pending in the same court in which: (1) damages are sought on behalf of more than 10 persons; and (2) the lawsuits are joined, consolidated, or otherwise proceed as a single action for any purpose.
<br>
<br>(II) The term "consumer" means an individual who acquires a consumer product for purposes other than resale.
<br>
<br>(III) The term "consumer product" means any personal property or service which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes.
<br>(2) Special right of contribution
<br>
<br>To the extent that a defendant is required to make an additional payment under paragraph (1), that defendant may recover contribution—
<br>
<br>(A) from the defendant originally liable to make the payment;
<br>
<br>(B) from any other defendant that is jointly and severally liable;
<br>
<br>(C) from any other defendant held proportionately liable who is liable to make the same payment and has paid less than that other defendant's proportionate share of that payment; or
<br>
<br>(D) from any other person responsible for the conduct giving rise to the payment that would have been liable to make the same payment.
<br>(3) Nondisclosure to jury
<br>
<br>The standard for allocation of damages under subsection (a) and subsection (b)(1), and the procedure for reallocation of uncollectible shares under paragraph (1) of this subsection, shall not be disclosed to members of the jury.
<br>(e) Settlement discharge
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>A defendant who settles a Y2K action that is not a contract action at any time before final verdict or judgment shall be discharged from all claims for contribution brought by other persons. Upon entry of the settlement by the court, the court shall enter an order constituting the final discharge of all obligations to the plaintiff of the settling defendant arising out of the action. The order shall bar all future claims for contribution arising out of the action—
<br>
<br>(A) by any person against the settling defendant; and
<br>
<br>(B) by the settling defendant against any person other than a person whose liability has been extinguished by the settlement of the settling defendant.
<br>(2) Reduction
<br>
<br>If a defendant enters into a settlement with the plaintiff before the final verdict or judgment, the verdict or judgment shall be reduced by the greater of—
<br>
<br>(A) an amount that corresponds to the percentage of responsibility of that defendant; or
<br>
<br>(B) the amount paid to the plaintiff by that defendant.
<br>(f) General right of contribution
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>A defendant who is jointly and severally liable for damages in any Y2K action that is not a contract action may recover contribution from any other person who, if joined in the original action, would have been liable for the same damages. A claim for contribution shall be determined based on the percentage of responsibility of the claimant and of each person against whom a claim for contribution is made.
<br>(2) Statute of limitations for contribution
<br>
<br>An action for contribution in connection with a Y2K action that is not a contract action shall be brought not later than 6 months after the entry of a final, nonappealable judgment in the Y2K action, except that an action for contribution brought by a defendant who was required to make an additional payment under subsection (d)(1) may be brought not later than 6 months after the date on which such payment was made.
<br>(g) More protective State law not preempted
<br>
<br>Nothing in this section preempts or supersedes any provision of State law that—
<br>
<br>(1) limits the liability of a defendant in a Y2K action to a lesser amount than the amount determined under this section; or
<br>
<br>(2) otherwise affords a greater degree of protection from joint or several liability than is afforded by this section.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 106–37, §6, July 20, 1999, 113 Stat. 192.)
<br>§6606. Prelitigation notice
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>Before commencing a Y2K action, except an action that seeks only injunctive relief, a prospective plaintiff in a Y2K action shall send a written notice by certified mail (with either return receipt requested or other means of verification that the notice was sent) to each prospective defendant in that action. The notice shall provide specific and detailed information about—
<br>
<br>(1) the manifestations of any material defect alleged to have caused harm or loss;
<br>
<br>(2) the harm or loss allegedly suffered by the prospective plaintiff;
<br>
<br>(3) how the prospective plaintiff would like the prospective defendant to remedy the problem;
<br>
<br>(4) the basis upon which the prospective plaintiff seeks that remedy; and
<br>
<br>(5) the name, title, address, and telephone number of any individual who has authority to negotiate a resolution of the dispute on behalf of the prospective plaintiff.
<br>(b) Person to whom notice to be sent
<br>
<br>The notice required by subsection (a) shall be sent—
<br>
<br>(1) to the registered agent of the prospective defendant for service of legal process;
<br>
<br>(2) if the prospective defendant does not have a registered agent, then to the chief executive officer if the prospective defendant is a corporation, to the managing partner if the prospective defendant is a partnership, to the proprietor if the prospective defendant is a sole proprietorship, or to a similarly-situated person if the prospective defendant is any other enterprise; or
<br>
<br>(3) if the prospective defendant has designated a person to receive prelitigation notices on a Year 2000 Internet Website (as defined in section 3(7) of the Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act), to the designated person, if the prospective plaintiff has reasonable access to the Internet.
<br>(c) Response to notice
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Within 30 days after receipt of the notice specified in subsection (a), each prospective defendant shall send by certified mail with return receipt requested to each prospective plaintiff a written statement acknowledging receipt of the notice, and describing the actions it has taken or will take to address the problem identified by the prospective plaintiff.
<br>(2) Willingness to engage in ADR
<br>
<br>The written statement shall state whether the prospective defendant is willing to engage in alternative dispute resolution.
<br>(3) Inadmissibility
<br>
<br>A written statement required by this subsection is not admissible in evidence, under Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence or any analogous rule of evidence in any State, in any proceeding to prove liability for, or the invalidity of, a claim or its amount, or otherwise as evidence of conduct or statements made in compromise negotiations.
<br>(4) Presumptive time of receipt
<br>
<br>For purposes of paragraph (1), a notice under subsection (a) is presumed to be received 7 days after it was sent.
<br>(5) Priority
<br>
<br>A prospective defendant receiving more than one notice under this section may give priority to notices with respect to a product or service that involves a health or safety related Y2K failure.
<br>(d) Failure to respond
<br>
<br>If a prospective defendant—
<br>
<br>(1) fails to respond to a notice provided pursuant to subsection (a) within the 30 days specified in subsection (c)(1); or
<br>
<br>(2) does not describe the action, if any, the prospective defendant has taken, or will take, to address the problem identified by the prospective plaintiff,
<br>
<br>the prospective plaintiff may immediately commence a legal action against that prospective defendant.
<br>(e) Remediation period
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>If the prospective defendant responds and proposes remedial action it will take, or offers to engage in alternative dispute resolution, then the prospective plaintiff shall allow the prospective defendant an additional 60 days from the end of the 30-day notice period to complete the proposed remedial action or alternative dispute resolution before commencing a legal action against that prospective defendant.
<br>(2) Extension by agreement
<br>
<br>The prospective plaintiff and prospective defendant may change the length of the 60-day remediation period by written agreement.
<br>(3) Multiple extensions not allowed
<br>
<br>Except as provided in paragraph (2), a defendant in a Y2K action is entitled to no more than one 30-day period and one 60-day remediation period under paragraph (1).
<br>(4) Statutes of limitation, etc., tolled
<br>
<br>Any applicable statute of limitations or doctrine of laches in a Y2K action to which paragraph (1) applies shall be tolled during the notice and remediation period under that paragraph.
<br>(f) Failure to provide notice
<br>
<br>If a defendant determines that a plaintiff has filed a Y2K action without providing the notice specified in subsection (a) or without awaiting the expiration of the appropriate waiting period specified in subsection (c), the defendant may treat the plaintiff's complaint as such a notice by so informing the court and the plaintiff in its initial response to the plaintiff. If any defendant elects to treat the complaint as such a notice—
<br>
<br>(1) the court shall stay all discovery and all other proceedings in the action for the appropriate period after filing of the complaint; and
<br>
<br>(2) the time for filing answers and all other pleadings shall be tolled during the appropriate period.
<br>(g) Effect of contractual or statutory waiting periods
<br>
<br>In cases in which a contract, or a statute enacted before January 1, 1999, requires notice of nonperformance and provides for a period of delay prior to the initiation of suit for breach or repudiation of contract, the period of delay provided by contract or the statute is controlling over the waiting period specified in subsections (c) and (d).
<br>(h) State law controls alternative methods
<br>
<br>Nothing in this section supersedes or otherwise preempts any State law or rule of civil procedure with respect to the use of alternative dispute resolution for Y2K actions.
<br>(i) Provisional remedies unaffected
<br>
<br>Nothing in this section interferes with the right of a litigant to provisional remedies otherwise available under Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or any State rule of civil procedure providing extraordinary or provisional remedies in any civil action in which the underlying complaint seeks both injunctive and monetary relief.
<br>(j) Special rule for class actions
<br>
<br>For the purpose of applying this section to a Y2K action that is maintained as a class action in Federal or State court, the requirements of the preceding subsections of this section apply only to named plaintiffs in the class action.

<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>A party to a Y2K action making a tort claim, other than a claim of intentional tort arising independent of a contract, may not recover damages for economic loss unless—
<br>
<br>(1) the recovery of such losses is provided for in a contract to which the party seeking to recover such losses is a party; or
<br>
<br>(2) such losses result directly from damage to tangible personal or real property caused by the Y2K failure involved in the action (other than damage to property that is the subject of the contract between the parties to the Y2K action or, in the event there is no contract between the parties, other than damage caused only to the property that experienced the Y2K failure),
<br>
<br>and such damages are permitted under applicable Federal or State law.

<br>(3) losses indirectly suffered as a result of the defendant's wrongful act or omission;
<br>
<br>(4) losses that arise because of the claims of third parties;
<br>
<br>(5) losses that must be pled as special damages; and
<br>
<br>(6) consequential damages (as defined in the Uniform Commercial Code or analogous State commercial law).
<br>(c) Certain other actions
<br>
<br>A person liable for damages, whether by settlement or judgment, in a civil action to which this chapter does not apply because of section 6603(c) of this title whose liability, in whole or in part, is the result of a Y2K failure may, notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, pursue any remedy otherwise available under Federal or State law against the person responsible for that Y2K failure to the extent of recovering the amount of those damages.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 106–37, §12, July 20, 1999, 113 Stat. 199.)
<br>§6612. State of mind; bystander liability; control
<br>(a) Defendant's state of mind
<br>
<br>In a Y2K action other than a claim for breach or repudiation of contract, and in which the defendant's actual or constructive awareness of an actual or potential Y2K failure is an element of the claim, the defendant is not liable unless the plaintiff establishes that element of the claim by the standard of evidence under applicable State law in effect on the day before January 1, 1999.
<br>(b) Limitation on bystander liability for Y2K failures
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>With respect to any Y2K action for money damages in which—
<br>
<br>(A) the defendant is not the manufacturer, seller, or distributor of a product, or the provider of a service, that suffers or causes the Y2K failure at issue;
<br>
<br>(B) the plaintiff is not in substantial privity with the defendant; and
<br>
<br>(C) the defendant's actual or constructive awareness of an actual or potential Y2K failure is an element of the claim under applicable law,
<br>
<br>the defendant shall not be liable unless the plaintiff, in addition to establishing all other requisite elements of the claim, proves, by the standard of evidence under applicable State law in effect on the day before January 1, 1999, that the defendant actually knew, or recklessly disregarded a known and substantial risk, that such failure would occur.
<br>(2) Substantial privity
<br>
<br>For purposes of paragraph (1)(B), a plaintiff and a defendant are in substantial privity when, in a Y2K action arising out of the performance of professional services, the plaintiff and the defendant either have contractual relations with one another or the plaintiff is a person who, prior to the defendant's performance of such services, was specifically identified to and acknowledged by the defendant as a person for whose special benefit the services were being performed.
<br>(3) Certain claims excluded
<br>
<br>For purposes of paragraph (1)(C), claims in which the defendant's actual or constructive awareness of an actual or potential Y2K failure is an element of the claim under applicable law do not include claims for negligence but do include claims such as fraud, constructive fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, negligent misrepresentation, and interference with contract or economic advantage.
<br>(c) Control not determinative of liability
<br>
<br>The fact that a Y2K failure occurred in an entity, facility, system, product, or component that was sold, leased, rented, or otherwise within the control of the party against whom a claim is asserted in a Y2K action shall not constitute the sole basis for recovery of damages in that action. A claim in a Y2K action for breach or repudiation of contract for such a failure is governed by the terms of the contract.
<br>(d) Protections of the Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act apply
<br>
<br>The protections for the exchanges of information provided by section 4 of the Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act (Public Law 105–271) shall apply to any Y2K action.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 106–37, §13, July 20, 1999, 113 Stat. 200.)

<br>§6614. Y2K actions as class actions
<br>(a) Material defect requirement
<br>
<br>A Y2K action involving a claim that a product or service is defective may be maintained as a class action in Federal or State court as to that claim only if—
<br>
<br>(1) it satisfies all other prerequisites established by applicable Federal or State law, including applicable rules of civil procedure; and
<br>
<br>(2) the court finds that the defect in a product or service as alleged would be a material defect for the majority of the members of the class.
<br>(b) Notification
<br>
<br>In any Y2K action that is maintained as a class action, the court, in addition to any other notice required by applicable Federal or State law, shall direct notice of the action to each member of the class, which shall include—
<br>
<br>(1) a concise and clear description of the nature of the action;
<br>
<br>(2) the jurisdiction where the case is pending; and
<br>
<br>(3) the fee arrangements with class counsel, including the hourly fee being charged, or, if it is a contingency fee, the percentage of the final award which will be paid, including an estimate of the total amount that would be paid if the requested damages were to be granted.
<br>(c) Forum for Y2K class actions
<br>(1) Jurisdiction
<br>
<br>Except as provided in paragraph (2), the district courts of the United States shall have original jurisdiction of any Y2K action that is brought as a class action.
<br>(2) Exceptions
<br>
<br>The district courts of the United States shall not have original jurisdiction over a Y2K action brought as a class action if—
<br>
<br>(A)(i) a substantial majority of the members of the proposed plaintiff class are citizens of a single State;
<br>
<br>(ii) the primary defendants are citizens of that State; and
<br>
<br>(iii) the claims asserted will be governed primarily by the laws of that State;
<br>
<br>(B) the primary defendants are States, State officials, or other governmental entities against whom the district courts of the United States may be foreclosed from ordering relief;
<br>
<br>(C) the plaintiff class does not seek an award of punitive damages, and the amount in controversy is less than the sum of $10,000,000 (exclusive of interest and costs), computed on the basis of all claims to be determined in the action; or
<br>
<br>(D) there are less than 100 members of the proposed plaintiff class.
<br>
<br>A party urging that any exception described in subparagraph (A), (B), (C), or (D) applies to an action shall bear the full burden of demonstrating the applicability of the exception.
<br>(3) Procedure if requirements not met
<br>(A) Dismissal or remand
<br>
<br>A United States district court shall dismiss, or, if after removal, strike the class allegations and remand, any Y2K action brought or removed under this subsection as a class action if—
<br>
<br>(i) the action is subject to the jurisdiction of the court solely under this subsection; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the court determines the action may not proceed as a class action based on a failure to satisfy the conditions of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
<br>(B) Amendment; removal
<br>
<br>Nothing in paragraph (A) shall prohibit plaintiffs from filing an amended class action in Federal or State court. A defendant shall have the right to remove such an amended class action to a United States district court under this subsection.
<br>(C) Period of limitations tolled
<br>
<br>Upon dismissal or remand, the period of limitations for any claim that was asserted in an action on behalf of any named or unnamed member of any proposed class shall be deemed tolled to the full extent provided under Federal law.
<br>(D) Dismissal without prejudice
<br>
<br>The dismissal of a Y2K action under subparagraph (A) shall be without prejudice.
<br>(d) Effect on rules of civil procedure
<br>
<br>Except as otherwise provided in this section, nothing in this section supersedes any rule of Federal or State civil procedure applicable to class actions.

<br>

<br>§6617. Suspension of penalties for certain year 2000 failures by small business concerns
<br>(a) Definitions
<br>
<br>In this section—
<br>
<br>(1) the term "agency" means any executive agency, as defined in section 105 of title 5, that has the authority to impose civil penalties on small business concerns;
<br>
<br>(2) the term "first-time violation" means a violation by a small business concern of a federally enforceable rule or regulation (other than a Federal rule or regulation that relates to the safety and soundness of the banking or monetary system or for the integrity of the National Securities markets, including protection of depositors and investors) caused by a Y2K failure if that Federal rule or regulation had not been violated by that small business concern within the preceding 3 years; and
<br>
<br>(3) the term "small business concern" has the same meaning as a defendant described in section 6604(b)(2)(B) of this title.
<br>(b) Establishment of liaisons
<br>
<br>Not later than 30 days after July 20, 1999, each agency shall—
<br>
<br>(1) establish a point of contact within the agency to act as a liaison between the agency and small business concerns with respect to problems arising out of Y2K failures and compliance with Federal rules or regulations; and
<br>
<br>(2) publish the name and phone number of the point of contact for the agency in the Federal Register.
<br>(c) General rule
<br>
<br>Subject to subsections (d) and (e), no agency shall impose any civil money penalty on a small business concern for a first-time violation.
<br>(d) Standards for waiver
<br>
<br>An agency shall provide a waiver of civil money penalties for a first-time violation, provided that a small business concern demonstrates, and the agency determines, that—
<br>
<br>(1) the small business concern previously made a reasonable good faith effort to anticipate, prevent, and effectively remediate a potential Y2K failure;
<br>
<br>(2) a first-time violation occurred as a result of the Y2K failure of the small business concern or other entity, which significantly affected the small business concern's ability to comply with a Federal rule or regulation;
<br>
<br>(3) the first-time violation was unavoidable in the face of a Y2K failure or occurred as a result of efforts to prevent the disruption of critical functions or services that could result in harm to life or property;
<br>
<br>(4) upon identification of a first-time violation, the small business concern initiated reasonable and prompt measures to correct the violation; and
<br>
<br>(5) the small business concern submitted notice to the appropriate agency of the first-time violation within a reasonable time not to exceed 5 business days from the time that the small business concern became aware that the first-time violation had occurred.
<br>(e) Exceptions
<br>
<br>An agency may impose civil money penalties authorized under Federal law on a small business concern for a first-time violation if—
<br>
<br>(1) the small business concern's failure to comply with Federal rules or regulations resulted in actual harm, or constitutes or creates an imminent threat to public health, safety, or the environment; or
<br>
<br>(2) the small business concern fails to correct the violation not later than 1 month after initial notification to the agency.
<br>(f) Expiration
<br>

<br>§6701. Operation of State law
<br>(a) State regulation of the business of insurance
<br>
<br>The Act entitled "An Act to express the intent of Congress with reference to the regulation of the business of insurance" and approved March 9, 1945 (15 U.S.C. 1011 et seq.) (commonly referred to as the "McCarran-Ferguson Act") remains the law of the United States.
<br>(b) Mandatory insurance licensing requirements
<br>
<br>No person shall engage in the business of insurance in a State as principal or agent unless such person is licensed as required by the appropriate insurance regulator of such State in accordance with the relevant State insurance law, subject to subsections (c), (d), and (e).
<br>(c) Affiliations
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in paragraph (2), no State may, by statute, regulation, order, interpretation, or other action, prevent or restrict a depository institution, or an affiliate thereof, from being affiliated directly or indirectly or associated with any person, as authorized or permitted by this Act or any other provision of Federal law.
<br>(2) Insurance
<br>
<br>With respect to affiliations between depository institutions, or any affiliate thereof, and any insurer, paragraph (1) does not prohibit—
<br>
<br>(A) any State from—
<br>
<br>(i) collecting, reviewing, and taking actions (including approval and disapproval) on applications and other documents or reports concerning any proposed acquisition of, or a change or continuation of control of, an insurer domiciled in that State; and
<br>
<br>(ii) exercising authority granted under applicable State law to collect information concerning any proposed acquisition of, or a change or continuation of control of, an insurer engaged in the business of insurance in, and regulated as an insurer by, such State;
<br>
<br>during the 60-day period preceding the effective date of the acquisition or change or continuation of control, so long as the collecting, reviewing, taking actions, or exercising authority by the State does not have the effect of discriminating, intentionally or unintentionally, against a depository institution or an affiliate thereof, or against any other person based upon an association of such person with a depository institution;
<br>
<br>(B) any State from requiring any person that is acquiring control of an insurer domiciled in that State to maintain or restore the capital requirements of that insurer to the level required under the capital regulations of general applicability in that State to avoid the requirement of preparing and filing with the insurance regulatory authority of that State a plan to increase the capital of the insurer, except that any determination by the State insurance regulatory authority with respect to such requirement shall be made not later than 60 days after the date of notification under subparagraph (A); or
<br>
<br>(C) any State from restricting a change in the ownership of stock in an insurer, or a company formed for the purpose of controlling such insurer, after the conversion of the insurer from mutual to stock form so long as such restriction does not have the effect of discriminating, intentionally or unintentionally, against a depository institution or an affiliate thereof, or against any other person based upon an association of such person with a depository institution.
<br>(d) Activities
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in paragraph (3), and except with respect to insurance sales, solicitation, and cross marketing activities, which shall be governed by paragraph (2), no State may, by statute, regulation, order, interpretation, or other action, prevent or restrict a depository institution or an affiliate thereof from engaging directly or indirectly, either by itself or in conjunction with an affiliate, or any other person, in any activity authorized or permitted under this Act and the amendments made by this Act.
<br>(2) Insurance sales
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>In accordance with the legal standards for preemption set forth in the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in Barnett Bank of Marion County N.A. v. Nelson, 517 U.S. 25 (1996), no State may, by statute, regulation, order, interpretation, or other action, prevent or significantly interfere with the ability of a depository institution, or an affiliate thereof, to engage, directly or indirectly, either by itself or in conjunction with an affiliate or any other person, in any insurance sales, solicitation, or crossmarketing activity.
<br>(B) Certain State laws preserved
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), a State may impose any of the following restrictions, or restrictions that are substantially the same as but no more burdensome or restrictive than those in each of the following clauses:
<br>
<br>(i) Restrictions prohibiting the rejection of an insurance policy by a depository institution or an affiliate of a depository institution, solely because the policy has been issued or underwritten by any person who is not associated with such depository institution or affiliate when the insurance is required in connection with a loan or extension of credit.
<br>
<br>(ii) Restrictions prohibiting a requirement for any debtor, insurer, or insurance agent or broker to pay a separate charge in connection with the handling of insurance that is required in connection with a loan or other extension of credit or the provision of another traditional banking product by a depository institution, or any affiliate of a depository institution, unless such charge would be required when the depository institution or affiliate is the licensed insurance agent or broker providing the insurance.
<br>
<br>(iii) Restrictions prohibiting the use of any advertisement or other insurance promotional material by a depository institution or any affiliate of a depository institution that would cause a reasonable person to believe mistakenly that—
<br>
<br>(I) the Federal Government or a State is responsible for the insurance sales activities of, or stands behind the credit of, the institution or affiliate; or
<br>
<br>(II) a State, or the Federal Government guarantees any returns on insurance products, or is a source of payment on any insurance obligation of or sold by the institution or affiliate;
<br>
<br>(iv) Restrictions prohibiting the payment or receipt of any commission or brokerage fee or other valuable consideration for services as an insurance agent or broker to or by any person, unless such person holds a valid State license regarding the applicable class of insurance at the time at which the services are performed, except that, in this clause, the term "services as an insurance agent or broker" does not include a referral by an unlicensed person of a customer or potential customer to a licensed insurance agent or broker that does not include a discussion of specific insurance policy terms and conditions.
<br>
<br>(v) Restrictions prohibiting any compensation paid to or received by any individual who is not licensed to sell insurance, for the referral of a customer that seeks to purchase, or seeks an opinion or advice on, any insurance product to a person that sells or provides opinions or advice on such product, based on the purchase of insurance by the customer.
<br>
<br>(vi) Restrictions prohibiting the release of the insurance information of a customer (defined as information concerning the premiums, terms, and conditions of insurance coverage, including expiration dates and rates, and insurance claims of a customer contained in the records of the depository institution or an affiliate thereof) to any person other than an officer, director, employee, agent, or affiliate of a depository institution, for the purpose of soliciting or selling insurance, without the express consent of the customer, other than a provision that prohibits—
<br>
<br>(I) a transfer of insurance information to an unaffiliated insurer in connection with transferring insurance in force on existing insureds of the depository institution or an affiliate thereof, or in connection with a merger with or acquisition of an unaffiliated insurer; or
<br>
<br>(II) the release of information as otherwise authorized by State or Federal law.
<br>
<br>(vii) Restrictions prohibiting the use of health information obtained from the insurance records of a customer for any purpose, other than for its activities as a licensed agent or broker, without the express consent of the customer.
<br>
<br>(viii) Restrictions prohibiting the extension of credit or any product or service that is equivalent to an extension of credit, lease or sale of property of any kind, or furnishing of any services or fixing or varying the consideration for any of the foregoing, on the condition or requirement that the customer obtain insurance from a depository institution or an affiliate of a depository institution, or a particular insurer, agent, or broker, other than a prohibition that would prevent any such depository institution or affiliate—
<br>
<br>(I) from engaging in any activity described in this clause that would not violate section 106 of the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970 [12 U.S.C. 1971 et seq.], as interpreted by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; or
<br>
<br>(II) from informing a customer or prospective customer that insurance is required in order to obtain a loan or credit, that loan or credit approval is contingent upon the procurement by the customer of acceptable insurance, or that insurance is available from the depository institution or an affiliate of the depository institution.
<br>
<br>(ix) Restrictions requiring, when an application by a consumer for a loan or other extension of credit from a depository institution is pending, and insurance is offered or sold to the consumer or is required in connection with the loan or extension of credit by the depository institution or any affiliate thereof, that a written disclosure be provided to the consumer or prospective customer indicating that the customer's choice of an insurance provider will not affect the credit decision or credit terms in any way, except that the depository institution may impose reasonable requirements concerning the creditworthiness of the insurer and scope of coverage chosen.
<br>
<br>(x) Restrictions requiring clear and conspicuous disclosure, in writing, where practicable, to the customer prior to the sale of any insurance policy that such policy—
<br>
<br>(I) is not a deposit;
<br>
<br>(II) is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation;
<br>
<br>(III) is not guaranteed by any depository institution or, if appropriate, an affiliate of any such institution or any person soliciting the purchase of or selling insurance on the premises thereof; and
<br>
<br>(IV) where appropriate, involves investment risk, including potential loss of principal.
<br>
<br>(xi) Restrictions requiring that, when a customer obtains insurance (other than credit insurance or flood insurance) and credit from a depository institution, or any affiliate of such institution, or any person soliciting the purchase of or selling insurance on the premises thereof, the credit and insurance transactions be completed through separate documents.
<br>
<br>(xii) Restrictions prohibiting, when a customer obtains insurance (other than credit insurance or flood insurance) and credit from a depository institution or an affiliate of such institution, or any person soliciting the purchase of or selling insurance on the premises thereof, inclusion of the expense of insurance premiums in the primary credit transaction without the express written consent of the customer.
<br>
<br>(xiii) Restrictions requiring maintenance of separate and distinct books and records relating to insurance transactions, including all files relating to and reflecting consumer complaints, and requiring that such insurance books and records be made available to the appropriate State insurance regulator for inspection upon reasonable notice.
<br>(C) Limitations
<br>(i) OCC deference
<br>
<br>Section 6714(e) of this title does not apply with respect to any State statute, regulation, order, interpretation, or other action regarding insurance sales, solicitation, or cross marketing activities described in subparagraph (A) that was issued, adopted, or enacted before September 3, 1998, and that is not described in subparagraph (B).
<br>(ii) Nondiscrimination
<br>
<br>Subsection (e) does not apply with respect to any State statute, regulation, order, interpretation, or other action regarding insurance sales, solicitation, or cross marketing activities described in subparagraph (A) that was issued, adopted, or enacted before September 3, 1998, and that is not described in subparagraph (B).
<br>(iii) Construction
<br>
<br>Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed—
<br>
<br>(I) to limit the applicability of the decision of the Supreme Court in Barnett Bank of Marion County N.A. v. Nelson, 517 U.S. 25 (1996) with respect to any State statute, regulation, order, interpretation, or other action that is not referred to or described in subparagraph (B); or
<br>
<br>(II) to create any inference with respect to any State statute, regulation, order, interpretation, or other action that is not described in this paragraph.
<br>(3) Insurance activities other than sales
<br>
<br>State statutes, regulations, interpretations, orders, and other actions shall not be preempted under paragraph (1) to the extent that they—
<br>
<br>(A) relate to, or are issued, adopted, or enacted for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance in accordance with the Act entitled "An Act to express the intent of Congress with reference to the regulation of the business of insurance" and approved March 9, 1945 (15 U.S.C. 1011 et seq.) (commonly referred to as the "McCarran-Ferguson Act");
<br>
<br>(B) apply only to persons that are not depository institutions, but that are directly engaged in the business of insurance (except that they may apply to depository institutions engaged in providing savings bank life insurance as principal to the extent of regulating such insurance);
<br>
<br>(C) do not relate to or directly or indirectly regulate insurance sales, solicitations, or cross marketing activities; and
<br>
<br>(D) are not prohibited under subsection (e).
<br>(4) Financial activities other than insurance
<br>
<br>No State statute, regulation, order, interpretation, or other action shall be preempted under paragraph (1) to the extent that—
<br>
<br>(A) it does not relate to, and is not issued and adopted, or enacted for the purpose of regulating, directly or indirectly, insurance sales, solicitations, or cross marketing activities covered under paragraph (2);
<br>
<br>(B) it does not relate to, and is not issued and adopted, or enacted for the purpose of regulating, directly or indirectly, the business of insurance activities other than sales, solicitations, or cross marketing activities, covered under paragraph (3);
<br>
<br>(C) it does not relate to securities investigations or enforcement actions referred to in subsection (f); and
<br>
<br>(D) it—
<br>
<br>(i) does not distinguish by its terms between depository institutions, and affiliates thereof, engaged in the activity at issue and other persons engaged in the same activity in a manner that is in any way adverse with respect to the conduct of the activity by any such depository institution or affiliate engaged in the activity at issue;
<br>
<br>(ii) as interpreted or applied, does not have, and will not have, an impact on depository institutions, or affiliates thereof, engaged in the activity at issue, or any person who has an association with any such depository institution or affiliate, that is substantially more adverse than its impact on other persons engaged in the same activity that are not depository institutions or affiliates thereof, or persons who do not have an association with any such depository institution or affiliate;
<br>
<br>(iii) does not effectively prevent a depository institution or affiliate thereof from engaging in activities authorized or permitted by this Act or any other provision of Federal law; and
<br>
<br>(iv) does not conflict with the intent of this Act generally to permit affiliations that are authorized or permitted by Federal law.

<br>(1) distinguishes by its terms between depository institutions, or affiliates thereof, and other persons engaged in such activities, in a manner that is in any way adverse to any such depository institution, or affiliate thereof;
<br>
<br>(2) as interpreted or applied, has or will have an impact on depository institutions, or affiliates thereof, that is substantially more adverse than its impact on other persons providing the same products or services or engaged in the same activities that are not depository institutions, or affiliates thereof, or persons or entities affiliated therewith;
<br>
<br>(3) effectively prevents a depository institution, or affiliate thereof, from engaging in insurance activities authorized or permitted by this Act or any other provision of Federal law; or

<br>"SEC. 101. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
<br>
<br>"(a) Findings.—The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>"(1) the ability of businesses and individuals to obtain property and casualty insurance at reasonable and predictable prices, in order to spread the risk of both routine and catastrophic loss, is critical to economic growth, urban development, and the construction and maintenance of public and private housing, as well as to the promotion of United States exports and foreign trade in an increasingly interconnected world;
<br>
<br>"(2) property and casualty insurance firms are important financial institutions, the products of which allow mutualization of risk and the efficient use of financial resources and enhance the ability of the economy to maintain stability, while responding to a variety of economic, political, environmental, and other risks with a minimum of disruption;
<br>
<br>"(3) the ability of the insurance industry to cover the unprecedented financial risks presented by potential acts of terrorism in the United States can be a major factor in the recovery from terrorist attacks, while maintaining the stability of the economy;
<br>
<br>"(4) widespread financial market uncertainties have arisen following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, including the absence of information from which financial institutions can make statistically valid estimates of the probability and cost of future terrorist events, and therefore the size, funding, and allocation of the risk of loss caused by such acts of terrorism;
<br>
<br>"(5) a decision by property and casualty insurers to deal with such uncertainties, either by terminating property and casualty coverage for losses arising from terrorist events, or by radically escalating premium coverage to compensate for risks of loss that are not readily predictable, could seriously hamper ongoing and planned construction, property acquisition, and other business projects, generate a dramatic increase in rents, and otherwise suppress economic activity; and
<br>
<br>"(6) the United States Government should provide temporary financial compensation to insured parties, contributing to the stabilization of the United States economy in a time of national crisis, while the financial services industry develops the systems, mechanisms, products, and programs necessary to create a viable financial services market for private terrorism risk insurance.
<br>
<br>"(b) Purpose.—The purpose of this title is to establish a temporary Federal program that provides for a transparent system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism, in order to—
<br>
<br>"(1) protect consumers by addressing market disruptions and ensure the continued widespread availability and affordability of property and casualty insurance for terrorism risk; and
<br>
<br>"(2) allow for a transitional period for the private markets to stabilize, resume pricing of such insurance, and build capacity to absorb any future losses, while preserving State insurance regulation and consumer protections.
