<br>(1)(A) From the total amount appropriated for this subsection pursuant to section 4451(a) of this title, funds may be deposited into a trust fund maintained by the Institute at a federally insured banking or savings institution.
<br>
<br>(B) The President of the Institute shall provide—
<br>
<br>(i) for the deposit into the trust fund referred to in subparagraph (A)—
<br>
<br>(I) of a capital contribution by the Institute in an amount equal to the amount of each Federal contribution; and
<br>
<br>(II) any earnings on the funds deposited under this paragraph; or
<br>
<br>(ii) for the reservation for the sole use of the Institute of any noncash, in-kind contributions of real or personal property, which property may at any time be converted to cash, which shall be deposited as a capital contribution into the trust fund referred to in subparagraph (A).
<br>
<br>(C) If at any time the Institute withdraws any capital contribution (as described in subparagraph (B)(i)) made by the Institute to the trust fund referred to in subparagraph (A) or puts any property (as described in subparagraph (B)(ii)) to a use which is not for the sole benefit of the Institute, an amount equal to the value of the Federal contribution shall be withdrawn from such trust fund and returned to the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.
<br>
<br>(2) Interest deposited into the trust fund pursuant to paragraph (1)(B)(ii) may be periodically withdrawn and used, at the direction of the Board or its designee, to defray any expense associated with the operation of the Institute, including the expense of operations and maintenance, administration, academic and support personnel, community and student services programs, and technical assistance.

All funds transferred to the Institute by the Secretary of the Treasury after June 2, 1988, shall be deemed to have been properly transferred as of July 23, 1992.
<br>
<br>(4) Amounts appropriated under section 4451(a) of this title for use under this subsection shall be paid by the Secretary of the Treasury to the Institute as a Federal capital contribution equal to the amount of funds or the value of the in-kind contributions which the Institute demonstrates have been placed within the control of, or irrevocably committed to the use of, the Institute as a capital contribution of the Institute in accordance with this subsection.
<br>(b) Capital improvement endowment
<br>
<br>(1) In addition to the trust fund established under subsection (a), funds may be deposited into a trust fund maintained by the Institute at a federally insured banking or savings institution from the amount reserved for this subsection pursuant to section 4451(a) of this title for the purpose of establishing a separate special endowment for capital improvement (hereafter in this subsection referred to as the "capital endowment fund") to pay expenses associated with site selection and preparation, site planning and architectural design and planning, new construction, materials and equipment procurement, renovation, alteration, repair, and other building and expansion costs of the Institute.

If at any time the Institute withdraws any capital contribution to the capital endowment fund before the funds have been deposited for this two-year period, an equal amount of the Federal contribution shall be withdrawn from the capital endowment fund and returned to the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. At the end of the two-year period, the entire principal and interest of the funds deposited for this period, including the Federal matching portion, shall accrue, without reservation, to the Institute and may be withdrawn, in whole or in part, to defray expenses associated with capital acquisition and improvement of the Institute referred to in paragraph (1).
<br>
<br>(4) For the purpose of complying with the contribution requirement of paragraph (2), the Institute may use funds which are available from any private, non-Federal governmental, or tribal source.
<br>
<br>(5) Subject to paragraph (3), amounts appropriated under section 4451(a) of this title for use under this subsection shall be paid by the Secretary of the Treasury to the Institute as a Federal capital contribution equal to the amount which the Institute demonstrates has been placed within the control of, or irrevocably committed to the use of, the Institute and is available for deposit as a capital contribution of the Institute in accordance with this subsection.
<br>
<br>(6) For the purpose of complying with the contribution requirement in this subsection, the Institute may use funds or in-kind contributions of real or personal property. For the purposes of this paragraph, all contributions, in-kind and real estate, which are held by the Institute beginning on November 29, 1990, and which were received after June 2, 1988, but which have not been included in their entirety in computations under this section shall be eligible for matching Federal funds appropriated in any year.
<br>(c) General administrative provisions
<br>
<br>(1) Funds in the trust funds described in subsections (a) and (b) shall be invested under the same conditions and limitations as funds are invested under section 1065(c)(2) of this title and the regulations implementing such section (as such regulations were in effect at the time the funds are invested).
<br>
<br>(2) No part of the net earnings of the trust funds established under this section shall inure to the benefit of any private person.
<br>
<br>(3) Any amounts deposited in a trust fund authorized under subsection (a) may be used to secure loans procured for the purposes of constructing or improving Institute facilities.

<br>§4510. James Madison Memorial Fellowship Trust Fund
<br>(a) Establishment
<br>
<br>There shall be established in the Treasury of the United States a trust fund consisting of appropriations and amounts contributed by the Foundation for the Commemoration of the Constitution and other private sources to be available, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, to carry out the provisions of this chapter.
<br>(b) Investment of amounts appropriated
<br>
<br>(1) At the request of the Trust Fund, it shall be the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury to invest in full the amounts appropriated and contributed to the fund. Such investments may be made only in interest-bearing obligations of the United States issued directly to the fund.
<br>
<br>(2) The purposes for which obligations of the United States may be issued under chapter 31 of title 31 are hereby extended to authorize the issuance at par of special obligations directly to the fund. Such special obligations shall bear interest at a rate equal to the average rate of interest, computed as to the end of the calendar month next preceding the date of such issue, borne by all marketable interest-bearing obligations of the United States then forming a part of the public debt; except that where such average rate is not a multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum, the rate of interest of such special obligations shall be the multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum next lower than such average rate. All requests of the Trust Fund to the Secretary of the Treasury provided for in this section shall be binding upon the Secretary.
<br>(c) Sale of obligations acquired by fund
<br>
<br>At the request of the Trust Fund, the Secretary of the Treasury shall redeem any obligation issued directly to the fund. Obligations issued to the fund under subsection (b)(2) shall be redeemed at par plus accrued interest. Any other obligations issued directly to the fund shall be redeemed at the market price.
<br>(d) Interest and proceeds from sale or redemption of obligations credited to fund
<br>
<br>The interest on, and the proceeds from, the sale or redemption of any obligations held in the fund shall be credited to and form a part of the fund.

<br>
<br>2003—Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 108–7, §126(1), added heading and text of subsec. (b) and struck out former subsec. (b) which read as follows: "It shall be the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury to invest in full the amounts appropriated and contributed to the fund. Such investments may be made only in interest-bearing obligations of the United States or in obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States. For such purpose, such obligations may be acquired (1) on original issue at the issue price, or (2) by purchase of outstanding obligations at the market price. The purposes for which obligations of the United States may be issued under the Second Liberty Bond Act, as amended, are hereby extended to authorize the issuance at par of special obligations exclusively to the fund. Such special obligations shall bear interest at a rate equal to the average rate of interest, computed as to the end of the calendar month next preceding the date of such issue, borne by all marketable interest-bearing obligations of the United States then forming a part of the public debt; except that where such average rate is not a multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum, the rate of interest of such special obligations shall be the multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum next lower than such average rate.

The recipient university shall from sources other than that portion of the endowment funded herein furnish the office, classroom and related services suitable to such a member of the faculty.
<br>
<br>The professor holding each chair shall file a copy of such articles with the Library of Congress, which shall make them available to libraries in the usual manner and the recipient of the endowment shall also make a copy available upon request by accredited educational institutions, bar associations, and general news media without royalty or charge other than the costs associated with printing or reprinting, handling and distribution.

If a grantee university elects to discontinue such chair and support services, the corpus of the endowment attributable to the Federal grant shall revert to the Treasury of the United States.
<br>(e) Application for grant of endowment
<br>
<br>The application for the grant for an endowment shall require only such information and supporting material as is reasonably necessary to assure that the funds will be used for the purposes described herein.
