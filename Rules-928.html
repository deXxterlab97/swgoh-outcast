<br>
<br>(aa) the cost or value of materials under subclause (I) of clause (i), and
<br>
<br>(bb) the direct costs of processing operations under subclause (II) of clause (i),
<br>

<br>
<br>In any 1-year period after the initial applicable 1-year period, the requirements under clause (i) relating to applicable percentage may also be met for articles of a producer or an entity controlling production that enter during the 1-year period by aggregating—
<br>
<br>(aa) the cost or value of materials under subclause (I) of clause (i), and
<br>
<br>(bb) the direct costs of processing operations under subclause (II) of clause (i),
<br>

<br>If U.S. Customs and Border Protection finds that a producer or an entity controlling production has not satisfied such requirements in the initial applicable 1-year period or any 1-year period thereafter, either for individual entries entered pursuant to clause (i) or for entries entered in aggregate pursuant to clause (iv), then apparel articles described in clause (i) of that producer or entity shall be ineligible for preferential treatment under paragraph (1) during any succeeding 1-year period until—
<br>
<br>(aa) the cost or value of materials under subclause (I) of clause (i), plus
<br>

<br>
<br>If—

<br>
<br>(bb) that producer or entity controlling production satisfies the requirements of subclause (II) of this clause in that 1-year period,
<br>
<br>then, notwithstanding section 1514 of this title or any other provision of law, upon proper request filed with U.S. Customs and Border Protection before the 90th day after U.S. Customs and Border Protection determines that item (bb) applies, the entry of any articles—
<br>

<br>
<br>(BB) with respect to which there would have been preferential treatment under subparagraph (A) if the producer or entity controlling production had satisfied the requirements in clause (i) or (iv) (as the case may be),
<br>
<br>shall be liquidated or reliquidated as though such preferential treatment under subparagraph (A) applied to such entry.

<br>
<br>For purposes of determining the applicable percentage under clause (i) or (iv), there may be included in that percentage—
