<br>12	Let no man despise thy youth: but be thou an example of the faithful in word, in conversa- tion, in charity, in faith, in chastity.
<br>13	Till I come, attend unto reading, to exhor- tation, and to doctrine.
<br>14	Neglect not the grace that is in thee, which was given thee by prophesy, with imposition of the hands of the priesthood.
<br>15	Meditate upon these things, be wholly in these things: that thy profiting may be manifest to all.
<br>16	Take heed to thyself and to doctrine: be earnest in them. For in doing this thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee.
<br>
<br>Chapter 5
<br>
<br>An ancient man rebuke not, but entreat him as a father: young men, as brethren:
<br>2	Old women, as mothers: young women, as sisters, in all chastity.
<br>3	Honour widows, that are widows indeed.
<br>4	But if any widow have children, or grandchil- dren, let her learn first to govern her own house, and to make a return of duty to her parents: for this is acceptable before God.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>5	But she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, let her trust in God, and continue in supplica- tions and prayers night and day.
<br>6	For she that liveth in pleasures, is dead while she is living.
<br>7	And this give in charge, that they may be blameless.
<br>8	But if any man have not care of his own, and especially of those of his house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.
<br>9	Let a widow be chosen of no less than three- score years of age, who hath been the wife of one husband.
<br>10	Having testimony for her good works, if she have brought up children, if she have received to harbour, if she have washed the saints’ feet, if she have ministered to them that suffer tribulation, if she have diligently followed every good work. 11 But the younger widows avoid. For when they have grown wanton in Christ, they will
<br>marry:
<br>12	Having damnation, because they have made void their first faith.
<br>13	And withal being idle they learn to go about from house to house: and are not only idle, but tattlers also, and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.
<br>14	I will therefore that the younger should marry, bear children, be mistresses of families, give no occasion to the adversary to speak evil. 15 For some are already turned aside after Sa-
<br>tan.
<br>16	If any of the faithful have widows, let him minister to them, and let not the church be charged: that there may be sufficient for them that are widows indeed.
<br>17	Let the priests that rule well, be esteemed worthy of double honour: especially they who labour in the word and doctrine:
<br> 
<br>18	For the scripture saith: Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn: and, The labourer is worthy of his reward.
<br>19	Against a priest receive not an accusation, but under two or three witnesses.
<br>20	Them that sin reprove before all: that the rest also may have fear.
<br>21	I charge thee before God, and Christ Je- sus, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing by de- clining to either side.
<br>22	Impose not hands lightly upon any man, neither be partaker of other men’s sins. Keep thyself chaste.
<br>23	Do not still drink water, but use a little wine for thy stomach’s sake, and thy frequent infirmities.
<br>24	Some men’s sins are manifest, going before to judgment: and some men they follow after.
<br>25	In like manner also good deeds are mani- fest: and they that are otherwise, cannot be hid.
<br>
<br>Chapter 6
<br>
<br>Whosoever are servants under the yoke, let them count their masters worthy of all honour; lest the name of the Lord and his doctrine be blas- phemed.
<br>2	But they that   have   believing   masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but serve them the rather, because they are faithful and beloved, who are partakers of the benefit.  These things teach and exhort.
<br>3	If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to that doctrine which is according to godliness,
<br>4	He is proud, knowing nothing, but sick about questions and strifes of words; from which
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>arise envies, contentions, blasphemies, evil sus- picions,
<br>5	Conflicts of men corrupted in mind, and who are destitute of the truth, supposing gain to be godliness.
<br>6	But godliness with contentment is great gain.
<br>7	For we brought nothing into this world: and certainly we can carry nothing out.
<br>8	But having food, and wherewith to be cov- ered, with these we are content.
<br>9	For they that will become rich, fall into temptation, and into the snare of the devil, and into many unprofitable and hurtful desires, which drown men into destruction and perdition. 10 For the desire of money is the root of all evils; which some coveting have erred from the faith, and have entangled themselves in many
<br>sorrows.
<br>11	But thou, O man of God, fly these things: and pursue justice, godliness, faith, charity, pa- tience, mildness.
<br>12	Fight the good fight of faith: lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art called, and hast confessed a good confession before many wit- nesses.
<br>13	I charge thee before God, who quickeneth all things, and before Christ Jesus, who gave tes- timony under Pontius Pilate, a good confession, 14 That thou keep the commandment without spot, blameless, unto the coming of our Lord Je-
<br>sus Christ,
<br>15	Which in his times he shall shew who is the Blessed and only Mighty, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;
<br>16	Who only hath immortality, and inhabiteth light inaccessible, whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and empire ever- lasting. Amen.
<br> 
<br>17	Charge the rich of this world not to be high- minded, nor to trust in the uncertainty of riches, but in the living God, (who giveth us abundantly all things to enjoy,)
<br>18	To do good, to be rich in good works, to give easily, to communicate to others,
<br>19	To lay up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on the true life.
<br>20	O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding the profane novelties of words, and oppositions of knowledge falsely so called.
<br>21	Which some promising, have erred concern- ing the faith. Grace be with thee. Amen.

<br>The Second Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>
<br>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, according to the promise of life, which is in Christ Jesus.
<br>2	To Timothy my dearly beloved son, grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from Christ Jesus our Lord.
<br>3	I give thanks to God, whom I serve from my forefathers with a pure conscience, that with- out ceasing, I have a remembrance of thee in my prayers, night and day.
<br>4	Desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy,
<br>5	Calling to mind that faith which is in thee unfeigned, which also dwelt first in thy grand- mother Lois, and in thy mother Eunice, and I am certain that in thee also.
<br>6	For which cause I admonish thee, that thou stir up the grace of God which is in thee, by the imposition of my hands.
<br>7	For God hath not given us the spirit of fear: but of power, and of love, and of sobriety.
<br>8	Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testi- mony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but labour with the gospel, according to the power of God,
<br>9	Who hath delivered us and called us by his holy calling, not according to our works, but ac-
<br> 
<br>cording to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the times of the world.
<br>10	But is now made manifest by the illumina- tion of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath de- stroyed death, and hath brought to light life and incorruption by the gospel:
<br>11	Wherein I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and teacher of the Gentiles.
<br>12	For which cause I also suffer these things: but I am not ashamed. For I know whom I have believed, and I am certain that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him, against that day.
<br>13	Hold the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me in faith, and in the love which is in Christ Jesus.
<br>14	Keep the good thing committed to thy trust by the Holy Ghost, who dwelleth in us.
<br>15	Thou knowest this, that all they who are in Asia, are turned away from me: of whom are Phigellus and Hermogenes.
<br>16	The Lord give mercy to the house of One- siphorus: because he hath often refreshed me, and hath not been ashamed of my chain:
<br>17	But when he was come to Rome, he care- fully sought me, and found me.
<br>18	The Lord grant unto him to find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou very well knowest.
<br>
<br>Chapter 2
<br>
<br>Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace which is in Christ Jesus:
<br>2	And the things which thou hast heard of me by many witnesses, the same commend to faithful men, who shall be fit to teach others also.
<br>3	Labour as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.
<br>4	No man, being a soldier to God, entan- gleth himself with secular businesses; that he may please him to whom he hath engaged him- self.
<br>5	For he also that striveth for the mastery, is not crowned, except he strive lawfully.
<br>6	The husbandman, that laboureth, must first partake of the fruits.
<br>7	Understand what I say: for the Lord will give thee in all things understanding.
<br>8	Be mindful that the Lord Jesus Christ is risen again from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my gospel.
<br>9	Wherein I labour even unto bands, as an evildoer; but the word of God is not bound.
<br>10	Therefore I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the sal- vation, which is in Christ Jesus, with heavenly glory.
<br>11	A faithful saying: for if we be dead with him, we shall live also with him.
<br>12	If we suffer, we shall also reign with him.
<br>If we deny him, he will also deny us.
<br>13	If we believe not, he continueth faithful, he can not deny himself.
<br>14	Of these things put them in mind, charging them before the Lord. Contend not in words, for
<br> 
<br>it is to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.
<br>15	Carefully study to present thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth.
<br>16	But shun profane and vain babblings: for they grow much towards ungodliness.
<br>17	And their speech spreadeth like a canker: of whom are Hymeneus and Philetus:
<br>18	Who have erred from the truth, saying, that the resurrection is past already, and have subverted the faith of some.
<br>19	But the sure foundation of God standeth firm, having this seal: the Lord knoweth who are his; and let every one depart from iniquity who nameth the name of the Lord.
<br>20	But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and earth: and some indeed unto honour, but some unto dishonour.
<br>21	If any man therefore shall cleanse himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified and profitable to the Lord, prepared unto every good work.
<br>22	But flee thou youthful desires, and pursue justice, faith, charity, and peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.
<br>23	And avoid foolish and unlearned questions, knowing that they beget strifes.
<br>24	But the servant of the Lord must not wran- gle: but be mild towards all men, apt to teach, patient,
<br>25	With modesty admonishing them that re- sist the truth: if peradventure God may give them repentance to know the truth,
<br>26	And they may recover themselves from the snares of the devil, by whom they are held cap- tive at his will.
<br> 
<br>
<br>The Second Epistle of St.  Paul to Timothy	1533
<br> 
<br>
<br>Chapter 3
<br>
<br>Know also this, that, in the last days, shall come dangerous times.
<br>2	Men shall be lovers of themselves, cov- etous, haughty, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, wicked,
<br>3	Without affection, without peace, slander- ers, incontinent, unmerciful, without kindness,
<br>4	Traitors, stubborn, puffed up, and lovers of pleasures more than of God:
<br>5	Having an appearance indeed of godliness, but denying the power thereof. Now these avoid. 6 For of these sort are they who creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with
<br>sins, who are led away with divers desires:
<br>7	Ever learning, and never attaining to the knowledge of the truth.
<br>8	Now as Jannes and Mambres resisted Moses, so these also resist the truth, men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith.
<br>9	But they shall proceed no farther; for their folly shall be manifest to all men, as theirs also was.
<br>10	But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, patience,
<br>11	Persecutions, afflictions: such as came upon me at Antioch, at Iconium, and at Lystra: what persecutions I endured, and out of them all the Lord delivered me.
<br>12	And all that will live godly in Christ Jesus, shall suffer persecution.
<br>13	But evil men and seducers shall grow worse and worse: erring, and driving into error.
<br>14	But continue thou in those things which thou hast learned, and which have been commit- ted to thee: knowing of whom thou hast learned them;
<br> 
<br>
<br>15	And because from thy infancy thou hast known the holy scriptures, which can instruct thee to salvation, by the faith which is in Christ Jesus.
<br>16	All scripture, inspired of God, is profitable to teach, to reprove, to correct, to instruct in justice,
<br>17	That the man of God may be perfect, fur- nished to every good work.
<br>
<br>Chapter 4
<br>I charge thee, before God and Jesus Christ, who shall judge the living and the dead, by his com- ing, and his kingdom:
<br>2	Preach the word: be instant in season, out of season: reprove, entreat, rebuke in all patience and doctrine.
<br>3	For there shall be a time, when they will not endure sound doctrine; but, according to their own desires, they will heap to themselves teach- ers, having itching ears:
<br>4	And will indeed turn away their hearing from the truth, but will be turned unto fables.
<br>5	But be thou vigilant, labour in all things, do the work of an evangelist, fulfil thy ministry. Be sober.
<br>6	For I am even now ready to be sacrificed: and the time of my dissolution is at hand.
<br>7	I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith.
<br>8	As to the rest, there is laid up for me a crown of justice, which the Lord the just judge will render to me in that day: and not only to me, but to them also that love his coming. Make haste to come to me quickly.
<br>9	For Demas hath left me, loving this world, and is gone to Thessalonica:
<br>10	Crescens into Galatia, Titus into Dalmatia.
<br> 
<br>
<br>11	Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.
<br>12	But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.
<br>13	The cloak that I left at Troas, with Car- pus, when thou comest, bring with thee, and the books, especially the parchments.
<br>14	Alexander the coppersmith hath done me much evil: the Lord will reward him according to his works:
<br>15	Whom do thou also avoid, for he hath greatly withstood our words.
<br>16	At my first answer no man stood with me, but all forsook me: may it not be laid to their charge.
<br>17	But the Lord stood by me, and strength- ened me, that by me the preaching may be ac- complished, and that all the Gentiles may hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion. 18 The Lord hath delivered me from every evil work: and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom, to whom be glory for ever and ever.
<br>Amen.
<br>19	Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the house- hold of Onesiphorus.
<br>20	Erastus remained at Corinth.  And Trophimus I left sick at Miletus.
<br>21	Make haste to come before winter Eubulus and Pudens, and Linus and Claudia, and all the brethren, salute thee.
<br>22	The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit.
<br>Grace be with you. Amen.

<br>The Epistle of St. Paul to Titus
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>
<br>Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Je- sus Christ, according to the faith of the elect of God and the acknowledging of the truth, which is according to godliness:
<br>2	Unto the hope of life everlasting, which God, who lieth not, hath promised before the times of the world:
<br>3	But hath in due times manifested his word in preaching, which is committed to me according to the commandment of God our Savior:
<br>4	To Titus my beloved son, according to the common faith, grace and peace from God the Father, and from Christ Jesus our Savior.
<br>5	For this cause I left thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are want- ing, and shouldest ordain priests in every city, as I also appointed thee:
<br>6	If any be without crime, the husband of one wife, having faithful children, not accused of riot, or unruly.
<br>7	For a bishop must be without crime, as the steward of God: not proud, not subject to anger, not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre:
<br>8	But given to hospitality, gentle, sober, just, holy, continent:
<br>9	Embracing that faithful word which is ac- cording to doctrine, that he may be able to ex- hort in sound doctrine, and to convince the gain-
<br> 
<br>sayers.
<br>10	For there are also many disobedient, vain talkers, and seducers: especially they who are of the circumcision:
<br>11	Who must be reproved, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake.
<br>12	One of them a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are always liars, evil beasts, sloth- ful bellies.
<br>13	This testimony is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;
<br>14	Not giving heed to Jewish fables and com- mandments of men, who turn themselves away from the truth.
<br>15	All things are clean to the clean: but to them that are defiled, and to unbelievers, noth- ing is clean: but both their mind and their con- science are defiled.
<br>16	They profess that they know God: but in their works they deny him; being abominable, and incredulous, and to every good work repro- bate.
<br>
<br>Chapter 2
<br>But speak thou the things that become sound doctrine:
<br>2 That the aged men be sober, chaste, pru- dent, sound in faith, in love, in patience.
<br> 
<br>
<br>1536	The Epistle of St. Paul to Titus
<br>
<br> 
<br>3	The aged women, in like manner, in holy attire, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teaching well:
<br>4	That they may teach the young women to be wise, to love their husbands, to love their chil- dren,
<br>5	To be discreet, chaste, sober, having a care of the house, gentle, obedient to their husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.
<br>6	Young men, in like manner, exhort that they be sober.
<br>7	In all things shew thyself an example of good works, in doctrine, in integrity, in gravity,
<br>8	The sound word that can not be blamed: that he, who is on the contrary part, may be afraid, having no evil to say of us.
<br>9	Exhort servants to be obedient to their mas- ters, in all things pleasing, not gainsaying:
<br>10	Not defrauding, but in all things shewing good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things:
<br>11	For the grace of God our Savior hath ap- peared to all men;
<br>12	Instructing us, that, denying ungodliness and worldly desires, we should live soberly, and justly, and godly in this world,
<br>13	Looking for the blessed hope and coming of the glory of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ,
<br>14	Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and might cleanse to himself a people acceptable, a pursuer of good works.
<br>15	These things speak, and exhort and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 3
<br>Admonish them to be subject to princes and powers, to obey at a word, to be ready to ev- ery good work.
<br>2 To speak evil of no man, not to be litigious, but gentle: shewing all mildness towards all men. 3 For we ourselves also were some time unwise, incredulous, erring, slaves to divers desires and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and
<br>hating one another.
<br>4	But when the goodness and kindness of God our Savior appeared:
<br>5	Not by the works of justice, which we have done, but according to his mercy, he saved us, by the laver of regeneration, and renovation of the Holy Ghost;
<br>6	Whom he hath poured forth upon us abun- dantly, through Jesus Christ our Savior:
<br>7	That, being justified by his grace, we may be heirs, according to hope of life everlasting.
<br>8	It is a faithful saying: and these things I will have thee affirm constantly: that they, who be- lieve in God, may be careful to excel in good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.
<br>9	But avoid foolish questions, and genealo- gies, and contentions, and strivings about the law. For they are unprofitable and vain.
<br>10	A man that is a heretic, after the first and second admonition, avoid:
<br>11	Knowing that he, that is such an one, is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned by his own judgment.
<br>12	When I shall send to thee Artemas or Ty- chicus, make haste to come unto me to Nicopolis. For there I have determined to winter.
<br>13	Send forward Zenas, the lawyer, and Apollo, with care, that nothing be wanting to them.
<br> 
<br>
<br>The Epistle of St.  Paul to Titus	1537
<br>14	And let our men also learn to excel in good works for necessary uses: that they be not un- fruitful.

<br>The Epistle of St. Paul to Philemon
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>
<br>Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy, a brother: to Philemon, our beloved and fellow labourer;
<br>2	And to Appia, our dearest sister, and to Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to the church which is in thy house:
<br>3	Grace to you and peace from God our Fa- ther, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
<br>4	I give thanks to my God, always making a remembrance of thee in my prayers.
<br>5	Hearing of thy charity and faith, which thou hast in the Lord Jesus, and towards all the saints: 6 That the communication of thy faith may be made evident in the acknowledgment of every
<br>good work, that is in you in Christ Jesus.
<br>7	For I have had great joy and consolation in thy charity, because the bowels of the saints have been refreshed by thee, brother.
<br>8	Wherefore though I have much confidence in Christ Jesus, to command thee that which is to the purpose:
<br>9	For charity sake I rather beseech, whereas thou art such a one, as Paul an old man, and now a prisoner also of Jesus Christ.
<br>10	I beseech thee for my son, whom I have begotten in my bands, Onesimus,
<br>11	Who hath been heretofore unprofitable to thee, but now is profitable both to me and thee, 12 Whom I have sent back to thee. And do
<br> 
<br>thou receive him as my own bowels.
<br>13	Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered to me in the bands of the gospel:
<br>14	But without thy counsel I would do noth- ing: that thy good deed might not be as it were of necessity, but voluntary.
<br>15	For perhaps he therefore departed for a sea- son from thee, that thou mightest receive him again for ever:
<br>16	Not now as a servant, but instead of a ser- vant, a most dear brother, especially to me: but how much more to thee both in the flesh and in the Lord?
<br>17	If therefore thou count me a partner, re- ceive him as myself.
<br>18	And if he hath wronged thee in any thing, or is in thy debt, put that to my account.
<br>19	I Paul have written it with my own hand: I will repay it: not to say to thee, that thou owest me thy own self also.
<br>20	Yea, brother. May I enjoy thee in the Lord.
<br>Refresh my bowels in the Lord.
<br>21	Trusting in thy obedience, I have written to thee: knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.
<br>22	But withal prepare me also a lodging. For I hope that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.
<br>23	There salute thee Epaphras, my fellow pris- oner in Christ Jesus;
<br> 
<br>

<br>The Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews
<br>
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>God, who, at sundry times and in divers man- ners, spoke in times past to the fathers by the prophets, last of all,
<br>2	In these days hath spoken to us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the world.
<br>3	Who being the brightness of his glory, and the figure of his substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, making pur- gation of sins, sitteth on the right hand of the majesty on high.
<br>4	Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath inherited a more excellent name than they.
<br>5	For to which of the angels hath he said at any time, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?
<br>6	And again, when he bringeth in the first begotten into the world, he saith: And let all the angels of God adore him.
<br>7	And to the angels indeed he saith: He that maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.
<br>8	But to the Son: Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of justice is the sceptre of thy kingdom.
<br>9	Thou hast loved justice, and hated iniquity:
<br> 
<br>therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
<br>10	And: Thou in the beginning, O Lord, didst found the earth: and the works of thy hands are the heavens.
<br>11	They shall perish, but thou shalt continue: and they shall all grow old as a garment.
<br>12	And as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: but thou art the self- same, and thy years shall not fail.
<br>13	But to which of the angels said he at any time: Sit on my right hand, until I make thy enemies thy footstool?
<br>14	Are they not all ministering spirits, sent to minister for them, who shall receive the inheri- tance of salvation?
<br>
<br>Chapter 2
<br>Therefore ought we more diligently to observe the things which we have heard, lest perhaps we should let them slip.
<br>2	For if the word, spoken by angels, became steadfast, and every transgression and disobedi- ence received a just recompense of reward:
<br>3	How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation? which having begun to be declared by the Lord, was confirmed unto us by them that heard him.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>4	God also bearing them witness by signs, and wonders, and divers miracles, and distributions of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will.
<br>5	For God hath not subjected unto angels the world to come, whereof we speak.
<br>6	But one in a certain place hath testified, saying: What is man, that thou art mindful of him: or the son of man, that thou visitest him? 7 Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels: thou hast crowned him with glory and honour, and hast set him over the works of thy
<br>hands:
<br>8 Thou hast subjected all things under his feet. For in that he hath subjected all things to him, he left nothing not subject to him. But now we see not as yet all things subject to him. 9 But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour: that, through
<br>the grace of God, he might taste death for all.
<br>10	For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, who had brought many children into glory, to perfect the author of their salvation, by his passion.
<br>11	For both he that sanctifieth, and they who are sanctified, are all of one. For which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, saying:
<br>12	I will declare thy name to my brethren; in the midst of the church will I praise thee.
<br>13	And again: I will put my trust in him. And again: Behold I and my children, whom God hath given me.
<br>14	Therefore because the children are partak- ers of flesh and blood, he also himself in like manner hath been partaker of the same: that, through death, he might destroy him who had the empire of death, that is to say, the devil:
<br>15	And might deliver them, who through the fear of death were all their lifetime subject to servitude.
<br> 
<br>16	For no where doth he take hold of the an- gels: but of the seed of Abraham he taketh hold. 17 Wherefore it behoved him in all things to be made like unto his brethren, that he might become a merciful and faithful priest before God, that he might be a propitiation for the sins of the
<br>people.
<br>18 For in that, wherein he himself hath suf- fered and been tempted, he is able to succour them also that are tempted.
<br>
<br>Chapter 3
<br>Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heav- enly vocation, consider the apostle and high priest of our confession, Jesus:
<br>2	Who is faithful to him that made him, as was also Moses in all his house.
<br>3	For this man was counted worthy of greater glory than Moses, by so much as he that hath built the house, hath greater honour than the house.
<br>4	For every house is built by some man: but he that created all things, is God.
<br>5	And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be said:
<br>6	But Christ as the Son in his own house: which house are we, if we hold fast the confi- dence and glory of hope unto the end.
<br>7	Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost saith: To day if you shall hear his voice,
<br>8	Harden not your hearts, as in the provoca- tion; in the day of temptation in the desert,
<br>9	Where your fathers tempted me, proved and saw my works,
<br>10	Forty years: for which cause I was offended with this generation, and I said: They always err in heart. And they have not known my ways,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>11	As I have sworn in my wrath: If they shall enter into my rest.
<br>12	Take heed, brethren, lest perhaps there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, to depart from the living God.
<br>13	But exhort one another every day, whilst it is called to day, that none of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.
<br>14	For we are made partakers of Christ: yet so, if we hold the beginning of his substance firm unto the end.
<br>15	While it is said, To day if you shall hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in that provo- cation.
<br>16	For some who heard did provoke: but not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.
<br>17	And with whom was he offended forty years? Was it not with them that sinned, whose carcasses were overthrown in the desert?
<br>18	And to whom did he swear, that they should not enter into his rest: but to them that were incredulous?
<br>19	And we see that they could not enter in, because of unbelief.
<br>
<br>Chapter 4
<br>Let us fear therefore lest the promise being left of entering into his rest, any of you should be thought to be wanting.
<br>2	For unto us also it hath been declared, in like manner as unto them. But the word of hearing did not profit them, not being mixed with faith of those things they heard.
<br>3	For we, who have believed, shall enter into rest; as he said: As I have sworn in my wrath; If they shall enter into my rest; and this indeed when the works from the foundation of the world were finished.
<br> 
<br>4	For in a certain place he spoke of the seventh day thus: And God rested the seventh day from all his works.
<br>5	And in this place again: If they shall enter into my rest.
<br>6	Seeing then it remaineth that some are to enter into it, and they, to whom it was first preached, did not enter because of unbelief:
<br>7	Again he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time, as it is above said: To day if you shall hear his voice, harden not your hearts.
<br>8	For if Jesus had given them rest, he would never have afterwards spoken of another day.
<br>9	There remaineth therefore a day of rest for the people of God.
<br>10	For he that is entered into his rest, the same also hath rested from his works, as God did from his.
<br>11	Let us hasten therefore to enter into that rest; lest any man fall into the same example of unbelief.
<br>12	For the word of God is living and effectual, and more piercing than any two edged sword; and reaching unto the division of the soul and the spirit, of the joints also and the marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.
<br>13	Neither is there any creature invisible in his sight: but all things are naked and open to his eyes, to whom our speech is.
<br>14	Having therefore a great high priest that hath passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God: let us hold fast our confession.
<br>15	For we have not a high priest, who can not have compassion on our infirmities: but one tempted in all things like as we are, without sin. 16 Let us go therefore with confidence to the throne of grace: that we may obtain mercy, and
<br>find grace in seasonable aid.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 5
<br>For every high priest taken from among men, is ordained for men in the things that appertain to God, that he may offer up gifts and sacrifices for sins:
<br>2	Who can have compassion on them that are ignorant and that err: because he himself also is compassed with infirmity.
<br>3	And therefore he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.
<br>4	Neither doth any man take the honour to himself, but he that is called by God, as Aaron was.
<br>5	So Christ also did not glorify himself, that he might be made a high priest: but he that said unto him: Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.
<br>6	As he saith also in another place: Thou art a priest for ever, according to the order of Melchisedech.
<br>7	Who in the days of his flesh, with a strong cry and tears, offering up prayers and suppli- cations to him that was able to save him from death, was heard for his reverence.
<br>8	And whereas indeed he was the Son of God, he learned obedience by the things which he suf- fered:
<br>9	And being consummated, he became, to all that obey him, the cause of eternal salvation.
<br>10	Called by God a high priest according to the order of Melchisedech.
<br>11	Of whom we have much to say, and hard to be intelligibly uttered: because you are become weak to hear.
<br>12	For whereas for the time you ought to be masters, you have need to be taught again what are the first elements of the words of God: and you are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.
<br> 
<br>13	For every one that is a partaker of milk, is unskillful in the word of justice: for he is a little child.
<br>14	But strong meat is for the perfect; for them who by custom have their senses exercised to the discerning of good and evil.
<br>
<br>Chapter 6
<br>Wherefore leaving the word of the beginning of Christ, let us go on to things more perfect, not laying again the foundation of penance from dead works, and of faith towards God,
<br>2	Of the doctrine of baptisms, and imposition of hands, and of the resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.
<br>3	And this will we do, if God permit.
<br>4	For it is impossible for those who were once illuminated, have tasted also the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,
<br>5	Have moreover tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,
<br>6	And are fallen away: to be renewed again to penance, crucifying again to themselves the Son of God, and making him a mockery.
<br>7	For the earth that drinketh in the rain which cometh often upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is tilled, receiveth blessing from God.
<br>8	But that which bringeth forth thorns and briers, is reprobate, and very near unto a curse, whose end is to be burnt.
<br>9	But, my dearly beloved, we trust better things of you, and nearer to salvation; though we speak thus.
<br>10	For God is not unjust, that he should forget your work, and the love which you have shewn in his name, you who have ministered, and do minister to the saints.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>11	And we desire that every one of you shew forth the same carefulness to the accomplishing of hope unto the end:
<br>12	That you become not slothful, but followers of them, who through faith and patience shall inherit the promises.
<br>13	For God making promise to Abraham, be- cause he had no one greater by whom he might swear, swore by himself,
<br>14	Saying: Unless blessing I shall bless thee, and multiplying I shall multiply thee.
<br>15	And so patiently enduring he obtained the promise.
<br>16	For men swear by one greater than them- selves: and an oath for confirmation is the end of all their controversy.
<br>17	Wherein God, meaning more abundantly to shew to the heirs of the promise the im- mutability of his counsel, interposed an oath:
<br>18	That by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have the strongest comfort, who have fled for refuge to hold fast the hope set before us.
<br>19	Which we have as an anchor of the soul, sure and firm, and which entereth in even within the veil;
<br>20	Where the forerunner Jesus is entered for us, made a high priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedech.
<br>
<br>Chapter 7
<br>For this Melchisedech was king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham return- ing from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him:
<br>2 To whom also Abraham divided the tithes of all: who first indeed by interpretation, is king of justice: and then also king of Salem, that is,
<br> 
<br>king of peace:
<br>3	Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but likened unto the Son of God, con- tinueth a priest for ever.
<br>4	Now consider how great this man is, to whom also Abraham the patriarch gave tithes out of the principal things.
<br>5	And indeed they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the priesthood, have a command- ment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is to say, of their brethren: though they themselves also came out of the loins of Abraham.
<br>6	But he, whose pedigree is not numbered among them, received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.
<br>7	And without all contradiction, that which is less, is blessed by the better.
<br>8	And here indeed, men that die, receive thithes: but there he hath witness, that he liveth.
<br>9	And (as it may be said) even Levi who re- ceived tithes, paid tithes in Abraham:
<br>10	For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedech met him.
<br>11	If then perfection was by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that an- other priest should rise according to the order of Melchisedech, and not be called according to the order of Aaron?
<br>12	For the priesthood being translated, it is necessary that a translation also be made of the law.
<br>13	For he, of whom these things are spoken, is of another tribe, of which no one attended on the altar.
<br>14	For it is evident that our Lord sprung out of Juda: in which tribe Moses spoke nothing con-
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>cerning priests.
<br>15	And it is yet far more evident: if according to the similitude of Melchisedech there ariseth another priest,
<br>16	Who is made not according to the law of a carnal commandment, but according to the power of an indissoluble life:
<br>17	For he testifieth: Thou art a priest for ever, according to the order of Melchisedech.
<br>18	There is indeed a setting aside of the for- mer commandment, because of the weakness and unprofitableness thereof:
<br>19	(For the law brought nothing to perfec- tion,) but a bringing in of a better hope, by which we draw nigh to God.
<br>20	And inasmuch as it is not without an oath, (for the others indeed were made priests without an oath;
<br>21	But this with an oath, by him that said unto him: The Lord hath sworn, and he will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever.)
<br>22	By so much is Jesus made a surety of a better testament.
<br>23	And the others indeed were made many priests, because by reason of death they were not suffered to continue:
<br>24	But this, for that he continueth for ever, hath an everlasting priesthood,
<br>25	Whereby he is able also to save for ever them that come to God by him; always living to make intercession for us.
<br>26	For it was fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, sepa- rated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;
<br>27	Who needeth not daily (as the other priests) to offer sacrifices first for his own sins, and then for the people’s: for this he did once, in offering himself.
<br> 
<br>28	For the law maketh men priests, who have infirmity: but the word of the oath, which was since the law, the Son who is perfected for ever- more.
<br>
<br>Chapter 8
<br>Now of the things which we have spoken, this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of majesty in the heavens,
<br>2	A minister of the holies, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord hath pitched, and not man.
<br>3	For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is necessary that he also should have some thing to offer.
<br>4	If then he were on earth, he would not be a priest: seeing that there would be others to offer gifts according to the law,
<br>5	Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things. As it was answered to Moses, when he was to finish the tabernacle: See (saith he) that thou make all things according to the pattern which was shewn thee on the mount.
<br>6	But now he hath obtained a better ministry, by how much also he is a mediator of a better tes- tament, which is established on better promises. 7 For if that former had been faultless, there should not indeed a place have been sought for
<br>a second.
<br>8	For finding fault with them, he saith: Be- hold, the days shall come, saith the Lord: and I will perfect unto the house of Israel, and unto the house of Juda, a new testament:
<br>9	Not according to the testament which I made to their fathers, on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt: because they continued not in my tes-
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>tament: and I regarded them not, saith the Lord. 10 For this is the testament which I will make to the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord: I will give my laws into their mind, and in their heart will I write them: and I will be their
<br>God, and they shall be my people:
<br>11	And they shall not teach every man his neighbour and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me from the least to the greatest of them:
<br>12	Because I will be merciful to their iniqui- ties, and their sins I will remember no more.
<br>13	Now in saying a new, he hath made the for- mer old. And that which decayeth and groweth old, is near its end.
<br>
<br>Chapter 9
<br>The former indeed had also justifications of di- vine service, and a worldly sanctuary.
<br>2	For there was a tabernacle made the first, wherein were the candlesticks, and the table, and the setting forth of loaves, which is called the holy.
<br>3	And after the second veil, the tabernacle, which is called the holy of holies:
<br>4	Having a golden censer, and the ark of the testament covered about on every part with gold, in which was a golden pot that had manna, and the rod of Aaron, that had blossomed, and the tables of the testament.
<br>5	And over it were the cherubims of glory over- shadowing the propitiatory: of which it is not needful to speak now particularly.
<br>6	Now these things being thus ordered, into the first tabernacle the priests indeed always en- tered, accomplishing the offices of sacrifices.
<br>7	But into the second, the high priest alone, once a year: not without blood, which he offereth
<br> 
<br>for his own, and the people’s ignorance:
<br>8	The Holy Ghost signifying this, that the way into the holies was not yet made manifest, whilst the former tabernacle was yet standing.
<br>9	Which is a parable of the time present: ac- cording to which gifts and sacrifices are offered, which can not, as to the conscience, make him perfect that serveth, only in meats and in drinks, 10 And divers washings, and justices of the
<br>flesh laid on them until the time of correction.
<br>11	But Christ, being come an high priest of the good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hand, that is, not of this creation:
<br>12	Neither by the blood of goats, or of calves, but by his own blood, entered once into the holies, having obtained eternal redemption.
<br>13	For if the blood of goats and of oxen, and the ashes of an heifer being sprinkled, sanctify such as are defiled, to the cleansing of the flesh: 14 How much more shall the blood of Christ, who by the Holy Ghost offered himself unspot- ted unto God, cleanse our conscience from dead
<br>works, to serve the living God?
<br>15	And therefore he is the mediator of the new testament: that by means of his death, for the redemption of those trangressions, which were under the former testament, they that are called may receive the promise of eternal inheritance.
<br>16	For where there is a testament, the death of the testator must of necessity come in.
<br>17	For a testament is of force, after men are dead: otherwise it is as yet of no strength, whilst the testator liveth.
<br>18	Whereupon neither was the first indeed dedicated without blood.
<br>19	For when every commandment of the law had been read by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,
<br>20	Saying: This is the blood of the testament, which God hath enjoined unto you.
<br>21	The tabernacle also and all the vessels of the ministry, in like manner, he sprinkled with blood.
<br>22	And almost all things, according to the law, are cleansed with blood: and without shedding of blood there is no remission.
<br>23	It is necessary therefore that the patterns of heavenly things should be cleansed with these: but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.
<br>24	For Jesus is not entered into the holies made with hands, the patterns of the true: but into heaven itself, that he may appear now in the presence of God for us.
<br>25	Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holies, every year with the blood of others:
<br>26	For then he ought to have suffered often from the beginning of the world: but now once at the end of ages, he hath appeared for the de- struction of sin, by the sacrifice of himself.
<br>27	And as it is appointed unto men once to die, and after this the judgment:
<br>28	So also Christ was offered once to exhaust the sins of many; the second time he shall ap- pear without sin to them that expect him unto salvation.
<br>
<br>Chapter 10
<br>For the law having a shadow of the good things to come, not the very image of the things; by the selfsame sacrifices which they offer continually every year, can never make the comers thereunto perfect:
<br> 
<br>2	For then they would have ceased to be of- fered: because the worshippers once cleansed should have no conscience of sin any longer:
<br>3	But in them there is made a commemoration of sins every year.
<br>4	For it is impossible that with the blood of oxen and goats sin should be taken away.
<br>5	Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith: Sacrifice and oblation thou wouldest not: but a body thou hast fitted to me:
<br>6	Holocausts for sin did not please thee.
<br>7	Then said I: Behold I come: in the head of the book it is written of me: that I should do thy will, O God.
<br>8	In saying before, Sacrifices, and oblations, and holocausts for sin thou wouldest not, nei- ther are they pleasing to thee, which are offered according to the law.
<br>9	Then said I: Behold, I come to do thy will, O God: he taketh away the first, that he may establish that which followeth.
<br>10	In the which will, we are sanctified by the oblation of the body of Jesus Christ once.
<br>11	And every priest indeed standeth daily ministering, and often offering the same sacri- fices, which can never take away sins.
<br>12	But this man offering one sacrifice for sins, for ever sitteth on the right hand of God,
<br>13	From henceforth expecting, until his ene- mies be made his footstool.
<br>14	For by one oblation he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.
<br>15	And the Holy Ghost also doth testify this to us. For after that he said:
<br>16	And this is the testament which I will make unto them after those days, saith the Lord. I will give my laws in their hearts, and on their minds will I write them:
<br>17	And their sins and iniquities I will remem- ber no more.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>18	Now where there is a remission of these, there is no more an oblation for sin.
<br>19	Having therefore, brethren, a confidence in the entering into the holies by the blood of Christ;
<br>20	A new and living way which he hath ded- icated for us through the veil, that is to say, his flesh,
<br>21	And a high priest over the house of God:
<br>22	Let us draw near with a true heart in ful- ness of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with clean water.
<br>23	Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering (for he is faithful that hath promised),
<br>24	And let us consider one another, to provoke unto charity and to good works:
<br>25	Not forsaking our assembly, as some are accustomed; but comforting one another, and so much the more as you see the day approaching.
<br>26	For if we sin wilfully after having the knowledge of the truth, there is now left no sac- rifice for sins,
<br>27	But a certain dreadful expectation of judg- ment, and the rage of a fire which shall consume the adversaries.
<br>28	A man making void the law of Moses, dieth without any mercy under two or three witnesses:
<br>29	How much more, do you think he de- serveth worse punishments, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath esteemed the blood of the testament unclean, by which he was sanctified, and hath offered an affront to the Spirit of grace?
<br>30	For we know him that hath said: Vengeance belongeth to me, and I will repay. And again: The Lord shall judge his people.
<br>31	It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
<br> 
<br>32	But call to mind the former days, wherein, being illuminated, you endured a great fight of afflictions.
<br>33	And on the one hand indeed, by reproaches and tribulations, were made a gazingstock; and on the other, became companions of them that were used in such sort.
<br>34	For you both had compassion on them that were in bands, and took with joy the be- ing stripped of your own goods, knowing that you have a better and a lasting substance.
<br>35	Do not therefore lose your confidence, which hath a great reward.
<br>36	For patience is necessary for you; that, do- ing the will of God, you may receive the promise. 37 For yet a little and a very little while, and he that is to come, will come, and will not delay. 38 But my just man liveth by faith; but if he
<br>withdraw himself, he shall not please my soul.
<br>39 But we are not the children of withdrawing unto perdition, but of faith to the saving of the soul.
<br>
<br>Chapter 11
<br>Now faith is the substance of things to be hoped for, the evidence of things that appear not.
<br>2	For by this the ancients obtained a testi- mony.
<br>3	By faith we understand that the world was framed by the word of God; that from invisible things visible things might be made.
<br>4	By faith Abel offered to God a sacrifice ex- ceeding that of Cain, by which he obtained a tes- timony that he was just, God giving testimony to his gifts; and by it he being dead yet speaketh.
<br>5	By faith Henoch was translated, that he should not see death; and he was not found, be- cause God had translated him: for before his
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>translation he had testimony that he pleased God.
<br>6	But without faith it is impossible to please God. For he that cometh to God, must believe that he is, and is a rewarder to them that seek him.
<br>7	By faith Noe, having received an answer con- cerning those things which as yet were not seen, moved with fear, framed the ark for the saving of his house, by the which he condemned the world; and was instituted heir of the justice which is by faith.
<br>8	By faith he that is called Abraham, obeyed to go out into a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.
<br>9	By faith he abode in the land, dwelling in cottages, with Isaac and Jacob, the co-heirs of the same promise.
<br>10	For he looked for a city that hath founda- tions; whose builder and maker is God.
<br>11	By faith also Sara herself, being barren, received strength to conceive seed, even past the time of age; because she believed that he was faithful who had promised,
<br>12	For which cause there sprung even from one (and him as good as dead) as the stars of heaven in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.
<br>13	All these died according to faith, not hav- ing received the promises, but beholding them afar off, and saluting them, and confessing that they are pilgrims and strangers on the earth.
<br>14	For they that say these things, do signify that they seek a country.
<br>15	And truly if they had been mindful of that from whence they came out, they had doubtless time to return.
<br>16	But now they desire a better, that is to say, a heavenly country. Therefore God is not
<br> 
<br>ashamed to be called their God; for he hath pre- pared for them a city.
<br>17	By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered Isaac: and he that had received the promises, offered up his only begotten son;
<br>18	(To whom it was said: In Isaac shall thy seed be called.)
<br>19	Accounting that God is able to raise up even from the dead. Whereupon also he received him for a parable.
<br>20	By faith also of things to come, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau.
<br>21	By faith Jacob dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and adored the top of his rod.
<br>22	By faith Joseph, when he was dying, made mention of the going out of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.
<br>23	By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months by his parents; because they saw he was a comely babe, and they feared not the king’s edict.
<br>24	By faith Moses, when he was grown up, de- nied himself to be the son of Pharao’s daughter; 25 Rather choosing to be afflicted with the people of God, than to have the pleasure of sin
<br>for a time,
<br>26	Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasure of the Egyptians. For he looked unto the reward.
<br>27	By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the fierceness of the king: for he endured as seeing him that is invisible.
<br>28	By faith he celebrated the pasch, and the shedding of the blood; that he, who destroyed the firstborn, might not touch them.
<br>29	By faith they passed through the Red Sea, as by dry land: which the Egyptians attempting, were swallowed up.
<br>30	By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, by the going round them seven days.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>31	By faith Rahab the harlot perished not with the unbelievers, receiving the spies with peace.
<br>32	And what shall I yet say? For the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, Barac, Samson, Jephthe, David, Samuel, and the prophets:
<br>33	Who by faith conquered kingdoms, wrought justice, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,
<br>34	Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, recovered strength from weak- ness, became valiant in battle, put to flight the armies of foreigners:
<br>35	Women received their dead raised to life again. But others were racked, not accepting deliverance, that they might find a better resur- rection.
<br>36	And others had trial of mockeries and stripes, moreover also of bands and prisons.
<br>37	They were stoned, they were cut asunder, they were tempted, they were put to death by the sword, they wandered about in sheepskins, in goatskins, being in want, distressed, afflicted: 38 Of whom the world was not worthy; wan- dering in deserts, in mountains, and in dens, and
<br>in caved of the earth.
<br>39	And all these being approved by the testi- mony of faith, received not the promise;
<br>40	God providing some better thing for us, that they should not be perfected without us.
<br>
<br>Chapter 12
<br>And therefore we also having so great a cloud of witnesses over our head, laying aside every weight and sin which surrounds us, let us run by patience to the fight proposed to us:
<br>2 Looking on Jesus, the author and finisher of faith, who having joy set before him, endured
<br> 
<br>the cross, despising the shame, and now sitteth on the right hand of the throne of God.
<br>3 For think diligently upon him that endured such opposition from sinners against himself; that you be not wearied, fainting in your minds. 4 For you have not yet resisted unto blood,
<br>striving against sin:
<br>5	And you have forgotten the consolation, which speaketh to you, as unto children, saying: My son, neglect not the discipline of the Lord; neither be thou wearied whilst thou art rebuked by him.
<br>6	For whom the Lord loveth, he chastiseth; and he scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.
<br>7	Persevere under discipline. God dealeth with you as with his sons; for what son is there, whom the father doth not correct?
<br>8	But if you be without chastisement, whereof all are made partakers, then are you bastards, and not sons.
<br>9	Moreover we have had fathers of our flesh, for instructors, and we reverenced them: shall we not much more obey the Father of spirits, and live?
<br>10	And they indeed for a few days, according to their own pleasure, instructed us: but he, for our profit, that we might receive his sanctifica- tion.
<br>11	Now all chastisement for the present in- deed seemeth not to bring with it joy, but sor- row: but afterwards it will yield, to them that are exercised by it, the most peaceable fruit of justice.
<br>12	Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees,
<br>13	And make straight steps with your feet: that no one, halting, may go out of the way; but rather be healed.
<br>14	Follow peace with all men, and holiness: without which no man shall see God.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>15	Looking diligently, lest any man be want- ing to the grace of God; lest any root of bitter- ness springing up do hinder, and by it many be defiled.
<br>16	Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau; who for one mess, sold his first birthright.
<br>17	For know ye that afterwards, when he de- sired to inherit the benediction, he was rejected; for he found no place of repentance, although with tears he had sought it.
<br>18	For you are not come to a mountain that might be touched, and a burning fire, and a whirlwind, and darkness, and storm,
<br>19	And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words, which they that heard excused them- selves, that the word might not be spoken to them:
<br>20	For they did not endure that which was said: And if so much as a beast shall touch the mount, it shall be stoned.
<br>21	And so terrible was that which was seen, Moses said: I am frighted, and tremble.
<br>22	But you are come to mount Sion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to the company of many thousands of angels, 23 And to the church of the firstborn, who are written in the heavens, and to God the judge of
<br>all, and to the spirits of the just made perfect,
<br>24	And to Jesus the mediator of the new tes- tament, and to the sprinkling of blood which speaketh better than that of Abel.
<br>25	See that you refuse him not that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spoke upon the earth, much more shall not we, that turn away from him that speaketh to us from heaven.
<br>26	Whose voice then moved the earth; but now he promiseth, saying: Yet once more, and I will move not only the earth, but heaven also.
<br> 
<br>27	And in that he saith, Yet once more, he signifieth the translation of the moveable things as made, that those things may remain which are immoveable.
<br>28	Therefore receiving an immoveable king- dom, we have grace; whereby let us serve, pleas- ing God, with fear and reverence.
<br>29	For our God is a consuming fire.
<br>
<br>Chapter 13
<br>Let the charity of the brotherhood abide in you. 2 And hospitality do not forget; for by this some, being not aware of  it, have entertained
<br>angels.
<br>3	Remember them that are in bands, as if you were bound with them; and them that labour, as being yourselves also in the body.
<br>4	Marriage honourable in all, and the bed un- defiled. For fornicators and adulterers God will judge.
<br>5	Let your manners be without covetousness, contented with such things as you have; for he hath said: I will not leave thee, neither will I forsake thee.
<br>6	So that we may confidently say: The Lord is my helper: I will not fear what man shall do to me.
<br>7	Remember your prelates who have spoken the word of God to you; whose faith follow, con- sidering the end of their conversation,
<br>8	Jesus Christ, yesterday, and to day; and the same for ever.
<br>9	Be not led away with various and strange doctrines. For it is best that the heart be estab- lished with grace, not with meats; which have not profited those that walk in them.
<br>10	We have an altar, whereof they have no power to eat who serve the tabernacle.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>11	For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the holies by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.
<br>12	Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanc- tify the people by his own blood, suffered with- out the gate.
<br>13	Let us go forth therefore to him without the camp, bearing his reproach.
<br>14	For we have not here a lasting city, but we seek one that is to come.
<br>15	By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise always to God, that is to say, the fruit of lips confessing to his name.
<br>16	And do not forget to do good, and to im- part; for by such sacrifices God’s favour is ob- tained.
<br>17	Obey your prelates, and be subject to them. For they watch as being to render an ac- count of your souls; that they may do this with joy, and not with grief. For this is not expedient for you.
<br>18	Pray for us. For we trust we have a good conscience, being willing to behave ourselves well in all things.
<br>19	And I beseech you the more to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.
<br>20	And may the God of peace, who brought again from the dead the great pastor of the sheep, our Lord Jesus Christ, in the blood of the everlasting testament,
<br>21	Fit you in all goodness, that you may do his will; doing in you that which is well pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom is glory for ever and ever. Amen.
<br>22	And I beseech you, brethren, that you suf- fer this word of consolation. For I have written to you in a few words.
<br>23	Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty: with whom (if he come shortly) I will see you.
<br> 
<br>24	Salute all your prelates, and all the saints.
<br>The brethren from Italy salute you.
<br>25	Grace be with you all. Amen.

<br>The Catholic Epistle of St. James the Apostle
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>James the servant of God, and of our Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.
<br>2	My brethren, count it all joy, when you shall fall into divers temptations;
<br>3	Knowing that the trying of your faith wor- keth patience.
<br>4	And patience hath a perfect work; that you may be perfect and entire, failing in nothing.
<br>5	But if any of you want wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men abundantly, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.
<br>6	But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea, which is moved and carried about by the wind.
<br>7	Therefore let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.
<br>8	A double minded man is inconstant in all his ways.
<br>9	But let the brother of low condition glory in his exaltation:
<br>10	And the rich, in his being low; because as the flower of the grass shall he pass away.
<br>11	For the sun rose with a burning heat, and parched the grass, and the flower thereof fell off, and the beauty of the shape thereof perished: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.
<br> 
<br>12	Blessed is the man that endureth temp- tation; for when he hath been proved, he shall receive a crown of life, which God hath promised to them that love him.
<br>13	Let no man, when he is tempted, say that he is tempted by God. For God is not a tempter of evils, and he tempteth no man.
<br>14	But every man is tempted by his own con- cupiscence, being drawn away and allured.
<br>15	Then when concupiscence hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin. But sin, when it is com- pleted, begetteth death.
<br>16	Do not err, therefore, my dearest brethren. 17 Every best gift, and every perfect gift, is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no change, nor shadow
<br>of alteration.
<br>18	For of his own will hath he begotten us by the word of truth, that we might be some beginning of his creatures.
<br>19	You know, my dearest brethren. And let every man be swift to hear, but slow to speak, and slow to anger.
<br>20	For the anger of man worketh not the jus- tice of God.
<br>21	Wherefore casting away all uncleanness, and abundance of naughtiness, with meekness receive the ingrafted word, which is able to save your souls.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>22	But be ye doers of the word, and not hear- ers only, deceiving your own selves.
<br>23	For if a man be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he shall be compared to a man be- holding his own countenance in a glass.
<br>24	For he beheld himself, and went his way, and presently forgot what manner of man he was. 25 But he that hath looked into the perfect law of liberty, and hath continued therein, not becoming a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the
<br>work; this man shall be blessed in his deed.
<br>26	And if any man think himself to be reli- gious, not bridling his tongue, but deceiving his own heart, this man’s religion is vain.
<br>27	Religion clean and undefiled before God and the Father, is this: to visit the fatherless and widows in their tribulation: and to keep one’s self unspotted from this world.
<br>
<br>Chapter 2
<br>My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory with respect of persons.
<br>2	For if there shall come into your assembly a man having a golden ring, in fine apparel, and there shall come in also a poor man in mean attire,
<br>3	And you have respect to him that is clothed with the fine apparel, and shall say to him: Sit thou here well; but say to the poor man: Stand thou there, or sit under my footstool:
<br>4	Do you not judge within yourselves, and are become judges of unjust thoughts?
<br>5	Hearken, my dearest brethren: hath not God chosen the poor in this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which God hath promised to them that love him?
<br>6	But you have dishonoured the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you by might? and do not
<br> 
<br>they draw you before the judgment seats?
<br>7	Do not they blaspheme the good name that is invoked upon you?
<br>8	If then you fulfil the royal law, according to the scriptures, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself; you do well.
<br>9	But if you have respect to persons, you com- mit sin, being reproved by the law as transgres- sors.
<br>10	And whosoever shall keep the whole law, but offend in one point, is become guilty of all.
<br>11	For he that said, Thou shalt not commit adultery, said also, Thou shalt not kill. Now if thou do not commit adultery, but shalt kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.
<br>12	So speak ye, and so do, as being to be judged by the law of liberty.
<br>13	For judgment without mercy to him that hath not done mercy. And mercy exalteth itself above judgment.
<br>14	What shall it profit, my brethren, if a man say he hath faith, but hath not works? Shall faith be able to save him?
<br>15	And if a brother or sister be naked, and want daily food:
<br>16	And one of you say to them: Go in peace, be ye warmed and filled; yet give them not those things that are necessary for the body, what shall it profit?
<br>17	So faith also, if it have not works, is dead in itself.
<br>18	But some man will say: Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without works; and I will shew thee, by works, my faith. 19 Thou believest that there is one God. Thou
<br>dost well: the devils also believe and tremble.
<br>20	But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?
<br>21	Was not Abraham our father justified by works, offering up Isaac his son upon the altar?
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>22	Seest thou, that faith did co-operate with his works; and by works faith was made perfect?
<br>23	And the scripture was fulfilled, saying: Abraham believed God, and it was reputed to him to justice, and he was called the friend of God.
<br>24	Do you see that by works a man is justified; and not by faith only?
<br>25	And in like manner also Rahab the har- lot, was not she justified by works, receiving the messengers, and sending them out another way? 26 For even as the body without the spirit is
<br>dead; so also faith without works is dead.
<br>
<br>Chapter 3
<br>Be ye not many masters, my brethren, knowing that you receive the greater judgment.
<br>2	For in many things we all offend. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man. He is able also with a bridle to lead about the whole body.
<br>3	For if we put bits into the mouths of horses, that they may obey us, and we turn about their whole body.
<br>4	Behold also ships, whereas they are great, and are driven by strong winds, yet are they turned about with a small helm, whithersoever the force of the governor willeth.
<br>5	Even so the tongue is indeed a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold how small a fire kindleth a great wood.
<br>6	And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity. The tongue is placed among our members, which defileth the whole body, and inflameth the wheel of our nativity, being set on fire by hell.
<br>7	For every nature of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of the rest, is tamed, and hath been tamed, by the nature of man:
<br> 
<br>8	But the tongue no man can tame, an unquiet evil, full of deadly poison.
<br>9	By it we bless God and the Father: and by it we curse men, who are made after the likeness of God.
<br>10	Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.
<br>11	Doth a fountain send forth, out of the same hole, sweet and bitter water?
<br>12	Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear grapes; or the vine, figs? So neither can the salt water yield sweet.
<br>13	Who is a wise man, and endued with knowledge among you? Let him shew, by a good conversation, his work in the meekness of wis- dom.
<br>14	But if you have bitter zeal, and there be contentions in your hearts; glory not, and be not liars against the truth.
<br>15	For this is not wisdom, descending from above: but earthly, sensual, devilish.
<br>16	For where envying and contention is, there is inconstancy, and every evil work.
<br>17	But the wisdom, that is from above, first indeed is chaste, then peaceable, modest, easy to be persuaded, consenting to the good, full of mercy and good fruits, without judging, without dissimulation.
<br>18	And the fruit of justice is sown in peace, to them that make peace.
<br>
<br>Chapter 4
<br>From whence are wars and contentions among you? Are they not hence, from your concupis- cences, which war in your members?
<br>2 You covet, and have not: you kill, and envy, and can not obtain. You contend and war, and
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>you have not, because you ask not.
<br>3	You ask, and receive not; because you ask amiss: that you may consume it on your concu- piscences.
<br>4	Adulterers, know you not that the friendship of this world is the enemy of God? Whosoever therefore will be a friend of this world, becometh an enemy of God.
<br>5	Or do you think that the scripture saith in vain: To envy doth the spirit covet which dwelleth in you?
<br>6	But he giveth greater grace. Wherefore he saith: God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.
<br>7	Be subject therefore to God, but resist the devil, and he will fly from you.
<br>8	Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners: and purify your hearts, ye double minded.
<br>9	Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned into mourning, and your joy into sorrow.
<br>10	Be humbled in the sight of the Lord, and he will exalt you.
<br>11	Detract not one another, my brethren. He that detracteth his brother, or he that judgeth his brother, detracteth the law, and judgeth the law. But if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.
<br>12	There is one lawgiver, and judge, that is able to destroy and to deliver.
<br>13	But who art thou that judgest thy neigh- bour? Behold, now you that say: To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and there we will spend a year, and will traffic, and make our gain.
<br>14	Whereas you know not what shall be on the morrow.
<br>15	For what is your life? It is a vapour which appeareth for a little while, and afterwards shall
<br> 
<br>vanish away. For that you should say: If the Lord will, and if we shall live, we will do this or that.
<br>16	But now you rejoice in your arrogancies.
<br>All such rejoicing is wicked.
<br>17	To him therefore who knoweth to do good, and doth it not, to him it is sin.
<br>
<br>Chapter 5
<br>
<br>Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl in your miseries, which shall come upon you.
<br>2	Your riches are corrupted: and your gar- ments are motheaten.
<br>3	Your gold and silver is cankered: and the rust of them shall be for a testimony against you, and shall eat your flesh like fire. You have stored up to yourselves wrath against the last days.
<br>4	Behold the hire of the labourers, who have reaped down your fields, which by fraud has been kept back by you, crieth: and the cry of them hath entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth. 5 You have feasted upon earth: and in riotous- ness you have nourished your hearts, in the day
<br>of slaughter.
<br>6	You have condemned and put to death the Just One, and he resisted you not.
<br>7	Be patient therefore, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth: pa- tiently bearing till he receive the early and latter rain.
<br>8	Be you therefore also patient, and strengthen your hearts: for the coming of the Lord is at hand.
<br>9	Grudge not, brethren, one against another, that you may not be judged. Behold the judge standeth before the door.
<br> 
<br>
<br>10	Take, my brethren, for an example of suf- fering evil, of labour and patience, the prophets, who spoke in the name of the Lord.
<br>11	Behold, we account them blessed who have endured. You have heard of the patience of Job, and you have seen the end of the Lord, that the Lord is merciful and compassionate.
<br>12	But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, nor by the earth, nor by any other oath. But let your speech be, yea, yea: no, no: that you fall not under judgment.
<br>13	Is any of you sad? Let him pray. Is he cheerful in mind? Let him sing.
<br>14	Is any man sick among you? Let him bring in the priests of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.
<br>15	And the prayer of faith shall save the sick man: and the Lord shall raise him up: and if he be in sins, they shall be forgiven him.
<br>16	Confess therefore your sins one to another: and pray one for another, that you may be saved. For the continual prayer of a just man availeth much.
<br>17	Elias was a man passible like unto us: and with prayer he prayed that it might not rain upon the earth, and it rained not for three years and six months.
<br>18	And he prayed again: and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.
<br>19	My brethren, if any of you err from the truth, and one convert him:
<br>20	He must know that he who causeth a sin- ner to be converted from the error of his way, shall save his soul from death, and shall cover a multitude of sins.

<br>The First Epistle of St. Peter the Apostle
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>
<br>Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers dispersed through Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, elect,
<br>2 According to the foreknowledge of God the Father, unto the sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you and peace be multiplied. 3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his great mercy hath regenerated us unto a lively hope, by the
<br>resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
<br>4	Unto an inheritance incorruptible, and un- defiled, and that can not fade, reserved in heaven for you,
<br>5	Who, by the power of God, are kept by faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time.
<br>6	Wherein you shall greatly rejoice, if now you must be for a little time made sorrowful in divers temptations:
<br>7	That the trial of your faith (much more pre- cious than gold which is tried by the fire) may be found unto praise and glory and honour at the appearing of Jesus Christ:
<br>8	Whom having not seen, you love: in whom also now, though you see him not, you believe: and believing shall rejoice with joy unspeakable
<br> 
<br>and glorified;
<br>9	Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.
<br>10	Of which salvation the prophets have in- quired and diligently searched, who prophesied of the grace to come in you.
<br>11	Searching what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ in them did signify: when it foretold those sufferings that are in Christ, and the glories that should follow:
<br>12	To whom it was revealed, that not to them- selves, but to you they ministered those things which are now declared to you by them that have preached the gospel to you, the Holy Ghost be- ing sent down from heaven, on whom the angels desire to look.
<br>13	Wherefore having the loins of your mind girt up, being sober, trust perfectly in the grace which is offered you in the revelation of Jesus Christ,
<br>14	As children of obedience, not fashioned ac- cording to the former desires of your ignorance: 15 But according to him that hath called you, who is holy, be you also in all manner of conver-
<br>sation holy:
<br>16	Because it is written: You shall be holy, for I am holy.
<br>17	And if you invoke as Father him who, with- out respect of persons, judgeth according to ev-
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>ery one’s work: converse in fear during the time of your sojourning here.
<br>18	Knowing that you were not redeemed with corruptible things as gold or silver, from your vain conversation of the tradition of your fathers: 19 But with the precious blood of Christ, as
<br>of a lamb unspotted and undefiled,
<br>20	Foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world, but manifested in the last times for you,
<br>21	Who through him are faithful in God, who raised him up from the dead, and hath given him glory, that your faith and hope might be in God. 22 Purifying your souls in the obedience of charity, with a brotherly love, from a sincere
<br>heart love one another earnestly:
<br>23	Being born again not of corruptible seed, but incorruptible, by the word of God who liveth and remaineth for ever.
<br>24	For all flesh is as grass; and all the glory thereof as the flower of grass. The grass is with- ered, and the flower thereof is fallen away.
<br>25	But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel hath been preached unto you.
<br>
<br>Chapter 2
<br>Wherefore laying away all malice, and all guile, and dissimulations, and envies, and all detrac- tions,
<br>2	As newborn babes, desire the rational milk without guile, that thereby you may grow unto salvation:
<br>3	If so be you have tasted that the Lord is sweet.
<br>4	Unto whom coming, as to a living stone, rejected indeed by men, but chosen and made honourable by God:
<br> 
<br>5	Be you also as living stones built up, a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.
<br>6	Wherefore it is said in the scripture: Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious. And he that shall believe in him, shall not be confounded.
<br>7	To you therefore that believe, he is honour: but to them that believe not, the stone which the builders rejected, the same is made the head of the corner:
<br>8	And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of scan- dal, to them who stumble at the word, neither do believe, whereunto also they are set.
<br>9	But you are a chosen generation, a kingly priesthood, a holy nation, a purchased people: that you may declare his virtues, who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:
<br>10	Who in time past were not a people: but are now the people of God. Who had not ob- tained mercy; but now have obtained mercy.
<br>11	Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, to refrain yourselves from carnal desires which war against the soul,
<br>12	Having your conversation good among the Gentiles: that whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may, by the good works, which they shall behold in you, glorify God in the day of visitation.
<br>13	Be ye subject therefore to every human creature for God’s sake: whether it be to the king as excelling;
<br>14	Or to governors as sent by him for the pun- ishment of evildoers, and for the praise of the good:
<br>15	For so is the will of God, that by doing well you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>16	As free, and not as making liberty a cloak for malice, but as the servants of God.
<br>17	Honour all men.   Love the brotherhood.
<br>Fear God. Honour the king.
<br>18	Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.
<br>19	For this is thankworthy, if for conscience towards God, a man endure sorrows, suffering wrongfully.
<br>20	For what glory is it, if committing sin, and being buffeted for it, you endure? But if doing well you suffer patiently; this is thankworthy be- fore God.
<br>21	For unto this are you called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving you an example that you should follow his steps.
<br>22	Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth.
<br>23	Who, when he was reviled, did not revile: when he suffered, he threatened not: but deliv- ered himself to him that judged him unjustly.
<br>24	Who his own self bore our sins in his body upon the tree: that we, being dead to sins, should live to justice: by whose stripes you were healed.
<br>25	For you were as sheep going astray; but you are now converted to the shepherd and bishop of your souls.
<br>
<br>Chapter 3
<br>In like manner also let wives be subject to their husbands: that if any believe not the word, they may be won without the word, by the conversa- tion of the wives.
<br>2	Considering your chaste conversation with fear.
<br>3	Whose adorning let it not be the outward
<br> 
<br>plaiting of the hair, or the wearing of gold, or the putting on of apparel:
<br>4	But the hidden man of the heart in the in- corruptibility of a quiet and a meek spirit, which is rich in the sight of God.
<br>5	For after this manner heretofore the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned them- selves, being in subjection to their own hus- bands:
<br>6	As Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters you are, doing well, and not fearing any disturbance.
<br>7	Ye husbands, likewise dwelling with them according to knowledge, giving honour to the fe- male as to the weaker vessel, and as to the co- heirs of the grace of life: that your prayers be not hindered.
<br>8	And in fine, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, being lovers of the brotherhood, merciful, modest, humble:
<br>9	Not rendering evil for evil, nor railing for railing, but contrariwise, blessing: for unto this are you called, that you may inherit a blessing.
<br>10	For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile.
<br>11	Let him decline from evil, and do good: let him seek after peace and pursue it:
<br>12	Because the eyes of the Lord are upon the just, and his ears unto their prayers: but the countenance of the Lord upon them that do evil things.
<br>13	And who is he that can hurt you, if you be zealous of good?
<br>14	But if also you suffer any thing for justice’ sake, blessed are ye. And be not afraid of their fear, and be not troubled.
<br>15	But sanctify the Lord Christ in your hearts, being ready always to satisfy every one that as- keth you a reason of that hope which is in you.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>16	But with modesty and fear, having a good conscience: that whereas they speak evil of you, they may be ashamed who falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.
<br>17	For it is better doing well (if such be the will of God) to suffer, than doing ill.
<br>18	Because Christ also died once for our sins, the just for the unjust: that he might offer us to God, being put to death indeed in the flesh, but enlivened in the spirit,
<br>19	In which also coming he preached to those spirits that were in prison:
<br>20	Which had been some time incredulous, when they waited for the patience of God in the days of Noe, when the ark was a building: wherein a few, that is, eight souls, were saved by water.
<br>21	Whereunto baptism being of the like form, now saveth you also: not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the examination of a good conscience towards God by the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
<br>22	Who is on the right hand of God, swallow- ing down death, that we might be made heirs of life everlasting: being gone into heaven, the an- gels and powers and virtues being made subject to him.
<br>
<br>Chapter 4
<br>Christ therefore having suffered in the flesh, be you also armed with the same thought: for he that hath suffered in the flesh, hath ceased from sins:
<br>2	That now he may live the rest of his time in the flesh , not after the desires of men, but according to the will of God.
<br>3	For the time past is sufficient to have ful- filled the will of the Gentiles, for them who have
<br> 
<br>walked in riotousness, lusts, excess of wine, rev- ellings, banquetings, and unlawful worshipping of idols.
<br>4	Wherein they think it strange, that you run not with them into the same confusion of riotous- ness, speaking evil of you.
<br>5	Who shall render account to him, who is ready to judge the living and the dead.
<br>6	For, for this cause was the gospel preached also to the dead: that they might be judged in- deed according to men, in the flesh; but may live according to God, in the Spirit.
<br>7	But the end of all is at hand. Be prudent therefore, and watch in prayers.
<br>8	But before all things have a constant mutual charity among yourselves: for charity covereth a multitude of sins.
<br>9	Using hospitality one towards another, with- out murmuring,
<br>10	As every man hath received grace, minis- tering the same one to another: as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.
<br>11	If any man speak, let him speak, as the words of God. If any man minister, let him do it, as of the power, which God administereth: that in all things God may be honoured through Jesus Christ: to whom is glory and empire for ever and ever. Amen.
<br>12	Dearly beloved, think not strange the burn- ing heat which is to try you, as if some new thing happened to you;
<br>13	But if you partake of the sufferings of Christ, rejoice that when his glory shall be re- vealed, you may also be glad with exceeding joy. 14 If you be reproached for the name of Christ, you shall be blessed: for that which is of the honour, glory, and power of God, and that which
<br>is his Spirit, resteth upon you.
<br>15 But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or a railer, or a coveter of other men’s
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>things.
<br>16 But if as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in that name. 17 For the time is, that judgment should begin at the house of God. And if first at us, what shall be the end of them that believe not the gospel
<br>of God?
<br>18 And if the just man shall scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear? 19 Wherefore let them also that suffer accord- ing to the will of God, commend their souls in
<br>good deeds to the faithful Creator.
<br>
<br>Chapter 5
<br>The ancients therefore that are among you, I be- seech, who am myself also an ancient, and a wit- ness of the sufferings of Christ: as also a partaker of that glory which is to be revealed in time to come:
<br>2	Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking care of it, not by constraint, but willingly, according to God: not for filthy lucre’s sake, but voluntarily:
<br>3	Neither as lording it over the clergy, but being made a pattern of the flock from the heart. 4 And when the prince of pastors shall appear,
<br>you shall receive a never fading crown of glory.
<br>5	In like manner, ye young men, be subject to the ancients. And do you all insinuate humility one to another, for God resisteth the proud, but to the humble he giveth grace.
<br>6	Be you humbled therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in the time of visitation:
<br>7	Casting all your care upon him, for he hath care of you.
<br>8	Be sober and watch: because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, goeth about seeking
<br> 
<br>whom he may devour.
<br>9	Whom resist ye, strong in faith: knowing that the same affliction befalls your brethren who are in the world.
