<br>It shall be the policy of the United States—
<br>
<br>(A) to oppose particularly severe violations of religious freedom that are or have been engaged in or tolerated by the governments of foreign countries; and
<br>
<br>(B) to promote the right to freedom of religion in those countries through the actions described in subsection (c).

<br>
<br>Whenever the President determines that the government of a foreign country has engaged in or tolerated particularly severe violations of religious freedom, the President shall oppose such violations and promote the right to religious freedom through one or more of the actions described in subsection (c).
<br>(b) Designations of countries of particular concern for religious freedom
<br>(1) Annual review
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Not later than 90 days after the date on which each Annual Report is submitted under section 6412(b) of this title, the President shall—
<br>
<br>(i) review the status of religious freedom in each foreign country to determine whether the government of that country has engaged in or tolerated particularly severe violations of religious freedom in each such country during the preceding 12 months or longer;
<br>
<br>(ii) designate each country the government of which has engaged in or tolerated violations described in clause (i) as a country of particular concern for religious freedom; and
<br>
<br>(iii) designate each country that engaged in or tolerated severe violations of religious freedom during the previous year, but does not meet, in the opinion of the President at the time of publication of the Annual Report, all of the criteria described in section 6402(15) of this title for designation under clause (ii) as being placed on a "Special Watch List".
<br>(B) Basis of review
<br>
<br>Each review conducted under subparagraph (A) shall be based upon information contained in the latest Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, the Annual Report, and on any other evidence available and shall take into account any findings or recommendations by the Commission with respect to the foreign country.
<br>(C) Implementation
<br>
<br>Any review under subparagraph (A) of a foreign country may take place singly or jointly with the review of one or more countries and may take place at any time before the date on which each Annual Report is submitted under section 6412(b) of this title.
<br>(2) Determinations of responsible parties
<br>
<br>For the government of each country designated as a country of particular concern for religious freedom under paragraph (1)(A), the President shall seek to determine the agency or instrumentality thereof and the specific officials thereof that are responsible for the particularly severe violations of religious freedom engaged in or tolerated by that government in order to appropriately target Presidential actions under this section in response.
<br>(3) Congressional notification
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Whenever the President designates a country as a country of particular concern for religious freedom under paragraph (1)(A)(ii), the President, not later than 90 days after such designation, shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees—
<br>
<br>(i) the designation of the country, signed by the President;
<br>
<br>(ii) the identification, if any, of responsible parties determined under paragraph (2); and
<br>
<br>(iii) a description of the actions taken under subsection (c), the purposes of the actions taken, and the effectiveness of the actions taken.
<br>(B) Removal of designation
<br>
<br>A country that is designated as a country of particular concern for religious freedom under paragraph (1)(A)(ii) shall retain such designation until the President determines and reports to the appropriate congressional committees that the country should no longer be so designated.
<br>(4) Effect on designation as country of particular concern
<br>
<br>The presence or absence of a country from the Special Watch List in any given year shall not preclude the designation of such country as a country of particular concern for religious freedom under paragraph (1)(A)(ii) in any such year.
<br>(c) Presidential actions with respect to countries of particular concern for religious freedom
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Subject to paragraphs (2), (3), (4), and (5) with respect to each country of particular concern for religious freedom designated under subsection (b)(1)(A), the President shall, after the requirements of sections 6443 and 6444 of this title have been satisfied, but not later than 90 days (or 180 days in case of a delay under paragraph (3)) after the date of designation of the country under that subsection, carry out one or more of the following actions under subparagraph (A) or subparagraph (B):
<br>(A) Presidential actions
<br>
<br>One or more of the Presidential actions described in paragraphs (9) through (15) of section 6445(a) of this title, as determined by the President.
<br>(B) Commensurate actions
<br>
<br>Commensurate action in substitution to any action described in subparagraph (A).
<br>(2) Substitution of binding agreements
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>In lieu of carrying out action under paragraph (1), the President may conclude a binding agreement with the respective foreign government as described in section 6445(c) of this title. The existence of a binding agreement under this paragraph with a foreign government may be considered by the President prior to making any determination or taking any action under this subchapter.
<br>(B) Statutory construction
<br>
<br>Nothing in this paragraph may be construed to authorize the entry of the United States into an agreement covering matters outside the scope of violations of religious freedom.
<br>(3) Authority for delay of Presidential actions
<br>
<br>If, on or before the date that the President is required (but for this paragraph) to take action under paragraph (1), the President determines and certifies to Congress that a single, additional period of time not to exceed 90 days is necessary—
<br>
<br>(A) for a continuation of negotiations that have been commenced with the government of that country to bring about a cessation of the violations by the foreign country;
<br>
<br>(B) for a continuation of multilateral negotiations into which the United States has entered to bring about a cessation of the violations by the foreign country;
<br>
<br>(C)(i) for a review of corrective action taken by the foreign country after designation of such country as a country of particular concern; or
<br>
<br>(ii) in anticipation that corrective action will be taken by the foreign country during the 90-day period,
<br>
<br>then the President shall not be required to take action until the expiration of that period of time.
<br>(4) Exception for ongoing Presidential action under this chapter
<br>
<br>The President shall not be required to take action pursuant to this subsection in the case of a country of particular concern for religious freedom, if with respect to such country—
<br>
<br>(A) the President has taken action pursuant to this chapter in a preceding year;
<br>
<br>(B) such action is in effect at the time the country is designated as a country of particular concern for religious freedom under this section; and
<br>
<br>(C) the President reports to Congress the information described in section 6444(a)(1), (2), (3), and (4) of this title regarding the actions in effect with respect to the country.
<br>(5) Exception for ongoing, multiple, broad-based sanctions in response to human rights violations
<br>
<br>At the time the President determines a country to be a country of particular concern, if that country is already subject to multiple, broad-based sanctions imposed in significant part in response to human rights abuses, and such sanctions are ongoing, the President may determine that one or more of these sanctions also satisfies the requirements of this subsection. In a report to Congress pursuant to section 6444(a)(1), (2), (3), and (4) of this title, and, as applicable, to section 6448 of this title, the President shall designate the specific sanction or sanctions that the President determines satisfy the requirements under this subsection and include a description of the impact of such sanction or sanctions on each country. The sanctions so designated shall remain in effect subject to section 6449 of this title.
<br>(d) Statutory construction
<br>
<br>A determination under this chapter, or any amendment made by this chapter, that a foreign country has engaged in or tolerated particularly severe violations of religious freedom shall not be construed to require the termination of assistance or other activities with respect to that country under any other provision of law, including section 2151n or 2304 of this title.

<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>The President, concurrent with the annual foreign country review required under section 402(b)(1)(A) of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6442(b)(1)(A)), shall—
<br>
<br>(1) review and identify any non-state actors operating in any such reviewed country or surrounding region that have engaged in particularly severe violations of religious freedom; and
<br>
<br>(2) designate, in a manner consistent with such Act [22 U.S.C. 6401 et seq.], each such non-state actor as an entity of particular concern for religious freedom.
<br>(b) Report
<br>
<br>Whenever the President designates a non-state actor under subsection (a) as an entity of particular concern for religious freedom, the President, as soon as practicable after the designation is made, shall submit a report to the appropriate congressional committees that describes the reasons for such designation.
<br>(c) Actions
<br>
<br>The President should take specific actions, when practicable, to address severe violations of religious freedom of non-state actors that are designated under subsection (a)(2).
<br>(d) Department of State annual report
<br>
<br>The Secretary of State should include information detailing the reasons the President designated a non-state actor as an entity of particular concern for religious freedom under subsection (a) in the Annual Report required under section 102(b)(1) of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6412(b)(1)).
<br>(e) Sense of Congress
<br>
<br>It is the sense of Congress that—
<br>
<br>(1) the Secretary of State should work with Congress and the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom—
<br>
<br>(A) to create new political, financial, and diplomatic tools to address severe violations of religious freedom by non-state actors; and
<br>
<br>(B) to update the actions the President can take under section 405 of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6445);
<br>
<br>(2) governments must ultimately be held accountable for the abuses that occur in their territories; and
<br>
<br>(3) any actions the President takes after designating a non-state actor as an entity of particular concern should also involve high-level diplomacy with the government of the country in which the non-state actor is operating.
<br>(f) Determinations of responsible parties
<br>
<br>In order to appropriately target Presidential actions under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6401 et seq.), the President, with respect to each non-state actor designated as an entity of particular concern for religious freedom under subsection (a), shall seek to determine, to the extent practicable, the specific officials or members that are responsible for the particularly severe violations of religious freedom engaged in or tolerated by such non-state actor.
<br>(g) Definitions
<br>
<br>In this section, the terms "appropriate congressional committees", "non-state actor", and "particularly severe violations of religious freedom" have the meanings given such terms in section 3 of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6402), as amended by section 3 of this Act.

<br>
<br>(A) under existing contracts or subcontracts, including the exercise of options for production quantities, to satisfy requirements essential to the national security of the United States;
<br>
<br>(B) if the President determines in writing and so reports to Congress that the person or other entity to which the Presidential action would otherwise be applied is a sole source supplier of the defense articles or services, that the defense articles or services are essential, and that alternative sources are not readily or reasonably available; or
<br>
<br>(C) if the President determines in writing and so reports to Congress that such articles or services are essential to the national security under defense coproduction agreements; or

<br>§6447. Presidential waiver
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>Subject to subsection (c), the President may waive, for a single, 180-day period, the application of any of the actions described in paragraphs (9) through (15) of section 6445(a) of this title (or commensurate action in substitution thereto) with respect to a country, if the President determines and so reports to the appropriate congressional committees that—
<br>
<br>(1) the exercise of such waiver authority would further the purposes of this chapter; or
<br>
<br>(2) the important national interest of the United States requires the exercise of such waiver authority.
<br>(b) Additional authority
<br>
<br>Subject to subsection (c), the President may waive, for any additional specified period of time after the 180-day period described in subsection (a), the application of any of the actions described in paragraphs (9) through (15) of section 6445(a) of this title (or a commensurate substitute action) with respect to a country, if the President determines and reports to the appropriate congressional committees that—
<br>
<br>(1) the respective foreign government has ceased the violations giving rise to the Presidential action; or
<br>
<br>(2) the important national interest of the United States requires the exercise of such waiver authority.
<br>(c) Congressional notification
<br>
<br>Not later than the date of the exercise of a waiver under subsection (a) or (b), the President shall notify the appropriate congressional committees of the waiver or the intention to exercise the waiver, together with a detailed justification thereof.
<br>(d) Sense of Congress
<br>
<br>It is the sense of Congress that—
<br>
<br>(1) ongoing and persistent waivers of the application of any of the actions described in paragraphs (9) through (15) of section 6445(a) of this title (or commensurate substitute action) with respect to a country do not fulfill the purposes of this chapter; and
<br>
<br>(2) because the promotion of religious freedom is an important interest of United States foreign policy, the President, the Secretary of State, and other executive branch officials, in consultation with Congress, should seek to find ways to address existing violations, on a case-by-case basis, through the actions described in section 6445 of this title or other commensurate substitute action.

<br>
<br>Not later than 120 days after November 29, 1999, the Secretary of State (after consultation with the Attorney General) shall issue guidelines to ensure that persons with potential biases against any refugee applicant, including persons employed by, or otherwise subject to influence by, governments known to be involved in persecution on account of religion, race, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion, shall not in any way be used in processing determinations of refugee status, including interpretation of conversations or examination of documents presented by such applicants.
<br>(d) Annual consultation

<br>The President shall include in each annual report on proposed refugee admissions under section 1157(d) of title 8 information about religious persecution of refugee populations eligible for consideration for admission to the United States.

<br>§6481. Business codes of conduct
<br>(a) Congressional finding
<br>
<br>Congress recognizes the increasing importance of transnational corporations as global actors, and their potential for providing positive leadership in their host countries in the area of human rights.
<br>(b) Sense of Congress
<br>
<br>It is the sense of the Congress that transnational corporations operating overseas, particularly those corporations operating in countries the governments of which have engaged in or tolerated violations of religious freedom, as identified in the Annual Report, should adopt codes of conduct—
<br>
<br>(1) upholding the right to freedom of religion of their employees; and
<br>
<br>(2) ensuring that a worker's religious views and peaceful practices of belief in no way affect, or be allowed to affect, the status or terms of his or her employment.

<br>
<br>(2) for their emphasis on teaching universally recognized rights of free inquiry and academic freedom.
<br>(b) Sense of Congress
<br>
<br>It is the sense of Congress that United States institutions of higher education operating campuses outside the United States or establishing any educational entities with foreign governments, particularly with or in countries the governments of which engage in or tolerate severe violations of religious freedom as identified in the Annual Report, should seek to adopt a voluntary code of conduct for operating in such countries that should—

<br>
<br>(2) ensure that the religious views and peaceful practice of religion in no way affect, or be allowed to affect, the status of a worker's or faculty member's employment or a student's enrollment; and

<br>§6483. Sense of Congress regarding national security strategy to promote religious freedom through United States foreign policy
<br>
<br>It is the sense of Congress that the annual national security strategy report of the President required under section 3043 of title 50—
