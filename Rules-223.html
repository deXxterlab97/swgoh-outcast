<br>
<br>Pub. L. 105–153, §1, Dec. 17, 1997, 111 Stat. 2689, provided that: "This Act [enacting section 15 of Pub. L. 92–463, set out in this Appendix, amending section 3 of Pub. L. 92–463, set out in this Appendix, renumbering former section 15 of Pub. L. 92–463, set out in this Appendix, as section 16, and enacting provisions set out as notes under sections 3 and 15 of Pub. L. 92–463, set out in this Appendix] may be cited as the 'Federal Advisory Committee Act Amendments of 1997'."
<br>§2. Findings and purpose
<br>
<br>(a) The Congress finds that there are numerous committees, boards, commissions, councils, and similar groups which have been established to advise officers and agencies in the executive branch of the Federal Government and that they are frequently a useful and beneficial means of furnishing expert advice, ideas, and diverse opinions to the Federal Government.
<br>
<br>(b) The Congress further finds and declares that—
<br>
<br>(1) the need for many existing advisory committees has not been adequately reviewed:
<br>
<br>(2) new advisory committees should be established only when they are determined to be essential and their number should be kept to the minimum necessary;
<br>
<br>(3) advisory committees should be terminated when they are no longer carrying out the purposes for which they were established;
<br>
<br>(4) standards and uniform procedures should govern the establishment, operation, administration, and duration of advisory committees;
<br>
<br>(5) the Congress and the public should be kept informed with respect to the number, purpose, membership, activities, and cost of advisory committees; and
<br>
<br>(6) the function of advisory committees should be advisory only, and that all matters under their consideration should be determined, in accordance with law, by the official, agency, or officer involved.

<br>
<br>By virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and statutes of the United States of America, including the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (5 U.S.C.

<br>Lobbyists on Agency Boards and Commissions
<br>
<br>Memorandum of President of the United States, June 18, 2010, 75 F.R. 35955, provided:
<br>
<br>Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
<br>
<br>My Administration is committed to reducing the undue influence of special interests that for too long has shaped the national agenda and drowned out the voices of ordinary Americans. Special interests exert this disproportionate influence, in part, by relying on lobbyists who have special access that is not available to all citizens. Although lobbyists can sometimes play a constructive role by communicating information to the government, their service in privileged positions within the executive branch can perpetuate the culture of special-interest access that I am committed to changing.
<br>
<br>On the day after my inauguration, I signed Executive Order 13490, which places strict limits on the ability of lobbyists to serve in Government positions related to their prior lobbying activities. Last September, we took another step to close the revolving door through which lobbyists enter and exit Government positions when we announced that my Administration aspires to keep Federal agencies' advisory boards free of federally registered lobbyists. Many departments and agencies are making this aspiration a reality by no longer placing federally registered lobbyists on advisory boards—a practice that I am now establishing as the official policy of my Administration.
<br>
<br>Accordingly, I hereby direct the heads of executive departments and agencies not to make any new appointments or reappointments of federally registered lobbyists to advisory committees and other boards and commissions. Within 90 days of the date of this memorandum, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall issue proposed guidance designed to implement this policy to the full extent permitted by law. The final guidance shall be issued following public comment on the proposed guidance.
<br>
<br>This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
<br>
<br>The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.
<br>
<br>Barack Obama.

<br>§5. Responsibilities of Congressional committees; review; guidelines
<br>
<br>(a) In the exercise of its legislative review function, each standing committee of the Senate and the House of Representatives shall make a continuing review of the activities of each advisory committee under its jurisdiction to determine whether such advisory committee should be abolished or merged with any other advisory committee, whether the responsibilities of such advisory committee should be revised, and whether such advisory committee performs a necessary function not already being performed.

<br>
<br>(b) In considering legislation establishing, or authorizing the establishment of any advisory committee, each standing committee of the Senate and of the House of Representatives shall determine, and report such determination to the Senate or to the House of Representatives, as the case may be, whether the functions of the proposed advisory committee are being or could be performed by one or more agencies or by an advisory committee already in existence, or by enlarging the mandate of an existing advisory committee. Any such legislation shall—

<br>
<br>(2) whether, consistent with the provisions of applicable statutes, the responsibilities assigned to it should be revised;
<br>
<br>(3) whether it should be merged with other advisory committees; or
<br>
<br>(4) whether it should be abolished.
<br>
<br>The Administrator may from time to time request such information as he deems necessary to carry out his functions under this subsection. Upon the completion of the Administrator's review he shall make recommendations to the President and to either the agency head or the Congress with respect to action he believes should be taken. Thereafter, the Administrator shall carry out a similar review annually. Agency heads shall cooperate with the Administrator in making the reviews required by this subsection.
<br>
<br>(c) The Administrator shall prescribe administrative guidelines and management controls applicable to advisory committees, and, to the maximum extent feasible, provide advice, assistance, and guidance to advisory committees to improve their performance. In carrying out his functions under this subsection, the Administrator shall consider the recommendations of each agency head with respect to means of improving the performance of advisory committees whose duties are related to such agency.
<br>
<br>(d)(1) The Administrator, after study and consultation with the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, shall establish guidelines with respect to uniform fair rates of pay for comparable services of members, staffs, and consultants of advisory committees in a manner which gives appropriate recognition to the responsibilities and qualifications required and other relevant factors. Such regulations shall provide that—

<br>

<br>
<br>(ii) who do not otherwise qualify for assistance under section 3102 of title 5, United States Code, by reason of being an employee of an agency (within the meaning of section 3102(a)(1) of such title 5),
<br>
<br>may be provided services pursuant to section 3102 of such title 5 while in performance of their advisory committee duties.
<br>
<br>(2) Nothing in this subsection shall prevent—
<br>
<br>(A) an individual who (without regard to his service with an advisory committee) is a full-time employee of the United States, or
<br>
<br>(B) an individual who immediately before his service with an advisory committee was such an employee,
<br>
<br>from receiving compensation at the rate at which he otherwise would be compensated (or was compensated) as a full-time employee of the United States.
<br>
<br>(e) The Administrator shall include in budget recommendations a summary of the amounts he deems necessary for the expenses of advisory committees, including the expenses for publication of reports where appropriate.

<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13875. Evaluating and Improving the Utility of Federal Advisory Committees
<br>
<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13875, June 14, 2019, 84 F.R. 28711, provided:
<br>
<br>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and consistent with the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), as amended (5 U.S.C. App.), it is hereby ordered as follows:
<br>
<br>Section 1. Review of Current Advisory Committees. (a) Each executive department and agency (agency) shall evaluate the need for each of its current advisory committees established under section 9(a)(2) of FACA and those advisory committees established under section 9(a)(1) that are authorized by law but not required by statute (eligible committees).
<br>
<br>(b) Each agency shall, by September 30, 2019, terminate at least one-third of its current committees established under section 9(a)(2) of FACA, including committees for which the:
<br>
<br>(i) stated objectives of the committee have been accomplished;
<br>
<br>(ii) subject matter or work of the committee has become obsolete;
<br>
<br>(iii) primary functions have been assumed by another entity; or
<br>
<br>(iv) agency determines that the cost of operation is excessive in relation to the benefits to the Federal Government.
<br>
<br>(c) Each agency may request a waiver of the requirement in subsection (b) of this section from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (Director). The Director may grant such a waiver if the Director concludes it is necessary for the delivery of essential services, for effective program delivery, or because it is otherwise warranted by the public interest.
<br>
<br>(d) Each agency that has fewer than three current eligible committees is exempt from subsection (b) of this section.
<br>
<br>(e) Agencies may count eligible committees terminated since January 20, 2017, toward the requirement of subsection (b) of this section.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. Limitations on New Advisory Committees. The Government-wide combined total number of eligible committees (excluding committees covered by section 6(d) of this order) shall not exceed 350. If the combined total number of eligible committees exceeds 350, an agency may not establish a new advisory committee under section 9(a)(2) of FACA, unless the agency obtains a waiver pursuant to subsection 4(b) of this order. Such a waiver is in addition to the notice and other requirements of FACA and its implementing regulations.
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. Reporting Requirements. (a) The head of each agency shall submit to the Director on or before August 1, 2019:
<br>
<br>(i) a recommendation for each of the agency's current advisory committees established by the President under section 9(a)(1) of FACA regarding whether the committee should be continued; and
<br>
<br>(ii) a detailed plan, for each advisory committee required by statute, for continuing or terminating such committee, including, as appropriate, recommended legislation for submission to the Congress.
<br>
<br>(b) The Administrator of General Services (Administrator) shall submit to the Director such justifications and recommendations required by subsection (a) of this section for independent Presidential advisory committees, as defined by 41 CFR 102-3.25.
<br>
<br>Sec. 4. Office of Management and Budget Role. (a) The Director, in coordination with the Administrator, shall issue instructions regarding the implementation of this order, including how to calculate the number of eligible committees to eliminate in each agency and how to comply with applicable law.
<br>
<br>(b) The Director may, with the concurrence of the Administrator, grant an agency a waiver of the requirements of section 2 of this order if the Director concludes that such waiver is necessary for the delivery of essential services, for effective program delivery, or because it is otherwise warranted by the public interest.
<br>
<br>(c) By September 1, 2019, the Director shall make appropriate recommendations to the President about terminating committees established by the President under section 9(a)(1) of FACA. The Director shall also include in the President's FY 2021 budget submission to the Congress a detailed plan for terminating such committees required by statute whose continued operations no longer serve the public interest, including with respect to the criteria set forth in subsection 1(b) of this order.
<br>
<br>Sec. 5. Exemption for Merit Review Panels. (a) The requirements of sections 1, 2, and 3 of this order do not apply to a merit review panel or advisory committee whose primary purpose is to provide scientific expertise to support agencies making decisions related to the safety or efficacy of products to be marketed to American consumers.
<br>
<br>(b) A merit review panel, for purposes of this order, is any collegial body whose approval is necessary to fund an extramural research procurement contract, grant, or cooperative agreement (including second level peer review), such as those at the National Institutes of Health.
<br>
<br>Sec. 6. General Provisions. (a) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
<br>
<br>(b) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
<br>
<br>(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or
<br>
<br>(ii) the functions of the Director relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
<br>
<br>(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
<br>
<br>(d) The provisions of this order do not apply to any independent regulatory agency, as that term is defined in section 3502(5) of title 44, United States Code.

<br>§15. Requirements relating to the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Public Administration
<br>
<br>(a) In General.—An agency may not use any advice or recommendation provided by the National Academy of Sciences or National Academy of Public Administration that was developed by use of a committee created by that academy under an agreement with an agency, unless—
<br>
<br>(1) the committee was not subject to any actual management or control by an agency or an officer of the Federal Government;
<br>
<br>(2) in the case of a committee created after the date of the enactment of the Federal Advisory Committee Act Amendments of 1997, the membership of the committee was appointed in accordance with the requirements described in subsection (b)(1); and
<br>
<br>(3) in developing the advice or recommendation, the academy complied with—
<br>
<br>(A) subsection (b)(2) through (6), in the case of any advice or recommendation provided by the National Academy of Sciences; or
<br>
<br>(B) subsection (b)(2) and (5), in the case of any advice or recommendation provided by the National Academy of Public Administration.
<br>
<br>(b) Requirements.—The requirements referred to in subsection (a) are as follows:
<br>
<br>(1) The Academy shall determine and provide public notice of the names and brief biographies of individuals that the Academy appoints or intends to appoint to serve on the committee. The Academy shall determine and provide a reasonable opportunity for the public to comment on such appointments before they are made or, if the Academy determines such prior comment is not practicable, in the period immediately following the appointments. The Academy shall make its best efforts to ensure that (A) no individual appointed to serve on the committee has a conflict of interest that is relevant to the functions to be performed, unless such conflict is promptly and publicly disclosed and the Academy determines that the conflict is unavoidable, (B) the committee membership is fairly balanced as determined by the Academy to be appropriate for the functions to be performed, and (C) the final report of the Academy will be the result of the Academy's independent judgment. The Academy shall require that individuals that the Academy appoints or intends to appoint to serve on the committee inform the Academy of the individual's conflicts of interest that are relevant to the functions to be performed.
<br>
<br>(2) The Academy shall determine and provide public notice of committee meetings that will be open to the public.
<br>
<br>(3) The Academy shall ensure that meetings of the committee to gather data from individuals who are not officials, agents, or employees of the Academy are open to the public, unless the Academy determines that a meeting would disclose matters described in section 552(b) of title 5, United States Code. The Academy shall make available to the public, at reasonable charge if appropriate, written materials presented to the committee by individuals who are not officials, agents, or employees of the Academy, unless the Academy determines that making material available would disclose matters described in that section.
<br>
<br>(4) The Academy shall make available to the public as soon as practicable, at reasonable charge if appropriate, a brief summary of any committee meeting that is not a data gathering meeting, unless the Academy determines that the summary would disclose matters described in section 552(b) of title 5, United States Code. The summary shall identify the committee members present, the topics discussed, materials made available to the committee, and such other matters that the Academy determines should be included.
<br>
<br>(5) The Academy shall make available to the public its final report, at reasonable charge if appropriate, unless the Academy determines that the report would disclose matters described in section 552(b) of title 5, United States Code. If the Academy determines that the report would disclose matters described in that section, the Academy shall make public an abbreviated version of the report that does not disclose those matters.
<br>
<br>(6) After publication of the final report, the Academy shall make publicly available the names of the principal reviewers who reviewed the report in draft form and who are not officials, agents, or employees of the Academy.
<br>
<br>(c) Regulations.—The Administrator of General Services may issue regulations implementing this section.
