<br>Editorial Notes
<br>References in Text
<br>
<br>Section 2223 of this title, referred to in par. (e), was in the original "section 204 of the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act", meaning section 204 of Pub. L. 111–353, which enacted section 2223 of this title and amended this section and section 381 of this title.
<br>
<br>Section 353c of this title, referred to in par. (kk), was in the original a reference to section 503B of act June 25, 1938, and was translated as if it referred to section 503C of that Act, to reflect the probable intent of Congress and the renumbering of section 503B as 503C by Pub. L. 113–54, title I, §102(a)(1), Nov. 27, 2013, 127 Stat. 587, and its transfer to section 353c of this title. A new section 503B, which was enacted by section 102(a)(2) of Pub. L. 113–54, is classified to section 353b of this title and does not relate to television advertisements.

<br>
<br>(B) Subparagraph (A) shall not apply—
<br>

<br>
<br>(4)(A) Any responsible person (as such term is used in section 355–1 of this title) that violates a requirement of section 355(o), 355(p), or 355–1 of this title shall be subject to a civil monetary penalty of—
<br>
<br>(i) not more than $250,000 per violation, and not to exceed $1,000,000 for all such violations adjudicated in a single proceeding; or

<br>
<br>(5)(A) A civil penalty under paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), or (9) shall be assessed, or a no-tobacco-sale order may be imposed, by the Secretary by an order made on the record after opportunity for a hearing provided in accordance with this subparagraph and section 554 of title 5. Before issuing such an order, the Secretary shall give written notice to the person to be assessed a civil penalty, or upon whom a no-tobacco-sale order is to be imposed, under such order of the Secretary's proposal to issue such order and provide such person an opportunity for a hearing on the order. In the course of any investigation, the Secretary may issue subpoenas requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence that relates to the matter under investigation.
<br>
<br>(B) In determining the amount of a civil penalty, or the period to be covered by a no-tobacco-sale order, the Secretary shall take into account the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation or violations and, with respect to the violator, ability to pay, effect on ability to continue to do business, any history of prior such violations, the degree of culpability, and such other matters as justice may require. A no-tobacco-sale order permanently prohibiting an individual retail outlet from selling tobacco products shall include provisions that allow the outlet, after a specified period of time, to request that the Secretary compromise, modify, or terminate the order.
<br>
<br>(C) The Secretary may compromise, modify, or remit, with or without conditions, any civil penalty which may be assessed under paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), or (9). The amount of such penalty, when finally determined, or the amount agreed upon in compromise, may be deducted from any sums owing by the United States to the person charged.
<br>
<br>(D) The Secretary may compromise, modify, or terminate, with or without conditions, any no-tobacco-sale order.
<br>
<br>(6) Any person who requested, in accordance with paragraph (5)(A), a hearing respecting the assessment of a civil penalty or the imposition of a no-tobacco-sale order and who is aggrieved by an order assessing a civil penalty or the imposition of a no-tobacco-sale order may file a petition for judicial review of such order with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit or for any other circuit in which such person resides or transacts business. Such a petition may only be filed within the 60-day period beginning on the date the order making such assessment was issued, or on which the no-tobacco-sale order was imposed, as the case may be.
<br>
<br>(7) If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty—
<br>
<br>(A) after the order making the assessment becomes final, and if such person does not file a petition for judicial review of the order in accordance with paragraph (6), or
<br>
<br>(B) after a court in an action brought under paragraph (6) has entered a final judgment in favor of the Secretary,
<br>
<br>the Attorney General shall recover the amount assessed (plus interest at currently prevailing rates from the date of the expiration of the 60-day period referred to in paragraph (6) or the date of such final judgment, as the case may be) in an action brought in any appropriate district court of the United States. In such an action, the validity, amount, and appropriateness of such penalty shall not be subject to review.
<br>
<br>(8) If the Secretary finds that a person has committed repeated violations of section 387f(d)(5) of this title or of restrictions promulgated under section 387f(d) of this title at a particular retail outlet then the Secretary may impose a no-tobacco-sale order on that person prohibiting the sale of tobacco products in that outlet. A no-tobacco-sale order may be imposed with a civil penalty under paragraph (1). Prior to the entry of a no-sale order under this paragraph, a person shall be entitled to a hearing pursuant to the procedures established through regulations of the Food and Drug Administration for assessing civil money penalties, including at a retailer's request a hearing by telephone, or at the nearest regional or field office of the Food and Drug Administration, or at a Federal, State, or county facility within 100 miles from the location of the retail outlet, if such a facility is available.

<br>(II) in the case of a violation that continues after the Secretary provides written notice to such person, $250,000 for the first 30-day period (or any portion thereof) that the person continues to be in violation, and such amount shall double for every 30-day period thereafter that the violation continues, not to exceed $1,000,000 for any 30-day period, and not to exceed $10,000,000 for all such violations adjudicated in a single proceeding.
<br>

<br>(g) Violations regarding direct-to-consumer advertising
<br>
<br>(1) With respect to a person who is a holder of an approved application under section 355 of this title for a drug subject to section 353(b) of this title or under section 262 of title 42, any such person who disseminates or causes another party to disseminate a direct-to-consumer advertisement that is false or misleading shall be liable to the United States for a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed $250,000 for the first such violation in any 3-year period, and not to exceed $500,000 for each subsequent violation in any 3-year period. No other civil monetary penalties in this chapter (including the civil penalty in subsection (f)(4)) shall apply to a violation regarding direct-to-consumer advertising. For purposes of this paragraph: (A) Repeated dissemination of the same or similar advertisement prior to the receipt of the written notice referred to in paragraph (2) for such advertisements shall be considered one violation. (B) On and after the date of the receipt of such a notice, all violations under this paragraph occurring in a single day shall be considered one violation. With respect to advertisements that appear in magazines or other publications that are published less frequently than daily, each issue date (whether weekly or monthly) shall be treated as a single day for the purpose of calculating the number of violations under this paragraph.
<br>
<br>(2) A civil penalty under paragraph (1) shall be assessed by the Secretary by an order made on the record after providing written notice to the person to be assessed a civil penalty and an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with this paragraph and section 554 of title 5. If upon receipt of the written notice, the person to be assessed a civil penalty objects and requests a hearing, then in the course of any investigation related to such hearing, the Secretary may issue subpoenas requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence that relates to the matter under investigation, including information pertaining to the factors described in paragraph (3).
<br>
<br>(3) The Secretary, in determining the amount of the civil penalty under paragraph (1), shall take into account the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation or violations, including the following factors:

<br>Editorial Notes
<br>References in Text
<br>
<br>The Controlled Substances Act, referred to in subsec. (e)(3), is title II of Pub. L. 91–513, Oct. 27, 1970, 84 Stat. 1242, which is classified principally to subchapter I (§801 et seq.) of chapter 13 of this title. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under section 801 of this title and Tables.
<br>
<br>Section 282(j)(5)(C)(ii) of title 42, referred to in subsec. (f)(3)(B), was in the original "section 402(j)(5)(C)(ii)", and was translated as meaning section 402(j)(5)(C)(ii) of the Public Health Service Act to reflect the probable intent of Congress because there is no subsec. (j) of section 402 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and section 402(j)(5)(C)(ii) of the Public Health Service Act relates to notification of noncompliance with clinical trial information requirements.
<br>
<br>Section 353c of this title, referred to in subsec. (g)(3)(B), was in the original a reference to section 503B of act June 25, 1938, and was translated as if it referred to section 503C of that Act, to reflect the probable intent of Congress and the renumbering of section 503B as 503C by Pub. L. 113–54, title I, §102(a)(1), Nov. 27, 2013, 127 Stat. 587, and its transfer to section 353c of this title. A new section 503B, which was enacted by section 102(a)(2) of Pub. L. 113–54, is classified to section 353b of this title and does not relate to television advertisements.

<br>
<br>"(ii) informing its employees of all applicable laws;

<br>

<br>
<br>"(C) Consideration of state penalties.—The Secretary shall coordinate with the States in enforcing the provisions of this Act [probably means div. A of Pub. L. 111–31, see Short Title of 2009 Amendment note set out under section 301 of this title and Tables for classifications] and, for purposes of mitigating a civil penalty to be applied for a violation by a retailer of section 906(d)(5) [21 U.S.C. 387f(d)(5)] or of any restriction promulgated under section 906(d) [21 U.S.C. 387f(d)], shall consider the amount of any penalties paid by the retailer to a State for the same violation."
<br>Construction of 2011 Amendment
<br>
<br>Nothing in amendment by Pub. L. 111–353 to be construed to alter jurisdiction and authorities established under certain other Acts or in a manner inconsistent with international agreements to which the United States is a party, see sections 2251 and 2252 of this title.

<br>§333a. Repealed. Pub. L. 101–647, title XIX, §1905, Nov. 29, 1990, 104 Stat. 4853
<br>
<br>Section, Pub. L. 100–690, title II, §2401, Nov. 18, 1988, 102 Stat. 4230, related to forfeiture and illegal trafficking in steroids or human growth hormones.
<br>§334. Seizure
<br>(a) Grounds and jurisdiction
<br>
<br>(1) Any article of food, drug, or cosmetic that is adulterated or misbranded when introduced into or while in interstate commerce or while held for sale (whether or not the first sale) after shipment in interstate commerce, or which may not, under the provisions of section 331(ll), 344, or 355 of this title, be introduced into interstate commerce, shall be liable to be proceeded against while in interstate commerce, or at any time thereafter, on libel of information and condemned in any district court of the United States or United States court of a Territory within the jurisdiction of which the article is found. No libel for condemnation shall be instituted under this chapter, for any alleged misbranding if there is pending in any court a libel for condemnation proceeding under this chapter based upon the same alleged misbranding, and not more than one such proceeding shall be instituted if no such proceeding is so pending, except that such limitations shall not apply (A) when such misbranding has been the basis of a prior judgment in favor of the United States, in a criminal, injunction, or libel for condemnation proceeding under this chapter, or (B) when the Secretary has probable cause to believe from facts found, without hearing, by him or any officer or employee of the Department that the misbranded article is dangerous to health, or that the labeling of the misbranded article is fraudulent, or would be in a material respect misleading to the injury or damage of the purchaser or consumer. In any case where the number of libel for condemnation proceedings is limited as above provided the proceeding pending or instituted shall, on application of the claimant, seasonably made, be removed for trial to any district agreed upon by stipulation between the parties, or, in case of failure to so stipulate within a reasonable time, the claimant may apply to the court of the district in which the seizure has been made, and such court (after giving the United States attorney for such district reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard) shall by order, unless good cause to the contrary is shown, specify a district of reasonable proximity to the claimant's principal place of business, to which the case shall be removed for trial.
<br>
<br>(2) The following shall be liable to be proceeded against at any time on libel of information and condemned in any district court of the United States or United States court of a Territory within the jurisdiction of which they are found: (A) Any drug that is a counterfeit drug, (B) Any container of a counterfeit drug, (C) Any punch, die, plate, stone, labeling, container, or other thing used or designed for use in making a counterfeit drug or drugs, (D) Any adulterated or misbranded device, and (E) Any adulterated or misbranded tobacco product.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), no libel for condemnation may be instituted under paragraph (1) or (2) against any food which—
<br>
<br>(i) is misbranded under section 343(a)(2) of this title because of its advertising, and
<br>
<br>(ii) is being held for sale to the ultimate consumer in an establishment other than an establishment owned or operated by a manufacturer, packer, or distributor of the food.
<br>
<br>(B) A libel for condemnation may be instituted under paragraph (1) or (2) against a food described in subparagraph (A) if—
<br>
<br>(i)(I) the food's advertising which resulted in the food being misbranded under section 343(a)(2) of this title was disseminated in the establishment in which the food is being held for sale to the ultimate consumer,
<br>
<br>(II) such advertising was disseminated by, or under the direction of, the owner or operator of such establishment, or
<br>
<br>(III) all or part of the cost of such advertising was paid by such owner or operator; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the owner or operator of such establishment used such advertising in the establishment to promote the sale of the food.
<br>(b) Procedure; multiplicity of pending proceedings
<br>
<br>The article, equipment, or other thing proceeded against shall be liable to seizure by process pursuant to the libel, and the procedure in cases under this section shall conform, as nearly as may be, to the procedure in admiralty; except that on demand of either party any issue of fact joined in any such case shall be tried by jury. When libel for condemnation proceedings under this section, involving the same claimant and the same issues of adulteration or misbranding, are pending in two or more jurisdictions, such pending proceedings, upon application of the claimant seasonably made to the court of one such jurisdiction, shall be consolidated for trial by order of such court, and tried in (1) any district selected by the claimant where one of such proceedings is pending; or (2) a district agreed upon by stipulation between the parties. If no order for consolidation is so made within a reasonable time, the claimant may apply to the court of one such jurisdiction and such court (after giving the United States attorney for such district reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard) shall by order, unless good cause to the contrary is shown, specify a district of reasonable proximity to the claimant's principal place of business, in which all such pending proceedings shall be consolidated for trial and tried. Such order of consolidation shall not apply so as to require the removal of any case the date for trial of which has been fixed. The court granting such order shall give prompt notification thereof to the other courts having jurisdiction of the cases covered thereby.
<br>(c) Availability of samples of seized goods prior to trial
<br>
<br>The court at any time after seizure up to a reasonable time before trial shall by order allow any party to a condemnation proceeding, his attorney or agent, to obtain a representative sample of the article seized and a true copy of the analysis, if any, on which the proceeding is based and the identifying marks or numbers, if any, of the packages from which the samples analyzed were obtained.
<br>(d) Disposition of goods after decree of condemnation; claims for remission or mitigation of forfeitures
<br>
<br>(1) Any food, drug, device, tobacco product, or cosmetic condemned under this section shall, after entry of the decree, be disposed of by destruction or sale as the court may, in accordance with the provisions of this section, direct and the proceeds thereof, if sold, less the legal costs and charges, shall be paid into the Treasury of the United States; but such article shall not be sold under such decree contrary to the provisions of this chapter or the laws of the jurisdiction in which sold. After entry of the decree and upon the payment of the costs of such proceedings and the execution of a good and sufficient bond conditioned that such article shall not be sold or disposed of contrary to the provisions of this chapter or the laws of any State or Territory in which sold, the court may by order direct that such article be delivered to the owner thereof to be destroyed or brought into compliance with the provisions of this chapter, under the supervision of an officer or employee duly designated by the Secretary, and the expenses of such supervision shall be paid by the person obtaining release of the article under bond. If the article was imported into the United States and the person seeking its release establishes (A) that the adulteration, misbranding, or violation did not occur after the article was imported, and (B) that he had no cause for believing that it was adulterated, misbranded, or in violation before it was released from customs custody, the court may permit the article to be delivered to the owner for exportation in lieu of destruction upon a showing by the owner that all of the conditions of section 381(e) of this title can and will be met. The provisions of this sentence shall not apply where condemnation is based upon violation of section 342(a)(1), (2), or (6), section 351(a)(3), section 352(j), or section 361(a) or (d) of this title. Where such exportation is made to the original foreign supplier, then subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 381(e)(1) of this title and the preceding sentence shall not be applicable; and in all cases of exportation the bond shall be conditioned that the article shall not be sold or disposed of until the applicable conditions of section 381(e) of this title have been met. Any person seeking to export an imported article pursuant to any of the provisions of this subsection shall establish that the article was intended for export at the time the article entered commerce. Any article condemned by reason of its being an article which may not, under section 344 or 355 of this title, be introduced into interstate commerce, shall be disposed of by destruction.
<br>
<br>(2) The provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection shall, to the extent deemed appropriate by the court, apply to any equipment or other thing which is not otherwise within the scope of such paragraph and which is referred to in paragraph (2) of subsection (a).
<br>
<br>(3) Whenever in any proceeding under this section, involving paragraph (2) of subsection (a), the condemnation of any equipment or thing (other than a drug) is decreed, the court shall allow the claim of any claimant, to the extent of such claimant's interest, for remission or mitigation of such forfeiture if such claimant proves to the satisfaction of the court (i) that he has not committed or caused to be committed any prohibited act referred to in such paragraph (2) and has no interest in any drug referred to therein, (ii) that he has an interest in such equipment or other thing as owner or lienor or otherwise, acquired by him in good faith, and (iii) that he at no time had any knowledge or reason to believe that such equipment or other thing was being or would be used in, or to facilitate, the violation of laws of the United States relating to counterfeit drugs.
<br>(e) Costs
<br>
<br>When a decree of condemnation is entered against the article, court costs and fees, and storage and other proper expenses, shall be awarded against the person, if any, intervening as claimant of the article.
<br>(f) Removal of case for trial
<br>
<br>In the case of removal for trial of any case as provided by subsection (a) or (b)—
<br>
<br>(1) The clerk of the court from which removal is made shall promptly transmit to the court in which the case is to be tried all records in the case necessary in order that such court may exercise jurisdiction.
<br>
<br>(2) The court to which such case was removed shall have the powers and be subject to the duties, for purposes of such case, which the court from which removal was made would have had, or to which such court would have been subject, if such case had not been removed.
<br>(g) Administrative restraint; detention orders
<br>
<br>(1) If during an inspection conducted under section 374 of this title of a facility or a vehicle, a device, drug, or tobacco product which the officer or employee making the inspection has reason to believe is adulterated or misbranded is found in such facility or vehicle, such officer or employee may order the device, drug, or tobacco product detained (in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary) for a reasonable period which may not exceed twenty days unless the Secretary determines that a period of detention greater than twenty days is required to institute an action under subsection (a) or section 332 of this title, in which case he may authorize a detention period of not to exceed thirty days. Regulations of the Secretary prescribed under this paragraph shall require that before a device, drug, or tobacco product may be ordered detained under this paragraph the Secretary or an officer or employee designated by the Secretary approve such order. A detention order under this paragraph may require the labeling or marking of a device, drug, or tobacco product during the period of its detention for the purpose of identifying the device, drug, or tobacco product as detained. Any person who would be entitled to claim a device, drug, or tobacco product if it were seized under subsection (a) may appeal to the Secretary a detention of such device, drug, or tobacco product under this paragraph. Within five days of the date an appeal of a detention is filed with the Secretary, the Secretary shall after affording opportunity for an informal hearing by order confirm the detention or revoke it.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) Except as authorized by subparagraph (B), a device, drug, or tobacco product subject to a detention order issued under paragraph (1) shall not be moved by any person from the place at which it is ordered detained until—
<br>
<br>(i) released by the Secretary, or
<br>
<br>(ii) the expiration of the detention period applicable to such order,
<br>
<br>whichever occurs first.
<br>
<br>(B) A device or drug subject to a detention order under paragraph (1) may be moved—
<br>
<br>(i) in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, and
<br>
<br>(ii) if not in final form for shipment, at the discretion of the manufacturer of the device or drug for the purpose of completing the work required to put it in such form.
<br>(h) Administrative detention of foods
<br>(1) Detention authority
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>An officer or qualified employee of the Food and Drug Administration may order the detention, in accordance with this subsection, of any article of food that is found during an inspection, examination, or investigation under this chapter conducted by such officer or qualified employee, if the officer or qualified employee has reason to believe that such article is adulterated or misbranded.
<br>(B) Secretary's approval
<br>
<br>An article of food may be ordered detained under subparagraph (A) only if the Secretary or an official designated by the Secretary approves the order. An official may not be so designated unless the official is the director of the district under this chapter in which the article involved is located, or is an official senior to such director.
<br>(2) Period of detention
<br>
<br>An article of food may be detained under paragraph (1) for a reasonable period, not to exceed 20 days, unless a greater period, not to exceed 30 days, is necessary, to enable the Secretary to institute an action under subsection (a) or section 332 of this title. The Secretary shall by regulation provide for procedures for instituting such action on an expedited basis with respect to perishable foods.
<br>(3) Security of detained article
<br>
<br>An order under paragraph (1) with respect to an article of food may require that such article be labeled or marked as detained, and shall require that the article be removed to a secure facility, as appropriate. An article subject to such an order shall not be transferred by any person from the place at which the article is ordered detained, or from the place to which the article is so removed, as the case may be, until released by the Secretary or until the expiration of the detention period applicable under such order, whichever occurs first. This subsection may not be construed as authorizing the delivery of the article pursuant to the execution of a bond while the article is subject to the order, and section 381(b) of this title does not authorize the delivery of the article pursuant to the execution of a bond while the article is subject to the order.
<br>(4) Appeal of detention order
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>With respect to an article of food ordered detained under paragraph (1), any person who would be entitled to be a claimant for such article if the article were seized under subsection (a) may appeal the order to the Secretary. Within five days after such an appeal is filed, the Secretary, after providing opportunity for an informal hearing, shall confirm or terminate the order involved, and such confirmation by the Secretary shall be considered a final agency action for purposes of section 702 of title 5. If during such five-day period the Secretary fails to provide such an opportunity, or to confirm or terminate such order, the order is deemed to be terminated.
<br>(B) Effect of instituting court action
<br>
<br>The process under subparagraph (A) for the appeal of an order under paragraph (1) terminates if the Secretary institutes an action under subsection (a) or section 332 of this title regarding the article of food involved.
<br>(i) Procedures for promulgating regulations
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>In promulgating a regulation implementing this section, the Secretary shall—
<br>
<br>(A) issue a notice of proposed rulemaking that includes the proposed regulation;
<br>
<br>(B) provide a period of not less than 60 days for comments on the proposed regulation; and
<br>
<br>(C) publish the final regulation not less than 30 days before the regulation's effective date.
<br>(2) Restrictions
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal law, in implementing this section, the Secretary shall only promulgate regulations as described in paragraph (1).
