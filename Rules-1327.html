<br>§2501. Declaration of policy
<br>(a) Recognition
<br>
<br>Congress recognizes that the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act [25 U.S.C. 5301 et seq.], which was a product of the legitimate aspirations and a recognition of the inherent authority of Indian nations, was and is a crucial positive step toward tribal and community control and that the United States has an obligation to assure maximum Indian participation in the direction of educational services so as to render the persons administering such services and the services themselves more responsive to the needs and desires of Indian communities.
<br>(b) Commitment
<br>
<br>Congress declares its commitment to the maintenance of the Federal Government's unique and continuing trust relationship with and responsibility to the Indian people for the education of Indian children through the establishment of a meaningful Indian self-determination policy for education that will deter further perpetuation of Federal bureaucratic domination of programs.
<br>(c) National goal
<br>
<br>Congress declares that a national goal of the United States is to provide the resources, processes, and structure that will enable tribes and local communities to obtain the quantity and quality of educational services and opportunities that will permit Indian children—
<br>
<br>(1) to compete and excel in areas of their choice; and
<br>
<br>(2) to achieve the measure of self-determination essential to their social and economic well-being.
<br>(d) Educational needs
<br>
<br>Congress affirms—
<br>
<br>(1) true self-determination in any society of people is dependent upon an educational process that will ensure the development of qualified people to fulfill meaningful leadership roles;
<br>
<br>(2) that Indian people have special and unique educational needs, including the need for programs to meet the linguistic and cultural aspirations of Indian tribes and communities; and
<br>
<br>(3) that those needs may best be met through a grant process.
<br>(e) Federal relations
<br>
<br>Congress declares a commitment to the policies described in this section and support, to the full extent of congressional responsibility, for Federal relations with the Indian nations.
<br>(f) Termination
<br>
<br>Congress repudiates and rejects House Concurrent Resolution 108 of the 83d Congress and any policy of unilateral termination of Federal relations with any Indian nation.

<br>
<br>In making the determination under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall give equal consideration to each of the following factors:

<br>
<br>(I) the adequacy of facilities or the potential to obtain or provide adequate facilities;
<br>
<br>(II) geographic and demographic factors in the affected areas;
<br>
<br>(III) adequacy of the applicant's program plans;
<br>
<br>(IV) geographic proximity of comparable public education; and
<br>
<br>(V) the needs as expressed by all affected parties, including but not limited to students, families, tribal governments at both the central and local levels, and school organizations.
<br>
<br>(ii) With respect to all education services already available—

<br>(I) geographic and demographic factors in the affected areas;
<br>
<br>(II) adequacy and comparability of programs already available;

<br>(d) Filing of applications and reports
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>All applications and reports submitted to the Secretary under this chapter, and any amendments to such applications or reports, shall be filed with the education line officer designated by the Director of the Office of Indian Education Programs of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

<br>
<br>Any application that is submitted under this chapter shall be accompanied by a document indicating the action taken by the tribal governing body in authorizing such application.
<br>(e) Effective date for approved applications

<br>(ii) The Secretary determines that there is a reasonable expectation that the certification or accreditation described in clause (i), or candidacy in good standing for such certification or accreditation, will be achieved by the school within 3 years.

<br>(2) Notice requirements for revocation
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall not revoke a determination that a school is eligible for assistance under this chapter, or reassume control of a school that was a Bureau school prior to approval of an application submitted under section 2505(b)(1)(A) 2 of this title until the Secretary—
