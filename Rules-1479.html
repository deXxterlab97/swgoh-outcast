<br>§718. Traditionally underserved populations
<br>(a) Findings
<br>
<br>With respect to the programs authorized in subchapters II through VII, the Congress finds as follows:
<br>(1) Racial profile
<br>
<br>The demographic profile of America is rapidly changing. While the percentage increase from 2000 to 2010 for white Americans was 9.7 percent, the percentage increase for racial and ethnic minorities was much higher: 43.0 percent for Latinos, 12.3 percent for African-Americans, and 43.2 percent for Asian-Americans.
<br>(2) Rate of disability
<br>
<br>Ethnic and racial minorities tend to have disabling conditions at a disproportionately high rate. In 2011—
<br>
<br>(A) among Americans ages 16 through 64, the rate of disability was 12.1 percent;
<br>
<br>(B) among African-Americans in that age range, the disability rate was more than twice as high, at 27.1 percent; and
<br>
<br>(C) for American Indians and Alaska Natives in the same age range, the disability rate was also more than twice as high, at 27.0 percent.
<br>(3) Inequitable treatment
<br>
<br>Patterns of inequitable treatment of minorities have been documented in all major junctures of the vocational rehabilitation process. As compared to white Americans, a larger percentage of African-American applicants to the vocational rehabilitation system is denied acceptance. Of applicants accepted for service, a larger percentage of African-American cases is closed without being rehabilitated. Minorities are provided less training than their white counterparts. Consistently, less money is spent on minorities than on their white counterparts.
<br>(4) Recruitment
<br>
<br>Recruitment efforts within vocational rehabilitation at the level of preservice training, continuing education, and in-service training must focus on bringing larger numbers of minorities into the profession in order to provide appropriate practitioner knowledge, role models, and sufficient manpower to address the clearly changing demography of vocational rehabilitation.
<br>(b) Outreach to minorities
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>For each fiscal year, the Commissioner and the Director of the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (referred to in this subsection as the "Director") shall reserve 1 percent of the funds appropriated for the fiscal year for programs authorized under subchapters II, III, VI, and VII to carry out this subsection. The Commissioner and the Director shall use the reserved funds to carry out one or more of the activities described in paragraph (2) through a grant, contract, or cooperative agreement.
<br>(2) Activities
<br>
<br>The activities carried out by the Commissioner and the Director shall include one or more of the following:
<br>
<br>(A) Making awards to minority entities and Indian tribes to carry out activities under the programs authorized under subchapters II, III, VI, and VII.
<br>
<br>(B) Making awards to minority entities and Indian tribes to conduct research, training, technical assistance, or a related activity, to improve services provided under this chapter, especially services provided to individuals from minority backgrounds.
<br>
<br>(C) Making awards to entities described in paragraph (3) to provide outreach and technical assistance to minority entities and Indian tribes to promote their participation in activities funded under this chapter, including assistance to enhance their capacity to carry out such activities.
<br>(3) Eligibility
<br>
<br>To be eligible to receive an award under paragraph (2)(C), an entity shall be a State or a public or private nonprofit agency or organization, such as an institution of higher education or an Indian tribe.
<br>(4) Report
<br>
<br>In each fiscal year, the Commissioner and the Director shall prepare and submit to Congress a report that describes the activities funded under this subsection for the preceding fiscal year.
<br>(5) Definitions
<br>
<br>In this subsection:
<br>(A) Historically Black college or university
<br>
<br>The term "historically Black college or university" means a part B institution, as defined in section 1061(2) of title 20.
<br>(B) Minority entity
<br>
<br>The term "minority entity" means an entity that is a historically Black college or university, a Hispanic-serving institution of higher education, an American Indian tribal college or university, or another institution of higher education whose minority student enrollment is at least 50 percent.
<br>(c) Demonstration
<br>
<br>In awarding grants, or entering into contracts or cooperative agreements under subchapters I, II, III, VI, and VII of this chapter, and section 794e of this title, the Commissioner and the Director of the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research, in appropriate cases, shall require applicants to demonstrate how the applicants will address, in whole or in part, the needs of individuals with disabilities from minority backgrounds.

<br>Part A—General Provisions
<br>§720. Declaration of policy; authorization of appropriations
<br>(a) Findings; purpose; policy
<br>(1) Findings
<br>
<br>Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(A) work—
<br>
<br>(i) is a valued activity, both for individuals and society; and
<br>
<br>(ii) fulfills the need of an individual to be productive, promotes independence, enhances self-esteem, and allows for participation in the mainstream of life in the United States;
<br>
<br>(B) as a group, individuals with disabilities experience staggering levels of unemployment and poverty;
<br>
<br>(C) individuals with disabilities, including individuals with the most significant disabilities, have demonstrated their ability to achieve gainful employment in competitive integrated employment settings if appropriate services and supports are provided;
<br>
<br>(D) reasons for significant numbers of individuals with disabilities not working, or working at levels not commensurate with their abilities and capabilities, include—
<br>
<br>(i) discrimination;
<br>
<br>(ii) lack of accessible and available transportation;
<br>
<br>(iii) fear of losing health coverage under the Medicare and Medicaid programs carried out under titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq. and 1396 et seq.) or fear of losing private health insurance; and
<br>
<br>(iv) lack of education, training, and supports to meet job qualification standards necessary to secure, retain, regain, or advance in employment;
<br>
<br>(E) enforcement of subchapter V and of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.) holds the promise of ending discrimination for individuals with disabilities;
<br>
<br>(F) the provision of workforce development activities and vocational rehabilitation services can enable individuals with disabilities, including individuals with the most significant disabilities, to pursue meaningful careers by securing gainful employment commensurate with their abilities and capabilities; and
<br>
<br>(G) linkages between the vocational rehabilitation programs established under this subchapter and other components of the statewide workforce development systems are critical to ensure effective and meaningful participation by individuals with disabilities in workforce development activities.
<br>(2) Purpose
<br>
<br>The purpose of this subchapter is to assist States in operating statewide comprehensive, coordinated, effective, efficient, and accountable programs of vocational rehabilitation, each of which is—
<br>
<br>(A) an integral part of a statewide workforce development system; and
<br>
<br>(B) designed to assess, plan, develop, and provide vocational rehabilitation services for individuals with disabilities, consistent with their strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities, interests, informed choice, and economic self-sufficiency, so that such individuals may prepare for and engage in gainful employment.
<br>(3) Policy
<br>
<br>It is the policy of the United States that such a program shall be carried out in a manner consistent with the following principles:
<br>
<br>(A) Individuals with disabilities, including individuals with the most significant disabilities, are generally presumed to be capable of engaging in gainful employment and the provision of individualized vocational rehabilitation services can improve their ability to become gainfully employed.
<br>
<br>(B) Individuals with disabilities must be provided the opportunities to obtain competitive integrated employment.
<br>
<br>(C) Individuals who are applicants for such programs or eligible to participate in such programs must be active and full partners in the vocational rehabilitation process, making meaningful and informed choices—
<br>
<br>(i) during assessments for determining eligibility and vocational rehabilitation needs; and
<br>
<br>(ii) in the selection of employment outcomes for the individuals, services needed to achieve the outcomes, entities providing such services, and the methods used to secure such services.
<br>
<br>(D) Families and other natural supports can play important roles in the success of a vocational rehabilitation program, if the individual with a disability involved requests, desires, or needs such supports.
<br>
<br>(E) Vocational rehabilitation counselors that are trained and prepared in accordance with State policies and procedures as described in section 721(a)(7)(B) of this title (referred to individually in this subchapter as a "qualified vocational rehabilitation counselor"), other qualified rehabilitation personnel, and other qualified personnel should facilitate the accomplishment of the employment outcomes and objectives of an individual.
<br>
<br>(F) Individuals with disabilities and the individuals' representatives are full partners in a vocational rehabilitation program and must be involved on a regular basis and in a meaningful manner with respect to policy development and implementation.
<br>
<br>(G) Accountability measures must facilitate the accomplishment of the goals and objectives of the program, including providing vocational rehabilitation services to, among others, individuals with the most significant disabilities.
<br>(b) Authorization of appropriations
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>For the purpose of making grants to States under part B to assist States in meeting the costs of vocational rehabilitation services provided in accordance with State plans under section 721 of this title, there are authorized to be appropriated $3,302,053,000 for each of the fiscal years 2015 through 2020, except that the amount to be appropriated for a fiscal year shall not be less than the amount of the appropriation under this paragraph for the immediately preceding fiscal year, increased by the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index determined under subsection (c) for the immediately preceding fiscal year.
<br>(2) Reference
<br>
<br>The reference in paragraph (1) to grants to States under part B shall not be considered to refer to grants under section 732 of this title.
<br>(c) Consumer Price Index
<br>(1) Percentage change
<br>
<br>No later than November 15 of each fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 1979), the Secretary of Labor shall publish in the Federal Register the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index published for October of the preceding fiscal year and October of the fiscal year in which such publication is made.
<br>(2) Application
<br>(A) Increase
<br>
<br>If in any fiscal year the percentage change published under paragraph (1) indicates an increase in the Consumer Price Index, then the amount to be appropriated under subsection (b)(1) for the subsequent fiscal year shall be at least the amount appropriated under subsection (b)(1) for the fiscal year in which the publication is made under paragraph (1) increased by such percentage change.
<br>(B) No increase or decrease
<br>
<br>If in any fiscal year the percentage change published under paragraph (1) does not indicate an increase in the Consumer Price Index, then the amount to be appropriated under subsection (b)(1) for the subsequent fiscal year shall be at least the amount appropriated under subsection (b)(1) for the fiscal year in which the publication is made under paragraph (1).
<br>(3) Definition
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, the term "Consumer Price Index" means the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, published monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
<br>(d) Extension
<br>(1) In general
<br>(A) Authorization or duration of program
<br>
<br>Unless the Congress in the regular session which ends prior to the beginning of the terminal fiscal year—
<br>
<br>(i) of the authorization of appropriations for the program authorized by the State grant program under part B of this subchapter; or
<br>
<br>(ii) of the duration of the program authorized by the State grant program under part B of this subchapter;
<br>
<br>has passed legislation which would have the effect of extending the authorization or duration (as the case may be) of such program, such authorization or duration is automatically extended for 1 additional year for the program authorized by this subchapter.
<br>(B) Calculation
<br>
<br>The amount authorized to be appropriated for the additional fiscal year described in subparagraph (A) shall be an amount equal to the amount appropriated for such program for fiscal year 2003, increased by the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index determined under subsection (c) for the immediately preceding fiscal year, if the percentage change indicates an increase.
<br>(2) Construction
<br>(A) Passage of legislation
<br>
<br>For the purposes of paragraph (1)(A), Congress shall not be deemed to have passed legislation unless such legislation becomes law.
<br>(B) Acts or determinations of Commissioner
<br>
<br>In any case where the Commissioner is required under an applicable statute to carry out certain acts or make certain determinations which are necessary for the continuation of the program authorized by this subchapter, if such acts or determinations are required during the terminal year of such program, such acts and determinations shall be required during any fiscal year in which the extension described in that part of paragraph (1) that follows clause (ii) of paragraph (1)(A) is in effect.
