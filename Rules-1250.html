<br>
<br>(3) The Secretary of the Treasury has also identified an array of entities in the insurance, petroleum, and petrochemicals industries that the Secretary has determined to be owned or controlled by the Government of Iran and added those entities to the list contained in Appendix A to part 560 of title 31, Code of Federal Regulations (commonly known as the "Iranian Transactions Regulations"), thereby prohibiting transactions between United States persons and those entities.

<br>        
<br>§8601. Findings
<br>
<br>Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>(1) Since 1948, United States Presidents and both houses of Congress, on a bipartisan basis and supported by the American people, have repeatedly reaffirmed the special bond between the United States and Israel, based on shared values and shared interests.
<br>
<br>(2) The Middle East is undergoing rapid change, bringing with it hope for an expansion of democracy but also great challenges to the national security of the United States and our allies in the region, particularly to our most important ally in the region, Israel.
<br>
<br>(3) The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran is continuing its decades-long pattern of seeking to foment instability and promote extremism in the Middle East, particularly in this time of dramatic political transition.
<br>
<br>(4) At the same time, the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran continues to enrich uranium in defiance of multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions.
<br>
<br>(5) A nuclear-weapons capable Iran would fundamentally threaten vital United States interests, encourage regional nuclear proliferation, further empower Iran, the world's leading state sponsor of terror, and pose a serious and destabilizing threat to Israel and the region.
<br>
<br>(6) Over the past several years, with the assistance of the Governments of the Islamic Republic of Iran and Syria, Hizbollah and Hamas have increased their stockpile of rockets, with more than 60,000 now ready to be fired at Israel. The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran continues to add to its arsenal of ballistic missiles and cruise missiles, which threaten Iran's neighbors, Israel, and United States Armed Forces in the region.
<br>
<br>(7) As a result, Israel is facing a fundamentally altered strategic environment.
<br>
<br>(8) Pursuant to chapter 5 of title 1 of the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2003 (Public Law 108–11; 117 Stat. 576), the authority to make available loan guarantees to Israel is currently set to expire on September 30, 2012.

<br>Short Title of 2014 Amendment
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 113–296, §1, Dec. 19, 2014, 128 Stat. 4075, provided that: "This Act [enacting section 8606 of this title, amending sections 2321h and 2776 of this title and section 17337 of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare, enacting provisions set out as notes under this section and sections 8602, 8603, and 8606 of this title, and amending provisions set out as a note under section 2776 of this title] may be cited as the 'United States-Israel Strategic Partnership Act of 2014'."
<br>Short Title
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 112–150, §1, July 27, 2012, 126 Stat. 1146, provided that: "This Act [enacting this chapter and amending section 2321h of this title] may be cited as the 'United States-Israel Enhanced Security Cooperation Act of 2012'."
<br>Findings
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 113–296, §2, Dec. 19, 2014, 128 Stat. 4075, provided that: "Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>"(1) The people and the Governments of the United States and of Israel share a deep and unbreakable bond, forged by over 60 years of shared interests and shared values.
<br>
<br>"(2) Today, the people and Governments of the United States and of Israel are facing a dynamic and rapidly changing security environment in the Middle East and North Africa, necessitating deeper cooperation on a range of defense, security, and intelligence matters.
<br>
<br>"(3) From Gaza, Hamas continues to deny Israel's right to exist and persists in firing rockets indiscriminately at population centers in Israel.
<br>
<br>"(4) Hezbollah—with support from Iran—continues to stockpile rockets and may be seeking to exploit the tragic and volatile security situation within Syria.
<br>
<br>"(5) The Government of Iran continues to pose a grave threat to the region and the world at large with its reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons.
<br>
<br>"(6) Given these challenges, it is imperative that the United States continues to deepen cooperation with allies like Israel in pursuit of shared policy objectives."
<br>§8602. Statement of policy
<br>
<br>It is the policy of the United States:
<br>
<br>(1) To reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the security of the State of Israel as a Jewish state. As President Barack Obama stated on December 16, 2011, "America's commitment and my commitment to Israel and Israel's security is unshakeable." And as President George W. Bush stated before the Israeli Knesset on May 15, 2008, on the 60th anniversary of the founding of the State of Israel, "The alliance between our governments is unbreakable, yet the source of our friendship runs deeper than any treaty.".
<br>
<br>(2) To help the Government of Israel preserve its qualitative military edge amid rapid and uncertain regional political transformation.
<br>
<br>(3) To veto any one-sided anti-Israel resolutions at the United Nations Security Council.
<br>
<br>(4) To support Israel's inherent right to self-defense.
<br>
<br>(5) To pursue avenues to expand cooperation with the Government of Israel both in defense and across the spectrum of civilian sectors, including high technology, agriculture, medicine, health, pharmaceuticals, and energy.
<br>
<br>(6) To assist the Government of Israel with its ongoing efforts to forge a peaceful, negotiated settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that results in two states living side-by-side in peace and security, and to encourage Israel's neighbors to recognize Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state.
<br>
<br>(7) To encourage further development of advanced technology programs between the United States and Israel given current trends and instability in the region.

<br>
<br>"(3) to reaffirm the importance of the 2007 United States-Israel Memorandum of Understanding on United States assistance to Israel and the semi-annual Strategic Dialogue between the United States and Israel;
<br>
<br>"(4) to pursue every opportunity to deepen cooperation with Israel on a range of critical issues including defense, homeland security, energy, and cybersecurity;

<br>
<br>"(6) to support the Government of Israel in its ongoing efforts to reach a negotiated political settlement with the Palestinian people that results in two states living side-by-side in peace and security."
<br>Statement of Policy Regarding the Visa Waiver Program
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 113–296, §9, Dec. 19, 2014, 128 Stat. 4077, provided that: "It shall be the policy of the United States to include Israel in the list of countries that participate in the visa waiver program under section 217 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1187) when Israel satisfies, and as long as Israel continues to satisfy, the requirements for inclusion in such program specified in such section."
<br>§8603. United States actions to assist in the defense of Israel and protect United States interests
<br>
<br>It is the sense of Congress that the United States Government should take the following actions to assist in the defense of Israel:
<br>
<br>(1) Seek to enhance the capabilities of the Governments of the United States and Israel to address emerging common threats, increase security cooperation, and expand joint military exercises.
<br>
<br>(2) Provide the Government of Israel such support as may be necessary to increase development and production of joint missile defense systems, particularly such systems that defend against the urgent threat posed to Israel and United States forces in the region.
<br>
<br>(3) Provide the Government of Israel assistance specifically for the production and procurement of the Iron Dome defense system for purposes of intercepting short-range missiles, rockets, and projectiles launched against Israel.
<br>
<br>(4) Provide the Government of Israel defense articles and defense services through such mechanisms as appropriate, to include air refueling tankers, missile defense capabilities, and specialized munitions.
<br>
<br>(5) Provide the Government of Israel additional excess defense articles, as appropriate, in the wake of the withdrawal of United States forces from Iraq.
<br>
<br>(6) Examine ways to strengthen existing and ongoing efforts, including the Gaza Counter Arms Smuggling Initiative, aimed at preventing weapons smuggling into Gaza pursuant to the 2009 agreement following the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, as well as measures to protect against weapons smuggling and terrorist threats from the Sinai Peninsula.
<br>
<br>(7) Offer the Air Force of Israel additional training and exercise opportunities in the United States to compensate for Israel's limited air space.
<br>
<br>(8) Work to encourage an expanded role for Israel with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), including an enhanced presence at NATO headquarters and exercises.
<br>
<br>(9) Expand already-close intelligence cooperation, including satellite intelligence, with Israel.
