<br>(2) Qualified thrift lender
<br>
<br>An insured depository institution that is not a member on January 1, 1989, may become a member of a Federal Home Loan Bank only if—
<br>
<br>(A) the insured depository institution (other than a community financial institution) has at least 10 percent of its total assets in residential mortgage loans;
<br>
<br>(B) the insured depository institution's financial condition is such that advances may be safely made to such institution; and
<br>
<br>(C) the character of its management and its home-financing policy are consistent with sound and economical home financing.
<br>(3) Certain institutions
<br>
<br>An insured depository institution commencing its initial business operations after January 1, 1989, may become a member of a Federal Home Loan Bank if it complies with regulations and orders prescribed by the Director for the 10 percent asset requirement (described in the 2 paragraph (2)) within one year after the commencement of its operations.
<br>(4) Limited exemption for community financial institutions
<br>
<br>A community financial institution that otherwise meets the requirements of paragraph (2) may become a member without regard to the percentage of its total assets that is represented by residential mortgage loans, as described in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (2).
<br>(5) Certain privately insured credit unions
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Subject to the requirements of subparagraph (B), a credit union shall be treated as an insured depository institution for purposes of determining the eligibility of such credit union for membership in a Federal home loan bank under paragraphs (1), (2), and (3).
<br>(B) Certification by appropriate supervisor
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>For purposes of this paragraph and subject to clause (ii), a credit union which lacks Federal deposit insurance and which has applied for membership in a Federal home loan bank may be treated as meeting all the eligibility requirements for Federal deposit insurance only if the appropriate supervisor of the State in which the credit union is chartered has determined that the credit union meets all the eligibility requirements for Federal deposit insurance as of the date of the application for membership.
<br>(ii) Certification deemed valid
<br>
<br>If, in the case of any credit union to which clause (i) applies, the appropriate supervisor of the State in which such credit union is chartered fails to make a determination pursuant to such clause by the end of the 6-month period beginning on the date of the application, the credit union shall be deemed to have met the requirements of clause (i).
<br>(C) Security interests of Federal home loan bank not avoidable
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any provision of State law authorizing a conservator or liquidating agent of a credit union to repudiate contracts, no such provision shall apply with respect to—
<br>
<br>(i) any extension of credit from any Federal home loan bank to any credit union which is a member of any such bank pursuant to this paragraph; or
<br>
<br>(ii) any security interest in the assets of such credit union securing any such extension of credit.
<br>(D) Protection for certain Federal home loan bank advances
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any State law to the contrary, if a Bank makes an advance under section 1430 of this title to a State-chartered credit union that is not federally insured—
<br>
<br>(i) the Bank's interest in any collateral securing such advance has the same priority and is afforded the same standing and rights that the security interest would have had if the advance had been made to a federally insured credit union; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the Bank has the same right to access such collateral that the Bank would have had if the advance had been made to a federally insured credit union.
<br>(b) Location requirement
<br>
<br>An institution eligible to become a member under this section may become a member only of, or secure advances from, the Federal Home Loan Bank of the district in which is located the institution's principal place of business, or of the bank of a district adjoining such district, if demanded by convenience and then only with the approval of the Director.
<br>(c) Inspection and regulation requirements
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding the provisions of clause (2) of subsection (a) of this section requiring inspection and regulation under law as a condition with respect to eligibility for membership, any building and loan association which would be eligible to become a member of a Federal Home Loan Bank except for the fact that it is not subject to inspection and regulation under the banking laws or similar laws of the State in which such association is organized shall, upon subjecting itself to such inspection and regulation as the Director shall prescribe, be eligible to become a member.

<br>§1426. Capital structure of Federal home loan banks
<br>(a) Regulations
<br>(1) Capital standards
<br>
<br>Not later than 18 months after November 12, 1999, the Director shall issue regulations prescribing uniform capital standards applicable to each Federal home loan bank, which shall require each such bank to meet—
<br>
<br>(A) the leverage requirement specified in paragraph (2); and
<br>
<br>(B) the risk-based capital requirements, in accordance with paragraph (3).
<br>(2) Leverage requirement
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The leverage requirement shall require each Federal home loan bank to maintain a minimum amount of total capital based on the total assets of the bank and shall be 5 percent.
<br>(B) Treatment of stock and retained earnings
<br>
<br>In determining compliance with the minimum leverage ratio established under subparagraph (A), the paid-in value of the outstanding Class B stock and the amount of retained earnings shall be multiplied by 1.5, and such higher amounts shall be deemed to be capital for purposes of meeting the 5 percent minimum leverage ratio, except that a Federal home loan bank's total capital (determined without taking into account any such multiplier) shall not be less than 4 percent of the total assets of the bank.
<br>(3) Risk-based capital standards
<br>(A) Risk-based capital standards
<br>
<br>The Director shall, by regulation, establish risk-based capital standards for the Federal Home Loan Banks to ensure that the Federal Home Loan Banks operate in a safe and sound manner, with sufficient permanent capital and reserves to support the risks that arise in the operations and management of the Federal Home Loans Banks.
<br>(B) Consideration of other risk-based standards
<br>
<br>In establishing the risk-based standard under subparagraph (A), the Director shall take due consideration of any risk-based capital test established pursuant to section 1361 of the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 (12 U.S.C. 4611) for the enterprises (as defined in that Act [12 U.S.C. 4501 et seq.]), with such modifications as the Director determines to be appropriate to reflect differences in operations between the Federal home loan banks and those enterprises.
<br>(4) Other regulatory requirements
<br>
<br>The regulations issued by the Director under paragraph (1) shall—
<br>
<br>(A) permit each Federal home loan bank to issue, with such rights, terms, and preferences, not inconsistent with this chapter and the regulations issued hereunder, as the board of directors of that bank may approve, any 1 or more of—
<br>
<br>(i) Class A stock, which shall be redeemable in cash and at par 6 months following submission by a member of a written notice of its intent to redeem such shares; and
<br>
<br>(ii) Class B stock, which shall be redeemable in cash and at par 5 years following submission by a member of a written notice of its intent to redeem such shares;
<br>
<br>(B) provide that the stock of a Federal home loan bank may be issued to and held by only members of the bank, and that a bank may not issue any stock other than as provided in this section;
<br>
<br>(C) prescribe the manner in which stock of a Federal home loan bank may be sold, transferred, redeemed, or repurchased; and
<br>
<br>(D) provide the manner of disposition of outstanding stock held by, and the liquidation of any claims of the Federal home loan bank against, an institution that ceases to be a member of the bank, through merger or otherwise, or that provides notice of intention to withdraw from membership in the bank.
<br>(5) Definitions of capital
<br>
<br>For purposes of determining compliance with the capital standards established under this subsection—
<br>
<br>(A) permanent capital of a Federal home loan bank shall include—
<br>
<br>(i) the amounts paid for the Class B stock; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the retained earnings of the bank (as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles); and
<br>
<br>(B) total capital of a Federal home loan bank shall include—
<br>
<br>(i) permanent capital;
<br>
<br>(ii) the amounts paid for the Class A stock;
<br>
<br>(iii) consistent with generally accepted accounting principles, and subject to the regulation of the Director, a general allowance for losses, which may not include any reserves or allowances made or held against specific assets; and
<br>
<br>(iv) any other amounts from sources available to absorb losses incurred by the bank that the Director determines by regulation to be appropriate to include in determining total capital.
<br>(6) Transition period
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the requirements relating to purchase and retention of capital stock of a Federal home loan bank by any member thereof in effect on the day before November 12, 1999, shall continue in effect with respect to each Federal home loan bank until the regulations required by this subsection have taken effect and the capital structure plan required by subsection (b) has been approved by the Director and implemented by such bank.
<br>(b) Capital structure plan
<br>(1) Approval of plans
<br>
<br>Not later than 270 days after the date of publication by the Director of final regulations in accordance with subsection (a), the board of directors of each Federal home loan bank shall submit for approval by the Director a plan establishing and implementing a capital structure for such bank that—
<br>
<br>(A) the board of directors determines is best suited for the condition and operation of the bank and the interests of the members of the bank;

<br>
<br>The capital structure plan of each Federal home loan bank shall impose a continuing obligation on the board of directors of the bank to review and adjust the minimum investment required of each member of that bank, as necessary to ensure that the bank remains in compliance with applicable minimum capital levels established by the Director, and shall require each member to comply promptly with any adjustments to the required minimum investment.
<br>(2) Transition rule
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The capital structure plan of each Federal home loan bank shall specify the date on which it shall take effect, and may provide for a transition period of not longer than 3 years to allow the bank to come into compliance with the capital requirements prescribed under subsection (a), and to allow any institution that was a member of the bank on November 12, 1999, to come into compliance with the minimum investment required pursuant to the plan.

<br>(4) Classes of stock
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The capital structure plan of a Federal home loan bank shall afford each member of that bank the option of maintaining its required investment in the bank through the purchase of any combination of classes of stock authorized by the board of directors of the bank and approved by the Director in accordance with its regulations.
<br>(B) Rights requirement

<br>
<br>The capital structure plan of a Federal home loan bank shall provide for the liquidation in an orderly manner, as determined by the bank, of any claim of that bank against a member, including claims for any applicable prepayment fees or penalties resulting from prepayment of advances prior to stated maturity.

<br>
<br>Before filing a capital structure plan with the Director, each Federal home loan bank shall conduct a review of the plan by—
<br>
<br>(A) an independent certified public accountant, to ensure, to the extent possible, that implementation of the plan would not result in any write-down of the redeemable bank stock investment of its members; and
<br>
<br>(B) at least one major credit rating agency, to determine, to the extent possible, whether implementation of the plan would have any material effect on the credit ratings of the bank.
<br>(d) Termination of membership
<br>(1) Voluntary withdrawal
<br>
<br>Any member may withdraw from a Federal home loan bank if the member provides written notice to the bank of its intent to do so and if, on the date of withdrawal, there is in effect a certification by the Director that the withdrawal will not cause the Federal Home Loan Bank System to fail to meet its obligation under section 1441b(f)(2)(C) of this title to contribute to the debt service for the obligations issued by the Resolution Funding Corporation. The applicable stock redemption notice periods shall commence upon receipt of the notice by the bank. Upon the expiration of the applicable notice period for each class of redeemable stock, the member may surrender such stock to the bank, and shall be entitled to receive in cash the par value of the stock. During the applicable notice periods, the member shall be entitled to dividends and other membership rights commensurate with continuing stock ownership.
<br>(2) Involuntary withdrawal
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The board of directors of a Federal home loan bank may terminate the membership of any institution if, subject to regulations of the Director, it determines that—
<br>
<br>(i) the member has failed to comply with a provision of this chapter or any regulation prescribed under this chapter; or
<br>
<br>(ii) the member has been determined to be insolvent, or otherwise subject to the appointment of a conservator, receiver, or other legal custodian, by a Federal or State authority with regulatory and supervisory responsibility for the member.
<br>(B) Stock disposition
<br>
<br>An institution, the membership of which is terminated in accordance with subparagraph (A)—

<br>
<br>(iii) shall not be entitled to any other rights or privileges accorded to members after the date of the termination.
<br>(C) Commencement of notice period
<br>
<br>With respect to an institution, the membership of which is terminated in accordance with subparagraph (A), the applicable notice period under subsection (a)(4) for each class of redeemable stock shall commence on the earlier of—
<br>
<br>(i) the date of such termination; or
<br>
<br>(ii) the date on which the member has provided notice of its intent to redeem such stock.
<br>(3) Liquidation of indebtedness
<br>
<br>Upon the termination of the membership of an institution for any reason, the outstanding indebtedness of the member to the bank shall be liquidated in an orderly manner, as determined by the bank and, upon the extinguishment of all such indebtedness, the bank shall return to the member all collateral pledged to secure the indebtedness.

<br>(2) Excess stock
<br>
<br>Shares of stock held by a member shall not be deemed to be "excess stock" for purposes of this subsection by virtue of a member's submission of a notice of intent to withdraw from membership or termination of its membership in any other manner.
<br>(3) Priority
<br>
<br>A Federal home loan bank may not redeem any excess Class B stock prior to the end of the 5-year notice period, unless the member has no Class A stock outstanding that could be redeemed as excess.
<br>(f) Impairment of capital
<br>
<br>If the Director or the board of directors of a Federal home loan bank determines that the bank has incurred or is likely to incur losses that result in or are expected to result in charges against the capital of the bank, the bank shall not redeem or repurchase any stock of the bank without the prior approval of the Director while such charges are continuing or are expected to continue. In no case may a bank redeem or repurchase any applicable capital stock if, following the redemption, the bank would fail to satisfy any minimum capital requirement.
<br>(g) Rejoining after divestiture of all shares
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in paragraph (2), and notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, an institution that divests all shares of stock in a Federal home loan bank may not, after such divestiture, acquire shares of any Federal home loan bank before the end of the 5-year period beginning on the date of the completion of such divestiture, unless the divestiture is a consequence of a transfer of membership on an uninterrupted basis between banks.
<br>(2) Exception for withdrawals from membership before 1998
<br>
<br>Any institution that withdrew from membership in any Federal home loan bank before December 31, 1997, may acquire shares of a Federal home loan bank at any time after that date, subject to the approval of the Director and the requirements of this chapter.
<br>(h) Treatment of retained earnings

<br>
<br>The holders of the Class B stock of a Federal home loan bank shall own the retained earnings, surplus, undivided profits, and equity reserves, if any, of the bank.
<br>(2) Exception
<br>
<br>Except as specifically provided in this section or through the declaration of a dividend or a capital distribution by a Federal home loan bank, or in the event of liquidation of the bank, a member shall have no right to withdraw or otherwise receive distribution of any portion of the retained earnings of the bank.
<br>(3) Limitation
<br>
<br>A Federal home loan bank may not make any distribution of its retained earnings unless, following such distribution, the bank would continue to meet all applicable capital requirements.

<br>(4) Definitions
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:
<br>(A) Independent director
<br>
<br>The terms "independent director" and "independent directorship" mean a member of the board of directors of a Federal Home Loan Bank who is a bona fide resident of the district in which the Federal Home Loan Bank is located, or the directorship held by such a person, respectively.
<br>(B) Member director
<br>
<br>The terms "member director" and "member directorship" mean a member of the board of directors of a Federal Home Loan Bank who is an officer or director of a member institution that is located in the district in which the Federal Home Loan Bank is located, or the directorship held by such a person, respectively.
<br>(b) Directorships
<br>(1) Member directorships
<br>
<br>Each member directorship shall be designated by the Director as representing the members located in a particular State, and shall be filled by a person who is an officer or director of a member located in that State, each of which members shall be entitled to nominate an eligible person for such directorship, and such office shall be filled from such nominees by a plurality of the votes which such members may cast in an election held for the purpose of filling such office, in which election each such member may cast for such office a number of votes equal to the number of shares of stock in such bank required by this chapter to be held by such member at the end of the calendar year next preceding the election, as determined pursuant to regulation of the Director, but not in excess of the average number of shares of stock in such bank required by this chapter to be held at the end of such calendar year by the respective members of such bank located in such State, as so determined. No person who is an officer or director of a member that fails to meet any applicable capital requirement is eligible to hold the office of Federal Home Loan Bank director. As used in this subsection and in subsection (c) of this section, the term "member" means a member of a Federal home loan bank which was a member of such bank at the end of such calendar year.
<br>(2) Independent directorships
<br>(A) Elections
<br>
<br>Each independent director—
<br>
<br>(i) shall be elected by the members entitled to vote, from among eligible persons nominated, after consultation with the Advisory Council of the Bank, by the board of directors of the Bank; and
<br>
<br>(ii) shall be elected by a plurality of the votes of the members of the Bank at large, with each member having the number of votes for each such directorship as it has under paragraph (1) in an election to fill member directorships.
<br>(B) Criteria
<br>
<br>Nominees shall meet all applicable requirements prescribed in this section.
<br>(C) Nomination and election procedures
<br>
<br>Procedures for nomination and election of independent directors shall be prescribed by the bylaws of each Federal Home Loan Bank, in a manner consistent with the rules and regulations of the Agency.
<br>(c) Apportionment among States in bank district; designation of State location
<br>
<br>The number of member directorships designated as representing the members located in each separate State in a bank district shall be determined by the Director in the approximate ratio of the percentage of the required stock, as determined pursuant to regulation of the Director, of the members located in that State at the end of the calendar year next preceding the date of the election to the total required stock, as so determined, of all members of such bank at the end of such year, except that in the case of each State such number shall not be less than one and shall not be more than six. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, (A) except as provided in clause (B) of this sentence, if at any time the number of member directorships so designated as representing the members located in any State would not be at least equal to the total number of elective directorships which, on December 31, 1960, were filled by officers or directors of members whose principal places of business were located in such State, the Director shall add to the board of directors of the bank of the district in which such State is located such number of member directorships, and shall so designate the directorship or directorships thus added, that the number of member directorships designated as representing the members located in such State will equal said total number, and (B) clause (A) of this sentence shall not apply to the directorships of any Federal Home Loan Bank resulting from the merger of any 2 or more such Banks. Any member directorship so added shall exist only until the expiration of its first term. The Director shall, with respect to each member of a Federal home loan bank, designate the State in the district of such bank in which such member shall, for the purposes of this subsection and subsection (b) of this section, be deemed to be located, and may from time to time change any such designation, but if the principal place of business of any such member is located in a State of such district it shall be the duty of the Director to designate such State as the State in which such member shall, for said purposes, be deemed to be located. As used in the second sentence of this subsection, the term "total number of elective directorships" means the total number of elective directorships on the board of directors of the bank of the district in which such State was located on December 31, 1960, and the term "members" where used for the second time in such sentence means members of such bank.
<br>(d) Terms; rules and regulations governing nominations and elections
<br>
<br>The term of each director shall be 4 years. The board of directors of each Federal home loan bank and the Director shall adjust the terms of members first elected after July 30, 2008, to ensure that the terms of the members of the board of directors are staggered with approximately ¼ of the terms expiring each year. If any person, before or after, or partly before and partly after, September 8, 1961, has been elected to each of three consecutive full terms as a director of a Federal home loan bank and has served for all or part of each of said terms, such person shall not be eligible for election to a directorship of such bank for a term which begins earlier than two years after the expiration of the last expiring of said three terms. The Director is authorized to prescribe such rules and regulations as it may deem necessary or appropriate for the nomination and election of directors of Federal home loan banks, including, without limitation on the generality of the foregoing, rules and regulations with respect to the breaking of ties and with respect to the inclusion of more than one directorship on a single ballot and the methods of voting and of determining the results of voting in such cases.
<br>(e) Continuation of existing terms; directorship for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico
<br>
<br>Each term, outstanding on the effective date of the amendment to this section abolishing the division of elective directors into classes, of an elective or appointive directorship then existing shall continue until its original date of expiration, and any elective or appointive directorship in existence on said date shall continue to exist to the same extent as if it had been established by or under this section on or after said date. The Director in its 1 discretion may shorten the next succeeding term of any such elective directorship to one year, and may fill such term by appointment. The term "States" or "State" as used in this section shall mean the States of the Union, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The Director, by regulation or otherwise, may add an additional elective directorship to the board of directors of the bank of any district in which the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is included at the time such directorship is added and which does not then include five or more States, may fix the commencement and the duration, which shall not exceed two years, of the initial term of any directorship so added, and may fill any such initial term by appointment: Provided, That (1) any directorship added pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this sentence shall be designated by the Director, pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, as representing the members located in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, (2) such designation of such directorship shall not be changed, and (3) such directorship shall automatically cease to exist if and when the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico ceases to be included in such district.

<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>A Bank director elected to fill a vacancy shall be elected for the unexpired term of his or her predecessor in office.
<br>(2) Election process
<br>
<br>In the event of a vacancy in any Bank directorship, such vacancy shall be filled by an affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining Bank directors, regardless of whether such remaining Bank directors constitute a quorum of the Bank's board of directors. A Bank director so elected shall satisfy the requirements for eligibility which were applicable to his predecessor. If any Bank director shall cease to have any qualification set forth in this section, the office held by such person shall immediately become vacant, and such person shall not continue to act as a Bank director.
<br>(g) Chairperson and Vice Chairperson

<br>(h) Appointment where members hold less than $1,000,000 of capital stock
<br>
<br>If at any time when nominations are required members shall hold less than $1,000,000 of the capital stock of the Federal home loan bank, the Director shall appoint a director or directors to fill the place or places for which such nominations are required, and the Director may, prior to the filing of the certificate mentioned in section 1432 of this title, appoint directors who shall be respectively designated by it as appointive directors and as member directors, in accordance with the provisions of this section.
