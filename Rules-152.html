<br>Subsection (a) is based on former section 633(3) (less last 10 words). The regulation-making power conferred by that section covers the power conferred by former section 633(2)7 (last 17 words) which is, therefore, omitted. The requirement of notice is preserved in section 3304. The words "through its members or the examiners" are omitted as unnecessary in view of section 1104. The authority of the President to prescribe rules, based on former section 633(1) is carried into sections 2951, 3302, 3304(a), 3306(a), 3321, 7152, 7153, 7321, and 7322 of this title.

The first 76 words of former section 851 are added here to preserve the general statement of policy in the light of which the substantive provisions that formerly comprised the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944 are to be interpreted. See Elder v. Brannan, 241 U.S. 277, 286. In subsection (b), the words "in the competitive service in Executive agencies, permanent or temporary, and in the government of the District of Columbia", and in subsection (c) the words "in the excepted service in Executive agencies, permanent or temporary, and in the government of the District of Columbia" are coextensive with and substituted for "in civilian positions in all establishments, agencies, bureaus, administrations, projects, and departments of the Government, permanent or temporary, and in either (a) the classified civil service; (b) the unclassified civil service; (c) any temporary or emergency establishment, agency, bureau, administration, project, and department created by Acts of Congress or Presidential Executive order", in view of the exclusion of positions in the legislative and judicial branches by former section 869.

The words "the provisions of this title that relate to the administration of the competitive service" will include some of the sections derived from the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944 (former sections 851–869). They are based in part on former section 860 (codified in §1302(c)). The authorization in that section to make and enforce regulations for the competitive service would include the authority to investigate and report. The words "and other employees" are substituted for "and its own subordinates, and those in the public service" in view of the definition of "employee" in section 2105.

<br>§1304. Loyalty investigations; reports; revolving fund
<br>
<br>(a) The Office of Personnel Management shall conduct the investigations and issue the reports required by the following statutes—
<br>
<br>(1) sections 272b, 281b(e), and 290a of title 22;
<br>
<br>(2) section 1874(c) of title 42; and
<br>
<br>(3) section 1203(e) of title 6, District of Columbia Code.
<br>
<br>(b) When an investigation under subsection (a) of this section develops data indicating that the loyalty of the individual being investigated is questionable, the Office shall refer the matter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for a full field investigation, a report of which shall be furnished to the Office for its information and appropriate action.
<br>
<br>(c) When the President considers it in the national interest, he may have the investigations of a group or class, which are required by subsection (a) of this section, made by the Federal Bureau of Investigation rather than the Office.
<br>
<br>(d) The investigation and report required by subsection (a) of this section shall be made by the Federal Bureau of Investigation rather than the Office for those specific positions which the Secretary of State certifies are of a high degree of importance or sensitivity.
<br>
<br>(e)(1) A revolving fund is available, to the Office without fiscal year limitation, for financing investigations, training, and such other functions as the Office is authorized or required to perform on a reimbursable basis, including personnel management services performed at the request of individual agencies (which would otherwise be the responsibility of such agencies), or at the request of nonappropriated fund instrumentalities, and for the cost of audits, investigations, and oversight activities, conducted by the Inspector General of the Office, of the fund and the activities financed by the fund. However, the functions which may be financed in any fiscal year by the fund are restricted to those functions which are covered by the budget estimates submitted to the Congress for that fiscal year. To the maximum extent feasible, each individual activity shall be conducted generally on an actual cost basis over a reasonable period of time.
<br>
<br>(2) The capital of the fund consists of the aggregate of—
<br>
<br>(A) appropriations made to provide capital for the fund, which appropriations are hereby authorized, and
<br>
<br>(B) the sum of the fair and reasonable value of such supplies, equipment, and other assets as the Office from time to time transfers to the fund (including the amount of the unexpended balances of appropriations or funds relating to activities the financing of which is transferred to the fund) less the amount of related liabilities, the amount of unpaid obligations, and the value of accrued annual leave of employees, which are attributable to the activities the financing of which is transferred to the fund.
<br>
<br>(3) The fund shall be credited with—
<br>
<br>(A) advances and reimbursements from available funds of the Office or other agencies, or from other sources, for those services and supplies provided at rates estimated by the Office as adequate to recover expenses of operation (including provision for accrued annual leave of employees and depreciation of equipment); and
<br>
<br>(B) receipts from sales or exchanges of property, and payments for loss of or damage to property, accounted for under the fund.
<br>
<br>(4) Any unobligated and unexpended balances in the fund which the Office determines to be in excess of amounts needed for activities financed by the fund shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States as miscellaneous receipts.
<br>
<br>(5)(A) The Office shall prepare a business-type budget providing full disclosure of the results of operations for each of the functions performed by the Office and financed by the fund, and such budget shall be transmitted to the Congress and considered, in the manner prescribed by law for wholly owned Government corporations.
<br>
<br>(B) Such budget shall include an estimate from the Inspector General of the Office of the amount required to pay the expenses to audit, investigate, and provide other oversight activities with respect to the fund and the activities financed by the fund.
<br>
<br>(C) The amount requested by the Inspector General under subparagraph (B) shall not exceed .33 percent of the total budgetary authority requested by the Office under subparagraph (A).
<br>
<br>(6) The Comptroller General of the United States shall, as a result of his periodic reviews of the activities financed by the fund, report and make such recommendations as he deems appropriate to the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service of the House of Representatives.
<br>
<br>(f) An agency may use available appropriations to reimburse the Office or the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the cost of investigations, training, and functions performed for them under this section, or to make advances toward their cost. These advances and reimbursements shall be credited directly to the applicable appropriations of the Office or the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
<br>
<br>(g) This section does not affect the responsibility of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to investigate espionage, sabotage, or subversive acts.

In subsection (a), the reference to section 10(b)(5)(B)(i) and (B)(ii) of the Act of August 1, 1946 (60 Stat. 766) is omitted because of the amendment of the Act of April 5, 1952, by the Act of July 31, 1953, ch. 283, 67 Stat. 240, and the reenactment of the provisions of the Act of April 5, 1952, insofar as they relate to the Atomic Energy Commission as section 145 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (68 Stat. 942; 42 U.S.C. 2165). The references to section 1(2) of the Act of May 22, 1947 (61 Stat. 125), section 1 of the joint resolution of May 21, 1947 (61 Stat. 125), and section 110(c) of the Act of April 3, 1948 (62 Stat. 137) are omitted as these Acts were repealed by the Act of Aug. 26, 1954, ch. 937 §542(a) (1), (2), and (4), 68 Stat. 861. Reference to section 510 of the Mutual Security Act of 1951 (65 Stat. 381) is omitted because this section was replaced by section 531 of the Mutual Security Act of 1954 (68 Stat. 859) and the latter was repealed by the Act of Sept. 4, 1961, Pub. L. 87–195, §642(2), 75 Stat. 460.
<br>
<br>In subsection (d), the references to section 10(b)(5)(B)(i) and (ii) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946, section 510 of the Mutual Security Act of 1951, a majority of the members of the Atomic Energy Commission, and the Director of Mutual Security (which was changed to Director of the International Cooperation Administration on authority of section 8 of 1953 Reorg. Plan No. 7, 67 Stat. 641, and Executive Order 10610 of May 9, 1955) are omitted because of the disposition of the two sections as explained with reference to subsection (a).

<br>§1506. Orders; withholding loans or grants; limitations
<br>
<br>(a) When the Merit Systems Protection Board finds—
<br>
<br>(1) that a State or local officer or employee has not been removed from his office or employment within 30 days after notice of a determination by the Board that he has violated section 1502 of this title and that the violation warrants removal; or
<br>
<br>(2) that the State or local officer or employee has been removed and has been appointed within 18 months after his removal to an office or employment in the same State (or in the case of the District of Columbia, in the District of Columbia) in a State or local agency which does not receive loans or grants from a Federal agency;
<br>
<br>the Board shall make and certify to the appropriate Federal agency an order requiring that agency to withhold from its loans or grants to the State or local agency to which notice was given an amount equal to 2 years' pay at the rate the officer or employee was receiving at the time of the violation. When the State or local agency to which appointment within 18 months after removal has been made is one that receives loans or grants from a Federal agency, the Board order shall direct that the withholding be made from that State or local agency.
<br>
<br>(b) Notice of the order shall be sent by registered or certified mail to the State or local agency from which the amount is ordered to be withheld. After the order becomes final, the Federal agency to which the order is certified shall withhold the amount in accordance with the terms of the order. Except as provided by section 1508 of this title, a determination or order of the Board becomes final at the end of 30 days after mailing the notice of the determination or order.
<br>
<br>(c) The Board may not require an amount to be withheld from a loan or grant pledged by a State or local agency as security for its bonds or notes if the withholding of that amount would jeopardize the payment of the principal or interest on the bonds or notes.

<br>§1507. Subpenas and depositions
<br>
<br>(a) The Merit Systems Protection Board may require by subpena the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of documentary evidence relating to any matter before it as a result of this chapter. Any member of the Board may sign subpenas, and members of the Board and its examiners when authorized by the Board may administer oaths, examine witnesses, and receive evidence. The attendance of witnesses and the production of documentary evidence may be required from any place in the United States at the designated place of hearing. In case of disobedience to a subpena, the Board may invoke the aid of a court of the United States in requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of documentary evidence. In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpena issued to a person, the United States District Court within whose jurisdiction the inquiry is carried on may issue an order requiring him to appear before the Board, or to produce documentary evidence if so ordered, or to give evidence concerning the matter in question; and any failure to obey the order of the court may be punished by the court as a contempt thereof.
<br>
<br>(b) The Board may order testimony to be taken by deposition at any stage of a proceeding or investigation before it as a result of this chapter. Depositions may be taken before an individual designated by the Board and having the power to administer oaths. Testimony shall be reduced to writing by the individual taking the deposition, or under his direction, and shall be subscribed by the deponent. Any person may be compelled to appear and depose and to produce documentary evidence before the Board as provided by this section.
<br>
<br>(c) A person may not be excused from attending and testifying or from producing documentary evidence or in obedience to a subpena on the ground that the testimony or evidence, documentary or otherwise, required of him may tend to incriminate him or subject him to a penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any transaction, matter, or thing concerning which he is compelled to testify, or produce evidence, documentary or otherwise, before the Board in obedience to a subpena issued by it. A person so testifying is not exempt from prosecution and punishment for perjury committed in so testifying.

<br>§1508. Judicial review
<br>
<br>A party aggrieved by a determination or order of the Merit Systems Protection Board under section 1504, 1505, or 1506 of this title may, within 30 days after the mailing of notice of the determination or order, institute proceedings for review thereof by filing a petition in the United States District Court for the district in which the State or local officer or employee resides. The institution of the proceedings does not operate as a stay of the determination or order unless—
<br>
<br>(1) the court specifically orders a stay; and
<br>
<br>(2) the officer or employee is suspended from his office or employment while the proceedings are pending.
<br>
<br>A copy of the petition shall immediately be served on the Board, and thereupon the Board shall certify and file in the court a transcript of the record on which the determination or order was made. The court shall review the entire record including questions of fact and questions of law. If application is made to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence, and it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that the additional evidence may materially affect the result of the proceedings and that there were reasonable grounds for failure to adduce this evidence in the hearing before the Board, the court may direct that the additional evidence be taken before the Board in the manner and on the terms and conditions fixed by the court. The Board may modify its findings of fact or its determination or order in view of the additional evidence and shall file with the court the modified findings, determination, or order; and the modified findings of fact, if supported by substantial evidence, are conclusive. The court shall affirm the determination or order, or the modified determination or order, if the court determines that it is in accordance with law. If the court determines that the determination or order, or the modified determination or order, is not in accordance with law, the court shall remand the proceeding to the Board with directions either to make a determination or order determined by the court to be lawful or to take such further proceedings as, in the opinion of the court, the law requires. The judgment and decree of the court are final, subject to review by the appropriate United States Court of Appeals as in other cases, and the judgment and decree of the court of appeals are final, subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States on certiorari or certification as provided by section 1254 of title 28. If a provision of this section is held to be invalid as applied to a party by a determination or order of the Board, the determination or order becomes final and effective as to that party as if the provision had not been enacted.
