In the case of disobedience to a subpoena authorized under subsection (a), the committee may request the Attorney General of the United States to invoke the aid of any district or territorial court of the United States in requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of documentary evidence. Such court, within the jurisdiction of which such inquiry is carried on, may, in case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena issued to any individual, partnership, corporation, association, organization, or other entity, issue an order requiring such individual or entity to appear before the committee, or to produce documentary evidence if so ordered or to give evidence concerning the matter in question. Any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof.

Any individual, partnership, corporation, association, organization, or other entity may be compelled to appear and be deposed and to produce documentary evidence in the same manner as witnesses may be compelled to appear and testify and produce documentary evidence before the committee, as provided in this section.

<br>§4587. Identification of industries facing subsidized imports
<br>(a) Petitions
<br>
<br>Any entity, including a trade association, firm, certified or recognized union, or group of workers, that is representative of a United States industry and has reason to believe—
<br>
<br>(1) that—
<br>
<br>(A) as a result of implementation of provisions of the USMCA, the industry is likely to face increased competition from subsidized imports, from a USMCA country, with which it directly competes; or
<br>
<br>(B) the industry is likely to face increased competition from subsidized imports with which it directly competes from any other country designated by the President, following consultations with the Congress, as benefiting from a reduction of tariffs or other trade barriers under a trade agreement that enters into force with respect to the United States after January 1, 1994; and
<br>
<br>(2) that the industry is likely to experience a deterioration of its competitive position before more effective rules and disciplines relating to the use of government subsidies have been developed with respect to the country concerned;
<br>
<br>may file with the Trade Representative a petition that such industry be identified under this section.
<br>(b) Identification of industry
<br>
<br>Within 90 days after receipt of a petition under subsection (a), the Trade Representative, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, shall decide whether to identify the industry on the basis that there is a reasonable likelihood that the industry may face both the subsidization described in subsection (a)(1) and the deterioration described in subsection (a)(2).
<br>(c) Action after identification
<br>
<br>At the request of an entity that is representative of an industry identified under subsection (b), the Trade Representative shall—
<br>
<br>(1) compile and make available to the industry information under section 2418 of this title;
<br>
<br>(2) recommend to the President that an investigation by the International Trade Commission be requested under section 332 of the Tariff Act of 1930 [19 U.S.C. 1332]; or
<br>
<br>(3) take actions described in both paragraphs (1) and (2).
<br>
<br>The industry may request the Trade Representative to take appropriate action to update (as often as annually) any information obtained under paragraph (1) or (2), or both, as the case may be, until an agreement on more effective rules and disciplines relating to government subsidies is reached between the United States and the USMCA countries.
<br>(d) Initiation of action under other law
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Trade Representative and the Secretary of Commerce shall review information obtained under subsection (c) and consult with the industry identified under subsection (b) with a view to deciding whether any action is appropriate—
<br>
<br>(A) under section 2411 of this title, including the initiation of an investigation under section 2412(c) of this title (in the case of the Trade Representative); or
<br>
<br>(B) under subtitle A of title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930 [19 U.S.C. 1671 et seq.], including the initiation of an investigation under section 702(a) of that Act [19 U.S.C. 1671a(a)] (in the case of the Secretary of Commerce).
<br>(2) Criteria for initiation
<br>
<br>In determining whether to initiate any investigation under section 2411 of this title or any other trade law, other than title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930 [19 U.S.C. 1671 et seq.], the Trade Representative, after consultation with the Secretary of Commerce—
<br>
<br>(A) shall seek the advice of the advisory committees established under section 2155 of this title;
<br>
<br>(B) shall consult with the Committee on Finance of the Senate and the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives;
<br>
<br>(C) shall coordinate with the interagency organization established under section 1872 of this title; and
<br>
<br>(D) may ask the President to request advice from the International Trade Commission.
<br>(3) Title III actions
<br>
<br>In the event an investigation is initiated under section 2412(c) of this title as a result of a review under this subsection and the Trade Representative, following such investigation (including any applicable dispute settlement proceedings under the USMCA or any other trade agreement), determines to take action under section 2411(a) of this title, the Trade Representative shall give preference to actions that most directly affect the products that benefit from governmental subsidies and were the subject of the investigation, unless there are no significant imports of such products or the Trade Representative otherwise determines that application of the action to other products would be more effective.
<br>(e) Effect of decisions
<br>
<br>Any decision, whether positive or negative, or any action by the Trade Representative or the Secretary of Commerce under this section shall not in any way—
<br>
<br>(1) prejudice the right of any industry to file a petition under any trade law;
<br>
<br>(2) prejudice, affect, or substitute for, any proceeding, investigation, determination, or action by the Secretary of Commerce, the International Trade Commission, or the Trade Representative pursuant to such a petition; or
<br>
<br>(3) prejudice, affect, substitute for, or obviate any proceeding, investigation, or determination under section 2411 of this title, title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930 [19 U.S.C. 1671 et seq.], or any other trade law.
<br>(f) Standing
