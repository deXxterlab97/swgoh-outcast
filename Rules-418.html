<br>(B) Certain payments in contemplation of an event
<br>
<br>Any payment which would be a golden parachute payment but for the fact that such payment was made before the date referred to in subparagraph (A)(ii) shall be treated as a golden parachute payment if the payment was made in contemplation of the occurrence of an event described in any subclause of such subparagraph.

<br>

<br>(ii) Notice of termination
<br>
<br>After written notification from the Attorney General to the Board of such a conviction, the Board shall issue to such insured credit union a notice of its intention to terminate the insured status of the insured credit union and schedule a hearing on the matter, which shall be conducted as a termination hearing pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, except that no period for correction shall apply to a notice issued under this subparagraph.
<br>(B) Conviction of title 31 offenses
<br>
<br>If a credit union is convicted of any criminal offense under section 5322 or 5324 of title 31 after prior written notification from the Attorney General, the Board may initiate proceedings to terminate the insured status of such credit union in the manner described in subparagraph (A).
<br>(C) Notice to State supervisor
<br>
<br>The Board shall simultaneously transmit a copy of any notice under this paragraph to the appropriate State financial institutions supervisor.
<br>(2) Factors to be considered
<br>
<br>In determining whether to terminate insurance under paragraph (1), the Board shall take into account the following factors:

<br>(A) The extent to which directors, committee members, or senior executive officers (as defined by the Board in regulations which the Board shall prescribe) of the credit union knew of, or were involved in, the commission of the money laundering offense of which the credit union was found guilty.
<br>
<br>(B) The extent to which the offense occurred despite the existence of policies and procedures within the credit union which were designed to prevent the occurrence of any such offense.
<br>
<br>(C) The extent to which the credit union has fully cooperated with law enforcement authorities with respect to the investigation of the money laundering offense of which the credit union was found guilty.
<br>
<br>(D) The extent to which the credit union has implemented additional internal controls (since the commission of the offense of which the credit union was found guilty) to prevent the occurrence of any other money laundering offense.
<br>
<br>(E) The extent to which the interest of the local community in having adequate deposit and credit services available would be threatened by the termination of insurance.
<br>(3) Notice to State credit union supervisor and public
<br>
<br>When the order to terminate insured status initiated pursuant to this subsection is final, the Board shall—
<br>
<br>(A) notify the commission, board, or authority (if any) having supervision of the credit union described in paragraph (1) at least 10 days prior to the effective date of the order of the termination of the insured status of such credit union; and
<br>
<br>(B) publish notice of the termination of the insured status of the credit union.
<br>(4) Temporary insurance of previously insured deposits
<br>
<br>Upon termination of the insured status of any State credit union pursuant to paragraph (1), the deposits of such credit union shall be treated in accordance with subsection (d)(2).
<br>(5) Successor liability
<br>
<br>This subsection shall not apply to a successor to the interests of, or a person who acquires, an insured credit union that violated a provision of law described in paragraph (1), if the successor succeeds to the interests of the violator, or the acquisition is made, in good faith and not for purposes of evading this subsection or regulations prescribed under this subsection.
<br>(w) One-year restrictions on Federal examiners of insured credit unions
<br>(1) In general
<br>

<br>
<br>(B) served 2 or more months during the final 12 months of his or her employment with the Administration as the senior examiner (or a functionally equivalent position) of an insured credit union with continuing, broad responsibility for the examination (or inspection) of that insured credit union on behalf of the Administration; and
<br>
<br>(C) within 1 year after the termination date of his or her service or employment with the Administration, knowingly accepts compensation as an employee, officer, director, or consultant from such insured credit union.
<br>(2) Rule of construction
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subsection, a person shall be deemed to act as a consultant for an insured credit union only if such person directly works on matters for, or on behalf of, such insured credit union.
<br>(3) Regulations
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The Board shall prescribe rules or regulations to administer and carry out this subsection, including rules, regulations, or guidelines to define the scope of persons referred to in paragraph (1)(B).

<br>(4) Waiver
<br>
<br>The Board may grant a waiver, on a case by case basis, of the restriction imposed by this subsection to any officer or employee (including any special Government employee) of the Administration if the Chairman certifies in writing that granting the waiver would not affect the integrity of the supervisory program of the Administration.
<br>(5) Penalties
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>In addition to any other administrative, civil, or criminal remedy or penalty that may otherwise apply, whenever the Board determines that a person subject to paragraph (1) has become associated, in the manner described in paragraph (1)(C), with an insured credit union, the Board shall impose upon such person one or more of the following penalties:
<br>(i) Industry-wide prohibition order
<br>
<br>The Board shall serve a written notice or order in accordance with and subject to the provisions of subsection (g)(4) for written notices or orders under paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (g), upon such person of the intention of the Board—
<br>
<br>(I) to remove such person from office or to prohibit such person from further participation in the conduct of the affairs of the insured credit union for a period of up to 5 years; and

<br>
<br>Any person subject to an order issued under this subparagraph (A)(i) shall be subject to paragraphs (5) and (7) of subsection (g) in the same manner and to the same extent as a person subject to an order issued under subsection (g).

<br>
<br>(B) Not later than 10 days after the date on which the Board closes a credit union for liquidation pursuant to paragraph (1), or accepts appointment as liquidating agent pursuant to subsection (b), such insured credit union may apply to the United States district court for the judicial district in which the principal office of such insured credit union is located or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, for an order requiring the Board to show cause why it should not be prohibited from continuing such liquidation.
