<br>
<br>(1) has certified to the Secretary, as a condition of obtaining the insurance of a blanket mortgage under this subsection, that upon completion of the multifamily project covered by such mortgage it intends to commit the ownership of the multifamily project to a plan of family unit ownership under which each family unit would be eligible for individual mortgage insurance under subsection (c) and will faithfully and diligently make and carry out all reasonable efforts to establish such plan of family unit ownership and to sell such family units to purchasers approved by the Secretary; and
<br>
<br>(2) may, in the Secretary's discretion, be regulated or restricted as to rents, charges, capital structure, rate of return, and methods of operation until the termination of all obligations of the Secretary under the insurance and during such further period of time as the Secretary shall be the owner, holder or reinsurer of the mortgage. The Secretary may make such contracts with and acquire for not to exceed $100 such stock or interest in such mortgagor as he may deem necessary to render effective any such regulation or restriction of such mortgagor. The stock or interest acquired by the Secretary shall be paid for out of the General Insurance Fund, and shall be redeemed by the mortgagor at par at any time upon the request of the Secretary after the termination of all obligations of the Secretary under the insurance.

<br>
<br>(3)(A) not to exceed, for such part of the project as may be attributable to dwelling use (excluding exterior land improvements as defined by the Secretary), $42,048 per family unit without a bedroom, $48,481 per family unit with one bedroom, $58,469 per family unit with two bedrooms, $74,840 per family unit with three bedrooms, and $83,375 per family unit with four or more bedrooms; except that as to projects to consist of elevator-type structures the Secretary may, in his discretion, increase the dollar amount limitations per family unit to not to exceed $44,250 per family unit without a bedroom, $50,724 per family unit with one bedroom, $61,680 per family unit with two bedrooms, $79,793 per family unit with three bedrooms, and $87,588 per family unit with four or more bedrooms, as the case may be, to compensate for the higher costs incident to the construction of elevator-type structures of sound standards of construction and design; (B) the Secretary may, by regulation, increase any of the dollar limitations in subparagraph (A) (as such limitations may have been adjusted in accordance with section 1712a of this title) by not to exceed 170 percent in any geographical area where the Secretary finds that cost levels so require and by not to exceed 170 percent, or 215 percent in high cost areas, where the Secretary determines it necessary on a project-by-project basis, but in no case may any such increase exceed 90 percent where the Secretary determines that a mortgage purchased or to be purchased by the Government National Mortgage Association in implementing its special assistance functions under section 1720 1 of this title (as such section existed immediately before November 30, 1983) is involved; and
<br>
<br>(4) not to exceed an amount equal to the sum of the unit mortgage amounts determined under the provisions of subsection (c) assuming the mortgagor to be the owner and occupant of each family unit.
<br>(f) Amortization of blanket mortgages of multifamily projects; interest; releases; extent of project
<br>
<br>Any blanket mortgage insured under subsection (d) shall provide for complete amortization by periodic payments within such terms as the Secretary may prescribe but not to exceed 40 years from the beginning of amortization of the mortgage, and shall bear interest at such rate as may be agreed upon by the mortgagor and the mortgagee. The Secretary may consent to the release of a part or parts of the mortgaged property from the lien of the blanket mortgage upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe and the blanket mortgage may provide for such release. The project covered by the blanket mortgage may include four or more family units and such commercial and community facilities as the Secretary deems adequate to serve the occupants.
<br>(g) Entitlement to insurance benefits as provided in section 1710(a) of this title

<br>(j) Increase in maximum insurance amounts for costs incurred from solar energy systems and energy conservation measures
<br>
<br>The Secretary may further increase the dollar amount limitations which would otherwise apply under subsection (e) by not to exceed 20 per centum if such increase is necessary to account for the increased cost of a project due to the installation therein of a solar energy system (as defined in subparagraph (3) of the last paragraph of section 1703(a) of this title) or residential energy conservation measures (as defined in section 8211(11)(A) through (G) and (I) of title 42) 1 in cases where the Secretary determines that such measures are in addition to those required under the minimum property standards and will be cost-effective over the life of the measure.

<br>§1715z. Homeownership or membership in cooperative association for lower income families
<br>(a) Authorization for periodic assistance payments to mortgagees; assistance to manufactured home buyers
<br>
<br>(1) For the purpose of assisting lower income families in acquiring homeownership or in acquiring membership in a cooperative association operating a housing project, the Secretary is authorized to make, and to contract to make, periodic assistance payments on behalf of such homeowners and cooperative members. The assistance shall be accomplished through payments to mortgagees holding mortgages meeting the special requirements specified in this section or which mortgages are assisted under a State or local program providing assistance through loans, loan insurance or tax abatement. In making such assistance available, the Secretary shall give preference to low-income families who, without such assistance, would be likely to be involuntarily displaced (including those who would be likely to be displaced from rental units which are to be converted into a condominium project or a cooperative project). Such assistance may include the acquisition of a condominium or a membership in a cooperative association.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Secretary is authorized to make periodic assistance payments under this section on behalf of families whose incomes do not exceed the maximum income limits prescribed pursuant to subsection (h)(2) of this section for the purpose of assisting such families in acquiring ownership of a manufactured home consisting of two or more modules and a lot on which such manufactured home is or will be situated, except that periodic assistance payments pursuant to this paragraph shall not be made with respect to more than 20 per centum of the total number of units with respect to which assistance is approved under this section after January 1, 1976. Assistance payments under this section pursuant to this paragraph shall be accomplished through payments on behalf of an owner of lower-income of a manufactured home as described in the preceding sentence to the financial institution which makes the loan, advance of credit, or purchase of an obligation representing the loan or advance of credit to finance the purchase of the manufactured home and the lot on which such manufactured home is or will be situated, but only if insurance under section 1703 of this title covering such loan, advance of credit, or obligation has been granted to such institution.
<br>
<br>(B) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (c) of this section, assistance payments provided pursuant to this paragraph shall be in an amount not exceeding the lesser of—
<br>
<br>(i) the balance of the monthly payment for principal, interest, real and personal property taxes, insurance, and insurance premium chargeable under section 1703 of this title due under the loan or advance of credit remaining unpaid after applying 20 per centum of the manufactured homeowner's income; or
<br>
<br>(ii) the difference between the amount of the monthly payment for principal, interest, and insurance premium chargeable under section 1703 of this title which the manufactured homeowner is obligated to pay under the loan or advance of credit and the monthly payment of principal and interest which the owner would be obligated to pay if the loan or advance of credit were to bear interest at a rate derived by subtracting from the interest rate applicable to such loan or advance of credit the interest rate differential between the maximum interest rate plus mortgage insurance premium applicable to mortgages insured under subsection (i) of this section at the time such loan or advance of credit is made and the interest rate which such mortgages are presumed, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, to bear for purposes of subsection (c)(2) of this section.
<br>(b) Qualifications and eligibility requirements for assistance payments
<br>
<br>To qualify for assistance payments, the homeowner or the cooperative member shall be of lower income and satisfy eligibility requirements prescribed by the Secretary, and—
<br>
<br>(1) the homeowner shall be a mortgagor under a mortgage which meets the requirements of and is insured under subsection (i) or (j)(4) of this section: Provided, That a mortgage meeting the requirements of subsection (i)(3)(A) of this section but insured under section 1715z–2 of this title may qualify for assistance payments if such mortgage was executed by a mortgagor who is determined not to be an acceptable credit risk for mortgage insurance purposes (but otherwise eligible) under subsection (j)(4) of this section or under section 1715l(d)(2) or 1715y(c) of this title and accepted as a reasonably satisfactory credit risk under section 1715z–2 1 of this title; or
<br>
<br>(2) the cooperative association of which the family is a member shall operate (A) a housing project the construction or substantial rehabilitation of which has been financed with a mortgage insured under section 1715e or section 1715l(d)(3) of this title and which has been completed within two years prior to the filing of the application for assistance payments and the dwelling unit has had no previous occupant other than the family: Provided, That if any cooperative member who has received assistance payments transfers his membership and occupancy rights to another person who satisfies the eligibility requirements prescribed by the Secretary and undertakes the obligation to pay occupancy charges, the new cooperative member may qualify for assistance payments upon the filing of an application with respect to the dwelling unit involved to be occupied by him: Provided further, That assistance payments may be made with respect to a dwelling unit in an existing cooperative project which meets such standards as the Secretary may prescribe, if the family qualifies as a displaced family as defined in section 1715l(f) of this title, or a family which includes five or more minor persons, or a family occupying low-rent public housing: Provided further, That the amount of the mortgage attributable to the dwelling unit shall involve a principal obligation not in excess of $40,000 ($47,500 in any geographical area where the Secretary authorizes an increase on the basis of a finding that costs levels so require), except that with respect to any family with five or more persons the foregoing limits shall be $47,500 and $55,000, respectively; or (B) a housing project which is financed under a State or local program providing assistance through loans, loan insurance, or tax abatements, and which prior to completion of construction or rehabilitation is approved for receiving the benefits of this section.
<br>(c) Limitation on payments on behalf of mortgagor; occupancy of property; maximum amount of payment; recapture of amounts; determination, applicability, etc.
<br>
<br>(1) Subject to the second sentence of this paragraph, the assistance payments to a mortgagee by the Secretary on behalf of a mortgagor shall be made during such time as the mortgagor shall continue to occupy the property which secures the mortgage: Provided, That assistance payments may be made on behalf of a homeowner who assumes a mortgage insured under subsection (i) or (j)(4) with respect to which assistance payments have been made on behalf of the previous owner, if the homeowner is approved by the Secretary as eligible for receiving such assistance: Provided further, That the Secretary is authorized to continue making such assistance payments where the mortgage has been assigned to the Secretary. Assistance payments pursuant to any new contract, other than a contract in connection with a refinancing under subsection (r), entered into after September 30, 1983, that utilizes authority approved in appropriation Acts for any fiscal year beginning after such date may not be made for more than a 10-year period. The payment shall be in an amount not exceeding the lesser of—
<br>
<br>(A) the balance of the monthly payment for principal, interest, taxes, insurance, and mortgage insurance premium due under the mortgage remaining unpaid after applying 20 per centum of the mortgagor's income; or
<br>
<br>(B) the difference between the amount of the monthly payment for principal, interest and mortgage insurance premium which the mortgagor is obligated to pay under the mortgage and the monthly payment for principal and interest which the mortgagor would be obligated to pay if the mortgage were to bear interest at the rate of 1 per centum per annum (4 per centum per annum in the case of a mortgage described in subsection (o)).
<br>
<br>(2)(A) Upon disposition by the homeowner of any property assisted pursuant to this section or where the homeowner rents such a property (or the owner's unit in the case of a two- to four-family property) for a period longer than one year, the Secretary shall provide for the recapture of an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the amount of assistance actually received under this section, other than any amount provided under subsection (e), or (ii) an amount equal to at least 50 per centum of the net appreciation of the property, as determined by the Secretary. For the purpose of this paragraph, the term "net appreciation of the property" means any increase in the value of the property over the original purchase price, less the reasonable costs of sale, the reasonable costs of improvements made to the property, and any increase in the mortgage amount as of the time of sale over the original mortgage balance due to the mortgage being insured pursuant to section 1715z–10 1 of this title. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any such assistance shall constitute a debt secured by the property to the extent that the Secretary may provide for such recapture.
<br>
<br>(B) Subparagraph (A) does not apply to any property with respect to which there is assumption in accordance with paragraph (1) of this subsection or to any property which is subject to a mortgage, loan, or other advance of credit insured pursuant to subsection (q).
<br>
<br>(3)(A) There hereby is established in the Treasury of the United States a fund, which, to the extent approved in appropriation Acts, may be used by the Secretary for purposes of carrying out subparagraph (B). There shall be deposited into such fund (i) any amount recaptured under paragraph (2); (ii) any authority to make assistance payments under subsection (a) that is committed for use in a contract but is unused because the mortgage, loan, or advance of credit involved is refinanced (except to the extent provided in subsection (r) for mortgages insured under such subsection) or because such assistance payments are terminated or suspended for other reasons before the original termination date of such contract; and (iii) any amount received under subparagraph (C).
<br>
<br>(B) In the case of any homeowner whose assistance payments are terminated by reason of the 10-year limitation referred to in paragraph (1), and who is determined by the Secretary to be unable to assume the full payments due under the mortgage, loan, or advance of credit involved, the Secretary shall, to the extent of the availability of amounts in the fund established in subparagraph (A), contract to make, and make, continued assistance payments on behalf of such homeowner. Such continued assistance payments shall be made in an amount determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of paragraph (1) or subsection (a)(2)(B) and for such period as the Secretary determines to be appropriate.
<br>
<br>(C) Any amounts in such fund determined by the Secretary to be in excess of the amounts currently required to carry out the provisions of subparagraph (B) shall be invested by the Secretary in obligations of, or obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by, the United States or any agency of the United States. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any amounts of budget authority or contract authority recaptured from assistance payments contracts relating to mortgages that are being refinanced that are not required for assistance payments contracts relating to mortgages insured under this subsection, shall be rescinded.
<br>(d) Limitation on payments on behalf of family holding membership in cooperative association; occupancy; maximum amount of payment
<br>
<br>Assistance payments to a mortgagee by the Secretary on behalf of a family holding membership in a cooperative association operating a housing project shall be made only during such time as the family is an occupant of such project and shall be in amounts computed on the basis of the formula set forth in subsection (c) applying the cooperative member's proportionate share of the obligations under the project mortgage to the items specified in the formula.
<br>(e) Reimbursement for expenses in handling the mortgage
<br>
<br>The Secretary may include in the payment to the mortgagee such amount, in addition to the amount computed under subsection (a)(2)(B), (c), (d), (j)(7), or (r), as he deems appropriate to reimburse the mortgagee for its expenses in handling the mortgage.
<br>(f) Adoption of procedures for recertifications of mortgagor's or cooperative member's income
<br>
<br>Procedures shall be adopted by the Secretary for recertifications of the mortgagor's (or cooperative member's) income at intervals of two years (or at shorter intervals where the Secretary deems it desirable) for the purpose of adjusting the amount of such assistance payments within the limits of the formula described in subsection (c).
<br>(g) Regulations to assure that sales price or other consideration paid is not increased above appraised value
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as he deems necessary to assure that the sales price of, or other consideration paid in connection with, the purchase by a homeowner of the property with respect to which assistance payments are to be made is not increased above the appraised value on which the maximum mortgage which the Secretary will insure is computed.
<br>(h) Authorization of appropriations; aggregate amount of assistance payment contracts; maximum income limits of families; limitation on payments with respect to existing dwellings or dwelling units in existing projects and for approved substantial rehabilitation of dwellings or dwelling units in projects
<br>
<br>(1) There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section, including such sums as may be necessary to make the assistance payments under contracts entered into under this section. The aggregate amount of outstanding contracts to make such payments shall not exceed amounts approved in appropriation Acts, and payments pursuant to such contracts shall not exceed $75,000,000 per annum prior to July 1, 1969, which maximum dollar amount shall be increased by $125,000,000 on July 1, 1969, by $150,000,000 on July 1, 1970, by $200,000,000 on July 1, 1971, by such sums as may be approved in appropriation Acts after June 30, 1974, and prior to July 1, 1976, and by such sums as may be approved in an appropriation Act on or after October 1, 1983 (from the additional authority to enter into contracts made available on such date under the first sentence of section 1437c(c)(1) of title 42). The aggregate amount that may be obligated over the duration of the contracts entered into with the authority provided on or after October 1, 1983 (other than obligations in connection with mortgages insured under subsection (r)), may not exceed such sums of new budget authority as may be appropriated after November 30, 1983. The Secretary shall begin issuing new commitments and reservations to provide mortgage insurance and assistance payments under this section before the expiration of the 30-day period following the approval in any appropriation Act of budget authority for this section after November 30, 1983. Upon the expiration of one year following August 22, 1974, the Secretary shall not enter into new contracts for assistance payments under this section utilizing authority approved in appropriation Acts prior to July 1, 1974. The Secretary shall not enter into new contracts for assistance payments under this section (except under subsection (r)) after May 20, 1983, utilizing amounts approved in appropriation Acts before November 30, 1983, except (i) pursuant to a firm commitment issued on or before May 20, 1983, (ii) pursuant to other commitments issued by the Secretary prior to June 30, 1981, reserving funds for housing to be assisted under this section  where  such  housing  is  included  in  a project pursuant to section 119 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 [42 U.S.C. 5318], or (iii) pursuant to other commitments issued on or before September 30, 1981, where housing under this section is to be developed on land which was municipally owned on September 30, 1981, and where a local government contributes at least $1,000 per unit of funds obtained under title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 [42 U.S.C. 5301 et seq.] and at least $2,000 per unit of additional funds to assist housing under this section. In no event may the Secretary enter into any new contract for assistance payments under this section (other than a contract in connection with a mortgage insured under subsection (r)) after September 30, 1989.
<br>
<br>(2) Assistance payments under this section may be made only with respect to a family whose income at the time of initial occupancy does not exceed 95 per centum of the median income for the area, as determined by the Secretary with adjustments for smaller and larger families, except that the Secretary may establish income ceilings higher or lower than 95 per centum of the median for the area on the basis of his findings that such variations are necessary because of prevailing levels of construction costs, unusually high or low median family incomes, or other factors.
<br>
<br>(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (b)(2) and (i)(3)(A) with respect to the prior construction or rehabilitation of a dwelling, or of the project in which there is a dwelling unit, for which assistance payments may be made, and notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (j)(1) authorizing the purchase of housing which is neither deteriorating nor substandard, not more than—
<br>

<br>
<br>(B) 30 per centum of the total additional amount of contracts for assistance payments authorized by appropriation Acts to be made on or after July 1, 1969,
<br>
<br>may be made with respect to existing dwellings, or dwelling units in existing projects. The preceding sentence shall not apply to contracts in connection with mortgages insured under subsection (r).
<br>
<br>(4) At least 10 per centum of the total amount of contracts for assistance payments authorized by appropriation Acts to be made after June 30, 1971, shall be available for use only with respect to dwellings, or dwelling units in projects, which are approved by the Secretary prior to substantial rehabilitation.

Commitments for the insurance of such mortgages may be issued by the Secretary prior to the date of their execution or disbursement thereon, upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe.
<br>

<br>

<br>(F) bear interest at a rate not to exceed such percent per annum on the amount of the principal obligation outstanding at any time as the Secretary finds necessary to meet the mortgage market, taking into consideration the yields on mortgages in the primary and secondary markets.
<br>
<br>(4) In insuring eligible mortgages under this subsection, the Secretary may not deny insurance on the basis that a mortgage involves a two- to three-family dwelling or is to be used to finance substantial rehabilitation rather than new construction.
<br>
<br>(5) As a condition of insuring a mortgage on a two- to three-family dwelling, the Secretary shall require the mortgagor (A) not to discriminate against prospective tenants on the basis of their receipt of or eligibility for housing assistance under any Federal, State or local housing assistance program and (B) to agree that during the term of the mortgage each of the rental units shall be occupied by, or available for occupancy by, persons and families whose incomes do not exceed 100 per centum of the area median income.

<br>(4)(A) No mortgage shall be insured under paragraph (1) unless the mortgagor enters into an agreement, satisfactory to the Secretary, that it will offer to sell the dwellings involved, after purchase and upon completion of any rehabilitation, to lower income individuals or families meeting the eligibility requirements established by the Secretary under subsection (b).
<br>
<br>(B) The Secretary is authorized to insure under this paragraph mortgages executed to finance the sale of individual dwellings to lower income purchasers as provided in subparagraph (A). Any such mortgage shall—

<br>
<br>(D) Upon the sale under this paragraph of any individual dwelling, such dwelling shall be released from the lien of the blanket mortgage. Until all of the individual dwellings in the property covered by the blanket mortgage have been sold, the mortgagor shall hold and operate the dwellings remaining unsold at any given time, in such manner and under such terms as the Secretary may prescribe, as though they constituted rental units.
<br>
<br>(E) Upon the sale under this paragraph of all the individual dwellings in the property covered by the blanket mortgage and the release of all individual dwellings from the lien of the blanket mortgage, the insurance of the blanket mortgage shall be terminated and no adjusted premium charge shall be charged by the Secretary upon such termination.
<br>
<br>(5) Where the Secretary has approved a plan of family unit ownership the terms "single-family dwelling", "single-family dwellings", "individual dwelling", and "individual dwellings" shall mean a family unit or family units, together with the undivided interest (or interests) in the common areas and facilities.
<br>
<br>(6) For purposes of this subsection, the terms "single-family dwelling" and "single-family dwellings" (except for purposes of paragraph (5)) shall include a two- to three-family dwelling which has been approved by the Secretary.
<br>
<br>(7) In addition to the assistance payments authorized under subsection (b), the Secretary may make such payments to a mortgagee on behalf of a nonprofit organization or public body or agency which is a mortgagor under the provisions of paragraph (1) in an amount not exceeding the difference between the monthly payment for principal, interest, and mortgage insurance premium which the mortgagor is obligated to pay under the mortgage and the monthly payment for principal and interest such mortgagor would be obligated to pay if the mortgage were to bear interest at the rate of 1 per centum per annum.
<br>
<br>(8) A mortgage covering property which is not deteriorating or substandard may be insured under this subsection only if it is situated in an area in which mortgages may be insured under section 1715l(h) of this title.
<br>
<br>(9) In insuring eligible mortgages under this subsection, the Secretary may not deny insurance on the basis that a mortgage involves a two- to three-family dwelling or is to be used to finance substantial rehabilitation rather than new construction.
<br>(k) Allocation and transfer of reasonable portion of total authority to contract to make assistance payments to Secretary of Agriculture for use in rural areas and small towns
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall from time to time allocate and transfer to the Secretary of Agriculture, for use (in accordance with the terms and conditions of this section) in rural areas and small towns, a reasonable portion of the total authority to contract to make assistance payments as approved in appropriation Acts under subsection (h)(1).
<br>(l) Deductions for minors in determining income limits; exclusion of earnings of minors
<br>
<br>In determining the income of any person for the purposes of this section, there shall be deducted an amount equal to $300 for each minor person who is a member of the immediate family of such person and living with such family, and the earnings of any such minor person shall not be included in the income of such person or his family.
<br>(m) Termination date for insurance of mortgages

<br>No mortgage (except a mortgage insured under subsection (r)) shall be insured under this section after September 30, 1989, except pursuant to a commitment to insure before that date.
<br>(n) Percentage limitation of mortgage insurance on subdivision units; exceptions
<br>
<br>No mortgage may be insured under this section on a unit in a subdivision, after October 12, 1977, which, when added to any other mortgages insured under this section in that subdivision after such date, represents more than 40 per centum of the total number of units in the subdivision, except that the preceding limitation shall not apply with regard to any rehabilitated unit, or to any unit or subdivision located or to be located in an established urban neighborhood or area, where a sound proposal is involved and where an aggregation of subsidized units is essential to a community sponsored overall redevelopment plan, as determined by the Secretary or to a mortgage insured under subsection (r).
<br>(o) Mortgage insurance over maximum limits involving dwellings of community sponsored programs of concentrated redevelopment or revitalization
<br>
<br>The Secretary may insure a mortgage under this section involving a principal obligation which exceeds, by not more than 20 per centum, the maximum limits specified under subsection (b)(2) or (i)(3) of this section if the mortgage relates to a dwelling in an urban neighborhood where the Secretary determines that a community sponsored program of concentrated redevelopment or revitalization is being undertaken and the Secretary determines that such action is necessary to enable eligible families residing in the area who occupy substandard housing or are being involuntarily displaced to remain in the area in decent, safe, and sanitary housing.
<br>(p) Mortgage insurance over maximum limits involving dwellings to be occupied by physically handicapped persons; applicability, etc.
<br>
<br>The Secretary may insure a mortgage under this section involving a principal obligation which exceeds, by not more than 10 per centum, the maximum limits specified under subsection (b)(2) or (i)(3) of this section, or, if applicable, the maximum principal obligation insurable pursuant to subsection (o) of this section, if the mortgage relates to a dwelling to be occupied by a physically handicapped person and the Secretary determines that such action is necessary to reflect the cost of making such dwelling accessible to and usable by such person.
<br>(q) Periodic assistance payments for emergency stimulation of housing market; contracts, terms and conditions, eligibility, etc., for payments
<br>
<br>(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, except subsection (n), if the Secretary determines that there is a substantial need for emergency stimulation of the housing market, the Secretary is authorized to make and enter into contracts to make periodic assistance payments, to the extent of not to exceed 75 per centum of the authority available pursuant to subsection (h)(1), on behalf of homeowners, including owners of manufactured homes, to mortgagees or other lenders holding mortgages, loans, or advances of credit which meet the requirements of this subsection. The Secretary may establish such criteria, terms, and conditions relating to homeowners and mortgages, loans, or advances of credit assisted under this subsection as the Secretary deems appropriate, consistent with the provisions of this subsection. The Secretary is authorized to insure a mortgage which meets the requirements of and is to be assisted under this subsection. The authority to enter into contracts to provide assistance payments and to insure mortgages under this subsection shall terminate on September 30, 1989, or at such earlier date as the Secretary may deem appropriate, upon a determination by the Secretary that the conditions which gave rise to the exercise of authority under this subsection are no longer present, except pursuant to a commitment entered into prior to such date.

<br>
<br>(B) has a family income, at the time of initial occupancy, which does not exceed 130 per centum of the area median income for the area (with adjustments for smaller and larger families, unusually high or low median family income, or other factors), as determined by the Secretary.
<br>
<br>(3) Assistance payments to a mortgagee or other lender by the Secretary on behalf of a homeowner shall be made only during such time as the homeowner shall continue to occupy the property which secures the mortgage, loan, or advance of credit. The Secretary may, where a mortgage insured under this subsection has been assigned to the Secretary, continue making such assistance payments.
<br>
<br>(4) The amount of the assistance payments in the case of a mortgage shall not at any time exceed the lesser of—
<br>
<br>(A) the balance of the monthly payment for principal, interest, taxes, insurance, and any mortgage insurance premium due under the mortgage remaining unpaid after applying a minimum of 25 per centum of the mortgagor's income, except that the Secretary may reduce such per centum of income to the extent he deems necessary, but not lower than 20 per centum of the mortgagor's income; or
<br>
<br>(B) the difference between the amount of the monthly payment for principal, interest, and any mortgage insurance premium which would be required if the mortgage were a level payment mortgage bearing interest at a rate equal to the maximum interest rate which is applicable to level payment mortgages insured under section 1709(b) of this title, other than mortgages subject to section 1709–1(2) 1 of this title, and the monthly payment for principal and interest which the mortgagor would be obligated to pay if the mortgage were a level payment mortgage bearing interest at the rate of at least 9½ per centum per annum.
<br>
<br>(5) Assistance payments on behalf of the owner of a manufactured home shall not at any time exceed the lesser of—
<br>
<br>(A) the balance of the monthly payment for principal, interest, real and personal property taxes, insurance, and insurance premium chargeable under section 1703 of this title due under the loan or advance of credit remaining unpaid after applying a minimum of 25 per centum of the manufactured homeowner's income, except that the Secretary may reduce such per centum of income to the extent he deems necessary, but not lower than 20 per centum of the mortgagor's income; or
<br>
<br>(B) the difference between the amount of the monthly payment for principal, interest, and insurance premium chargeable under section 1703 of this title which the manufactured homeowner is obligated to pay under the loan or advance of credit and the monthly payment of principal and interest which the owner would be obligated to pay if the loan or advance of credit were to bear an interest rate determined by the Secretary which shall not be less than 12 per centum per annum.
<br>
<br>(6) The Secretary may include in the payment to the mortgagee or other lender such amount, in addition to the amount computed under paragraph (4) or (5), as the Secretary deems appropriate to reimburse the mortgagee or other lender for its reasonable and necessary expenses in handling the mortgage, loan, or advance of credit.
<br>
<br>(7) The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as the Secretary deems necessary to assure that the sales price of, or other consideration paid in connection with, the purchase by a homeowner of the property with respect to which assistance payments are to be made is not greater than the appraised value as determined by the Secretary.
<br>
<br>(8) Assistance payments pursuant to paragraph (5) shall not be made with respect to more than 20 per centum of the total number of units with respect to which assistance is approved under this subsection.
<br>
<br>(9) The Secretary may, in addition to mortgages insured under subsection (i) or (j), insure, upon application by the mortgagee, a mortgage executed by a mortgagor who meets the eligibility requirements for assistance payments prescribed by the Secretary under paragraph (2). Commitments for the insurance of such mortgages may be issued by the Secretary prior to the date of their execution or disbursement thereon, upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe.
<br>
<br>(10) To be eligible for insurance under this subsection, a mortgage shall—
<br>
<br>(A) be a first lien on real estate held in fee simple, or on a leasehold under a lease which meets terms and conditions established by the Secretary;
<br>
<br>(B) have been made to, and be held by, a mortgagee approved by the Secretary as responsible and able to service the mortgage properly;
<br>
<br>(C) involve a one- to four-family dwelling which has been approved by the Secretary prior to the beginning of construction, or if not so approved, has been completed within one year prior to the filing of the application for insurance and which has never been sold other than to the mortgagor;
<br>
<br>(D) involve a principal residence the sales price of which does not exceed 82 per centum of the applicable maximum principal obligation of a mortgage which may be insured in the area pursuant to section 1709(b)(2) of this title, determined without regard to the last sentence of such section;
<br>
<br>(E) have maturity and amortization provisions satisfactory to the Secretary;
<br>

<br>(H) contain such other terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe.
<br>
<br>(11) The Secretary shall, to the extent practicable, insure mortgages under this subsection which are secured by properties which contribute to the conservation of land and energy resources.
<br>
<br>(12) A mortgage to be assisted under this subsection shall, where the Secretary deems it appropriate, provide for graduated payments pursuant to section 1715z–10 1 of this title.
<br>
<br>(13) The Secretary shall develop and utilize a system to allocate assistance under this subsection in a manner which assures a reasonable distribution of such assistance among the various regions of the country and which takes into consideration such factors as population, relative decline in building permits, the need for increased housing production, and other factors he deems appropriate. Assistance provided under this subsection shall not be subject to section 1439 of title 42.
<br>
<br>(14) Upon the disposition by the homeowner of any property assisted pursuant to this subsection, or where the homeowner rents the property (or the owner's unit in the case of a two- to four-family residence) for a period longer than one year, the Secretary shall provide for the recapture of an amount equal to the lesser of (A) the amount of assistance actually received under this subsection, other than any amount provided under paragraph (6), or (B) an amount at least equal to 50 per centum of the net appreciation of the property, as determined by the Secretary. For the purpose of this paragraph, the term "net appreciation of the property" means any increase in the value of the property over the original purchase price, less the reasonable costs of sale, the reasonable costs of improvements made to the property, and any increase in the mortgage balance as of the time of sale over the original mortgage balance due to the mortgage being insured pursuant to section 1715z–10 1 of this title. In providing for such recapture, the Secretary shall include incentives for the homeowner to maintain the property in a marketable condition. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any such assistance shall constitute a debt secured by the property to the extent that the Secretary may provide for such recapture.
<br>
<br>(15) Procedures shall be adopted by the Secretary for recertification of the homeowner's income at intervals of two years (or at shorter intervals where the Secretary deems it desirable) for the purpose of adjusting the amount of such assistance payments within the limits of the formula described in paragraph (4) or (5).

<br>
<br>(i) for not less than 99 years which is renewable; or
<br>
<br>(ii) having a period of not less than 10 years to run beyond the maturity date of the mortgage;

<br>
<br>(F) meet the criteria for refinancing as determined by the Secretary.
<br>
<br>(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (h)(2), assistance payments in connection with mortgages insured under paragraph (2) shall be made only with respect to a family who is eligible for, and receiving assistance payments with respect to, the insured mortgage being refinanced.
<br>
<br>(4) The Secretary is authorized and, to the extent provided in appropriation Acts, may pay to the mortgagor (directly, through the mortgagee, or otherwise)—

<br>
<br>(5) Amounts of budget authority required for assistance payments contracts with respect to mortgages insured under this subsection shall be derived from amounts recaptured from assistance payments contracts relating to mortgages that are being refinanced. For purposes of subsection (c)(3)(A), the amount of recaptured budget authority that the Secretary commits for assistance payments contracts relating to mortgages insured under this subsection shall not be construed as "unused".
<br>
<br>(6) The Secretary is authorized to take any actions to identify and communicate with any mortgagor of a mortgage insured under this section to implement the refinancing of such mortgages with insurance under this subsection. The Secretary may take such actions directly, or under contract. Notwithstanding the restriction of section 552a(b) of title 5, upon the request of an approved mortgagee, the Secretary may disclose to such mortgagee the name and address of any mortgagor of a mortgage insured under this section that meets the criteria for refinancing, pursuant to paragraph (2)(F), and the unpaid principal balance and interest rate on such mortgage.
<br>
<br>(7) The Secretary shall implement the provisions of this subsection by a notice published in the Federal Register.

<br>1 See References in Text note below.
<br>§1715z–1. Rental and cooperative housing for lower income families
<br>(a) Authorization for periodic interest reduction payments on behalf of owner of rental housing project
<br>
<br>For the purpose of reducing rentals for lower income families, the Secretary is authorized to make, and to contract to make, periodic interest reduction payments on behalf of the owner of a rental housing project designed for occupancy by lower income families, which shall be accomplished through payments to morgagees 1 holding mortgages meeting the special requirements specified in this section.
<br>(b) Restrictions on payments; payments with respect to projects financed under State or local programs; mortgage insurance premium
<br>
<br>Interest reduction payments with respect to a project shall only be made during such time as the project is operated as a rental housing project and is subject to a mortgage which meets the requirements of, and is insured under, subsection (j) of this section: Provided, That the Secretary is authorized to continue making such interest reduction payments where the mortgage has been assigned to the Secretary: Provided further, That interest reduction payments may be made with respect to a mortgage or part thereof on a rental or cooperative housing project owned by a private nonprofit corporation or other private nonprofit entity, a limited dividend corporation or other limited dividend entity, public 2 entity, or a cooperative housing corporation, which is financed under a State or local program providing assistance through loans, loan insurance, or tax abatements, and which may involve either new or existing construction and which is approved for receiving the benefits of this section. The term "mortgage insurance premium", when used in this section in relation to a project financed by a loan under a State or local program, means such fees and charges, approved by the Secretary, as are payable by the mortgagor to the State or local agency mortgagee to meet reserve requirements and administrative expenses of such agency.
<br>(c) Amount of payments
<br>
<br>The interest reduction payments to a mortgagee by the Secretary on behalf of a project owner shall be in an amount not exceeding the difference between the monthly payment for principal, interest, and mortgage insurance premium which the project owner as a mortgagor is obligated to pay under the mortgage and the monthly payment for principal and interest such project owner would be obligated to pay if the mortgage were to bear interest at the rate of 1 per centum per annum.
<br>(d) Mortgage handling expenses
<br>
<br>The Secretary may include in the payment to the mortgagee such amount, in addition to the amount computed under subsection (c), as he deems appropriate to reimburse the mortgagee for its expenses in handling the mortgage.
<br>(e) Operation of project in accordance with requirements respecting tenant eligibility and rents prescribed by Secretary
<br>
<br>(1) As a condition for receiving the benefits of interest reduction payments, the project owner shall operate the project in accordance with such requirements with respect to tenant eligibility and rents as the Secretary may prescribe. Procedures shall be adopted by the Secretary for review of tenant incomes at intervals of one year (or at shorter intervals where the Secretary deems it desirable).
<br>
<br>(2) A project for which interest reduction payments are made under this section and for which the mortgage on the project has been refinanced shall continue to receive the interest reduction payments under this section under the terms of the contract for such payments, but only if the project owner enters into such binding commitments as the Secretary may require (which shall be applicable to any subsequent owner) to ensure that the owner will continue to operate the project in accordance with all low-income affordability restrictions for the project in connection with the Federal assistance for the project for a period having a duration that is not less than the term for which such interest reduction payments are made plus an additional 5 years.
<br>(f) Establishment of basic and fair market rental charges; rental for dwelling units; separate utility metering; additional assistance payments for low-income tenants; limitations; amounts; approval of payments
<br>
<br>(1)(A)(i) For each dwelling unit there shall be established, with the approval of the Secretary, a basic rental charge and fair market rental charge.
<br>
<br>(ii) The basic rental charge shall be—
<br>
<br>(I) the amount needed to operate the project with payments of principal and interest due under a mortgage bearing interest at the rate of 1 percent per annum; or
<br>
<br>(II) an amount greater than that determined under clause (ii)(I), but not greater than the market rent for a comparable unassisted unit, reduced by the value of the interest reduction payments subsidy.
<br>
<br>(iii) The fair market rental charge shall be—
<br>
<br>(I) the amount needed to operate the project with payments of principal, interest, and mortgage insurance premium which the mortgagor is obligated to pay under the mortgage covering the project; or
<br>
<br>(II) an amount greater than that determined under clause (iii)(I), but not greater than the market rent for a comparable unassisted unit.
<br>
<br>(iv) The Secretary may approve a basic rental charge and fair market rental charge for a unit that exceeds the minimum amounts permitted by this subparagraph for such charges only if—
<br>
<br>(I) the approved basic rental charge and fair market rental charges each exceed the applicable minimum charge by the same amount; and
<br>
<br>(II) the project owner agrees to restrictions on project use or mortgage prepayment that are acceptable to the Secretary.
<br>
<br>(v) The Secretary may approve a basic rental charge and fair market rental charge under this paragraph for a unit with assistance under section 1437f of title 42 that differs from the basic rental charge and fair market rental charge for a unit in the same project that is similar in size and amenities but without such assistance, as needed to ensure equitable treatment of tenants in units without such assistance.
<br>
<br>(B)(i) The rental charge for each dwelling unit shall be at the basic rental charge or such greater amount, not exceeding the fair market rental charge determined pursuant to subparagraph (A), as represents 30 percent of the tenant's adjusted income, except as otherwise provided in this subparagraph.
<br>
<br>(ii) In the case of a project which contains more than 5000 units, is subject to an interest reduction payments contract, and is financed under a State or local project, the Secretary may reduce the rental charge ceiling, but in no case shall the rental charge be below the basic rental charge set forth in subparagraph (A)(ii)(I).
<br>
<br>(iii) For plans of action approved for capital grants under the Low-Income Housing Preservation and Resident Homeownership Act of 1990 [12 U.S.C. 4101 et seq.] or the Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987, the rental charge for each dwelling unit shall be at the minimum basic rental charge set forth in subparagraph (A)(ii)(I) or such greater amount, not exceeding the lower of: (I) the fair market rental charge set forth in subparagraph (A)(iii)(I); or (II) the actual rent paid for a comparable unit in comparable unassisted housing in the market area in which the housing assisted under this section is located, as represents 30 percent of the tenant's adjusted income.
<br>
<br>(C) With respect to those projects which the Secretary determines have separate utility metering paid by the tenants for some or all dwelling units, the Secretary may—
<br>
<br>(i) permit the basic rental charge and the fair market rental charge to be determined on the basis of operating the project without the payment of the cost of utility services used by such dwelling units; and
<br>
<br>(ii) permit the charging of a rental for such dwelling units at such an amount less than 30 percent of a tenant's adjusted income as the Secretary determines represents a proportionate decrease for the utility charges to be paid by such tenant, but in no case shall rental be lower than 25 percent of a tenant's adjusted income.
<br>
<br>(2) With respect to 20 per centum of the dwelling units in any project made subject to a contract under this section after August 22, 1974, the Secretary shall make, and contract to make, additional assistance payments to the project owner on behalf of tenants whose incomes are too low for them to afford the basic rentals (including the amount allowed for utilities in the case of a project with separate utility metering) with 30 per centum of their adjusted income. The additional assistance payments authorized by this paragraph with respect to any dwelling unit shall be the amount required to reduce the rental payment (including the amount allowed for utilities in the case of a project with separate utility metering) by the tenant to the highest of the following amounts, rounded to the nearest dollar:
<br>
<br>(A) 30 per centum of the tenant's monthly adjusted income;
<br>
<br>(B) 10 per centum of the tenant's monthly income; or
<br>
<br>(C) if the family is receiving payments for welfare assistance from a public agency and a part of such payments, adjusted in accordance with the family's actual housing costs, is specifically designated by such agency to meet the family's housing costs, the portion of such payments which is so designated.
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, the Secretary may—
<br>
<br>(A) reduce such 20 per centum requirement in the case of any project if he determines that such action is necessary to assure the economic viability of the project; or
<br>
<br>(B) increase such 20 per centum requirement in the case of any project if he determines that such action is necessary and feasible in order to assure, insofar as is practicable, that there is in the project a reasonable range in the income levels of tenants, or that such action is to be taken to meet the housing needs of elderly or handicapped families.
<br>
<br>(3) The Secretary shall utilize amounts credited to the fund described in subsection (g) for the sole purpose of carrying out the purposes of section 201 of the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978. No payments may be made from such fund unless approved in an appropriation Act. No amount may be so approved for any fiscal year beginning after September 30, 1994.
<br>
<br>(4) To ensure that eligible tenants occupying that number of units with respect to which assistance was being provided under this subsection immediately prior to November 30, 1983, receive the benefit of assistance contracted for under paragraph (2), the Secretary shall offer annually to amend contracts entered into under this subsection with owners of projects assisted but not subject to mortgages insured under this section to provide sufficient payments to cover 100 percent of the necessary rent increases and changes in the incomes of eligible tenants, subject to the availability of authority for such purpose under section 1437c(c) of title 42. The Secretary shall take such actions as may be necessary to ensure that payments, including payments that reflect necessary rent increases and changes in the incomes of tenants, are made on a timely basis for all units covered by contracts entered into under paragraph (2).
<br>
<br>(5)(A) In order to induce advances by owners for capital improvements (excluding any owner contributions that may be required by the Secretary as a condition for assistance under section 201 of the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978) to benefit projects assisted under this section, in establishing basic rental charges and fair market rental charges under paragraph (1) the Secretary may include an amount that would permit a return of such advances with interest to the owner out of project income, on such terms and conditions as the Secretary may determine. Any resulting increase in rent contributions shall be—
<br>
<br>(i) to a level not exceeding the lower of 30 percent of the adjusted income of the tenant or the published existing fair market rent for comparable housing established under section 1437f(c) of title 42;
<br>
<br>(ii) phased in equally over a period of not less than 3 years, if such increase is 30 percent or more; and
<br>
<br>(iii) limited to not more than 10 percent per year if such increase is more than 10 percent but less than 30 percent.
<br>
<br>(B) Assistance under section 1437f of title 42 shall be provided, to the extent available under appropriations Acts, if necessary to mitigate any adverse effects on income-eligible tenants.
<br>
<br>(6) Repealed. Pub. L. 104–99, title IV, §405(d)(2), Jan. 26, 1996, 110 Stat. 45.
<br>
<br>(7) The Secretary shall determine whether and under what conditions the provisions of this subsection shall apply to mortgages sold by the Secretary on a negotiated basis.
<br>(g) Collection of excess rental charges; credit to reserve for additional assistance payments; retention by project owner
<br>
<br>(1) The project owner shall, as required by the Secretary, accumulate, safeguard, and periodically pay the Secretary or such other entity as determined by the Secretary and upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary deems appropriate, all rental charges collected on a unit-by-unit basis in excess of the basic rental charges. Unless otherwise directed by the Secretary, such excess charges shall be credited to a reserve used by the Secretary to make additional assistance payments as provided in paragraph (3) of subsection (f).
<br>
<br>(2) Notwithstanding any other requirements of this subsection, a project owner may retain some or all of such excess charges for project use if authorized by the Secretary. Such excess charges shall be used for the project and upon terms and conditions established by the Secretary, unless the Secretary permits the owner to retain funds for non-project use after a determination that the project is well-maintained housing in good condition and that the owner has not engaged in material adverse financial or managerial actions or omissions as described in section 516 of the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997. In connection with the retention of funds for non-project use, the Secretary may require the project owner to enter into a binding commitment (which shall be applicable to any subsequent owner) to ensure that the owner will continue to operate the project in accordance with all low-income affordability restrictions for the project in connection with the Federal assistance for the project for a period having a duration of not less than the term of the existing affordability restrictions plus an additional 5 years.
<br>
<br>(3) The Secretary shall not withhold approval of the retention by the owner of such excess charges because of the existence of unpaid excess charges if such unpaid amount is being remitted to the Secretary over a period of time in accordance with a workout agreement with the Secretary, unless the Secretary determines that the owner is in violation of the workout agreement.
<br>(h) Rules and regulations
<br>
<br>In addition to establishing the requirements specified in subsection (e), the Secretary is authorized to make such rules and regulations, to enter into such agreements, and to adopt such procedures as he may deem necessary or desirable to carry out the provisions of this section.
<br>(i) Authorization of appropriations; aggregate amount of contracts; contracts for assistance payments; income limitations; availability of amounts for projects approved prior to rehabilitation and projects for occupancy by elderly or handicapped families; definitions
<br>
<br>(1) There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section, including such sums as may be necessary to make interest reduction payments under contracts entered into by the Secretary under this section. The aggregate amount of outstanding contracts to make such payments shall not exceed amounts approved in appropriation Acts, and payments pursuant to such contracts shall not exceed $75,000,000 per annum prior to July 1, 1969, which maximum dollar amount shall be increased by $125,000,000 on July 1, 1969, by $150,000,000 on July 1, 1970, by $200,000,000 on July 1, 1971 and by $75,000,000 on July 1, 1974. The Secretary shall utilize, to the extent necessary after September 30, 1984, any authority under this section that is recaptured either as the result of the conversion of housing projects covered by assistance under subsection (f)(2) to contracts for assistance under section 1437f of title 42 or otherwise for the purpose of making assistance payments, including amendments as provided in subsection (f)(4), with respect to housing projects assisted, but not subject to mortgages insured, under this section that remain covered by assistance under subsection (f)(2).
<br>
<br>(2) Contracts for assistance payments under this section may be entered into only with respect to tenants whose incomes do not exceed 80 per centum of the median family income for the area, as determined by the Secretary with adjustments for smaller and larger families, except that the Secretary may establish income ceilings higher or lower than 80 per centum of the median for the area on the basis of his findings that such variations are necessary because of prevailing levels of construction costs, unusually high or low family incomes, or other factors.
<br>
<br>(3) Not less than 10 per centum of the total amount of contracts for assistance payments authorized by appropriation Acts to be made after June 30, 1974, shall be available for use only with respect to dwellings, or dwelling units in projects, which are approved by the Secretary prior to rehabilitation.
<br>
<br>(4) At least 20 per centum of the total amount of contracts for assistance payments authorized in appropriation Acts to be made after June 30, 1974, shall be available for use only with respect to projects which are planned in whole or in part for occupancy by elderly or handicapped families. As used in this paragraph, the term "elderly families" means families which consist of two or more persons the head of which (or his spouse) is sixty-two years of age or over or is handicapped. Such term also means a single person who is sixty-two years of age or over or is handicapped. A person shall be considered handicapped if such person is determined, pursuant to regulations issued by the Secretary, to have an impairment which (A) is expected to be of long-continued and indefinite duration, (B) substantially impedes his ability to live independently, and (C) is of such a nature that such ability could be improved by more suitable housing conditions.

<br>
<br>(3) To be eligible for insurance under this subsection, a mortgage shall meet the requirements specified in subsections (d)(1) and (d)(3) of section 1715l of this title, except as such requirements are modified by this subsection. In the case of a project financed with a mortgage insured under this subsection which involves a mortgagor other than a cooperative or a private nonprofit corporation or association and which is sold to a cooperative or a nonprofit corporation or association, the Secretary is further authorized to insure under this subsection a mortgage given by such purchaser in an amount not exceeding the appraised value of the property at the time of purchase, which value shall be based upon a mortgage amount on which the debt service can be met from the income of the property when operated on a nonprofit basis, after payment of all operating expenses, taxes, and required reserves.
<br>
<br>(4) A mortgage to be insured under this subsection shall—
<br>
<br>(A) be executed by a mortgagor eligible under subsection (d)(3) or (e) of section 1715l of this title;
<br>
<br>(B) bear interest at a rate not to exceed such percent per annum on the amount of the principal obligation outstanding at any time as the Secretary determines is necessary to meet the mortgage market, taking into consideration the yields on mortgages in the primary and secondary markets; and
<br>
<br>(C) provide for complete amortization by periodic payments within such term as the Secretary may prescribe.
<br>
<br>(5) The property or project shall—
<br>
<br>(A) comply with such standards and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe to establish the acceptability of the property for mortgage insurance and may include such nondwelling facilities as the Secretary deems adequate and appropriate to serve the occupants and the surrounding neighborhood: Provided, That the project shall be predominantly residential and any nondwelling facility included in the mortgage shall be found by the Secretary to contribute to the economic feasibility of the project, and the Secretary shall give due consideration to the possible effect of the project on other business enterprises in the community: Provided further, That, in the case of a project designed primarily for occupancy by elderly or handicapped families, the project may include related facilities for use by elderly or handicapped families, including cafeterias or dining halls, community rooms, workshops, infirmaries, or other inpatient or outpatient health facilities, and other essential service facilities;
<br>
<br>(B) include five or more dwelling units, but such units, in the case of a project designed primarily for occupancy by displaced, elderly, or handicapped families, need not, with the approval of the Secretary, contain kitchen facilities; and
<br>
<br>(C) be designed primarily for use as a rental project to be occupied by lower income families or by elderly or handicapped families: Provided, That lower income persons who are less than sixty-two years of age shall be eligible for occupancy in such a project.
<br>
<br>In any case in which it is determined in accordance with regulations of the Secretary that facilities in existence or under construction on December 31, 1970, which could appropriately be used for classroom purposes are available in any such property or project and that public schools in the community are overcrowded due in part to the attendance at such schools of residents of the property or project, such facilities may be used for such purposes to the extent permitted in such regulations (without being subject to any of the requirements of the first proviso in subparagraph (A) except the requirement that the project be predominantly residential).
<br>
<br>(6) With the approval of the Secretary, the mortgagor may sell the individual dwelling units to lower income or elderly or handicapped purchasers. The Secretary may consent to the release of the mortgagor from his liability under the mortgage and the credit instrument secured thereby, or consent to the release of parts of the mortgaged property from the lien of the mortgage, upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe, and the mortgage may provide for such release.
