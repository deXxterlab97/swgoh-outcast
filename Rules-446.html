<br>(B) the product obtained by multiplying—
<br>
<br>(i) the sum of—
<br>
<br>(I) the average principal outstanding for the calendar year on loans made by the bank that are in nonaccrual status; and
<br>
<br>(II) the average amount outstanding for the calendar year of other-than-temporarily impaired investments made by the bank; by
<br>
<br>(ii) 0.0010.
<br>(2) Deductions from average outstanding insured obligations
<br>
<br>The average outstanding insured obligations issued by the bank for the calendar year referred to in paragraph (1)(A) shall be reduced by deducting from the obligations the sum of (as determined by the Corporation)—
<br>
<br>(A) 90 percent of each of—
<br>
<br>(i) the average principal outstanding for the calendar year on the guaranteed portions of Federal government-guaranteed loans made by the bank that are in accrual status; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the average amount outstanding for the calendar year of the guaranteed portions of Federal government-guaranteed investments made by the bank that are not permanently impaired; and
<br>
<br>(B) 80 percent of each of—
<br>
<br>(i) the average principal outstanding for the calendar year on the guaranteed portions of State government-guaranteed loans made by the bank that are in accrual status; and

<br>(4) Definition of government-guaranteed loans or investments
<br>
<br>In this section, the term "government-guaranteed", when applied to a loan or an investment, means a loan, credit, or investment, or portion of a loan, credit, or investment, that is guaranteed—
<br>
<br>(A) by the full faith and credit of the United States Government or any State government;
<br>
<br>(B) by an agency or other entity of the United States Government whose obligations are explicitly guaranteed by the United States Government; or
<br>
<br>(C) by an agency or other entity of a State government whose obligations are explicitly guaranteed by such State government.
<br>(b) Amount in Fund exceeding secure base amount
<br>
<br>At any time the aggregate of amounts in the Farm Credit Insurance Fund exceeds the secure base amount, the Corporation shall reduce the premium due from each insured System bank, as determined under subsection (a)(1), by a percentage determined by the Corporation so that the aggregate of the premiums payable by all System banks is sufficient to ensure that the aggregate of amounts in the Farm Credit Insurance Fund after such premiums are paid is not less than the secure base amount at such time.
<br>(c) Secure base amount
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>For purposes of this part, the term "secure base amount" means, with respect to any point in time, 2 percent of the aggregate outstanding insured obligations of all insured System banks at such time (as adjusted under paragraph (2)), or such other percentage of the aggregate amount as the Corporation in its sole discretion determines is actuarially sound to maintain in the Insurance Fund taking into account the risk of insuring outstanding insured obligations.
<br>(2) Adjustment
<br>
<br>The aggregate outstanding insured obligations of all insured System banks under paragraph (1) shall be adjusted downward to exclude an amount equal to the sum of (as determined by the corporation)—

<br>
<br>(ii) the guaranteed portions of the amount of State government-guaranteed investments made by the banks that are not permanently impaired.
<br>(d) Determination of loan and investment amounts
<br>
<br>For the purpose of subsections (a) and (c), the principal outstanding on all loans made by an insured System bank, and the amount outstanding on all investments made by an insured System bank, shall be determined based on—
<br>
<br>(1) all loans or investments made by any production credit association, or any other association making direct loans under authority provided under section 2279b of this title, that is able to make such loans or investments because such association is receiving, or has received, funds provided through the insured System bank;
<br>
<br>(2) all loans or investments made by any bank, company, institution, corporation, union, or association described in section 2015(b)(1)(B) of this title, that is able to make such loans or investments because such entity is receiving, or has received, funds provided through the insured System bank; and
<br>
<br>(3) all loans or investments made by such insured System bank (other than loans made to any party described in paragraph (1) or (2)).
<br>(e) Allocation to System institutions of excess reserves
<br>(1) Establishment of Allocated Insurance Reserves Accounts
<br>
<br>There is hereby established in the Farm Credit Insurance Fund an Allocated Insurance Reserves Account—
<br>
<br>(A) for each insured System bank; and
<br>
<br>(B) subject to paragraph (6)(C), for all holders, in the aggregate, of Financial Assistance Corporation stock.
<br>(2) Treatment
<br>
<br>Amounts in any Allocated Insurance Reserves Account shall be considered to be part of the Farm Credit Insurance Fund.
<br>(3) Annual allocations
<br>
<br>If, at the end of any calendar year, the aggregate of the amounts in the Farm Credit Insurance Fund exceeds the secure base amount, the Corporation shall allocate to the Allocated Insurance Reserves Accounts the excess amount less the amount that the Corporation, in its sole discretion, determines to be the sum of the estimated operating expenses and estimated insurance obligations of the Corporation for the immediately succeeding calendar year.
<br>(4) Allocation formula
<br>
<br>From the total amount required to be allocated at the end of a calendar year under paragraph (3)—
<br>
<br>(A) 10 percent of the total amount shall be credited to the Allocated Insurance Reserves Account established under paragraph (1)(B), subject to paragraph (6)(C); and
<br>
<br>(B) there shall be credited to the allocated insurance reserves account 1 of each insured system 2 bank an amount that bears the same ratio to the total amount (less any amount credited under subparagraph (A)) as—
<br>
<br>(i) the average principal outstanding for the calendar year on insured obligations issued by the bank (after deducting from the principal the percentages of the guaranteed portions of loans and investments described in subsection (a)(2)); bears to
<br>
<br>(ii) the average principal outstanding for the calendar year on insured obligations issued by all insured System banks (after deducting from the principal the percentages of the guaranteed portions of loans and investments described in subsection (a)(2)).
<br>(5) Use of funds in Allocated Insurance Reserves Accounts
<br>
<br>To the extent that the sum of the operating expenses of the Corporation and the insurance obligations of the Corporation for a calendar year exceeds the sum of operating expenses and insurance obligations determined under paragraph (3) for the calendar year, the Corporation shall cover the expenses and obligations by—
<br>
<br>(A) reducing each Allocated Insurance Reserves Account by the same proportion; and
<br>
<br>(B) expending the amounts obtained under subparagraph (A) before expending other amounts in the Fund.
<br>(6) Other disposition of Account funds
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>As soon as practicable during each calendar year, the Corporation may—
<br>
<br>(i) subject to subparagraph (D), pay to each insured System bank, in a manner determined by the Corporation, an amount equal to the balance in the Allocated Insurance Reserves Account of the System bank; and
<br>
<br>(ii) subject to subparagraphs (C) and (E), pay to each System bank and association holding Financial Assistance Corporation stock a proportionate share, determined by dividing the number of shares of Financial Assistance Corporation stock held by the institution by the total number of shares of Financial Assistance Corporation stock outstanding at the time of the termination of the Financial Assistance Corporation, of the balance in the Allocated Insurance Reserves Account established under paragraph (1)(B).
<br>(B) Authority to eliminate or reduce payments
<br>
<br>The Corporation may eliminate or reduce payments during a calendar year under subparagraph (A) if the Corporation determines, in its sole discretion, that the payments, or other circumstances that might require use of the Farm Credit Insurance Fund, could cause the amount in the Farm Credit Insurance Fund during the calendar year to be less than the secure base amount.
<br>(C) Reimbursement for Financial Assistance Corporation stock
<br>(i) Sufficient funding
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding paragraph (4)(A), on provision by the Corporation for the accumulation in the Account established under paragraph (1)(B) of funds in an amount equal to $56,000,000, the Corporation shall not allocate any further funds to the Account except to replenish the Account if funds are diminished below $56,000,000 by the Corporation under paragraph (5).
<br>(ii) Termination of account
<br>
<br>On disbursement of an amount equal to $56,000,000, the Corporation shall—
<br>
<br>(I) close the account established under paragraph (1)(B); and
<br>
<br>(II) transfer any remaining funds in the Account to the remaining Allocated Insurance Reserves Accounts in accordance with paragraph (4)(B) for the calendar year in which the transfer occurs.
<br>(D) Distribution of payments received
<br>
<br>Not later than 60 days after receipt of a payment made under subparagraph (A)(i), each insured System bank, in consultation with affiliated associations of the insured System bank, and taking into account the direct or indirect payment of insurance premiums by the associations, shall develop and implement an equitable plan to distribute payments received under subparagraph (A)(i) among the bank and associations of the bank.
<br>(E) Exception for previously reimbursed associations
<br>
<br>For purposes of subparagraph (A)(ii), in any Farm Credit district in which the funding bank has reimbursed 1 or more affiliated associations of the bank for the previously unreimbursed portion of the Financial Assistance Corporation stock held by the associations, the funding bank shall be deemed to be the holder of the shares of Financial Assistance Corporation stock for which the funding bank has provided the reimbursement.

<br>(3) Limitation
<br>(A) Least-cost resolution
<br>
<br>Assistance may not be provided to an insured System bank under this subsection unless the means of providing the assistance is the least costly means of providing the assistance by the Farm Credit Insurance Fund of all possible alternatives available to the Corporation, including liquidation of the bank (including paying the insured obligations issued on behalf of the bank). Before making a least-cost determination under this subparagraph, the Corporation shall accord such other insured System banks as the Corporation determines to be appropriate the opportunity to submit information relating to the determination.

<br>(D) Rule for stand-alone assistance
<br>

<br>On the payment to an owner of an insured obligation issued on behalf of an insured System bank in receivership, the Corporation shall be subrogated to all rights of the owner against the bank to the extent of the payment.
<br>(2) Receipt of dividends
<br>
<br>Subrogation under paragraph (1) shall include the right on the part of the Corporation to receive the same dividends from the proceeds of the assets of the bank as would have been payable to the owner on a claim for the insured obligation.
<br>(d) Right to assets
<br>
<br>Any agreement that shall diminish or defeat the right, title, or interest of the Corporation in any asset acquired by such Corporation under this section, either as security for a loan or by purchase, shall not be valid against the Corporation unless the agreement—
