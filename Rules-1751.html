<br>
<br>(3) who is transferred to another department or agency of the United States under circumstances in which, by any other law, his leave may be transferred.
<br>

<br>Amendment by Pub. L. 105–85 effective Jan. 1, 1998, see section 603(e) of Pub. L. 105–85, set out as a note under section 5561 of Title 5, Government Organization and Employees.
<br>§552. Pay and allowances; continuance while in a missing status; limitations
<br>
<br>(a) A member of a uniformed service who is on active duty or performing inactive-duty training, and who is in a missing status, is—
<br>
<br>(1) for the period he is in that status, entitled to receive or have credited to his account the same pay and allowances, as defined in this chapter, to which he was entitled at the beginning of that period or may thereafter become entitled; and
<br>
<br>(2) for the period, not to exceed one year, required for his hospitalization and rehabilitation after termination of that status, under regulations prescribed by the Secretaries concerned, with respect to incentive pay, considered to have satisfied the requirements of section 301 or section 351(a)(2) of this title so as to entitle him to a continuance of that pay.
<br>
<br>However, a member who is performing full-time training duty or other full-time duty without pay, or inactive-duty training with or without pay, is entitled to the pay and allowances to which he would have been entitled if he had been on active duty with pay. Notwithstanding section 1523 of title 10 or any other provision of law, the promotion of a member while he is in a missing status is fully effective for all purposes.
<br>
<br>(b) The expiration of a member's term of service while he is in a missing status does not end his entitlement to pay and allowances under subsection (a). Notwithstanding the death of a member while in a missing status, entitlement to pay and allowances under subsection (a) ends on the date—
<br>
<br>(1) the Secretary concerned receives evidence that the member is dead; or
<br>
<br>(2) that his death is prescribed or determined under section 555 of this title or under chapter 76 of title 10.
<br>
<br>(c) A member is not entitled to pay and allowances under subsection (a) for a period during which he is officially determined to be absent from his post of duty without authority, and he is indebted to the United States for payments from amounts credited to his account for that period.
<br>
<br>(d) A member who is performing full-time training duty or inactive-duty training is entitled to the benefits of this section only when he is officially determined to be in a missing status that results from the performance of duties prescribed by competent authority.
<br>
<br>(e) A member in a missing status who is continued in that status under section 555 of this title or under chapter 76 of title 10 is entitled to be credited with pay and allowances under subsection (a).

<br>§555. Secretarial review
<br>
<br>(a) Except as provided in subsection (d), when a member of a uniformed service entitled to pay and allowances under section 552 of this title has been in a missing status, and the official report of his death or of the circumstances of his absence has not been received by the Secretary concerned, he shall, before the end of a 12-month period in that status, have the case fully reviewed. After that review and the end of the 12-month period in a missing status, or after a later review which shall be made when warranted by information received or other circumstances, the Secretary concerned, or his designee, may—
<br>
<br>(1) if the member can reasonably be presumed to be living, direct a continuance of his missing status; or
<br>
<br>(2) make a finding of death.
<br>
<br>(b) When a finding of death is made under subsection (a), it shall include the date death is presumed to have occurred for the purpose of—
<br>
<br>(1) ending the crediting of pay and allowances;
<br>
<br>(2) settlement of accounts; and
<br>

This subsection does not entitle a dependent to pay, allowances, or other compensation to which he is not otherwise entitled.

<br>§556. Secretarial determinations
<br>
<br>(a) The Secretary concerned, or his designee, may make any determination necessary to administer this chapter and, when so made, it is conclusive as to—
<br>
<br>(1) death or finding of death;
<br>
<br>(2) the fact of dependency under this chapter;
<br>
<br>(3) the fact of dependency for the purpose of paying six months' death gratuities authorized by law;
<br>
<br>(4) the fact of dependency under any other law authorizing the payment of pay, allowances, or other emoluments to enlisted members of the armed forces, when the payments are contingent on dependency;
<br>
<br>(5) any other status covered by this chapter;
<br>
<br>(6) an essential date, including one on which evidence or information is received by the Secretary concerned; and
<br>
<br>(7) whether information received concerning a member of a uniformed service is to be construed and acted on as an official report of death.
<br>
<br>Paragraphs (1), (5), (6), and (7) only apply with respect to a case to which section 555 of this title applies.
<br>
<br>(b) When the Secretary concerned, in a case to which section 555 of this title applies, receives information that he considers establishes conclusively the death of a member of a uniformed service, he shall, notwithstanding any earlier action relating to death or other status of the member, act on it as an official report of death. After the end of the 12-month period in a missing status prescribed by section 555 of this title, the Secretary concerned, or his designee, shall, when he considers that the information received, or a lapse of time without information, establishes a reasonable presumption that a member in a missing status is dead, make a finding of death.
<br>
<br>(c) The Secretary concerned, or his designee, may determine the entitlement of a member to pay and allowances under this chapter, including credits and charges in his account, and that determination is conclusive. An account may not be charged or debited with an amount that a member captured, beleaguered, or besieged by a hostile force may receive or be entitled to receive from, or have placed to his credit by, the hostile force as pay, allowances, or other compensation.
<br>
<br>(d) The Secretary concerned, or his designee, may, when warranted by the circumstances, reconsider a determination made under this chapter, and change or modify it.
<br>
<br>(e) When the account of a member has been charged or debited with an allotment paid under this chapter, the amount so charged or debited shall be recredited to the account of the member if the Secretary concerned, or his designee, determines that the payment was induced by fraud or misrepresentation to which the member was not a party.
<br>
<br>(f) Except an allotment for an unearned insurance premium, an allotment paid from pay and allowances of a member for the period he is entitled to pay and allowances under section 552 of this title may not be collected from the allottee as an overpayment when it was caused by delay in receiving evidence of death. An allotment payment for a period after the end of entitlement to pay and allowances under this chapter, or otherwise, which was caused by delay in receiving evidence of death, may not be collected from the allottee or charged against the pay of the deceased member.
<br>
<br>(g) The Secretary concerned, or his designee, may waive the recovery of an erroneous payment or overpayment of an allotment to a dependent if he considers recovery is against equity and good conscience.
<br>
<br>(h) For the sole purpose of determining pay under this section, a dependent of a member of a uniformed service on active duty is treated as if he were a member. Any determination made by the Secretary concerned, or his designee, under this section in a case to which section 555 of this title applies is conclusive on all other departments and agencies of the United States. This subsection does not entitle a dependent to pay, allowances, or other compensation to which he is not otherwise entitled.

<br>§557. Settlement of accounts
<br>
<br>(a) The Secretary concerned, or his designee, may settle the account of—
<br>
<br>(1) a member of a uniformed service for whose account payments have been made under sections 552, 553, and 555 of this title; and
<br>
<br>(2) a survivor of a casualty to a ship, station, or military installation which results in the loss or destruction of disbursing records.

<br>That settlement is conclusive on the accounting officers of the United States in settling the accounts of disbursing officers.
<br>
<br>(b) Payment or settlement of an account made pursuant to a report, determination, or finding of death may not be recovered or reopened because of a later report or determination which fixes a date of death. However, an account shall be reopened and settled on the basis of a date of death so fixed which is later than that used as a basis for earlier settlements.
<br>
<br>(c) In the settlement of his accounts, a disbursing officer is entitled, if there is no fraud or criminality by him, to credit for an erroneous payment or overpayment he made in carrying out this chapter, except section 558 of this title. Unless there is fraud or criminality by him, recovery may not be made from a civilian officer or employee or a member of a uniformed service who authorizes a payment under this chapter, except section 558 of this title.
