<br>"(5) the First Annual Report to Congress of the Urban Initiatives Anti-Crime Program and the two General Accounting Office [now Government Accountability Office] reports to Congress on such Program have provided useful suggestions which can now be implemented.
<br>
<br>"(c) It is, therefore, the purpose of this section to continue the efforts of the Urban Initiatives Anti-Crime Program so that more progress can be made in providing secure, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling units for low-income and elderly tenants in public housing projects.
<br>
<br>"(d) [This subsection amended section 207 of Pub. L. 95–557, set out below.]."
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 95–557, title II, §207, Oct. 31, 1978, 92 Stat. 2093, as amended by Pub. L. 96–399, title II, §209(d), Oct. 8, 1980, 94 Stat. 1635; Pub. L. 98–479, title II, §201(i), Oct. 17, 1984, 98 Stat. 2228; Pub. L. 103–82, title IV, §405(c), Sept. 21, 1993, 107 Stat. 921, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(a) This section may be cited as the 'Public Housing Security Demonstration Act of 1978'.
<br>
<br>"(b)(1) The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>"(A) low-income and elderly public housing residents of the Nation have suffered substantially from rising crime and violence, and are being threatened as a result of inadequate security arrangements for the prevention of physical violence, theft, burglary, and other crimes;
<br>
<br>"(B) older persons generally regard the fear of crime as the most serious problem in their lives, to the extent that one-fourth of all Americans over 65 voluntarily restrict their mobility because of it;
<br>
<br>"(C) crime and the fear of crime have led some residents to move from public housing projects;
<br>
<br>"(D) an integral part of successfully providing decent, safe, and sanitary dwellings for low-income persons is to insure that the housing is secure;
<br>
<br>"(E) local public housing authorities may have inadequate security arrangements for the prevention of crime and vandalism; and
<br>
<br>"(F) action is needed to provide for the security of public housing residents and to preserve the Nation's investment in its public housing stock.
<br>
<br>"(2) It is, therefore, declared to be the policy of the United States to provide for a demonstration and evaluation of effective means of mitigating crime and vandalism in public housing projects, in order to provide a safe living environment for the residents, particularly the elderly residents, of such projects.
<br>
<br>"(c)(1) The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall promptly initiate and carry out during the fiscal year beginning on October 1, 1978, to the extent approved in appropriation Acts, a program for the development, demonstration, and evaluation of improved, innovative community anticrime and security methods, concepts and techniques which will mitigate the level of crime in public housing projects and their surrounding neighborhoods.
<br>
<br>"(2) In selecting public housing projects to receive assistance under this section, the Secretary shall assure that a broad spectrum of project types, locations and tenant populations are represented and shall consider at least the following: the extent of crime and vandalism currently existing in the projects; the extent, nature and quality of community anticrime efforts in the projects and surrounding areas; the extent, nature and quality of police and other protective services available to the projects and their tenants; the demand for public housing units in the locality, the vacancy rate, and extent of abandonment of such units; and the characteristics and needs of the public housing tenants.
<br>
<br>"(3) In selecting the anticrime and security methods, concepts and techniques to be demonstrated under this section, the Secretary shall consider the improvement of physical security equipment or dwelling units in those projects, social and environmental design improvements, tenant awareness and volunteer programs, tenant participation and employment in providing security services, and such other measures as deemed necessary or appropriate by the Secretary. Particular attention shall be given to comprehensive community anticrime and security plans submitted by public housing authorities which (i) provide for coordination between public housing management and local law enforcement officials, or (ii) coordinate resources available to the community through programs funded by the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Labor, the Community Services Administration, and the Corporation for National and Community Service, or other Federal or State agencies.
<br>
<br>"(4) In carrying out the provisions of this section, the Secretary shall coordinate and jointly target resources with other agencies, particularly the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Labor, the Department of Justice, the Department of the Interior, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Education, the Corporation for National and Community Service, the Community Services Administration, and State and local agencies.
<br>
<br>"(5) In order to assess the impact of crime and vandalism in public housing projects, the Secretary may, as part of the Annual Housing Survey conducted by the Department of Housing and Urban Development or by other means, collect data on crime and vandalism and integrate the data collection with the victimization surveys undertaken by the Department of Justice and the Department of Commerce.
<br>
<br>"(6) The Secretary shall, to the maximum extent practicable, utilize information derived from the program authorized by this section for assisting in establishing (A) guidelines to be used by public housing authorities in determining strategies to meet the security needs of tenants of public housing projects assisted under the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.] other than under section 8 of such Act [42 U.S.C. 1437f], and (B) guidelines for improvements relating to the security of projects (and the tenants living in such projects) assisted under section 14 of such Act [42 U.S.C. 1437l].
<br>
<br>"(d) The Secretary shall initiate and carry out a survey of crime and vandalism existing in the Nation's public housing projects. The survey shall include the nature, extent and impact of crime and vandalism and the nature and extent of resources currently available and employed to alleviate crime and vandalism in public housing.
<br>
<br>"(e) The Secretary shall report to the Congress not later than eighteen months after the date of enactment of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1980 [Oct. 8, 1980]. Such report shall include the results of the survey on crime and vandalism in public housing; findings from the demonstration and evaluation of various methods of reducing the level of crime; and legislative recommendations, if appropriate for (A) a comprehensive program to increase security in public housing projects and (B) increasing the coordination between anticrime programs of other State and Federal agencies that may be used by public housing authorities. Any recommendations shall include estimated costs of such programs.
<br>
<br>"(f) Of the additional authority approved in appropriation Acts with respect to entering into annual contributions contracts under section 5(c) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437c(c)] for the fiscal year beginning on October 1, 1978, the Secretary may utilize up to $12,000,000 of such authority in the fiscal year beginning on October 1, 1978, for the establishment of the public housing security demonstration program authorized by this section. Of the authority approved in appropriation Acts for the purpose of entering into annual contributions contracts under section 5(c) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 with respect to the fiscal year beginning on October 1, 1980, the Secretary may enter into contracts to carry out this section, except that the aggregate amount obligated over the duration of such contracts may not exceed $10,000,000."
<br>§1701z–7. Studies to determine extent of need for counseling to mortgagors; report to Congress
<br>
<br>(a) In carrying out activities under section 1701z–1 of this title, the Secretary is directed to undertake programs of studies and demonstrations within at least three standard metropolitan statistical areas to determine the extent of need for and cost effectiveness of providing pre-purchase, default and delinquency counseling and related services to owners and purchasers of single-family dwellings insured or to be insured under the unsubsidized mortgage insurance programs of the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.].
<br>
<br>(b) Within one year from August 3, 1976, the Secretary shall submit an interim report to the Congress with respect to the progress made under such studies and demonstrations, including an estimate as to the date when a final report on the results of such demonstrations will be made available to the Congress.

<br>(f) Discretionary assistance
<br>
<br>In addition to the actions required under subsection (e) for a subsidized, formerly subsidized, or unsubsidized multifamily housing project, the Secretary may, pursuant to the disposition plan and the goals in subsection (a), take one or more of the following actions:
<br>(1) Discounted sales price
<br>
<br>In accordance with the authority provided under the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.], the Secretary may reduce the selling price of the project. Such reduced sales price shall be reasonably related to the intended use of the property after sale, any rehabilitation requirements for the project, the rents for units in the project that can be supported by the market, the amount of rental assistance available for the project under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437f], the occupancy profile of the project (including family size and income levels for tenant families), and any other factors that the Secretary considers appropriate.
<br>(2) Use and rent restrictions

<br>(B) such loan has a term of not more than 5 years;
<br>
<br>(C) the Secretary determines, based upon documentation provided to the Secretary, that the borrower has obtained a commitment of permanent financing to replace the short-term loan from a lender who meets standards established by the Secretary; and

<br>(4) Up-front grants
<br>
<br>If the Secretary determines that action under this paragraph is more cost-effective than establishing rents pursuant to subsection (h)(2), the Secretary may utilize the budget authority provided for contracts issued under this section for project-based assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437f] to (in addition to providing project-based section 8 rental assistance) provide up-front grants for the necessary cost of rehabilitation and other related development costs. This paragraph shall be effective during fiscal years 2006 through 2010 only to the extent that such budget authority is made available for use under this paragraph in advance in appropriation Acts.
<br>(5) Tenant-based assistance

<br>
<br>(ii) 5 percent of the total number of units in multifamily housing projects that are disposed of by the Secretary during any fiscal year to be used in any manner, if the Secretary and the unit of general local government or area-wide governing body determine that such use will further fair housing, community development, or neighborhood revitalization goals.
<br>(B) Displacement protection
<br>
<br>The Secretary may take actions under subparagraph (A) only if—
<br>
<br>(i) tenant-based rental assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437f] is made available to each eligible family residing in the project that is displaced as a result of such actions; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the Secretary determines that sufficient habitable, affordable rental housing is available in the market area in which the project is located to ensure use of such assistance.
<br>(7) Transfer for use under other programs of Secretary

<br>
<br>(ii) ensure that no tenant of the project will be displaced as a result of actions taken under this paragraph.

<br>
<br>(A) the project is not being maintained in a decent, safe, and sanitary condition;

<br>
<br>The Secretary shall establish any procedures necessary to carry out this subsection.
<br>(j) Displacement of tenants and relocation assistance

<br>(4) Sale of mortgages covering unsubsidized projects

<br>(c) Definitions
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section:
<br>
<br>(1) The term "base loan" means any mortgage loan for a residential building eligible for insurance under title II of the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1707 et seq.] or title 38 that does not include the cost of cost-effective energy improvements.
<br>
<br>(2) The term "cost-effective" means, with respect to energy efficiency improvements to a residential building, improvements that result in the total present value cost of the improvements (including any maintenance and repair expenses) being less than the total present value of the energy saved over the useful life of the improvement, when 100 percent of the cost of improvements is added to the base loan. For purposes of this paragraph, savings and cost-effectiveness shall be determined pursuant to a home energy rating report sufficient for purposes of the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or by other technically accurate methods.
<br>
<br>(3) The term "energy efficient mortgage" means a mortgage on a residential building that recognizes the energy savings of a home that has cost-effective energy saving construction or improvements (including solar water heaters, solar-assisted air conditioners and ventilators, super-insulation, and insulating glass and film) and that has the effect of not disqualifying a borrower who, but for the expenditures on energy saving construction or improvements, would otherwise have qualified for a base loan.
<br>
<br>(4) The term "residential building" means any attached or unattached single family residence.
<br>(d) Rule of construction
<br>
<br>This section may not be construed to affect any other programs of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development for energy-efficient mortgages. The pilot program carried out under this section shall not replace or result in the termination of such other programs.
<br>(e) Regulations
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall issue any regulations necessary to carry out this section not later than the expiration of the 180-day period beginning on October 24, 1992. The regulations shall be issued after notice and opportunity for public comment pursuant to the provisions of section 553 of title 5 (notwithstanding subsections (a)(2), (b)(B), and (d)(3) of such section).
<br>(f) Authorization of appropriations
<br>
<br>There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out this section.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 102–486, title I, §106, Oct. 24, 1992, 106 Stat. 2792; Pub. L. 110–289, div. B, title I, §2123, July 30, 2008, 122 Stat. 2839.)
