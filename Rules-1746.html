<br>
<br>(1) A member assigned to a high cost area in the continental United States.
<br>
<br>(2) A member assigned to an unaccompanied tour of duty outside the continental United States if the primary dependent of the member resides in a high cost area in the continental United States.
<br>
<br>(3) A member assigned to duty in the continental United States if the Secretary of the uniformed service concerned determines that—
<br>
<br>(A) the primary dependent of the member must reside in a high cost area in the continental United States by reason of the member's duty location or other circumstances; and
<br>
<br>(B) it would be inequitable for the member's eligibility for the allowance to be determined on the basis of the duty location of the member.
<br>
<br>(c) High Cost Area Defined.—An area is a high cost area for a fiscal year for purposes of this section if the uniformed services cost of living for that area for the base period exceeds the average cost of living in the continental United States for such base period by at least the threshold percentage. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the other administering Secretaries, shall establish the threshold percentage, except that the threshold percentage may not be less than 8 percent. The administering Secretaries shall prescribe a higher threshold percentage to be applied for a fiscal year when it is necessary to do so in order to ensure that the total amount of the payments of the cost-of-living allowance made to members of the uniformed services under this section for such fiscal year does not exceed the total amount available to all uniformed services for that fiscal year for paying such allowance.
<br>
<br>(d) Amount of Allowance.—The cost-of-living allowance that may be paid to a member for a high cost area for a fiscal year shall be the amount that is equal to the product of—
<br>
<br>(1) the amount of the average spendable income determined applicable for the regular military compensation level of such member under subsection (g); and
<br>
<br>(2) the percentage equal to the excess of—
<br>
<br>(A) the percentage by which the uniformed services cost of living for the member's high cost area for the base period exceeds the average cost of living in the continental United States for such base period, over
<br>
<br>(B) the threshold percentage applicable to such fiscal year under subsection (c).
<br>
<br>(e) Limitation to One Allowance.—If primary dependents of a member reside separately in different high cost areas—
<br>
<br>(1) the member may be paid only one cost-of-living allowance under this section; and
<br>
<br>(2) the cost-of-living allowance payable to the member shall be the highest of the amounts computed under this section for such high cost areas.
<br>
<br>(f) Service Not Covered.—(1) A cost-of-living allowance may not be paid a member under this section for the days authorized for travel of the member in connection with a permanent change of duty station.
<br>
<br>(2) A member of a reserve component is not eligible for a cost-of-living allowance under this section unless the member is on active duty under a call or order to active duty that—
<br>
<br>(A) specifies a period of 140 days or more; or
<br>
<br>(B) states that the call or order to active duty is in support of a contingency operation.

<br>
<br>In subsection (a), the words "Subject to subsections (b) and (c) of this section," are inserted for clarity. The words "of an armed force" are inserted, since the source section, as originally enacted, did not apply to the Public Health Service or the Coast and Geodetic Survey. (See section 243 of the Armed Forces Reserve Act of 1952 (66 Stat. 492).) The words "of the Army, or the Air Force, without specification of component" are inserted to reflect the definition of "reserve component" in section 102(k) of the source statute. That definition is executed throughout this revised title. For that reason, the words "but not as a member of the Army without specification of component or the Air Force without specification of component, in section 255(a)(2) of existing title 37", are omitted, and since those categories are excluded by the words "member of a reserve component". The words "of a reserve component", in section 255(a)(3) of existing title 37, are omitted, since the Ready Reserve cannot be in anything other than a reserve component.
<br>
<br>In subsection (b), the words "heretofore or hereafter" are omitted as surplusage.
<br>
<br>In subsection (c), the words "An officer" are substituted for the words "any individual", since the revised section applies only to officers.
<br>
<br>In subsection (d), the words "who is in pay grade O–1, O–2, or O–3" are substituted for the words "is receiving the pay of the junior assistant, assistant, or senior assistant grade" to reflect current terminology. (See chapter 3 of this revised title.) The last sentence is substituted for section 214 (words following semicolon) of title 14.
<br>
<br>In subsection (e), the words "as a temporary officer" are inserted for clarity. The words "5596 or" are substituted for section 302(f) of the Act of August 7, 1947, cited above.

<br>§418. Clothing allowance: enlisted members
<br>
<br>(a) The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security, with respect to the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in the Navy, may prescribe the quantity and kind of clothing to be furnished annually to an enlisted member of the armed forces or the National Guard, and may prescribe the amount of a cash allowance to be paid to such a member if clothing is not so furnished to him.
<br>
<br>(b) In determining the quantity and kind of clothing or allowances to be furnished pursuant to regulations prescribed under this section to persons employed as National Guard technicians under section 709 of title 32, the Secretary of Defense shall take into account the requirement under subsection (b) of such section for such persons to wear a uniform.
<br>
<br>(c) A uniform allowance may not be paid, and uniforms may not be furnished, under section 1593 of title 10 or section 5901 of title 5 to a person referred to in subsection (b) for a period of employment referred to in that subsection for which clothing is furnished or a uniform allowance is paid under this section.
<br>
<br>(d)(1) In the case of athletic footwear needed by members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Space Force upon their initial entry into the armed forces, the Secretary of Defense shall furnish such footwear directly to the members instead of providing a cash allowance to the members for the purchase of such footwear.
<br>
<br>(2) In procuring athletic footwear to comply with paragraph (1), the Secretary of Defense shall—
<br>
<br>(A) procure athletic footwear that complies with the requirements of section 2533a of title 10, without regard to the applicability of any simplified acquisition threshold under chapter 137 of title 10 (or any other provision of law); and
<br>
<br>(B) procure additional athletic footwear, for two years following the date of the enactment of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, that is necessary to provide a member described in paragraph (1) with sufficient choices in athletic shoes so as to minimize the incidence of athletic injuries and potential unnecessary harm and risk to the safety and well-being of members in initial entry training.
<br>
<br>(3) This subsection does not prohibit the provision of a cash allowance to a member described in paragraph (1) for the purchase of athletic footwear if such footwear—
<br>
<br>(A) is medically required to meet unique physiological needs of the member; and
<br>
<br>(B) cannot be met with athletic footwear that complies with the requirements of this subsection.
<br>
<br>(4) This subsection does not apply to the furnishing of athletic footwear to members of the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marine Corps, or the Space Force upon their initial entry into the armed forces, or prohibit the provision of a cash allowance to such members for such purpose, if the Secretary of Defense determines that compliance with paragraph (2) would result in a sole source contract for procurement of athletic footwear for the purpose stated in paragraph (1) because there would be only a sole certified source of supply for such footwear.
<br>
<br>(5) The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that all procurements of athletic footwear to which this subsection applies are made using firm fixed price contracts.
