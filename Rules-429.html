<br>(5) In determining whether to arrange a sale of assets and assumption of liabilities or an acquisition or a merger under the authority of paragraph (2) or (3), the Corporation may solicit such offers or proposals as are practicable from any prospective purchasers or merger partners it determines, in its sole discretion, are both qualified and capable of acquiring the assets and liabilities of the bank in default or the bank in danger of default.
<br>
<br>(6)(A) If, after receiving offers, the offer presenting the lowest expense to the Corporation, that is in a form and with conditions acceptable to the Corporation (hereinafter referred to as the "lowest acceptable offer"), is from an offeror that is not an existing in-State bank of the same type as the bank that is in default or is in danger of default (or, where the bank is an insured bank other than a mutual savings bank, the lowest acceptable offer is not from an in-State holding company), the Corporation shall permit the offeror which made the initial lowest acceptable offer and each offeror who made an offer the estimated cost of which to the Corporation was within 15 per centum or $15,000,000, whichever is less, of the initial lowest acceptable offer to submit a new offer.
<br>
<br>(B) In considering authorizations under this subsection, the Corporation shall give consideration to the need to minimize the cost of financial assistance and to the maintenance of specialized depository institutions. The Corporation shall authorize transactions under this subsection considering the following priorities:
<br>
<br>(i) First, between depository institutions of the same type within the same State.
<br>
<br>(ii) Second, between depository institutions of the same type—
<br>
<br>(I) in different States which by statute specifically authorize such acquisitions; or
<br>
<br>(II) in the absence of such statutes, in different States which are contiguous.
<br>
<br>(iii) Third, between depository institutions of the same type in different States other than the States described in clause (ii).
<br>
<br>(iv) Fourth, between depository institutions of different types in the same State.
<br>
<br>(v) Fifth, between depository institutions of different types—
<br>
<br>(I) in different States which by statute specifically authorize such acquisitions; or
<br>
<br>(II) in the absence of such statutes, in different States which are contiguous.
<br>
<br>(vi) Sixth, between depository institutions of different types in different States other than the States described in clause (v).
<br>
<br>(C) Minority Bank Priority.—In the case of a minority-controlled bank, the Corporation shall seek an offer from other minority-controlled banks before proceeding with the bidding priorities set forth in subparagraph (B).
<br>
<br>(D) In determining the cost of offers and reoffers, the Corporation's calculations and estimations shall be determinative. The Corporation may set reasonable time limits on offers and reoffers.
<br>
<br>(7) No sale may be made under the provisions of paragraph (2) or (3)—
<br>
<br>(A) which would result in a monopoly, or which would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or to attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any part of the United States;
<br>
<br>(B) whose effect in any section of the country may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly, or which in any other manner would be in restraint of trade, unless the Corporation finds that the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transactions are clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served; or
<br>
<br>(C) if in the opinion of the Corporation the acquisition threatens the safety and soundness of the acquirer or does not result in the future viability of the resulting depository institution.
<br>
<br>(8) As used in this subsection—
<br>
<br>(A) the term "in-State depository institution or in-State holding company" means an existing insured depository institution currently operating in the State in which the bank in default or the bank in danger of default is chartered or a company that is operating an insured depository institution subsidiary in the State in which the bank in default or the bank in danger of default is chartered;

<br>
<br>(ii) an acquisition of assets or assumption of liabilities;
<br>
<br>(iii) a merger or consolidation; or
<br>
<br>(iv) any similar transaction;

<br>
<br>(D) the term "subsidiary" has the meaning given to such term in section 1841(d) of this title.
<br>

<br>
<br>(12) Acquisition of minority bank by minority bank holding company without regard to asset size.—
<br>
<br>(A) In general.—For the purpose of ensuring continued minority control of a minority-controlled bank, paragraphs (2) and (3) shall apply with respect to the acquisition of a minority-controlled bank by an out-of-State minority-controlled depository institution or depository institution holding company without regard to the fact that the total assets of such minority-controlled bank are less than $500,000,000.
<br>

<br>
<br>The powers conferred on the Board of Directors and the Corporation by this section to take action to reopen an insured depository institution in default or to avert the default of an insured depository institution may be used with respect to an insured branch of a foreign bank if, in the judgment of the Board of Directors, the public interest in avoiding the default of such branch substantially outweighs any additional risk of loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund which the exercise of such powers would entail.

<br>(i) Troubled condition criteria
<br>
<br>The Corporation determines—
<br>
<br>(I) that grounds for appointment of a conservator or receiver exist or likely will exist in the future unless the member's tangible capital is increased;
<br>
<br>(II) that it is unlikely that the member can achieve positive tangible capital without assistance; and
<br>
<br>(III) that providing assistance pursuant to the member's proposal would be likely to lessen the risk to the Corporation.
<br>(ii) Other criteria
<br>
<br>The member meets the following criteria:
<br>
<br>(I) Before August 9, 1989, the member was solvent under applicable regulatory accounting principles but had negative tangible capital.
<br>
<br>(II) The member's negative tangible capital position is substantially attributable to its participation in acquisition and merger transactions that were instituted by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board or the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation for supervisory reasons.
<br>
<br>(III) The member is a qualified thrift lender (as defined in section 1467a(m) of this title) or would be a qualified thrift lender if commercial real estate owned and nonperforming commercial loans acquired in acquisition and merger transactions that were instituted by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board or the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation for supervisory reasons were excluded from the member's total assets.
<br>
<br>(IV) The appropriate Federal banking agency has determined that the member's management is competent and has complied with applicable laws, rules, and supervisory directives and orders.
<br>
<br>(V) The member's management did not engage in insider dealing or speculative practices or other activities that jeopardized the member's safety and soundness or contributed to its impaired capital position.
<br>
<br>(VI) The member's offices are located in an economically depressed region.
<br>(B) Corporation consideration of assistance proposal
<br>
<br>If a member meets the requirements of clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (A), the Corporation shall consider providing direct financial assistance.
<br>(C) "Economically depressed region" defined
<br>
<br>For purposes of this paragraph, the term "economically depressed region" means any geographical region which the Corporation determines by regulation to be a region within which real estate values have suffered serious decline due to severe economic conditions, such as a decline in energy or agricultural values or prices.

<br>
<br>Pub. L. 102–242, title I, §143, Dec. 19, 1991, 105 Stat. 2281, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(a) In General.—It is the sense of the Congress that the Federal banking agencies should facilitate early resolution of troubled insured depository institutions whenever feasible if early resolution would have the least possible long-term cost to the deposit insurance fund, consistent with the least-cost and prompt corrective action provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act [12 U.S.C. 1811 et seq.].
<br>
<br>"(b) General Principles.—In encouraging the Federal banking agencies to pursue early resolution strategies, the Congress contemplates that any resolution transaction under section 13(c) of that Act [12 U.S.C. 1823(c)] would observe the following general principles:
<br>
<br>"(1) Competitive negotiation.—The transaction should be negotiated competitively, taking into account the value of expediting the process.
<br>
<br>"(2) Resulting institution adequately capitalized.—Any insured depository institution created or assisted in the transaction (hereafter the 'resulting institution') and any institution acquiring the troubled institution should meet all applicable minimum capital standards.
<br>
<br>"(3) Substantial private investment.—The transaction should involve substantial private investment.
<br>
<br>"(4) Concessions.—Preexisting owners and debtholders of any troubled institution or its holding company should make substantial concessions.
<br>
<br>"(5) Qualified management.—Directors and senior management of the resulting institution should be qualified to perform their duties, and should not include individuals substantially responsible for the troubled institution's problems.
<br>
<br>"(6) FDIC's participation.—The transaction should give the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation an opportunity to participate in the success of the resulting institution.
<br>
<br>"(7) Structure of transaction.—The transaction should, insofar as practical, be structured so that—
<br>
<br>"(A) the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation—
<br>
<br>"(i) does not acquire a significant proportion of the troubled institution's problem assets;
<br>
<br>"(ii) succeeds to the interests of the troubled institution's preexisting owners and debtholders in proportion to the assistance the Corporation provides; and
<br>
<br>"(iii) limits the Corporation's assistance in term and amount; and
<br>
<br>"(B) new investors share risk with the Corporation.
<br>
<br>"(c) Report.—Two years after the date of enactment of this Act [Dec. 19, 1991], the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation shall submit a report to Congress analyzing the effect of early resolution on the deposit insurance funds."
