<br>6	But Banaias, and Jaziel the priests, to sound the trumpet continually before the ark of the covenant of the Lord.
<br>7	In that day David made Asaph the chief to give praise to the Lord with his brethren.
<br>8	Praise ye the Lord, and call upon his name: make known his doings among the nations.
<br>9	Sing to him, yea, sing praises to him: and relate all his wondrous works.
<br>10	Praise ye his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice, that seek the Lord.
<br>11	Seek ye the Lord, and his power: seek ye his face evermore.
<br>12	Remember his wonderful works, which he hath done: his signs, and the judgments of his mouth.
<br>13	O ye seed of Israel his servants, ye children of Jacob his chosen.
<br>14	He is the Lord our God: his judgments are in all the earth.
<br>15	Remember for ever his covenant: the word, which he commanded to a thousand generations.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>16	The covenant which he made with Abra- ham: and his oath to Isaac.
<br>17	And he appointed the same to   Jacob for a precept: and to Israel for an everlasting covenant:
<br>18	Saying: To thee will I give the land of Chanaan: the lot of your inheritance.
<br>19	When they were but a small number: very few and sojourners in it.
<br>20	And they passed from nation to nation: and from a kingdom to another people.
<br>21	He suffered no man to do them wrong: and reproved kings for their sake.
<br>22	Touch not my anointed: and do no evil to my prophets.
<br>23	Sing ye to the Lord, all the earth: shew forth from day to day his salvation.
<br>24	Declare his glory among the Gentiles: his wonders among all people.
<br>25	For the Lord is great and exceedingly to be praised: and he is to be feared above all gods.
<br>26	For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the Lord made the heavens.
<br>27	Praise and magnificence are before him: strength and joy in his place.
<br>28	Bring ye to the Lord, O ye families of the nations: bring ye to the Lord glory and empire. 29 Give to the Lord glory to his name, bring up sacrifice, and come ye in his sight: and adore
<br>the Lord in holy becomingness.
<br>30	Let all the earth be moved at his presence: for he hath founded the world immoveable.
<br>31	Let the heavens rejoice, and the earth be glad: and let them say among the nations: The Lord hath reigned.
<br>32	Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all things that are in them.
<br>33	Then shall the trees of the wood give praise before the Lord: because he is come to judge the
<br> 
<br>earth.
<br>34	Give ye glory to the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.
<br>35	And say ye: Save us, O God our savior: and gather us together, and deliver us from the na- tions, that we may give glory to thy holy name, and may rejoice in singing thy praises.
<br>36	Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel from eternity to eternity: and let all the people say Amen, and a hymn to God.
<br>37	So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, Asaph and his brethren to minister in the presence of the ark continu- ally day by day, and in their courses.
<br>38	And Obededom, with his brethren sixty- eight: and Obededom the son of Idithun, and Hosa he appointed to be porters.
<br>39	And Sadoc the priest, and his brethren priests, before the tabernacle of the Lord in the high place, which was in Gabaon.
<br>40	That they should offer holocausts to the Lord upon the altar of holocausts continually, morning and evening, according to all that is written in the law of the Lord, which he com- manded Israel.
<br>41	And after him Heman, and Idithun, and the rest that were chosen, every one by his name to give praise to the Lord: because his mercy endureth for ever.
<br>42	And Heman and Idithun sounded the trum- pet, and played on the cymbals, and all kinds of musical instruments to sing praises to God: and the sons of Idithun he made porters.
<br>43	And all the people returned to their houses: and David to bless also his own house.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 17
<br>Now when David was dwelling in his house, he said to Nathan the prophet: Behold I dwell in a house of cedar: and the ark of the covenant of the Lord is under skins.
<br>2	And Nathan said to David: Do all that is in thy heart: for God is with thee.
<br>3	Now that night the word of God came to Nathan, saying:
<br>4	Go, and speak to David my servant: Thus saith the Lord: Thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in.
<br>5	For I have not remained in a house from the time that I brought up Israel, to this day: but I have been always changing places in a taberna- cle, and in a tent,
<br>6	Abiding with all Israel. Did I ever speak to any one, of all the judges of Israel whom I charged to feed my people, saying: Why have you not built me a house of cedar?
<br>7	Now therefore thus shalt thou say to my servant David: Thus saith the Lord of hosts: I took thee from the pastures, from following the flock, that thou shouldst be ruler of my people Israel.
<br>8	And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast gone: and have slain all thy enemies before thee, and have made thee a name like that of one of the great ones that are renowned in the earth.
<br>9	And I have given a place my people Israel: they shall be planted, and shall dwell therein, and shall be moved no more, neither shall the children of iniquity waste them, as at the begin- ning,
<br>10	Since the days that I gave judges to my people Israel, and have humbled all thy enemies. And I declare to thee, that the Lord will build thee a house.
<br> 
<br>11	And when thou shalt have ended thy days to go to thy fathers, I will raise up thy seed af- ter thee, which shall be of thy sons: and I will establish his kingdom.
<br>12	He shall build me a house, and I will es- tablish his throne for ever.
<br>13	I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee.
<br>14	But I will settle him in my house, and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be most firm for ever.
<br>15	According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to David. 16 And king David came and sat before the Lord, and said: Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my house, that thou shouldst give such
<br>things to me?
<br>17	But even this hath seemed little in thy sight, and therefore thou hast also spoken con- cerning the house of thy servant for the time to come: and hast made me remarkable above all men, O Lord God.
<br>18	What can David add more, seeing thou hast thus glorified thy servant, and known him? 19 O Lord, for thy servant’s sake, according to thy own heart, thou hast shewn all this mag- nificence, and wouldst have all the great things
<br>to be known.
<br>20	O Lord there is none like thee: and here is no other God beside thee, of all whom we have heard of with our ears.
<br>21	For what other nation is there upon earth like thy people Israel, whom God went to deliver, and make a people for himself, and by his great- ness and terrors cast out nations before their face whom he had delivered out of Egypt?
<br>22	And thou hast made thy people Israel to be thy own people for ever, and thou, O Lord,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>art become their God.
<br>23	Now therefore, O Lord, let the word which thou hast spoken to thy servant, and concerning his house, be established for ever, and do as thou hast said.
<br>24	And let thy name remain and be magnified for ever: and let it be said: The Lord of hosts is God of Israel, and the house of David his servant remaineth before him.
<br>25	For thou, O Lord my God, hast revealed to the ear of thy servant, that thou wilt build him a house: and therefore thy servant hath found confidence to pray before thee.
<br>26	And now O Lord, thou art God: and thou hast promised to thy servant such great benefits. 27 And thou hast begun to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be always before thee: for seeing thou blessest it, O Lord, it shall be
<br>blessed for ever.
<br>
<br>Chapter 18
<br>And it came to pass after this, that David de- feated the Philistines, and humbled them, and took away Geth, and her daughters out of the hands of the Philistines,
<br>2	And he defeated Moab, and the Moabites were made David’s servants, and brought him gifts.
<br>3	At that time David defeated also Adarezer king of Soba of the land of Hemath, when he went to extend his dominions as far as the river Euphrates.
<br>4	And David took from him a thousand char- iots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen, and he houghed all the char- iot horses, only a hundred chariots, which he re- served for himself.
<br>5	And the Syrians of Damascus came also to
<br> 
<br>help Adarezer king of Soba: and David slew of them likewise two and twenty thousand men.
<br>6	And he put a garrison in Damascus, that Syria also should serve him, and bring gifts. And the Lord assisted him in all things to which he went.
<br>7	And David took the golden quivers which the servants of Adarezer had, and he brought them to Jerusalem.
<br>8	Likewise out of Thebath and Chun, cities of Adarezer, he brought very much brass, of which Solomon made the brazen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.
<br>9	Now when Thou king of Hemath heard that David had defeated all the army of Adarezer king of Soba,
<br>10	He sent Adoram his son to king David to desire peace of him, and to congratulate him that he had defeated and overthrown Adarezer: for Thou was an enemy to Adarezer.
<br>11	And all the vessels of gold, and silver and brass king David consecrated to the Lord, with the silver and gold which he had taken from all the nations, as well from Edom, and from Moab, and from the sons of Ammon, as from the Philistines, and from Amalec.
<br>12	And Abisai the son of Sarvia slew of the Edomites in the vale of the saltpits, eighteen thousand:
<br>13	And he put a garrison in Edom, that Edom should serve David: and the Lord preserved David in all things to which he went.
<br>14	So David reigned over all Israel, and exe- cuted judgment and justice among all his people. 15 And Joab the son of Sarvia was over the army, and Josaphat the son of Ahilud recorder. 16 And Sadoc the son of Achitob, and Achim- elech the son of Abiathar, were the priests: and
<br>Susa, scribe.
<br>17 And Banaias the  son of Joiada was  over
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>the bands of the Cerethi, and the Phelethi: and the sons of David were chief about the king.
<br>
<br>Chapter 19
<br>Now it came to pass that Naas the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.
<br>2	And David said: I will shew kindness to Hanon the son of Naas: for his father did a favour tome. And David sent messengers to comfort him upon the death of his father. But when they were come into the land of the children of Ammon, to comfort Hanon,
<br>3	The princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanon: Thou thinkest perhaps that David to do honour to thy father hath sent comforters to thee: and thou dost not take notice, that his servants are come to thee to consider, and search, and spy out thy land.
<br>4	Wherefore Hanon shaved the heads and beards of the servants of David, and cut away their garments from the buttocks to the feet, and sent them away.
<br>5	And when they were gone, they sent word to David, who sent to meet them (for they had suf- fered a great affront) and ordered them to stay at Jericho till their beards grew and then to return. 6 And when the children of Ammon saw that they had done an injury to David, Hanon and the rest of the people sent a thousand talents of silver, to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia and out of Syria Maacha, and out
<br>of Soba.
<br>7	And they hired two and thirty thousand chariots, and the king of Maacha, with his peo- ple. And they came and camped over against Medaba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together out of their cities, and came
<br> 
<br>to battle.
<br>8	And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the army of valiant men:
<br>9	And the children of Ammon came out and put their army in array before the gate of the city: and the kings, that were come to their aid, stood apart in the field.
<br>10	Wherefore Joab understanding that the battle was set against him before and behind, chose out the bravest men of all Israel, and marched against the Syrians,
<br>11	And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abisai his brother, and they went against the children of Ammon.
<br>12	And he said: If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the chil- dren of Ammon be too strong for thee, I will help thee.
<br>13	Be of good courage and let us behave our- selves manfully for our people, and for the cities of our God: and the Lord will do that which is good in his sight.
<br>14	So Joab and the people that were with him, went against the Syrians to the battle: and he put them to flight.
<br>15	And the children of Ammon seeing that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled from Abisai his brother, and went into the city: and Joab also returned to Jerusalem.
<br>16	But the Syrians seeing that they had fallen before Israel, sent messengers, and brought to them the Syrians that were beyond the river: and Sophach, general of the army of Adarezer, was their leader.
<br>17	And it was told David, and he gathered together all Israel, and passed the Jordan, and came upon them, and put his army in array against them, and they fought with him.
<br>18	But the Syrian fled before Israel: and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand char-
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>iots, and forty thousand footmen, and Sophach the general of the army.
<br>19	And when the servants of Adarezer saw themselves overcome by Israel, they went over to David, and served him: and Syria would not help the children of Ammon any more.
<br>
<br>Chapter 20
<br>And it came to pass after the course of a year, at the time that kings go out to battle, Joab gath- ered together an army and the strength of the troops, and wasted the land of the children of Ammon: and went and besieged Rabba. But David stayed at Jerusalem, when Joab smote Rabba, and destroyed it.
<br>2	And David took the crown of Melchom from his head, and found in it a talent weight of gold, and most precious stones, and he made himself a diadem of it: he took also the spoils of the city which were very great.
<br>3	And the people that were therein he brought out: and made harrows, and sleds, and chariots of iron to go over them, so that they were cut and bruised to pieces: in this manner David dealt with all the cities of the children of Ammon: and he returned with all his people to Jerusalem.
<br>4	After this there arose a war at Gazer against the Philistines: in which Sabachai the Husathite slew Saphai of the race of Raphaim, and humbled them.
<br>5	Another battle also was fought against the Philistines, in which Adeodatus the son of Saltus a Bethlehemite slew the brother of Goliath the Gethite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.
<br>6	There was another battle also in Geth, in which there was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on each
<br> 
<br>hand and foot: who also was born of the stock of Rapha.
<br>7	He reviled Israel: but Jonathan the son of Samaa the brother of David slew him. These were the sons of Rapha in Geth, who fell by the hand of David and his servants.
<br>
<br>Chapter 21
<br>And Satan rose up against Israel: and moved David to number Israel.
<br>2	And David said to Joab, and to the rulers of the people: Go, and number Israel from Bersabee even to Dan, and bring me the number of them that I may know it.
<br>3	And Joab answered: The Lord make his peo- ple a hundred times more than they are: but, my lord the king, are they not all thy servants: why doth my lord seek this thing, which may be im- puted as a sin to Israel?
<br>4	But the king’s word rather prevailed: and Joab departed, and went through all Israel: and returned to Jerusalem.
<br>5	And he gave David the number of them, whom he had surveyed: and all the number of Israel was found to be eleven hundred thousand men that drew the sword: and of Juda four hun- dred and seventy thousand fighting men.
<br>6	But Levi and Benjamin he did not number: for Joab unwillingly executed the king’s orders. 7 And God was displeased with this thing that
<br>was commanded: and he struck Israel.
<br>8	And David said to God: I have sinned ex- ceedingly in doing this: I beseech thee take away the iniquity of thy servant, for I have done fool- ishly.
<br>9	And the Lord spoke to Gad the seer of David, saying:
<br>10	Go, and speak to David, and tell him: Thus
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>saith the Lord: I give thee the choice of three things: choose one which thou wilt, and I will do it to thee.
<br>11	And when Gad was come to David, he said to him: Thus saith the Lord: choose which thou wilt:
<br>12	Either three years famine: or three months to flee from thy enemies, and not to be able to escape their sword: or three days to have the sword of the Lord, and pestilence in the land, and the angel of the Lord destroying in all the coasts of Israel: now therefore see what I shall answer him who sent me.
<br>13	And David said to Gad: I am on every side in a great strait: but it is better for me to fall into the hands of the Lord, for his mercies are many, than into the hands of men.
<br>14	So the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel. And there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.
<br>15	And he sent an angel to Jerusalem, to strike it: and as he was striking it, the Lord beheld, and took pity for the greatness of the evil:  and said to the angel that destroyed: It is enough, now stop thy hand. And the angel of the Lord stood by the thrashingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.
<br>16	And David lifting up his eyes, saw the angel of the Lord standing between heaven and earth, with a drawn sword in his hand, turned against Jerusalem: and both he and the ancients clothed in haircloth, fell down flat on the ground.
<br>17	And David said to God: Am not I he that commanded the people to be numbered? It is I that have sinned: it is I that have done the evil: but as for this flock, what hath it deserved? O Lord my God, let thy hand be turned, I beseech thee, upon me, and upon my father’s house: and let not thy people be destroyed.
<br>18	And the angel of the Lord commanded Gad to tell David, to go up, and build an altar to the Lord God in the thrashingfloor of Ornan the
<br> 
<br>Jebusite.
<br>19	And David went up, according to the word of Gad, which he spoke to him in the name of the Lord.
<br>20	Now when Ornan looked up, and saw the angel, he and his four sons hid themselves: for at that time he was thrashing wheat in the floor. 21 And as David was coming to Ornan, Ornan saw him, and went out of the thrashingfloor to meet him, and bowed down to him with his face
<br>to the ground.
<br>22	And David said to him: Give me this place of thy thrashingfloor,  that I may build therein an altar to the Lord: but thou shalt take of me as much money as it is worth, that the plague may cease from the people.
<br>23	And Ornan said to David: Take it, and let my lord the king do all that pleaseth him: and moreover the oxen also I give for a holocaust, and the drays for wood, and the wheat for the sacrifice: I will give it all willingly.
<br>24	And king David said to him: It shall not be so, but I will give thee money as much as it is worth: for I must not take it from thee, and so offer to the Lord holocausts free cost.
<br>25	So David gave to Ornan for the place, six hundred sicles of gold of just weight.
<br>26	And he built there an altar to the Lord: and he offered holocausts, and peace offerings, and he called upon the Lord, and he heard him by sending fire from heaven upon the altar of the holocaust.
<br>27	And the Lord commanded the angel: and he put up his sword again into the sheath.
<br>28	And David seeing that the Lord had heard him in the thrashingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, forthwith offered victims there.
<br>29	But the tabernacle of the Lord, which Moses made in the desert, and the altar of holo- causts, was at that time in the high place of
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Gabaon.
<br>30	And David could not go to the altar there to pray to God: for he was seized with an ex- ceeding great fear, seeing the sword of the angel of the Lord.
<br>
<br>Chapter 22
<br>Then David said: This is the house of God, And this is the altar for the holocaust of Israel.
<br>2	And he commanded to gather together all the proselytes of the land of Israel, and out of them he appointed stonecutters to hew stones and polish them, to build the house of God.
<br>3	And David prepared in abundance iron for the nails of the gates, and for the closures and joinings: and of brass an immense weight.
<br>4	And the cedar trees were without number, which the Sidonians, and Tyrians brought to David.
<br>5	And David said: Solomon my son is very young and tender, and the house which I would have to be built to the Lord, must be such as to be renowned in all countries: therefore I will prepare him necessaries. And therefore before his death he prepared all the charges.
<br>6	And he called for Solomon his son: and com- manded him to build a house to the Lord the God of Israel.
<br>7	And David said to Solomon: My son, it was my desire to have built a house to the name of the Lord my God.
<br>8	But the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Thou hast shed much blood, and fought many battles, so thou cannot not build house to my name, after shedding so much blood before me: 9 The son, that shall be born to thee, shall be
<br>a most quiet man: for I will make him rest from all his enemies round about: and therefore he
<br> 
<br>shall be called Peaceable: and I will give peace and quietness to Israel all his days.
<br>10	He shall build a house to my name, and he shall be a son to me, and I will be a father to him: and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever.
<br>11	Now then, my son, the Lord be with thee, and do thou prosper, and build the house to the Lord thy God, as he hath spoken of thee.
<br>12	The Lord also give thee wisdom and under- standing, that thou mayest be able to rule Israel, and to keep the law of the Lord thy God.
<br>13	For then thou shalt be able to prosper, if thou keep the commandments, and judgments, which the Lord commanded Moses to teach Is- rael: take courage and act manfully, fear not, nor be dismayed.
<br>14	Behold I in my poverty have prepared the charges of the house of the Lord, of gold a hun- dred thousand talents, and of silver a million of talents: but of brass, and of iron there is no weight, for the abundance surpasseth all ac- count: timber also and stones I have prepared for all the charges.
<br>15	Thou hast also workmen in abundance, hewers of stones, and masons, and carpenters, and of all trades the most skilful in their work,
<br>16	In gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, whereof there is no number. Arise then, and be doing, and the Lord will be with thee.
<br>17	David also charged all the princes of Israel, to help Solomon his son,
<br>18	Saying: You see, that the Lord your God is with you, and hath given you rest round about, and hath delivered all your enemies into your hands, and the land is subdued before the Lord, and before his people.
<br>19	Give therefore your hearts and your souls, to seek the Lord your God and arise, and build a sanctuary to the Lord God, that the ark of
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>the covenant of the Lord, and the vessels con- secrated to the Lord, may be brought into the house, which is built to the name of the Lord.
<br>
<br>Chapter 23
<br>David being old and full of days, made Solomon his son king over Israel.
<br>2	And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, and the priests and Levites.
<br>3	And the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years, and upwards: and there were found of them thirty-eight thousand men.
<br>4	Of these twenty-four thousand were chosen, and distributed unto the ministry of the house of the Lord: and six thousand were the overseers and judges.
<br>5	Moreover four thousand were porters: and as many singers singing to the Lord with the instruments, which he had made to sing with.
<br>6	And David distributed them into courses by the families of the sons of Levi, to wit, of Gerson, and of Caath, and of Merari.
<br>7	The sons of Gerson were Leedan and Semei.
<br>8	The sons of Leedan: the chief Jahiel, and Zethan, and Joel, three.
<br>9	The sons of Semei: Salomith, and Hosiel, and Aran, three: these were the heads of the families of Leedan.
<br>10	And the sons of Semei were Leheth, and Ziza, and Jaus, and Baria: these were the sons of Semei, four.
<br>11	And Leheth was the first, Ziza the second: but Jaus and Baria had not many children, and therefore they were counted in one family, and in one house.
<br>12	The sons of Caath were Amram, and Isaar, Hebron, and Oziel, four.
<br>13	The sons of Amram, Aaron, and Moses.
<br> 
<br>And Aaron was separated to minister in the holy of holies, he and his sons for ever, and to burn incense before the Lord, according to his cere- monies, and to bless his name for ever.
<br>14	The sons also of Moses, the man of God, were numbered in the tribe of Levi.
<br>15	The sons of Moses were Gersom and Eliezer:
<br>16	The sons of Gersom: Subuel the first.
<br>17	And the sons of Eliezer were: Rohobia the first: and Eliezer had no more sons. But the sons of Rohobia were multiplied exceedingly.
<br>18	The sons of Isaar: Salomith the first.
<br>19	The sons of Hebron: Jeriau the first, Amarias the second, Jahaziel the third, Jec- maam the fourth.
<br>20	The sons of Oziel: Micha the first, Jesia the second.
<br>21	The sons of Merari: Moholi, and Musi. The sons of Moholi: Eleazar and Cis.
<br>22	And Eleazar died, and had no sons but daughters: and the sons of Cis their brethren took them.
<br>23	The sons of Musi: Moholi, and Eder, and Jerimoth, three.
<br>24	These are the sons of Levi in their kindreds and families, princes by their courses, and the number of every head that did the works of the ministry of the house of the Lord from twenty years old and upward.
<br>25	For David said: The Lord the God of Israel hath given rest to his people, and a habitation in Jerusalem for ever.
<br>26	And it shall not be the office of the Levites to carry any more the tabernacle, and all the vessels for the service thereof.
<br>27	So according to the last precepts of David, the sons of Levi are to be numbered from twenty years old and upward.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>28	And they are to be under the hand of the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the Lord, in the porches, and in the chambers, and in the place of purification, and in the sanctuary, and in all the works of the ministry of the temple of the Lord.
<br>29	And the priests have the charge of the loaves of proposition, and of the sacrifice of fine flour, and of the unleavened cakes, and of the fry- ingpan, and of the roasting, and of every weight and measure.
<br>30	And the Levites are to stand in the morning to give thanks, and to sing praises to the Lord: and in like manner in the evening,
<br>31	As well in the oblation of the holocausts of the Lord, as in the sabbaths and in the new moons, and the rest of the solemnities, accord- ing to the number and ceremonies prescribed for every thing, continually before the Lord.
<br>32	And let them keep the observances of the tabernacle of the covenant, and the ceremonies of the sanctuary, and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren, that they may minister in the house of the Lord.
<br>
<br>Chapter 24
<br>Now these were the divisions of the sons of Aaron: The sons of Aaron: Nadab, and Abiu, and Eleazar, and Ithamar.
<br>2	But Nadab and Abiu died before their fa- ther, and had no children: so Eleazar, and Ithamar did the office of the priesthood.
<br>3	And David distributed them, that is, Sadoc of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their courses and min- istry.
<br>4	And there were found many more of the sons of Eleazar among the principal men, than of the
<br> 
<br>sons of Ithamar. And he divided them so, that there were of the sons of Eleazar, sixteen chief men by their families: and of the sons of Ithamar eight by their families and houses.
<br>5	And he divided both the families one with the other by lot: for there were princes of the sanctuary, and princes of God, both of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.
<br>6	And Semeias the son of Nathanael the scribe a Levite, wrote them down before the king and the princes, and Sadoc the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the princes also of the priestly and Levitical families: one house, which was over the rest, of Eleazar: and another house, which had the rest under it, of Ithamar.
<br>7	Now the first lot came forth to Joiarib, the second to Jedei,
<br>8	The third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim, 9 The fifth to Melchia, the sixth to Maiman, 10 The seventh to Accos, the eighth to Abia, 11 The ninth to Jesua, the tenth to Sechenia,
<br>12	The eleventh to Eliasib, the twelfth to Jacim,
<br>13	The thirteenth to Hoppha, the fourteenth to Isbaab,
<br>14	The fifteenth to Belga, the sixteenth to Em- mer,
<br>15	The seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Aphses,
<br>16	The nineteenth to Pheteia, the twentieth to Hezechiel,
<br>17	The one and twentieth to Jachin, the two and twentieth to Gamul,
<br>18	The three and twentieth to Dalaiau, the four and twentieth to Maaziau.
<br>19	These are their courses according to their ministries, to come into the house of the Lord, and according to their manner under the hand of Aaron their father: as the Lord the God of Israel had commanded.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>20	Now of the rest of the sons of Levi, there was of the sons of Amram, Subael: and of the sons of Subael, Jehedeia.
<br>21	Also of the sons of Rohobia the chief Jesias.
<br>22	And the son of Isaar Salemoth, and the son of Salemoth Jahath:
<br>23	And his son Jeriau the first, Amarias the second, Jahaziel the third, Jecmaan the fourth. 24 The son of Oziel, Micha: the son of Micha,
<br>Samir.
<br>25	The brother of Micha, Jesia: and the son of Jesia, Zacharias.
<br>26	The sons of Merari: Moholi and Musi: the son of Oziau:  Benno.
<br>27	The son also of Merari Oziau, and Soam, and Zacchur, and Hebri.
<br>28	And the son of Moholi: Eleazar, who had no sons.
<br>29	And the son of Cis, Jeramael.
<br>30	The sons of Musi: Moholi, Eder, and Jer- imoth. These are the sons of Levi according to the houses of their families.
<br>31	And they also cast lots over against their brethren the sons of Aaron before David the king, and Sadoc, and Ahimelech, and the princes of the priestly and Levitical families, both the el- der and the younger. The lot divided all equally.
<br>
<br>Chapter 25
<br>Moreover David and the chief officers of the army separated for the ministry the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Idithun: to prophesy with harps, and with psalteries, and with cymbals according to their number serving in their ap- pointed office.
<br>2	Of the sons of Asaph: Zacchur, and Joseph, and Nathania, and Asarela, sons of Asaph: un- der the hand of Asaph prophesying near the
<br> 
<br>king.
<br>3	And of Idithun: the sons of Idithun, Godolias, Sori, Jeseias, and Hasabias, and Mathathias, under the hand of their father Idithun, who prophesied with a harp to give thanks and to praise the Lord.
<br>4	Of Heman also: the sons of Heman, Bocciau, Mathaniau, Oziel, Subuel, and Jer- imoth, Hananias, Hanani, Eliatha, Geddelthi, and Romemthiezer, and Jesbacassa, Mellothi, Othir, Mahazioth:
<br>5	All these were the sons of Heman the seer of the king in the words of God, to lift up the horn: and God gave to Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.
<br>6	All these under their father’s hand were dis- tributed to sing in the temple of the Lord, with cymbals, and psalteries and harps, for the ser- vice of the house of the Lord near the king: to wit, Asaph, and Idithun, and Heman.
<br>7	And the number of them with their brethren, that taught the song of the Lord, all the teachers, were two hundred and eighty-eight.
<br>8	And they cast lots by their courses, the elder equally with the younger, the learned and the unlearned together.
<br>9	And the first lot came forth to Joseph, who was of Asaph. The second to Godolias, to him and his sons, and his brethren twelve.
<br>10	The third to Zachur, to his sons and his brethren twelve.
<br>11	The fourth to Isari, to his sons and his brethren twelve.
<br>12	The fifth to Nathania, to his sons and his brethren twelve.
<br>13	The sixth to Bocciau, to his sons and his brethren twelve.
<br>14	The seventh to Isreela, to his sons and his brethren twelve.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>15	The eighth to Jesaia, to his sons and his brethren twelve.
<br>16	The ninth to Mathanaias, to his sons and his brethren twelve.
<br>17	The tenth to Semeias, to his sons and his brethren twelve.
<br>18	The eleventh to Azareel, to his sons and his brethren twelve.
<br>19	The twelfth to Hasabia, to his sons and his brethren twelve.
<br>20	The thirteenth to Subael, to his sons and his brethren twelve.
<br>21	The fourteenth to Mathathias, to his sons and his brethren twelve.
<br>22	The fifteenth to Jerimoth, to his sons and his brethren twelve.
<br>23	The sixteenth to Hananias, to his sons and his brethren twelve.
<br>24	The seventeenth to Jesbacassa, to his sons and his brethren twelve.
<br>25	The eighteenth to Hanani, to his sons and his brethren twelve.
<br>26	The nineteenth to Mellothi, to his sons and his brethren twelve.
<br>27	The twentieth to Eliatha, to his sons and his brethren twelve.
<br>28	The one and twentieth to Othir, to his sons and his brethren twelve.
<br>29	The two and twentieth to Geddelthi, to his sons and his brethren twelve.
<br>30	The three and twentieth to Mahazioth, to his sons and his brethren twelve.
<br>31	The four and twentieth to Romemthiezer, to his sons and his brethren twelve.
<br>
<br>Chapter 26
<br>And the divisions of the porters: of the Corites Meselemia, the son of Core, of the sons of Asaph.
<br> 
<br>2	The sons of Meselemia: Zacharias the first- born, Jadihel the second, Zabadias the third, Jathanael the fourth,
<br>3	Elam the fifth, Johanan the sixth, Elioenai the seventh.
<br>4	And the sons of Obededom, Semeias the firstborn, Jozabad the second, Joaha the third, Sachar the fourth, Nathanael the fifth,
<br>5	Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh, Phollathi the eighth: for the Lord had blessed him.
<br>6	And to Semei his son were born sons, heads of their families: for they were men of great val- our.
<br>7	The sons then of Semeias were Othni, and Raphael, and Obed, Elizabad, and his brethren most valiant men: and Eliu, and Samachias.
<br>8	All these of the sons of Obededom: they, and their sons, and their brethren most able men for service, sixty-two of Obededom.
<br>9	And the sons of Meselemia, and their brethren strong men, were eighteen.
<br>10	And of Hosa, that is, of the sons of Merari: Semri the chief, (for he had not a firstborn, and therefore his father made him chief.)
<br>11	Helcias the second, Tabelias the third, Zacharias the fourth: all these the sons, and the brethren of Hosa, were thirteen.
<br>12	Among these were the divisions of the porters, so that the chiefs of the wards, as well as their brethren, always ministered in the house of the Lord.
<br>13	And they cast lots equally, both little and great, by their families for every one of the gates. 14 And the lot of the east fell to Selemias.
<br>But to his son Zacharias, a very wise and learned man, the north gate fell by lot.
<br>15	And to Obededom and his sons that to- wards the south: in which part of the house was the council of the ancients.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>16	To Sephim, and Hosa towards the west, by the gate which leadeth to the way of the ascent: ward against ward.
<br>17	Now towards the east were six Levites: and towards the north four a day: and towards the south likewise four a day: and where the council was, two and two.
<br>18	In the cells also of the porters toward the west four in the way: and two at every cell.
<br>19	These are the divisions of the porters of the sons of Core, and of Merari.
<br>20	Now Achias was over the treasures of the house of God, and the holy vessels.
<br>21	The sons of Ledan, the sons of Gersonni: of Ledan were heads of the families, of Ledan, and Gersonni, Jehieli.
<br>22	The sons of Jehieli: Zathan and Joel, his brethren over the treasures of the house of the Lord,
<br>23	With the Amramites, and Isaarites, and Hebronites, and Ozielites.
<br>24	And Subael the son of Gersom, the son of Moses, was chief over the treasures.
<br>25	His brethren also, Eliezer, whose son Ro- hobia, and his son Isaias, and his son Joram, and his son Zechri, and his son Selemith.
<br>26	Which Selemith and his brethren were over the treasures of the holy things, which king David, and the heads of families, and the cap- tains over thousands and over hundreds, and the captains of the host had dedicated,
<br>27	Out of the wars, and the spoils won in bat- tles, which they had consecrated to the building and furniture of the temple of the Lord.
<br>28	And all these things that Samuel the seer and Saul the son of Cis, and Abner the son of Ner, and Joab the son of Sarvia had sancti- fied: and whosoever had sanctified those things, they were under the hand of Selemith and his brethren.
<br> 
<br>29	But Chonenias and his sons were over the Isaarites, for the business abroad over Israel to teach them and judge them.
<br>30	And of the Hebronites Hasabias, and his brethren most able men, a thousand seven hun- dred had the charge over Israel beyond the Jor- dan westward, in all the works of the Lord, and for the service of the king.
<br>31	And the chief of the Hebronites was Je- ria according to their families and kindreds. In the fortieth year of the reign of David they were numbered, and there were found most valiant men in Jazer Galaad,
<br>32	And his brethren of stronger age, two thou- sand seven hundred chiefs of families. And king David made them rulers over the Rubenites and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasses, for all the service of God, and the king.
<br>
<br>Chapter 27
<br>Now the children of Israel according to their number, the heads of families, captains of thou- sands and of hundreds, and officers, that served the king according to their companies, who came in and went out every month in the year, under every chief were four and twenty thousand.
<br>2	Over the first company the first month Jes- boam, the son of Zabdiel was chief, and under him were four and twenty thousand.
<br>3	Of the sons of Phares, the chief of all the captains in the host in the first month.
<br>4	The company of the second month was under Dudia, an Ahohite, and after him was another named Macelloth, who commanded a part of the army of four and twenty thousand.
<br>5	And the captain of the third company for the third month, was Banaias the son of Joiada the priest: and in his division were four and twenty
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>thousand.
<br>6	This is that Banaias the most valiant among the thirty, and above the thirty. And Amizabad his son commanded his company.
<br>7	The fourth, for the fourth month, was Asa- hel the brother of Joab, and Zabadias his son after him: and in his company were four and twenty thousand.
<br>8	The fifth captain for the fifth month, was Samaoth a Jezerite: and his company were four and twenty thousand.
<br>9	The sixth, for the sixth month, was Hira the son of Acces a Thecuite: and in his company were four and twenty thousand.
<br>10	The seventh, for the seventh month, was Helles a Phallonite of the sons of Ephraim: and in his company were four and twenty thousand.
<br>11	The eighth, for the eighth month, was Sobochai a Husathite of the race of Zarahi: and in his company were four and twenty thousand.
<br>12	The ninth, for the ninth month, was Abiezer an Anathothite of the sons of Jemini, and in his company were four and twenty thou- sand.
<br>13	The tenth, for the tenth month, was Marai, who was a Netophathite of the race of Zarai: and in his company were four and twenty thousand. 14 The eleventh, for the eleventh month, was Banaias, a Pharathonite of the sons of Ephraim: and in his company were four and twenty thou-
<br>sand.
<br>15	The twelfth, for the twelfth month, was Holdai a Netophathite, of the race of Gothoniel: and in his company were four and twenty thou- sand.
<br>16	Now the chiefs over the tribes of Israel were these: over the Rubenites, Eliezer the son of Zechri was ruler: over the Simeonites, Saphatias the son of Maacha:
<br> 
<br>17	Over the Levites, Hasabias the son of Ca- muel: over the Aaronites, Sadoc:
<br>18	Over Juda, Eliu the brother of David over Issachar, Amri the son of Michael:
<br>19	Over the Zabulonites, Jesmaias the son of Adias: over the Nephtalites, Jerimoth the son of Ozriel:
<br>20	Over the sons of Ephraim, Osee the son of Ozaziu: over the half tribe of Manasses, Joel the son of Phadaia:
<br>21	And over the half tribe of Manasses in Galaad, Jaddo the son of Zacharias: and over Benjamin, Jasiel the son of Abner.
<br>22	And over Dan, Ezrihel the son of Jeroham: these were the princes of the children of Israel.
<br>23	But David would not number them from twenty years old and under: because the lord had said that he would multiply Israel like the stars of heaven.
<br>24	Joab the son of Sarvia began to number, but he finished not: because upon this there fell wrath upon Israel: and therefore the number of them that were numbered, was not registered in the chronicles of king David.
<br>25	And over the king’s treasures was Azmoth the son of Adiel: and over those stores which were in the cities, and in the villages, and, in the castles, was Jonathan the son of Ozias.
<br>26	And over the tillage, and the husband- men, who tilled the ground, was Ezri the son of Chelub:
<br>27	And over the dressers of the vine yards, was Semeias a Romathite: and over the wine cellars, Zabdias an Aphonite.
<br>28	And over the oliveyards and the fig groves, which were in the plains, was Balanam a Gederite: and over the oil cellars, Joas.
<br>29	And over the herds that fed in Saron, was Setrai a Saronite: and over the oxen in the val- leys, Saphat the son of Adli:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>30	And over the camels, Ubil an Ishmahelite and over the asses, Jadias a Meronathite:
<br>31	And over the sheep Jaziz an Agarene. All these were the rulers of the substance of king David.
<br>32	And Jonathan David’s uncle, a counsellor, a wise and learned man: he and Jahiel the son of Hachamoni were with the king’s sons.
<br>33	And Achitophel was the king’s counsellor, and Chusai the Arachite, the king’s friend.
<br>34	And after Achitophel was Joiada the son of Banaias, and Abiathar. And the general of the king’s army was Joab.
<br>
<br>Chapter 28
<br>And David assembled all the chief men of Is- rael, the princes of the tribes, and the captains of the companies, who waited on the king: and the captains over thousands, and over hundreds, and them who had the charge over the substance and possessions of the king, and his sons with the officers of the court, and the men of power, and all the bravest of the army at Jerusalem.
<br>2	And the king rising up, and standing said: Hear me, my brethren and my people: I had a thought to have built a house, in which the ark of the Lord, and the footstool of our God might rest: and prepared all things for the building.
<br>3	And God said to me: Thou shalt not build a house to my name: because thou art a man of war, and hast shed blood.
<br>4	But the Lord God of Israel chose me of all the house of my father, to be king over Israel for ever: for of Juda he chose the princes: and of the house of Juda, my father’s house: and among the sons of my father, it pleased him to choose me king over all Israel.
<br>5	And among my sons (for the Lord hath given
<br> 
<br>me many sons) he hath chosen Solomon my son, to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the Lord over Israel.
<br>6	And he said to me: Solomon thy son shall build my house, and my courts: for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be a father to him. 7 And I will establish his kingdom for ever, it he continue to keep my commandments, and my
<br>judgments, as at this day.
<br>8	Now then before all the assembly of Israel, in the hearing of our God, keep ye, and seek all the commandments of the Lord our God: that you may possess the good land, and may leave it to your children after you for ever.
<br>9	And thou my son Solomon, know the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart, and a willing mind: for the Lord searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the thoughts of minds. If thou seek him, thou shalt find him: but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.
<br>10	Now therefore seeing the Lord hath chosen thee to build the house of the sanctuary, take courage, and do it.
<br>11	And David gave to Solomon his son a de- scription of the porch, and of the temple, and of the treasures, and of the upper floor, and of the inner chambers, and of the house for the mercy seat,
<br>12	As also of all the courts, which he had in his thought, and of the chambers round about, for the treasures of the house of the Lord, and for the treasures of the consecrated things,
<br>13	And of the divisions of the priests and of the Levites, for all the works of the house of the Lord, and for all the vessels of the service of the temple of the Lord.
<br>14	Gold by weight for every vessel for the min- istry. And silver by weight according to the di- versity of the vessels and uses.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>15	He gave also gold for the golden candle- sticks, and their lamps, according to the dimen- sions of every candlestick, and the lamps thereof. In like manner also he gave silver by weight for the silver candlesticks, and for their lamps according to the diversity of the dimensions of them.
<br>16	He gave also gold for the tables of proposi- tion, according to the diversity of the tables: in like manner also silver for other tables of silver. 17 For fleshhooks also, and bowls, and censors of fine gold, and for little lions of gold, according to the measure he gave by weight, for every lion.
<br>In like manner also for lions of silver he set aside a different weight of silver.
<br>18	And for the altar of incense, he gave the purest gold: and to make the likeness of the char- iot of the cherubims spreading their wings, and covering the ark of the covenant of the Lord.
<br>19	All these things, said he, came to me writ- ten by the hand of the Lord that I might under- stand all the works of the pattern.
<br>20	And David said to Solomon his son: Act like a man, and take courage, and do: fear not, and be not dismayed: for the Lord my God will be with thee, and will not leave thee, nor forsake thee, till thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of the Lord.
<br>21	Behold the courses of the priests and the Levites, for every ministry of the house of the Lord, stand by thee, and are ready, and both the princes, and the people know how to execute all thy commandments.
<br>
<br>Chapter 29
<br>And king David said to all the assembly: Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, is as yet young and tender: and the work is great,
<br> 
<br>for a house is prepared not for man, but for God. 2 And I with all my ability have prepared the expenses for the house of my God. Gold for ves- sels of gold, and silver for vessels of silver, brass for things of brass, iron for things of iron, wood for things of wood: and onyx stones, and stones like alabaster, and of divers colours, and all man- ner of precious stones, and marble of Paros in
<br>great abundance.
<br>3	Now over and above the things which I have offered into the house of my God I give of my own proper goods, gold and silver for the temple of my God, beside what things I have prepared for the holy house.
<br>4	Three thousand talents of gold of the gold of Ophir: and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the temple.
<br>5	And gold for wheresoever there is need of gold: and silver for wheresoever there is need of silver, for the works to be made by the hands of the artificers: now if any man is willing to offer, let him fill his hand to day, and offer what he pleaseth to the Lord.
<br>6	Then the heads of the families, and the princes of the tribes of Israel and the captains of thousands, and of hundreds, and the overseers of the king’s possessions promised,
<br>7	And they gave for the works of the house of the Lord, of gold, five thousand talents, and ten thousand solids: of silver ten thousand talents: and of brass eighteen thousand talents: and of iron a hundred thousand talents.
<br>8	And all they that had stones, gave them to the treasures of the house of the Lord, by the hand of Jahiel the Gersonite.
<br>9	And the people rejoiced, when they promised their offerings willingly: because they offered them to the Lord with all their heart: and David the king rejoiced also with a great joy.
<br>10	And he blessed the Lord before all the mul-
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>titude, and he said: Blessed art thou, O Lord the God of Israel, our father from eternity to eter- nity.
<br>11	Thine, O Lord, is magnificence, and power, and glory, and victory: and to thee is praise: for all that is in heaven, and in earth, is thine: thine is the kingdom, O Lord, and thou art above all princes.
<br>12	Thine are riches, and thine is glory, thou hast dominion over all, in thy hand is power and might: in thy hand greatness, and the empire of all things.
<br>13	Now therefore our God we give thanks to thee, and we praise thy glorious name.
<br>14	Who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to promise thee all these things? all things are thine: and we have given thee what we received of thy hand.
<br>15	For we are sojourners before thee, and strangers, as were all our fathers. I Our days upon earth are as a shadow, and there is no stay. 16 O Lord our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee a house for thy holy name,
<br>is from thy hand, and all things are thine.
<br>17 I know my God that thou provest hearts, and lovest simplicity, wherefore I also in the sim- plicity of my heart, have joyfully offered all these things: and I have seen with great joy thy people, which are here present, offer thee their offerings. 18 O Lord God of Abraham, and   of   Isaac, and of Israel our fathers, keep for ever this will of their heart, and let this mind remain always
<br>for the worship of thee.
<br>19	And give to Solomon my son a perfect heart, that he may keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy ceremonies, and do all things: and build the house, for which I have provided the charges.
<br>20	And David commanded all the assembly: Bless ye the Lord our God. And all the assembly
<br> 
<br>blessed the Lord the God of their fathers: and they bowed themselves and worshipped God, and then the king.
<br>21	And they sacrificed victims to the Lord: and they offered holocausts the next day, a thou- sand bullocks, a thousand rams, a thousand lambs, with their libations, and with every thing prescribed most abundantly for all Israel.
<br>22	And they ate, and drank before the Lord that day with great joy. And they anointed the second time Solomon the son of David. And they anointed him to the Lord to be prince, and Sadoc to be high priest.
<br>23	And Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord as king instead of David his father, and he pleased all: and all Israel obeyed him.
<br>24	And all the princes, and men of power, and all the sons of king David gave their hand, and were subject to Solomon the king.
<br>25	And the Lord magnified Solomon over all Israel: and gave him the glory of a reign, such as no king of Israel had before him.
<br>26	So David the son of Isai reigned over all Israel.
<br>27	And the days that he reigned over Israel, were forty years: in Hebron he reigned seven years, and in Jerusalem three and thirty years.
<br>28	And he died in a good age, full of days, and riches, and glory. And Solomon his son reigned in his stead.
<br>29	Now the acts of king David first and last are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer:
<br>30	And of all his reign, and his valour, and of the times that passed under him, either in Israel, or in all the kingdoms of the countries.

<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>
<br>And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the Lord his God was with him, and magnified him to a high degree.
<br>2	And Solomon gave orders to all Israel, to the captains of thousands, and of hundreds, and to the rulers, and to the judges of all Israel, and the heads of the families:
<br>3	And he went with all the multitude to the high place of Gabaon, where was the tabernacle of the covenant of the Lord, which Moses the servant of God made, in the wilderness.
<br>4	For David had brought the ark of God from Cariathiarim to the place, which he had prepared for it, and where he had pitched a tabernacle for it, that is, in Jerusalem.
<br>5	And the altar of brass, which Beseleel the son of Uri the son of Hur had made, was there before the tabernacle of the Lord: and Solomon and all the assembly sought it:
<br>6	And Solomon went up thither to the brazen altar, before the tabernacle of the covenant of the Lord, and offered up on it a thousand victims.
<br>7	And behold that night God appeared to him, saying: Ask what thou wilt that I should give thee.
<br>8	And Solomon said to God: Thou hast shewn great kindness to my father David: and hast made me king in his stead.
<br>9	Now therefore, O Lord God, let thy word
<br> 
<br>be fulfilled, which thou hast promised to David my father: for thou hast made me king over thy great people, which is as innumerable as the dust of the earth.
<br>10	Give me wisdom and knowledge that I may come in and go out before thy people: for who can worthily judge this thy people, which is so great?
<br>11	And God said to Solomon: Because this choice hath pleased thy heart, and thou hast not asked riches, and wealth, and glory, nor the lives of them that hate thee, nor many days of life: but hast asked wisdom and knowledge, to be able to judge my people, over which I have made thee king,
<br>12	Wisdom and knowledge are granted to thee: and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and glory, so that none of the kings before thee, nor after thee, shall be like thee.
<br>13	Then Solomon came from the high place of Gabaon to Jerusalem before the tabernacle of the covenant, and reigned over Israel.
<br>14	And he gathered to himself chariots and horsemen, and he had a thousand four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen: and he placed them in the cities of the chariots, and with the king in Jerusalem.
<br>15	And the king made silver and gold to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar trees as sycamores, which grow in the plains in great mul- titude.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>16	And there were horses brought him from Egypt, and from Coa by the king’s merchants, who went, and bought at a price,
<br>17	A chariot of four horses for six hundred pieces of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty: in like manner market was made in all the kingdoms of the Hethites, and of the kings of Syria.
<br>
<br>Chapter 2
<br>And Solomon determined to build a house to the name of the Lord, and a palace for himself.
<br>2	And he numbered out seventy thousand men to bear burdens, and eighty thousand to hew stones in the mountains, and three thousand six hundred to oversee them.
<br>3	He sent also to Hiram king of Tyre, saying: As thou didst with David my father, and didst send him cedars, to build him a house, in which he dwelt:
<br>4	So do with me that I may build a house to the name of the Lord my God, to dedicate it to burn incense before him, and to perfume with aromatical spices, and for the continual setting forth of bread, and for the holocausts, morning and evening, and on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and the solemnities of the Lord our God for ever, which are commanded for Israel.
<br>5	For the house which I desire to build, is great: for our God is great above all gods.
<br>6	Who then can be able to build him a worthy house? if heaven, and the heavens of heavens cannot contain him: who am I that I should be able to build him a house? but to this end only, that incense may be burnt before him.
<br>7	Send me therefore a skilful man, that knoweth how to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, and in iron, in purple, in scarlet and in
<br> 
<br>blue, and that hath skill in engraving, with the artificers, which I have with me in Judea and Jerusalem, whom David my father provided.
<br>8	Send me also cedars, and fir trees, and pine trees from Libanus: for I know that thy servants are skilful in cutting timber in Libanus, and my servants shall be with thy servants,
<br>9	To provide me timber in abundance. For the house which I desire to build, is to be exceeding great, and glorious.
<br>10	And I will give thy servants the workmen that are to cut down the trees, for their food twenty thousand cores of wheat, and as many cores of barley, and twenty thousand measures of wine, and twenty thousand measures of oil.
<br>11	And Hiram king of Tyre sent a letter to Solomon, saying: Because the Lord hath loved his people, therefore he hath made thee king over them.
<br>12	And he added, saying: Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel, who made heaven and earth, who hath given to king David a wise and know- ing son, endued with understanding and pru- dence, to build a house to the Lord, and a palace for himself.
<br>13	I therefore have sent thee my father Hiram, a wise and most skilful man,
<br>14	The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, whose father was a Tyrian, who knoweth how to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, and in iron, and in marble, and in timber, in pur- ple also, and violet, and silk and scarlet: and who knoweth to grave all sort of graving, and to devise ingeniously all that there may be need of in the work with thy artificers, and with the artificers of my lord David thy father.
<br>15	The wheat therefore, and the barley and the oil, and the wine, which thou, my lord, hast promised, send to thy servants.
<br>16	And we will cut down as many trees out
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>of Libanus, as thou shalt want, and will convey them in floats by sea to Joppe: and it will be thy part to bring them thence to Jerusalem.
<br>17	And Solomon numbered all the proselytes in the land of Israel, after the numbering which David his father had made, and they were found a hundred and fifty-three thousand and six hun- dred.
<br>18	And he set seventy thousand of them to carry burdens on their shoulders, and eighty thousand to hew stones in the mountains: and three thousand and six hundred to be overseers of the work of the people.
<br>
<br>Chapter 3
<br>And Solomon began to build the house of the Lord in Jerusalem, in mount Moria, which had been shewn to David his father, in the place which David had prepared in the thrashingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.
<br>2	And he began to build in the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.
<br>3	Now these are the foundations, which Solomon laid, to build the house of God, the length by the first measure sixty cubits, the breadth twenty cubits.
<br>4	And the porch in the front, which was ex- tended in length according to the measure of the breadth of the house, twenty cubits: and the height was a hundred and twenty cubits: and he overlaid it within with pure gold.
<br>5	And the greater house he ceiled with deal boards, and overlaid them with plates of fine gold throughout: and he graved in them palm trees, and like little chains interlaced with one another. 6 He paved also the floor of the temple with
<br>most precious marble, of great beauty.
<br>7 And the gold of the plates with which he
<br> 
<br>overlaid the house, and the beams thereof, and the posts, and the walls, and the doors was of the finest: and he graved cherubims on the walls.
<br>8	He made also the house of the holy of holies: the length of it according to the breadth of the temple, twenty cubits, and the breadth of it in like manner twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with plates of gold, amounting to about six hun- dred talents.
<br>9	He made also nails of gold, and the weight of every nail was fifty sicles: the upper chambers also he overlaid with gold.
<br>10	He made also in the house of the holy of holies two cherubims of image work: and he over- laid them with gold.
<br>11	The wings of the cherubims were extended twenty cubits, so that one wing was five cubits long, and reached to the wall of the house: and the other was also five cubits long, and reached to the wing of the other cherub.
<br>12	In like manner the wing of the other cherub, was five cubits long, and reached to the wall: and his other wing was five cubits long, and touched the wing of the other cherub.
<br>13	So the wings of the two cherubims were spread forth, and were extended twenty cubits: and they stood upright on their feet, and their faces were turned toward the house without.
<br>14	He made also a veil of violet, purple, scar- let, and silk: and wrought in it cherubims.
<br>15	He made also before the doors of the tem- ple two pillars, which were five and thirty cubits high: and their chapiters were five cubits.
<br>16	He made also as it were little chains in the oracle, and he put them on the heads of the pillars: and a hundred pomegranates, which he put between the little chains.
<br>17	These pillars he put at the entrance of the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left: that which was on the right hand, he
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>called Jachin: and that on the left hand, Booz.
<br>
<br>Chapter 4
<br>He made also an altar of brass twenty cubits long, and twenty cubits broad, and ten cubits high.
<br>2	Also a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass: it was five cubits high, and a line of thirty cubits compassed it round about.
<br>3	And under it there was the likeness of oxen, and certain engravings on the outside of ten cu- bits compassed the belly of the sea, as it were with two rows.
<br>4	And the oxen were cast: and the sea itself was set upon the twelve oxen, three of which looked toward the north, and other three toward the west: and other three toward the south, and the other three that remained toward the east, and the sea stood upon them: and the hinder parts of the oxen were inward under the sea.
<br>5	Now the thickness of it was a handbreadth, and the brim of it was like the brim of a cup, or of a crisped lily: and it held three thousand measures.
<br>6	He made also ten lavers: and he set five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them all such things as they were to offer for holocausts: but the sea was for the priests to wash in.
<br>7	And he made ten golden candlesticks, ac- cording to the form which they were commanded to be made by: and he set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.
<br>8	Moreover also ten tables: and he set them in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. Also a hundred bowls of gold.
<br>9	He made also the court of the priests, and a
<br> 
<br>great hall, and doors in the hall, which he cov- ered with brass.
<br>10	And he set the sea on the right side over against the east toward the south.
<br>11	And Hiram made caldrons, and fleshhooks, and bowls: and finished all the king’s work the house of God:
<br>12	That is to say, the two pillars, and the pommels, and the chapiters, and the network, to cover the chapiters over the pommels.
<br>13	And four hundred pomegranates, and two wreaths of network, so that two rows of pomegranates were joined to each wreath, to cover the pommels, and the chapiters of the pil- lars.
<br>14	He made also bases, and lavers, which he set upon the bases:
<br>15	One sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;
<br>16	And the caldrons, and fleshhooks, and bowls. All the vessels did Hiram his father make for Solomon in the house of the Lord of the finest brass.
<br>17	In the country near the Jordan did the king cast them, in a clay ground between Sochot and Saredatha.
<br>18	And the multitude of vessels was innumer- able, so that the weight of the brass was not known.
<br>19	And Solomon made all the vessels for the house of God, and the golden altar, and the ta- bles, upon which were the loaves of proposition,
<br>20	The candlesticks also of most pure gold with their lamps to give light before the oracle, according to the manner.
<br>21	And certain flowers, and lamps, and golden tongs: all were made of the finest gold.
<br>22	The vessels also for the perfumes, and the censers, and the bowls, and the mortars, of pure gold. And he graved the doors of the inner tem- ple, that is, for the holy of holies: and the doors
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>of the temple without were of gold. And thus all the work was finished which Solomon made in the house of the Lord.
<br>
<br>Chapter 5
<br>Then Solomon brought in all those things that David his father had vowed, the silver, and the gold, and all the vessels he put among the trea- sures of the house of God.
<br>2	And after this he gathered together the an- cients of Israel and all the princes of the tribes, and the heads of the families, of the children of Israel to Jerusalem, to bring the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the city of David, which is Sion.
<br>3	And all the men of Israel came to the king in the solemn day of the seventh month.
<br>4	And when all the ancients of Israel were come, the Levites took up the ark,
<br>5	And brought it in, together with all the fur- niture of the tabernacle.   And the priests with the Levites carried the vessels of the sanctuary, which were in the tabernacle.
<br>6	And king Solomon and all the assembly of Israel and all that were gathered together before the ark, sacrificed rams, and oxen without num- ber: so great was the multitude of the victims.
<br>7	And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the Lord into its place, that is, to the oracle of the temple, into the holy of holies under the wings of the cherubims:
<br>8	So that the cherubims spread their wings over the place, in which the ark was set, and covered the ark itself and its staves.
<br>9	Now the ends of the staves wherewith the ark was carried, because they were some thing longer, were seen before the oracle: but if a man were a little outward, he could not see them. So
<br> 
<br>the ark has been there unto this day.
<br>10	And there was nothing else in the ark but the two tables which Moses put there at Horeb when the Lord gave the law to the children of Israel, at their coming out of Egypt.
<br>11	Now when the priests were come out of the sanctuary, for all the priests that could be found there, were sanctified: and as yet at that time the courses and orders of the ministries were not divided among them,
<br>12	Both the Levites and the singing men, that is, both they that were under Asaph, and they that were under Heman, and they that were un- der Idithun, with their sons, and their brethren, clothed with fine linen, sounded with cymbals, and psalteries, and harps, standing on the east side of the altar, and with them a hundred and twenty priests, sounding with trumpets.
<br>13	So when they all sounded together, both with trumpets, and voice, and cymbals, and or- gans, and with divers kind of musical instru- ments, and lifted up their voice on high: the sound was heard afar off, so that when they be- gan to praise the Lord, and to say: Give glory to the Lord for he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever: the house of God was filled with a cloud. 14 Nor could the priests stand and minister by reason of the cloud. For the glory of the Lord
<br>had filled the house of God.
<br>
<br>Chapter 6
<br>Then Solomon said: The Lord promised that he would dwell in a cloud.
<br>2	But I have built a house to his name, that he might dwell there for ever.
<br>3	And the king turned his face, and blessed all the multitude of Israel for all the multitude stood attentive and he said:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>4	Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel, who hath accomplished in deed that which he spoke to David my father, saying:
<br>5	From the day that I brought my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel, for a house to be built in it to my name: neither chose I any other man, to be the ruler of my people Israel.
<br>6	But I chose Jerusalem, that my name might be there: and I chose David to set him over my people Israel.
<br>7	And whereas David my father had a mind to build a house to the name of the Lord the God of Israel,
<br>8	The Lord said to him: Forasmuch as it was thy will to build a house to my name, thou hast done well indeed in having such a will:
<br>9	But thou shalt not build the house, but thy son, who shall come out of thy loins, he shall build a house to my name.
<br>10	The Lord therefore hath accomplished his word which he spoke: and I am risen up in the place of David my father, and sit upon the throne of Israel, as the Lord promised: and have built a house to the name of the Lord God of Israel.
<br>11	And I have put in it the ark, wherein is the covenant of the Lord, which he made with the children of Israel.
<br>12	And he stood before the altar of the Lord, in presence of all the multitude of Israel, and stretched forth his hands.
<br>13	For Solomon had made a brazen scaffold, and had set it in the midst of the temple, which was five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high: and he stood upon it: then kneeling down in the presence of all the multi- tude of Israel, and lifting up his hands towards heaven,
<br>14	He said: O Lord God of Israel, there is no God like thee in heaven nor in earth: who
<br> 
<br>keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants, that walk before thee with all their hearts:
<br>15	Who hast performed to thy servant David my father all that thou hast promised him: and hast accomplished in fact, what thou hast spoken with thy mouth, as also the present time proveth. 16 Now then, O Lord God of Israel, fulfil to thy servant David my father,  whatsoever thou hast promised him, saying: There shall not fail thee a man in my sight, to sit upon the throne of Israel: yet so that thy children take heed to their ways, and walk in my law, as thou hast walked
<br>before me.
<br>17	And now, Lord God of Israel, let thy word be established which thou hast spoken to thy servant David.
<br>18	Is it credible then that God should dwell with men on the earth? If heaven and the heav- ens of heavens do not contain thee, how much less this house, which I have built?
<br>19	But to this end only it is made, that thou mayest regard the prayer of thy servant and his supplication, O Lord my God: and mayest hear the prayers which thy servant poureth out before thee.
<br>20	That thou mayest open thy eyes upon this house day and night, upon the place wherein thou hast promised that thy name should be called upon,
<br>21	And that thou wouldst hear the prayer which thy servant prayeth in it: hearken then to the prayers of thy servant, and of thy peo- ple Israel. Whosoever shall pray in its place, hear thou from thy dwelling place, that is, from heaven, and shew mercy.
<br>22	If any man sin against his neighbour, and come to swear against him, and bind himself with a curse before the altar in this house:
<br>23	Then hear thou from heaven, and do justice to thy servants, so to requite the wicked by mak-
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>ing his wickedness fall upon his own head, and to revenge the just, rewarding him according to his justice.
<br>24	If thy people Israel be overcome by their enemies, (for they will sin against thee,) and be- ing converted shall do penance, and call upon thy name, and pray to thee in this place,
<br>25	Then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel and bring them back into the land which thou gavest to them, and their fathers.
<br>26	If the heavens be shut up, and there fall no rain by reason of the sin of the people, and they shall pray to thee in this place, and confess to thy name, and be converted from their sins, where thou dost afflict them,
<br>27	Then hear thou from heaven, O Lord, and forgive the sins of thy servants and of thy people Israel and teach them the good way in which they may walk: and give rain to thy land which thou hast given to thy people to possess.
<br>28	If a famine arise in the land, or a pestilence or blasting, or mildew, or locusts, or caterpillars: or if their enemies waste the country, and besiege the cities, whatsoever scourge or infirmity shall be upon them:
<br>29	Then if any of thy people Israel, knowing his own scourge and infirmity shall pray, and shall spread forth his hands in this house,
<br>30	Hear thou from heaven, from thy high dwelling place, and forgive, and render to every one according to his ways, which thou knowest him to have in his heart: for thou only knowest the hearts of the children of men:
<br>31	That they may fear thee, and walk in thy ways all the days that they live upon the face of the land, which thou hast given to our fathers.
<br>32	If the stranger also, who is not of thy people Israel, come from a far country, for the sake of thy great name, and thy strong hand, and thy
<br> 
<br>stretched out arm, and adore in this place:
<br>33	Hear thou from heaven thy firm dwelling place, and do all that which that stranger shall call upon thee for: that all the people of the earth may know thy name, and may fear thee, as thy people Israel, and may know, that thy name is invoked upon this house, which I have built.
<br>34	If thy people go out to war against their en- emies, by the way that thou shalt send them, and adore thee towards the way of this city, which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built to thy name:
<br>35	Then hear thou from heaven their prayers, and their supplications, and revenge them.
<br>36	And if they sin against thee (for there is no man that sinneth not) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them up to their enemies, and they lead them away captive to a land either afar off, or near at hand,
<br>37	And if they be converted in their heart in the land to which they were led captive, and do penance, and pray to thee in the land of their captivity saying: We have sinned, we have done wickedly, we have dealt unjustly:
<br>38	And return to thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their cap- tivity, to which they were led away, and adore thee towards the way of their own land which thou gavest their fathers, and of the city, which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built to thy name:
<br>39	Then hear thou from heaven, that is, from thy firm dwelling place, their prayers, and do judgment, and forgive thy people, although they have sinned:
<br>40	For thou art my God: let thy eyes, I be- seech thee, be open, and let thy ears be attentive to the prayer, that is made in this place.
<br>41	Now therefore arise, O Lord God, into thy resting place, thou and the ark of thy strength:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>let thy priests, O Lord God, put on salvation, and thy saints rejoice in good things.
<br>42	O Lord God, turn not away the face of thy anointed: remember the mercies of David thy servant.
<br>
<br>Chapter 7
<br>And when Solomon had made an end of his prayer, fire came down from heaven, and con- sumed the holocausts and the victims: and the majesty of the Lord filled the house.
<br>2	Neither could the priests enter into the tem- ple of the Lord, because the majesty of the Lord had filled the temple of the Lord.
<br>3	Moreover all the children of Israel saw the fire coming down, and the glory of the Lord upon the house: and falling down with their faces to the ground, upon the stone pavement, they adored and praised the Lord: because he is good, because his mercy endureth for ever.
<br>4	And the king and all the people sacrificed victims before the Lord.
<br>5	And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand oxen, and one hundred and twenty thousand rams: and the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.
<br>6	And the priests stood in their offices: and the Levites with the instruments of music of the Lord, which king David made to praise the Lord: because his mercy endureth for ever, singing the hymns of David by their ministry: and the priests sounded with trumpets before them, and all Israel stood.
<br>7	Solomon also sanctified the middle of the court before the temple of the Lord: for he of- fered there the holocausts, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the brazen altar, which he had made, could not hold the holocausts and
<br> 
<br>the sacrifices and the fat:
<br>8	And Solomon kept the solemnity at that time seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entrance of Emath to the torrent of Egypt.
<br>9	And he made on the eighth day a solemn as- sembly, because he had kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and had celebrated the solem- nity seven days.
<br>10	So on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent away the people to their dwellings, joyful and glad for the good that the Lord had done to David, and to Solomon, and to all Israel his people.
<br>11	And Solomon finished the house of the Lord, and the king’s house, and all that he had designed in his heart to do, in the house of the Lord, and in his own house, and he prospered.
<br>12	And the Lord appeared to him by night, and said: I have heard thy prayer, and I have chosen this place to myself for a house of sacri- fice.
<br>13	If I shut up heaven, and there fall no rain, or if I give orders, and command the locust to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people:
<br>14	And my people, upon whom my name is called, being converted, shall make supplication to me, and seek out my face, and do penance for their most wicked ways: then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sins and will heal their land.
<br>15	My eyes also shall be open, and my ears attentive to the prayer of him that shall pray in this place.
<br>16	For I have chosen, and have sanctified this place, that my name may be there for ever, and my eyes and my heart may remain there perpet- ually.
<br>17	And as for thee,  if thou walk before me,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>as David thy father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and keep my justices and my judgments:
<br>18	I will raise up the throne of thy kingdom, as I promised to David thy father, saying: There shall not fail thee a man of thy stock to be ruler in Israel.
<br>19	But if you turn away, and forsake my jus- tices, and my commandments which I have set before you, and shall go and serve strange gods, and adore them,
<br>20	I will pluck you up by the root out of my land which I have given you: and this house which I have sanctified to my name, I will cast away from before my face, and will make it a byword, and an example among all nations.
<br>21	And this house shall be for a proverb to all that pass by, and they shall be astonished and say: Why hath the Lord done thus to this land, and to this house?
<br>22	And they shall answer: Because they for- sook the Lord the God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on strange gods, and adored them, and wor- shipped them: therefore all these evils are come upon them.
<br>
<br>Chapter 8
<br>And at the end of twenty years after Solomon had built the house of the Lord and his own house:
<br>2	He built the cities which Hiram had given to Solomon, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there.
<br>3	He went also into Emath Suba, and pos- sessed it.
<br>4	And he built Palmira in the desert, and he built other strong cities in Emath.
<br> 
<br>5	And he built Beth-horon the upper, and Beth-horon the nether, walled cities with gates and bars and locks.
<br>6	Balaath also and all the strong cities that were Solomon’s, and all the cities of the char- iots, and the cities of the horsemen. All that Solomon had a mind, and designed, he built in Jerusalem and in Libanus, and in all the land of his dominion.
<br>7	All the people that were left of the Hethites, and the Amorrhites, and the Pherezites, and the Hevites, and the Jebusites, that were not of the stock of Israel:
<br>8	Of their children, and of the posterity, whom the children of Israel had not slain, Solomon made to be the tributaries, unto this day.
<br>9	But of the children of Israel he set none to serve in the king’s works: for they were men of war, and chief captains, and rulers of his chariots and horsemen.
<br>10	And all the chief captains of king Solomon’s army were two hundred and fifty, who taught the people.
<br>11	And he removed the daughter of Pharao from the city of David, to the house which he had built for her.   For the king said: My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, for it is sanctified: because the ark of the Lord came into it.
<br>12	Then Solomon offered holocausts to the Lord upon the altar of the Lord which he had built before the porch,
<br>13	That every day an offering might be made on it according to the ordinance of Moses, in the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the festival days three times a year, that is to say, in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles.
<br>14	And he appointed according to the order of David his father the offices of the priests in their
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>ministries: and the Levites in their order to give praise, and minister before the priests according to the duty of every day: and the porters in their divisions by gate and gate: for so David the man of God had commanded.
<br>15	And the priests and Levites departed not from the king’s commandments, as to any thing that he had commanded, and as to the keeping of the treasures.
<br>16	Solomon had all charges prepared, from the day that he founded the house of the Lord, until the day wherein he finished it.
<br>17	Then Solomon went to Asiongaber, and to Ailath, on the coast of the Red Sea, which is in the land of Edom.
<br>18	And Hiram sent him ships by the hands of his servants, and skilful mariners, and they went with Solomon’s servants to Ophir, and they took thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought it to king Solomon.
<br>
<br>Chapter 9
<br>And when the queen of Saba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to try him with hard ques- tions at Jerusalem, with great riches, and camels, which carried spices, and abundance of gold, and precious stones. And when she was come to Solomon, she proposed to him all that was in her heart.
<br>2	And Solomon explained to her all that she proposed: and there was not any thing that he did not make clear unto her.
<br>3	And when she had seen these things, to wit, the wisdom of Solomon, and the house which he had built,
<br>4	And the meats of his table, and the dwelling places of his servants, and the attendance of his officers, and their apparel, his cupbearers also,
<br> 
<br>and their garments, and the victims which he offered in the house of the Lord: there was no more spirit in her, she was so astonished.
<br>5	And she said to the king: The word is true which I heard in my country of thy virtues and wisdom.
<br>6	I did not believe them that told it, until I came, and my eyes had seen, and I had proved that scarce one half of thy wisdom had been told me: thou hast exceeded the same with thy virtues.
<br>7	Happy are thy men, and happy are thy ser- vants, who stand always before thee, and hear thy wisdom.
<br>8	Blessed be the Lord thy God, who hath been pleased to set thee on his throne, king of the Lord thy God. Because God loveth Israel, and will preserve them forever: therefore hath he made thee king over them, to do judgment and justice. 9 And she gave to the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and spices in great abun- dance, and most precious stones: there were no such spices as these which the queen of Saba gave
<br>to king Solomon.
<br>10	And the servants also of Hiram, with the servants of Solomon, brought gold from Ophir, and thyine trees, and most precious stones:
<br>11	And the king made of the thyine trees stairs in the house of the Lord, and in the king’s house, and harps and psalteries for the singing men: never were there seen such trees in the land of Juda.
<br>12	And king Solomon gave to the queen of Saba all that she desired, and that she asked, and many more things than she brought to him: so she returned, and went to her own country with her servants.
<br>13	And the weight of the gold, that was brought to Solomon every year, was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>14	Beside the sum which the deputies of divers nations, and the merchants were accustomed to bring, and all the kings of Arabia, and the lords of the lands, who brought gold and silver to Solomon.
<br>15	And king Solomon made two hundred golden spears, of the sum of six hundred pieces of gold, which went to every spear:
<br>16	And three hundred golden shields of three hundred pieces of gold, which went to the cover- ing of every shield: and the king put them in the armoury, which was compassed with a wood.
<br>17	The king also made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold.
<br>18	And six steps to go up to the throne, and a footstool of gold, and two arms one on either side, and two lions standing by the arms:
<br>19	Moreover twelve other little lions standing upon the steps on both sides: there was not such a throne in any kingdom.
<br>20	And all the vessels of the king’s table were of gold, and the vessels of the house of the for- est of Libanus were of the purest gold. For no account was made of silver in those days.
<br>21	For the king’s ships went to Tharsis with the servants of Hiram, once in three years: and they brought thence gold and silver, and ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
<br>22	And Solomon was magnified above all the kings of the earth for riches and glory.
<br>23	And all the kings of the earth desired to see the face of Solomon, that they might hear the wisdom which God had given in his heart.
<br>24	And every year they brought him presents, vessels of silver and of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, and horses, and mules.
<br>25	And Solomon had forty thousand horses in the stables, and twelve thousand chariots, and horsemen, and he placed them in the cities of the chariots and where the king was in Jerusalem.
<br> 
<br>26	And he exercised authority over all the kings from the river Euphrates to the land of the Philistines, and to the borders of Egypt.
<br>27	And he made silver as plentiful in Jerusalem as stones: and cedars as common as the sycamores, which grow in the plains.
<br>28	And horses were brought to him out of Egypt, and out of all countries.
<br>29	Now the rest of the acts of Solomon first and last are written in the words of Nathan the prophet, and in the books of Ahias the Silonite, and in the vision of Addo the seer, against Jer- oboam the son of Nabat.
<br>30	And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.
<br>31	And he slept with his fathers: and they buried him in the city of David: and Roboam his son reigned in his stead.
<br>
<br>Chapter 10
<br>And Roboam went to Sichem: for thither all Is- rael were assembled, to make him king.
<br>2	And when Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who was in Egypt, (for he was fled thither from Solomon,) heard it, forthwith he returned.
<br>3	And they sent for him, and he came with all Israel, and they spoke to Roboam, saying:
<br>4	Thy father oppressed with a most grievous yoke, do thou govern us with a lighter hand than thy father, who laid upon us a heavy servitude, and ease some thing of the burden, that we may serve thee.
<br>5	And he said to them: Come to me again af- ter three days. And when the people were gone, 6 He took counsel with the ancients, who had stood before his father Solomon, while he yet lived, saying: What counsel give you to me, that
<br>I may answer the people?
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>7	And they said to him: If thou please this people, and soothe them with kind words, they will be thy servants for ever.
<br>8	But he forsook the counsel of the ancients, and began to treat with the young men, that had been brought up with him, and were in his train. 9 And he said to them: What seemeth good to you? or what shall I answer this people, who have said to me: Ease the yoke which thy father
<br>laid upon us?
<br>10	But they answered as young men, and brought up with him in pleasures, and said: Thus shalt thou speak to the people, that said to thee: Thy father made our yoke heavy, do thou ease it: thus shalt thou answer them: My little finger is thicker than the loins of my father.
<br>11	My father laid upon you a heavy yoke, and I will add more weight to it: my father beat you with scourges, but I will beat you with scorpions. 12 So Jeroboam, and all the people came to Roboam the third day, as he commanded them. 13 And the king answered roughly, leaving the
<br>counsel of the ancients.
<br>14	And he spoke according to the advice of the young men: My father laid upon you a heavy yoke, which I will make heavier: my father beat you with scourges, but I will beat you with scor- pions.
<br>15	And he condescended not to the people’s requests: for it was the will of God, that his word might be fulfilled which he had spoken by the hand of Ahias the Silonite to Jeroboam the son of Nabat.
<br>16	And all the people upon the king’s speaking roughly, said thus unto him: We have no part in David, nor inheritance in the son of Isai. Return to thy dwellings, O Israel, and do thou, O David feed thy own house. And Israel went away to their dwellings.
<br>17	But Roboam reigned over the children of
<br> 
<br>Israel that dwelt in the cities of Juda.
<br>18	And king Roboam sent Aduram, who was over the tributes, and the children of Israel stoned him, and he died: and king Roboam made haste to get up into his chariot, and fled into Jerusalem.
<br>19	And Israel revolted from the house of David unto this day.
<br>
<br>Chapter 11
<br>And Roboam came to Jerusalem, and called to- gether all the house of Juda and of Benjamin, a hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men and warriors, to fight against Israel, and to bring back his kingdom to him.
<br>2	And the word of the Lord came to Semeias the man of God, saying:
<br>3	Speak to Roboam the son of Solomon the king of Juda, and to all Israel, in Juda and Ben- jamin:
<br>4	Thus saith the Lord: You shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren: let every man return to his own house, for by my will this thing has been done. And when they heard the word of the Lord, they returned, and did not go against Jeroboam,
<br>5	And Roboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built walled cities in Juda.
<br>6	And he built Bethlehem, and Etam, and Thecue,
<br>7	And Bethsur, and Socho, and Odollam,
<br>8	And Geth, and Maresa, and Ziph,
<br>9	And Aduram, and Lachis, and Azecha,
<br>10	Saraa also, and Aialon, and Hebron, which are in Juda and Benjamin, well fenced cities.
<br>11	And when he had enclosed them with walls, he put in them governors and storehouses of pro- visions, that is, of oil and of wine.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>12	Moreover in every city he made an armoury of shields and spears, and he fortified them with great diligence, and he reigned over Juda, and Benjamin,
<br>13	And the priests and Levites, that were in all Israel, came to him out of all their seats,
<br>14	Leaving their suburbs, and their posses- sions, and passing over to Juda, and Jerusalem, because Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off, from executing the priestly office to the Lord.
<br>15	And he made to himself priests for the high places, and for the devils, and for the calves which he had made.
<br>16	Moreover out of all the tribes of Israel, whosoever gave their heart to seek the Lord the God of Israel, came into Jerusalem to sacrifice their victims before the Lord the God of their fathers.
<br>17	And they strengthened the kingdom of Juda, and established Roboam the son of Solomon for three years: for they walked in the ways of David and of Solomon, only three years. 18 And Roboam took to wife Mahalath, the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David: and Abi-
<br>hail the daughter of Eliab the son of Isai.
<br>19	And they bore him sons Jehus, and Somo- rias, and Zoom.
<br>20	And after her he married Maacha the daughter of Absalom, who bore him Abia, and Ethai, and Ziza, and Salomith.
<br>21	And Roboam loved Maacha the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and concubines: for he had married eighteen wives, and threescore concubines: and he begot eight and twenty sons, and threescore daughters.
<br>22	But he put at the head of them Abia the son of Maacha to be the chief ruler over all his brethren: for he meant to make him king,
<br>23	Because he was wiser and mightier than all his sons, and in all the countries of Juda, and
<br> 
<br>of Benjamin, and in all the walled cities: and he gave them provisions in abundance, and he sought many wives.
<br>
<br>Chapter 12
<br>And when the kingdom of Roboam was strength- ened and fortified, he forsook the law of the Lord, and all Israel with him.
<br>2	And in the fifth year of the reign of Roboam, Sesac king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem (because they had sinned against the Lord)
<br>3	With twelve hundred chariots and threescore thousand horsemen: and the people were with- out number that came with him out of Egypt, to wit, Libyans, and Troglodites, and Ethiopians.
<br>4	And he took the strongest cities in Juda, and came to Jerusalem.
<br>5	And Semeias the prophet came to Roboam, and to the princes of Juda, that were gathered together in Jerusalem, fleeing from Sesac, and he said to them: Thus saith the Lord: You have left me, and I have left you in the hand of Sesac.
<br>6	And the princes of Israel, and the king, being in a consternation, said: The Lord is just.
<br>7	And when the Lord saw that they were hum- bled, the word of the Lord came to Semeias, say- ing: Because they are humbled, I will not destroy them, and I will give them a little help, and my wrath shall not fall upon Jerusalem by the hand of Sesac.
<br>8	But yet they shall serve him, that they may know the difference between my service, and the service of a kingdom of the earth.
<br>9	So Sesac king of Egypt departed from Jerusalem, taking away the treasures of the king’s house, and he took all with him, and the golden shields that Solomon had made,
<br>10	Instead of which the king made brazen
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>ones, and delivered them to the captains of the shieldbearers, who guarded the entrance of the palace.
<br>11	And when the king entered into the house of the Lord, the shieldbearers came and took them, and brought them back again to their ar- moury.
<br>12	But yet because they were humbled, the wrath of the Lord turned away from them, and they were not utterly destroyed: for even in Juda there were found good works.
<br>13	King Roboam therefore was strengthened in Jerusalem, and reigned: he was one and forty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the Lord chose out of all the tribes of Israel, to estab- lish his name there: and the name of his mother was Naama an Ammonitess.
<br>14	But he did evil, and did not prepare his heart to seek the Lord.
<br>15	Now the acts of Roboam first and last are written in the books of Semeias the prophet, and of Addo the seer, and diligently recorded: and there was war between Roboam and Jeroboam all their days.
<br>16	And Roboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David. And Abia his son reigned in his stead.
<br>
<br>Chapter 13
<br>In the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam, Abia reigned over Juda.
<br>2	Three years he reigned in Jerusalem, and his mother’s name was Michaia, the daughter of Uriel of Gabaa: and there was war between Abia and Jeroboam.
<br>3	And when Abia had begun battle, and had with him four hundred thousand most valiant
<br> 
<br>and chosen men, Jeroboam put his army in array against him, eight hundred thousand men, who were also chosen and most valiant for war.
<br>4	And Abia stood upon mount Semeron, which was in Ephraim, and said: Hear me, O Jeroboam, and all Israel:
<br>5	Do you not know that the Lord God of Israel gave to David the kingdom over Israel for ever, to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?
<br>6	And Jeroboam the son of Nabat, the ser- vant of Solomon the son of David, rose up: and rebelled against his lord.
<br>7	And there were gathered to him vain men, and children of Belial: and they prevailed against Roboam the son of Solomon: for Roboam was unexperienced, and of a fearful heart, and could not resist them.
<br>8	And now you say that you are able to with- stand the kingdom of the Lord, which he posses- seth by the sons of David, and you have a great multitude of people, and golden calves, which Jeroboam hath made you for gods.
<br>9	And you have cast out the priests of the Lord, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites: and you have made you priests, like all the nations of the earth: whosoever cometh and consecrateth his hand with a bullock of the herd, and with seven rams, is made a priest of those who are no gods.
<br>10	But the Lord is our God, whom we forsake not, and the priests who minister to the Lord are the sons of Aaron, and the Levites are in their order.
<br>11	And they offer holocausts to the Lord, every day, morning and evening, and incense made according to the ordinance of the law, and the loaves are set forth on a most clean table, and there is with us the golden candlestick, and the lamps thereof, to be lighted always in the evening: for we keep the precepts of the Lord
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>our God, whom you have forsaken.
<br>12	Therefore God is the leader in our army, and his priests who sound with trumpets, and resound against you: O children of Israel, fight not against the Lord the God of your fathers, for it is not good for you.
<br>13	While he spoke these things, Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind him. And while he stood facing the enemies, he encompassed Juda, who perceived it not, with his army.
<br>14	And when Juda looked back, they saw the battle coming upon them both before and be- hind, and they cried to the Lord: and the priests began to sound with the trumpets.
<br>15	And all the men of Juda shouted: and behold when they shouted, God terrified Jer- oboam, and all Israel that stood against Abia and Juda.
<br>16	And the children of Israel fled before Juda, and the Lord delivered them into their hand.
<br>17	And Abia and his people slew them with a great slaughter, and there fell wounded of Israel five hundred thousand valiant men.
<br>18	And the children of Israel were brought down, at that time, and the children of Juda were exceedingly strengthened, because they had trusted in the Lord the God of their fathers.
<br>19	And Abia pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel and her daughters, and Jesana with her daughters, Ephron also and her daughters.
<br>20	And Jeroboam was not able to resist any more, in the days of Abia: and the Lord struck him, and he died.
<br>21	But Abia, being strengthened in his king- dom, took fourteen wives: and begot two and twenty sons, and sixteen daughters.
<br>22	And the rest of the acts of Abia, and of his ways and works, are written diligently in the
<br> 
<br>book of Addo the prophet.
<br>
<br>Chapter 14
<br>And Abia slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: an Asa his son reigned in his stead: in his days the land was quiet ten years.
<br>2	And Asa did that which was good and pleas- ing in the sight of his God, and he destroyed the altars of foreign worship, and the high places.
<br>3	And broke the statues, and cut down the groves.
<br>4	And he commanded Juda to seek the Lord the God of their fathers, and to do the law, and all the commandments.
<br>5	And he took away out of all the cities of Juda the altars, and temples, and reigned in peace.
<br>6	He built also strong cities in Juda, for he was quiet, and there had no wars risen in his time, the Lord giving peace.
<br>7	And he said to Juda: Let us build these cities, and compass them with walls, and fortify them with towers, and gates, and bars, while all is quiet from wars, because we have sought the Lord the God of our fathers, and he hath given us peace round about. So they built, and there was no hinderance in building.
<br>8	And Asa had in his army of men that bore shields and spears of Juda three hundred thou- sand, and of Benjamin that bore shields and drew bows, two hundred and eighty thousand, all these were most valiant men.
<br>9	And Zara the Ethiopian came out against them with his army of ten hundred thousand men, and with three hundred chariots: and he came as far as Maresa.
<br>10	And Asa went out to meet him, and set his army in array for battle in the vale of Sephata,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>which is near Maresa:
<br>11	And he called upon the Lord God, and said: Lord, there is no difference with thee, whether thou help with few, or with many: help us, O Lord our God: for with confidence in thee, and in thy name we are come against this multitude. O Lord thou art our God, let not man prevail against thee.
<br>12	And the Lord terrified the Ethiopians be- fore Asa and Juda: and the Ethiopians fled.
<br>13	And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them to Gerara: and the Ethiopians fell even to utter destruction, for the Lord slew them, and his army fought against them, and they were destroyed. And they took abundance of spoils,
<br>14	And they took all the cities round about Gerara: for a great fear was come upon all men: and they pillaged the cities, and carried off much booty.
<br>15	And they destroyed the sheepcotes, and took an infinite number of cattle, and of camels: and returned to Jerusalem.
<br>
<br>Chapter 15
<br>And the spirit of God came upon Azarias the son of Oded,
<br>2	And he went out to meet Asa, and said to him: Hear ye me, Asa, and all Juda and Ben- jamin: The Lord is with you, because you have been with him. If you seek him, you shall find: but if you forsake him, he will forsake you.
<br>3	And many days shall pass in Israel, without the true God, and without a priest a teacher, and without the law.
<br>4	And when in their distress they shall return to the Lord the God of Israel, and shall seek him, they shall find him.
<br> 
<br>5	At that time there shall be no peace to him that goeth out and cometh in, but terrors on every side among all the inhabitants of the earth. 6 For nation shall fight against nation, and city against city, for the Lord will trouble them
<br>with all distress.
<br>7	Do you therefore take courage, and let not your hands be weakened: for there shall be a reward for your work.
<br>8	And when Asa had heard the words, and the prophecy of Azarias the son of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and took away the idols out of all the land of Juda, and out of Benjamin, and out of the cities of mount Ephraim, which he had taken, and he dedicated the altar of the Lord, which was before the porch of the Lord.
<br>9	And he gathered together all Juda and Ben- jamin, and the strangers with them of Ephraim, and Manasses, and Simeon: for many were come over to him out of Israel, seeing that the Lord his God was with him.
<br>10	And when they were come to Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa,
<br>11	They sacrificed to the Lord in that day of the spoils, and of the prey, that they had brought, seven hundred oxen, and seven thou- sand rams.
<br>12	And he went in to confirm as usual the covenant, that they should seek the Lord the God of their fathers with all their heart, and with all their soul.
<br>13	And if any one, said he, seek not the Lord the God of Israel, let him die, whether little or great, man or woman.
<br>14	And they swore to the Lord with a loud voice with joyful shouting, and with sound of trumpet, and sound of cornets,
<br>15	All that were in Juda with a curse: for with all their heart they swore, and with all their will
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>they sought him, and they found him, and the Lord gave them rest round about.
<br>16	Moreover Maacha the mother of king Asa he deposed from the royal authority, because she had made in a grove an idol of Priapus: and he entirely destroyed it, and breaking it into pieces, burnt it at the torrent Cedron.
<br>17	But high places were left in Israel:  never- theless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days. 18 And the things which his father had vowed, and he himself had vowed, he brought into the house of the Lord, gold and silver, and vessels of
<br>divers uses.
<br>19 And there was no war unto the five and thirtieth year of the kingdom of Asa.
<br>
<br>Chapter 16
<br>And in the six and thirtieth year of his kingdom, Baasa the king of Israel came up against Juda, and built a wall about Rama, that no one might safely go out or come in of the kingdom of Asa. 2 Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the Lord, and of the king’s treasures, and sent to Benadad king
<br>of Syria, who dwelt in Damascus, saying:
<br>3	There is a league between me and thee, as there was between my father and thy father, wherefore I have sent thee silver and gold, that thou mayst break thy league with Baasa king of Israel, and make him depart from me.
<br>4	And when Benadad heard this, he sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel: and they took Ahion, and Dan, and Abelmaim, and all the walled cities of Nephtali.
<br>5	And when Baasa heard of it, he left off the building of Rama, and interrupted his work.
<br>6	Then king Asa took all Juda, and they car- ried away from Rama the stones, and the timber
<br> 
<br>that Baasa had prepared for the building: and he built with them Gabaa, and Maspha.
<br>7	At that time Hanani the prophet came to Asa king of Juda, and said to him: Because thou hast had confidence in the king of Syria, and not in the Lord thy God, therefore hath the army of the king of Syria escaped out of thy hand.
<br>8	Were not the Ethiopians, and the Libyans much more numerous in chariots, and horsemen, and an exceeding great multitude: yet because thou trustedst in the Lord, he delivered them into thy hand?
<br>9	For the eyes of the Lord behold all the earth, and give strength to those who with a perfect heart trust in him. Wherefore thou hast done foolishly, and for this cause from this time wars shall arise against thee.
<br>10	And Asa was angry with the seer, and com- manded him to be put in prison: for he was greatly enraged because of this thing: and he put to death many of the people at that time.
<br>11	But the works of Asa the first and last are written in the book of the kings of Juda and Israel.
<br>12	And Asa fell sick in the nine and thirtieth year of his reign, of a most violent pain in his feet, and yet in his illness he did not seek the Lord, but rather trusted in the skill of physicians.
<br>13	And he slept with his fathers: and he died in the one and fortieth year of his reign.
<br>14	And they buried him in his own sepulchre, which he had made for himself in the city of David: and they laid him on his bed full of spices and odoriferous ointments, which were made by the art of the perfumers, and they burnt them over him with very great pomp.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 17
<br>And Josaphat his son reigned in his stead, and grew strong against Israel.
<br>2	And he placed numbers of soldiers in all the fortified cities of Juda. And he put garrisons in the land of Juda, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.
<br>3	And the Lord was with Josaphat, because he walked in the first ways of David his father: and trusted not in Baalim,
<br>4	But in the God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not according to the sins of Israel.
<br>5	And the Lord established the kingdom in his hand, and all Juda brought presents to Josaphat: and he acquired immense riches, and much glory. 6 And when his heart had taken courage for the ways of the Lord, he took away also the high
<br>places and the groves out of Juda.
<br>7	And in the third year of his reign, he sent of his princes Benhail, and Abdias, and Zacharias, and Nathanael, and Micheas, to teach in the cites of Juda:
<br>8	And with them the Levites, Semeias, and Nathanias, and Zabadias, and Asael, and Semi- ramoth, and Jonathan, and Adonias, and To- bias, and Thobadonias Levites, and with them Elisama, and Joram priests.
<br>9	And they taught the people in Juda, hav- ing with them the book of the law of the Lord: and they went about all the cities of Juda, and instructed the people.
<br>10	And the fear of the Lord came upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about Juda, and they durst not make war against Jos- aphat.
<br>11	The Philistines also brought presents to Josaphat, and tribute in silver, and the Arabians brought him cattle, seven thousand seven hun-
<br> 
<br>dred rams, and as many he goats.
<br>12	And Josaphat grew, and became exceeding great: and he built in Juda houses like towers, and walled cities.
<br>13	And he prepared many works in the cities of Juda: and he had warriors, and valiant men in Jerusalem.
<br>14	Of whom this is the number of the houses and families of every one: in Juda captains of the army, Ednas the chief, and with him three hundred thousand most valiant men.
<br>15	After him Johanan the captain, and with him two hundred and eighty thousand.
<br>16	And after him was Amasias the son of Zechri, consecrated to the Lord, and with him were two hundred thousand valiant men.
<br>17	After him was Eliada valiant in battle, and with him two hundred thousand armed with bow and shield.
<br>18	After him also was Jozabad, and with him a hundred and eighty thousand ready for war.
<br>19	All these were at the hand of the king, be- side others, whom he had put in the walled cities, in all Juda.
<br>
<br>Chapter 18
<br>Now Josaphat was rich and very glorious, and was joined by affinity to Achab.
<br>2	And he went down to him after some years to Samaria: and Achab at his coming killed sheep and oxen in abundance for him and the people that came with him: and he persuaded him to go up to Ramoth Galaad.
<br>3	And Achab king of Israel said to Josaphat king of Juda: Come with me to Ramoth Galaad. And he answered him: Thou art as I am, and my people as thy people, and we will be with thee in the war.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>4	And Josaphat said to the king of Israel: In- quire, I beseech thee, at present the word of the Lord.
<br>5	So the king of Israel gathered together of the prophets four hundred men, and he said to them: Shall we go to Ramoth Galaad to fight, or shall we forbear? But they said: Go up, and God will deliver into the king’s hand.
<br>6	And Josaphat said: Is there not here a prophet of the Lord, that we may inquire also of him?
<br>7	And the king of Israel said to Josaphat: There is one man, of whom we may ask the will of the Lord: but I hate him, for he never proph- esieth good to me, but always evil: and it is Micheas the son of Jemla. And Josaphat said: Speak not thus, O king.
<br>8	And the king of Israel called one of the eu- nuchs, and said to him: Call quickly Micheas the son of Jemla.
<br>9	Now the king of Israel, and Josaphat king of Juda, both sat on their thrones, clothed in royal robes, and they sat in the open court by the gate of Samaria, and all the prophets prophesied before them.
<br>10	And Sedecias the son of Chanaana made him horns of iron, and said: Thus saith the Lord: With these shalt thou push Syria, till thou de- stroy it.
<br>11	And all the prophets prophesied in like manner, and said: Go up to Ramoth Galaad, and thou shalt prosper, and the Lord will de- liver them into the king’s hand.
<br>12	And the messenger that went to call Micheas, said to him: Behold the words of all the prophets with one mouth declare good to the king: I beseech thee therefore let not thy word disagree with them, and speak thou also good success.
<br>13	And Micheas answered him: As the Lord
<br> 
<br>liveth, whatsoever my God shall say to me, that will I speak.
<br>14	So he came to the king: and the king said to him: Micheas, shall we go to Ramoth Galaad to fight, or forbear? And he answered him: Go up, for all shall succeed prosperously, and the enemies shall be delivered into your hands.
<br>15	And the king said: I adjure thee again and again to say nothing but the truth to me, in the name of the Lord.
<br>16	Then he said: I saw all Israel scattered in the mountains, like sheep without a shepherd: and the Lord said: These have no masters: let every man return to his own house in peace.
<br>17	And the king of Israel said to Josaphat: Did I not tell thee that this man would not prophesy me any good, but evil?
<br>18	Then he said: Hear ye therefore the word of the Lord: I saw the Lord sitting on his throne, and all the army of heaven standing by him on the right hand and on the left,
<br>19	And the Lord said: Who shall deceive Achab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall in Ramoth Galaad? And when one spoke in this manner, and another otherwise:
<br>20	There came forth a spirit, and stood before the Lord, and said: I will deceive him. And the Lord said to him: By what means wilt thou deceive him?
<br>21	And he answered: I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And the Lord said: Thou shalt deceive, and shalt prevail: go out, and do so.
<br>22	Now therefore behold the Lord hath put a spirit of lying in the mouth of all thy prophets, and the Lord hath spoken evil against thee.
<br>23	And Sedecias the son of Chanaana came, and struck Micheas on the cheek and said: Which way went the spirit of the Lord from me, to speak to thee?
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>24	And Micheas said: Thou thyself shalt see in that day, when thou shalt go in from chamber to chamber, to hide thyself.
<br>25	And the king of Israel commanded, saying: Take Micheas, and carry him to Amon the gov- ernor of the city, and to Joas the son of Amelech,
<br>26	And say: Thus saith the king: Put this fellow in prison, and give him bread and water in a small quantity till I return in peace.
<br>27	And Micheas said: If thou return in peace, the Lord hath not spoken by me. And he said: Hear, all ye people.
<br>28	So the king of Israel and Josaphat king of Juda went up to Ramoth Galaad.
