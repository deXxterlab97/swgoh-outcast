<br>(A) Requirements for the Secretary
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall—
<br>
<br>(i) enable each student who, based on an unusual circumstance described in section 1087vv(d)(9) of this title, may qualify for an adjustment under subsection (a)(1)(B) that will result in a determination of independence under this section or section 1087uu–2 of this title to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid as an independent student for the purpose of a provisional determination of the student's Federal financial aid award, with the final determination of the award subject to the documentation requirements of subsection (a)(3);
<br>
<br>(ii) upon completion of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid provide an estimate of the student's Federal Pell Grant award, and other information as specified in section 1090(a)(3)(A) of this title, based on the assumption that the student is determined to be an independent student; and
<br>
<br>(iii) specify, on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, the consequences under section 1097(a) of this title of knowingly and willfully completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid as an independent student under clause (i) without meeting the unusual circumstances to qualify for such a determination.
<br>(B) Requirements for financial aid administrators
<br>
<br>With respect to a student accepted for admission who completes the Free Application for Federal Student Aid as an independent student under subparagraph (A), a financial aid administrator shall—
<br>
<br>(i) notify the student of the institutional process, requirements, and timeline for an adjustment under this section and section 1087vv(d)(9) of this title that will result in a review of the student's request for an adjustment and a determination of the student's dependency status under such sections within a reasonable time after the student completes the Free Application for Federal Student Aid;
<br>
<br>(ii) provide the student a final determination of the student's dependency status and Federal financial aid award as soon as practicable after all requested documentation is provided;
<br>
<br>(iii) retain all documents related to the adjustment under this section and section 1087vv(d)(9) of this title, including documented interviews, for at least the duration of the student's enrollment, and shall abide by all other record keeping requirements of this chapter; and
<br>
<br>(iv) presume that any student who has obtained an adjustment under this section and section 1087vv(d)(9) of this title and a final determination of independence for any preceding award year at an institution of higher education to be independent for each subsequent award year at the same institution unless—
<br>
<br>(I) the student informs the institution that circumstances have changed; or
<br>
<br>(II) the institution has specific conflicting information about the student's independence.
<br>(C) Eligibility
<br>
<br>If a student pursues provisional independent student status and is not determined to be an independent student by a financial aid administrator, such student shall only be eligible for a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan for that award year unless such student subsequently completes the Free Application for Federal Student Aid as a dependent student.
<br>(d) Adjustments to assets or income taken into account
<br>
<br>A financial aid administrator shall be considered to be making a necessary adjustment in accordance with this section if—
<br>
<br>(1) the administrator makes adjustments excluding from family income or assets any proceeds or losses from a sale of farm or business assets of a family if such sale results from a voluntary or involuntary foreclosure, forfeiture, or bankruptcy or a voluntary or involuntary liquidation; or
<br>
<br>(2) the administrator makes adjustments for a condition of disability of a student, or in the case of a dependent student, the dependent student's parent or guardian, or in the case of an independent student, the independent student's dependent or spouse, so as to take into consideration the additional costs incurred as a result of such disability.
<br>(e) Refusal or adjustment of loan certifications
<br>
<br>On a case-by-case basis, an eligible institution may refuse to use the authority provided under this section, certify a statement that permits a student to receive a loan under part D, certify a loan amount, or make a loan that is less than the student's determination of need (as determined under this part), if the reason for the action is documented and provided in writing to the student. No eligible institution shall discriminate against any borrower or applicant in obtaining a loan on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, marital status, age, or disability status.
<br>(f) Special rule regarding professional judgment during a disaster, emergency, or economic downturn
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>For the purposes of making a professional judgment under this section, financial aid administrators may, during a qualifying emergency—
<br>
<br>(A) determine that the income earned from work for an applicant is zero, if the applicant can provide paper or electronic documentation of receipt of unemployment benefits or confirmation that an application for unemployment benefits was submitted; and
<br>
<br>(B) make additional appropriate adjustments to the income earned from work for a student, parent, or spouse, as applicable, based on the totality of the family's situation, including consideration of unemployment benefits.
<br>(2) Documentation
<br>
<br>For the purposes of documenting unemployment under paragraph (1), documentation shall be accepted if such documentation is submitted not more than 90 days from the date on which such documentation was issued, except if a financial aid administrator knows that the student, parent, or spouse, as applicable, has already obtained other employment.
<br>(3) Program reviews
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall make adjustments to the model used to select institutions of higher education participating under this subchapter for program reviews in order to account for any rise in the use of professional judgment under this section during the award years applicable to the qualifying emergency, as determined by the Secretary.
<br>(4) Qualifying emergency
<br>
<br>In this subsection, the term "qualifying emergency" means—
<br>
<br>(A) an event for which the President declared a major disaster or an emergency under section 5170 or 5191, respectively, of title 42;
<br>
<br>(B) a national emergency related to the coronavirus declared by the President under section 1621 of title 50; or

<br>
<br>In making a determination of independence under section 1087vv(d)(8) of this title, a financial aid administrator shall comply with the following:
<br>
<br>(1) Consider documentation of the student's circumstance to be adequate in the absence of documented conflicting information, if such documentation is provided through a documented phone call, written statement, or verifiable electronic data match by—
<br>
<br>(A) a local educational agency homeless liaison, designated pursuant to section 11432(g)(1)(J)(ii) of title 42 or a designee of the liaison;

<br>(D) a financial aid administrator at another institution who documented the student's circumstance in a prior award year.
<br>
<br>(2) If a student is unable to provide documentation from any individual described in paragraph (1), make a case-by-case determination, which shall be—

<br>
<br>(B) made without regard to the reasons that the student is an unaccompanied homeless youth, or unaccompanied, at risk of homelessness, and self-supporting.
