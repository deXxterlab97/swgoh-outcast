<br>Pub. L. 104–132, title IX, §901(a), Apr. 24, 1996, 110 Stat. 1317, provided that: "The Congress declares that all the territorial sea of the United States, as defined by Presidential Proclamation 5928 of December 27, 1988 [set out as a note under section 1331 of Title 43, Public Lands], for purposes of Federal criminal jurisdiction is part of the United States, subject to its sovereignty, and is within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States for the purposes of title 18, United States Code."

<br>(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 685.)
<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §261 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §147, 35 Stat. 1115; Jan. 27, 1938, ch. 10, §3, 52 Stat. 7).
<br>
<br>The terms of this section were general enough to justify its inclusion in this chapter rather than retaining it in the chapter on "Counterfeiting" where the terms which it specifically defines are set out in sections 471–476, 478, 481, 483, 492, and 504 of this title.
<br>
<br>Words "Federal Reserve notes, Federal Reserve bank notes" were inserted before "coupons" because such notes have almost supplanted national bank currency.
<br>
<br>Minor changes were made in phraseology.
<br>§9. Vessel of the United States defined
<br>
<br>The term "vessel of the United States", as used in this title, means a vessel belonging in whole or in part to the United States, or any citizen thereof, or any corporation created by or under the laws of the United States, or of any State, Territory, District, or possession thereof.
<br>
<br>(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 685.)
<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §501 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §310, 35 Stat. 1148).
<br>
<br>Section is made applicable to the entire title rather than to sections 481 et seq. of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed.
<br>
<br>Minor changes in phraseology were made.
<br>§10. Interstate commerce and foreign commerce defined
<br>
<br>The term "interstate commerce", as used in this title, includes commerce between one State, Territory, Possession, or the District of Columbia and another State, Territory, Possession, or the District of Columbia.
<br>
<br>The term "foreign commerce", as used in this title, includes commerce with a foreign country.
<br>
<br>(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 686.)
<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§408, 408b, 414(a), and 419a(b) (Oct. 29, 1919, ch. 89, §2(b), 41 Stat. 325; June 22, 1932, ch. 271, §2, 47 Stat. 326; May 18, 1934, ch. 301, 48 Stat. 782; May 22, 1934, ch. 333, §2(a), 48 Stat. 794; Aug. 18, 1941, ch. 366, §2(b), 55 Stat. 631).
<br>
<br>This section consolidates into one section identical definitions contained in sections 408, 408b, 414(a), and 419a(b) of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed.
<br>
<br>In addition to slight improvements in style, the word "commerce" was substituted for "transportation" in order to avoid the narrower connotation of the word "transportation" since "commerce" obviously includes more than "transportation." The word "Possession" was inserted in two places to make the definition more accurate and comprehensive since the places included in the word "Possession" would normally be within the term defined and a narrower construction should be handled by express statutory exclusion in those crimes which Congress intends to restrict to commerce within the continental United States.
<br>§11. Foreign government defined
<br>
<br>The term "foreign government", as used in this title except in sections 112, 878, 970, 1116, and 1201, includes any government, faction, or body of insurgents within a country with which the United States is at peace, irrespective of recognition by the United States.

<br>(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 686; Pub. L. 94–467, §11, Oct. 8, 1976, 90 Stat. 2001.)
<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§98, 288, 349; section 235 of title 22 U.S.C., 1940 ed., Foreign Relations and Intercourse; section 41 of title 50, U.S.C., 1940 ed., War and National Defense (June 15, 1917, ch. 30, title VIII, §4, 40 Stat. 226).
<br>
<br>The definition of "foreign government" contained in this section, with minor changes in phraseology, is from section 4 of title VIII of act June 15, 1917 (Ch. 30, 40 Stat. 217, 226), known as the Espionage Act of 1917. This definition was incorporated in sections 98, 288, and 349 of title 18 and in section 235 of title 22, Foreign Relations and Intercourse, and in section 41 of Title 50, War and National Defense, U.S.C., all in 1940 ed., since the definition was specifically enacted with reference to said sections and others not material here.
<br>
<br>The remaining provisions of said sections 98 and 349 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which were derived from sources other than said section 4 of title VIII of the act of June 15, 1917, are incorporated in sections 502 and 957 of this title.

Any limitation on the right or privilege to operate a motor vehicle imposed under this subsection shall apply only to the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) In addition to any term of imprisonment provided for operating a motor vehicle under the influence of a drug or alcohol imposed under the law of a State, territory, possession, or district, the punishment for such an offense under this section shall include an additional term of imprisonment of not more than 1 year, or if serious bodily injury of a minor is caused, not more than 5 years, or if death of a minor is caused, not more than 10 years, and an additional fine under this title, or both, if—
<br>
<br>(i) a minor (other than the offender) was present in the motor vehicle when the offense was committed; and

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §468 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §289, 35 Stat. 1145; June 15, 1933, ch. 85, 48 Stat. 152; June 20, 1935, ch. 284, 49 Stat. 394; June 6, 1940, ch. 241, 54 Stat. 234).
<br>
<br>Act March 4, 1909, §289 used the words "now in force" when referring to the laws of any State, organized Territory or district, to be considered in force.
<br>
<br>As amended on June 15, 1933, the words "by the laws thereof in force on June 1, 1933, and remaining in force at the time of the doing or omitting the doing of such act or thing, would be penal," were used.
<br>
<br>The amendment of June 20, 1935, extended the date to "April 1, 1935," and the amendment of June 6, 1940, extended the date to "February 1, 1940".
<br>
<br>The revised section omits the specification of any date as unnecessary in a revision, which speaks from the date of its enactment. Such omission will not only make effective within Federal reservations, the local State laws in force on the date of the enactment of the revision, but will authorize the Federal courts to apply the same measuring stick to such offenses as is applied in the adjoining State under future changes of the State law and will make unnecessary periodic pro forma amendments of this section to keep abreast of changes of local laws. In other words, the revised section makes applicable to offenses committed on such reservations, the law of the place that would govern if the reservation had not been ceded to the United States.
<br>
<br>The word "Possession" was inserted to clarify scope of section.
<br>
<br>Minor changes were made in phraseology.

<br>2010—Subsec. (a)(1). Pub. L. 111–148, §10606(c)(1), substituted "or section 1128B of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320a–7b); or" for semicolon.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>The criminal provisions of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, sections 703–711 of title 16, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Conservation, and the Migratory Bird Conservation Act, sections 715–715r of title 16, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Conservation, were considered for inclusion in this chapter. Since these provisions, except parts of sections 704–707 of said title 16, are so inextricably interwoven with the Migratory Bird Acts, it was found advisable to exclude them.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §145 and §§676, 682, 683, 685, 688, 689b, 692a, and 694a of title 16, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Conservation (Jan. 24, 1905, ch. 137, §2, 33 Stat. 614; June 29, 1906, ch. 3593, §2, 34 Stat. 607; Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §84, 35 Stat. 1104; Aug. 11, 1916, ch. 313, 39 Stat. 476; June 5, 1920, ch. 247, §2, 41 Stat. 986; Apr. 15, 1924, ch. 108, 43 Stat. 98; Feb. 28, 1925, ch. 376, 43 Stat. 1091; July 3, 1926, ch. 744, §6, 44 Stat. 821; July 3, 1926, ch. 776, §3, 44 Stat. 889; June 28, 1930, ch. 709, §2, 46 Stat. 828; Mar. 10, 1934, ch. 54, §2, 48 Stat. 400; Reorg. Plan No. II, §4(f), 4 F.R. 2731, 53 Stat. 1433).
<br>
<br>This revised section condenses, consolidates, and simplifies similar provisions of sections 676, 682, 683, 685, 688, 689b, 692a, and 694a of title 16, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with section 145 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with such changes of phraseology as make clear the intent of Congress to protect all wildlife within Federal sanctuaries, refuges, fish hatcheries, and breeding grounds. Irrelevant provisions of such sections in title 16 are to be retained in that title.
<br>
<br>Because of the general nature of this consolidated section, no specific reference is made to rules and regulations issued by the Secretary of the Interior or any other personage, but only to rules and regulations "promulgated by authority of law".
<br>
<br>The punishment provided by the sections consolidated varied from a fine not exceeding $100 or imprisonment not exceeding 6 months, or both, in section 694a of title 16, U.S.C., 1940 ed., to a fine not exceeding $1,000 or imprisonment not exceeding 1 year, or both, in sections 676, 685, and 688 of such title 16. The revised section adopts the punishment provisions of the other five sections.
<br>
<br>The references to "misdemeanor" in sections 676, 685, 688, 689b, 692a, and 694a of title 16, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of "misdemeanor" in section 1 of this title, and also to conform with policy followed by codifiers of the 1909 Criminal Code, as stated in Senate Report 10, part 1, pages 12, 13, 14, Sixtieth Congress, first session, to accompany S. 2982.
<br>
<br>Words "upon conviction", contained in sections 676, 685, 688, 689b, 692a, and 694a of title 16, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted as surplusage, because punishment can be imposed only after conviction.
<br>
<br>Words "in any United States court of competent jurisdiction", in sections 676, 685, and 688 of title 16, U.S.C., 1940 ed., words "in any United States court", in sections 689b, 692a, and 694a of such title 16, and words "in the discretion of the court", in said sections 676, 685, 688, and 689b, were likewise omitted as surplusage.
<br>
<br>Editorial Notes
<br>Amendments
<br>
<br>1994—Pub. L. 103–322 substituted "fined under this title" for "fined not more than $500".
<br>§42. Importation or shipment of injurious mammals, birds, fish (including mollusks and crustacea), amphibia, and reptiles; permits, specimens for museums; regulations
<br>
<br>(a)(1) The importation into the United States, any territory of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or any possession of the United States, or any shipment between the continental United States, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or any possession of the United States, of the mongoose of the species Herpestes auropunctatus; of the species of so-called "flying foxes" or fruit bats of the genus Pteropus; of the zebra mussel of the species Dreissena polymorpha; of the quagga mussel of the species Dreissena rostriformis or Dreissena bugensis; of the bighead carp of the species Hypophthalmichthys nobilis; and such other species of wild mammals, wild birds, fish (including mollusks and crustacea), amphibians, reptiles, brown tree snakes, or the offspring or eggs of any of the foregoing which the Secretary of the Interior may prescribe by regulation to be injurious to human beings, to the interests of agriculture, horticulture, forestry, or to wildlife or the wildlife resources of the United States, is hereby prohibited. All such prohibited mammals, birds, fish (including mollusks and crustacea), amphibians, and reptiles, and the eggs or offspring therefrom, shall be promptly exported or destroyed at the expense of the importer or consignee. Nothing in this section shall be construed to repeal or modify any provision of the Public Health Service Act or Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Also, this section shall not authorize any action with respect to the importation of any plant pest as defined in the Federal Plant Pest Act,1 insofar as such importation is subject to regulation under that Act.
<br>
<br>(2) As used in this subsection, the term "wild" relates to any creatures that, whether or not raised in captivity, normally are found in a wild state; and the terms "wildlife" and "wildlife resources" include those resources that comprise wild mammals, wild birds, fish (including mollusks and crustacea), and all other classes of wild creatures whatsoever, and all types of aquatic and land vegetation upon which such wildlife resources are dependent.
<br>
<br>(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Secretary of the Interior, when he finds that there has been a proper showing of responsibility and continued protection of the public interest and health, shall permit the importation for zoological, educational, medical, and scientific purposes of any mammals, birds, fish (including mollusks and crustacea), amphibia, and reptiles, or the offspring or eggs thereof, where such importation would be prohibited otherwise by or pursuant to this Act, and this Act shall not restrict importations by Federal agencies for their own use.
<br>
<br>(4) Nothing in this subsection shall restrict the importation of dead natural-history specimens for museums or for scientific collections, or the importation of domesticated canaries, parrots (including all other species of psittacine birds), or such other cage birds as the Secretary of the Interior may designate.
<br>
<br>(5) The Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of the Interior shall enforce the provisions of this subsection, including any regulations issued hereunder, and, if requested by the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of the Treasury may require the furnishing of an appropriate bond when desirable to insure compliance with such provisions.
<br>
<br>(b) Whoever violates this section, or any regulation issued pursuant thereto, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than six months, or both.
<br>
<br>(c) The Secretary of the Interior within one hundred and eighty days of the enactment of the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 shall prescribe such requirements and issue such permits as he may deem necessary for the transportation of wild animals and birds under humane and healthful conditions, and it shall be unlawful for any person, including any importer, knowingly to cause or permit any wild animal or bird to be transported to the United States, or any Territory or district thereof, under inhumane or unhealthful conditions or in violation of such requirements. In any criminal prosecution for violation of this subsection and in any administrative proceeding for the suspension of the issuance of further permits—
<br>
<br>(1) the condition of any vessel or conveyance, or the enclosures in which wild animals or birds are confined therein, upon its arrival in the United States, or any Territory or district thereof, shall constitute relevant evidence in determining whether the provisions of this subsection have been violated; and
<br>
<br>(2) the presence in such vessel or conveyance at such time of a substantial ratio of dead, crippled, diseased, or starving wild animals or birds shall be deemed prima facie evidence of the violation of the provisions of this subsection.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>1948 Act
<br>
<br>Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§391, 394 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §§241, 244, 35 Stat. 1137, 1138; June 15, 1935, ch. 261, title II, §201, 49 Stat. 381; Reorg. Plan No. II, §4(f), 4 F.R. 2731, 53 Stat. 1433).
<br>
<br>This section consolidates the provisions of sections 391 and 394 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., as subsections (a) and (b), respectively.
<br>
<br>In subsection (a) the words "Territory or District thereof" were omitted as unnecessary in view of the definition of the United States in section 5 of this title.
<br>
<br>In subsection (b) the words "upon conviction thereof", were omitted as surplusage because punishment can only be imposed after conviction.
<br>
<br>The amount of the fine was reduced from $1,000 to $500, thus making the violation a petty offense as defined in section 1 of this title. (See also section 41 of this title which provides a similar punishment.)
<br>
<br>Minor verbal changes were also made.
<br>1949 Act
<br>
<br>This section [section 2] incorporates in section 42 of title 18, U.S.C., with slight changes in phraseology, the provisions of act of June 29, 1948 (ch. 716, 62 Stat. 1096), which became law subsequent to the enactment of the revision of title 18.
