<br>(2) Criteria and consideration
<br>
<br>The Quality Assurance Program authorized by this section shall be based on criteria that include demonstrated institutional performance, as determined by the Secretary, and shall take into consideration current quality assurance goals, as determined by the Secretary. The selection criteria shall ensure the participation of a diverse group of institutions of higher education with respect to size, mission, and geographical distribution.
<br>(3) Waiver
<br>
<br>The Secretary is authorized to waive for any institution participating in the Quality Assurance Program any regulations dealing with reporting or verification requirements in this subchapter that are addressed by the institution's alternative management system, and may substitute such quality assurance reporting as the Secretary determines necessary to ensure accountability and compliance with the purposes of the programs under this subchapter.

<br>(5) Review and evaluation
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall review and evaluate the Quality Assurance Program conducted by each participating institution and, on the basis of that evaluation, make recommendations regarding amendments to this chapter that will streamline the administration and enhance the integrity of Federal student assistance programs. Such recommendations shall be submitted to the authorizing committees.
<br>(b) Regulatory improvement and streamlining experiments
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall continue the voluntary participation of any experimental sites in existence as of July 1, 2007, unless the Secretary determines that such site's participation has not been successful in carrying out the purposes of this section. Any experimental sites approved by the Secretary prior to such date that have not been successful in carrying out the purposes of this section shall be discontinued not later than June 30, 2010.

<br>(4) Determination of success
<br>
<br>For the purposes of paragraph (1), the Secretary shall make a determination of success regarding an institution's participation as an experimental site based on—
<br>
<br>(A) the ability of the experimental site to reduce administrative burdens to the institution, as documented in the Secretary's biennial report under paragraph (2), without creating costs for the taxpayer; and
<br>
<br>(B) whether the experimental site has improved the delivery of services to, or otherwise benefitted, students.
