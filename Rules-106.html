<br>(a) PAYGO estimates
<br>(1) Required designation in PAYGO Acts
<br>(A) House of Representatives
<br>
<br>To establish the budgetary effects of a PAYGO Act consistent with the determination made by the Chairman of the House Budget Committee, a PAYGO Act originated in or amended by the House of Representatives may include the following statement: "The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go-Act 1 of 2010, shall be determined by reference to the latest statement titled 'Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation' for this Act, submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.".
<br>(B) Senate

<br>To establish the budgetary effects of a PAYGO Act consistent with the determination made by the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, a PAYGO Act originated in or amended by the Senate shall include the following statement: "The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go-Act 1 of 2010, shall be determined by reference to the latest statement titled 'Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation' for this Act, submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, provided that such statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.".
<br>(C) Conference reports and amendments between the Houses
<br>
<br>To establish the budgetary effects of the conference report on a PAYGO Act, or an amendment to an amendment between Houses on a PAYGO Act, which if estimated shall be estimated jointly by the Chairmen of the House and Senate Budget Committees, the conference report or amendment between the Houses shall include the following statement: "The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go-Act 1 of 2010, shall be determined by reference to the latest statement titled 'Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation' for this Act, jointly submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the Chairmen of the House and Senate Budget Committees, provided that such statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage in the House acting first on this conference report or amendment between the Houses.".
<br>(2) Determination of budgetary effects of PAYGO Acts
<br>(A) Original legislation
<br>(i) Statement and estimate
<br>
<br>Prior to a vote on passage of a PAYGO Act originated or amended by one House, the Chairman of the Budget Committee of that House may submit for printing in the Congressional Record a statement titled "Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation" which shall include an estimate of the budgetary effects of that Act, if available prior to passage of the Act by that House and shall submit, if applicable, an identification of any current policy adjustments made pursuant to section 936 of this title. The timely submission of such a statement, in conjunction with the appropriate designation made pursuant to paragraph (1)(A) or (1)(B), as applicable, shall establish the budgetary effects of the PAYGO Act for the purposes of this Act.
<br>(ii) Effect
<br>
<br>The latest statement submitted by the Chairman of the Budget Committee of that House prior to passage shall supersede any prior statements submitted in the Congressional Record and shall be valid only if the PAYGO Act is not further amended by either House.
<br>(iii) Failure to submit estimate
<br>
<br>If—
<br>
<br>(I) the estimate required by clause (i) has not been submitted prior to passage by that House;
<br>
<br>(II) such estimate has been submitted but is no longer valid due to a subsequent amendment to the PAYGO Act; or
<br>
<br>(III) the designation required pursuant to this subsection has not been made;
<br>
<br> the budgetary effects of the PAYGO Act shall be determined under subsection (d)(3), provided that this clause shall not apply if a valid designation is subsequently included in that PAYGO Act pursuant to paragraph (1)(C) and a statement is submitted pursuant to subparagraph (B).
<br>(B) Conference reports and amendments between Houses
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>Prior to the adoption of a report of a committee of conference on a PAYGO Act in either House, or disposition of an amendment to an amendment between Houses on a PAYGO Act, the Chairmen of the Budget Committees of the House and Senate may jointly submit for printing in the Congressional Record a statement titled "Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation" which shall include an estimate of the budgetary effects of that Act if available prior to passage of the Act by the House acting first on the legislation and shall submit, if applicable, an identification of any current policy adjustments made pursuant to section 936 of this title. The timely submission of such a statement, in conjunction with the appropriate designation made pursuant to paragraph (1)(C), shall establish the budgetary effects of the PAYGO Act for the purposes of this Act.
<br>(ii) Failure to submit estimate
<br>
<br>If such estimate has not been submitted prior to the adoption of a report of a committee of conference by either House, or if the designation required pursuant to this subsection has not been made, the budgetary effects of the PAYGO Act shall be determined under subsection (d)(3).
<br>(3) Procedure in the Senate
<br>
<br>In the Senate, upon submission of a statement titled "Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation" by the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee for printing in the Congressional Record, the Legislative Clerk shall read the statement.
<br>(4) Jurisdiction of the Budget Committees
<br>
<br>For the purposes of enforcing section 637 of this title, a designation made pursuant to paragraph (1)(A), (1)(B), or (1)(C), that includes only the language specifically prescribed therein, shall not be considered a matter within the jurisdiction of either the Senate or House Committees on the Budget.
<br>(b) Omitted
<br>(c) Current policy adjustments for certain legislation
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>For any provision of legislation that meets the criteria in subsection (c), (d), (e) or (f) of section 936 of this title, the Chairs of the Committees on the Budget of the House and Senate, as applicable, shall request that CBO adjust the estimate of budgetary effects of that legislation pursuant to paragraph (2) for the purposes of this chapter. A single piece of legislation may contain provisions that meet criteria in more than one of the subsections referred to in the preceding sentence. CBO shall adjust estimates for legislation designated under subsection (a) and estimated under subsection (b). OMB shall adjust estimates for legislation estimated under subsection (d)(3).
<br>(2) Adjustments
<br>(A) Estimates
<br>
<br>CBO or OMB, as applicable, shall exclude from the estimate of budgetary effects any budgetary effects of a provision that meets the criteria in subsection (c), (d), (e) or (f) of section 936 of this title, to the extent that those budgetary effects, when combined with all other excluded budgetary effects of any other previously designated provisions of enacted legislation under the same subsection of section 936 of this title, do not exceed the maximum applicable current policy adjustment defined under the applicable subsection of section 936 of this title for the applicable 10-year period.
<br>(B) Baseline
<br>
<br>Any estimate made pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall be prepared using baseline estimates supplied by the Congressional Budget Office, consistent with section 907 of this title. CBO estimates of legislation adjusted for current policy shall include a separate presentation of costs excluded from the calculation of budgetary effects for the legislation, as well as an updated total of all excluded costs of provisions within subsection (c), (d), or (e) of section 936 of this title, as applicable, and in the case of paragraph (1) of section 936(f) of this title, within any of the subparagraphs (A) through (L) of such paragraph, as applicable.
<br>(3) Limitation on availability of excess savings
<br>(A) Prohibition on use of excess saving 2 for ineligible policies
<br>
<br>To the extent the adjustment for current policy of any provision estimated under this subsection exceeds the estimated budgetary effects of that provision, these excess savings shall not be available to offset the costs of any provisions not otherwise eligible for a current policy adjustment under section 936 of this title, and shall not be counted on the PAYGO scorecards established pursuant to subsections (d)(4) and (d)(5).
<br>(B) Prohibition on use of excess savings across budget areas
<br>
<br>For provisions eligible for a current policy adjustment under subsections (c) through (f) of section 936 of this title, to the extent the adjustment for current policy of any provision exceeds the estimated budgetary effects of that same provision, the excess savings shall be available only to offset the costs of other provisions that qualify for a current policy adjustment in that same subsection. Each paragraph in section 936(f)(1) of this title shall be considered a separate subsection for purposes of this section.
<br>(4) Further guidance on estimating budgetary effects
<br>
<br>Estimates of budgetary effects under this subsection shall be consistent with the guidance provided at section 936(h) of this title.
<br>(5) Inclusion of statement
<br>
<br>For PAYGO legislation adjusted pursuant to section 936 of this title, the Chairman of the House or Senate Budget Committee, as applicable, shall include in any statement titled "Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation", submitted for that legislation pursuant to this section, an explanation of the current policy designation and adjustments.
<br>(d) OMB PAYGO scorecards
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>OMB shall maintain and make publicly available a continuously updated document containing two PAYGO scorecards displaying the budgetary effects of PAYGO legislation as determined under section 639 of this title, applying the look-back requirement in subsection (e) and the averaging requirement in subsection (f), and a separate addendum displaying the estimates of the costs of provisions designated in statute as emergency requirements.
<br>(2) Estimates in legislation
<br>
<br>Except as provided in paragraph (3), in making the calculations for the PAYGO scorecards, OMB shall use the budgetary effects included by reference in the applicable legislation pursuant to subsection (a).
<br>(3) OMB PAYGO estimates
<br>
<br>If a PAYGO Act does not contain a valid reference to its budgetary effects consistent with subsection (a), OMB shall estimate the budgetary effects of that legislation upon its enactment. The OMB estimate shall be based on the approaches to scorekeeping set forth in section 639 of this title, as amended by this title,3 and subsection (g)(4), and shall use the same economic and technical assumptions as used in the most recent budget submitted by the President under section 1105(a) of title 31.
<br>(4) 5-year scorecard
<br>
<br>The first scorecard shall display the budgetary effects of PAYGO legislation in each year over the 5-year period beginning in the budget year.
<br>(5) 10-year scorecard
<br>
<br>The second scorecard shall display the budgetary effects of PAYGO legislation in each year over the 10-year period beginning in the budget year.
<br>(6) Community Living Assistance Services and Supports Act
<br>
<br>Neither scorecard maintained by OMB pursuant to this subsection shall include net savings from any provisions of legislation titled "Community Living Assistance Services and Supports Act", which establishes a Federal insurance program for long-term care, if such legislation is enacted into law, or amended, subsequent to February 12, 2010.
<br>(e) Look-back to capture current-year effects
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, OMB shall treat the budgetary effects of PAYGO legislation enacted during a session of Congress that occur during the current year as though they occurred in the budget year.
<br>(f) Averaging used to measure compliance over 5-year and 10-year periods
<br>
<br>OMB shall cumulate the budgetary effects of a PAYGO Act over the budget year (which includes any look-back effects under subsection (e)) and—
<br>
<br>(1) for purposes of the 5-year scorecard referred to in subsection (d)(4), the four subsequent outyears, divide that cumulative total by five, and enter the quotient in the budget-year column and in each subsequent column of the 5-year PAYGO scorecard; and
<br>
<br>(2) for purposes of the 10-year scorecard referred to in subsection (d)(5), the nine subsequent outyears, divide that cumulative total by ten, and enter the quotient in the budget-year column and in each subsequent column of the 10-year PAYGO scorecard.
<br>(g) Emergency legislation
<br>(1) Designation in statute
<br>
<br>If a provision of direct spending or revenue legislation in a PAYGO Act is enacted as an emergency requirement that the Congress so designates in statute pursuant to this section, the amounts of new budget authority, outlays, and revenue in all fiscal years resulting from that provision shall be treated as an emergency requirement for the purposes of this Act.
<br>(2) Designation in the House of Representatives
<br>
<br>If a PAYGO Act includes a provision expressly designated as an emergency for the purposes of this chapter, the Chair shall put the question of consideration with respect thereto.
<br>(3) Point of order in the Senate
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>When the Senate is considering a PAYGO Act, if a point of order is made by a Senator against an emergency designation in that measure, that provision making such a designation shall be stricken from the measure and may not be offered as an amendment from the floor.
<br>(B) Supermajority waiver and appeals
<br>(i) Waiver
<br>
<br>Subparagraph (A) may be waived or suspended in the Senate only by an affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members, duly chosen and sworn.
<br>(ii) Appeals
<br>
<br>Appeals in the Senate from the decisions of the Chair relating to any provision of this subsection shall be limited to 1 hour, to be equally divided between, and controlled by, the appellant and the manager of the bill or joint resolution, as the case may be. An affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members of the Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall be required to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order raised under this subsection.
<br>(C) Definition of an emergency designation
<br>
<br>For purposes of subparagraph (A), a provision shall be considered an emergency designation if it designates any item as an emergency requirement pursuant to this subsection.
<br>(D) Form of the point of order
<br>
<br>A point of order under subparagraph (A) may be raised by a Senator as provided in section 644(e) of this title.
<br>(E) Conference reports
<br>
<br>When the Senate is considering a conference report on, or an amendment between the Houses in relation to, a PAYGO Act, upon a point of order being made by any Senator pursuant to this section, and such point of order being sustained, such material contained in such conference report shall be deemed stricken, and the Senate shall proceed to consider the question of whether the Senate shall recede from its amendment and concur with a further amendment, or concur in the House amendment with a further amendment, as the case may be, which further amendment shall consist of only that portion of the conference report or House amendment, as the case may be, not so stricken. Any such motion in the Senate shall be debatable. In any case in which such point of order is sustained against a conference report (or Senate amendment derived from such conference report by operation of this subsection), no further amendment shall be in order.
<br>(4) Effect of designation on scoring
<br>
<br>If a provision is designated as an emergency requirement under this Act, CBO or OMB, as applicable, shall not include the budgetary effects of such a provision in its estimate of the budgetary effects of that PAYGO legislation.

<br>§935. Calculating a sequestration
<br>(a) Reducing nonexempt budgetary resources by a uniform percentage
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>OMB shall calculate the uniform percentage by which the budgetary resources of nonexempt direct spending programs are to be sequestered such that the outlay savings resulting from that sequestration, as calculated under subsection (b), shall offset the budget-year debit, if any, on the applicable PAYGO scorecard. If the uniform percentage calculated under the prior sentence exceeds 4 percent, the Medicare programs described in section 906(d) of this title shall be reduced by 4 percent and the uniform percentage by which the budgetary resources of all other nonexempt direct spending programs are to be sequestered shall be increased, as necessary, so that the sequestration of Medicare and of all other nonexempt direct spending programs together produce the required outlay savings.
<br>(2) Programs and activities in unified budget only
<br>
<br>Subject to the exemptions set forth in section 11,1 OMB shall determine the uniform percentage required under paragraph (1) with respect to programs and activities contained in the unified budget only.
<br>(b) Outlay savings
<br>
<br>In determining the amount by which a sequestration offsets a budget-year debit, OMB shall count—
<br>
<br>(1) the amount by which the sequestration in a crop year of crop support payments, pursuant to section 906(j) of this title, reduces outlays in the budget year and the subsequent fiscal year;
<br>
<br>(2) the amount by which the sequestration of Medicare payments in the 12-month period following the sequestration order, pursuant to section 906(d) of this title, reduces outlays in the budget year and the subsequent fiscal year; and
<br>
<br>(3) the amount by which the sequestration in the budget year of the budgetary resources of other nonexempt mandatory programs reduces outlays in the budget year and in the subsequent fiscal year.

<br>§936. Adjustment for current policies
<br>(a) Purpose
<br>
<br>The purpose of this section is to provide for adjustments of estimates of budgetary effects of PAYGO legislation for legislation affecting 4 areas of the budget—
<br>
<br>(1) payments made under section 1395w–4 of title 42 (referred to in this section as "Payment for Physicians' Services");
<br>
<br>(2) the Estate and Gift Tax under subtitle B of title 26;
<br>
<br>(3) the AMT; and
<br>
<br>(4) provisions of EGTRRA or JGTRRA that amended title 26 (or provisions in later statutes further amending the amendments made by EGTRRA or JGTRRA), other than—
<br>
<br>(A) the provisions of those 2 Acts that were made permanent by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (Public Law 109–280);
<br>
<br>(B) amendments to the Estate and Gift Tax referred to in paragraph (2);
<br>
<br>(C) the AMT referred to in paragraph (3); and
<br>
<br>(D) the income tax rates on ordinary income that apply to individuals with adjusted gross incomes greater than $200,000 for a single filer and $250,000 for joint filers.
<br>(b) Duration
<br>
<br>This section shall remain in effect through December 31, 2011.
<br>(c) Medicare payments to physicians
<br>(1) Criteria
<br>
<br>Legislation that includes provisions amending or superseding the system for updating payments under subsections (d) and (f) of section 1395w–4 of title 42 shall trigger the current policy adjustment required by this chapter.
<br>(2) Adjustment
<br>
<br>The amount of the maximum current policy adjustment shall be the difference between—
<br>
<br>(A) estimated net outlays attributable to the payment rates and related parameters in accordance with subsections (d) and (f) of section 1395w–4 of title 42 (as scheduled on December 31, 2009, to be in effect); and
<br>
<br>(B) what those net outlays would have been if—
<br>
<br>(i) the nominal payment rates and related parameters in effect for 2009 had been in effect through December 31, 2014, without change; and
<br>
<br>(ii) thereafter, the nominal payment rates and related parameters described in subparagraph (A) had applied and the assumption described in clause (i) had never applied.
<br>(3) Limitation
<br>
<br>If the provisions in the legislation that cause it to meet the criteria in paragraph (1) cover a time period that ends before December 31, 2014, subject to the maximum adjustment provided for under paragraph (2), the amount of each current policy adjustment made pursuant to this section shall be limited to the difference between—
<br>
<br>(A) estimated net outlays attributable to the payment rates and related parameters specified in section 1395w–4 of title 42 (as scheduled on December 31, 2009, to be in effect for the period of time covered by the relevant provisions of the eligible legislation); and
<br>
<br>(B) what those net outlays would have been if the nominal payment rates and related parameters in effect for 2009 had been in effect, without change, for the same period of time covered by the relevant provisions of the eligible legislation as under subparagraph (A).
<br>(d) Estate and Gift Tax
<br>(1) Criteria
<br>
<br>Legislation that includes provisions amending the Estate and Gift Tax under subtitle B of title 26 shall trigger the current policy adjustment required by this chapter.
<br>(2) Adjustment
<br>
<br>The amount of the maximum current policy adjustment shall be the difference between—
<br>
<br>(A) total revenues projected to be collected under title 26 (as scheduled on December 31, 2009, to be in effect); and
<br>
<br>(B) what those revenue collections would have been if, on the date of enactment of the legislation meeting the criteria in paragraph (1), estate and gift tax law had instead been amended so that the tax rates, nominal exemption amounts, and related parameters in effect for tax year 2009 had remained in effect through December 31, 2011, with nominal exemption amounts indexed for inflation after 2009 consistent with subsection (g).
<br>(3) Limitation
<br>
<br>If the provisions in the legislation that cause it to meet the criteria in paragraph (1) cover a time period that ends before December 31, 2011, subject to the maximum adjustment provided for under paragraph (2), the amount of each current policy adjustment made pursuant to this section shall be limited to the difference between—
<br>
<br>(A) total revenues projected to be collected under title 26 (as scheduled on December 31, 2009, to be in effect for the period of time covered by the relevant provisions of the eligible legislation); and
<br>
<br>(B) what those revenues would have been if the estate and gift tax law rates, nominal exemption amounts, and related parameters in effect for 2009, with nominal exemption amounts indexed for inflation after 2009 consistent with subsection (g), had been in effect for the same period of time covered by the relevant provisions of the eligible legislation as under subparagraph (A).
<br>(4) Duration of policy adjustment
<br>
<br>Adjustments made pursuant to this subsection are available for policies affecting the estate and gift tax through only December 31, 2011. Any adjustments shall include budgetary effects in all years from these policy changes.
<br>(e) AMT relief
<br>(1) Criteria
<br>
<br>Legislation that includes provisions extending AMT relief shall trigger the current policy adjustment required by this chapter.
<br>(2) Adjustment
<br>
<br>The amount of the maximum current policy adjustment shall be the difference between—
<br>

<br>The Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>(1) Senator John C. Stennis of the State of Mississippi has served his State and country with distinction for more than 60 years as a public servant, including service in the United States Senate for a period of 41 years.
<br>
<br>(2) Senator Stennis has a distinguished record as a United States Senator, including service as the first Chairman of the Select Committee on Ethics, Chairman of the Committee on Armed Services, Chairman of the Committee on Appropriations, and President pro tempore of the Senate.
<br>
<br>(3) Senator Stennis has long maintained a special interest in and devotion to the development of leadership and excellence in public service.
<br>
<br>(4) There is a compelling need to encourage outstanding young people to pursue public service on a career basis and to provide public service leadership training opportunities for individuals serving in State and local governments and for individuals serving as employees of Members of Congress.
<br>
<br>(5) It would be a fitting tribute to Senator Stennis and to his leadership, integrity, and years of devoted public service to establish in his name a center for the training and development of leadership and excellence in public service.

<br>§1105. John C. Stennis Center for Public Service Development Trust Fund
<br>(a) Establishment of fund
<br>
<br>There is established in the Treasury of the United States a trust fund to be known as the "John C. Stennis Center for Public Service Development Trust Fund". The fund shall consist of amounts appropriated to it pursuant to section 1110 of this title and amounts credited to it under subsection (d).
<br>(b) Investment of fund assets
<br>
<br>(1) At the request of the Center, it shall be the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury to invest in full the amounts appropriated to the fund. Such investments may be made only in interest-bearing obligations of the United States issued directly to the fund.
<br>
<br>(2) The purposes for which obligations of the United States may be issued under chapter 31 of title 31 are hereby extended to authorize the issuance at par of special obligations directly to the fund. Such special obligations shall bear interest at a rate equal to the average rate of interest, computed as to the end of the calendar month next preceding the date of such issue, borne by all marketable interest-bearing obligations of the United States then forming a part of the public debt; except that where such average rate is not a multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum, the rate of interest of such special obligations shall be the multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum next lower than such average rate. All requests of the Center to the Secretary of the Treasury provided for in this section shall be binding upon the Secretary.
<br>(c) Authority to sell obligations
<br>
<br>At the request of the Center, the Secretary of the Treasury shall redeem any obligation issued directly to the fund. Obligations issued to the fund under subsection (b)(2) shall be redeemed at par plus accrued interest. Any other obligations issued directly to the fund shall be redeemed at the market price.
<br>(d) Proceeds from certain transactions credited to fund
<br>
<br>In addition to the appropriations received pursuant to section 1110 of this title, the interest on, and the proceeds from the sale or redemption of, any obligations held in the fund pursuant to section 1108(a) of this title, shall be credited to and form a part of the fund.
