<br>
<br>(1) the SBIR and STTR programs create jobs, increase capacity for technological innovation, and boost international competitiveness;
<br>
<br>(2) increasing the quantity of applications from all States to the SBIR and STTR programs would enhance competition for such awards and the quality of the completed projects; and
<br>
<br>(3) mentoring is a natural complement to the FAST program of reaching out to new companies regarding the SBIR and STTR programs as an effective and low-cost way to improve the likelihood that such companies will succeed in such programs in developing and commercializing their research.
<br>(b) Authorization for Mentoring Networks
<br>
<br>The recipient of an award or participant in a cooperative agreement under section 657d of this title may use a reasonable amount of such assistance for the establishment of a Mentoring Network under this section.

<br>
<br>(2) identify volunteer mentors who—
<br>
<br>(A) are persons associated with a small business concern that has successfully completed one or more SBIR or STTR funding agreements; and
<br>
<br>(B) have agreed to guide small business concerns through all stages of the SBIR or STTR program process, including providing assistance relating to—

<br>(5) agree to reimburse volunteer mentors for out-of-pocket expenses related to service as a mentor under this section.
<br>(d) Mentoring database
<br>
<br>The Administrator shall—
<br>
<br>(1) include in the database required by section 638(k)(1) of this title, in cooperation with the SBIR, STTR, and FAST programs, information on Mentoring Networks and mentors participating under this section, including a description of their areas of expertise;
