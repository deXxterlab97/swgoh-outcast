<br>
<br>Notwithstanding subsection (b), if an Indian tribe carries out a project or activity funded by a Federal agency, the Indian tribe shall have the authority to rely on the environmental review process of the applicable Federal agency, rather than any tribal environmental review process under this section.
<br>(f) Documentation
<br>
<br>If an Indian tribe executes a surface leasing transaction or forest land management activity, pursuant to tribal regulations under subsection (b)(2), the Indian tribe shall provide to the Secretary 2
<br>
<br>(1) a copy of the surface leasing transaction or forest land management activity documents, including any amendments to, or renewals of, the applicable transaction; and
<br>
<br>(2) in the case of tribal regulations, a surface leasing transaction, or forest land management activities that allow payments to be made directly to the Indian tribe, documentation of the payments that is sufficient to enable the Secretary to discharge the trust responsibility of the United States under subsection (g).

<br>
<br>If the Secretary determines under paragraph (1) that a violation of tribal regulations has occurred, the Secretary may take any action the Secretary determines to be necessary to remedy the violation, including rescinding the approval of the tribal regulations and reassuming responsibility for the approval of leases of tribal trust land.

<br>(A) make a written determination with respect to the regulations that have been violated;
<br>
<br>(B) provide to the applicable Indian tribe a written notice of the alleged violation, together with the written determination; and

<br>(1) entrepreneurs face specific challenges when transforming ideas into profitable business enterprises;
<br>
<br>(2) entrepreneurs that want to provide products and services in reservation communities face an additional set of challenges that requires special knowledge;

<br>
<br>(B) access to capital, business education, and counseling;
<br>
