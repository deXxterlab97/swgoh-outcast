<br>§2089. All-terrain vehicles
<br>(a) In general
<br>(1) Mandatory standard
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, within 90 days after August 14, 2008, the Commission shall publish in the Federal Register as a mandatory consumer product safety standard the American National Standard for Four Wheel All-Terrain Vehicles Equipment Configuration, and Performance Requirements developed by the Specialty Vehicle Institute of America (American National Standard ANSI/SVIA–1–2007). The standard shall take effect 150 days after it is published.
<br>(2) Compliance with standard
<br>
<br>After the standard takes effect, it shall be unlawful for any manufacturer or distributor to import into or distribute in commerce in the United States any new assembled or unassembled all-terrain vehicle unless—
<br>
<br>(A) the all-terrain vehicle complies with each applicable provision of the standard;
<br>
<br>(B) the ATV is subject to an ATV action plan filed with the Commission before August 14, 2008, or subsequently filed with and approved by the Commission, and bears a label certifying such compliance and identifying the manufacturer, importer or private labeler and the ATV action plan to which it is subject; and
<br>
<br>(C) the manufacturer or distributor is in compliance with all provisions of the applicable ATV action plan.
<br>(3) Violation
<br>
<br>The failure to comply with any requirement of paragraph (2) shall be deemed to be a failure to comply with a consumer product safety standard under this chapter and subject to all of the penalties and remedies available under this chapter.
<br>(4) Compliant models with additional features
<br>
<br>Paragraph (2) shall not be construed to prohibit the distribution in commerce of new all-terrain vehicles that comply with the requirements of that paragraph but also incorporate characteristics or components that are not covered by those requirements. Any such characteristics or components shall be subject to the requirements of section 2064 of this title.
<br>(b) Modification of standard
<br>(1) ANSI revisions
<br>
<br>If the American National Standard ANSI/SVIA–1–2007 is revised through the applicable consensus standards development process after the date on which the product safety standard for all-terrain vehicles is published in the Federal Register, the American National Standards Institute shall notify the Commission of the revision.
<br>(2) Commission action
<br>
<br>Within 120 days after it receives notice of such a revision by the American National Standards Institute, the Commission shall issue a notice of proposed rulemaking in accordance with section 553 of title 5 to amend the product safety standard for all-terrain vehicles to include any such revision that the Commission determines is reasonably related to the safe performance of all-terrain vehicles, and notify the Institute of any provision it has determined not to be so related. The Commission shall promulgate an amendment to the standard for all-terrain vehicles within 180 days after the date on which the notice of proposed rulemaking for the amendment is published in the Federal Register.
<br>(3) Unreasonable risk of injury
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the Commission may, pursuant to sections 2056 and 2058 of this title, amend the product safety standard for all-terrain vehicles to include any additional provision that the Commission determines is reasonably necessary to reduce an unreasonable risk of injury associated with the performance of all-terrain vehicles.
<br>(4) Certain provisions not applicable
<br>
<br>Sections 2056 and 2058 of this title shall not apply to promulgation of any amendment of the product safety standard under paragraph (2). Judicial review of any amendment of the standard under paragraph (2) shall be in accordance with chapter 7 of title 5.
<br>(c) Requirements for 3-wheeled all-terrain vehicles
<br>
<br>Until a mandatory consumer product safety standard applicable to 3-wheeled all-terrain vehicles promulgated pursuant to this chapter is in effect, new 3-wheeled all-terrain vehicles may not be imported into or distributed in commerce in the United States. Any violation of this subsection shall be considered to be a violation of section 2068(a)(1) of this title and may also be enforced under section 2066 of this title.
<br>(d) Further proceedings
<br>(1) Deadline
<br>
<br>The Commission shall issue a final rule in its proceeding entitled "Standards for All Terrain Vehicles and Ban of Three-wheeled All Terrain Vehicles".
<br>(2) Categories of youth ATVs
<br>
<br>In the final rule, the Commission, in consultation with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, may provide for a multiple factor method of categorization that, at a minimum, takes into account—
<br>
<br>(A) the weight of the ATV;
<br>
<br>(B) the maximum speed of the ATV;
<br>
<br>(C) the velocity at which an ATV of a given weight is traveling at the maximum speed of the ATV;
<br>
<br>(D) the age of children for whose operation the ATV is designed or who may reasonably be expected to operate the ATV; and
<br>
<br>(E) the average weight of children for whose operation the ATV is designed or who may reasonably be expected to operate the ATV.
<br>(3) Additional safety standards
<br>
<br>In the final rule, the Commission, in consultation with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, shall review the standard published under subsection (a)(1) and establish additional safety standards for all-terrain vehicles to the extent necessary to protect the public health and safety. As part of its review, the Commission shall consider, at a minimum, establishing or strengthening standards on—
<br>
<br>(A) suspension;
<br>
<br>(B) brake performance;
<br>
<br>(C) speed governors;
<br>
<br>(D) warning labels;
<br>
<br>(E) marketing; and
<br>
<br>(F) dynamic stability.

<br>§2201. Congressional findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) The National Commission on Fire Prevention and Control, established pursuant to Public Law 90–259, has made an exhaustive and comprehensive examination of the Nation's fire problem, has made detailed findings as to the extent of this problem in terms of human suffering and loss of life and property, and has made ninety thoughtful recommendations.
<br>
<br>(2) The United States today has the highest per capita rate of death and property loss from fire of all the major industrialized nations in the world.
<br>
<br>(3) Fire is an undue burden affecting all Americans, and fire also constitutes a public health and safety problem of great dimensions. Fire kills 12,000 and scars and injures 300,000 Americans each year, including 50,000 individuals who require extended hospitalization. Almost $3 billion worth of property is destroyed annually by fire, and the total economic cost of destructive fire in the United States is estimated conservatively to be $11,000,000,000 per year. Firefighting is the Nation's most hazardous profession.
<br>
<br>(4) Such losses of life and property from fire are unacceptable to the Congress.
<br>
<br>(5) While fire prevention and control is and should remain a State and local responsibility, the Federal Government must help if a significant reduction in fire losses is to be achieved.
<br>
<br>(6) The fire service and the civil defense program in each locality would both benefit from closer cooperation.
<br>
<br>(7) The Nation's fire problem is exacerbated by (A) the indifference with which some Americans confront the subject; (B) the Nation's failure to undertake enough research and development into fire and fire-related problems; (C) the scarcity of reliable data and information; (D) the fact that designers and purchasers of buildings and products generally give insufficient attention to fire safety; (E) the fact that many communities lack adequate building and fire prevention codes; and (F) the fact that local fire departments spend about 95 cents of every dollar appropriated to the fire services on efforts to extinguish fires and only about 5 cents on fire prevention.
<br>
<br>(8) There is a need for improved professional training and education oriented toward improving the effectiveness of the fire services, including an increased emphasis on preventing fires and on reducing injuries to firefighters.
<br>
<br>(9) A national system for the collection, analysis, and dissemination of fire data is needed to help local fire services establish research and action priorities.
<br>
<br>(10) The number of specialized medical centers which are properly equipped and staffed for the treatment of burns and the rehabilitation of victims of fires is inadequate.
<br>
<br>(11) The unacceptably high rates of death, injury, and property loss from fire can be reduced if the Federal Government establishes a coordinated program to support and reinforce the fire prevention and control activities of State and local governments.

<br>
<br>"(1) arson is a serious and costly problem, and is responsible for approximately 25 percent of all fires in the United States;
<br>
<br>"(2) arson is a leading cause of fire deaths, accounting for approximately 700 deaths annually in the United States, and is the leading cause of property damage due to fire in the United States;
<br>
<br>"(3) estimates of arson property losses are in the range of $2,000,000,000 annually, or approximately 1 of every 4 dollars lost to fire;
<br>
<br>"(4) the incidence of arson in the United States is seriously underreported, in part because of the lack of adequate participation by local jurisdictions in the National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS) and the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program;
<br>
<br>"(5) there is a need for expanded training programs for arson investigators;
<br>
<br>"(6) there is a need for improved programs designed to enable volunteer firefighters to detect arson crimes and to preserve evidence vital to the investigation and prosecution of arson cases;
<br>
<br>"(7) according to the National Fire Protection Association, of all the suspicious and incendiary fires estimated to occur, only 1/3 are confirmed as arson; and
<br>
<br>"(8) improved training of arson investigators will increase the ability of fire departments to identify suspicious and incendiary fires, and will result in increased and more effective prosecution of arson offenses."
<br>Congressional Findings and Purpose
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 110–376, §2, Oct. 8, 2008, 122 Stat. 4056, provided that: "Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>"(1) The number of lives lost each year because of fire has dropped significantly over the last 25 years in the United States. However, the United States still has one of the highest fire death rates in the industrialized world. In 2006, the National Fire Protection Association reported 3,245 civilian fire deaths, 16,400 civilian fire injuries, and $11,307,000,000 in direct losses due to fire.
<br>
<br>"(2) Every year, more than 100 firefighters die in the line of duty. The United States Fire Administration should continue its leadership to help local fire agencies dramatically reduce these fatalities.
<br>
<br>"(3) The Federal Government should continue to work with State and local governments and the fire service community to further the promotion of national voluntary consensus standards that increase firefighter safety.
<br>
<br>"(4) The United States Fire Administration provides crucial support to the 30,300 fire departments of the United States through training, emergency incident data collection, fire awareness and education, and support of research and development activities for fire prevention, control, and suppression technologies.
<br>
<br>"(5) The collection of data on fire and other emergency incidents is a vital tool both for policy makers and emergency responders to identify and develop responses to emerging hazards. Improving the data collection capabilities of the United States Fire Administration is essential for accurately tracking and responding to the magnitude and nature of the fire problems of the United States.
<br>
<br>"(6) The research and development performed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the United States Fire Administration, other government agencies, and nongovernmental organizations on fire technologies, techniques, and tools advance the capabilities of the fire service of the United States to suppress and prevent fires.
<br>
<br>"(7) Because of the essential role of the United States Fire Administration and the fire service community in preparing for and responding to national [probably should be "natural"] and man-made disasters, the United States Fire Administration should have a prominent place within the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Homeland Security."

<br>"(a) Findings.—Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>"(1) more than 400 Americans have lost their lives in multistory hotel fires over the last 5 years;
<br>
<br>"(2) when properly installed and maintained, automatic sprinklers and smoke detectors provide the most effective safeguards against the loss of life and property from fire;
<br>
<br>"(3) automatic sprinklers and smoke detectors should supplement and not supplant other fire protection measures, including existing requirements for fire resistive walls and fire retardant furnishings;
<br>
<br>"(4) some State and local governments and the hotel industry need to act more rapidly to require the installation and use of automatic sprinkler systems in hotels; and
<br>
<br>"(5) through the United States Fire Administration and the Center for Fire Research, the Federal Government has helped to develop and promote the use of residential sprinkler systems and other means of fire prevention and control.
<br>
<br>"(b) Purpose.—It is the purpose of this Act [see Short Title of 1990 Amendment note above] to save lives and protect property by promoting fire and life safety in hotels, motels, and all places of public accommodation affecting commerce."

<br>
<br>[Pursuant to Ex. Ord. 12127, Mar. 31, 1979, 44 F.R. 19367, this Reorg. Plan is effective Apr. 1, 1979]
<br>Message of the President
<br>
<br>To the Congress of the United States:
<br>
<br>Today I am transmitting Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1978. The plan improves Federal emergency management and assistance. By consolidating emergency preparedness, mitigation and response activities, it cuts duplicative administrative costs and strengthens our ability to deal effectively with emergencies.
<br>
<br>The plan, together with changes I will make through Executive action, would merge five agencies from the Departments of Defense, Commerce, HUD, and GSA into one new agency.
<br>
<br>For the first time, key emergency management and assistance functions would be unified and made directly accountable to the President and Congress. This will reduce pressures for increased costs to serve similar goals.
<br>
<br>The present situation has severely hampered Federal support of State and local emergency organizations and resources, which bear the primary responsibility for preserving life and property in times of calamity. This reorganization has been developed in close cooperation with State and local governments.
<br>
<br>If approved by the Congress, the plan will establish the Federal Emergency Management Agency, whose Director shall report directly to the President. The National Fire Prevention and Control Administration (in the Department of Commerce), the Federal Insurance Administration (in the Department of Housing and Urban Development), and oversight responsibility for the Federal Emergency Broadcast System (now assigned in the Executive Office of the President) would be transferred to the Agency. The Agency's Director, its Deputy Director, and its five principal program managers would be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate.
<br>
<br>If the plan takes effect, I will assign to the Federal Emergency Management Agency all authorities and functions vested by law in the President and presently delegated to the Defense Civil Preparedness Agency (in the Department of Defense). This will include certain engineering and communications support functions for civil defense now assigned to the U.S. Army.
<br>
<br>I will also transfer to the new Agency all authorities and functions under the Disaster Relief Acts of 1970 and 1974 [sections 4401 et seq. and 5121 et seq. of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare] now delegated to the Federal Disaster Assistance Administration in the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
<br>
<br>I will also transfer all Presidential authorities and functions now delegated to the Federal Preparedness Agency in the General Services Administration, including the establishment of policy for the national stockpile. The stockpile disposal function, which is statutorily assigned to the General Services Administration, would remain there. Once these steps have been taken by Executive Order, these three agencies would be abolished.
<br>
<br>Several additional transfers of emergency preparedness and mitigation functions would complete the consolidation. These include:
<br>
<br>Oversight of the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program, under Public Law 95–124 [section 7701 et seq. of Title 42], now carried out by the Office of Science and Technology Policy in the Executive Office of the President.
<br>
<br>Coordination of Federal activities to promote dam safety, carried by the same Office.
<br>
<br>Responsibility for assistance to communities in the development of readiness plans for severe weather-related emergencies, including floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes.
<br>
<br>Coordination of natural and nuclear disaster warning systems.
<br>
<br>Coordination of preparedness and planning to reduce the consequences of major terrorist incidents. This would not alter the present responsibility of the executive branch for reacting to the incidents themselves.
<br>
<br>This reorganization rests on several fundamental principles:
<br>
<br>First, Federal authorities to anticipate, prepare for, and respond to major civil emergencies should be supervised by one official responsible to the President and given attention by other officials at the highest levels.
<br>
<br>The new Agency would be in this position. To increase White House oversight and involvement still further, I shall establish by Executive Order an Emergency Management Committee, to be chaired by the Federal Emergency Management Agency Director. Its membership shall be comprised of the Assistants to the President for National Security, Domestic Affairs and Policy and Intergovernmental Relations, and the Director, Office of Management and Budget. It will advise the President on ways to meet national civil emergencies. It will also oversee and provide guidance on the management of all Federal emergency authorities, advising the President on alternative approaches to improve performance and avoid excessive costs.
<br>
<br>Second, an effective civil defense system requires the most efficient use of all available emergency resources. At the same time, civil defense systems, organization, and resources must be prepared to cope with any disasters which threaten our people. The Congress has clearly recognized this principle in recent changes in the civil defense legislation.
<br>
<br>The communications, warning, evacuation, and public education processes involved in preparedness for a possible nuclear attack should be developed, tested, and used for major natural and accidental disasters as well. Consolidation of civil defense functions in the new Agency will assure that attack readiness programs are effectively integrated into the preparedness organizations and programs of State and local government, private industry, and volunteer organizations.
<br>
<br>While serving an important "all hazards" readiness and response role, civil defense must continue to be fully compatible with and be ready to play an important role in our Nation's overall strategic policy. Accordingly, to maintain a link between our strategic nuclear planning and our nuclear attack preparedness planning, I will make the Secretary of Defense and the National Security Council responsible for oversight of civil defense related programs and policies of the new Agency. This will also include appropriate Department of Defense support in areas like program development, technical support, research, communications, intelligence and emergency operations.
<br>
<br>Third, whenever possible, emergency responsibilities should be extensions of the regular missions of Federal agencies. The primary task of the Federal Emergency Management Agency will be to coordinate and plan for the emergency deployment of resources that have other routine uses. There is no need to develop a separate set of Federal skills and capabilities for those rare occasions when catastrophe occurs.
<br>
<br>Fourth, Federal hazard mitigation activities should be closely linked with emergency preparedness and response functions. This reorganization would permit more rational decisions on the relative costs and benefits of alternative approaches to disasters by making the Federal Emergency Management Agency the focal point of all Federal hazard mitigation activities and by combining these with the key Federal preparedness and response functions.
<br>
<br>The affected hazard mitigation activities include the Federal Insurance Administration which seeks to reduce flood losses by assisting states and local governments in developing appropriate land uses and building standards and several agencies that presently seek to reduce fire and earthquake losses through research and education.
<br>
<br>Most State and local governments have consolidated emergency planning, preparedness and response functions on an "all hazard" basis to take advantage of the similarities in preparing for and responding to the full range of potential emergencies. The Federal Government can and should follow this lead.
<br>
<br>Each of the changes set forth in the plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 901(a) of title 5 of the United States Code. The plan does not call for abolishing any functions now authorized by law. The provisions in the plan for the appointment and pay of any head or officer of the new agency have been found by me to be necessary.
<br>
<br>I do not expect these actions to result in any significant changes in program expenditures for those authorities to be transferred. However, cost savings of between $10 to $15 million annually can be achieved by consolidating headquarters and regional facilities and staffs. The elimination (through attrition) of about 300 jobs is also anticipated.
<br>
<br>The emergency planning and response authorities involved in this plan are vitally important to the security and well-being of our Nation. I urge the Congress to approve it.

<br>
<br>1–101. Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1978 (43 FR 41943), which establishes the Federal Emergency Management Agency, provides for the transfer of functions, and the transfer and abolition of agencies and offices, is hereby effective.
<br>
<br>1–102. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall, in accord with Section 302 of the Reorganization Plan, provide for all the appropriate transfers, including those transfers related to all the functions transferred from the Department of Commerce, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the President.
<br>
<br>1–103. (a) The functions transferred from the Department of Commerce are those vested in the Secretary of Commerce, the Administrator and Deputy Administrator of the National Fire Prevention and Control Administration (now the United States Fire Administration (Sec. 2(a) of Public Law 95–422)), and the Superintendent of the National Academy for Fire Prevention and Control pursuant to the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974, as amended (15 U.S.C. 2201 et seq.)
