The Secretary shall cause such revisions to be published in the Federal Register.
<br>(3) Tribal resolution determination
<br>
<br>Nothing in this section shall deny a tribal governing body the authority, on a continuing basis, to adopt a tribal resolution allowing parents the choice of the Bureau-funded school their children may attend, regardless of the attendance boundaries established under this section.
<br>(d) Funding restrictions
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall not deny funding to a Bureau-funded school for any eligible Indian student attending the school solely because that student's home or domicile is outside of the geographical attendance area established for that school under this section.
<br>(2) Transportation
<br>
<br>No funding shall be made available without tribal authorization to enable a school to provide transportation for any student to or from the school and a location outside the approved attendance area of the school.
<br>(e) Reservation as boundary
<br>
<br>When there is only one Bureau-funded program located on an Indian reservation—
<br>
<br>(1) the attendance area for the program shall be the boundaries (established by treaty, agreement, legislation, court decisions, or executive decisions and as accepted by the tribe) of the reservation served; and
<br>
<br>(2) those students residing near the reservation shall also receive services from such program.
<br>(f) Off-reservation home-living (dormitory) schools
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any geographical attendance areas, attendance at off-reservation home-living (dormitory) schools shall include students requiring special emphasis programs to be implemented at each off-reservation home-living (dormitory) school.

<br>Effective Date
<br>
<br>Section effective Jan. 8, 2002, except with respect to certain noncompetitive programs and competitive programs, see section 5 of Pub. L. 107–110, set out as a note under section 6301 of Title 20, Education.
<br>§2007. Allotment formula
<br>(a) Factors considered; revision to reflect standards
<br>(1) Formula
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall establish, by regulation adopted in accordance with section 2017 of this title, a formula for determining the minimum annual amount of funds necessary to sustain each Bureau-funded school. In establishing such formula, the Secretary shall consider—
<br>
<br>(A) the number of eligible Indian students served and total student population of the school;
<br>
<br>(B) special cost factors, such as—
<br>
<br>(i) the isolation of the school;
<br>
<br>(ii) the need for special staffing, transportation, or educational programs;
<br>
<br>(iii) food and housing costs;
<br>
<br>(iv) maintenance and repair costs associated with the physical condition of the educational facilities;
<br>
<br>(v) special transportation and other costs of isolated and small schools;
<br>
<br>(vi) the costs of home-living (dormitory) arrangements, where determined necessary by a tribal governing body or designated school board;
<br>
<br>(vii) costs associated with greater lengths of service by education personnel;
<br>
<br>(viii) the costs of therapeutic programs for students requiring such programs; and
<br>
<br>(ix) special costs for gifted and talented students;
<br>
<br>(C) the cost of providing academic services which are at least equivalent to those provided by public schools in the State in which the school is located;
<br>
<br>(D) whether the available funding will enable the school involved to comply with the accreditation standards applicable to the school under section 2001 of this title; and
<br>
<br>(E) such other relevant factors as the Secretary determines are appropriate.
<br>(2) Revision of formula
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Upon the establishment of the standards required in section 2002 of this title, the Secretary shall revise the formula established under this subsection to reflect the cost of funding such standards.
<br>(B) Review of formula
<br>
<br>Not later than January 1, 2003, the Secretary shall review the formula established under this section and shall take such steps as are necessary to increase the availability of counseling and therapeutic programs for students in off-reservation home-living (dormitory) schools and other Bureau-operated residential facilities.
<br>(C) Review of standards
<br>
<br>Concurrent with such action, the Secretary shall review the standards established under section 2002 of this title to be certain that adequate provision is made for parental notification regarding, and consent for, such counseling and therapeutic programs.
<br>(b) Pro rata allotment
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, Federal funds appropriated for the general local operation of Bureau-funded schools shall be allotted pro rata in accordance with the formula established under subsection (a).
<br>(c) Annual adjustment; reservation of amount for school board activities
<br>(1) Annual adjustment
<br>
<br>For fiscal year 2003, and for each subsequent fiscal year, the Secretary shall adjust the formula established under subsection (a) to ensure that the formula does the following:
<br>
<br>(A) Uses a weighted unit of 1.2 for each eligible Indian student enrolled in the seventh and eighth grades of the school in considering the number of eligible Indian students served by the school.
<br>
<br>(B) Considers a school with an enrollment of less than 50 eligible Indian students as having an average daily attendance of 50 eligible Indian students for purposes of implementing the adjustment factor for small schools.
<br>
<br>(C) Takes into account the provision of residential services on less than a 9-month basis at a school when the school board and supervisor of the school determine that a less than 9-month basis will be implemented for the school year involved.
<br>
<br>(D) Uses a weighted unit of 2.0 for each eligible Indian student that—
<br>
<br>(i) is gifted and talented; and
<br>
<br>(ii) is enrolled in the school on a full-time basis,
<br>
<br>in considering the number of eligible Indian students served by the school.
<br>
<br>(E) Uses a weighted unit of 0.25 for each eligible Indian student who is enrolled in a year-long credit course in an Indian or Native language as part of the regular curriculum of a school, in considering the number of eligible Indian students served by such school. The adjustment required under this subparagraph shall be used for such school after—
<br>
<br>(i) the certification of the Indian or Native language curriculum by the school board of such school to the Secretary, together with an estimate of the number of full-time students expected to be enrolled in the curriculum in the second school year for which the certification is made; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the funds appropriated for allotment under this section are designated by the appropriations Act appropriating such funds as the amount necessary to implement such adjustment at such school without reducing allotments made under this section to any school by virtue of such adjustment.
<br>(2) Reservation of amount
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>From the funds allotted in accordance with the formula established under subsection (a) for each Bureau school, the local school board of such school may reserve an amount which does not exceed the greater of—
<br>
<br>(i) $8,000; or
<br>
<br>(ii) the lesser of—
<br>
<br>(I) $15,000; or
<br>
<br>(II) 1 percent of such allotted funds,
<br>
<br>for school board activities for such school, including (notwithstanding any other provision of law) meeting expenses and the cost of membership in, and support of, organizations engaged in activities on behalf of Indian education.
<br>(B) Training
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>Each local school board, and any agency school board that serves as a local school board for any grant or contract school, shall ensure that each individual who is a new member of the school board receives, within 1 year after the individual becomes a member of the school board, 40 hours of training relevant to that individual's service on the board.
<br>(ii) Types of training
<br>
<br>Such training may include training concerning legal issues pertaining to Bureau-funded schools, legal issues pertaining to school boards, ethics, and other topics determined to be appropriate by the school board.
<br>(iii) Recommendation
<br>
<br>The training described in this subparagraph shall not be required, but is recommended, for a tribal governing body that serves in the capacity of a school board.
<br>(d) Reservation of amount for emergencies
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall reserve from the funds available for distribution for each fiscal year under this section an amount that, in the aggregate, equals 1 percent of the funds available for such purpose for that fiscal year, to be used, at the discretion of the Director of the Office of Indian Education Programs, to meet emergencies and unforeseen contingencies affecting the education programs funded under this section.
<br>(2) Use of funds
<br>
<br>Funds reserved under this subsection may be expended only for education services or programs, including emergency repairs of educational facilities, at a schoolsite (as defined by section 2503(c)(2) 1 of this title).
<br>(3) Availability of funds
<br>
<br>Funds reserved under this subsection shall remain available without fiscal year limitation until expended. However, the aggregate amount available from all fiscal years may not exceed 1 percent of the current year funds.
<br>(4) Report
<br>
<br>When the Secretary makes funds available under this subsection, the Secretary shall report such action to the appropriate committees of Congress within the annual budget submission.
<br>(e) Supplemental appropriations
<br>
<br>Supplemental appropriations enacted to meet increased pay costs attributable to school level personnel shall be distributed under this section.
<br>(f) Eligible Indian student defined
<br>
<br>In this section, the term "eligible Indian student" means a student who—
<br>
<br>(1) is a member of, or is at least one-fourth degree Indian blood descendant of a member of, a tribe that is eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States through the Bureau to Indians because of their status as Indians;
<br>
<br>(2) resides on or near a reservation or meets the criteria for attendance at a Bureau off-reservation home-living school; and
<br>
<br>(3) is enrolled in a Bureau-funded school.

<br>(ii) which are administered for the benefit of Indians through Bureau schools; and
<br>
<br>(C) all operation, maintenance, and repair funds for facilities and Government quarters used in the operation or support of elementary and secondary education functions for the benefit of Indians, from whatever source derived.
<br>(3) Direct cost base
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (B), the direct cost base of a tribe or tribal organization for the fiscal year is the aggregate direct cost program funding for all tribal elementary or secondary educational programs operated by the tribe or tribal organization during—
<br>
<br>(i) the second fiscal year preceding such fiscal year; or
<br>
<br>(ii) if such programs have not been operated by the tribe or tribal organization during the 2 preceding fiscal years, the first fiscal year preceding such fiscal year.
<br>(B) Functions not previously operated
<br>
<br>In the case of Bureau elementary or secondary education functions which have not previously been operated by a tribe or tribal organization under contract, grant, or agreement with the Bureau, the direct cost base for the initial year shall be the projected aggregate direct cost program funding for all Bureau elementary and secondary functions to be operated by the tribe or tribal organization during that fiscal year.

<br>(b) Grants; effect upon appropriated amounts
<br>(1) Grants
<br>
<br>Subject to the availability of funds, the Secretary shall provide grants to each tribe or tribal organization operating a contract school or grant school in the amount determined under this section with respect to the tribe or tribal organization for the purpose of paying the administrative and indirect costs incurred in operating contract or grant schools, provided that no school operated as a stand-alone institution shall receive less than $200,000 per year for these purposes, in order to—
<br>
<br>(A) enable tribes and tribal organizations operating such schools, without reducing direct program services to the beneficiaries of the program, to provide all related administrative overhead services and operations necessary to meet the requirements of law and prudent management practice; and
<br>
<br>(B) carry out other necessary support functions which would otherwise be provided by the Secretary or other Federal officers or employees, from resources other than direct program funds, in support of comparable Bureau-operated programs.
<br>(2) Effect upon appropriated amounts
<br>
<br>Amounts appropriated to fund the grants provided under this section shall be in addition to, and shall not reduce, the amounts appropriated for the program being administered by the contract or grant school.
<br>(c) Determination of grant amount
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The amount of the grant provided to each tribe or tribal organization under this section for each fiscal year shall be determined by applying the administrative cost percentage rate of the tribe or tribal organization to the aggregate of the Bureau elementary and secondary functions operated by the tribe or tribal organization for which funds are received from or through the Bureau.
<br>(2) Direct cost base funds
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall—
<br>
<br>(A) reduce the amount of the grant determined under paragraph (1) to the extent that payments for administrative costs are actually received by an Indian tribe or tribal organization under any Federal education program included in the direct cost base of the tribe or tribal organization; and
<br>
<br>(B) take such actions as may be necessary to be reimbursed by any other department or agency of the Federal Government for the portion of grants made under this section for the costs of administering any program for Indians that is funded by appropriations made to such other department or agency.
<br>(d) Administrative cost percentage rate
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, the administrative cost percentage rate for a contract or grant school for a fiscal year is equal to the percentage determined by dividing—
<br>
<br>(A) the sum of—
<br>
<br>(i) the amount equal to—
<br>
<br>(I) the direct cost base of the tribe or tribal organization for the fiscal year, multiplied by
<br>
<br>(II) the minimum base rate; plus
<br>
<br>(ii) the amount equal to—
<br>
<br>(I) the standard direct cost base; multiplied by
<br>
<br>(II) the maximum base rate; by
<br>
<br>(B) the sum of—
<br>
<br>(i) the direct cost base of the tribe or tribal organization for the fiscal year; plus
<br>
<br>(ii) the standard direct cost base.
<br>(2) Rounding
<br>
<br>The administrative cost percentage rate shall be determined to the 1/100 of a decimal point.
<br>(3) Applicability
<br>
<br>The administrative cost percentage rate determined under this subsection shall not apply to other programs operated by the tribe or tribal organization.
<br>(e) Combining funds
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Funds received by a tribe or contract or grant school as grants under this section for tribal elementary or secondary educational programs may be combined by the tribe or contract or grant school into a single administrative cost account without the necessity of maintaining separate funding source accounting.
<br>(2) Indirect cost funds
<br>
<br>Indirect cost funds for programs at the school which share common administrative services with tribal elementary or secondary educational programs may be included in the administrative cost account described in paragraph (1).
<br>(f) Availability of funds
<br>
<br>Funds received as grants under this section with respect to tribal elementary or secondary education programs shall remain available to the contract or grant school without fiscal year limitation and without diminishing the amount of any grants otherwise payable to the school under this section for any fiscal year beginning after the fiscal year for which the grant is provided.
<br>(g) Treatment of funds
<br>
<br>Funds received as grants under this section for Bureau-funded programs operated by a tribe or tribal organization under a contract or agreement shall not be taken into consideration for purposes of indirect cost underrecovery and overrecovery determinations by any Federal agency for any other funds, from whatever source derived.
<br>(h) Treatment of entity operating other programs
<br>
<br>In applying this section and section 106 of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act [25 U.S.C. 5325] with respect to an Indian tribe or tribal organization that—
<br>
<br>(1) receives funds under this section for administrative costs incurred in operating a contract or grant school or a school operated under the Tribally Controlled Schools Act of 1988 [25 U.S.C. 2501 et seq.]; and
<br>
<br>(2) operates one or more other programs under a contract or grant provided under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act [25 U.S.C. 5301 et seq.],
<br>
<br>the Secretary shall ensure that the Indian tribe or tribal organization is provided with the full amount of the administrative costs that are associated with operating the contract or grant school, and of the indirect costs, that are associated with all of such other programs, except that funds appropriated for implementation of this section shall be used only to supply the amount of the grant required to be provided by this section.
<br>(i) Studies for determination of factors affecting costs; base rates limits; standard direct cost base; report to Congress
<br>(1) Studies
<br>
<br>Not later than 120 days after January 8, 2002, the Director of the Office of Indian Education Programs shall—
<br>
<br>(A) conduct such studies as may be needed to establish an empirical basis for determining relevant factors substantially affecting required administrative costs of tribal elementary and secondary education programs, using the formula set forth in subsection (c); and
<br>
<br>(B) conduct a study to determine—
<br>
<br>(i) a maximum base rate which ensures that the amount of the grants provided under this section will provide adequate (but not excessive) funding of the administrative costs of the smallest tribal elementary or secondary educational programs;
<br>
<br>(ii) a minimum base rate which ensures that the amount of the grants provided under this section will provide adequate (but not excessive) funding of the administrative costs of the largest tribal elementary or secondary educational programs; and
<br>
<br>(iii) a standard direct cost base which is the aggregate direct cost funding level for which the percentage determined under subsection (d) will—
<br>
<br>(I) be equal to the median between the maximum base rate and the minimum base rate; and
<br>
<br>(II) ensure that the amount of the grants provided under this section will provide adequate (but not excessive) funding of the administrative costs of tribal elementary or secondary educational programs closest to the size of the program.
<br>(2) Guidelines
<br>
<br>The studies required under paragraph (1) shall—
<br>
<br>(A) be conducted in full consultation (in accordance with section 2011 of this title) with—
<br>
<br>(i) the tribes and tribal organizations that are affected by the application of the formula set forth in subsection (c); and
<br>
<br>(ii) all national and regional Indian organizations of which such tribes and tribal organizations are typically members;
<br>
<br>(B) be conducted onsite with a representative statistical sample of the tribal elementary or secondary educational programs under a contract entered into with a nationally reputable public accounting and business consulting firm;
<br>
<br>(C) take into account the availability of skilled labor commodities, business and automatic data processing services, related Indian preference and Indian control of education requirements, and any other market factors found to substantially affect the administrative costs and efficiency of each such tribal elementary or secondary educational program studied in order to ensure that all required administrative activities can reasonably be delivered in a cost effective manner for each such program, given an administrative cost allowance generated by the values, percentages, or other factors found in the studies to be relevant in such formula;
<br>
<br>(D) identify, and quantify in terms of percentages of direct program costs, any general factors arising from geographic isolation, or numbers of programs administered, independent of program size factors used to compute a base administrative cost percentage in such formula; and
<br>
<br>(E) identify any other incremental cost factors substantially affecting the costs of required administrative cost functions at any of the tribal elementary or secondary educational programs studied and determine whether the factors are of general applicability to other such programs, and (if so) how the factors may effectively be incorporated into such formula.
<br>(3) Consultation with Inspector General
<br>
<br>In carrying out the studies required under this subsection, the Director shall obtain the input of, and afford an opportunity to participate to, the Inspector General of the Department of the Interior.
<br>(4) Consideration of delivery of administrative services
