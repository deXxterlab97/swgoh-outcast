<br>
<br>(5) The administration of medications and treatment methods to covered horses should be based upon an examination and diagnosis that identifies an issue requiring treatment for which the medication or method represents an appropriate component of treatment.
<br>
<br>(6) The amount of therapeutic medication that a covered horse receives should be the minimum necessary to address the diagnosed health concerns identified during the examination and diagnostic process.
<br>
<br>(7) The welfare of covered horses, the integrity of the sport, and the confidence of the betting public require full disclosure to regulatory authorities regarding the administration of medications and treatments to covered horses.

<br>§3101. Congressional findings
<br>
<br>(a) The Congress finds that the Nation has suffered substantial unemployment and underemployment, idleness of other productive resources, high rates of inflation, and inadequate productivity growth, over prolonged periods of time, imposing numerous economic and social costs on the Nation. Such costs include the following:
<br>
<br>(1) The Nation is deprived of the full supply of goods and services, the full utilization of labor and capital resources, and the related increases in economic well-being that would occur under conditions of genuine full employment, production, and real income, balanced growth, a balanced Federal budget, and the effective control of inflation.
<br>
<br>(2) The output of goods and services is insufficient to meet pressing national priorities.
<br>
<br>(3) Workers are deprived of the job security, income, skill development, and productivity necessary to maintain and advance their standards of living.
<br>
<br>(4) Business and industry are deprived of the production, sales, capital flow, and productivity necessary to maintain adequate profits, undertake new investment, create jobs, compete internationally, and contribute to meeting society's economic needs. These problems are especially acute for smaller businesses. Variations in the business cycle and low-level operations of the economy are far more damaging to smaller businesses than to larger business concerns because smaller businesses have fewer available resources, and less access to resources, to withstand nationwide economic adversity. A decline in small business enterprises contributes to unemployment by reducing employment opportunities and contributes to inflation by reducing competition.
<br>
<br>(5) Unemployment exposes many families to social, psychological, and physiological costs, including disruption of family life, loss of individual dignity and self-respect, and the aggravation of physical and psychological illnesses, alcoholism and drug abuse, crime, and social conflicts.
<br>
<br>(6) Federal, State, and local government budgets are undermined by deficits due to shortfalls in tax revenues and in increases in expenditures for unemployment compensation, public assistance, and other recession-related services in the areas of criminal justice, alcoholism and drug abuse, and physical and mental health.
<br>
<br>(b) The Congress further finds that:
<br>
<br>(1) High unemployment may contribute to inflation by diminishing labor training and skills, underutilizing capital resources, reducing the rate of productivity advance, increasing unit labor costs, and reducing the general supply of goods and services.
<br>
<br>(2) Aggregate monetary and fiscal policies alone have been unable to achieve full employment and production, increased real income, balanced growth, a balanced Federal budget, adequate productivity growth, proper attention to national priorities, achievement of an improved trade balance, and reasonable price stability, and therefore must be supplemented by other measures designed to serve these ends.
<br>
<br>(3) Attainment of these objectives should be facilitated by setting explicit short-term and medium-term economic goals, and by improved coordination among the President, the Congress, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
<br>
<br>(4) Increasing job opportunities and full employment would greatly contribute to the elimination of discrimination based upon sex, age, race, color, religion, national origin, handicap, or other improper factors.
<br>
<br>(c) The Congress further finds that an effective policy to promote full employment and production, increased real income, balanced growth, a balanced Federal budget, adequate productivity growth, proper attention to national priorities, achievement of an improved trade balance, and reasonable price stability should (1) be based on the development of explicit economic goals and policies involving the President, the Congress, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, with maximum reliance on the resources and ingenuity of the private sector of the economy, (2) include programs specifically designed to reduce high unemployment due to recessions, and to reduce structural unemployment within regional areas and among particular labor force groups, and (3) give proper attention to the role of increased exports and improvement in the international competitiveness of agriculture, business, and industry in providing productive employment opportunities and achieving an improved trade balance.
<br>
<br>(d) The Congress further finds that full employment and production, increased real income, balanced growth, a balanced Federal budget, adequate productivity growth, proper attention to national priorities, achievement of an improved trade balance through increased exports and improvement in the international competitiveness of agriculture, business, and industry, and reasonable price stability are important national requirements and will promote the economic security and well-being of all citizens of the Nation.

<br>SUBCHAPTER I—STRUCTURAL ECONOMIC POLICIES AND PROGRAMS INCLUDING TREATMENT OF RESOURCE RESTRAINTS
<br>§3111. Congressional statement of purpose
<br>
<br>The Congress recognizes that general economic policies alone have been unable to achieve the goals set forth in this chapter related to full employment, production, and real income, balanced growth, adequate growth in productivity, proper attention to national priorities, achievement of an improved trade balance through increased exports and improvement in the international competitiveness of agriculture, business, and industry, and achievement of reasonable price stability as provided for in section 1022b(b) of this title. It is, therefore, the purpose of this subchapter to require the President to initiate, as the President deems appropriate, with recommendations to the Congress where necessary, supplementary programs and policies to the extent that the President finds such action necessary to help achieve these goals, including the goals and timetable for the reduction of unemployment. Insofar as feasible without undue delay, any policies and programs so recommended shall be included in the Economic Report.

<br>
<br>(1) accelerated public works, including the development of standby public works projects;
<br>
<br>(2) public service employment;
<br>
<br>(3) State and local grant programs;
<br>
<br>(4) the levels and duration of unemployment insurance;

<br>
<br>(7) community development programs to provide employment in activities of value to the States, local communities (including rural areas), and the Nation;
<br>
<br>(8) Federal procurement programs which are targeted on labor surplus areas; and
<br>
<br>(9) augmentation of other employment and training programs which would help to reduce high levels of unemployment arising from cyclical causes.
<br>(b) Triggering mechanism
<br>
<br>In any countercyclical efforts undertaken, the President shall consider a triggering mechanism which will implement the program during a period of rising unemployment and phase out the program when unemployment is appropriately reduced, and incorporate effective means to facilitate individuals assisted under programs developed pursuant to this section to return promptly to regular private and public employment as the economy recovers.

<br>As an integral part of any countercyclical employment policies undertaken in accord with section 3112 of this title, the President shall, to the extent the President deems necessary, set forth programs and policies, including recommended legislation where needed, to coordinate economic action among the Federal Government, regions, States and localities, and the private sector to promote achievement of the purposes of this chapter and the Employment Act of 1946 [15 U.S.C. 1021 et seq.] and an economic environment in which State and local governments and private sector economic activity and employment will prosper. In considering programs and policies related to the private sector, full consideration shall be given to promoting the growth and well-being of small businesses and employment training programs through private sector incentives.
<br>(b) Fiscal needs and budget conditions
<br>
<br>In any efforts under this section, the President shall endeavor to meet criteria that establish programs which are funded to take account of the fiscal needs and budget conditions of the respective States and localities and their own efforts, with special attention to the rates of unemployment in such States and localities.

<br>(b) Improvement and expansion
