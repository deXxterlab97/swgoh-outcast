<br>(i) community-based work-learning-service alternatives that expand opportunities for community service and career-related work; and
<br>
<br>(ii) alternatives that develop sound citizenship, encourage student persistence, and make optimum use of assistance under this part in education and student development;
<br>
<br>(E) coordinate and carry out joint projects and activities to promote work service learning; and
<br>
<br>(F) carry out a comprehensive, longitudinal study of student academic progress and academic and career outcomes, relative to student self-sufficiency in financing their higher education, repayment of student loans, continued community service, kind and quality of service performed, and career choice and community service selected after graduation.
<br>(c) Application
<br>
<br>Each eligible institution may submit an application for funds authorized by subsection (f) of this section to use funds under subsection (b)(1) of this section at such time and in such manner as the Secretary, by regulation, may reasonably require.

<br>Part D—William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program
<br>Codification
<br>
<br>Parts A to J of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, Pub. L. 89–329 ("the HEA"), would typically have been classified to parts A to J of this subchapter. However, part C of title IV of the HEA could not be classified to part C of this subchapter when it was enacted because it amended and related to various provisions of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, Pub. L. 88–452, which were classified to Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare. As a result, parts D to J of title IV of the HEA were editorially designated as parts C to I of this subchapter to fill the gap left in the Code by the absence of a part C. That original part C of title IV of the HEA was subsequently repealed, and part C of title I of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 was redesignated to become a new part C of title IV of the HEA. In order to merge the pieces of the HEA together after the redesignation and logically realign the part structure of the HEA with that of the Code, part C of title IV of the HEA was editorially transferred from its original location in part C (§2751 et seq.) of subchapter I of chapter 34 of Title 42 to part C (§1087–51 et seq.) of this subchapter, and subsequent parts D to I of title IV of the HEA were redesignated as parts D to I of this subchapter. Part J of title IV of the HEA was omitted instead of redesignated as part J of this subchapter because it had already been transferred to another part of the HEA.
<br>Prior Provisions
<br>
<br>A prior part D, consisting of part E of title IV of Pub. L. 89–329, was redesignated part E of this subchapter.
<br>§1087a. Program authority
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>There are hereby made available, in accordance with the provisions of this part, such sums as may be necessary (1) to make loans to all eligible students (and the eligible parents of such students) in attendance at participating institutions of higher education selected by the Secretary, to enable such students to pursue their courses of study at such institutions during the period beginning July 1, 1994; and (2) for purchasing loans under section 1087i–1 of this title. Loans made under this part shall be made by participating institutions, or consortia thereof, that have agreements with the Secretary to originate loans, or by alternative originators designated by the Secretary to make loans for students in attendance at participating institutions (and their parents).
<br>(b) Designation
<br>(1) Program
<br>
<br>The program established under this part shall be referred to as the "William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program".
<br>(2) Direct loans
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, loans made to borrowers under this part that, except as otherwise specified in this part, have the same terms, conditions, and benefits as loans made to borrowers under section 1078 of this title, shall be known as "Federal Direct Stafford/Ford Loans".
