<br>Congressional Statement of Findings Respecting Use of Renewable Resources for Energy Production in Poor and Developing Countries and Role of International Financial Institutions
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 96–259, title VI, §601, June 3, 1980, 94 Stat. 432, provided that: "The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>"(1) without an adequate supply of energy at affordable prices the world's poor will continue to be deprived of jobs, food, water, shelter, and clothing, and poor countries will continue to be economically and politically unstable;
<br>
<br>"(2) dependence on increasingly expensive fossil fuel resources consumes too much of the capital available to poor countries with the result that funds are not available to meet the basic needs of poor people;
<br>
<br>"(3) in many developing countries the cost of large central generators and long distance electrical distribution makes it unlikely that rural energy by means of a national grid will contribute to meeting the needs of poor people;
<br>
<br>"(4) only one of eight rural inhabitants lives in an area which has access to electricity and even fewer rural inhabitants actually have or can afford electricity;
<br>
<br>"(5) wood, animal and agricultural waste, and other 'noncommercial' fuels still supply about half the total energy in developing countries and all but a seventh in rural sectors;
<br>
<br>"(6) growing dependence of the world's poor on wood for heating and cooking has forced the overcutting of forests and as a consequence erosion and loss of available agricultural land; and
<br>
<br>"(7) recent initiatives by the international financial institutions to develop and utilize decentralized solar, hydro, biomass, geothermal, and wind energy should be significantly expanded to make renewable energy resources increasingly available to the world's poor on a wide scale."
<br>§262k. Financial assistance to international financial institutions; considerations and criteria
<br>(a) Congressional declaration of intent
<br>
<br>United States active participation in international financial institution activity is based on our national objective of furthering the economic and social development of the nations of the world, in particular the developing nations. The attainment of this national objective is most effectively realized through a world economic and financial system which is both free and stable. Therefore, it is the intent of the United States Congress that United States financial assistance to the international financial institutions should be primarily directed to those projects that would not generate excess commodity supplies in world markets, displace private investment initiatives or foster departures from a market-oriented economy.
<br>(b) Effect of country adjustment programs; minimization of projected adverse impacts; avoidance of government subsidization
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the representatives of the United States to the international financial institutions described in subsection (d) to take into account in their review of loans, credits, or other utilization of the resources of their respective institutions, the effect that country adjustment programs would have upon individual industry sectors and international commodity markets in order to—
<br>
<br>(1) minimize any projected adverse impacts on such sector or markets of making such loans, credits, or utilization of resources; and
<br>
<br>(2) avoid whenever possible government subsidization of production and exports of international commodities without regard to economic conditions in the markets for such commodities.
<br>(c) Project proposals relating to mining, smelting, refining, and fabricating of minerals and metal products
<br>
<br>More specifically, the following criteria should be considered as a basis for a vote by the respective United States Executive Director to each of the international financial institutions described in subsection (d) against a project proposal involving the creation of new capacity or the expansion, improvement, or modification of mining, smelting, refining, and fabricating of minerals and metal products:
<br>
<br>(1) Analysis shows that the risks, returns, and incentives of a project are such that it could be financed at reasonable terms by commercial lending services.
<br>
<br>(2) Analysis by the United States Bureau of Mines indicates that surplus capacity in the industry for the primary product of the defined project would exist over half the period of the economic life of the project because of projected world demand and capacity conditions.
<br>
<br>(3) United States imports of the commodity constitute less than 50 percent of the domestic production of the primary product in those cases where the United States is the substantial producer of such commodities.
<br>(d) International financial institutions
<br>
<br>The international financial institutions referred to in subsections (a) and (b) are the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Development Association, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the African Development Bank.

<br>§262l. Environmental reform measures and remedial measures; Committee on Health and the Environment
<br>(a) Environmental reform measures; instructions to Executive Directors of Multilateral Development Banks
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Directors of the Multilateral Development Banks to—
<br>
<br>(1) vigorously promote a commitment of these institutions to—
<br>
<br>(A) add professionally trained staff with experience in ecology and related areas to undertake environmental review of projects, and strengthen existing staff exercising environmental responsibilities;
<br>
<br>(B) develop and implement management plans to ensure systematic and thorough environmental review of all projects and activities affecting the ecology and natural resources of borrowing countries, including—
<br>
<br>(i) creation of a line unit to carry out such reviews as part of the normal project cycle,
<br>
<br>(ii) appointment of an environmental advisor to the Presidents of the Multilateral Development Banks,
<br>
<br>(iii) institution of a regular program of monitoring all ongoing projects to ensure that contract conditions and general bank policies to protect the environment and indigenous peoples are fully complied with;
<br>
<br>(C) create career and other institutional incentives for all professionally trained bank staff to incorporate environmental and natural resources concerns into project planning and country programming activities;
<br>
<br>(2) vigorously promote changes in these institutions in their preparation of projects and country programs that will prompt staff and encourage borrower countries to—
<br>
<br>(A) actively and regularly involve environmental and health ministers, or comparable representatives, at the national, regional and local level, in the preparation of environmentally sensitive projects and in bank-supported country program planning and strategy sessions;
<br>
<br>(B) actively and regularly seek the participation of non-governmental indigenous peoples and conservation organizations in the host countries at all stages of project planning and strategy sessions;
<br>
<br>(C) fully inform local communities and appropriate non-governmental organizations with interests in local development projects of all project planning sufficiently in advance of project appraisal to allow informed participation of local communities and non-governmental organizations that may be adversely affected by them;
<br>
<br>(3) establish a regular integrated multidisciplinary planning process to conduct land use capability analyses in reviewing potential loans. Such plans shall include, but not be limited to, a review of ongoing or other potential resource utilization efforts in and adjacent to the project area;
<br>
<br>(4) vigorously promote a commitment of these institutions to develop and implement plans for the rehabilitation and management of the ecological resources of borrower nations on a sustained basis. Special attention shall be paid to soil conservation, wildlife, wetlands, estuaries, croplands, grasslands, forests, and fisheries, including—
<br>
<br>(A) long-term programs of research designed to manage ecosystems properly;
<br>
<br>(B) provision of adequate extension workers, park rangers, social forestry experts, and other appropriate personnel; and
<br>
<br>(C) improved programs of training in environmental science and land-use planning;
<br>

<br>
<br>(A) significantly increasing the proportion of energy project lending for energy efficiency improvements, and decentralized small scale facilities such as solar, wind, or biomass generating facilities; and
<br>
<br>(B) conducting an analysis of the comparative costs of any new energy generating facilities with the cost of increasing the energy efficiency in the project service area;
<br>
<br>(7) seek a commitment of these institutions to fund projects to protect and preserve crucial wetland systems and to avoid expenditures for projects designed to convert major wetland systems. Development proposals which may affect these areas should be the subject of detailed impact assessments so as to avoid detrimental impacts to fisheries, wildlife and other important resources;
<br>
<br>(8) vigorously promote the establishment within the Economic Development Institute of the World Bank of a component which provides training in environmental and natural resource planning and program development;
<br>
<br>(9) regularly raise, at meetings of the Boards of Directors of these institutions, the issue of their progress in improving their environmental performance, with specific focus on the measures set forth above; and
<br>
<br>(10) require at least a four week project review period between the time when staff recommendations are presented to the board and board action on any projects.
<br>(b) Joint evaluation of potential environmental problems and remedial measures
<br>
<br>The Secretaries of Treasury and State, and the Administrator of the Agency for International Development, shall ensure and coordinate a thorough evaluation within the United States Government of the potential environmental problems, and the adequacy of measures to address these problems, associated with all proposed loans for projects involving large impoundments of rivers in tropical countries; penetration roads into relatively undeveloped areas; and agricultural and rural development programs. The potential environmental problems to be addressed in such evaluations shall include those relating to deterioration of water quality; siltation; spread of waterborne diseases; forced resettlement; deforestation; threats to the land, health and culture of indigenous peoples; wetlands disruption; topsoil management, water logging and salinization in irrigation projects; and pesticide misuse and resistance.
<br>(c) Additional initiatives
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of State shall regularly undertake and continue diplomatic and other initiatives, in addition to those mentioned in subsection (a)(5), to discuss measures to improve the environmental performance of the Multilateral Development Banks with the representatives to these institutions, and with ministries from which they receive their instructions, of borrower and donor nations. In particular, joint efforts shall be undertaken with borrowers and donors to ensure cooperative implementation of the reforms described above.
<br>(d) Special meetings of Boards of Governors
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of State shall propose formally that the Boards of Governors of each Multilateral Development Bank hold a special meeting within the next twelve months, focused specifically on environmental performance and better implementation of multilateral development policies designed to protect the environment and indigenous peoples.
<br>(e) Reporting requirements generally
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Treasury shall prepare and submit to the Committees on Appropriations by January 15, 1987, and annually thereafter, a report documenting the progress the Multilateral Development Banks have made in implementing the environmental reform measures described in paragraphs one through eight of subsection (a).
<br>(f) Reporting requirements respecting environmental staffing
<br>
<br>In the report of the Secretary of the Treasury required by subsection (e), regarding the implementation of staffing measures suggested in subsection (a)(1)(A), the Secretary of the Treasury shall specifically discuss the progress of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development in upgrading and adding environmentally trained professionals to each of its six regional offices to review projects for their prospective ecological impacts.
<br>(g) Duties of Administrator of Agency for International Development
<br>
<br>The Administrator of the Agency for International Development in conjunction with the Secretaries of Treasury and State shall—
<br>
<br>(1) instruct overseas missions of the Agency for International Development and embassies of the United States to analyze the impacts of Multilateral Development Bank projects proposed to be undertaken in the host country well in advance of a project's approval by the relevant institution. Such reviews shall address the economic viability of the project; adverse impacts on the environment, natural resources, and indigenous peoples; and recommendations as to measures, including alternatives, that could eliminate or mitigate adverse impacts. If not classified under the national security system of classification, such information shall be made available to the public;
<br>
<br>(2) in preparation of reviews required by subsection (g)(1), compile a list of categories of projects likely to have adverse impacts on the environment, natural resources, or indigenous peoples. The list shall be developed in consultation with interested members of the public and made available to the Committee on Appropriations by December 31, 1986 and semiannually thereafter; and
<br>
<br>(3) study the feasibility of creating a cooperative "early warning system" for projects of concern with other interested donors.
<br>(h) Adverse impacts to environment, natural resources, or indigenous peoples; instructions to Executive Director of Multilateral Development Bank
<br>
<br>If a review required by subsection (g)(1) identifies adverse impacts to the environment, natural resources, or indigenous peoples, the Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director of the Multilateral Development Bank to seek changes to the project necessary to eliminate or mitigate those impacts.

<br>
<br>"(a) It is the policy of the United States that sustainable economic growth must be predicated on the sustainable management of natural resources. The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Directors of each multilateral development bank (MDB) to promote vigorously within each MDB the expansion of programs in areas which address the problems of global climate change through requirements to—
<br>
<br>"(1) augment and expand the professional staff of each MDB with expertise in end-use energy efficiency and conservation and renewable energy;
<br>
<br>"(2) develop methodologies which allow borrowing countries to include investments in end-use energy efficiency and renewable energy as explicit alternatives in the 'least cost' energy sector investments plans they prepare with MDB assistance. Such plans shall give priority to projects and programs which support energy conservation, end-use efficiency and renewable energy sources in major economic sectors, and shall compare the economic and environmental costs of those actions with the economic and environmental costs of investments in conventional energy supplies;
<br>
<br>"(3) provide analysis for each proposed loan to support additional power generating capacity, comparing the economic and environmental costs of investments in demand reduction, including energy conservation and end-use energy efficiency, with the economic and environmental costs of the proposal;
<br>
<br>"(4) assure that systematic, detailed environmental impact assessments (EIA) of proposed energy projects, or projects with potential significant environmental impacts, are conducted early in the project cycle. Assessments should include but not be limited to—
<br>
<br>"(A) consideration of a wide range of alternatives to the proposed project including, where feasible, alternative investments in end-use energy efficiency and non-conventional renewable energy; and
<br>
<br>"(B) encouragement and adoption of policies which allow for public participation in the EIA process;
<br>
<br>"(5) include environmental costs in the economic assessment of the proposed projects with significant potential environmental impacts, or power projects, and if possible for all projects which involve expansion of generating capacity of more than 10 MW, develop a standard increase in project cost as a surrogate for the environmental costs;
<br>
<br>"(6) encourage and promote end-use energy efficiency and renewable energy in negotiations of policy-based energy sector lending, and MDBs should consider not proceeding with policy-based sector loans which do not contain commitments from the borrowing country to devote a significant portion of its sector investments toward energy efficiency and renewable energy;
<br>
<br>"(7) provide technical assistance as a component of all energy sector lending to help borrowing countries identify and pursue end-use energy efficiency investments. This technical assistance shall include support for detailed audits of energy use and the development of institutional capacity to promote end-use energy efficiency and conservation;
<br>
<br>"(8) work with borrowing countries, with input from the public in both borrowing and donor countries, to develop loans for end-use energy efficiency and renewable energy, where possible 'bundling' small projects into larger, more easily financed projects; and
<br>
<br>"(9) seek the convening of a special seminar for board members and senior staff of each MDB concerning alternate energy investment opportunities and end-use energy efficiency and conservation.
<br>
<br>"(b) The Secretary of the Treasury as a part of the annual report to the Congress shall describe in detail, progress made by each of the MDBs in adopting and implementing programs meeting the standards set out in subsection (a), including in particular—

<br>
<br>"(2) progress made by each MDB in drafting and implementing least cost energy plans for each recipient country which meets requirements outlined in subsection (a)(2);
<br>
<br>"(3) the absolute dollar amounts, and proportion of total lending in the energy sector, of loans and portions of loans, approved by each MDB in the previous year for projects or programs of end-use energy efficiency and conservation and renewable energy.
<br>
<br>"(c) Not later than April 1, 1990, the Secretary of the Treasury shall request each MDB to prepare an analysis of the impact its current forestry sector loans will have on borrowing country emissions of CO2 and the status of proposals for specific forestry sector activities to reduce CO2 emissions.
<br>
<br>"(d)(1) The Administrator of the Agency for International Development shall issue guidance to all Agency missions and bureaus detailing the elements of a 'Global Warming Initiative' which will emphasize the need to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, especially CO2, through strategies consistent with their continued economic development. This initiative shall emphasize the need to accelerate sustainable development strategies in areas such as reforestation, biodiversity, end-use energy efficiency, least-cost energy planning, and renewable energy, and shall encourage mission directors to incorporate the elements of this initiative in developing their country programs.
<br>
<br>"(2) The Agency for International Development shall—
<br>
<br>"(A) increase the number and expertise of personnel devoted to end-use energy efficiency, renewable energy, and environmental activities in all bureaus and missions;

<br>
<br>"(3) Funds appropriated by this Act [see Tables for classification] to carry out the provisions of sections 103 to 106 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [22 U.S.C. 2151a to 2151d] may be used to reimburse the full cost of technical personnel detailed or assigned to, or contracted by, the Agency for International Development to provide expertise in the environmental sector.
<br>
<br>"(4)(A) [Amended section 2151q of this title.]
<br>
<br>"(B) Not less than $10,000,000 of the funds appropriated to carry out the provisions of sections 103 through 106 of such Act [22 U.S.C. 2151a to 2151d] (including funds for sub-Saharan Africa) shall be made available for biological diversity activities, of which $2,000,000 shall be made available for the Parks in Peril project, pursuant to the authority of section 119(b) [of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, 22 U.S.C. 2151q(b)] and $1,000,000 shall be available for the National Science Foundation's international biological diversity program.
<br>
<br>"(C) Funds obligated in prior fiscal years pursuant to the authority of section 119(b) may be expended in fiscal year 1990 pursuant to the authority of such section as amended by subparagraph (A).
<br>
<br>"(e) The Secretary of the Treasury shall—
<br>
<br>"(1) instruct the United States Executive Directors to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Development Association, the Inter-American Development Bank, the African Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the International Monetary Fund, to actively support lending portfolios which allow debtor developing countries to reduce or restructure debt in concert with the sustainable use of their natural resources. As a part of any such debt restructuring program, the United States Executive Director should require a thorough review of opportunities this initiative may offer for providing additional financial resources for the management of natural resources. The Secretary shall submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations on the progress of this program by April 30, 1990;
<br>

<br>
<br>(6) promote the adoption of lending strategies that place increased emphasis on energy efficient transportation programs. Such strategies shall consider alternatives to conventional mechanized transport such as nonmotorized vehicles, public transport and increased energy and cost efficiency of transportation systems; and
<br>
<br>(7) promote the use of existing and the development of new mechanisms to promote conservation of biological diversity. Existing resources to be consulted shall include but not be limited to Conservation Data Centers.
<br>(b) Bilateral and multilateral discussions to strengthen environmental performance of Multilateral Development Banks
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of State, in cooperation with the Administrator of the Agency for International Development, shall conduct bilateral and multilateral discussions with other members of the MDB's to further strengthen the environmental performance of each bank. These discussions shall include, but not be limited to organizational, administrative and procedural arrangements to remove impediments to the efficient and effective management of assistance programs necessary to protect and ensure the sustainable use of natural resources and to carry out such assistance programs in consultation with affected local communities.
<br>(c) Duties of Administrator of Agency for International Development
<br>
<br>The Administrator of the Agency for International Development shall—
<br>
<br>(1) in the submission of future "early warning system" reports, as required by the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1988, make use of resources that promote the conservation of biological diversity, such as Conservation Data Centers;
<br>
<br>(2) submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations, by January 15, 1989, on the Agency's activities and practices which encourage or discourage the use of renewable energy technologies overseas, and on ways to correct or refocus those efforts. This report shall include but is not limited to Agency activities which could be directed to develop a stronger interface with the private sector through the establishment of a United States Renewable Energy Industry Advisory Council;
<br>
<br>(3) issue guidance to all Agency missions stating that renewable energy resources and conservation are to be the centerpiece of its energy efforts, and meeting energy needs through these means shall be discussed in every Country Development Strategy Statement; and
<br>
<br>(4) take steps to implement recommendations set forth by a report of the Committee on Health and Environment on opportunities for the Agency to assist developing countries in the proper use of agricultural and industrial chemicals.

<br>§262l–3. Environmental and energy initiatives; benchmarks; Global Warming Initiative; appropriations
<br>(a) Instructions to Executive Directors of Multilateral Development Banks
<br>
<br>It is the policy of the United States that sustainable economic growth must be predicated on the sustainable management of natural resources. The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director of each multilateral development bank (MDB) to continue to promote vigorously the environmental and energy initiatives established in section 533(a) of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1991 (Public Law 101–513). The Secretary of the Treasury, in cooperation with the Secretary of State, shall also undertake direct, bilateral discussions with appropriate officials of the governments of the member nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development with a goal of building greater international support for the environmental goals established in subsection (d) of this section. The Secretary of the Treasury shall submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations by March 1, 1993, which describes the progress of these bilateral discussions.
<br>(b) Report to Congress
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Treasury shall, not later than March 1, 1993, submit a report to the Congress containing the same information as requested in section 533(b) of Public Law 101–513.
<br>(c) Improved environmental performance; benchmarks
<br>
<br>(1) In furtherance of the policies contained in section 533(a) of Public Law 101–513 and section 1308 1 of the International Development and Finance Act of 1989 (Public Law 101–240), and as a basis for measuring more effectively progress by the MDBs toward improved environmental performance, the Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Directors of the MDBs to encourage each MDB, at a minimum, to meet the benchmarks established in paragraph (2) in the areas of sustainable energy development, forest conservation, forced displacement of populations, and environmental impact assessment. On March 1, 1993 and March 1, 1994, the Secretary of the Treasury shall submit a report to the Congress describing in detail the progress being made by the MDBs in meeting these benchmarks.
<br>
<br>(2) For the purposes of paragraph (1), benchmarks are as follows:
<br>
<br>(A) In the area of sustainable energy development—
<br>
<br>(i) all loans in the energy sector should be based on, or support development of, "least-cost" integrated resource plans. Such plans shall include analyses of possible end-use energy efficiency measures and nonconventional renewable energy options, and such plans shall reflect the quantifiable environmental costs of proposed energy developments;
<br>
<br>(ii) a substantial portion of loans and grants in the energy, industry, and transportation sectors shall be devoted to end-use energy efficiency improvements and nonconventional renewable energy development; and
<br>
<br>(iii) all organizational units within the MDBs should create staff positions in a management role in end-use efficiency and renewable energy, which positions shall be staffed by individuals with professional experience in program design and management and educational degrees in relevant technical disciplines.
<br>
<br>(B) In the area of forest conservation—
<br>
<br>(i) forestry loans should not support commercial logging in relatively undisturbed primary forests, nor should loans result in any significant loss of tropical forests;
<br>
<br>(ii) forestry loans should not be disbursed until legal, economic, land tenure, and other policy conditions needed to ensure sustainability are in place;
<br>
<br>(iii) loans should not support mineral, petroleum, or other industrial development in, or construction or upgrading of roads through, relatively undisturbed primary forests unless adequate safeguards and monitoring systems, developed in consultation with local populations, are already in place to prevent degradation of the surrounding forests;
<br>
<br>(iv) loans should be consistent with and support the needs and rights of indigenous peoples and other long-term forest inhabitants and should not be made to countries which have shown an unwillingness to resolve fairly the territorial claims of such people; and
<br>
<br>(v) support for protection of biological diversity, in close consultation with local communities, should be increased to account for a larger proportion of MDB lending.
<br>
<br>(C) In the area of forced displacement of populations—
<br>
<br>(i) the World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, and Asian Development Bank should maintain a listing, available to the Secretary of the Treasury, of all ongoing projects involving forced displacement of populations, including the number of people displaced and a report on the status of the implementation of their resettlement policy guidelines for each such project, and obtain agreements with borrowers to ensure that all ongoing projects involving forced displacement will be in full compliance with their resettlement policy guidelines by mid-1993; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the African Development Bank should adopt and implement policy guidelines on forced displacement similar to such guidelines of the other MDBs.
<br>
<br>(D) In the area of procedures for environmental impact assessment (EIA)—
<br>
<br>(i) each MDB should require that draft and final EIA reports be made available to the public in borrowing and donor countries and that the public be offered timely opportunities for comment on the EIA process, including initial scoping sessions, review of EIA categories assigned to individual projects, and opportunities to comment on draft and final EIA reports;
<br>
<br>(ii) each MDB should apply EIA requirements to all sector loans and develop and apply the methodology for environmental assessment of structural adjustment loans;
<br>
<br>(iii) each MDB should require that the EIA process include analyses of the potential impacts of proposed projects on the global environment; and
<br>
<br>(iv) each MDB should require the head of the appropriate environmental unit, rather than project officers, determine the appropriate type of environmental analysis required under the bank's EIA procedures.
<br>(d) Global Warming Initiative
<br>
<br>The Administrator of the Agency for International Development shall instruct all Agency missions and bureaus to continue to implement all elements of the "Global Warming Initiative" as defined in, and which may continue under, the authorities of sections 2 533(c)(1) through (4) of Public Law 101–513. The Initiative shall continue to emphasize the need to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases through strategies consistent with continued economic development, such as forest conservation, end-use energy efficiency, least-cost energy planning, and renewable energy development. The Administrator shall direct Agency mission directors to incorporate these strategies in their country programs.
<br>(e) Environment and energy activities
<br>
<br>Of the funds appropriated by this Act under the headings in title II of this Act under "Agency for International Development", not less than $650,000,000 shall be made available for environment and energy activities, including funds earmarked under section 533 of this Act, including the following—

<br>§262m. Congressional findings and policies for multilateral development banks respecting environment, public health, natural resources, and indigenous peoples
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) United States assistance to the multilateral development banks should promote sustainable use of natural resources and the protection of the environment, public health, and the status of indigenous peoples in developing countries;
<br>
<br>(2) multilateral development bank projects, policies, and loans have failed in some cases to provide adequate safeguards for the environment, public health, natural resources, and indigenous peoples;
<br>
<br>(3) many development efforts of the multilateral development banks are more enduring and less costly if based on consultations with directly affected population groups and communities;
<br>
<br>(4) developing country governments sometimes do not ensure that appropriate policies and procedures are in place to use natural resources sustainably or consult with affected population groups and communities, where costs could be reduced or benefits made more enduring; and
<br>
<br>(5) in general, the multilateral development banks do not yet provide systematic and adequate assistance to their borrowers to encourage sustainable resource use and consultation with affected communities, where costs could be reduced or benefits made more enduring.

<br>
<br>(1) In the course of reviewing assistance proposals of the multilateral development banks, the Administrator of the Agency for International Development, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of State, shall ensure that other agencies and appropriate United States embassies and overseas missions of the Agency for International Development are instructed to analyze, where feasible, the environmental impacts of multilateral development loans well in advance of such loans' approval by the relevant institutions to determine whether the proposals will contribute to the sustainable development of the borrowing country.
<br>
<br>(2) To the extent possible, such reviews shall address the economic viability of the project, adverse impacts on the environment, natural resources, public health, and indigenous peoples, and recommendations as to measures, including alternatives, that could eliminate or mitigate adverse impacts.
<br>
<br>(3) If there is reason to believe that any such loan is particularly likely to have substantial adverse impacts, the Administrator of the Agency for International Development, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of State, shall ensure that an affirmative investigation of such impacts is undertaken in consultation with relevant Federal agencies. If not classified under the national security system of classification, the information collected pursuant to this paragraph shall be made available to the public.

<br>
<br>(1) The establishment of a unified program within each multilateral development bank to assess the extent to which bank lending benefits the least advantaged members of society, particularly women and the poor, and to increase the extent to which such members benefit from future bank lending.
<br>
<br>(2) The establishment of an office or other administrative procedures within each multilateral development bank to—
<br>
<br>(A) provide in-country liaison services for nongovernmental organizations operating at the community level;
<br>
<br>(B) monitor the impact of project and nonproject lending on local populations; and
<br>
<br>(C) ensure compliance with loan conditionalities, especially loan conditionalities relating to the protection of the quality of life of the poor and the rights of aboriginal minorities.
<br>
<br>(3) A major increase in the number of members of the professional staff of each regional multilateral development bank with training in environmental or social impact analysis or natural science, including—
<br>
<br>(A) recruitment of additional permanent professional staff; and
<br>
<br>(B) training programs for existing staff members in these subject areas.
<br>
<br>(4) With respect to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the establishment of a program for policy-based lending to promote the sustainable use of renewable resources and the protection of the environment in borrowing countries.
<br>
<br>(5) An increase in the length of any review period established by any multilateral development bank for board review of staff recommendations by such time as would be sufficient to allow the governments of member countries to review and comment on the staff recommendations before any action is taken by the board of directors of such bank on the recommendations.
<br>
<br>(b) The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director of each multilateral development bank to request the management of such bank to prepare an annual report which identifies and describes the most exemplary lending practices or loan components implemented during the preceding year with respect to each of the following lending policy goals for each major borrowing country or country group:
<br>
<br>(1) Benefit to the poor.
<br>
<br>(2) Involvement of nongovernmental organizations and local and indigenous populations in loan design, implementation, planning, and monitoring.
<br>
<br>(3) Integration of, consideration of, and concern for environmental quality and the sustainable use of natural resources into loan design, implementation, planning, and monitoring.
<br>
<br>(4) Recognition of and support for the economic and social development of women.

<br>§262o–2. Advocacy of policies to enhance general effectiveness of International Monetary Fund
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director of the International Monetary Fund to use aggressively the voice and vote of the Executive Director to do the following:
<br>
<br>(1) Vigorously promote policies to increase the effectiveness of the International Monetary Fund in structuring programs and assistance so as to promote policies and actions that will contribute to exchange rate stability and avoid competitive devaluations that will further destabilize the international financial and trading systems.
<br>
<br>(2) Vigorously promote policies to increase the effectiveness of the International Monetary Fund in promoting market-oriented reform, trade liberalization, economic growth, democratic governance, and social stability through—
<br>
<br>(A) establishing an independent monetary authority, with full power to conduct monetary policy, that provides for a non-inflationary domestic currency that is fully convertible in foreign exchange markets;
<br>
<br>(B) opening domestic markets to fair and open internal competition among domestic enterprises by eliminating inappropriate favoritism for small or large businesses, eliminating elite monopolies, creating and effectively implementing anti-trust and anti-monopoly laws to protect free competition, and establishing fair and accessible legal procedures for dispute settlement among domestic enterprises;
<br>
<br>(C) privatizing industry in a fair and equitable manner that provides economic opportunities to a broad spectrum of the population, eliminating government and elite monopolies, closing loss-making enterprises, and reducing government control over the factors of production;
<br>
<br>(D) economic deregulation by eliminating inefficient and overly burdensome regulations and strengthening the legal framework supporting private contract and intellectual property rights;
<br>
<br>(E) establishing or strengthening key elements of a social safety net to cushion the effects on workers of unemployment and dislocation; and
<br>
<br>(F) encouraging the opening of markets for agricultural commodities and products by requiring recipient countries to make efforts to reduce trade barriers.
<br>
<br>(3) Vigorously promote policies to increase the effectiveness of the International Monetary Fund, in concert with appropriate international authorities and other international financial institutions (as defined in section 262r(c)(2) of this title), in strengthening financial systems in developing countries, and encouraging the adoption of sound banking principles and practices, including the development of laws and regulations that will help to ensure that domestic financial institutions meet strong standards regarding capital reserves, regulatory oversight, and transparency.
<br>
<br>(4) Vigorously promote policies to increase the effectiveness of the International Monetary Fund, in concert with appropriate international authorities and other international financial institutions (as defined in section 262r(c)(2) of this title), in facilitating the development and implementation of internationally acceptable domestic bankruptcy laws and regulations in developing countries, including the provision of technical assistance as appropriate.
<br>
<br>(5) Vigorously promote policies that aim at appropriate burden-sharing by the private sector so that investors and creditors bear more fully the consequences of their decisions, and accordingly advocate policies which include—
<br>
<br>(A) strengthening crisis prevention and early warning signals through improved and more effective surveillance of the national economic policies and financial market development of countries (including monitoring of the structure and volume of capital flows to identify problematic imbalances in the inflow of short and medium term investment capital, potentially destabilizing inflows of offshore lending and foreign investment, or problems with the maturity profiles of capital to provide warnings of imminent economic instability), and fuller disclosure of such information to market participants;
<br>
<br>(B) accelerating work on strengthening financial systems in emerging market economies so as to reduce the risk of financial crises;
<br>
<br>(C) consideration of provisions in debt contracts that would foster dialogue and consultation between a sovereign debtor and its private creditors, and among those creditors;
<br>
<br>(D) consideration of extending the scope of the International Monetary Fund's policy on lending to members in arrears and of other policies so as to foster the dialogue and consultation referred to in subparagraph (C);
<br>
<br>(E) intensified consideration of mechanisms to facilitate orderly workout mechanisms for countries experiencing debt or liquidity crises;
<br>
<br>(F) consideration of establishing ad hoc or formal linkages between the provision of official financing to countries experiencing a financial crisis and the willingness of market participants to meaningfully participate in any stabilization effort led by the International Monetary Fund;
<br>
<br>(G) using the International Monetary Fund to facilitate discussions between debtors and private creditors to help ensure that financial difficulties are resolved without inappropriate resort to public resources; and
<br>
<br>(H) the International Monetary Fund accompanying the provision of funding to countries experiencing a financial crisis resulting from imprudent borrowing with efforts to achieve a significant contribution by the private creditors, investors, and banks which had extended such credits.
<br>
<br>(6) Vigorously promote policies that would make the International Monetary Fund a more effective mechanism, in concert with appropriate international authorities and other international financial institutions (as defined in section 262r(c)(2) of this title), for promoting good governance principles within recipient countries by fostering structural reforms, including procurement reform, that reduce opportunities for corruption and bribery, and drug-related money laundering.
<br>
<br>(7) Vigorously promote the design of International Monetary Fund programs and assistance so that governments that draw on the International Monetary Fund channel public funds away from unproductive purposes, including large "show case" projects and excessive military spending, and toward investment in human and physical capital as well as social programs to protect the neediest and promote social equity.
<br>
<br>(8) Work with the International Monetary Fund to foster economic prescriptions that are appropriate to the individual economic circumstances of each recipient country, recognizing that inappropriate stabilization programs may only serve to further destabilize the economy and create unnecessary economic, social, and political dislocation.
<br>
<br>(9) Structure International Monetary Fund programs and assistance so that the maintenance and improvement of core labor standards are routinely incorporated as an integral goal in the policy dialogue with recipient countries, so that—
<br>
<br>(A) recipient governments commit to affording workers the right to exercise internationally recognized core worker rights, including the right of free association and collective bargaining through unions of their own choosing;
<br>
<br>(B) measures designed to facilitate labor market flexibility are consistent with such core worker rights; and
<br>
<br>(C) the staff of the International Monetary Fund surveys the labor market policies and practices of recipient countries and recommends policy initiatives that will help to ensure the maintenance or improvement of core labor standards.
<br>
<br>(10) Vigorously promote International Monetary Fund programs and assistance that are structured to the maximum extent feasible to discourage practices which may promote ethnic or social strife in a recipient country.
<br>
<br>(11) Vigorously promote recognition by the International Monetary Fund that macroeconomic developments and policies can affect and be affected by environmental conditions and policies, and urge the International Monetary Fund to encourage member countries to pursue macroeconomic stability while promoting environmental protection.
<br>
<br>(12) Facilitate greater International Monetary Fund transparency, including by enhancing accessibility of the International Monetary Fund and its staff, fostering a more open release policy toward working papers, past evaluations, and other International Monetary Fund documents, seeking to publish all Letters of Intent to the International Monetary Fund and Policy Framework Papers, and establishing a more open release policy regarding Article IV consultations.
<br>
<br>(13) Facilitate greater International Monetary Fund accountability and enhance International Monetary Fund self-evaluation by vigorously promoting review of the effectiveness of the Office of Internal Audit and Inspection and the Executive Board's external evaluation pilot program and, if necessary, the establishment of an operations evaluation department modeled on the experience of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, guided by such key principles as usefulness, credibility, transparency, and independence.
<br>
<br>(14) Vigorously promote coordination with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and other international financial institutions (as defined in section 262r(c)(2) of this title) in promoting structural reforms which facilitate the provision of credit to small businesses, including microenterprise lending, especially in the world's poorest, heavily indebted countries.
<br>
<br>(15) Work with the International Monetary Fund to—
<br>
<br>(A) foster strong global anti-money laundering (AML) and combat the financing of terrorism (CFT) regimes;
<br>
<br>(B) ensure that country performance under the Financial Action Task Force anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing standards is effectively and comprehensively monitored;
<br>
<br>(C) ensure note is taken of AML and CFT issues in Article IV reports, International Monetary Fund programs, and other regular reviews of country progress;
<br>
<br>(D) ensure that effective AML and CFT regimes are considered to be indispensable elements of sound financial systems; and
<br>
<br>(E) emphasize the importance of sound AML and CFT regimes to global growth and development.
<br>(b) Coordination with other executive departments
<br>
<br>To the extent that it would assist in achieving the goals described in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury shall pursue the goals in coordination with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Commerce, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Administrator of the Agency for International Development, and the United States Trade Representative.
