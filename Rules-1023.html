<br>(A) State determined levels of performance for core indicators of performance
<br>(i) In general
<br>(I) Levels determined by the eligible agency
<br>
<br>Each eligible agency, with input from eligible recipients, shall establish in the State plan submitted under section 2342 of this title, for each year covered by the State plan, State determined levels of performance for each of the core indicators described under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (2) for career and technical education activities authorized under this subchapter. The level of performance for a core indicator shall be the same for all CTE concentrators in the State.
<br>(II) Technical assistance
<br>
<br>The Secretary may assist an eligible agency in establishing the State determined levels of performance under this subparagraph only at the request of that eligible agency.
<br>(III) Requirements
<br>
<br>Such State determined levels of performance shall, at a minimum—
<br>
<br>(aa) be expressed in a percentage or numerical form, so as to be objective, quantifiable, and measurable;
<br>
<br>(bb) require the State to continually make meaningful progress toward improving the performance of all career and technical education students, including the subgroups of students described in section 6311(h)(1)(C)(ii) of this title, and special populations, as described in section 2302(48) of this title; and
<br>
<br>(cc) have been subject to the public comment process described in subparagraph (B), and the eligible agency has provided a written response;
<br>
<br>(dd) when being adjusted pursuant to clause (ii), take into account how the levels of performance involved compare with the State levels of performance established for other States, considering factors including the characteristics of actual (as opposed to anticipated) CTE concentrators when the CTE concentrators entered the program, and the services or instruction to be provided;
<br>
<br>(ee) when being adjusted pursuant to clause (ii), be higher than the average actual performance of the 2 most recently completed program years, except in the case of unanticipated circumstances that require revisions in accordance with clause (iii); and
<br>
<br>(ff) take into account the extent to which the State determined levels of performance advance the eligible agency's goals, as set forth in the State plan.
<br>(ii) Allowable adjustment of State determined levels of performance for subsequent years
<br>
<br>Prior to the third program year covered by the State plan, each eligible agency may revise the State determined levels of performance for any of the core indicators of performance for the subsequent program years covered by the State plan, and submit the revised State determined levels of performance to the Secretary. If the eligible agency adjusts any levels of performance, the eligible agency shall adjust those levels in accordance with clause (i), and address written comments of stakeholders as described in subparagraph (B). The Secretary shall approve those revised levels of performance if those levels meet the requirements described in subclause (III) of clause (i). The State determined adjusted levels of performance identified under this clause shall be considered to be the State determined levels of performance for the State for such years and shall be incorporated into the State plan.
<br>(iii) Unanticipated circumstances
<br>
<br>If unanticipated circumstances arise in a State or changes occur related to improvements in data or measurement approaches, the eligible agency, at the end of the program year, may revise the State determined levels of performance required under this subparagraph. After public comment, as described in subparagraph (B), the eligible agency shall submit such revised levels of performance to the Secretary with evidence supporting the revision. The Secretary shall approve any such revision if that revision meets the requirements of clause (ii).
<br>(B) Public comment
<br>(i) In general

<br>
<br>Not less than 60 days prior to submission of the State plan, the eligible agency shall provide such stakeholders with the opportunity to provide written comments to the eligible agency, which shall be included in the State plan, regarding how the levels of performance described under subparagraph (A)—
<br>
<br>(I) meet the requirements of the law;
<br>
<br>(II) support the improvement of performance of all CTE concentrators, including subgroups of students, as described in section 6311(h)(1)(C)(ii) of this title, and special populations, as described in section 2302(48) of this title; and
<br>
<br>(III) support the needs of the local education and business community.

<br>(aa) for subgroups of students, as described in section 6311(h)(1)(C)(ii) of this title, and special populations, as described in section 2302(48) of this title, that are served under this chapter; and
<br>
<br>(bb) by the career and technical education programs or programs of study of the CTE concentrators, except that in a case in which reporting by such program or program of study is impractical, the data may be disaggregated by the career clusters of the CTE concentrators, if appropriate;
<br>
<br>(II) identify and quantify any disparities or gaps in performance on the State determined levels of performance under subparagraph (A) between any such subgroup or special population and the performance of all CTE concentrators served by the eligible agency under this chapter, which shall include a quantifiable description of the progress each such subgroup or special population of students served by the eligible agency under this chapter has made in meeting the State determined levels of performance; and

<br>
<br>No tribally controlled postsecondary career and technical institution for which an Indian Tribe has designated a portion of the funds appropriated for the Tribe from funds appropriated under section 13 of title 25, may be denied a contract for such portion under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act [25 U.S.C. 5301 et seq.] (except as provided in that Act), or denied appropriate contract support to administer such portion of the appropriated funds.
<br>(g) Complaint resolution procedure
