<br>When they are going into the tabernacle of the testimony, and when they are to come to the altar, to offer on it incense to the Lord,
<br>Lest perhaps they die. It shall be an ever- lasting law to him, and to his seed by successions.
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses,
<br>Saying: Take spices, of principal and cho- sen myrrh five hundred sicles, and of cinnamon half so much; that is, two hundred and fifty sicles, of calamus in like manner two hundred and fifty,
<br>And of cassia five hundred sicles by the weight of the sanctuary, of oil of olives the mea- sure hin:
<br>And thou shalt make the holy oil of unc- tion, an ointment compounded after the art of the perfumer,
<br>And therewith thou shalt anoint the taber- nacle of the testimony, and the ark of the testa- ment,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>And the table with the vessels thereof, the candlestick and furniture thereof, the altars of incense,
<br>And of holocaust, and all the furniture that belongeth to the service of them.
<br>And thou shalt sanctify all, and they shall be most holy: he that shall touch them shall be sanctified.
<br>Thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and shalt sanctify them, that they may do the office of priesthood unto me.
<br>And thou shalt say to the children of Is- rael: This oil of unction shall be holy unto me throughout your generations.
<br>The flesh of man shall not be anointed therewith, and you shall make none other of the same composition, because it is sanctified, and shall be holy unto you.
<br>What man soever shall compound such, and shall give thereof to a stranger, he shall be cut off from his people.
<br>And the Lord said to Moses: Take unto thee spices, stacte, and onycha, galbanum of sweet savour, and the clearest frankincense, all shall be of equal weight.
<br>And thou shalt make incense compounded by the work of the perfumer, well tempered to- gether, and pure, and most worthy of sanctifica- tion.
<br>And when thou hast beaten all into very small powder, thou shalt set of it before the tabernacle of the testimony, in the place where I will appear to thee. Most holy shall this incense be unto you.
<br>You shall not make such a composition for your own uses, because it is holy to the Lord.
<br>What man soever shall make the like, to enjoy the smell thereof, he shall perish out of his people.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 31
<br>
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>2 Behold, I have called by name Beseleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Juda, 3 And I have filled him with the spirit of God, with wisdom and understanding, and knowledge
<br>in all manner of work,
<br>To devise whatsoever may be artificially made of gold, and silver, and brass,
<br>Of marble, and precious stones, and variety of wood.
<br>And I have given him for his companion Oo- liab, the son of Achisamech, of the tribe of Dan. And I have put wisdom in the heart of every skil- ful man, that they may make all things which I have commanded thee,
<br>The tabernacle of the covenant, and the ark of the testimony, and the propitiatory, that is over it, and all the vessels of the tabernacle,
<br>And the table and the vessels thereof, the most pure candlestick with the vessels thereof, and the altars of incense,
<br>And of holocaust, and all their vessels, the laver with its foot,
<br>The holy vestments in the ministry for Aaron the priest, and for his sons, that they may execute their office, about the sacred things:
<br>The oil of unction, and the incense of spices in the sanctuary, all things which I have com- manded thee, shall they make.
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: See that you keep my sabbath; because it is a sign between me and you in your generations that you may know that I am the Lord, who sanctify you.
<br>keep you my sabbath: for it is holy unto you: he that shall profane it, shall be put to
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>death: he that shall do any work in it, his soul shall perish out of the midst of his people.
<br>Six days shall you do work: in the seventh day is the sabbath, the rest holy to the Lord. Every one that shall do any work on this day, shall die.
<br>Let the children of Israel keep the sabbath, and celebrate it in their generations. It is an everlasting covenant
<br>Between me and the children of Israel, and a perpetual sign. For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and in the seventh he ceased from work.
<br>And the Lord, when he had ended these words in Mount Sinai, gave to Moses two stone tables of testimony, written with the finger of God.
<br>
<br>Chapter 32
<br>And the people seeing that Moses delayed to come down from the mount, gathering together against Aaron, said: Arise, make us gods, that may go before us: For as to this Moses, the man that brought us out of the land of Egypt, we know not what has befallen him.
<br>And Aaron said to them: Take the golden earrings from the ears of your wives, and your sons and daughters, and bring them to me.
<br>And the people did what he had com- manded, bringing the earrings to Aaron.
<br>And when he had received them, he fash- ioned them by founders’ work, and made of them a molten calf. And they said: These are thy gods, O Israel, that have brought thee out of the land of Egypt.
<br>And when Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it, and made proclamation by a crier’s voice, saying To morrow is the solemnity of the
<br> 
<br>Lord.
<br>And rising in the morning, they offered holo- causts, and peace victims, and the people sat down to eat and drink, and they rose up to play. 7 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: Go, get thee down: thy people, which thou hast
<br>brought out of the land of Egypt, hath sinned.
<br>They have quickly strayed from the way which thou didst shew them: and they have made to themselves a molten calf, and have adored it, and sacrificing victims to it, have said: These are thy gods, O Israel, that have brought thee out of the land of Egypt.
<br>And again the Lord said to Moses: I see that this people is stiffnecked:
<br>Let me alone, that my wrath may be kin- dled against them, and that I may destroy them, and I will make of thee a great nation.
<br>But Moses besought the Lord his God, say- ing: Why, O Lord, is thy indignation enkindled against thy people, whom thou hast brought out of the land of Egypt, with great power, and with a mighty hand?
<br>Let not the Egyptians say, I beseech thee: He craftily brought them out, that he might kill them in the mountains, and destroy them from the earth: let thy anger cease, and be appeased upon the wickedness of thy people.
<br>Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou sworest by thy own self, saying: I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven: and this whole land that I have spoken of, I will give to your seed, and you shall possess it for ever:
<br>And the Lord was appeased from doing the evil which he had spoken against his people.
<br>And Moses returned from the mount, car- rying the two tables of the testimony in his hand, written on both sides,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>And made by the work of God; the writing also of God was graven in the tables.
<br>And Josue hearing the noise of the people shout. ing, said to Moses: The noise of battle is heard in the camp.
<br>But he answered: It is not the cry of men encouraging to fight, nor the shout of men com- pelling to flee: but I hear the voice of singers.
<br>And when he came nigh to the camp, he saw the calf, and the dances: and being very angry, he threw the tables out of his hand, and broke them at the foot of the mount:
<br>And laying hold of the calf which they had made, he burnt it, and beat it to powder, which he strewed into water, and gave thereof to the children of Israel to drink.
<br>And he said to Aaron: What has this peo- ple done to thee, that thou shouldst bring upon them a most heinous sin?
<br>And he answered him: Let not my lord be offended; for thou knowest this people, that they are prone to evil.
<br>They said to me: make us gods, that may go before us; for as to this Moses, who brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is befallen him.
<br>And I said to them: Which of you hath any gold? and they took and brought it to me; and I cast it into the fire, and this calf came out.
<br>And when Moses saw that the people were naked, (for Aaron had stripped them by occasion of the shame of the filth, and had set them naked among their enemies)
<br>Then standing in the gate of the camp, he said: If any man be on the Lord’s side, let him join with me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him:
<br>And he said to them: Thus saith the Lord God of Israel: Put every man his sword upon his thigh: go, and return from gate to gate through
<br> 
<br>the midst of the camp, and let every man kill his brother, and friend, and neighbour.
<br>And the sons of Levi did according to the words of Moses, and there were slain that day about three and twenty thousand men.
<br>And Moses said: You have consecrated your hands this day to the Lord, every man in his son and in his brother, that a blessing may be given to you.
<br>And when the next day was come, Moses spoke to the people: You have sinned a very great sin: I will go up to the Lord, if by any means I may be able to entreat him for your crime.
<br>And returning to the Lord, he said: I be- seech thee: this people hath sinned a heinous sin, and they have made to themselves gods of gold: either forgive them this trespass,
<br>Or if thou do not, strike me out of the book that thou hast written.
<br>And the Lord answered him: He that hath sinned against me, him will I strike out of my book:
<br>But go thou, and lead this people whither I have told thee: my angel shall go before thee. And I in the day of revenge will visit this sin also of theirs.
<br>The Lord therefore struck the people for the guilt, on occasion of the calf which Aaron had made.
<br>
<br>Chapter 33
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: Go, get thee up from this place, thou and thy people which thou hast brought out of the land of Egypt, into the land concerning which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying: To thy seed I will give it:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>And I will send an angel before thee, that I may cast out the Chanaanite, and the Amor- rhite, and the Hethite, and the Pherezite, and the Hevite, and the Jebusite,
<br>That thou mayst enter into the land that floweth with milk and honey. For I will not go up with thee, because thou art a stiffnecked people; lest I destroy thee in the way.
<br>And the people hearing these very bad tid- ings, mourned: and no man put on his orna- ments according to custom.
<br>And the Lord said to Moses: Say to the children of Israel: Thou art a stiffnecked people, once I shall come up in the midst of thee, and shall destroy thee. Now presently lay aside thy ornaments, that I may know what to do to thee. 6 So the children of Israel laid aside their or-
<br>naments by Mount Horeb.
<br>Moses also taking the tabernacle, pitched it without the camp afar off, and called the name thereof, The tabernacle of the covenant. And all the people, that had any question, went forth to the tabernacle of the covenant, without the camp.
<br>And when Moses went forth to the taberna- cle, all the people rose up, and every one stood in the door of his pavilion, and they beheld the back of Moses, till he went into the tabernacle.
<br>And when he was gone into the tabernacle of the covenant, the pillar of the cloud came down, and stood at the door, and he spoke with Moses. 10 And all saw that the pillar of the cloud stood at the door of the tabernacle. And they stood and worshipped at the doors of their tent. 11 And the Lord spoke to Moses face to face, as a man is wont to speak to his friend. And when he returned into the camp, his servant Jo- sue, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not
<br>from the tabernacle.
<br>12 And Moses said to the Lord: Thou com-
<br> 
<br>mandest me to lead forth this people; and thou dost not let me know whom thou wilt send with me, especially whereas thou hast said: I know thee by name, and thou hast found favour in my sight.
<br>If therefore I have found favour in thy sight, shew me thy face, that I may know thee, and may find grace before thy eyes: look upon thy people this nation.
<br>And the Lord said: My face shall go before thee, and I will give thee rest.
<br>And Moses said: If thou thyself dost not go before, bring us not out of this place.
<br>For how shall we be able to know, I and thy people, that we have found grace in thy sight, un- less thou walk with us, that we may be glorified by all people that dwell upon the earth?
<br>And the Lord said to Moses: This word also, which thou hast spoken, will I do; for thou hast found grace before me, and thee I have known by name.
<br>And he said: Shew me thy glory.
<br>He answered: I will shew thee all good, and I will proclaim in the name of the Lord before thee: and I will have mercy on whom I will, and I will be merciful to whom it shall please me.
<br>And again he said: Thou canst not see my face: for man shall not see me, and live.
<br>And again he said: Behold there is a place with me, and thou shalt stand upon the rock.
<br>And when my glory shall pass, I will set thee in a hole of the rock, and protect thee with my righthand till I pass:
<br>And I will take away my hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face thou canst not see.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 34
<br>And after this he said: Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the former, and I will write upon them the words, which were in the tables, which thou brokest.
<br>Be ready in the morning, that thou mayst forthwith go up into Mount Sinai, and thou shalt stand with me upon the top of the mount.
<br>Let no man go up with thee, and let not any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the oxen nor the sheep feed over against it.
<br>Then he cut out two tables of stone, such as had been before; and rising very early he went up into the Mount Sinai, as the Lord had com- manded him, carrying with him the tables.
<br>And when the Lord was come down in a cloud, Moses stood with him, calling upon the name of the Lord.
<br>And when he passed before him, he said: O the Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, patient and of much compassion, and true,
<br>Who keepest mercy unto thousands: who takest away iniquity, and wickedness, and sin, and no man of himself is innocent before thee. Who renderest the iniquity of the fathers to the children, and to the grandchildren unto the third and fourth generation.
<br>And Moses making haste, bowed down pros- trate unto the earth, and adoring,
<br>Said: If I have found grace in thy sight, O Lord, I beseech thee that thou wilt go with us, (for it is a stiffnecked people) and take away our iniquities and sin, and possess us.
<br>The Lord answered: I will make a covenant in the sight of all, I will do signs such as were never seen upon the earth, nor in any nations; that this people, in the midst of whom thou art, may see the terrible work of the Lord which I will do.
<br> 
<br>Observe all things which this day I com- mand thee: I myself will drive out before thy face the Amorrhite, and the Chanaanite, and the Hethite, and the Pherezite, and the Hevite, and the Jebusite.
<br>Beware thou never join in friendship with the inhabitants of that land, which may be thy ruin:
<br>But destroy their altars, break their statues and cut down their groves:
<br>Adore not any strange god. The Lord his name is jealous, he is a jealous God.
<br>Make no covenant with the men of those countries; lest, when they have committed for- nication with their gods, and have adored their idols, some one call thee to eat of the things sac- rificed.
<br>Neither shalt thou take of their daughters a wife for thy son, lest after they themselves have committed fornication, they make thy sons also to commit fornication with their gods.
<br>Thou shalt not make to thyself any molten gods.
<br>All of the male kind that openeth the womb, shall be mine. Of all beasts; both of oxen and of sheep, it shall be mine.
<br>The firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a sheep: but if thou wilt not give a price for it, it shall be slain. The firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem: neither shalt thou appear before me empty.
<br>Six days shalt thou work, the seventh day thou shalt cease to plough and to reap.
<br>Thou shalt keep the feast of weeks with the firstfruits of the corn of thy wheat harvest, and the feast when the time of the year returneth that all things are laid in.
<br>Three times in the year all thy males shall appear in the sight of the almighty Lord the God of Israel.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>For when I shall have taken away the na- tions from thy face, and shall have enlarged thy borders, no man shall lie in wait against thy land when thou shalt go up, and appear in the sight of the Lord thy God thrice in a year.
<br>Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacri- fice upon leaven; neither shall there remain in the morning any thing of the victim of the solemnity of the Phase.
<br>The first of the fruits of thy ground thou shalt offer in the house of the Lord thy God. Thou shalt not boil a kid in the milk of his dam. 27 And the Lord said to Moses: Write thee these words, by which I have made a covenant
<br>both with thee and with Israel.
<br>And he was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights: he neither ate bread nor drank water, and he wrote upon the tables the ten words of the covenant.
<br>And when Moses came down from the Mount Sinai, he held the two tables of the testi- mony, and he knew not that his face was horned from the conversation of the Lord.
<br>And Aaron and the children of Israel seeing the face of Moses horned, were afraid to come near.
<br>And being called by him, they returned, both Aaron and the rulers of the congregation. And after that he spoke to them,
<br>And all the children of Israel came to him: and he gave them in commandment all that he had heard of the Lord on Mount Sinai.
<br>And having done speaking, he put a veil upon his face.
<br>But when he went in to the Lord, and spoke with him, he took it away until he came forth, and then he spoke to the children of Israel all things that had been commanded him.
<br>And they saw that the face of Moses when he came out was horned, but he covered his face
<br> 
<br>again, if at any time he spoke to them.
<br>
<br>Chapter 35
<br>
<br>And all the multitude of the children of Israel being gathered together, he said to them: These are the things which the Lord hath commanded to be done:
<br>Six days you shall do work; the seventh day shall be holy unto you, the sabbath and the rest of the Lord: he that shall do any work on it, shall be put to death.
<br>You shall kindle no fire in any of your habi- tations on the sabbath day.
<br>And Moses said to all the assembly of the children of Israel: This is the word the Lord hath commanded, saying:
<br>Set aside with you firstfruits to the Lord. Let every one that is willing and hath a ready heart, offer them to the Lord: gold, and silver, and brass,
<br>Violet and purple, and scarlet twice dyed, and fine linen, goats’ hair,
<br>And rams’ skins dyed red, and violet coloured skins, setim wood,
<br>And oil to maintain lights, and to make oint- ment, and most sweet incense,
<br>Onyx stones, and precious stones, for the adorning of the ephod and the rational.
<br>Whosoever of you is wise, let him come, and make that which the Lord hath commanded:
<br>To wit, the tabernacle, and the roof thereof, and the cover, the rings, and the board- work with the bars, the pillars and the sockets:
<br>The ark and the staves, the propitiatory, and the veil that is drawn before it:
<br>The table with the bars and the vessels, and the loaves of proposition:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>The candlestick to bear up the lights, the vessels thereof and the lamps, and the oil for the nourishing of fires:
<br>The altar of incense, and the bars, and the oil of unction, and the incense of spices: the hanging at the door of the tabernacle:
<br>The altar of holocaust, and its grate of brass, with the bars and vessels thereof: the laver and its foot:
<br>The curtains of the court, with the pillars and the sockets, the hanging in the doors of the entry.
<br>The pins of the tabernacle, and of the court, with their little cords:
<br>The vestments that are to be used in the ministry of the sanctuary, the vesture of Aaron the high priest, and of his sons, to do the office of priesthood to me.
<br>And all the multitude of the children of Israel going out from the presence of Moses,
<br>Offered firstfruits to the Lord with a most ready and devout mind, to make the work of the tabernacle of the testimony. Whatever was nec- essary to the service and to the holy vestments, 22 Both men and women gave bracelets and earrings, rings and tablets: every vessel of gold
<br>was set aside to be offered to the Lord.
<br>If any man had violet, and purple, and scar- let twice dyed, fine linen and goats’ hair, ram- skins dyed red, and violet coloured skins,
<br>Metal of silver and brass, they offered it to the Lord, and setim wood for divers uses.
<br>The skilful women also gave such things as they had spun, violet, purple, and scarlet, and fine linen,
<br>And goats’ hair, giving all of their own ac- cord.
<br>But the princes offered onyx stones, and precious stones, for the ephod and the rational,
<br> 
<br>And spices and oil for the lights, and for the preparing of ointment, and to make the incense of most sweet savour.
<br>All, both men and women, with devout mind offered gifts, that the works might be done which the Lord had commanded by the hand of Moses. All the children of Israel dedicated vol- untary offerings to the Lord.
<br>And Moses said to the children of Israel: Behold, the Lord hath called by name Beseleel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Juda,
<br>And hath filled him with the spirit of God, with wisdom and understanding, and knowledge, and all learning,
<br>To devise and to work in gold and silver and brass,
<br>And in engraving stones, and in carpenters’ work. Whatsoever can be devised artificially,
<br>He hath given in his heart: Ooliab also, the son of Achisamech, of the tribe of Dan:
<br>Both of them hath he instructed with wis- dom, to do carpenters’ work, and tapestry, and embroidery in blue and purple, and scarlet twice dyed, and fine linen, and to weave all things, and to invent all new things.
<br>
<br>Chapter 36
<br>Beseleel therefore, and Ooliab, and every wise man, to whom the Lord gave wisdom and under- standing, to know how to work artificially, made the things that are necessary for the uses of the sanctuary, and which the Lord commanded.
<br>And when Moses had called them, and ev- ery skilful man, to whom the Lord had given wisdom, and such as of their own accord had offered themselves to the making of the work,
<br>He delivered all the offerings of the children
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>of Israel unto them. And while they were earnest about the work, the people daily in the morning offered their vows.
<br>Whereupon the workmen being constrained to come,
<br>Said to Moses: The people offereth more than is necessary.
<br>Moses therefore commanded proclamation to be made by the crier’s voice: Let neither man nor woman offer any more for the work of the sanctuary. And so they ceased from offering gifts,
<br>Because the things that were offered did suf- fice, and were too much.
<br>And all the men that were wise of heart, to accomplish the work of the tabernacle, made ten curtains of twisted fine linen, and violet, and purple, and scarlet twice dyed, with varied work, and the art of embroidering:
<br>The length of one curtain was twenty-eight cubits, and the breadth four: all the curtains were of the same size.
<br>And he joined five curtains, one to another, and the other five he coupled one to another.
<br>He made also loops of violet in the edge of one curtain on both sides, and in the edge of the other curtain in like manner,
<br>That the loops might meet one against an- other, and might be joined each with the other. 13 Whereupon also he cast fifty rings of gold, that might catch the loops of the curtains, and
<br>they might be made one tabernacle.
<br>He made also eleven curtains of goats’ hair, to cover the roof of the tabernacle:
<br>One curtain was thirty cubits long, and four cubits broad: all the curtains were of one measure.
<br>Five of which he joined apart, and the other six apart.
<br> 
<br>And he made fifty loops in the edge of one curtain, and fifty in the edge of another curtain, that they might be joined one to another.
<br>And fifty buckles of brass wherewith the roof might be knit together, that of all the cur- tains there might be made one covering.
<br>He made also a cover for the tabernacle of rams’ skins dyed red; and another cover over that of violet skins.
<br>He made also the boards of the tabernacle of setim wood standing.
<br>The length of one board was ten cubits; and the breadth was one cubit and a half.
<br>There were two mortises throughout every board, that one might be joined to the other. And in this manner he made for all the boards of the tabernacle.
<br>Of which twenty were at the south side southward,
<br>With forty sockets of silver, two sockets were put under one board on the two sides of the corners, where the mortises of the sides end in the corners.
<br>At that side also of the tabernacle, that looketh towards the north, he made twenty boards,
<br>With forty sockets of silver, two sockets for every board.
<br>But against the west, to wit, at that side of the tabernacle, which looketh to the sea, he made six boards,
<br>And two others at each corner of the taber- nacle behind:
<br>Which were also joined from beneath unto the top, and went together into one joint. Thus he did on both sides at the corners:
<br>So there were in all eight boards, and they had sixteen sockets of silver, to wit, two sockets under every board.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>He made also bars of setim wood, five to hold together the boards of one side of the taber- nacle,
<br>And five others to join together the boards of the other side; and besides these, five other bars at the west side of the tabernacle towards the sea.
<br>He made also another bar, that might come by the midst of the boards from corner to corner. 34 And the boards themselves he overlaid with gold casting for them sockets of silver. And their rings he made of gold, through which the bars might be drawn: and he covered the bars them-
<br>selves with plates of gold.
<br>He made also a veil of violet, and purple, scarlet and fine twisted linen, varied and distin- guished with embroidery:
<br>And four pillars of setim wood, which with their heads he overlaid with gold, casting for them sockets of silver.
<br>He made also a hanging in the entry of the tabernacle of violet, purple, scarlet, and fine twisted linen, with the work of an embroiderer.
<br>And five pillars with their heads, which he covered with gold, and their sockets he cast of brass.
<br>
<br>Chapter 37
<br>And Beseleel made also, the ark of setim wood: it was two cubits and a half in length, and a cubit and a half in breadth, and the height was of one cubit and a half: and he overlaid it with the purest gold within and without.
<br>And he made to it a crown of gold round about,
<br>Casting four rings of gold at the four corners thereof: two rings in one side, and two in the other.
<br> 
<br>And he made bars of setim wood, which he overlaid with gold,
<br>And he put them into the rings that were at the sides of the ark to carry it.
<br>He made also the propitiatory, that is, the oracle, of the purest gold, two cubits and a half in length, and a cubit and a half in breadth.
<br>Two cherubims also of beaten gold, which he set on the two sides of the propitiatory:
<br>One cherub in the top of one side, and the other cherub in the top of the other side: two cherubims at the two ends of the propitiatory,
<br>Spreading their wings, and covering the pro- pitiatory, and looking one towards the other, and towards it.
<br>He made also the table of setim wood, in length two cubits, and in breadth one cubit, and in height it was a cubit and a half.
<br>And he overlaid it with the finest gold, and he made to it a golden ledge round about,
<br>And to the ledge itself he made a polished crown of gold, of four fingers breadth, and upon the same another golden crown.
<br>And he cast four rings of gold, which he put in the four corners at each foot of the table, 14 Over against the crown: and he put the bars into them, that the table might be carried. 15 The bars also themselves he made of setim
<br>wood, and overlaid them with gold.
<br>And the vessels for the divers uses of the table, dishes, bowls, and cups, and censers of pure gold, wherein the libations are to be offered.
<br>He made also the candlestick of beaten work of the finest gold. from the shaft whereof its branches, its cups, and bowls, and lilies came out:
<br>19 Three cups in manner of a nut on each branch, and bowls withal and lilies: and three cups of the fashion of a nut in another branch, and bowls withal and lilies. The work of the six
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>branches, that went out from the shaft of the candlestick was equal.
<br>20	And in the shaft itself were four cups after the manner of a nut, and bowls withal at every one, and lilies:
<br>21	And bowls under two branches in three places, which together made six branches going out from one shaft.
<br>22	So both the bowls, and the branches were of the same, all beaten work of the purest gold. 23 He made also the seven lamps with their snuffers, and the vessels where the snuffings were
<br>to be put out, of the purest gold.
<br>The candlestick with all the vessels thereof weighed a talent of gold.
<br>He made also the alter of incense of setim wood, being a cubit on every side foursquare, and in height two cubits: from the corners of which went out horns.
<br>And he overlaid it with the purest gold, with its grate, and the sides, and the horns.
<br>And he made to it a crown of gold round about, and two golden rings under the crown at each side, that the bars might be put into them, and the altar be carried.
<br>And the bars themselves he made also of setim wood, and overlaid them with plates of gold.
<br>He compounded also the oil for the oint- ment of sanctification, and incense of the purest spices, according to the work of a perfumer.
<br>
<br>Chapter 38
<br>He made also the altar of holocaust of setim wood, five cubits square, and three in height:
<br>The horns whereof went out from the cor- ners, and he overlaid it with plates of brass.
<br>And for the uses thereof, he prepared divers
<br> 
<br>vessels of brass, cauldrons, tongs, fleshhooks, pothooks and firepans.
<br>And he made the grate thereof of brass, in manner of a net, and under it in the midst of the altar a hearth,
<br>Casting four rings at the four ends of the net at the top, to put in bars to carry it:
<br>And he made the bars of setim wood, and overlaid them with plates of brass:
<br>And he drew them through the rines that stood out in the sides of the altar. And the altar itself was not solid, but hollow, of boards, and empty within.
<br>He made also the laver of brass, with the foot thereof, of the mirrors of the women that watched at the door of the tabernacle.
<br>He made also the court, in the south side whereof were hangings of fine twisted linen of a hundred cubits.
<br>Twenty pillars of brass with their sockets, the beads of the pillars, and the whole graving of the work, of silver.
<br>In like manner at the north side the hang- ings, the pillars, and the sockets and heads of the pillars were of the same measure, and work and metal.
<br>But on that side that looketh to the west, there were hangings of fifty cubits, ten pillars of brass with their sockets, and the heads of the pillars, and all the graving of the work, of silver.
<br>Moreover, towards the east he prepared hangings of fifty cubits:
<br>Fifteen cubits of which, were on one side with three pillars, and their sockets:
<br>And on the other side (for between the two he made the entry of the tabernacle) there were hangings equally of fifteen cubits, and three pil- lars, and as many sockets.
<br>All the hangings of the court were woven with twisted linen.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>The sockets of the pillars were of brass, and their heads with all their gravings of silver: and he overlaid the pillars of the court also with silver.
<br>And he made in the entry thereof an em- broidered hanging of violet, purple, scarlet, and fine twisted linen, that was twenty cubits long, and five cubits high, according to the measnre of all the hangings of the court.
<br>And the pillars in the entry were four, with sockets of brass, and their heads and gravings of silver.
<br>The pins also of the tabernacle and of the court round about he made of brass.
<br>These are the instruments of the tabernacle of the testimony, which were counted according to the commandment of Moses, in the ceremonies of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, son of Aaron the priest:
<br>Which Beseleel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur of the tribe of Juda, had made, as the Lord commanded by Moses.
<br>Having for his companion Ooliab, the son of Achisamech, of the tribe of Dan: who also was an ex- cellent artificer in wood, and worker in tapestry and embroidery in violet, purple, scar- let, and fine linen.
<br>All the gold that was spent in the work of the sanctuary, and that was offered in gifts, was nine and twenty talents, and seven hundred and thirty sicles according to the standard of the sanctuary.
<br>And it was offered by them that went to be numbered, from twenty years old and upwards, of six hundred and three thousand five hundred and fifty men able to bear arms.
<br>There were moreover a hundred talents of silver, whereof were cast the sockets of the sanc- tuary, and of the entry where the veil hangeth.
<br>A hundred sockets were made of a hun-
<br> 
<br>dred talents, one talent being reckoned for every socket.
<br>And of the thousand seven hundred and seventy- five he made the heads of the pillars, which also he overlaid with silver.
<br>And there were offered of brass also seventy-two thousand talents, and four hundred sicles besides,
<br>Of which were cast the sockets in the entry of the tabernacle of the testimony, and the al- tar of brass with the grate thereof, and also the vessels that belong to the use thereof.
<br>And the sockets of the court as well round about as in the entry thereof, and the pins of the tabernacle, and of the court round about.
<br>
<br>Chapter 39
<br>And he made, of violet and purple, scarlet and fine linen, the vestments for Aaron to wear when he ministered in the holy places, as the Lord commanded Moses.
<br>So he made an ephod of gold, violet, and purple, and scarlet twice dyed, and fine twisted linen,
<br>With embroidered work, and he cut thin plates of gold, and drew them small into threads, that they might be twisted with the woof of the foresaid colours,
<br>And two borders coupled one to the other in the top on either side,
<br>And a girdle of the same colours, as the Lord had commanded Moses.
<br>He prepared also two onyx stones, fast set and closed in gold, and graven, by the art of a lapidary, with the names of the children of Israel: 7 And he set them in the sides of the ephod, for a memorial of the children of Israel, as the
<br>Lord had commanded Moses.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>He made also a rational with embroidered work, according to the work of the ephod, of gold, violet, purple, and scarlet twice dyed, and fine twisted linen:
<br>Foursquare, double, of the measure of a span.
<br>And he set four rows of precious stones in it. In the first row was a sardius, a topaz, an emerald.
<br>In the second, a carbuncle, a sapphire, and a jasper.
<br>In the third, a ligurius, an agate, and an amethyst.
<br>In the fourth, a chrysolite, an onyx, and a beryl, set and enclosed in gold by their rows.
<br>And the twelve stones, were engraved with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel, each one with its several name.
<br>They made also in the rational little chains, linked one to another, of the purest gold,
<br>And two hooks, and as many rings of gold. And they set the rings on either side of the ra- tional,
<br>On which rings the two golden chains should hang, which they put into the hooks that stood out in the corners of the ephod.
<br>These both before and behind so answered one another, that the ephod and the rational were bound together,
<br>Being fastened to the girdle, and strongly coupled with rings, which a violet fillet joined, lest they should flag loose, and be moved one from the other, as the Lord commanded Moses. 20 They made also the tunic of the ephod all
<br>of violet,
<br>And a hole for the head in the upper part at the middle, and a woven border round about the hole:
<br>And beneath at the feet pomegranates of violet, purple, scarlet, and fine twisted linen:
<br> 
<br>And little bells of the purest gold, which they put between the pomegranates at the bot- tom of the tunic round about:
<br>To wit, a bell of gold, and a pomegranate, wherewith the high priest went adorned, when he discharged his ministry, as the Lord had com- manded Moses.
<br>They made also fine linen tunics with wo- ven work for Aaron and his sons:
<br>And mitres with their little crowns of fine linen:
<br>And linen breeches of fine linen:
<br>And a girdle of fine twisted linen, violet, purple, and scarlet twice dyed, of embroidery work, as the Lord had commanded Moses.
<br>They made also the plate of sacred vener- ation of the purest gold, and they wrote on it with the engraving of a lapidary: The Holy of the Lord:
<br>And they fastened it to the mitre with a violet fillet, as the Lord had commanded Moses. 31 So all the work of the tabernacle and of the roof of the testimony was finished: and the children of Israel did all things which the Lord
<br>had commanded Moses.
<br>And they offered the tabernacle, and the roof, and the whole furniture, the rings, the boards, the bars, the pillars and their sockets,
<br>The cover of rams’ skins dyed red, and the other cover of violet skins,
<br>The veil, the ark, the bars, the propitiatory,
<br>The table, with the vessels thereof, and the loaves of proposition:
<br>The candlestick, the lamps, and the furni- ture of them, with the oil:
<br>The altar of gold, and the ointment, and the incense of spices:
<br>And the hanging in the entry of the taber- nacle:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>The altar of brass, the grate, the bars, and all the vessels thereof: the laver, with the foot thereof: the hangings of the court, and the pil- lars, with their sockets:
<br>The hanging in the entry of the court, and the little cords, and the pins thereof. Noth- ing was wanting of the vessels, that were com- manded to be made for the ministry of the taber- nacle, and for the roof of the covenant.
<br>The vestments also, which the priests, to wit, Aaron and his sons, use in the sanctuary,
<br>The children of Israel offered, as the Lord had commanded.
<br>And when Moses saw all things finished, he blessed them.
<br>
<br>Chapter 40
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>2 The first month, the first day of the month, thou shalt set up the tabernacle of the testimony, 3 And shalt put the ark in it, and shalt let
<br>down the veil before it:
<br>And thou shalt bring in the table, and set upon it the things that are commanded accord- ing to the rite. The candlestick shall stand with its lamps,
<br>And the altar of gold, whereon the incense is burnt before the ark of the testimony. Thou shalt put the hanging in the entry of the taber- nacle,
<br>And before it the altar of holocaust.
<br>The laver between the altar and the taber- nacle, and thou shalt fill it with water.
<br>And thou shalt encompass the court with hangings, and the entry thereof.
<br>And thou shalt take the oil of unction and anoint the tabernacle with its vessels, that they may be sanctified:
<br> 
<br>The altar of holocaust and all its vessels:
<br>The laver with its foot: thou shalt conse- crate all with the oil of unction, that they may be most holy.
<br>And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the tabernacle of the testimony, and having washed them with water,
<br>Thou shalt put on them the holy vest- ments, that they may minister to me, and that the unction of them may prosper to an everlast- ing priesthood.
<br>And Moses did all that the Lord had com- manded.
<br>So in the first month of the second year, the first day of the month, the tabernacle was set up.
<br>And Moses reared it up, and placed the boards and the sockets and the bars, and set up the pillars,
<br>And spread the roof over the tabernacle, putting over it a cover, as the Lord had com- manded.
<br>And he put the testimony in the ark, thrusting bars underneath, and the oracle above. 19 And when he had brought the ark into the tabernacle, he drew the veil before it to fulfil the
<br>command ment of the Lord.
<br>20 And he set the table in the tabernacle of the testimony, at the north side, without the veil, 21 Setting there in order the loaves of propo-
<br>sition, as the Lord had commanded Moses.
<br>He set the candlestick also in the tabernacle of the testimony, over against the table on the south side,
<br>Placing the lamps in order, according to the precept of the Lord.
<br>He set also the altar of gold under the roof of the testimony, over against the veil,
<br>And burnt upon it the incense of spices, as the Lord had commanded Moses.
<br> 
<br>
<br>And he put also the hanging in the entry of the tabernacle of the testimony,
<br>And the altar of holocaust in the entry of the testimony, offering the holocaust, and the sacrifices upon it, as the Lord had commanded. 28 And he set the laver between the taberna- cle of the testimony and the altar, filling it with
<br>water.
<br>And Moses and Aaron, and his sons, washed their hands and feet,
<br>When they went into the tabernacle of the covenant, and went to the altar, as the Lord had commanded Moses.
<br>He set up also the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, drawing the hanging in the entry thereof. After all things were per- fected,
<br>The cloud covered the tabernacle of the testimony, and the glory of the Lord filled it.
<br>Neither could Moses go into the tabernacle of the covenant, the cloud covering all things, and the majesty of the Lord shining, for the cloud had covered all.
<br>If at any time the cloud removed from the tabernacle, the children of Israel went forward by their troops:
<br>If it hung over, they remained in the same place.
<br>For the cloud of the Lord hung over the tabernacle by day, and a fire by night, in the sight of all the children of Israel throughout all their mansions.

<br>Book of Leviticus
<br>
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>And the Lord called Moses, and spoke to him from the tabernacle of the testimony, saying:
<br>Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: The man among you that shall offer to the Lord a sacrifice of the cattle, that is, offering victims of oxen and sheep:
<br>If his offering be a holocaust, and of the herd, he shall offer a male without blemish, at the door of the testimony, to make the Lord favourable to him.
<br>And he shall put his hand upon the head of the victim: and it shall be acceptable, and help to its expiation.
<br>And he shall immolate the calf before the Lord: and the priests the sons of Aaron shall of- fer the blood thereof, pouring it round about the altar, which is before the door of the tabernacle. 6 And when they have flayed the victim, they
<br>shall cut the joints into pieces:
<br>And shall put fire on the altar, having before laid in order a pile of wood.
<br>And they shall lay the parts that are cut out in order thereupon: to wit, the head, and all things that cleave to the liver;
<br>The entrails and feet being washed with wa- ter. And the priest shall burn them upon the altar for a holocaust, and a sweet savour to the Lord.
<br>And if the offering be of the flocks, a holo- caust of sheep or of goats, he shall offer a male
<br> 
<br>
<br>without blemish.
<br>And he shall immolate it at the side of the altar that looketh to the north, before the Lord: but the sons of Aaron shall pour the blood thereof upon the altar round about.
<br>And they shall divide the joints, the head, and all that cleave to the liver: and shall lay them upon the wood, under which the fire is to be put.
<br>But the entrails and the feet they shall wash with water. And the priest shall offer it all and burn it all upon the altar for a holocaust, and most sweet savour to the Lord.
<br>But if the oblation of a holocaust to the Lord be of birds, of turtles, or of young pigeons:
<br>The priest shall offer it at the altar: and twisting back the neck, and breaking the place of the wound, he shall make the blood run down upon the brim of the altar.
<br>But the crop of the throat, and the feathers he shall cast beside the altar at the east side, in the place where the ashes are wont to be poured out.
<br>And he shall break the pinions thereof, and shall not cut, nor divide it with a knife: and shall burn it upon the altar, putting fire under the wood. It is a holocaust and oblation of most sweet savour to the Lord.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 2
<br>When any one shall offer an oblation of sacrifice to the Lord, his offering shall be of fine flour: and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense, 2 And shall bring it to the sons of Aaron the priests. And one of them shall take a handful of the flour and oil, and all the frankincense; and shall put it a memorial upon the altar for a most
<br>sweet savour to the Lord.
<br>And the remnant of the sacrifice shall be Aaron’s, and his sons’, holy of holies of the of- ferings of the Lord.
<br>But when thou offerest a sacrifice baked in the oven of   flour,   to   wit,   loaves   with- out leaven, tempered with oil, and unleavened wafers, anointed with oil:
<br>If thy oblation be from the fryingpan, of flour tempered with oil, and without leaven:
<br>Thou shalt divide it into little pieces, and shalt pour oil upon it.
<br>And if the sacrifice be from the gridiron, in like manner the flour shall be tempered with oil. 8 And when thou offerest it to the Lord, thou
<br>shalt deliver it to the hands of the priest.
<br>And when he hath offered it, he shall take a memorial out of the sacrifice, and burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour to the Lord.
<br>And whatsoever is left, shall be Aaron’s, and his sons’: holy of holies of the offerings of the Lord.
<br>Every oblation that is offered to the Lord shall be made without leaven: neither shall any leaven or honey be burnt in the sacrifice to the Lord.
<br>You shall offer only the firstfruits of them and gifts: but they shall not be put upon the altar, for a savour of sweetness.
<br>Whatsoever sacrifice thou offerest, thou shalt season it with salt: neither shalt thou take
<br> 
<br>away the salt of the covenant of thy God from thy sacrifice. In all thy oblations thou shalt offer salt.
<br>But if thou offer a gift of the firstfruits of thy corn to the Lord, of the ears yet green, thou shalt dry it at the fire, and break it small like meal; and so shalt thou offer thy firstfruits to the Lord:
<br>Pouring oil upon it and putting on frank- incense, because it is the oblation of the Lord.
<br>Whereof the priest shall burn for a memo- rial of the gift, part of the corn broken small and of the oil, and all the frankincense.
<br>
<br>Chapter 3
<br>And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offer- ings, and he will offer of the herd, whether male or female: he shall offer them without blemish before the Lord.
<br>And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his victim, which shall be slain in the entry of the tabernacle of the testimony: and the sons of Aaron the priests shall pour the blood round about upon the altar.
<br>And they shall offer of the sacrifice of peace offerings, for an oblation to the Lord: the fat that covereth the entrails, and all the fat that is within,
<br>The two kidneys with the fat wherewith the flanks are covered, and the caul of the liver with the two little kidneys.
<br>And they shall burn them upon the altar, for a holocaust, putting fire under the wood: for an oblation of most sweet savour to the Lord.
<br>But if his oblation and the sacrifice of peace offering be of the flock, whether he offer male or female, they shall be without blemish.
<br>If he offer a lamb before the Lord:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>He shall put his hand upon the head of the victim. And it shall be slain in the entry of the tabernacle of the testimony: and the sons of Aaron shall pour the blood thereof round about upon the altar.
<br>And they shall offer of the victim of peace offerings, a sacrifice to the Lord: the fat and the whole rump,
<br>With the kidneys, and the fat that covereth the belly and all the vitals and both the little kidneys, with the fat that is about the flanks, and the caul of the liver with the little kidneys. 11 And the priest shall burn them upon the altar, for the food of the fire, and of the oblation
<br>of the Lord.
<br>If his offering be a goat, and he offer it to the Lord:
<br>He shall put his hand upon the head thereof: and shall immolate it in the entry of the tabernacle of the testimony. And the sons of Aaron shall pour the blood thereof round about upon the altar.
<br>And they shall take of it for the food of the Lord’s fire, the fat that covereth the belly, and that covereth all the vital parts:
<br>The two little kidneys with the caul that is upon them which is by the flanks, and the fat of the liver with the little kidneys.
<br>And the priest shall burn them upon the altar, for the food of the fire, and of a most sweet savour. All the fat shall be the Lord’s.
<br>By a perpetual law for your generations, and in all your habitations: neither blood nor fat shall you eat at all.
<br>
<br>Chapter 4
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>Say to the children of Israel: The soul that
<br> 
<br>sinneth through ignorance, and doth any thing concerning any of the commandments of the Lord, which he commanded not to be done:
<br>If the priest that is anointed shall sin, mak- ing the people to offend, he shall offer to the Lord for his sin a calf without blemish.
<br>And he shall bring it to the door of the tes- timony before the Lord: and shall put his hand upon the head thereof, and shall sacrifice it to the Lord.
<br>He shall take also of the blood of the calf: and carry it into the tabernacle of the testimony. 6 And having dipped his finger in the blood, he shall sprinkle with it seven times before the
<br>Lord, before the veil of the sanctuary.
<br>And he shall put some of the same blood upon the horns of the altar of the sweet incense most acceptable to the Lord, which is in the tabernacle of the testimony. And he shall pour all the rest of the blood at the foot of the altar of holocaust in the entry of the tabernacle.
<br>And he shall take off the fat of the calf for the sin offering, as well that which covereth the entrails, as all the inwards:
<br>The two little kidneys, and the caul that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the fat of the liver with the little kidneys:
<br>As it is taken off from the calf of the sacri- fice of peace offerings. And he shall burn them upon the altar of holocaust.
<br>But the skin and all the flesh with the head and the feet and the bowels and the dung:
<br>And the rest of the body, he shall carry forth without the camp into a clean place where the ashes are wont to be poured out: and he shall burn them upon a pile of wood. They shall be burnt in the place where the ashes are poured out.
<br>And if all the multitude of Israel shall be ignorant, and through ignorance shall do that
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>which is against the commandment of the Lord, 14 And afterwards shall understand their sin: they shall offer for their sin a calf, and shall bring
<br>it to the door of the tabernacle.
<br>And the ancients of the people shall put their hands upon the head thereof before the Lord. And the calf being immolated in the sight of the Lord:
<br>The priest that is anointed shall carry of the blood into the tabernacle of the testimony.
<br>And shall dip his finger in it and sprinkle it seven times before the veil.
<br>And he shall put of the same blood on the horns of the altar that is before the Lord, in the tabernacle of the testimony. And the rest of the blood he shall pour at the foot of the altar of holocaust, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the testimony.
<br>And all the fat thereof he shall take off, and shall burn it upon the altar:
<br>Doing so with this calf, as he did also with that before. And the priest praying for them, the Lord will be merciful unto them.
<br>But the calf itself he shall carry forth with- out the camp, and shall burn it as he did the former calf: because it is for the sin of the mul- titude.
<br>If a prince shall sin, and through ignorance do any one of the things that the law of the Lord forbiddeth,
<br>And afterwards shall come to know his sin: he shall offer a buck goat without blemish, a sac- rifice to the Lord.
<br>And he shall put his hand upon the head thereof: and when he hath immolated it in the place where the holocaust is wont to be slain before the Lord, because it is for sin,
<br>The priest shall dip his finger in the blood of the victim for sin, touching therewith the
<br> 
<br>horns of the altar of holocaust, and pouring out the rest at the foot thereof.
<br>But the fat he shall burn upon it, as is wont to be done with the victims of peace offerings. And the priest shall pray for him, and for his sin: and it shall be forgiven him.
<br>And if any one of the people of the land shall sin through ignorance, doing any of those things that by the law of the Lord are forbidden, and offending,
<br>And shall come to know his sin: he shall offer a she goat without blemish.
<br>And he shall put his hand upon the head of the victim that is for sin: and shall immolate it in the place of the holocaust.
<br>And the priest shall take of the blood with his finger, and shall touch the horns of the altar of holocaust: and shall pour out the rest at the foot thereof.
<br>But taking off all the fat, as is wont to be taken away of the victims of peace offerings, he shall burn it upon the altar, for a sweet savour to the Lord: and he shall pray for him, and it shall be forgiven him.
<br>But if he offer of the flock a victim for his sin, to wit, an ewe without blemish:
<br>He shall put his hand upon the head thereof, and shall immolate it in the place where the victims of holocausts are wont to be slain.
<br>And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and shall touch the horns of the altar of holocaust: and the rest he shall pour out at the foot thereof.
<br>All the fat also he shall take off, as the fat of the ram that is offered for peace offerings is wont to be taken away: and shall burn it upon the altar, for a burnt sacrifice of the Lord. And he shall pray for him and his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 5
<br>If any one sin, and hear the voice of one swearing, and is a witness either because he himself hath seen, or is privy to it: if he do not utter it, he shall bear his iniquity.
<br>Whosoever toucheth any unclean thing, ei- ther that which hath been killed by a beast, or died of itself, or any other creeping thing: and forgetteth his uncleanness, he is guilty, and hath offended.
<br>And if he touch any thing of the uncleanness of man, according to any uncleanness wherewith he is wont to be defiled: and having forgotten it, come afterwards to know it, he shall be guilty of an offence.
<br>The person that sweareth, and uttereth with his lips, that he would do either evil or good, and bindeth the same with an oath, and his word: and having forgotten it afterwards under- standeth his offence,
<br>Let him do penance for his sin:
<br>And offer of the flocks an ewe lamb, or a she goat, and the priest shall pray for him and for his sin.
<br>But if he be not able to offer a beast, let him offer two turtles, or two young pigeons to the Lord, one for sin, and the other for a holocaust, 8 And he shall give them to the priest: who shall offer the first for sin, and twist back the head of it to the little pinions, so that it stick to
<br>the neck, and be not altogether broken off.
<br>9 And of its blood he shall sprinkle the side of the altar: and whatever is left, he shall let it drop at the bottom thereof, because it is for sin. 10 And the other he shall burn for a holocaust, as is wont to be done. And the priest shall pray for him, and for his sin, and it shall be forgiven
<br>him.
<br>And if his hand be not able to offer two
<br> 
<br>turtles, or two young pigeons, he shall offer for his sin the tenth part of an ephi of flour. He shall not put oil upon it, nor put any frankincense thereon, because it is for sin.
<br>And he shall deliver it to the priest, who shall take a handful thereof, and shall burn it upon the altar for a memorial of him that offered it:
<br>Praying for him and making atonement. But the part that is left, he himself shall have for a gift.
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>If any one shall sin through mistake, trans- gressing the ceremonies in those things that are sacrificed to the Lord, he shall offer for his of- fence a ram without blemish out of the flocks, that may be bought for two sicles, according to the weight of the sanctuary.
<br>And he shall make good the damage itself which he hath done, and shall add the fifth part besides, delivering it to the priest, who shall pray for him, offering the ram: and it shall be forgiven him.
<br>If any one sin through ignorance, and do one of those things which by the law of the Lord are forbidden, and being guilty of sin, under- stand his iniquity:
<br>He shall offer of the flocks a ram without blemish to the priest, according to the measure and estimation of the sin. And the priest shall pray for him, because he did it ignorantly:  And it shall be forgiven him,
<br>Because by mistake he trespassed against the Lord.
<br>
<br>Chapter 6
<br>The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>2 Whosoever shall sin, and despising the Lord,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>shall deny to his neighbour the thing delivered to his keeping, which was committed to his trust; or shall by force extort any thing, or commit oppression;
<br>3	Or shall find a thing lost, and denying it, shall also swear falsely, or shall do any other of the many things, wherein men are wont to sin:
<br>4	Being convicted of the offence, he shall re- store
<br>5	All that he would have gotten by fraud, in the principal, and the fifth part besides, to the owner, whom he wronged.
<br>6	Moreover for his sin he shall offer a ram with- out blemish out of the flock: and shall give it to the priest, according to the estimation and mea- sure of the offence.
<br>7	And he shall pray for him before the Lord: and he shall have forgiveness for every thing in doing of which he bath sinned.
<br>8	And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>9	Command Aaron and his sons: This is the law of a holocaust. It shall be burnt upon the altar, all night until morning: the fire shall be of the same altar.
<br>10	The priest shall be vested with the tunick and the linen breeches; and he shall take up the ashes of that which the devouring fire hath burnt: and putting them beside the altar,
<br>11	Shall put off his former vestments, and be- ing clothed with others, shall carry them forth without the camp, and shall cause them to be consumed to dust in a very clean place.
<br>12	And the fire on the altar shall always burn, and the priest shall feed it, putting wood on it ev- ery day in the morning: and laying on the holo- caust, shall burn thereupon the fat of the peace offerings.
<br>13	This is the perpetual fire which shall never go out on the altar.
<br>14	This is the law of the sacrifice and libations,
<br> 
<br>which the children of Aaron shall offer before the Lord, and before the altar.
<br>15	The priest shall take a handful of the flour that is tempered with oil, and all the frankin- cense that is put upon the flour: and he shall burn on the altar for a memorial of most sweet odour to the Lord.
<br>16	And the part of the flour that is left, Aaron and his sons shall eat, without leaven: and he shall eat it in the holy place of the court of the tabernacle.
<br>17	And therefore it shall not be leavened, be- cause part thereof is offered for the burnt sacri- fice of the Lord. It shall be most holy, as that which is offered for sin and for trespass.
<br>18	The males only of the race of Aaron shall eat it. It shall be an ordinance everlasting in your generations concerning the sacrifices of the Lord: Every one that toucheth them shall be sanctified.
<br>19	And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>20	This is the oblation of Aaron, and of his sons, which they must offer to the Lord, in the day of their anointing. They shall offer the tenth part of an ephi of flour for a perpetual sacrifice, half of it in the morning, and half of it in the evening.
<br>21	It shall be tempered with oil, and shall be fried in a fryingpan.
<br>22	And the priest that rightfully succeedeth his father, shall offer it hot, for a most sweet odour to the Lord: and it shall he wholly burnt on the altar.
<br>23	For every sacrifice of the priest shall be consumed with fire: neither shall any man eat thereof.
<br>24	And the Lord spoke to Moses. saying:
<br>25	Say to Aaron and his sons: This is the law of the victim for sin. In the place where the holocaust is offered, it shall be immolated before
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>the Lord. It is holy of holies.
<br>26	The priest that offereth it, shall eat it in a holy place, in the court of the tabernacle.
<br>27	Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof, shall be sanctified. If a garment be sprinkled with the blood thereof, it shall be washed in a holy place.
<br>28	And the earthen vessel, wherein it was sod- den, shall be broken: but if the vessel be of brass, it shall be scoured, and washed with water.
<br>29	Every male of the priestly race shall eat of the flesh thereof, because it is holy of holies.
<br>30	For the victim that is slain for sin, the blood of which is carried into the tabernacle of the testimony to make atonement in the sanctu- ary, shall not be eaten, but shall be burnt with fire.
<br>
<br>Chapter 7
<br>This also is the law of the sacrifice for a trespass: it is most holy.
<br>Therefore where the holocaust is immolated, the victim also for a trespass shall be slain: the blood thereof shall be poured round about the altar.
<br>They shall offer thereof the rump and the fat that covereth the entrails:
<br>The two little kidneys, and the fat which is by the flanks, and the caul of the liver with the little kidneys.
<br>And the priest shall burn them upon the altar: it is the burnt sacrifice of the Lord for a trespass.
<br>Every male of the priestly race, shall eat this flesh in a holy place, because it is most holy.
<br>As the sacrifice for sin is offered, so is also that for a trespass: the same shall be the law of both these sacrifices. It shall belong to the priest
<br> 
<br>that offereth it.
<br>The priest that offereth the victim of holo- caust, shall have the skin thereof.
<br>And every sacrifice of flour that is baked in the oven, and whatsoever is dressed on the gridiron, or in the fryingpan, shall be the priest’s that offereth it.
<br>Whether they be tempered with oil, or dry, all the sons of Aaron shall have one as much as another.
<br>This is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings that is offered to the Lord.
<br>If the oblation be for thanksgiving, they shall offer loaves without leaven tempered with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and fine flour fried, and cakes tempered and mingled with oil.
<br>Moreover loaves of leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanks, which is offered for peace of- ferings:
<br>Of which one shall be offered to the Lord for firstfruits, and shall be the priest’s that shall pour out the blood of the victim.
<br>And the flesh of it shall be eaten the same day: neither shall any of it remain until the morning.
<br>If any man by vow, or of his own accord offer a sacrifice, it shall in like manner be eaten the same day. And if any of it remain until the morrow, it is lawful to eat it.
<br>But whatsoever shall be found on the third day shall be consumed with fire.
<br>If any man eat of the flesh of the victim of peace offerings on the third day, the oblation shall be of no effect: neither shall it profit the offerer. Yea rather, whatsoever soul shall defile itself with such meat, shall be guilty of trans- gression.
<br>The flesh that hath touched any unclean thing, shall not be eaten: but shall be burnt with
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>fire. He that is clean shall eat of it.
<br>If any one that is defiled shall eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which is offered to the Lord, he shall be cut off from his people.
<br>And he that hath touched the uncleanness of man, or of beast, or of any thing that can defile, and shall eat of such kind of flesh: shall be cut off from his people.
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>Say to the children of Israel: The fat of a sheep, and of an ox, and of a goat you shall not eat.
<br>The fat of a carcass that hath died of itself, and of a beast that was caught by another beast, you shall have for divers uses.
<br>If any man eat the fat that should be of- fered for the burnt sacrifice of the Lord, he shall perish out of his people.
<br>Moreover you shall not eat the blood of any creature whatsoever, whether of birds or beasts. 27 Every one that eateth blood, shall perish
<br>from among the people.
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>Speak to the children of Israel, saying: He that offereth a victim of peace offerings to the Lord, let him offer therewith a sacrifice also, that is, the libations thereof.
<br>He shall hold in his hands the fat of the victim, and the breast. And when he hath of- fered and consecrated both to the Lord, he shall deliver them to the priest,
<br>Who shall burn the fat upon the altar. But the breast shall be Aaron’s and his sons’.
<br>The right shoulder also of the victim, of peace offerings shall fall to the priest for first- fruits.
<br>He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood, and the fat: he shall have the right shoulder also for his portion.
<br> 
<br>For the breast that is elevated and the shoulder that is separated I have taken of the children of Israel, from off their victims of peace offerings: and have given them to Aaron the priest, and to his sons, by a law for ever, from all the people of Israel.
<br>This is the anointing of Aaron and his sons, in the ceremonies of the Lord, in the day when Moses offered them, that they might do the office of priesthood,
<br>And the things that the Lord commanded to be given them by the children of Israel, by a perpetual observance in their generations.
<br>This is the law of holocaust, and of the sacrifice for sin, and for trespass, and for conse- cration, and the victims of peace offerings:
<br>Which the Lord appointed to Moses in mount Sinai, when he commanded the children of Israel, that they should offer their oblations to the Lord in the desert of Sinai.
<br>
<br>Chapter 8
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>Take Aaron with his sons, their vestments, and the oil of unction: a calf for sin, two rams, a basket with unleavened bread.
<br>And thou shalt gather together all the con- gregation to the door of the tabernacle.
<br>And Moses did as the Lord had commanded. And all the multitude being gathered together before the door of the tabernacle:
<br>He said: This is the word that the Lord hath commanded to be done.
<br>And immediately, he offered Aaron and his sons. And when he had washed them,
<br>He vested the high priest with the strait linen garment, girding him with the girdle, and putting on him the violet tunick: and over it he
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>put the ephod.
<br>And binding it with the girdle, he fitted it to the rational, on which was Doctrine and Truth. 9 He put also the mitre upon his head: and upon the mitre over the forehead, he put the plate of gold, consecrated with sanctification, as
<br>the Lord had commanded him.
<br>He took also the oil of unction, with which he anointed the tabernacle, with all the furniture thereof.
<br>And when he had sanctified and sprinkled the altar seven times, he anointed it, and all the vessels thereof: and the laver with the foot thereof, he sanctified with the oil.
<br>And he poured it upon Aaron’s head: and he anointed and consecrated him.
<br>And after he had offered his sons, he vested them with linen tunicks, and girded them with girdles: and put mitres on them as the Lord had commanded.
<br>He offered also the calf for sin: and when Aaron and his sons had put their hands upon the head thereof,
<br>He immolated it: and took the blood, and dipping his finger in it, he touched the horns of the altar round about. Which being expiated, and sanctified, he poured the rest of the blood at the bottom thereof.
<br>But the fat that was upon the entrails, and the caul of the liver, and the two little kidneys, with their fat, he burnt upon the altar.
<br>And the calf with the skin, and the flesh and the dung, he burnt without the camp, as the Lord had commanded.
<br>He offered also a ram for holocaust. And when Aaron and his sons had put their hands upon its head:
<br>He immolated it, and poured the blood thereof round about the altar.
<br> 
<br>And cutting the ram into pieces, the head thereof, and the joints, and the fat he burnt in the fire.
<br>Having first washed the entrails, and the feet, and the whole ram together he burnt upon the altar: because it was a holocaust of most sweet odour to the Lord, as he had commanded him.
<br>He offered also the second ram, in the con- secration of priests: and Aaron, and his sons put their hands upon the head thereof.
<br>And when Moses had immolated it, he took of the blood thereof, and touched the tip of Aaron’s right ear, and the thumb of his right hand, and in like manner also the great toe of his right foot.
<br>He offered also the sons of Aaron: and when with the blood of the ram that was immo- lated, he had touched the tip of the right ear of every one of them, and the thumbs of their right hands, and the great toes of their right feet, the rest he poured on the altar round about.
<br>But the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that covereth the entrails, and the caul of the liver, and the two kidneys with their fat, and with the right shoulder, he separated.
<br>And taking out of the basket of unleavened bread, which was before the Lord, a loaf without leaven, and a cake tempered with oil and a wafer, he put them upon the fat, and the right shoulder: 27 Delivering  all  to  Aaron, and  to his  sons.
<br>Who having lifted them up before the Lord,
<br>He took them again from their hands, and burnt them upon the altar of holocaust: because it was the oblation of consecration, for a sweet odour of sacrifice to the Lord.
<br>And he took of the ram of consecration, the breast for his portion, elevating it before the Lord, as the Lord had commanded him.
<br>And taking the ointment, and the blood
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>that was upon the altar, he sprinkled Aaron, and his vestments, and his sons, and their vestments with it.
<br>And when he had sanctified them in their vestments, he commanded them, saying: Boil the flesh before the door of the tabernacle, and there eat it. Eat ye also the loaves of conse- cration, that are laid in the basket, as the Lord commanded me, saying: Aaron and his sons shall eat them.
<br>And whatsoever shall be left of the flesh and the loaves, shall be consumed with fire.
<br>And you shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle for seven days, until the day wherein the time of your consecration shall be expired. For in seven days the consecration is finished:
<br>As at this present it hath been done, that the rite of the sacrifice might be accomplished.
<br>Day and night shall you remain in the tabernacle observing the watches of the Lord, lest you die. For so it hath been commanded me.
<br>And Aaron and his sons did all things which the Lord spoke by the hand of Moses.
<br>
<br>Chapter 9
<br>And when the eighth day was come, Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the ancients of Israel, and said to Aaron:
<br>Take of the herd a calf for sin, and a ram for a holocaust, both without blemish, and offer them before the Lord.
<br>And to the children of Israel thou shalt say: Take ye a he goat for sin, and a calf, and a lamb, both of a year old, and without blemish for a holocaust.
<br>Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings. And immolate them before the Lord, offering for
<br> 
<br>the sacrifice of every one of them flour tempered with oil: for to day the Lord will appear to you. 5 They brought therefore all things that Moses had commanded before the door of the taberna-
<br>cle: where when all the multitude stood,
<br>Moses said: This is the word, which the Lord hath commanded. Do it, and his glory will ap- pear to you.
<br>And he said to Aaron: Approach to the al- tar, and offer sacrifice for thy sin. Offer the holo- caust, and pray for thyself and for the people: and when thou hast slain the people’s victim, pray for them, as the Lord hath commanded.
<br>And forthwith Aaron, approaching to the altar, immolated the calf for his sin.
<br>And his sons brought him the blood of it: and he dipped his finger therein, and touched the horns of the altar, and poured the rest at the foot thereof.
<br>And the fat, and the little kidneys, and the caul of the liver, which are for sin, he burnt upon the altar, as the Lord had commanded Moses.
<br>But the flesh and skins thereof he burnt with fire without the camp.
<br>He immolated also the victim of holocaust: and his sons brought him the blood thereof, which he poured round about on the altar.
<br>And the victim being cut into pieces, they brought to him the head and all the members: all which he burnt with fire upon the altar.
<br>Having first washed the entrails and the feet with water.
<br>Then offering for the sin of the people, he slew the he goat: and expiating the altar,
<br>He offered the holocaust.
<br>Adding in the sacrifice the libations, which are offered withal, and burning them upon the altar, besides the ceremonies of the morning holocaust.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>He immolated also the bullock and the ram, and peace offerings of the people: and his sons brought him the blood, which he poured upon the altar round about.
<br>The fat also of the bullock, and the rump of the ram, and the two little kidneys with their fat, and the caul of the liver,
<br>They put upon the breasts. And after the fat was burnt upon the altar,
<br>Aaron separated their breasts, and the right shoulders, elevating them before the Lord, as Moses had commanded.
<br>And stretching forth his hands to the peo- ple, he blessed them. And so the victims for sin, and the holocausts, and the peace offerings being finished, he came down.
<br>And Moses and Aaron went into the taber- nacle of the testimony, and afterwards came forth and blessed the people. And the glory of the Lord appeared to all the multitude.
<br>And, behold, a fire, coming forth from the Lord, devoured the holocaust, and the fat that was upon the altar: which when the multitude saw, they praised the Lord, falling on their faces.
<br>
<br>Chapter 10
<br>And Nadab and Abiu, the sons of Aaron, taking their censers, put fire therein, and incense on it, offering before the Lord strange fire: which was not commanded them.
<br>And fire coming out from the Lord destroyed them: and they died before the Lord.
<br>And Moses said to Aaron: This is what the Lord hath spoken. I will be sanctified in them that approach to me: and I will be glorified in the sight of all the people. And when Aaron heard this, he held his peace.
<br>And Moses called Misael and Elisaphan, the
<br> 
<br>sons of Oziel, the uncle of Aaron, and said to them: Go and take away your brethren from be- fore the sanctuary, and carry them without the camp.
<br>And they went forthwith and took them as they lay, vested with linen tunicks, and cast them forth, as had been commanded them.
<br>And Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and Ithamar, his sons: Uncover not your heads, and rend not your garments, lest perhaps you die, and indignation come upon all the congre- gation. Let your brethren, and all the house of Israel, bewail the burning which the Lord has kindled.
<br>But you shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle: otherwise you shall perish, for the oil of the holy unction is on you. And they did all things according to the precept of Moses.
<br>The Lord also said to Aaron:
<br>You shall not drink wine nor any thing that may make drunk, thou nor thy sons, when you enter into the tabernacle of the testimony, lest you die. Because it is an everlasting precept; through your generations:
<br>And that you may have knowledge to dis- cern between holy and unholy, between unclean and clean:
<br>And may teach the children of Israel all my ordinances which the Lord hath spoken to them by the hand of Moses.
<br>And Moses spoke to Aaron, and to Eleazar and Ithamar, his sons that were left: Take the sacrifice that is remaining of the oblation of the Lord, and eat it without leaven beside the altar, because it is holy of holies.
<br>And you shall eat it in a holy place: which is given to thee and thy sons of the oblations of the Lord, as it hath been commanded me.
<br>The breast also that is offered, and the shoulder that is separated, you shall eat in a
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>most clean place, thou and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee. For they are set aside for thee and thy children, of the victims of peace offerings of the children of Israel.
<br>Because they have elevated before the Lord the shoulder and the breast, and the fat that is burnt on the altar: and they belong to thee and to thy sons by a perpetual law, as the Lord hath commanded.
<br>While these things were a doing, when Moses sought for the buck goat, that had been offered for sin, he found it burnt. And being an- gry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron that were left, he said:
<br>Why did you not eat in the holy place the sacrifice for sin, which is most holy, and given to you, that you may bear the iniquity of the people, and may pray for them in the sight of the Lord.
<br>Especially, whereas none of the blood thereof hath been carried within the holy places: and you ought to have eaten it in the sanctuary, as was commanded me?
<br>Aaron answered: This day hath been of- fered the victim for sin, and the holocaust before the Lord: and to me what thou seest has hap- pened. How could I eat it, or please the Lord in the ceremonies, having a sorrowful heart?
<br>Which when Moses had heard he was sat- isfied.
<br>
<br>Chapter 11
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying: 2 Say to the children of Israel: These are the animals which you are to eat of all the living
<br>things of the earth.
<br>3 Whatsoever hath the hoof divided, and cheweth the cud among the beasts, you shall eat.
<br> 
<br>But whatsoever cheweth indeed the cud, and hath a hoof, but divideth it not, as the camel, and others: that you shall not eat, but shall reckon it among the unclean.
<br>The cherogrillus which cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof, is unclean.
<br>The hare also: for that too cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof.
<br>And the swine, which, though it divideth the hoof, cheweth not the cud.
<br>The flesh of these you shall not eat, nor shall you touch their carcasses, because they are un- clean to you.
<br>These are the things that breed in the wa- ters, and which it is lawful to eat. All that hath fins, and scales, as well in the sea, as in the rivers, and the pools, you shall eat.
<br>But whatsoever hath not fins and scales, of those things that move and live in the waters, shall be an abomination to you,
<br>And detestable. Their flesh you shall not eat: and their carcasses you shall avoid.
<br>All that have not fins and scales, in the waters, shall be unclean.
<br>Of birds these are they which you must not eat, and which are to be avoided by you: The eagle, and the griffon, and the osprey.
<br>And the kite, and the vulture, according to their kind.
<br>And all that is of the raven kind, according to their likeness.
<br>The ostrich, and the owl, and the larus, and the hawk according to its kind.
<br>The screech owl, and the cormorant, and the ibis.
<br>And the swan, and the bittern, and the porphyrion.
<br>The heron, and the charadroin according to its kind, the houp also, and the bat.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Of things that fly, whatsoever goeth upon four feet, shall be abominable to you.
<br>But whatsoever walketh upon four feet, but hath the legs behind longer, wherewith it hop- peth upon the earth,
<br>That you shall eat: as the bruchus in its kind, the attacus, and ophimachus, and the lo- cust, every, one according to their kind.
<br>But of flying things whatsoever hath four feet only, shall be an abomination to you.
<br>And whosoever shall touch the carcasses of them, shall be defiled: and shall be unclean until the evening:
<br>And if it be necessary that he carry any of these things when they are dead: he shall wash his clothes, and shall be unclean until the sun set.
<br>Every beast that hath a hoof, but divideth it not, nor cheweth the cud shall be unclean: and he that toucheth it, shall be defiled.
<br>That which walketh upon hands of all an- imals which go on all four, shall be unclean: he that shall touch their carcasses shall be defiled until evening.
<br>And he that shall carry such carcasses, shall wash his clothes, and shall be unclean until evening: because all these things are unclean to you.
<br>These also shall be reckoned among un- clean things, of all that move upon the earth. The weasel, and the mouse, and the crocodile, every one according to their kind:
<br>The shrew, and the chameleon, and the stellio, and the lizard, and the mole.
<br>All these are unclean. He that toucheth their carcasses shall be unclean until the evening. 32 And upon what thing soever any of their carcasses shall fall, it shall be defiled, whether it be a vessel of wood, or a garment, or skins or haircloths: or any thing in which work is done.
<br> 
<br>They shall be dipped in water, and shall be un- clean until the evening, and so afterwards shall be clean.
<br>But an earthen vessel, into which any of these shall fall, shall be defiled: and therefore is to be broken.
<br>Any meat which you eat, if water from such a vessel be poured upon it, shall be unclean; and every liquor that is drunk out of any such vessel, shall be unclean.
<br>And upon whatsoever thing any of these dead beasts shall fall, it shall be unclean. Whether it be oven, or pots with feet, they shall be destroyed, and shall be unclean.
<br>But fountains and cisterns, and all gather- ings together of waters shall be clean. He that toucheth their carcasses shall be defiled.
<br>If it fall upon seed corn, it shall not defile
<br>it.
<br>But if any man pour water upon the seed, and afterwards it be touched by the carcasses, it shall be forthwith defiled.
<br>If any beast die, of which it is lawful for you to eat, he that toucheth the carcass thereof, shall be unclean until the evening.
<br>And he that eateth or carrieth any thing thereof, shall wash his clothes, and shall be un- clean until the evening.
<br>All that creepeth upon the earth shall be abominable: neither shall it be taken for meat.
<br>Whatsoever goeth upon the breast on four feet, or hath many feet, or traileth on the earth, you shall not eat, because it is abominable.
<br>Do not defile your souls, nor touch aught thereof, lest you be unclean,
<br>For I am the Lord your God. Be holy be- cause I am holy. Defile not your souls by any creeping thing, that moveth upon the earth.
<br>For I am the Lord, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, that I might be your God.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>You shall be holy, because I am holy. This is the law of beasts and fowls, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and creepeth on the earth:
<br>That you may know the differences of the clean, and unclean, and know what you ought to eat, and what to refuse.
<br>
<br>Chapter 12
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: If a woman having received seed shall bear a man child, she shall be unclean seven days, according to the days of separation of her flowers.
<br>And on the eighth day the infant shall be circumcised:
<br>But she shall remain three and thirty days in the blood of her purification. She shall touch no holy thing: neither shall she enter into the sanctuary, until the days of her purification, be fulfilled.
<br>But if she shall bear a maid child, she shall be unclean two weeks, according to the custom of her monthly courses. And she shall remain in the blood of her purification sixty-six days.
<br>And when the days of her purification are expired, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring to the door of the tabernacle of the testi- mony, a lamb of a year old for a holocaust, and a young pigeon or a turtle for sin: and shall deliver them to the priest.
<br>Who shall offer them before the Lord, and shall pray for her: and so she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood. This is the law for her that beareth a man child or a maid child.
<br>And if her hand find not sufficiency, and she is not able to offer a lamb, she shall take two tur-
<br> 
<br>tles, or two young pigeons, one for a holocaust, and another for sin: and the priest shall pray for her, and so she shall be cleansed.
<br>
<br>Chapter 13
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying: 2 The man in whose skin or flesh shall arise a different colour or a blister, or as it were some- thing shining, that is the stroke of the leprosy, shall be brought to Aaron the priest, or any or
<br>of his sons.
<br>And if he see the leprosy in his skin, and the hair turned white and the place where the leprosy appears lower than the skin and the rest of the flesh: it is the stroke of the leprosy, and upon his judgment he shall be separated.
<br>But if there be a shining whiteness in the skin, and not lower than the other flesh, and the hair be of the former colour, the priest shall shut him up seven days.
<br>And the seventh day he shall look on him: and if the leprosy be grown no farther, and hath not spread itself in the skin, he shall shut him up again other seven days.
<br>And on the seventh day, he shall look on him. If the leprosy be somewhat obscure, and not spread in the skin, he shall declare him clean, because it is but a scab: and the man shall wash his clothes, and shall be clean.
<br>But, if the leprosy grow again, after he was seen by the priest and restored to cleanness, he shall be brought to him:
<br>And shall be condemned of uncleanness.
<br>If the stroke of the leprosy be in a man, he shall be brought to the priest:
<br>And he shall view him. And when there shall be a white colour in the skin, and it shall have changed the look of the hair, and the living
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>flesh itself shall appear:
<br>It shall be judged an inveterate leprosy, and grown into the skin. The priest therefore shall declare him unclean: and shall not shut him up, because he is evidently unclean.
<br>But if the leprosy spring out running about in the skin, and cover all the skin from the head to the feet, whatsoever falleth under the sight of the eyes:
<br>The priest shall view him, and shall judge that the leprosy which he has is very clean: be- cause it is all turned into whiteness, and there- fore the man shall be clean.
<br>But when the live flesh shall appear in him: 15 Then by the judgment of the priest he shall be defiled, and shall be reckoned among the un- clean. For live flesh, if it be spotted with leprosy,
<br>is unclean.
<br>And if again it be turned into whiteness, and cover all the man:
<br>The priest shall view him, and shall judge him to be clean.
<br>When also there has been an ulcer in the flesh and the skin, and it has been healed:
<br>And in the place of the ulcer, there ap- peareth a white scar, or somewhat red, the man shall be brought to the priest.
<br>And when he shall see the place of the leprosy lower than the other flesh, and the hair turned white: he shall declare him unclean, for the plague of leprosy is broken out in the ulcer. 21 But if the hair be of the former colour, and the scar somewhat obscure, and be not lower than the flesh that is near it: he shall shut him
<br>up seven days.
<br>And if it spread, he shall judge him to have the leprosy:
<br>But if it stay in its place, it is but the scar of an ulcer: and the man shall be clean.
<br> 
<br>The flesh also and skin that hath been burnt, and after it is healed hath a white or a red scar:
<br>The priest shall view it, and if he see it turned white, and the place thereof is lower than the other skin: he shall declare him unclean, be- cause the evil of leprosy is broken out in the scar. 26 But if the colour of the hair be not changed, nor the blemish lower than the other flesh, and the appearance of the leprosy be somewhat ob-
<br>scure: he shall shut him up seven days,
<br>And on the seventh day he shall view him. If the leprosy be grown farther in the skin, he shall declare him unclean.
<br>But if the whiteness stay in its place, and be not very clear, it is the sore of a burning: and therefore he shall be cleansed, because it is only the scar of a burning.
<br>If the leprosy break out in the head or the beard of a man or woman, the priest shall see them,
<br>And if the place be lower than the other flesh, and the hair yellow, and thinner than usual: he shall declare them unclean, because it is the leprosy of the head and the beard;
<br>But if he perceive the place of the spot is equal with the flesh that is near it, and the hair black: he shall shut him up seven days,
<br>And on the seventh day he shall look upon it. If the spot be not grown, and the hair keep its colour, and the place of the blemish be even with the other flesh:
<br>The man shall be shaven all but the place of the spot: and he shall be shut up other seven days.
<br>If on the seventh day the evil seem to have stayed in its place, and not lower than the other flesh, he shall cleanse him: and his clothes being washed he shall be clean.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>But if after his cleansing the spot spread again in the skin:
<br>He shall seek no more whether the hair be turned yellow, because he is evidently unclean.
<br>But if the spot be stayed, and the hair be black, let him know that the man is healed: and let him confidently pronounce him clean.
<br>If a whiteness appear in the skin of a man or a woman,
<br>The priest shall view them. If he find that a darkish whiteness shineth in the skin, let him know that it is not the leprosy, but a white blem- ish, and that the man is clean.
<br>The man whose hair falleth off from his head, he is bald and clean:
<br>And if the hair fall from his forehead, he is bald before and clean.
<br>But if in the bald head or in the bald fore- head there be risen a white or reddish colour:
<br>And the priest perceive this, he shall con- demn him undoubtedly of leprosy which is risen in the bald part.
<br>Now whosoever shall be defiled with the leprosy, and is separated by the judgment of the priest:
<br>Shall have his clothes hanging loose, his head bare, his mouth covered with a cloth: and he shall cry out that he is defiled and unclean.
<br>All the time that he is a leper and unclean he shall dwell alone without the camp.
<br>A woollen or linen garment that shall have the leprosy
<br>In the warp, and the woof: or skin, or what- soever is made of a skin:
<br>If it be infected with a white or red spot, it shall be accounted the leprosy, and shall be shewn to the priest.
<br>And he shall look upon it and shall shut it up seven days.
<br> 
<br>And on the seventh day when he looketh on it again, if he find that it is grown, it is a fixed leprosy. He shall judge the garment unclean, and every thing wherein it shall be found.
<br>And therefore it shall be burnt with fire.
<br>But if he see that it is not grown,
<br>He shall give orders, and they shall wash that part wherein the leprosy is: and he shall shut it up other seven days.
<br>And when he shall see that the former colour is not returned, nor yet the leprosy spread, he shall judge it unclean: and shall burn it with fire, for the leprosy has taken hold of the outside of the garment, or through the whole.
<br>But if the place of the leprosy be somewhat dark, after the garment is washed, he shall tear it off, and divide it from that which is sound.
<br>And if after this there appear in those places that before were without spot, a flying and wandering leprosy: it must be burnt with fire.
<br>If it cease, he shall wash with water the parts that are pure, the second time: and they shall be clean.
<br>This is the law touching the leprosy of any woollen or linen garment, either in the warp or woof, or any thing of skins: how it ought to be cleaned, or pronounced unclean.
<br>
<br>Chapter 14
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<br>This is the rite of a leper, when he is to be cleansed. He shall be brought to the priest:
<br>Who going out of the camp, when he shall find that the leprosy is cleansed,
<br>Shall command him that is to be purified, to offer for himself two living sparrows, which it is lawful to eat, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>hyssop.
<br>And he shall command one of the sparrows to be immolated in an earthen vessel over living waters.
<br>But the other that is alive, he shall dip, with the cedar wood, and the scarlet and the hyssop, in the blood of the sparrow that is immolated:
<br>Wherewith he shall sprinkle him that is to be cleansed seven times, that he may be rightly purified. And he shall let go the living sparrow, that it may fly into the field.
<br>And when the man hath washed his clothes, he shall shave all the hair of his body, and shall be washed with water: and being purified he shall enter into the camp, yet so that he tarry without his own tent seven days.
<br>And on the seventh day he shall shave the hair of his head, and his beard and his eyebrows, and the hair of all his body. And having washed again his clothes, and his body,
<br>On the eighth day, he shall take two lambs without blemish, and an ewe of a year old with- out blemish, and three tenths of flour tempered with oil for a sacrifice, and a sextary of oil apart.
<br>And when the priest that purifieth the man, hath presented him, and all these things before the Lord, at the door of the tabernacle of the testimony:
<br>He shall take a lamb, and offer it for a trespass offering with the sextary of oil. And having offered all before the Lord,
<br>He shall immolate the lamb, where the vic- tim for sin is wont to be immolated, and the holocaust, that is, in the holy place. For as that which is for sin, so also the victim for a tres- pass offering pertaineth to the priest: it is holy of holies.
<br>And the priest taking of the blood of the victim that was immolated for trespass, shall put it upon  the tip of  the right ear of him  that is
<br> 
<br>cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand and the great toe of his right foot.
<br>And he shall pour of the sextary of oil into his own left hand,
<br>And shall dip his right finger in it, and sprinkle it before the Lord seven times.
<br>And the rest of the oil in his left hand, he shall pour upon the tip of the right ear of him that is cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand and the great toe of his right foot, and upon the blood that was shed for trespass:
<br>And upon his head.
<br>And he shall pray for him before the Lord, and shall offer the sacrifice for sin. Then shall he immolate the holocaust.
<br>And put it on the altar with the libations thereof: and the man shall be rightly cleansed.
<br>But if he be poor, and his hand cannot find the things aforesaid: he shall take a lamb for an offering for trespass, that the priest may pray for him, and a tenth part of flour tempered with oil for a sacrifice, and a sextary of oil:
<br>And two turtles or two young pigeons, of which one may be for sin, and the other for a holocaust.
<br>And he shall offer them on the eighth day of his purification to the priest, at the door of the tabernacle of the testimony before the Lord. 24 And the priest receiving the lamb for tres- pass, and the sextary of oil, shall elevate them
<br>together.
<br>And the lamb being immolated, he shall put of the blood thereof upon the tip of the right ear of him that is cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and the great toe of his right foot.
<br>But he shall pour part of the oil into his own left hand,
<br>And dipping the finger of his right hand in it, he shall sprinkle it seven times before the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Lord.
<br>And he shall touch the tip of the right ear of him  that is  cleansed, and the thumb  of his right hand and the great toe of his right foot, in the place of the blood that was shed for trespass. 29 And the other part of the oil that is in his left hand, he  shall pour upon the head of  the purified person, that he may appease the Lord
<br>for him.
<br>And he shall offer a turtle, or young pigeon:
<br>One for trespass, and the other for a holo- caust, with their libations.
<br>This is the sacrifice of a leper, that is not able to have all things that appertain to his cleansing.
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:
<br>When you shall come into the land of Chanaan, which I will give you for a possession, if there be the plague or leprosy in a house:
<br>He whose house it is, shall go and tell the priest, saying: It seemeth to me, that there is the plague of leprosy in my house,
<br>And he shall command, that they carry forth all things out of the house, before he go into it, and see whether it have the leprosy, let all things become unclean that are in the house. And afterwards he shall go in to view the leprosy of the house.
<br>And if he see in the walls thereof as it were little dints, disfigured with paleness or redness, and lower than all he rest:
<br>He shall go out of the door of the house, and forthwith shut it up seven days,
<br>And returning on the seventh day, he shall look upon it. If he find that the leprosy is spread, 40 He shall command, that the stones wherein the leprosy is, be taken out, and cast without the
<br>city into an unclean place:
<br> 
<br>And that the house be scraped on the in- side round about, and the dust of the scrapings be scattered without the city into an unclean place:
<br>And that other stones be laid in the place of them that were taken away, and the house be plastered with other mortar.
<br>But if after the stones be taken out, and the dust scraped off, and it be plastered with other earth.
<br>The priest going in perceive that the lep- rosy is returned, and the walls full of spots, it is a lasting leprosy, and the house is unclean.
<br>And they shall destroy it forthwith, and shall cast the stones and timber thereof, and all the dust without the town into an unclean place. 46 He that entereth into the house when it is
<br>shut, shall be unclean until evening,
<br>And he that sleepeth in it, and eateth any thing, shall wash his clothes.
<br>But if the priest going in perceive that the leprosy is not spread in the house, after it was plastered again, he shall purify it, it being cured. 49 And for the purification thereof he shall take two sparrows, and cedar wood, and scarlet,
<br>and hyssop.
<br>And having immolated one sparrow in an earthen vessel, over living waters,
<br>He shall take the cedar wood, and the hys- sop, and the scarlet, and the living sparrow, and shall dip all in the blood of the sparrow that is immolated, and in the living water: and he shall sprinkle the house seven times.
<br>And shall purify it as well with the blood of the sparrow, as with the living water, and with the living sparrow, and with the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet.
<br>And when he hath let go the sparrow to fly freely away into the field, he shall pray for the house: and it shall be rightly cleansed.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>This is the law of every kind of leprosy and stroke.
<br>Of the leprosy of garments and houses,
<br>Of a scar and of blisters breaking out of a shining spot, and when the colours are diversely changed:
<br>That it may be known when a thing is clean or unclean.
<br>
<br>Chapter 15
<br>
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying: 2 Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: The man that hath an issue of seed, shall
<br>be unclean.
<br>And then shall he be judged subject to this evil, when a filthy humour, at every moment, cleaveth to his flesh, and gathereth there.
<br>Every bed on which he sleepeth, shall be unclean, and every place on which he sitteth.
<br>If any man touch his bed, he shall wash his clothes and being washed with water, he shall be unclean until the evening.
<br>If a man sit where that man hath sitten, he also shall wash his clothes: and being washed with water, shall be unclean until the evening.
<br>He that toucheth his flesh, shall wash his clothes: and being himself washed with water shall be unclean until the evening.
<br>If such a man cast his spittle upon him that is clean, he shall wash his clothes: and being washed with water, he shall be unclean until the evening.
<br>The saddle on which he hath sitten shall be unclean.
<br>And whatsoever has been under him that hath the issue of seed, shall be unclean until the evening. He that carrieth any of these things,
<br> 
<br>shall wash his clothes: and being washed with water, he shall be unclean until the evening.
<br>Every person whom such a one shall touch, not having washed his hands before, shall wash his clothes: and being washed with water, shall be unclean until the evening.
<br>If he touch a vessel of earth, it shall be broken: but if a vessel of wood, it shall be washed with water.
<br>If he who suffereth this disease be healed, he shall number seven days after his cleansing: and having washed his clothes, and all his body in living water, he shall be clean.
<br>And on the eighth day he shall take two turtles, or two young pigeons, and he shall come before the Lord, to the door of the tabernacle of the testimony, and shall give them to the priest. 15 Who shall offer one for sin, and the other for a holocaust: and he shall pray for him before the Lord, that he may be cleansed of the issue
<br>of his seed.
<br>The man from whom the seed of copulation goeth out, shall wash all his body with water: and he shall be unclean until the evening.
<br>The garment or skin that he weareth, he shall wash with water: and it shall be unclean until the evening.
<br>The woman, with whom he copulateth, shall be washed with water: and shall be unclean until the evening.
