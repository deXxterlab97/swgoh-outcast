<br>§4100. Scope and limitation of chapter
<br>
<br>(a) The provisions of this chapter relating to the transfer of offenders shall be applicable only when a treaty providing for such a transfer is in force, and shall only be applicable to transfers of offenders to and from a foreign country pursuant to such a treaty. A sentence imposed by a foreign country upon an offender who is subsequently transferred to the United States pursuant to a treaty shall be subject to being fully executed in the United States even though the treaty under which the offender was transferred is no longer in force.
<br>
<br>(b) An offender may be transferred from the United States pursuant to this chapter only to a country of which the offender is a citizen or national. Only an offender who is a citizen or national of the United States may be transferred to the United States. An offender may be transferred to or from the United States only with the offender's consent, and only if the offense for which the offender was sentenced satisfies the requirement of double criminality as defined in this chapter. Once an offender's consent to transfer has been verified by a verifying officer, that consent shall be irrevocable. If at the time of transfer the offender is under eighteen years of age, or is deemed by the verifying officer to be mentally incompetent or otherwise incapable of knowingly and voluntarily consenting to the transfer, the transfer shall not be accomplished unless consent to the transfer be given by a parent or guardian, guardian ad litem, or by an appropriate court of the sentencing country. The appointment of a guardian ad litem shall be independent of the appointment of counsel under section 4109 of this title.
<br>
<br>(c) An offender shall not be transferred to or from the United States if a proceeding by way of appeal or of collateral attack upon the conviction or sentence be pending.
<br>
<br>(d) The United States upon receiving notice from the country which imposed the sentence that the offender has been granted a pardon, commutation, or amnesty, or that there has been an ameliorating modification or a revocation of the sentence shall give the offender the benefit of the action taken by the sentencing country.

<br>Prisoner Transfer Treaties
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 104–208, div. C, title III, §330, Sept. 30, 1996, 110 Stat. 3009–631, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(a) Negotiations With Other Countries.—(1) Congress advises the President to begin to negotiate and renegotiate, not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act [Sept. 30, 1996], bilateral prisoner transfer treaties, providing for the incarceration, in the country of the alien's nationality, of any alien who—
<br>
<br>"(A) is a national of a country that is party to such a treaty; and
<br>
<br>"(B) has been convicted of a criminal offense under Federal or State law and who—
<br>
<br>"(i) is not in lawful immigration status in the United States, or
<br>
<br>"(ii) on the basis of conviction for a criminal offense under Federal or State law, or on any other basis, is subject to deportation or removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act [8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.],
<br>
<br>for the duration of the prison term to which the alien was sentenced for the offense referred to in subparagraph (B). Any such agreement may provide for the release of such alien pursuant to parole procedures of that country.
<br>
<br>"(2) In entering into negotiations under paragraph (1), the President may consider providing for appropriate compensation, subject to the availability of appropriations, in cases where the United States is able to independently verify the adequacy of the sites where aliens will be imprisoned and the length of time the alien is actually incarcerated in the foreign country under such a treaty.
<br>
<br>"(b) Sense of Congress.—It is the sense of the Congress that—
<br>
<br>"(1) the focus of negotiations for such agreements should be—
<br>
<br>"(A) to expedite the transfer of aliens unlawfully in the United States who are (or are about to be) incarcerated in United States prisons,
<br>
<br>"(B) to ensure that a transferred prisoner serves the balance of the sentence imposed by the United States courts,
<br>
<br>"(C) to eliminate any requirement of prisoner consent to such a transfer, and
<br>
<br>"(D) to allow the Federal Government or the States to keep their original prison sentences in force so that transferred prisoners who return to the United States prior to the completion of their original United States sentences can be returned to custody for the balance of their prisons [sic] sentences;
<br>
<br>"(2) the Secretary of State should give priority to concluding an agreement with any country for which the President determines that the number of aliens described in subsection (a) who are nationals of that country in the United States represents a significant percentage of all such aliens in the United States; and
<br>
<br>"(3) no new treaty providing for the transfer of aliens from Federal, State, or local incarceration facilities to a foreign incarceration facility should permit the alien to refuse the transfer.
<br>
<br>"(c) Prisoner Consent.—Notwithstanding any other provision of law, except as required by treaty, the transfer of an alien from a Federal, State, or local incarceration facility under an agreement of the type referred to in subsection (a) shall not require consent of the alien.
<br>
<br>"(d) Annual Report.—Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act [Sept. 30, 1996], and annually thereafter, the Attorney General shall submit a report to the Committees on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and of the Senate stating whether each prisoner transfer treaty to which the United States is a party has been effective in the preceding 12 months in bringing about the return of deportable incarcerated aliens to the country of which they are nationals and in ensuring that they serve the balance of their sentences.
<br>
<br>"(e) Training Foreign Law Enforcement Personnel.—(1) Subject to paragraph (2), the President shall direct the Border Patrol Academy and the Customs Service Academy to enroll for training an appropriate number of foreign law enforcement personnel, and shall make appointments of foreign law enforcement personnel to such academies, as necessary to further the following United States law enforcement goals:
<br>
<br>"(A) Preventing of drug smuggling and other cross-border criminal activity.
<br>
<br>"(B) Preventing illegal immigration.
<br>
<br>"(C) Preventing the illegal entry of goods into the United States (including goods the sale of which is illegal in the United States, the entry of which would cause a quota to be exceeded, or the appropriate duty or tariff for which has not been paid).
<br>
<br>"(2) The appointments described in paragraph (1) shall be made only to the extent there is capacity in such academies beyond what is required to train United States citizens needed in the Border Patrol and Customs Service, and only of personnel from a country with which the prisoner transfer treaty has been stated to be effective in the most recent report referred to in subsection (d).
<br>
<br>"(f) Authorization of Appropriations.—There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out this section."
<br>
<br>[For transfer of functions, personnel, assets, and liabilities of the United States Customs Service of the Department of the Treasury, including functions of the Secretary of the Treasury relating thereto, to the Secretary of Homeland Security, and for treatment of related references, see sections 203(1), 551(d), 552(d), and 557 of Title 6, Domestic Security, and the Department of Homeland Security Reorganization Plan of November 25, 2002, as modified, set out as a note under section 542 of Title 6.

<br>(A) The corporation shall prepare a detailed written analysis of the probable impact on industry and free labor of the plans for new production or expanded production. In such written analysis the corporation shall, at a minimum, identify and consider—
<br>
<br>(i) the number of vendors currently meeting the requirements of the Federal Government for the product;
<br>
<br>(ii) the proportion of the Federal Government market for the product currently served by small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, or businesses operating in labor surplus areas;
<br>
<br>(iii) the size of the Federal Government and non-Federal Government markets for the product;
<br>
<br>(iv) the projected growth in the Federal Government demand for the product; and
<br>
<br>(v) the projected ability of the Federal Government market to sustain both Federal Prison Industries and private vendors.
<br>
<br>(B) The corporation shall announce in a publication designed to most effectively provide notice to potentially affected private vendors the plans to produce any new product or to significantly expand production of an existing product. The announcement shall also indicate that the analysis prepared under subparagraph (A) is available through the corporation and shall invite comments from private industry regarding the new production or expanded production.
<br>
<br>(C) The corporation shall directly advise those affected trade associations that the corporation can reasonably identify the plans for new production or expanded production, and the corporation shall invite such trade associations to submit comments on those plans.
<br>
<br>(D) The corporation shall provide to the board of directors—
<br>
<br>(i) the analysis prepared under subparagraph (A) on the proposal to produce a new product or to significantly expand the production of an existing product,
<br>
<br>(ii) comments submitted to the corporation on the proposal, and
<br>
<br>(iii) the corporation's recommendations for action on the proposal in light of such comments.
<br>
<br>In addition, the board of directors, before making a final decision under this paragraph on a proposal, shall, upon the request of an established trade association or other interested representatives of private industry, provide a reasonable opportunity to such trade association or other representatives to present comments directly to the board of directors on the proposal.
<br>
<br>(5) Federal Prison Industries shall publish in the manner specified in paragraph (4)(B) the final decision of the board with respect to the production of a new product or the significant expansion of the production of an existing product.
<br>
<br>(6) Federal Prison Industries shall publish, after the end of each 6-month period, a list of sales by the corporation for that 6-month period. Such list shall be made available to all interested parties.
<br>
<br>(c) Its board of directors may provide for the vocational training of qualified inmates without regard to their industrial or other assignments.
<br>
<br>(d)(1) The provisions of this chapter shall apply to the industrial employment and training of prisoners convicted by general courts-martial and confined in any institution under the jurisdiction of any department or agency comprising the Department of Defense, to the extent and under terms and conditions agreed upon by the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General and the Board of Directors of Federal Prison Industries.
<br>
<br>(2) Any department or agency of the Department of Defense may, without exchange of funds, transfer to Federal Prison Industries any property or equipment suitable for use in performing the functions and duties covered by agreement entered into under paragraph (1) of this subsection.
<br>
<br>(e)(1) The provisions of this chapter shall apply to the industrial employment and training of prisoners confined in any penal or correctional institution under the direction of the Commissioner of the District of Columbia to the extent and under terms and conditions agreed upon by the Commissioner, the Attorney General, and the Board of Directors of Federal Prison Industries.
<br>
<br>(2) The Commissioner of the District of Columbia may, without exchange of funds, transfer to the Federal Prison Industries any property or equipment suitable for use in performing the functions and duties covered by an agreement entered into under subsection (e)(1) of this section.
<br>
<br>(3) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to affect the provisions of the Act approved October 3, 1964 (D.C. Code, sections 24–451 et seq.), entitled "An Act to establish in the Treasury a correctional industries fund for the government of the District of Columbia, and for other purposes."

<br>
<br>A part of said section 744c of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., is incorporated in section 4122 of this title.
<br>
<br>References to the Attorney General were omitted because section 744k of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., as originally enacted, provided for the transfer to Federal Prison Industries of the powers and duties then vested in the Attorney General.
<br>
<br>References to "this chapter" were substituted for "this section" since the general authority to establish and supervise prison industries is contained in this chapter.
<br>
<br>Minor changes of phraseology were made.
<br>§4124. Purchase of prison-made products by Federal departments
<br>
<br>(a) The several Federal departments and agencies and all other Government institutions of the United States shall purchase at not to exceed current market prices, such products of the industries authorized by this chapter as meet their requirements and may be available.
<br>
<br>(b) Disputes as to the price, quality, character, or suitability of such products shall be arbitrated by a board consisting of the Attorney General, the Administrator of General Services, and the President, or their representatives. Their decision shall be final and binding upon all parties.

Each report published by the Federal Procurement Data System that contains the information collected by the System shall include a statement to accompany the information reported by the department, agency, or institution under the preceding sentence as follows: "Under current law, sales by Federal Prison Industries are considered intragovernmental transfers. The purpose of reporting sales by Federal Prison Industries is to provide a complete overview of acquisitions by the Federal Government during the reporting period.".
<br>
<br>(d) Within 90 days after the date of the enactment of this subsection, Federal Prison Industries shall publish a catalog of all products and services which it offers for sale.

<br>Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §744g (May 27, 1930, ch. 340, §7, 46 Stat. 392).
<br>
<br>The revised section substituted the Director of the Bureau of Federal Supply of the Treasury Department for the General Supply Committee, the functions of the latter having been transferred to the Procurement Division of the Treasury Department by Executive Order No. 6166, §1, June 10, 1933, and the name of that unit having been changed to Bureau of Federal Supply by order of the Secretary of the Treasury effective January 1, 1947, 11 Federal Register No. 13,638. The Bureau of the Budget was substituted for the Bureau of Efficiency which was abolished by Act of March 3, 1933, ch. 212, §17, 47 Stat. 1519, without transferring its functions elsewhere. However, the Bureau of the Budget performs similar duties and its Director logically should serve on the arbitration board.
<br>
<br>Reference to authority for appropriations was omitted and words "by this chapter" substituted therefor.
<br>
<br>The word "agencies" was substituted for "independent establishments" to avoid any possibility of ambiguity. See definition of "agency" in section 6 of this title.

<br>
<br>Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§744b, 851, 853, 854, 855 (Feb. 26, 1929, ch. 336, §§1, 3, 4, 5, 45 Stat. 1318; May 27, 1930, ch. 340, §2, 46 Stat. 391).
<br>
<br>Section consolidates section 744b of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with those portions of sections 851, 853–855 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which may not have been superseded by section 744b of said title.
<br>
<br>Section 851 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., was superseded except for the proviso which formed the basis for the added words "elsewhere than upon Indian reservations".
<br>
<br>Section 855 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., was superseded by section 744b of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., except as to the specific mention in section 855 of said title of expense for maintenance and operation of camps. Hence a reference to operation was added in subsection (c) of this section.
<br>
<br>Section 854 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., was added as a part of subsection (c).
<br>
<br>Section 853 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., was added as subsection (d) of this section, although its retention may be unnecessary.
<br>
<br>The phrase "the cost of which is borne exclusively by the United States" which followed the words "constructing or repairing roads" was omitted as inconsistent with the later phrase "constructing or repairing any other public ways or works financed wholly or in major part by funds appropriated from the Treasury of the United States."
<br>
<br>The provision for transfer of prisoners was omitted as duplicitous of a similar provision in section 4082 of this title.
<br>
<br>Other changes of phraseology were made.
<br>§4126. Prison Industries Fund; use and settlement of accounts
<br>
<br>(a) All moneys under the control of Federal Prison Industries, or received from the sale of the products or by-products of such Industries, or for the services of federal prisoners, shall be deposited or covered into the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the Prison Industries Fund and withdrawn therefrom only pursuant to accountable warrants or certificates of settlement issued by the Government Accountability Office.
<br>
<br>(b) All valid claims and obligations payable out of said fund shall be assumed by the corporation.
<br>
<br>(c) The corporation, in accordance with the laws generally applicable to the expenditures of the several departments, agencies, and establishments of the Government, is authorized to employ the fund, and any earnings that may accrue to the corporation—
<br>
<br>(1) as operating capital in performing the duties imposed by this chapter;
<br>
<br>(2) in the lease, purchase, other acquisition, repair, alteration, erection, and maintenance of industrial buildings and equipment;
<br>
<br>(3) in the vocational training of inmates without regard to their industrial or other assignments;
<br>
<br>(4) in paying, under rules and regulations promulgated by the Attorney General, compensation to inmates employed in any industry, or performing outstanding services in institutional operations, not less than 15 percent of such compensation for any inmate shall be reserved in the fund or a separate account and made available to assist the inmate with costs associated with release from prison, and compensation to inmates or their dependents for injuries suffered in any industry or in any work activity in connection with the maintenance or operation of the institution in which the inmates are confined.
<br>
<br>In no event may compensation for such injuries be paid in an amount greater than that provided in chapter 81 of title 5.
<br>
<br>(d) Accounts of all receipts and disbursements of the corporation shall be rendered to the Government Accountability Office for settlement and adjustment, as required by the Comptroller General.
<br>
<br>(e) Such accounting shall include all fiscal transactions of the corporation, whether involving appropriated moneys, capital, or receipts from other sources.
<br>
<br>(f) Funds available to the corporation may be used for the lease, purchase, other acquisition, repair, alteration, erection, or maintenance of facilities only to the extent such facilities are necessary for the industrial operations of the corporation under this chapter. Such funds may not be used for the construction or acquisition of penal or correctional institutions, including camps described in section 4125.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>1948 Act
<br>
<br>Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§744d, 744e, 744f, 744l (May 27, 1930, ch. 340, §§4–6, 46 Stat. 391, 392; June 23, 1934, ch. 736, §4, 48 Stat. 1211).
<br>
<br>This section is a restatement of section 744l of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with which sections 744d and 744f and the first sentence of section 744e of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are consolidated, in view of the fact that those provisions have been superseded by section 744l of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., in connection with other provisions of the act of June 23, 1934, ch. 736, 48 Stat. 1211.
<br>
<br>The first sentence of section 744l of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., authorizing replacement of the prison industries working capital fund by the prison industries fund was omitted, as executed. That provision superseded section 744d of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which authorized creation of the prison industries working capital fund and the first sentence of section 744e of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., directing that certain funds should be credited to the consolidated prison industries working capital fund.
<br>
<br>The phrase "or received from the sale of the products or by-products of such Industries, or for the services of Federal prisoners," was inserted to make the first paragraph of this section complete, and required the Federal Prison Industries to account for all moneys under its control.
<br>
<br>The words "in the repair, alteration, erection and maintenance of industrial buildings and equipment" and "under rules and regulations promulgated by the Attorney General in paying compensation to inmates employed in any industry, or performing outstanding services in industrial operations" were inserted in part to conform to administrative construction, and in part to provide greater flexibility in the operation of Prison Industries. Much friction was caused by the inability of Prison Industries to compensate inmates whose services in operating the utilities of the institution were most necessary but which were uncompensated while those prisoners who worked in the Industries received compensation. This inequitable situation is corrected by the revised section.
<br>
<br>The words "in performing the duties imposed by this chapter" were substituted for the words "for the purposes enumerated in sections 744a–744h of this title," since the provisions with regard to prison industries now appear in this chapter. The general provisions as to use of the fund supersede the more specific provisions of section 744f of said title (enacted earlier).
<br>
<br>A reference to the Federal Employees' Compensation Act as appeared in the 1934 act was substituted for the reference to specific sections of title 5. The word "law" was substituted for the reference to sections in title 31 since translation of the reference in the 1934 act was not practicable.
<br>
<br>Remaining provisions of said section 744e of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to authorization of appropriations, were omitted as unnecessary.
<br>
<br>Other changes in phraseology were made.
<br>1949 Act
<br>
<br>This section [section 64] incorporates in section 4126 of title 18, U.S.C., provisions of act of May 11, 1948 (ch. 276, 62 Stat. 230), which was not incorporated in title 18 when the revision was enacted. The remainder of such act is incorporated in section 4122 of such title by another section of this bill.

<br>Termination of Reporting Requirements
<br>
<br>For termination, effective May 15, 2000, of reporting provisions in this section, see section 3003 of Pub. L. 104–66, as amended, set out as a note under section 1113 of Title 31, Money and Finance, and page 117 of House Document No. 103–7.

<br>
<br>In the event of any failure of Federal Prison Industries to act, the Attorney General shall not be limited in carrying out the duties conferred upon him by law.
<br>
<br>(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 853.)
<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §744n (June 23, 1934, ch. 736, §6, 48 Stat. 1212).
<br>
<br>Phrase relating to section being "supplemental" to sections 744i–744h of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., is omitted as unnecessary.
<br>
<br>Retention of remainder of section is essential to insure authority of Attorney General to require performance of duties of Prison Industries. (See sections 4001 and 4003 of this title.) This is also consistent with 1939 Reorganization Plan No. II, §3(a), transferring the corporation to the Department of Justice "under the general direction and supervision of the Attorney General". (See section 133t of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees.)
<br>
<br>Words "Federal Prison Industries" were substituted for "the corporation".
<br>§4129. Authority to borrow and invest
<br>
<br>(a)(1) As approved by the board of directors, Federal Prison Industries, to such extent and in such amounts as are provided in appropriations Acts, is authorized to issue its obligations to the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Secretary of the Treasury, in the Secretary's discretion, may purchase or agree to purchase any such obligations, except that the aggregate amount of obligations issued by Federal Prison Industries under this paragraph that are outstanding at any time may not exceed 25 percent of the net worth of the corporation. For purchases of such obligations by the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary is authorized to use as a public debt transaction the proceeds of the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31 after the date of the enactment of this section, and the purposes for which securities may be issued under that chapter are extended to include such purchases. Each purchase of obligations by the Secretary of the Treasury under this subsection shall be upon such terms and conditions as to yield a return at a rate not less than a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturity. For purposes of the first sentence of this paragraph, the net worth of Federal Prison Industries is the amount by which its assets (including capital) exceed its liabilities.
<br>
<br>(2) The Secretary of the Treasury may sell, upon such terms and conditions and at such price or prices as the Secretary shall determine, any of the obligations acquired by the Secretary under this subsection. All purchases and sales by the Secretary of the Treasury of such obligations under this subsection shall be treated as public debt transactions of the United States.
<br>
<br>(b) Federal Prison Industries may request the Secretary of the Treasury to invest excess moneys from the Prison Industries Fund. Such investments shall be in public debt securities with maturities suitable to the needs of the corporation as determined by the board of directors, and bearing interest at rates determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration current market yields on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturities.
