<br>
<br>The authorization is restated to conform to the style of this title. The word "Executive agency" are substituted for "executive department, independent establishment" in view of the definitions in sections 103, 104, and 105. The source statute (an act to authorize the appointment of employees in the executive branch etc.) applied to the entire executive branch, and government corporations as well as other agencies in the executive branch were included within the words "independent establishment". The words "or a military department" are inserted to preserve the application of the source statute. Before enactment of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (63 Stat. 578), the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force were Executive departments. The National Security Act Amendments of 1949 established the Department of Defense as an Executive department including the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force as military departments, not as Executive departments. However, the source statute for this subsection, which was in effect in 1949, remained applicable to the Secretaries of the military departments by virtue of section 12(g) of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (63 Stat. 591), which is set out in the reviser's note for section 301. The words "for services in the District of Columbia or elsewhere" are eliminated as surplusage. The reference to chapter 51 is substituted for the reference to the Classification Act of 1923 because the Act of Oct. 28, 1949, ch. 782, §1106(a), 63 Stat. 972, amended the section to refer to the Classification Act of 1949, which is carried into this title. The proviso in former section 43 and former section 514d (2d par.) are omitted as superseded by former section 22a, which is carried into section 302. The last sentence of the Act of June 26, 1930, is omitted as executed.

<br>This section was part of title IV of the Revised Statutes. The Act of July 26, 1947, ch. 343, §201(d), as added Aug. 10, 1949, ch. 412, §4, 63 Stat. 579 (former 5 U.S.C. 171–1), which provides "Except to the extent inconsistent with the provisions of this Act [National Security Act of 1947], the provisions of title IV of the Revised Statutes as now or hereafter amended shall be applicable to the Department of Defense" is omitted from this title but is not repealed.

<br>Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.

<br>
<br>(b)(1) The head of each agency may employ one or more personal assistants who the head of the agency determines are necessary to enable a handicapped employee of that agency to perform the employee's official duties and who shall serve without pay from the agency, without regard to—

<br>
<br>Sept. 2, 1958, Pub. L. 85–861, §7(b), 72 Stat. 1555.
<br>
<br>Sections 189 and 365 of the Revised Statutes, as amended, are combined and the section is revised to express the effect of the law since department heads have long employed, with the approval of Congress, attorneys to advise them in the conduct of their official duties. The law which concentrates the authority for the conduct of litigation in the Department of Justice is codified in section 516 of title 28 by this bill.
<br>
<br>The words "Executive department" are substituted for "department" as the definition of "department" applicable to R.S. §189 is coextensive with the definition of "Executive department" in section 101. The words "or military department" are inserted to preserve the application of the source law. Before enactment of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (63 Stat. 578), the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force were Executive departments. The National Security Act Amendments of 1949 established the Department of Defense as an Executive Department including the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force as military departments, not as Executive departments. However, the source law for this section, which was in effect in 1949, remained applicable to the Secretaries of the military departments by virtue of section 12(g) of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (63 Stat. 591), which is set out in the reviser's note for section 301.
<br>
<br>R.S. §189 was part of title IV of the Revised Statutes. The Act of July 26, 1947, ch. 343, §201(d), as added Aug. 1, 1949, ch. 412, §4, 63 Stat. 579 (former 5 U.S.C. 171–1), which provides "Except to the extent inconsistent with the provisions of this Act [National Security Act of 1947], the provisions of title IV of the Revised Statutes as now or hereafter amended shall be applicable to the Department of Defense" is omitted from this title but is not repealed.
<br>
<br>Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.
<br>§3107. Employment of publicity experts; restrictions
<br>
<br>Appropriated funds may not be used to pay a publicity expert unless specifically appropriated for that purpose.

<br>§3109. Employment of experts and consultants; temporary or intermittent
<br>
<br>(a) For the purpose of this section—
<br>
<br>(1) "agency" has the meaning given it by section 5721 of this title; and
<br>
<br>(2) "appropriation" includes funds made available by statute under section 9104 of title 31.
<br>
<br>(b) When authorized by an appropriation or other statute, the head of an agency may procure by contract the temporary (not in excess of 1 year) or intermittent services of experts or consultants or an organization thereof, including stenographic reporting services. Services procured under this section are without regard to—
<br>
<br>(1) the provisions of this title governing appointment in the competitive service;
<br>
<br>(2) chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of this title; and
<br>
<br>(3) section 6101(b) to (d) of title 41, except in the case of stenographic reporting services by an organization.
<br>
<br>However, an agency subject to chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of this title may pay a rate for services under this section in excess of the daily equivalent of the highest rate payable under section 5332 of this title only when specifically authorized by the appropriation or other statute authorizing the procurement of the services.
<br>
<br>(c) Positions in the Senior Executive Service or the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Drug Enforcement Administration Senior Executive Service may not be filled under the authority of subsection (b) of this section.
<br>
<br>(d) The Office of Personnel Management shall prescribe regulations necessary for the administration of this section. Such regulations shall include—
<br>
<br>(1) criteria governing the circumstances in which it is appropriate to employ an expert or consultant under the provisions of this section;
<br>
<br>(2) criteria for setting the pay of experts and consultants under this section; and
<br>
<br>(3) provisions to ensure compliance with such regulations.
<br>
<br>(e) Each agency shall report to the Office of Personnel Management on an annual basis with respect to—
<br>
<br>(1) the number of days each expert or consultant employed by the agency during the period was so employed; and
<br>
<br>(2) the total amount paid by the agency to each expert and consultant for such work during the period.
