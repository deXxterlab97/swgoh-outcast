<br>(a) Congressional findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) the forced transportation of elementary and secondary school students in implementation of the constitutional requirement for the desegregation of such schools is controversial and difficult under the best planning and administration; and
<br>
<br>(2) the forced transportation of elementary and secondary school students after the commencement of an academic school year is educationally unsound and administratively inefficient.
<br>(b) Student transportation orders incidental to student transfers pursuant to school desegregation plans effective beginning with academic school year
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, no order of a court, department, or agency of the United States, requiring the transportation of any student incident to the transfer of that student from one elementary or secondary school to another such school in a local educational agency pursuant to a plan requiring such transportation for the racial desegregation of any school in that agency, shall be effective until the beginning of an academic school year.
<br>(c) "Academic school year" defined
<br>
<br>For the purpose of this section, the term "academic school year" means, pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Secretary, the customary beginning of classes for the school year at an elementary or secondary school of a local educational agency for a school year that occurs not more often than once in any twelve-month period.
<br>(d) Orders subject to provisions of section
<br>

<br>§1758. Reasonable time for developing voluntary school desegregation plans following detailed notice of violations
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other law or provision of law, no court or officer of the United States shall enter, as a remedy for a denial of equal educational opportunity or a denial of equal protection of the laws, any order for enforcement of a plan of desegregation or modification of a court-approved plan, until such time as the local educational agency to be affected by such order has been provided notice of the details of the violation and given a reasonable opportunity to develop a voluntary remedial plan. Such time shall permit the local educational agency sufficient opportunity for community participation in the development of a remedial plan.

<br>
<br>because of the desirability of encouraging young people to recognize and provide service in the highest and best traditions of the American political system at all levels of government, it is especially appropriate to honor former President Harry S Truman through the creation of a perpetual education scholarship program to develop increased opportunities for young Americans to prepare and pursue careers in public service.

<br>SUBCHAPTER I—GENERAL PROVISIONS
<br>§2101. Congressional declaration of findings and purpose
<br>
<br>(a) The Congress hereby finds and declares—
<br>
<br>(1) that the diversity inherent in American folklife has contributed greatly to the cultural richness of the Nation and has fostered a sense of individuality and identity among the American people;
<br>
<br>(2) that the history of the United States effectively demonstrates that building a strong nation does not require the sacrifice of cultural differences;
<br>
<br>(3) that American folklife has a fundamental influence on the desires, beliefs, values, and character of the American people;
<br>
<br>(4) that it is appropriate and necessary for the Federal Government to support research and scholarship in American folklife in order to contribute to an understanding of the complex problems of the basic desires, beliefs, and values of the American people in both rural and urban areas;
<br>
<br>(5) that the encouragement and support of American folklife, while primarily a matter for private and local initiative, is also an appropriate matter of concern to the Federal Government; and
<br>
<br>(6) that it is in the interest of the general welfare of the Nation to preserve, support, revitalize, and disseminate American folklife traditions and arts.
<br>
<br>(b) It is therefore the purpose of this subchapter to establish in the Library of Congress an American Folklife Center to preserve and present American folklife.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 94–201, §2, Jan. 2, 1976, 89 Stat. 1129.)
<br>Short Title of 2016 Amendment

<br>Findings and Purpose of 1998 Amendment
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 105–275, title III, §312(a), Oct. 21, 1998, 112 Stat. 2457, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(1) Findings.—Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>"(A) The American Folklife Center in the Library of Congress was created by Congress in 1976, building on the vast expertise and archival material existing at the Library since 1928.
<br>
<br>"(B) As an instrumentality of the Congress, it is fitting that the American Folklife Center should have a direct and close relationship with the representatives of the people, who are best able to oversee the ongoing activities of the Center to preserve and promote the cultural traditions of the people, and to ensure that the resources of the Center be readily available to all Americans.
<br>
<br>"(C) In over 20 years since its creation, the American Folklife Center in the Library of Congress has—
<br>
<br>"(i) increased the size of the Archive of Folk Culture from 500,000 to 1,500,000 multi-format ethnographic items;
<br>
<br>"(ii) engaged in 15 cultural surveys and field documentation projects in all regions of the country;
<br>
<br>"(iii) provided publications, documentary equipment on loan, and advisory and reference service to persons and institutions in all 50 States;
<br>
<br>"(iv) produced exhibitions and other educational programs on American Folklife at the Library and around the country;
<br>
<br>"(v) begun sharing its unique collections in digital form via the Internet; and
<br>
<br>"(vi) served as a national center for the professions of folklore, ethnomusicology, and cultural studies.
<br>
<br>"(D) Congress has consistently provided encouragement and support of American Folklife as an appropriate matter of concern to the Federal Government, passing legislation to reauthorize the Center eight times since its creation in 1976.
<br>
<br>"(E) The American Folklife Center is the only unit in the Library of Congress which is not permanently authorized. Since its establishment in 1976, the Center's collections and activities have been fully and successfully integrated into the Library of Congress. It is useful to statutorily conform the American Folklife Center with the rest of the Library of Congress.
<br>
<br>"(2) Purpose.—It is the purpose of this section [amending sections 2103, 2106, and 2107 of this title and enacting provisions set out as a note under section 2103 of this title] to authorize permanently the American Folklife Center in the Library of Congress to preserve and present American Folklife."

<br>SUBCHAPTER II—VETERANS' ORAL HISTORY
<br>§2141. Findings; purpose
<br>(a) Findings
<br>
<br>Congress finds as follows:
<br>
<br>(1) Military service during a time of war is the highest sacrifice a citizen may make for his or her country.
<br>
<br>(2) 4,700,000 Americans served in World War I, 16,500,000 Americans served in World War II, 6,800,000 Americans served in the Korean Conflict, 9,200,000 Americans served in the Vietnam Conflict, 3,800,000 Americans served in the Persian Gulf War, and countless other Americans served in military engagements overseas throughout the 20th century.
<br>
<br>(3) The Department of Veterans Affairs reports that there are almost 19,000,000 war veterans living in this Nation today.
<br>
<br>(4) Today there are only approximately 3,400 living veterans of World War I, and of the some 6,000,000 veterans of World War II alive today, almost 1,500 die each day.
<br>
<br>(5) Oral histories are of immeasurable value to historians, researchers, authors, journalists, film makers, scholars, students, and citizens of all walks of life.
<br>
<br>(6) War veterans possess an invaluable resource in their memories of the conflicts in which they served, and can provide a rich history of our Nation and its people through the retelling of those memories, yet frequently those who served during times of conflict are reticent to family and friends about their experiences.
<br>
<br>(7) It is in the Nation's best interest to collect and catalog oral histories of American war veterans so that future generations will have original sources of information regarding the lives and times of those who served in war and the conditions under which they endured, so that Americans will always remember those who served in war and may learn first-hand of the heroics, tediousness, horrors, and triumphs of war.
<br>
<br>(8) The Library of Congress, as the Nation's oldest Federal cultural institution and largest and most inclusive library in human history (with nearly 119,000,000 items in its multimedia collection) 1 is an appropriate repository to collect, preserve, and make available to the public an archive of these oral histories. The Library's American Folklife Center has expertise in the management of documentation projects and experience in the development of cultural and educational programs for the public.
<br>(b) Purpose
<br>
<br>It is the purpose of this subchapter to create a new federally sponsored, authorized, and funded program that will coordinate at a national level the collection of video and audio recordings of personal histories and testimonials of American war veterans, and to assist and encourage local efforts to preserve the memories of this Nation's war veterans so that Americans of all current and future generations may hear directly from veterans and better appreciate the realities of war and the sacrifices made by those who served in uniform during wartime.

<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>The Director of the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress shall establish an oral history program—

<br>(A) personal histories and testimonials of veterans of the Armed Forces who served during a period of war; and
<br>
<br>(B) biographical histories by immediate family members of members of the Armed Forces who became missing in action or died as a result of their service during a period of war;
<br>
<br>(2) to create a collection of the recordings obtained (including a catalog and index) which will be available for public use through the National Digital Library of the Library of Congress and such other methods as the Director considers appropriate to the extent feasible subject to available resources; and
<br>
<br>(3) to solicit, reproduce, and collect written materials (such as letters and diaries) relevant to the personal histories of veterans of the Armed Forces who served during a period of war and to catalog such materials in a manner the Director considers appropriate, consistent with and complimentary 1 to the efforts described in paragraphs (1) and (2).
<br>(b) Use of and consultation with other entities
<br>
<br>The Director may carry out the activities described in paragraphs (1) and (3) of subsection (a) through agreements and partnerships entered into with other government and private entities, and may otherwise consult with interested persons (within the limits of available resources) and develop appropriate guidelines and arrangements for soliciting, acquiring, and making available recordings under the program under this subchapter.
<br>(c) Timing
<br>
<br>As soon as practicable after October 27, 2000, the Director shall begin collecting video and audio recordings under subsection (a)(1), and shall attempt to collect the first such recordings from the oldest veterans.

<br>
<br>(3) increasing State and local flexibility in providing services and activities designed to develop, implement, and improve career and technical education;
<br>
<br>(4) conducting and disseminating national research and disseminating information on best practices that improve career and technical education programs and programs of study, services, and activities;
