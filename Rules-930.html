<br>
<br>At the earliest practicable date after August 23, 1988, the President shall—
<br>
<br>(1) proclaim such modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule as are consistent with the standards applied in converting the old Schedules into the format of the Convention, as reflected in such Publication No. 2030 and Supplement No. 1.1 thereto, and as are necessary or appropriate to implement—

<br>

<br>(b) Generalized System of Preferences conversion
<br>
<br>(1) The review of the proposed conversion of the Generalized System of Preferences program to the Convention tariff nomenclature, initiated by the Office of the United States Trade Representative by notice published in the Federal Register on December 8, 1986 (at page 44,163 of volume 51 thereof), shall be treated as satisfying the requirements of sections 2463(a) and 2464(c)(3) of this title (as in effect on July 31, 1995).

<br>
<br>(A) an article that was previously subject to the restriction being excluded from the restriction; or
<br>
<br>(B) an article not previously subject to the restriction being included within the restriction;
<br>
<br>the President may proclaim changes in subchapter IV of chapter 99 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule to conform that subchapter to the fullest extent possible to part 3 of the Appendix to the old Schedules.
<br>
<br>(2) Whenever the President determines that the conversion from headnote 2 of subpart A of part 10 of schedule 1 of the old Schedules to Additional U.S. Note 2, chapter 17, of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule results in—
<br>
<br>(A) an article that was previously covered by such headnote being excluded from coverage; or
<br>
<br>(B) an article not previously covered by such headnote being included in coverage;
<br>
<br>the President may proclaim changes in Additional U.S. Note 2, chapter 17 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule to conform that note to the fullest extent possible to headnote 2 of subpart A of part 10 of schedule 1 of the old Schedules.
<br>
<br>(3) No change to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule may be proclaimed under paragraph (1) or (2) after June 30, 1990.
<br>(d) Certain protests and petitions under customs law
<br>
<br>(1)(A) This chapter may not be considered to divest the courts of jurisdiction over—
<br>
<br>(i) any protest filed under section 1514 of this title; or
<br>
<br>(ii) any petition by an American manufacturer, producer, or wholesaler under section 1516 of this title;
<br>
<br>covering articles entered before January 1, 1989.
<br>
<br>(B) Nothing in this chapter shall affect the jurisdiction of the courts with respect to articles entered after January 1, 1989.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) If any protest or petition referred to in paragraph (1)(A) is sustained in whole or in part by a final judicial decision, the entries subject to that protest or petition and made before January 1, 1989, shall be liquidated or reliquidated, as appropriate, in accordance with such final judicial decision under the old Schedules.
<br>
<br>(B) At the earliest practicable date after January 1, 1989, the Commission shall initiate an investigation under section 1332 of this title of those final judicial decisions referred to in subparagraph (A) that—
<br>
<br>(i) are published during the 2-year period beginning on February 1, 1988; and
<br>
<br>(ii) would have affected tariff treatment if they had been published during the period of the conversion of the old Schedules into the format of the Convention.
<br>
<br>No later than September 1, 1990, the Commission shall report the results of the investigation to the President, the Committee on Ways and Means, and the Committee on Finance, and shall recommend those changes to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule that the Commission would have recommended if the final decisions concerned had been made before the conversion into the format of the Convention occurred.
<br>
<br>(3) The President shall review all changes recommended by the Commission under paragraph (2)(B) and shall, as soon as practicable, proclaim such of those changes, if any, which he decides are necessary or appropriate to conform such Schedule to the final judicial decisions. Any such change shall be effective with respect to—
<br>
<br>(A) entries made on or after the date of such proclamation; and
<br>
<br>(B) entries made on or after January 1, 1989, if, notwithstanding section 1514 of this title, application for liquidation or reliquidation thereof is made by the importer to the customs officer concerned within 180 days after the effective date of such proclamation.
<br>
<br>(4) If any protest or petition referred to in paragraph (1)(A) is not sustained in whole or in part by a final judicial decision, the entries subject to that petition or protest and made before January 1, 1989, shall be liquidated or reliquidated, as appropriate, in accordance with the final judicial decision under the old Schedules.

<br>§3101. Findings and purposes
<br>(a) Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) rapid growth in the world market for telecommunications products and services is likely to continue for several decades;
<br>
<br>(2) the United States can improve prospects for—
<br>
<br>(A) the growth of—
<br>
<br>(i) United States exports of telecommunications products and services, and
<br>
<br>(ii) export-related employment and consumer services in the United States, and
<br>
<br>(B) the continuance of the technological leadership of the United States,
<br>
<br>by undertaking a program to achieve an open world market for trade in telecommunications products, services, and investment;
<br>
<br>(3) most foreign markets for telecommunications products, services, and investment are characterized by extensive government intervention (including restrictive import practices and discriminatory procurement practices) which adversely affect United States exports of telecommunications products and services and United States investment in telecommunications;
<br>
<br>(4) the open nature of the United States telecommunications market, accruing from the liberalization and restructuring of such market, has contributed, and will continue to contribute, to an increase in imports of telecommunications products and a growing imbalance in competitive opportunities for trade in telecommunications;
<br>
<br>(5) unless this imbalance is corrected through the achievement of mutually advantageous market opportunities for trade in telecommunications products and services between the United States and foreign countries, the United States should avoid granting continued open access to the telecommunications products and services of such foreign countries in the United States market; and
<br>
<br>(6) the unique business conditions in the worldwide market for telecommunications products and services caused by the combination of deregulation and divestiture in the United States, which represents a unilateral liberalization of United States trade with the rest of the world, and continuing government intervention in the domestic industries of many other countries create a need to make an exception in the case of telecommunications products and services that should not necessarily be a precedent for legislating specific sectoral priorities in combating the closed markets or unfair foreign trade practices of other countries.
<br>(b) Purposes
<br>
<br>The purposes of this chapter are—
<br>
<br>(1) to foster the economic and technological growth of, and employment in, the United States telecommunications industry;
<br>
<br>(2) to secure a high quality telecommunications network for the benefit of the people of the United States;
<br>
<br>(3) to develop an international consensus in favor of open trade and competition in telecommunications products and services;
<br>
<br>(4) to ensure that countries which have made commitments to open telecommunications trade fully abide by those commitments; and
<br>
<br>(5) to achieve a more open world trading system for telecommunications products and services through negotiation and provision of mutually advantageous market opportunities for United States telecommunications exporters and their subsidiaries in those markets in which barriers exist to free international trade.

<br>§3103. Investigation of foreign telecommunications trade barriers
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>The Trade Representative shall conduct an investigation to identify priority foreign countries. Such investigation shall be concluded by no later than the date that is 5 months after August 23, 1988.
<br>(b) Factors to be taken into account
<br>
<br>In identifying priority foreign countries under subsection (a), the Trade Representative shall take into account, among other relevant factors—
<br>
<br>(1) the nature and significance of the acts, policies, and practices that deny mutually advantageous market opportunities to telecommunications products and services of United States firms;
<br>
<br>(2) the economic benefits (actual and potential) accruing to foreign firms from open access to the United States market;
<br>
<br>(3) the potential size of the market of a foreign country for telecommunications products and services of United States firms;
<br>
<br>(4) the potential to increase United States exports of telecommunications products and services, either directly or through the establishment of a beneficial precedent; and
<br>
<br>(5) measurable progress being made to eliminate the objectionable acts, policies, or practices.
<br>(c) Revocations and additional identifications
<br>
<br>(1) The Trade Representative may at any time, after taking into account the factors described in subsection (b)—
<br>
<br>(A) revoke the identification of any priority foreign country that was made under this section, or
<br>
<br>(B) identify any foreign country as a priority foreign country under this section,
<br>
<br>if information available to the Trade Representative indicates that such action is appropriate.
<br>
<br>(2) The Trade Representative shall include in the semiannual report submitted to the Congress under section 2419(3) of this title a detailed explanation of the reasons for the revocation under paragraph (1) of this subsection of any identification of any foreign country as a priority foreign country.
<br>(d) Report to Congress
<br>
<br>By no later than the date that is 30 days after the date on which the investigation conducted under subsection (a) is completed, the United States Trade Representative shall submit a report on the investigation to the President and to appropriate committees of the Congress.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 100–418, title I, §1374, Aug. 23, 1988, 102 Stat. 1217.)

<br>(1) the date that is 30 days after the date on which any foreign country is identified in the investigation conducted under section 3103(a) of this title as a priority foreign country, and
<br>
<br>(2) the date on which any foreign country is identified under section 3103(c)(1)(B) of this title as a priority foreign country,
<br>
<br>the President shall enter into negotiations with such priority foreign country for the purpose of entering into a bilateral or multilateral trade agreement under chapter 17 of this title which meets the specific negotiating objectives established by the President under subsection (b) for such priority foreign country.
<br>(b) Establishment of specific negotiating objectives for each foreign priority country
<br>
<br>(1) The President shall establish such relevant specific negotiating objectives on a country-by-country basis as are necessary to meet the general negotiating objectives of the United States under this section.
<br>

<br>
<br>(i) changed practices by the priority foreign country,
<br>
<br>(ii) tangible substantive developments in multilateral negotiations,
<br>
<br>(iii) changes in competitive positions, technological developments, or
<br>
<br>(iv) other relevant factors.
<br>
<br>(B) By no later than the date that is 30 days after the date on which the President makes any modifications or refinements to specific negotiating objectives under subparagraph (A), the President shall submit to appropriate committees of the Congress a statement describing such modifications or refinements and the reasons for such modifications or refinements.
<br>(c) General negotiating objectives
<br>
<br>The general negotiating objectives of the United States under this section are—
<br>
<br>(1) to obtain multilateral or bilateral agreements (or the modification of existing agreements) that provide mutually advantageous market opportunities for trade in telecommunications products and services between the United States and foreign countries;

<br>(B) the marketing of the products in a foreign country,
<br>
<br>be limited to the certification by the manufacturer that the products meet the standards established by the foreign country for preventing harm to the network or network personnel;
<br>
<br>(8) transparency of, and open participation in, the standards-setting processes used in foreign countries with respect to telecommunications products;

<br>§3106. Review of trade agreement implementation by Trade Representative
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>(1) In conducting the annual analysis under section 181(a) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2241), the Trade Representative shall review the operation and effectiveness of—
<br>
<br>(A) each trade agreement negotiated by reason of this chapter that is in force with respect to the United States; and
<br>
<br>(B) every other trade agreement regarding telecommunications products or services that is in force with respect to the United States.
<br>
<br>(2) In each review conducted under paragraph (1), the Trade Representative shall determine whether any act, policy, or practice of the foreign country that has entered into the agreement described in paragraph (1)—
<br>
<br>(A) is not in compliance with the terms of such agreement, or
<br>
<br>(B) otherwise denies, within the context of the terms of such agreement, to telecommunications products and services of United States firms mutually advantageous market opportunities in that foreign country.
<br>(b) Review factors
<br>
<br>(1) In conducting reviews under subsection (a), the Trade Representative shall consider any evidence of actual patterns of trade (including United States exports to a foreign country of telecommunications products and services, including sales and services related to those products) that do not reflect patterns of trade which would reasonably be anticipated to flow from the concessions or commitments of such country based on the international competitive position and export potential of such products and services.
<br>
<br>(2) The Trade Representative shall consult with the United States International Trade Commission with regard to the actual patterns of trade described in paragraph (1).
<br>(c) Action in response to affirmative determination
<br>
<br>(1) Any affirmative determination made by the Trade Representative under subsection (a)(2) with respect to any act, policy, or practice of a foreign country shall, for purposes of chapter 1 of title III of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2411 et seq.], be treated as an affirmative determination under section 304(a)(1)(A) of such Act [19 U.S.C. 2414(a)(1)(A)] that such act, policy, or practice violates a trade agreement.
<br>
<br>(2) In taking actions under section 301 [19 U.S.C. 2411] by reason of paragraph (1), the Trade Representative shall first take those actions which most directly affect trade in telecommunications products and services with the priority foreign country referred to in paragraph (1), unless the Trade Representative determines that actions against other economic sectors would be more effective in achieving compliance by the foreign country with the trade agreement that is the subject of the affirmative determination made under subsection (a)(2).

<br>
<br>If—
<br>
<br>(1) the President has taken action under section 3105(a) of this title with respect to any foreign country, and
<br>
<br>(2) such action is found to be inconsistent with the international obligations of the United States, including the WTO Agreement and the multilateral trade agreements (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (9) and (4), respectively, of section 3501 of this title),
<br>
<br>the President may enter into trade agreements with such foreign country for the purpose of granting new concessions as compensation for such action in order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions.
