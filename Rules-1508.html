<br>
<br>(B) the employer's proportional share, if any, of the unamortized amount of the plan's unfunded vested benefits at the end of the plan year ending before September 26, 1980, as determined under paragraph (3); and
<br>
<br>(C) the employer's proportional share of the unamortized amounts of the reallocated unfunded vested benefits (if any) as determined under paragraph (4).
<br>
<br>If the sum of the amounts determined with respect to an employer under paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) is negative, the unfunded vested benefits allocable to the employer shall be zero.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) An employer's proportional share of the unamortized amount of the change in the plan's unfunded vested benefits for plan years ending after September 25, 1980, is the sum of the employer's proportional shares of the unamortized amount of the change in unfunded vested benefits for each plan year in which the employer has an obligation to contribute under the plan ending—
<br>
<br>(i) after such date, and
<br>
<br>(ii) before the plan year in which the withdrawal of the employer occurs.
<br>
<br>(B) The change in a plan's unfunded vested benefits for a plan year is the amount by which—
<br>
<br>(i) the unfunded vested benefits at the end of the plan year; exceeds
<br>
<br>(ii) the sum of—
<br>
<br>(I) the unamortized amount of the unfunded vested benefits for the last plan year ending before September 26, 1980, and
<br>
<br>(II) the sum of the unamortized amounts of the change in unfunded vested benefits for each plan year ending after September 25, 1980, and preceding the plan year for which the change is determined.
<br>
<br>(C) The unamortized amount of the change in a plan's unfunded vested benefits with respect to a plan year is the change in unfunded vested benefits for the plan year, reduced by 5 percent of such change for each succeeding plan year.
<br>
<br>(D) The unamortized amount of the unfunded vested benefits for the last plan year ending before September 26, 1980, is the amount of the unfunded vested benefits as of the end of that plan year reduced by 5 percent of such amount for each succeeding plan year.
<br>
<br>(E) An employer's proportional share of the unamortized amount of a change in unfunded vested benefits is the product of—
<br>
<br>(i) the unamortized amount of such change (as of the end of the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws); multiplied by
<br>
<br>(ii) a fraction—
<br>
<br>(I) the numerator of which is the sum of the contributions required to be made under the plan by the employer for the year in which such change arose and for the 4 preceding plan years, and
<br>
<br>(II) the denominator of which is the sum for the plan year in which such change arose and the 4 preceding plan years of all contributions made by employers who had an obligation to contribute under the plan for the plan year in which such change arose reduced by the contributions made in such years by employers who had withdrawn from the plan in the year in which the change arose.
<br>
<br>(3) An employer's proportional share of the unamortized amount of the plan's unfunded vested benefits for the last plan year ending before September 26, 1980, is the product of—
<br>
<br>(A) such unamortized amount; multiplied by—
<br>
<br>(B) a fraction—
<br>
<br>(i) the numerator of which is the sum of all contributions required to be made by the employer under the plan for the most recent 5 plan years ending before September 26, 1980, and
<br>
<br>(ii) the denominator of which is the sum of all contributions made for the most recent 5 plan years ending before September 26, 1980, by all employers—
<br>
<br>(I) who had an obligation to contribute under the plan for the first plan year ending on or after such date, and
<br>
<br>(II) who had not withdrawn from the plan before such date.
<br>
<br>(4)(A) An employer's proportional share of the unamortized amount of the reallocated unfunded vested benefits is the sum of the employer's proportional share of the unamortized amount of the reallocated unfunded vested benefits for each plan year ending before the plan year in which the employer withdrew from the plan.
<br>
<br>(B) Except as otherwise provided in regulations prescribed by the corporation, the reallocated unfunded vested benefits for a plan year is the sum of—
<br>
<br>(i) any amount which the plan sponsor determines in that plan year to be uncollectible for reasons arising out of cases or proceedings under title 11, or similar proceedings.1
<br>
<br>(ii) any amount which the plan sponsor determines in that plan year will not be assessed as a result of the operation of section 1389, 1399(c)(1)(B), or 1405 of this title against an employer to whom a notice described in section 1399 of this title has been sent, and
<br>
<br>(iii) any amount which the plan sponsor determines to be uncollectible or unassessable in that plan year for other reasons under standards not inconsistent with regulations prescribed by the corporation.
<br>
<br>(C) The unamortized amount of the reallocated unfunded vested benefits with respect to a plan year is the reallocated unfunded vested benefits for the plan year, reduced by 5 percent of such reallocated unfunded vested benefits for each succeeding plan year.
<br>
<br>(D) An employer's proportional share of the unamortized amount of the reallocated unfunded vested benefits with respect to a plan year is the product of—
<br>
<br>(i) the unamortized amount of the reallocated unfunded vested benefits (as of the end of the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws); multiplied by
<br>
<br>(ii) the fraction defined in paragraph (2)(E)(ii).
<br>(c) Amendment of multiemployer plan for determination respecting amount of unfunded vested benefits allocable to employer withdrawn from plan; factors determining computation of amount
<br>
<br>(1) A multiemployer plan, other than a plan which primarily covers employees in the building and construction industry, may be amended to provide that the amount of unfunded vested benefits allocable to an employer that withdraws from the plan is an amount determined under paragraph (2), (3), (4), or (5) of this subsection, rather than under subsection (b) or (d). A plan described in section 1383(b)(1)(B)(i) of this title (relating to the building and construction industry) may be amended, to the extent provided in regulations prescribed by the corporation, to provide that the amount of the unfunded vested benefits allocable to an employer not described in section 1383(b)(1)(A) of this title shall be determined in a manner different from that provided in subsection (b).
<br>
<br>(2)(A) The amount of the unfunded vested benefits allocable to any employer under this paragraph is the sum of the amounts determined under subparagraphs (B) and (C).
<br>
<br>(B) The amount determined under this subparagraph is the product of—
<br>
<br>(i) the plan's unfunded vested benefits as of the end of the last plan year ending before September 26, 1980, reduced as if those obligations were being fully amortized in level annual installments over 15 years beginning with the first plan year ending on or after such date; multiplied by
<br>
<br>(ii) a fraction—
<br>
<br>(I) the numerator of which is the sum of all contributions required to be made by the employer under the plan for the last 5 plan years ending before September 26, 1980, and
<br>
<br>(II) the denominator of which is the sum of all contributions made for the last 5 plan years ending before September 26, 1980, by all employers who had an obligation to contribute under the plan for the first plan year ending after September 25, 1980, and who had not withdrawn from the plan before such date.
<br>
<br>(C) The amount determined under this subparagraph is the product of—
<br>
<br>(i) an amount equal to—
<br>
<br>(I) the plan's unfunded vested benefits as of the end of the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws, less
<br>
<br>(II) the sum of the value as of such date of all outstanding claims for withdrawal liability which can reasonably be expected to be collected, with respect to employers withdrawing before such plan year, and that portion of the amount determined under subparagraph (B)(i) which is allocable to employers who have an obligation to contribute under the plan in the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws and who also had an obligation to contribute under the plan for the first plan year ending after September 25, 1980; multiplied by
<br>
<br>(ii) a fraction—
<br>
<br>(I) the numerator of which is the total amount required to be contributed under the plan by the employer for the last 5 plan years ending before the date on which the employer withdraws, and
<br>
<br>(II) the denominator of which is the total amount contributed under the plan by all employers for the last 5 plan years ending before the date on which the employer withdraws, increased by the amount of any employer contributions owed with respect to earlier periods which were collected in those plan years, and decreased by any amount contributed by an employer who withdrew from the plan under this part during those plan years.
<br>
<br>(D) The corporation may by regulation permit adjustments in any denominator under this section, consistent with the purposes of this subchapter, where such adjustment would be appropriate to ease administrative burdens of plan sponsors in calculating such denominators.
<br>
<br>(3) The amount of the unfunded vested benefits allocable to an employer under this paragraph is the product of—
<br>
<br>(A) the plan's unfunded vested benefits as of the end of the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws, less the value as of the end of such year of all outstanding claims for withdrawal liability which can reasonably be expected to be collected from employers withdrawing before such year; multiplied by
<br>
<br>(B) a fraction—
<br>
<br>(i) the numerator of which is the total amount required to be contributed by the employer under the plan for the last 5 plan years ending before the withdrawal, and
<br>
<br>(ii) the denominator of which is the total amount contributed under the plan by all employers for the last 5 plan years ending before the withdrawal, increased by any employer contributions owed with respect to earlier periods which were collected in those plan years, and decreased by any amount contributed to the plan during those plan years by employers who withdrew from the plan under this section during those plan years.
<br>
<br>(4)(A) The amount of the unfunded vested benefits allocable to an employer under this paragraph is equal to the sum of—
<br>
<br>(i) the plan's unfunded vested benefits which are attributable to participants' service with the employer (determined as of the end of the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws), and
<br>
<br>(ii) the employer's proportional share of any unfunded vested benefits which are not attributable to service with the employer or other employers who are obligated to contribute under the plan in the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws (determined as of the end of the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws).
<br>
<br>(B) The plan's unfunded vested benefits which are attributable to participants' service with the employer is the amount equal to the value of nonforfeitable benefits under the plan which are attributable to participants' service with such employer (determined under plan rules not inconsistent with regulations of the corporation) decreased by the share of plan assets determined under subparagraph (C) which is allocated to the employer as provided under subparagraph (D).
<br>
<br>(C) The value of plan assets determined under this subparagraph is the value of plan assets allocated to nonforfeitable benefits which are attributable to service with the employers who have an obligation to contribute under the plan in the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws, which is determined by multiplying—
<br>
<br>(i) the value of the plan assets as of the end of the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws, by
<br>
<br>(ii) a fraction—
<br>
<br>(I) the numerator of which is the value of nonforfeitable benefits which are attributable to service with such employers, and
<br>
<br>(II) the denominator of which is the value of all nonforfeitable benefits under the plan
<br>
<br>as of the end of the plan year.
<br>
<br>(D) The share of plan assets, determined under subparagraph (C), which is allocated to the employer shall be determined in accordance with one of the following methods which shall be adopted by the plan by amendment:
<br>
<br>(i) by multiplying the value of plan assets determined under subparagraph (C) by a fraction—
<br>
<br>(I) the numerator of which is the value of the nonforfeitable benefits which are attributable to service with the employer, and
<br>
<br>(II) the denominator of which is the value of the nonforfeitable benefits which are attributable to service with all employers who have an obligation to contribute under the plan in the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws;
<br>
<br>(ii) by multiplying the value of plan assets determined under subparagraph (C) by a fraction—
<br>
<br>(I) the numerator of which is the sum of all contributions (accumulated with interest) which have been made to the plan by the employer for the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws and all preceding plan years; and
<br>
<br>(II) the denominator of which is the sum of all contributions (accumulated with interest) which have been made to the plan (for the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws and all preceding plan years) by all employers who have an obligation to contribute to the plan for the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws; or
<br>
<br>(iii) by multiplying the value of plan assets under subparagraph (C) by a fraction—
<br>
<br>(I) the numerator of which is the amount determined under clause (ii)(I) of this subparagraph, less the sum of benefit payments (accumulated with interest) made to participants (and their beneficiaries) for the plan years described in such clause (ii)(I) which are attributable to service with the employer; and
<br>
<br>(II) the denominator of which is the amount determined under clause (ii)(II) of this subparagraph, reduced by the sum of benefit payments (accumulated with interest) made to participants (and their beneficiaries) for the plan years described in such clause (ii)(II) which are attributable to service with respect to the employers described in such clause (ii)(II).
<br>
<br>(E) The amount of the plan's unfunded vested benefits for a plan year preceding the plan year in which an employer withdraws, which is not attributable to service with employers who have an obligation to contribute under the plan in the plan year preceding the plan year in which such employer withdraws, is equal to—
<br>
<br>(i) an amount equal to—
<br>
<br>(I) the value of all nonforfeitable benefits under the plan at the end of such plan year, reduced by
<br>
<br>(II) the value of nonforfeitable benefits under the plan at the end of such plan year which are attributable to participants' service with employers who have an obligation to contribute under the plan for such plan year; reduced by
<br>
<br>(ii) an amount equal to—
<br>
<br>(I) the value of the plan assets as of the end of such plan year, reduced by
<br>
<br>(II) the value of plan assets as of the end of such plan year as determined under subparagraph (C); reduced by
<br>
<br>(iii) the value of all outstanding claims for withdrawal liability which can reasonably be expected to be collected with respect to employers withdrawing before the year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws.
<br>
<br>(F) The employer's proportional share described in subparagraph (A)(ii) for a plan year is the amount determined under subparagraph (E) for the employer, but not in excess of an amount which bears the same ratio to the sum of the amounts determined under subparagraph (E) for all employers under the plan as the amount determined under subparagraph (C) for the employer bears to the sum of the amounts determined under subparagraph (C) for all employers under the plan.
<br>
<br>(G) The corporation may prescribe by regulation other methods which a plan may adopt for allocating assets to determine the amount of the unfunded vested benefits attributable to service with the employer and to determine the employer's share of unfunded vested benefits not attributable to service with employers who have an obligation to contribute under the plan in the plan year in which the employer withdraws.
<br>
<br>(5)(A) The corporation shall prescribe by regulation a procedure by which a plan may, by amendment, adopt any other alternative method for determining an employer's allocable share of unfunded vested benefits under this section, subject to the approval of the corporation based on its determination that adoption of the method by the plan would not significantly increase the risk of loss to plan participants and beneficiaries or to the corporation.
<br>
<br>(B) The corporation may prescribe by regulation standard approaches for alternative methods, other than those set forth in the preceding paragraphs of this subsection, which a plan may adopt under subparagraph (A), for which the corporation may waive or modify the approval requirements of subparagraph (A). Any alternative method shall provide for the allocation of substantially all of a plan's unfunded vested benefits among employers who have an obligation to contribute under the plan.
<br>
<br>(C) Unless the corporation by regulation provides otherwise, a plan may be amended to provide that a period of more than 5 but not more than 10 plan years may be used for determining the numerator and denominator of any fraction which is used under any method authorized under this section for determining an employer's allocable share of unfunded vested benefits under this section.
<br>
<br>(D) The corporation may by regulation permit adjustments in any denominator under this section, consistent with the purposes of this subchapter, where such adjustment would be appropriate to ease administrative burdens of plan sponsors in calculating such denominators.
<br>
<br>(E) Fresh start option.—Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a plan may be amended to provide that the withdrawal liability method described in subsection (b) shall be applied by substituting the plan year which is specified in the amendment and for which the plan has no unfunded vested benefits for the plan year ending before September 26, 1980.
<br>(d) Method of calculating allocable share of employer of unfunded vested benefits set forth in subsection (c)(3); applicability of certain statutory provisions
<br>
<br>(1) The method of calculating an employer's allocable share of unfunded vested benefits set forth in subsection (c)(3) shall be the method for calculating an employer's allocable share of unfunded vested benefits under a plan to which section 404(c) of title 26, or a continuation of such a plan, applies, unless the plan is amended to adopt another method authorized under subsection (b) or (c).
<br>
<br>(2) Sections 1384, 1389, 1399(c)(1)(B), and 1405 of this title shall not apply with respect to the withdrawal of an employer from a plan described in paragraph (1) unless the plan is amended to provide that any of such sections apply.
<br>(e) Reduction of liability of withdrawn employer in case of transfer of liabilities to another plan incident to withdrawal or partial withdrawal of employer
<br>
<br>In the case of a transfer of liabilities to another plan incident to an employer's withdrawal or partial withdrawal, the withdrawn employer's liability under this part shall be reduced in an amount equal to the value, as of the end of the last plan year ending on or before the date of the withdrawal, of the transferred unfunded vested benefits.
<br>(f) Computations applicable in case of withdrawal following merger of multiemployer plans
<br>
<br>In the case of a withdrawal following a merger of multiemployer plans, subsection (b), (c), or (d) shall be applied in accordance with regulations prescribed by the corporation; except that, if a withdrawal occurs in the first plan year beginning after a merger of multiemployer plans, the determination under this section shall be made as if each of the multiemployer plans had remained separate plans.

<br>§1392. Obligation to contribute
<br>(a) "Obligation to contribute" defined
<br>
<br>For purposes of this part, the term "obligation to contribute" means an obligation to contribute arising—
<br>
<br>(1) under one or more collective bargaining (or related) agreements, or
<br>
<br>(2) as a result of a duty under applicable labor-management relations law, but
<br>
<br>does not include an obligation to pay withdrawal liability under this section or to pay delinquent contributions.
<br>(b) Payments of withdrawal liability not considered contributions
<br>
<br>Payments of withdrawal liability under this part shall not be considered contributions for purposes of this part.
<br>(c) Transactions to evade or avoid liability
<br>
<br>If a principal purpose of any transaction is to evade or avoid liability under this part, this part shall be applied (and liability shall be determined and collected) without regard to such transaction.

<br>§1393. Actuarial assumptions
<br>(a) Use by plan actuary in determining unfunded vested benefits of a plan for computing withdrawal liability of employer
<br>
<br>The corporation may prescribe by regulation actuarial assumptions which may be used by a plan actuary in determining the unfunded vested benefits of a plan for purposes of determining an employer's withdrawal liability under this part. Withdrawal liability under this part shall be determined by each plan on the basis of—
<br>
<br>(1) actuarial assumptions and methods which, in the aggregate, are reasonable (taking into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations) and which, in combination, offer the actuary's best estimate of anticipated experience under the plan, or
<br>
<br>(2) actuarial assumptions and methods set forth in the corporation's regulations for purposes of determining an employer's withdrawal liability.
<br>(b) Factors determinative of unfunded vested benefits of plan for computing withdrawal liability of employer
<br>
<br>In determining the unfunded vested benefits of a plan for purposes of determining an employer's withdrawal liability under this part, the plan actuary may—
<br>
<br>(1) rely on the most recent complete actuarial valuation used for purposes of section 412 of title 26 and reasonable estimates for the interim years of the unfunded vested benefits, and
<br>
<br>(2) in the absence of complete data, rely on the data available or on data secured by a sampling which can reasonably be expected to be representative of the status of the entire plan.
<br>(c) Determination of amount of unfunded vested benefits
<br>
<br>For purposes of this part, the term "unfunded vested benefits" means with respect to a plan, an amount equal to—
<br>
<br>(A) the value of nonforfeitable benefits under the plan, less
<br>
<br>(B) the value of the assets of the plan.

<br>§1396. Special rules for plans under section 404(c) of title 26
<br>(a) Amount of withdrawal liability; determinative factors
<br>
<br>In the case of a plan described in subsection (b)—
<br>
<br>(1) if an employer withdraws prior to a termination described in section 1341a(a)(2) of this title, the amount of withdrawal liability to be paid in any year by such employer shall be an amount equal to the greater of—
<br>
<br>(A) the amount determined under section 1399(c)(1)(C)(i) of this title, or
<br>
<br>(B) the product of—
<br>
<br>(i) the number of contribution base units for which the employer would have been required to make contributions for the prior plan year if the employer had not withdrawn, multiplied by
<br>
<br>(ii) the contribution rate for the plan year which would be required to meet the amortization schedules contained in section 1423(d)(3)(B)(ii) 1 of this title (determined without regard to any limitation on such rate otherwise provided by this subchapter)
<br>
<br>except that an employer shall not be required to pay an amount in excess of the withdrawal liability computed with interest; and
<br>
<br>(2) the withdrawal liability of an employer who withdraws after December 31, 1983, as a result of a termination described in section 1341a(a)(2) of this title which is agreed to by the labor organization that appoints the employee representative on the joint board of trustees which sponsors the plan, shall be determined under subsection (c) if—
<br>
<br>(A) as a result of prior employer withdrawals in any plan year commencing after January 1, 1980, the number of contribution base units is reduced to less than 67 percent of the average number of such units for the calendar years 1974 through 1979; and
<br>

<br>§1399. Notice, collection, etc., of withdrawal liability
<br>(a) Furnishing of information by employer to plan sponsor
<br>
<br>An employer shall, within 30 days after a written request from the plan sponsor, furnish such information as the plan sponsor reasonably determines to be necessary to enable the plan sponsor to comply with the requirements of this part.
<br>(b) Notification, demand for payment, and review upon complete or partial withdrawal by employer
<br>
<br>(1) As soon as practicable after an employer's complete or partial withdrawal, the plan sponsor shall—
<br>
<br>(A) notify the employer of—
<br>
<br>(i) the amount of the liability, and
<br>
<br>(ii) the schedule for liability payments, and
<br>
<br>(B) demand payment in accordance with the schedule.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) No later than 90 days after the employer receives the notice described in paragraph (1), the employer—
<br>
<br>(i) may ask the plan sponsor to review any specific matter relating to the determination of the employer's liability and the schedule of payments,
<br>
<br>(ii) may identify any inaccuracy in the determination of the amount of the unfunded vested benefits allocable to the employer, and
<br>
<br>(iii) may furnish any additional relevant information to the plan sponsor.
<br>
<br>(B) After a reasonable review of any matter raised, the plan sponsor shall notify the employer of—
<br>
<br>(i) the plan sponsor's decision,
<br>
<br>(ii) the basis for the decision, and
<br>
<br>(iii) the reason for any change in the determination of the employer's liability or schedule of liability payments.
<br>(c) Payment requirements; amount, etc.
<br>
<br>(1)(A)(i) Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (D) of this paragraph and in paragraphs (4) and (5), an employer shall pay the amount determined under section 1391 of this title, adjusted if appropriate first under section 1389 of this title and then under section 1386 of this title over the period of years necessary to amortize the amount in level annual payments determined under subparagraph (C), calculated as if the first payment were made on the first day of the plan year following the plan year in which the withdrawal occurs and as if each subsequent payment were made on the first day of each subsequent plan year. Actual payment shall commence in accordance with paragraph (2).
<br>
<br>(ii) The determination of the amortization period described in clause (i) shall be based on the assumptions used for the most recent actuarial valuation for the plan.
<br>
<br>(B) In any case in which the amortization period described in subparagraph (A) exceeds 20 years, the employer's liability shall be limited to the first 20 annual payments determined under subparagraph (C).
<br>
<br>(C)(i) Except as provided in subparagraph (E), the amount of each annual payment shall be the product of—
<br>
<br>(I) the average annual number of contribution base units for the period of 3 consecutive plan years, during the period of 10 consecutive plan years ending before the plan year in which the withdrawal occurs, in which the number of contribution base units for which the employer had an obligation to contribute under the plan is the highest, and
<br>
<br>(II) the highest contribution rate at which the employer had an obligation to contribute under the plan during the 10 plan years ending with the plan year in which the withdrawal occurs.
<br>
<br>For purposes of the preceding sentence, a partial withdrawal described in section 1385(a)(1) of this title shall be deemed to occur on the last day of the first year of the 3-year testing period described in section 1385(b)(1)(B)(i) of this title.
<br>
<br>(ii)(I) A plan may be amended to provide that for any plan year ending before 1986 the amount of each annual payment shall be (in lieu of the amount determined under clause (i)) the average of the required employer contributions under the plan for the period of 3 consecutive plan years (during the period of 10 consecutive plan years ending with the plan year preceding the plan year in which the withdrawal occurs) for which such required contributions were the highest.
<br>
<br>(II) Subparagraph (B) shall not apply to any plan year to which this clause applies.
<br>
<br>(III) This clause shall not apply in the case of any withdrawal described in subparagraph (D).
<br>
<br>(IV) If under a plan this clause applies to any plan year but does not apply to the next plan year, this clause shall not apply to any plan year after such next plan year.
<br>
<br>(V) For purposes of this clause, the term "required contributions" means, for any period, the amounts which the employer was obligated to contribute for such period (not taking into account any delinquent contribution for any other period).
<br>
<br>(iii) A plan may be amended to provide that for the first plan year ending on or after September 26, 1980, the number "5" shall be substituted for the number "10" each place it appears in clause (i) or clause (ii) (whichever is appropriate). If the plan is so amended, the number "5" shall be increased by one for each succeeding plan year until the number "10" is reached.
<br>
<br>(D) In any case in which a multiemployer plan terminates by the withdrawal of every employer from the plan, or in which substantially all the employers withdraw from a plan pursuant to an agreement or arrangement to withdraw from the plan—
<br>
<br>(i) the liability of each such employer who has withdrawn shall be determined (or redetermined) under this paragraph without regard to subparagraph (B), and
<br>
<br>(ii) notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the total unfunded vested benefits of the plan shall be fully allocated among all such employers in a manner not inconsistent with regulations which shall be prescribed by the corporation.
<br>
<br>Withdrawal by an employer from a plan, during a period of 3 consecutive plan years within which substantially all the employers who have an obligation to contribute under the plan withdraw, shall be presumed to be a withdrawal pursuant to an agreement or arrangement, unless the employer proves otherwise by a preponderance of the evidence.
<br>
<br>(E) In the case of a partial withdrawal described in section 1385(a) of this title, the amount of each annual payment shall be the product of—
<br>
<br>(i) the amount determined under subparagraph (C) (determined without regard to this subparagraph), multiplied by
<br>
<br>(ii) the fraction determined under section 1386(a)(2) of this title.
<br>
<br>(2) Withdrawal liability shall be payable in accordance with the schedule set forth by the plan sponsor under subsection (b)(1) beginning no later than 60 days after the date of the demand notwithstanding any request for review or appeal of determinations of the amount of such liability or of the schedule.
<br>
<br>(3) Each annual payment determined under paragraph (1)(C) shall be payable in 4 equal installments due quarterly, or at other intervals specified by plan rules. If a payment is not made when due, interest on the payment shall accrue from the due date until the date on which the payment is made.
<br>
<br>(4) The employer shall be entitled to prepay the outstanding amount of the unpaid annual withdrawal liability payments determined under paragraph (1)(C), plus accrued interest, if any, in whole or in part, without penalty. If the prepayment is made pursuant to a withdrawal which is later determined to be part of a withdrawal described in paragraph (1)(D), the withdrawal liability of the employer shall not be limited to the amount of the prepayment.
<br>
<br>(5) In the event of a default, a plan sponsor may require immediate payment of the outstanding amount of an employer's withdrawal liability, plus accrued interest on the total outstanding liability from the due date of the first payment which was not timely made. For purposes of this section, the term "default" means—
<br>
<br>(A) the failure of an employer to make, when due, any payment under this section, if the failure is not cured within 60 days after the employer receives written notification from the plan sponsor of such failure, and
<br>
<br>(B) any other event defined in rules adopted by the plan which indicates a substantial likelihood that an employer will be unable to pay its withdrawal liability.
<br>
<br>(6) Except as provided in paragraph (1)(A)(ii), interest under this subsection shall be charged at rates based on prevailing market rates for comparable obligations, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the corporation.
<br>
<br>(7) A multiemployer plan may adopt rules for other terms and conditions for the satisfaction of an employer's withdrawal liability if such rules—
<br>
<br>(A) are consistent with this chapter, and
<br>
<br>(B) are not inconsistent with regulations of the corporation.
<br>
<br>(8) In the case of a terminated multiemployer plan, an employer's obligation to make payments under this section ceases at the end of the plan year in which the assets of the plan (exclusive of withdrawal liability claims) are sufficient to meet all obligations of the plan, as determined by the corporation.
<br>(d) Applicability of statutory prohibitions
<br>
<br>The prohibitions provided in section 1106(a) of this title do not apply to any action required or permitted under this part or to any arrangement relating to withdrawal liability involving the plan.

<br>§1401. Resolution of disputes
<br>(a) Arbitration proceedings; matters subject to arbitration, procedures applicable, etc.
<br>
<br>(1) Any dispute between an employer and the plan sponsor of a multiemployer plan concerning a determination made under sections 1381 through 1399 of this title shall be resolved through arbitration. Either party may initiate the arbitration proceeding within a 60-day period after the earlier of—
<br>
<br>(A) the date of notification to the employer under section 1399(b)(2)(B) of this title, or
<br>
<br>(B) 120 days after the date of the employer's request under section 1399(b)(2)(A) of this title.
<br>
<br>The parties may jointly initiate arbitration within the 180-day period after the date of the plan sponsor's demand under section 1399(b)(1) of this title.
<br>
<br>(2) An arbitration proceeding under this section shall be conducted in accordance with fair and equitable procedures to be promulgated by the corporation. The plan sponsor may purchase insurance to cover potential liability of the arbitrator. If the parties have not provided for the costs of the arbitration, including arbitrator's fees, by agreement, the arbitrator shall assess such fees. The arbitrator may also award reasonable attorney's fees.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) For purposes of any proceeding under this section, any determination made by a plan sponsor under sections 1381 through 1399 of this title and section 1405 of this title is presumed correct unless the party contesting the determination shows by a preponderance of the evidence that the determination was unreasonable or clearly erroneous.
<br>
<br>(B) In the case of the determination of a plan's unfunded vested benefits for a plan year, the determination is presumed correct unless a party contesting the determination shows by a preponderance of evidence that—
<br>
<br>(i) the actuarial assumptions and methods used in the determination were, in the aggregate, unreasonable (taking into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations), or
<br>
<br>(ii) the plan's actuary made a significant error in applying the actuarial assumptions or methods.
<br>(b) Alternative collection proceedings; civil action subsequent to arbitration award; conduct of arbitration proceedings
<br>
<br>(1) If no arbitration proceeding has been initiated pursuant to subsection (a), the amounts demanded by the plan sponsor under section 1399(b)(1) of this title shall be due and owing on the schedule set forth by the plan sponsor. The plan sponsor may bring an action in a State or Federal court of competent jurisdiction for collection.
<br>
<br>(2) Upon completion of the arbitration proceedings in favor of one of the parties, any party thereto may bring an action, no later than 30 days after the issuance of an arbitrator's award, in an appropriate United States district court in accordance with section 1451 of this title to enforce, vacate, or modify the arbitrator's award.
<br>
<br>(3) Any arbitration proceedings under this section shall, to the extent consistent with this subchapter, be conducted in the same manner, subject to the same limitations, carried out with the same powers (including subpena power), and enforced in United States courts as an arbitration proceeding carried out under title 9.
<br>(c) Presumption respecting finding of fact by arbitrator
<br>
<br>In any proceeding under subsection (b), there shall be a presumption, rebuttable only by a clear preponderance of the evidence, that the findings of fact made by the arbitrator were correct.
<br>(d) Payments by employer prior and subsequent to determination by arbitrator; adjustments; failure of employer to make payments
<br>
<br>Payments shall be made by an employer in accordance with the determinations made under this part until the arbitrator issues a final decision with respect to the determination submitted for arbitration, with any necessary adjustments in subsequent payments for overpayments or underpayments arising out of the decision of the arbitrator with respect to the determination. If the employer fails to make timely payment in accordance with such final decision, the employer shall be treated as being delinquent in the making of a contribution required under the plan (within the meaning of section 1145 of this title).
<br>(e) Procedures applicable to certain disputes
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>If—
<br>
<br>(A) a plan sponsor of a plan determines that—
<br>
<br>(i) a complete or partial withdrawal of an employer has occurred, or
<br>
<br>(ii) an employer is liable for withdrawal liability payments with respect to the complete or partial withdrawal of an employer from the plan,
<br>
<br>(B) such determination is based in whole or in part on a finding by the plan sponsor under section 1392(c) of this title that a principal purpose of a transaction that occurred before January 1, 1999, was to evade or avoid withdrawal liability under this subtitle, and
<br>
<br>(C) such transaction occurred at least 5 years before the date of the complete or partial withdrawal,
<br>
<br>then the special rules under paragraph (2) shall be used in applying subsections (a) and (d) of this section and section 1399(c) of this title to the employer.
<br>(2) Special rules
<br>(A) Determination
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding subsection (a)(3)—
<br>
<br>(i) a determination by the plan sponsor under paragraph (1)(B) shall not be presumed to be correct, and
<br>
<br>(ii) the plan sponsor shall have the burden to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, the elements of the claim under section 1392(c) of this title that a principal purpose of the transaction was to evade or avoid withdrawal liability under this subtitle.
<br>
<br>Nothing in this subparagraph shall affect the burden of establishing any other element of a claim for withdrawal liability under this subtitle.
<br>(B) Procedure
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding subsection (d) and section 1399(c) of this title, if an employer contests the plan sponsor's determination under paragraph (1) through an arbitration proceeding pursuant to subsection (a), or through a claim brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, the employer shall not be obligated to make any withdrawal liability payments until a final decision in the arbitration proceeding, or in court, upholds the plan sponsor's determination.
<br>(f) Procedures applicable to certain disputes
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—If—
<br>
<br>(A) a plan sponsor of a plan determines that—
<br>
<br>(i) a complete or partial withdrawal of an employer has occurred, or
<br>
<br>(ii) an employer is liable for withdrawal liability payments with respect to such complete or partial withdrawal, and
<br>
<br>(B) such determination is based in whole or in part on a finding by the plan sponsor under section 1392(c) of this title that a principal purpose of any transaction which occurred after December 31, 1998, and at least 5 years (2 years in the case of a small employer) before the date of the complete or partial withdrawal was to evade or avoid withdrawal liability under this subtitle,
<br>
<br>then the person against which the withdrawal liability is assessed based solely on the application of section 1392(c) of this title may elect to use the special rule under paragraph (2) in applying subsection (d) of this section and section 1399(c) of this title to such person.
<br>
<br>(2) Special rule.—Notwithstanding subsection (d) and section 1399(c) of this title, if an electing person contests the plan sponsor's determination with respect to withdrawal liability payments under paragraph (1) through an arbitration proceeding pursuant to subsection (a), through an action brought in a court of competent jurisdiction for review of such an arbitration decision, or as otherwise permitted by law, the electing person shall not be obligated to make the withdrawal liability payments until a final decision in the arbitration proceeding, or in court, upholds the plan sponsor's determination, but only if the electing person—
<br>
<br>(A) provides notice to the plan sponsor of its election to apply the special rule in this paragraph within 90 days after the plan sponsor notifies the electing person of its liability by reason of the application of section 1392(c) of this title; and
<br>
<br>(B) if a final decision in the arbitration proceeding, or in court, of the withdrawal liability dispute has not been rendered within 12 months from the date of such notice, the electing person provides to the plan, effective as of the first day following the 12-month period, a bond issued by a corporate surety company that is an acceptable surety for purposes of section 1112 of this title, or an amount held in escrow by a bank or similar financial institution satisfactory to the plan, in an amount equal to the sum of the withdrawal liability payments that would otherwise be due under subsection (d) and section 1399(c) of this title for the 12-month period beginning with the first anniversary of such notice. Such bond or escrow shall remain in effect until there is a final decision in the arbitration proceeding, or in court, of the withdrawal liability dispute, at which time such bond or escrow shall be paid to the plan if such final decision upholds the plan sponsor's determination.
<br>
<br>(3) Definition of small employer.—For purposes of this subsection—
<br>
<br>(A) In general.—The term "small employer" means any employer which, for the calendar year in which the transaction referred to in paragraph (1)(B) occurred and for each of the 3 preceding years, on average—
<br>
<br>(i) employs not more than 500 employees, and
<br>
<br>(ii) is required to make contributions to the plan for not more than 250 employees.
<br>
<br>(B) Controlled group.—Any group treated as a single employer under subsection (b)(1) of section 1301 of this title, without regard to any transaction that was a basis for the plan's finding under section 1392 of this title, shall be treated as a single employer for purposes of this subparagraph.
<br>

<br>
<br>(1) is established and maintained under section 501(c)(22) of title 26,
<br>

<br>
<br>(4) is administered by a Board of Trustees, and in the administration of the fund there is equal representation of—
<br>

<br>
<br>(B) trustees representing employees who are participants in plans which participate in the fund.
<br>(c) Payments to plan; amount, criteria, etc.
<br>
<br>(1) If an employer withdraws from a plan which participates in a withdrawal liability payment fund, then, to the extent provided in the trust, the fund shall pay to that plan—
<br>
<br>(A) the employer's unattributable liability,
<br>
<br>(B) the employer's withdrawal liability payments which would have been due but for section 1388, 1389, 1399, or 1405 of this title,
<br>
<br>(C) the employer's withdrawal liability payments to the extent they are uncollectible.
<br>
<br>(2) The fund may provide for the payment of the employer's attributable liability if the fund—
<br>
<br>(A) provides for the payment of both the attributable and the unattributable liability of the employer in a single payment, and
<br>
<br>(B) is subrogated to all rights of the plan against the employer.
<br>
<br>(3) For purposes of this section, the term—
<br>
<br>(A) "attributable liability" means the excess, if any, determined under the provisions of a plan not inconsistent with regulations of the corporation, of—
<br>
<br>(i) the value of vested benefits accrued as a result of service with the employer, over
<br>
<br>(ii) the value of plan assets attributed to the employer, and
<br>
<br>(B) "unattributable liability" means the excess of withdrawal liability over attributable liability.
<br>
<br>Such terms may be further defined, and the manner in which they shall be applied may be prescribed, by the corporation by regulation.
<br>
<br>(4)(A) The trust of a fund shall be maintained for the exclusive purpose of paying—
<br>
<br>(i) any amount described in paragraph (1) and paragraph (2), and
<br>
<br>(ii) reasonable and necessary administrative expenses in connection with the establishment and operation of the trust and the processing of claims against the fund.
<br>
<br>(B) The amounts paid by a plan to a fund shall be deemed a reasonable expense of administering the plan under sections 1103(c)(1) and 1104(a)(1)(A)(ii) of this title, and the payments made by a fund to a participating plan shall be deemed services necessary for the operation of the plan within the meaning of section 1108(b)(2) of this title or within the meaning of section 4975(d)(2) of title 26.
<br>(d) Application of payments by plan
<br>
<br>(1) For purposes of this part—
<br>
<br>(A) only amounts paid by the fund to a plan under subsection (c)(1)(A) shall be credited to withdrawal liability otherwise payable by the employer, unless the plan otherwise provides, and
<br>
<br>(B) any amounts paid by the fund under subsection (c) to a plan shall be treated by the plan as a payment of withdrawal liability to such plan.
<br>
<br>(2) For purposes of applying provisions relating to the funding standard accounts (and minimum contribution requirements), amounts paid from the plan to the fund shall be applied to reduce the amount treated as contributed to the plan.
<br>(e) Subrogation of fund to rights of plan
<br>
<br>The fund shall be subrogated to the rights of the plan against the employer that has withdrawn from the plan for amounts paid by a fund to a plan under—

<br>
<br>(2) subsection (c)(1)(C).

The provisions of the preceding sentence shall supersede any and all State laws relating to fiduciaries insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to a fund to which this section applies.
<br>(g) Prohibition on payments from fund to plan where certain labor negotiations involve employer withdrawn or partially withdrawn from plan and continuity of labor organization representing employees continues
<br>
<br>No payments shall be made from a fund to a plan on the occasion of a withdrawal or partial withdrawal of an employer from such plan if the employees representing the withdrawn contribution base units continue, after such withdrawal, to be represented under section 159 of this title (or other applicable labor laws) in negotiations with such employer by the labor organization which represented such employees immediately preceding such withdrawal.
<br>(h) Purchase of insurance by employer
<br>
<br>Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the purchase of insurance by an employer from any other person, to limit the circumstances under which such insurance would be payable, or to limit in any way the terms and conditions of such insurance.
<br>(i) Promulgation of regulations for establishment and maintenance of fund
<br>
<br>The corporation may provide by regulation rules not inconsistent with this section governing the establishment and maintenance of funds, but only to the extent necessary to carry out the purposes of this part (other than section 1402 of this title).

<br>part 2—merger or transfer of plan assets or liabilities
<br>§1411. Mergers and transfers between multiemployer plans
<br>(a) Authority of plan sponsor
<br>
<br>Unless otherwise provided in regulations prescribed by the corporation, a plan sponsor may not cause a multiemployer plan to merge with one or more multiemployer plans, or engage in a transfer of assets and liabilities to or from another multiemployer plan, unless such merger or transfer satisfies the requirements of subsection (b).
<br>(b) Criteria
<br>
<br>A merger or transfer satisfies the requirements of this section if—
<br>
<br>(1) in accordance with regulations of the corporation, the plan sponsor of a multiemployer plan notifies the corporation of a merger with or transfer of plan assets or liabilities to another multiemployer plan at least 120 days before the effective date of the merger or transfer;
<br>
<br>(2) no participant's or beneficiary's accrued benefit will be lower immediately after the effective date of the merger or transfer than the benefit immediately before that date;
<br>
<br>(3) the benefits of participants and beneficiaries are not reasonably expected to be subject to suspension under section 1426 of this title; and
<br>
<br>(4) an actuarial valuation of the assets and liabilities of each of the affected plans has been performed during the plan year preceding the effective date of the merger or transfer, based upon the most recent data available as of the day before the start of that plan year, or other valuation of such assets and liabilities performed under such standards and procedures as the corporation may prescribe by regulation.
<br>(c) Actions not deemed violation of section 1106(a) or (b)(2) of this title
<br>
<br>The merger of multiemployer plans or the transfer of assets or liabilities between multiemployer plans, shall be deemed not to constitute a violation of the provisions of section 1106(a) of this title or section 1106(b)(2) of this title if the corporation determines that the merger or transfer otherwise satisfies the requirements of this section.
<br>(d) Nature of plan to which liabilities are transferred
<br>
<br>A plan to which liabilities are transferred under this section is a successor plan for purposes of section 1322a(b)(2)(B) of this title.
<br>(e) Facilitated mergers
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>When requested to do so by the plan sponsors, the corporation may take such actions as it deems appropriate to promote and facilitate the merger of two or more multiemployer plans if it determines, after consultation with the Participant and Plan Sponsor Advocate selected under section 1304 of this title, that the transaction is in the interests of the participants and beneficiaries of at least one of the plans and is not reasonably expected to be adverse to the overall interests of the participants and beneficiaries of any of the plans. Such facilitation may include training, technical assistance, mediation, communication with stakeholders, and support with related requests to other government agencies.
<br>(2) Financial assistance
<br>
<br>In order to facilitate a merger which it determines is necessary to enable one or more of the plans involved to avoid or postpone insolvency, the corporation may provide financial assistance (within the meaning of section 1431 of this title) to the merged plan if—
<br>
<br>(A) one or more of the multiemployer plans participating in the merger is in critical and declining status (as defined in section 1085(b)(4) of this title);
<br>
<br>(B) the corporation reasonably expects that—
<br>
<br>(i) such financial assistance will reduce the corporation's expected long-term loss with respect to the plans involved; and
<br>
<br>(ii) such financial assistance is necessary for the merged plan to become or remain solvent;
<br>
<br>(C) the corporation certifies that its ability to meet existing financial assistance obligations to other plans will not be impaired by such financial assistance; and
<br>
<br>(D) such financial assistance is paid exclusively from the fund for basic benefits guaranteed for multiemployer plans.
<br>
<br>Not later than 14 days after the provision of such financial assistance, the corporation shall provide notice of such financial assistance to the Committee on Education and the Workforce of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Finance of the Senate, and the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate.

<br>(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), a multiemployer plan which transfers liabilities to a single-employer plan shall be liable to the corporation if the single-employer plan terminates within 60 months after the effective date of the transfer. The amount of liability shall be the lesser of—
<br>
<br>(A) the amount of the plan asset insufficiency of the terminated single-employer plan, less 30 percent of the net worth of the employer who maintained the single-employer plan, determined in accordance with section 1362 or 1364 of this title, or
<br>
<br>(B) the value, on the effective date of the transfer, of the unfunded benefits transferred to the single-employer plan which are guaranteed under section 1322 of this title.
<br>
<br>(2) A multiemployer plan shall be liable to the corporation as provided in paragraph (1) unless, within 180 days after the corporation receives an application (together with such information as the corporation may reasonably require for purposes of such application) from the multiemployer plan sponsor for a determination under this paragraph—
<br>
<br>(A) the corporation determines that the interests of the plan participants and beneficiaries and of the corporation are adequately protected, or
<br>
<br>(B) fails to make any determination regarding the adequacy with which such interests are protected with respect to such transfer of liabilities.
<br>
<br>If, after the receipt of such application, the corporation requests from the plan sponsor additional information necessary for the determination, the running of the 180-day period shall be suspended from the date of such request until the receipt by the corporation of the additional information requested. The corporation may by regulation prescribe procedures and standards for the issuance of determinations under this paragraph. This paragraph shall not apply to any application submitted less than 180 days after September 26, 1980.
<br>
<br>(3) A multiemployer plan shall not be liable to the corporation as provided in paragraph (1) in the case of a transfer from the multiemployer plan to a single-employer plan of liabilities which accrued under a single-employer plan which merged with the multiemployer plan, if, the value of liabilities transferred to the single-employer plan does not exceed the value of the liabilities for benefits which accrued before the merger, and the value of the assets transferred to the single-employer plan is substantially equal to the value of the assets which would have been in the single-employer plan if the employer had maintained and funded it as a separate plan under which no benefits accrued after the date of the merger.
<br>
<br>(4) The corporation may make equitable arrangements with multiemployer plans which are liable under this subsection for satisfaction of their liability.
<br>(d) Guarantee of benefits under single-employer plan
<br>
<br>Benefits under a single-employer plan to which liabilities are transferred in accordance with this section are guaranteed under section 1322 of this title to the extent provided in that section as of the effective date of the transfer and the plan is a successor plan.
<br>(e) Transfer of liabilities by multiemployer plan to single-employer plan
<br>
<br>(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), a multiemployer plan may not transfer liabilities to a single-employer plan unless the plan sponsor of the plan to which the liabilities would be transferred agrees to the transfer.
<br>
<br>(2) In the case of a transfer described in subsection (c)(3), paragraph (1) of this subsection is satisfied by the advance agreement to the transfer by the employer who will be obligated to contribute to the single-employer plan.
<br>(f) Additional requirements by corporation for protection of interests of plan participants, beneficiaries and corporation; approval by corporation of transfer of assets or liabilities to single-employer plan from plan in reorganization; covered transfers in connection with termination
<br>
<br>(1) The corporation may prescribe by regulation such additional requirements with respect to the transfer of assets or liabilities as may be necessary to protect the interests of plan participants and beneficiaries and the corporation.
<br>
<br>(2) Except as otherwise determined by the corporation, a transfer of assets or liabilities to a single-employer plan from a plan in reorganization under section 1421 1 of this title is not effective unless the corporation approves such transfer.
<br>
<br>(3) No transfer to which this section applies, in connection with a termination described in section 1341a(a)(2) of this title shall be effective unless the transfer meets such requirements as may be established by the corporation to prevent an increase in the risk of loss to the corporation.

<br>§1413. Partitions of eligible multiemployer plans
<br>(a) Authority of corporation
<br>
<br>(1) Upon the application by the plan sponsor of an eligible multiemployer plan for a partition of the plan, the corporation may order a partition of the plan in accordance with this section. The corporation shall make a determination regarding the application not later than 270 days after the date such application was filed (or, if later, the date such application was completed) in accordance with regulations promulgated by the corporation.
<br>
<br>(2) Not later than 30 days after submitting an application for partition of a plan under paragraph (1), the plan sponsor of the plan shall notify the participants and beneficiaries of such application, in the form and manner prescribed by regulations issued by the corporation.
<br>(b) Eligible multiemployer plans
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, a multiemployer plan is an eligible multiemployer plan if—
<br>
<br>(1) the plan is in critical and declining status (as defined in section 1085(b)(4) of this title);
<br>
<br>(2) the corporation determines, after consultation with the Participant and Plan Sponsor Advocate selected under section 1304 of this title, that the plan sponsor has taken (or is taking concurrently with an application for partition) all reasonable measures to avoid insolvency, including the maximum benefit suspensions under section 1085(e)(9) of this title, if applicable;
<br>
<br>(3) the corporation reasonably expects that—
<br>
<br>(A) a partition of the plan will reduce the corporation's expected long-term loss with respect to the plan; and
<br>
<br>(B) a partition of the plan is necessary for the plan to remain solvent;
<br>
<br>(4) the corporation certifies to Congress that its ability to meet existing financial assistance obligations to other plans (including any liabilities associated with multiemployer plans that are insolvent or that are projected to become insolvent within 10 years) will not be impaired by such partition; and
<br>
<br>(5) the cost to the corporation arising from such partition is paid exclusively from the fund for basic benefits guaranteed for multiemployer plans.
<br>(c) Transfer of liabilities
<br>
<br>The corporation's partition order shall provide for a transfer to the plan referenced in subsection (d)(1) of the minimum amount of the plan's liabilities necessary for the plan to remain solvent.
<br>(d) Plans created by partition orders
<br>
<br>(1) The plan created by the partition order is a successor plan to which section 1322a of this title applies.
<br>
<br>(2) The plan sponsor of an eligible multiemployer plan prior to the partition and the administrator of such plan shall be the plan sponsor and the administrator, respectively, of the plan created by the partition order.
<br>
<br>(3) In the event an employer withdraws from the plan that was partitioned within ten years following the date of the partition order, withdrawal liability shall be computed under section 1381 of this title with respect to both the plan that was partitioned and the plan created by the partition order. If the withdrawal occurs more than ten years after the date of the partition order, withdrawal liability shall be computed under section 1381 of this title only with respect to the plan that was partitioned (and not with respect to the plan created by the partition order).
<br>(e) Payment of benefits and premiums for beneficiaries of partitioned plans
<br>
<br>(1) For each participant or beneficiary of the plan whose benefit was transferred to the plan created by the partition order pursuant to a partition, the plan that was partitioned shall pay a monthly benefit to such participant or beneficiary for each month in which such benefit is in pay status following the effective date of such partition in an amount equal to the excess of—
<br>
<br>(A) the monthly benefit that would be paid to such participant or beneficiary for such month under the terms of the plan (taking into account benefit suspensions under section 1085(e)(9) of this title and any plan amendments following the effective date of such partition) if the partition had not occurred, over
<br>
<br>(B) the monthly benefit for such participant or beneficiary which is guaranteed under section 1322a of this title.
<br>
<br>(2) In any case in which a plan provides a benefit improvement (as defined in section 1085(e)(9)(E)(vi) of this title) that takes effect after the effective date of the partition, the plan shall pay to the corporation for each year during the 10-year period following the partition effective date, an annual amount equal to the lesser of—
<br>
<br>(A) the total value of the increase in benefit payments for such year that is attributable to the benefit improvement, or
<br>
<br>(B) the total benefit payments from the plan created by the partition for such year.
<br>
<br>Such payment shall be made at the time of, and in addition to, any other premium imposed by the corporation under this subchapter.
<br>
<br>(3) The plan that was partitioned shall pay the premiums imposed by the corporation under this subchapter with respect to participants whose benefits were transferred to the plan created by the partition order for each year during the 10-year period following the partition effective date.
<br>(f) Notice of partition orders to Congress
<br>
<br>Not later than 14 days after the partition order, the corporation shall provide notice of such order to the Committee on Education and the Workforce of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Finance of the Senate, the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate, and any affected participants or beneficiaries.

<br>§1414. Asset transfer rules
<br>(a) Applicability and scope
<br>
<br>A transfer of assets from a multiemployer plan to another plan shall comply with asset-transfer rules which shall be adopted by the multiemployer plan and which—
<br>
<br>(1) do not unreasonably restrict the transfer of plan assets in connection with the transfer of plan liabilities, and
<br>
<br>(2) operate and are applied uniformly with respect to each proposed transfer, except that the rules may provide for reasonable variations taking into account the potential financial impact of a proposed transfer on the multiemployer plan.
