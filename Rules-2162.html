<br>§2001. Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) the United States does not have a clearly defined policy for United States noncontiguous Pacific areas (including the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, Guam, the State of Hawaii, and the State of Alaska) and for United States-associated noncontiguous Pacific areas (including the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau);
<br>
<br>(2) the Federal Government has often failed to consider the implications for, effects on, and potential of noncontiguous Pacific areas in the formulation and conduct of foreign and domestic policy, to the detriment of both the attainment of the objectives of Federal policy and noncontiguous Pacific areas;
<br>
<br>(3) policies and programs designed for the United States as a whole may impose inappropriate standards on noncontiguous Pacific areas because of their unique circumstances and needs; and
<br>
<br>(4) the present Federal organizational arrangements for liaison with (and providing assistance to) the insular areas may not be adequate—
<br>
<br>(A) to coordinate the delivery of Federal programs and services to noncontiguous Pacific areas;
<br>
<br>(B) to provide a consistent basis for administration of programs;
<br>
<br>(C) to adapt policy to the special requirements of each area and modify the application of Federal programs, laws, and regulations accordingly;
<br>
<br>(D) to be responsive to the Congress in the discharge of its responsibilities; and
<br>
<br>(E) to attain the international obligations of the United States.

<br>§2002. Reports
<br>(a) Submission
<br>
<br>Not later than one year after January 14, 1986, and each five years thereafter, the Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall submit to the Congress and the President a report on United States noncontiguous Pacific areas policy together with such recommendations as may be necessary to accomplish the objectives of such policy.
<br>(b) Contents
<br>
<br>The reports required in subsection (a) of this section shall set forth clearly defined policies regarding United States, and United States associated, noncontiguous Pacific areas, including—
<br>
<br>(1) the role of and impacts on the noncontiguous Pacific areas in the formulation and conduct of foreign policy;
<br>
<br>(2) the applicability of standards contained in Federal laws, regulations, and programs to the noncontiguous Pacific areas and any modifications which may be necessary to achieve the intent of such laws, regulations, and programs consistent with the unique character of the noncontiguous Pacific areas;
<br>
<br>(3) the effectiveness of the Federal executive organizational arrangements for—
<br>
<br>(A) providing liaison between the Federal Government and the governments of the noncontiguous Pacific areas;
<br>
<br>(B) coordinating Federal actions in a manner which recognizes the unique circumstances and needs of the noncontiguous Pacific areas; and
<br>
<br>(C) achieving the objective of Federal policy and ensuring that the Congress receives the information necessary to discharge its responsibilities; and
<br>
<br>(4) actions which may be needed to facilitate the economic and social health and development of the noncontiguous Pacific areas, consistent with their self-determined objectives.

<br>
<br>(F) In the event of a vacancy of a Category A, B, C, D, or E Board seat, the corresponding congressional leader referenced in subparagraph (A) shall submit a list pursuant to this subsection within a timely manner of the Board member's resignation or removal becoming effective.
