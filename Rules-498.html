<br>§2113. Eligibility of officers for consideration for promotion
<br>
<br>(a) An officer on the active duty promotion list becomes eligible for consideration for promotion to the next higher grade at the beginning of the promotion year in which he completes the following amount of service computed from his date of rank in the grade in which he is serving:
<br>
<br>(1) two years in the grade of lieutenant (junior grade);
<br>
<br>(2) three years in the grade of lieutenant;
<br>
<br>(3) four years in the grade of lieutenant commander;
<br>
<br>(4) four years in the grade of commander; and
<br>
<br>(5) three years in the grade of captain.
<br>
<br>(b) For the purpose of this section, service in a grade includes all qualifying service in that grade or a higher grade, under either a temporary or permanent appointment. However, service in a grade under a temporary service appointment under section 2125 of this title is considered as service only in the grade that the officer concerned would have held had he not been so appointed.
<br>
<br>(c) No officer may become eligible for consideration for promotion until all officers of his grade senior to him are so eligible.
<br>
<br>(d) Except when his name is on a list of selectees, each officer who becomes eligible for consideration for promotion to the next higher grade remains eligible so long as he—
<br>
<br>(1) continues on active duty; and
<br>
<br>(2) is not promoted to that grade.
<br>
<br>(e) An officer whose involuntary retirement or separation is deferred under section 2156 of this title is not eligible for consideration for promotion to the next higher grade during the period of that deferment.
<br>
<br>(f) The Secretary may waive subsection (a) to the extent necessary to allow officers described therein to have at least two opportunities for consideration for promotion to the next higher grade as officers below the promotion zone.
<br>
<br>(g)(1) Notwithstanding subsection (a), the Commandant may provide that an officer may, upon the officer's request and with the approval of the Commandant, be excluded from consideration by a selection board convened under section 2106.
<br>
<br>(2) The Commandant shall approve a request under paragraph (1) only if—
<br>
<br>(A) the basis for the request is to allow the officer to complete a broadening assignment, advanced education, another assignment of significant value to the Coast Guard, a career progression requirement delayed by the assignment or education, or a qualifying personal or professional circumstance, as determined by the Commandant;
<br>
<br>(B) the Commandant determines the exclusion from consideration is in the best interest of the Coast Guard; and
<br>
<br>(C) the officer has not previously failed of selection for promotion to the grade for which the officer requests the exclusion from consideration.

The number of officers that a board may recommend to be placed at the top of the list of selectees may not exceed the percentages set forth in subsection (b) unless such a percentage is a number less than one, in which case the board may recommend one officer for such placement.

<br>§2120. Special selection boards; correction of errors
<br>
<br>(a) Officers Not Considered Due to Administrative Error.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—If the Secretary determines that as the result of an administrative error—
<br>
<br>(A) an officer or former officer was not considered for selection for promotion by a selection board convened under section 2106; or
<br>
<br>(B) the name of an officer or former officer was not placed on an all-fully-qualified-officers list;
<br>
<br>the Secretary shall convene a special selection board to determine whether such officer or former officer should be recommended for promotion and such officer or former officer shall not be considered to have failed of selection for promotion prior to the consideration of the special selection board.
<br>
<br>(2) Effect of failure to recommend for promotion.—If a special selection board convened under paragraph (1) does not recommend for promotion an officer or former officer, whose grade is below the grade of captain and whose name was referred to that board for consideration, the officer or former officer shall be considered to have failed of selection for promotion.
<br>
<br>(b) Officers Considered But Not Selected; Material Error.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—In the case of an officer or former officer who was eligible for promotion, was considered for selection for promotion by a selection board convened under section 2106, and was not selected for promotion by that board, the Secretary may convene a special selection board to determine whether the officer or former officer should be recommended for promotion, if the Secretary determines that—
<br>
<br>(A) an action of the selection board that considered the officer or former officer—
<br>
<br>(i) was contrary to law in a matter material to the decision of the board; or
<br>
<br>(ii) involved material error of fact or material administrative error; or
<br>
<br>(B) the selection board that considered the officer or former officer did not have before it for consideration material information.
<br>
<br>(2) Effect of failure to recommend for promotion.—If a special selection board convened under paragraph (1) does not recommend for promotion an officer or former officer, whose grade is that of commander or below and whose name was referred to that board for consideration, the officer or former officer shall be considered—
<br>
<br>(A) to have failed of selection for promotion with respect to the board that considered the officer or former officer prior to the consideration of the special selection board; and
<br>
<br>(B) to incur no additional failure of selection for promotion as a result of the action of the special selection board.
<br>
<br>(c) Requirements for Special Selection Boards.—Each special selection board convened under this section shall—
<br>
<br>(1) be composed in accordance with section 2107 and the members of the board shall be required to swear the oaths described in section 2109;
<br>
<br>(2) consider the record of an applicable officer or former officer as that record, if corrected, would have appeared to the selection board that should have considered or did consider the officer or former officer prior to the consideration of the special selection board and that record shall be compared with a sampling of the records of—
<br>
<br>(A) those officers of the same grade who were recommended for promotion by such prior selection board; and
<br>
<br>(B) those officers of the same grade who were not recommended for promotion by such prior selection board; and
<br>
<br>(3) submit to the Secretary a written report in a manner consistent with sections 2117 and 2118.
<br>
<br>(d) Appointment of Officers Recommended for Promotion.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—An officer or former officer whose name is placed on a promotion list as a result of the recommendation of a special selection board convened under this section shall be appointed, as soon as practicable, to the next higher grade in accordance with the law and policies that would have been applicable to the officer or former officer had the officer or former officer been recommended for promotion by the selection board that should have considered or did consider the officer or former officer prior to the consideration of the special selection board.

<br>(g) Judicial Review.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—A court of the United States may review—
<br>
<br>(A) a decision of the Secretary not to convene a special selection board under this section to determine if the court finds that the decision of the Secretary was arbitrary or capricious, not based on substantial evidence, or otherwise contrary to law; and
<br>
<br>(B) an action of a special selection board under this section to determine if the court finds that the action of the special selection board was contrary to law or involved material error of fact or material administrative error.
