<br>§3801. Findings and purpose
<br>
<br>(a) The Congress hereby finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) increasingly volatile and dynamic changes in interest rates have seriously impared 1 the ability of housing creditors to provide consumers with fixed-term, fixed-rate credit secured by interests in real property, cooperative housing, manufactured homes, and other dwellings;
<br>
<br>(2) alternative mortgage transactions are essential to the provision of an adequate supply of credit secured by residential property necessary to meet the demand expected during the 1980's; and
<br>
<br>(3) the Comptroller of the Currency, the National Credit Union Administration, and the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision have recognized the importance of alternative mortgage transactions and have adopted regulations authorizing federally chartered depository institutions to engage in alternative mortgage financing.
<br>
<br>(b) It is the purpose of this chapter to eliminate the discriminatory impact that those regulations have upon nonfederally chartered housing creditors and provide them with parity with federally chartered institutions by authorizing all housing creditors to make, purchase, and enforce alternative mortgage transactions so long as the transactions are in conformity with the regulations issued by the Federal agencies.

<br>1 So in original. Probably should be "impaired".
<br>§3802. Definitions
<br>
<br>As used in this chapter—
<br>
<br>(1) the term "alternative mortgage transaction" means a loan or credit sale secured by an interest in residential real property, a dwelling, all stock allocated to a dwelling unit in a residential cooperative housing corporation, or a residential manufactured home (as that term is defined in section 5402(6) of title 42), in which the interest rate or finance charge may be adjusted or renegotiated, described and defined by applicable regulation; and
<br>
<br>(2) the term "housing creditor" means—
<br>
<br>(A) a depository institution, as defined in section 501(a)(2) of the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980;
<br>
<br>(B) a lender approved by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development for participation in any mortgage insurance program under the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.];
<br>
<br>(C) any person who regularly makes loans, credit sales, or advances secured by interests in properties referred to in paragraph (1); or
<br>
<br>(D) any transferee of any of them.
<br>
<br>A person is not a "housing creditor" with respect to a specific alternative mortgage transaction if, except for this chapter, in order to enter into that transaction, the person would be required to comply with licensing requirements imposed under State law, unless such person is licensed under applicable State law and such person remains, or becomes, subject to the applicable regulatory requirements and enforcement mechanisms provided by State law.

<br>§3803. Alternative mortgage authority
<br>(a) General authority; compliance by banks, credit unions and all other housing creditors with applicable regulations
<br>
<br>In order to prevent discrimination against State-chartered depository institutions, and other nonfederally chartered housing creditors, with respect to making, purchasing, and enforcing alternative mortgage transactions, housing creditors may make, purchase, and enforce alternative mortgage transactions, except that this section shall apply—
<br>
<br>(1) with respect to banks, only to transactions made on or before the designated transfer date, as determined under section 1062 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 [12 U.S.C. 5582], in accordance with regulations governing alternative mortgage transactions as issued by the Comptroller of the Currency for national banks, to the extent that such regulations are authorized by rulemaking authority granted to the Comptroller of the Currency with regard to national banks under laws other than this section;
<br>
<br>(2) with respect to credit unions, only to transactions made on or before the designated transfer date, as determined under section 1062 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010, in accordance with regulations governing alternative mortgage transactions as issued by the National Credit Union Administration Board for Federal credit unions, to the extent that such regulations are authorized by rulemaking authority granted to the National Credit Union Administration with regard to Federal credit unions under laws other than this section;
<br>
<br>(3) with respect to all other housing creditors, including without limitation, savings and loan associations, mutual savings banks, and savings banks, only to transactions made on or before the designated transfer date, as determined under section 1062 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010, in accordance with regulations governing alternative mortgage transactions as issued by the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision for federally chartered savings and loan associations, to the extent that such regulations are authorized by rulemaking authority granted to the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision with regard to federally chartered savings and loan associations under laws other than this section; and
<br>
<br>(4) with respect to transactions made after the designated transfer date, only in accordance with regulations governing alternative mortgage transactions, as issued by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection for federally chartered housing creditors, in accordance with the rulemaking authority granted to the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection with regard to federally chartered housing creditors under provisions of law other than this section.
<br>(b) Transactions deemed in compliance with applicable regulations
<br>
<br>For the purpose of determining the applicability of this section, an alternative mortgage transaction shall be deemed to be made in accordance with the applicable regulation notwithstanding the housing creditor's failure to comply with the regulation, if—
<br>
<br>(1) the transaction is in substantial compliance with the regulation; and
<br>
<br>(2) within sixty days of discovering any error, the housing creditor corrects such error, including making appropriate adjustments, if any, to the account.
<br>(c) Preemption of State law
<br>
<br>An alternative mortgage transaction may be made by a housing creditor in accordance with this section, notwithstanding any State constitution, law, or regulation that prohibits an alternative mortgage transaction. For purposes of this subsection, a State constitution, law, or regulation that prohibits an alternative mortgage transaction does not include any State constitution, law, or regulation that regulates mortgage transactions generally, including any restriction on prepayment penalties or late charges.
<br>(d) Bureau actions
<br>
<br>The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection shall—
<br>
<br>(1) review the regulations identified by the Comptroller of the Currency and the National Credit Union Administration,1 (as those rules exist on the designated transfer date), as applicable under paragraphs (1) through (3) of subsection (a);
<br>
<br>(2) determine whether such regulations are fair and not deceptive and otherwise meet the objectives of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010; and
<br>
<br>(3) promulgate regulations under subsection (a)(4) after the designated transfer date.
<br>(e) Designated transfer date
<br>
<br>As used in this section, the term "designated transfer date" means the date determined under section 1062 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 [12 U.S.C. 5582].

<br>Encouragement of Debt-for-Development Swaps Through Local Currency Repayment
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 101–240, title V, §531, Dec. 19, 1989, 103 Stat. 2513, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(a) Statement of Policy.—It is the sense of the Congress that—
<br>
<br>"(1) debt-for-development swaps, where payment is made in local currency at the free market rate, serve a useful purpose by providing banking institutions with constructive opportunities for the reduction of the external debt of highly indebted developing countries in a process that involves the participation of private, nonprofit groups in providing a stimulus to the economic and social development of such developing countries;
<br>
<br>"(2) debt-for-development swaps provide highly indebted developing countries with a creative method of reducing external debt burdens, while promoting their economic growth and restructuring objectives;
<br>
<br>"(3) banking institutions should give careful consideration to engaging in such swaps as one means of strengthening overall loan portfolios through the reduction of high external debt burdens while expanding economic opportunities through private sector initiatives; and
<br>
<br>"(4) in order to avoid any bias against such swaps in the regulatory framework applicable to the financial reporting of banking institutions, where payment is made in local currency at the free market rate, appropriate recognition of the fair market exchange value of the currency so received should be made.
<br>
<br>"(b) Notification Relating to Local Currency Repayment Through Debt-for-Development Swaps.—Before the end of the 6-month period beginning on the date of the enactment of this section [Dec. 19, 1989], each appropriate Federal banking agency shall adopt uniform guidelines that will effectuate the policy set forth in subsection (a) concerning the regulatory framework and accounting treatment of debt-for-development swaps involving repayment in local currency at the free market rate. For the purpose of such guidelines, the impact of such swaps on reported loan loss reserves shall be determined by valuing currency received in such swaps at fair market exchange value.
<br>
<br>"(c) Definitions.—As used in this section:
<br>
<br>"(1) Appropriate federal banking agency.—The term 'appropriate Federal banking agency' has the meaning given such term in section 903(1) of the International Lending Supervision Act of 1983 [12 U.S.C. 3902(1)].
<br>
<br>"(2) Banking institution.—The term 'banking institution' has the meaning given such term in section 903(2) of the International Lending Supervision Act of 1983.
<br>
<br>"(3) Debt-for-development swap.—The term 'debt-for-development swap' has the meaning given such term in section 1608(b)(2) of the International Financial Institutions Act [22 U.S.C. 262p–4c(b)(2)].
<br>
<br>"(4) Highly indebted country.—The term 'highly indebted country' means any country designated as a 'Highly Indebted Country' in the annual World Debt Tables most recently published by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development before the date of the enactment of this section [Dec. 19, 1989]."
<br>§3902. Definitions

<br>
<br>(a) Each appropriate Federal banking agency shall evaluate banking institution foreign country exposure and transfer risk for use in banking institution examination and supervision.

<br>§3904. Reserves

<br>
<br>(1) Each appropriate Federal banking agency shall require a banking institution to establish and maintain a special reserve whenever, in the judgment of such appropriate Federal banking agency—
<br>
<br>(A) the quality of such banking institution's assets has been impaired by a protracted inability of public or private borrowers in a foreign country to make payments on their external indebtedness as indicated by such factors, among others, as—
<br>
<br>(i) a failure by such public or private borrowers to make full interest payments on external indebtedness;
<br>
<br>(ii) a failure to comply with the terms of any restructured indebtedness; or
<br>
<br>(iii) a failure by the foreign country to comply with any International Monetary Fund or other suitable adjustment program; or
<br>
<br>(B) no definite prospects exist for the orderly restoration of debt service.
<br>
<br>(2) Such reserves shall be charged against current income and shall not be considered as part of capital and surplus or allowances for possible loan losses for regulatory, supervisory, or disclosure purposes.
<br>(b) Accommodation of potential losses on foreign loans by United States banks
<br>
<br>The appropriate Federal banking agencies shall analyze the results of foreign loan rescheduling negotiations, assess the loan loss risk reflected in rescheduling agreements, and, using the powers set forth in section 3907 of this title (regarding capital adequacy), ensure that the capital and reserve positions of United States banks are adequate to accommodate potential losses on their foreign loans.
<br>(c) Regulations and orders of Federal banking agencies
<br>
<br>The appropriate Federal banking agencies shall promulgate regulations or orders necessary to implement this section within one hundred and twenty days after November 30, 1983.

<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>Each appropriate Federal banking agency shall review the exposure to risk of United States banking institutions arising from the medium- and long-term loans made by such institutions that are outstanding to any highly indebted country. Each agency shall provide direction to such institutions regarding additions to general reserves maintained by each banking institution for potential loan losses and special reserves required by such agency arising from such review.
<br>(b) Determination of institutional exposure to risk
<br>
<br>In determining the exposure of an institution to risk for purposes of subsection (a), the appropriate Federal banking agency—
<br>
<br>(1) shall determine whether any country exposure that is, and has been for at least 2 years, rated in the category "Other Transfer Risk Problems" or the category "Substandard" by the Interagency Country Exposure Review Committee should be reevaluated;
<br>
<br>(2) may exempt, in full or in part, from reserve requirements established pursuant to subsection (a), any loan—
<br>
<br>(A) to a country that enters into a debt reduction, debt service reduction, or financing program with its bank creditors that is supported by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development or the International Monetary Fund; or
<br>
<br>(B) secured, in whole or in part, by appropriate collateral for payment of interest or principal;
<br>
<br>(3) take into account any other factors which bear on such exposure and the particular circumstances of the institution; and
<br>
<br>(4) shall consider as indicators of risk, where appropriate, the average reserve levels maintained by or required of banking institutions in foreign countries and secondary market prices for such loans.
<br>(c) Timing and report
<br>(1) Determined by agency
<br>
<br>Except as provided in paragraph (3), each appropriate Federal banking agency shall determine the timing of any addition to reserves required by subsection (a).

<br>Congressional Findings
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 101–240, title IV, §402(a), Dec. 19, 1989, 103 Stat. 2501, provided that: "The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>"(1) since the adoption of the International Lending Supervision Act of 1983 [12 U.S.C. 3901 et seq.], the credit quality of loans by United States banking institutions to highly indebted countries has deteriorated and the prospects for full repayment of such loans have diminished;
<br>
<br>"(2) in general during this period, the level of country exposure and transfer risk associated with loans by United States banking institutions to highly indebted countries has not been adequately reflected in the reserve levels established by many individual United States banking institutions or the reserve requirements imposed by Federal banking agencies pursuant to such Act;
<br>
<br>"(3) during the last 3 years and particularly in recent months, United States banking institutions have increased their reserves for possible losses from loans to highly indebted countries but such reserves remain, in some cases, significantly lower than reserves established by banking institutions in a number of foreign countries and may not be adequate to deal with potential risks; and
<br>
<br>"(4) in order to fulfill the purposes of such Act, the Federal banking agencies should take a more active role in reviewing reserve levels established by United States banking institutions for potential losses from loans to highly indebted countries and in requiring appropriate levels of both special and general reserves to reflect the increased risk of such loans."
<br>
<br>1 See References in Text note below.
<br>§3905. Accounting for fees on international loans
<br>
<br>(a)(1) In order to avoid excessive debt service burdens on debtor countries, no banking institution shall charge, in connection with the restructuring of an international loan, any fee exceeding the administrative cost of the restructuring unless it amortizes such fee over the effective life of each such loan.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) Each appropriate Federal banking agency shall promulgate such regulations as are necessary to further carry out the provisions of this subsection.
<br>
<br>(B) The requirement of paragraph (1) shall take effect on November 30, 1983.
<br>
<br>(b)(1) Subject to subsection (a), the appropriate Federal banking agencies shall promulgate regulations for accounting for agency, commitment, management and other fees charged by a banking institution in connection with an international loan.
<br>
<br>(2) Such regulations shall establish the accounting treatment of such fees for regulatory, supervisory, and disclosure purposes to assure that the appropriate portion of such fees is accrued in income over the effective life of each such loan.
<br>
<br>(3) The appropriate Federal banking agencies shall promulgate regulations or orders necessary to implement this subsection within one hundred and twenty days after November 30, 1983.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 98–181, title I [title IX, §906], Nov. 30, 1983, 97 Stat. 1279.)
<br>§3906. Collection and disclosure of international lending data
<br>(a) Submission of information to Federal banking agencies
<br>
<br>Each appropriate Federal banking agency shall require, by regulation, each banking institution with foreign country exposure to submit, no fewer than four times each calendar year, information regarding such exposure in a format prescribed by such regulations.
<br>(b) Disclosure of information to the public
<br>
<br>Each appropriate Federal banking agency shall require, by regulation, banking institutions to disclose to the public information regarding material foreign country exposure in relation to assets and to capital.
<br>(c) Regulations and orders of Federal banking agencies
<br>
<br>The appropriate Federal banking agencies shall promulgate regulations or orders necessary to implement this section within one hundred and twenty days after November 30, 1983.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 98–181, title I [title IX, §907], Nov. 30, 1983, 97 Stat. 1280.)
<br>§3907. Capital adequacy
<br>
<br>(a)(1) Each appropriate Federal banking agency shall cause banking institutions to achieve and maintain adequate capital by establishing minimum levels of capital for such banking institutions and by using such other methods as the appropriate Federal banking agency deems appropriate. Each appropriate Federal banking agency shall seek to make the capital standards required under this section or other provisions of Federal law for insured depository institutions countercyclical so that the amount of capital required to be maintained by an insured depository institution increases in times of economic expansion and decreases in times of economic contraction, consistent with the safety and soundness of the insured depository institution.
<br>
<br>(2) Each appropriate Federal banking agency shall have the authority to establish such minimum level of capital for a banking institution as the appropriate Federal banking agency, in its discretion, deems to be necessary or appropriate in light of the particular circumstances of the banking institution.
<br>
<br>(b)(1) Failure of a banking institution to maintain capital at or above its minimum level as established pursuant to subsection (a) may be deemed by the appropriate Federal banking agency, in its discretion, to constitute an unsafe and unsound practice within the meaning of section 1818 of this title.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) In addition to, or in lieu of, any other action authorized by law, including paragraph (1), the appropriate Federal banking agency may issue a directive to a banking institution that fails to maintain captial 1 at or above its required level as established pursuant to subsection (a).
<br>
<br>(B)(i) Such directive may require the banking institution to submit and adhere to a plan acceptable to the appropriate Federal banking agency describing the means and timing by which the banking institution shall achieve its required capital level.
<br>
<br>(ii) Any such directive issued pursuant to this paragraph, including plans submitted pursuant thereto, shall be enforceable under the provisions of section 1818(i) of this title to the same extent as an effective and outstanding order issued pursuant to section 1818(b) of this title which has become final.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) Each appropriate Federal banking agency may consider such banking institution's progress in adhering to any plan required under this subsection whenever such banking institution, or an affiliate thereof, or the holding company which controls such banking institution, seeks the requisite approval of such appropriate Federal banking agency for any proposal which would divert earnings, diminish capital, or otherwise impede such banking institution's progress in achieving its minimum capital level.
<br>
<br>(B) Such appropriate Federal banking agency may deny such approval where it determines that such proposal would adversely affect the ability of the banking institution to comply with such plan.
<br>
<br>(C) The Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Secretary of the Treasury shall encourage governments, central banks, and regulatory authorities of other major banking countries to work toward maintaining and, where appropriate, strengthening the capital bases of banking institutions involved in international lending.

<br>§3908. Foreign loan evaluations
<br>(a) Projects requiring an economic feasibility evaluation; content of evaluation
<br>
<br>(1) In any case in which one or more banking institutions extend credit, whether by loan, lease, guarantee, or otherwise, which individually or in the aggregate exceeds $20,000,000, to finance any project which has as a major objective the construction or operation of any mining operation, any metal or mineral primary processing operation, any fabricating facility or operation, or any metal-making operations (semi and finished) located outside the United States or its territories and possessions, a written economic feasibility evaluation of such foreign project shall be prepared and approved in writing by a senior official of the banking institution, or, if more than one banking institution is involved, the lead banking institution, prior to the extension of such credit.
<br>
<br>(2) Such evaluation shall—
<br>
<br>(A) take into account the profit potential of the project, the impact of the project on world markets, the inherent competitive advantages and disadvantages of the project over the entire life of the project, and the likely effect of the project upon the overall long-term economic development of the country in which the project is located; and
<br>
<br>(B) consider whether the extension of credit can reasonably be expected to be repaid from revenues generated by such foreign project without regard to any subsidy, as defined in international agreements, provided by the government involved or any instrumentality of any country.
<br>(b) Review of evaluation by Federal banking agencies
<br>
<br>Such economic feasibility evaluations shall be reviewed by representatives of the appropriate Federal banking agencies whenever an examination by such appropriate Federal banking agency is conducted.
<br>(c) Other statutory authorities applicable
<br>
<br>(1) The authorities of the Federal banking agencies contained in section 1818 of this title and in section 3909 of this title, except those contained in section 3909(d) of this title, shall be applicable to this section.

<br>(b) Systems uniformity
<br>
<br>The appropriate Federal banking agencies shall establish uniform systems to implement the authorities provided under this chapter.
<br>(c) Existing authorities
