<br>
<br>(A) for seizure of an imminently hazardous chemical substance or mixture or any article containing such a substance or mixture,
<br>
<br>(B) for relief (as authorized by subsection (b)) against any person who manufactures, processes, distributes in commerce, or uses, or disposes of, an imminently hazardous chemical substance or mixture or any article containing such a substance or mixture, or
<br>
<br>(C) for both such seizure and relief.
<br>
<br>A civil action may be commenced under this paragraph notwithstanding the existence of a determination under section 2604 or 2605 of this title, a rule under section 2603, 2604, or 2605 of this title or subchapter IV, an order under section 2603, 2604, or 2605 of this title or subchapter IV, or a consent agreement under section 2603 of this title, and notwithstanding the pendency of any administrative or judicial proceeding under any provision of this chapter.
<br>
<br>(2) If the Administrator has not made a rule under section 2605(a) of this title immediately effective (as authorized by section 2605(d)(3)(A)(i) of this title) with respect to an imminently hazardous chemical substance or mixture, the Administrator shall commence in a district court of the United States with respect to such substance or mixture or article containing such substance or mixture a civil action described in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of paragraph (1).
<br>(b) Relief authorized
<br>
<br>(1) The district court of the United States in which an action under subsection (a) is brought shall have jurisdiction to grant such temporary or permanent relief as may be necessary to protect health or the environment from the unreasonable risk (as identified by the Administrator without consideration of costs or other nonrisk factors) associated with the chemical substance, mixture, or article involved in such action.
<br>
<br>(2) In the case of an action under subsection (a) brought against a person who manufactures, processes, or distributes in commerce a chemical substance or mixture or an article containing a chemical substance or mixture, the relief authorized by paragraph (1) may include the issuance of a mandatory order requiring (A) in the case of purchasers of such substance, mixture, or article known to the defendant, notification to such purchasers of the risk associated with it; (B) public notice of such risk; (C) recall; (D) the replacement or repurchase of such substance, mixture, or article; or (E) any combination of the actions described in the preceding clauses.
<br>
<br>(3) In the case of an action under subsection (a) against a chemical substance, mixture, or article, such substance, mixture, or article may be proceeded against by process of libel for its seizure and condemnation. Proceedings in such an action shall conform as nearly as possible to proceedings in rem in admiralty.
<br>(c) Venue and consolidation
<br>
<br>(1)(A) An action under subsection (a) against a person who manufactures, processes, or distributes a chemical substance or mixture or an article containing a chemical substance or mixture may be brought in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or for any judicial district in which any of the defendants is found, resides, or transacts business; and process in such an action may be served on a defendant in any other district in which such defendant resides or may be found. An action under subsection (a) against a chemical substance, mixture, or article may be brought in any United States district court within the jurisdiction of which the substance, mixture, or article is found.
<br>
<br>(B) In determining the judicial district in which an action may be brought under subsection (a) in instances in which such action may be brought in more than one judicial district, the Administrator shall take into account the convenience of the parties.
<br>
<br>(C) Subpeonas 1 requiring attendance of witnesses in an action brought under subsection (a) may be served in any judicial district.
<br>
<br>(2) Whenever proceedings under subsection (a) involving identical chemical substances, mixtures, or articles are pending in courts in two or more judicial districts, they shall be consolidated for trial by order of any such court upon application reasonably made by any party in interest, upon notice to all parties in interest.
<br>(d) Action under section 2605
<br>
<br>Where appropriate, concurrently with the filing of an action under subsection (a) or as soon thereafter as may be practicable, the Administrator shall initiate a proceeding for the promulgation of a rule under section 2605(a) of this title.
<br>(e) Representation
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in any action under subsection (a), the Administrator may direct attorneys of the Environmental Protection Agency to appear and represent the Administrator in such an action.
<br>(f) "Imminently hazardous chemical substance or mixture" defined
<br>
<br>For the purposes of subsection (a), the term "imminently hazardous chemical substance or mixture" means a chemical substance or mixture which presents an imminent and unreasonable risk of serious or widespread injury to health or the environment, without consideration of costs or other nonrisk factors. Such a risk to health or the environment shall be considered imminent if it is shown that the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of the chemical substance or mixture, or that any combination of such activities, is likely to result in such injury to health or the environment before a final rule under section 2605 of this title can protect against such risk.

<br>§2608. Relationship to other Federal laws
<br>(a) Laws not administered by the Administrator
<br>
<br>(1) If the Administrator determines that the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of a chemical substance or mixture, or that any combination of such activities, presents an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, without consideration of costs or other nonrisk factors, including an unreasonable risk to a potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulation identified as relevant by the Administrator, under the conditions of use, and determines, in the Administrator's discretion, that such risk may be prevented or reduced to a sufficient extent by action taken under a Federal law not administered by the Administrator, the Administrator shall submit to the agency which administers such law a report which describes such risk and includes in such description a specification of the activity or combination of activities which the Administrator has reason to believe so presents such risk. Such report shall also request such agency—
<br>
<br>(A)(i) to determine if the risk described in such report may be prevented or reduced to a sufficient extent by action taken under such law, and
<br>
<br>(ii) if the agency determines that such risk may be so prevented or reduced, to issue an order declaring whether or not the activity or combination of activities specified in the description of such risk presents such risk; and
<br>
<br>(B) to respond to the Administrator with respect to the matters described in subparagraph (A).
<br>
<br>Any report of the Administrator shall include a detailed statement of the information on which it is based and shall be published in the Federal Register. The agency receiving a request under such a report shall make the requested determination, issue the requested order, and make the requested response within such time as the Administrator specifies in the request, but such time specified may not be less than 90 days from the date the request was made. The response of an agency shall be accompanied by a detailed statement of the findings and conclusions of the agency and shall be published in the Federal Register.
<br>
<br>(2) If the Administrator makes a report under paragraph (1) with respect to a chemical substance or mixture and the agency to which such report was made either—
<br>
<br>(A) issues an order, within the time period specified by the Administrator in the report, declaring that the activity or combination of activities specified in the description of the risk described in the report does not present the risk described in the report, or
<br>
<br>(B) responds within the time period specified by the Administrator in the report and initiates, within 90 days of the publication in the Federal Register of the response of the agency under paragraph (1), action under the law (or laws) administered by such agency to protect against such risk associated with such activity or combination of activities,
<br>
<br>the Administrator may not take any action under section 2605(a) or 2606 of this title with respect to such risk.
<br>
<br>(3) The Administrator shall take the actions described in paragraph (4) if the Administrator makes a report under paragraph (1) with respect to a chemical substance or mixture and the agency to which the report was made does not—
<br>
<br>(A) issue the order described in paragraph (2)(A) within the time period specified by the Administrator in the report; or
<br>
<br>(B)(i) respond under paragraph (1) within the timeframe specified by the Administrator in the report; and
<br>
<br>(ii) initiate action within 90 days of publication in the Federal Register of the response described in clause (i).
<br>
<br>(4) If an agency to which a report is submitted under paragraph (1) does not take the actions described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (3), the Administrator shall—
<br>
<br>(A) initiate or complete appropriate action under section 2605(a) of this title; or
<br>
<br>(B) take any action authorized or required under section 2606 of this title, as applicable.
<br>
<br>(5) This subsection shall not relieve the Administrator of any obligation to take any appropriate action under section 2605(a) or 2606 of this title to address risks from the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of a chemical substance or mixture, or any combination of those activities, that are not identified in a report issued by the Administrator under paragraph (1).
<br>
<br>(6) If the Administrator has initiated action under section 2605(a) or 2606 of this title with respect to a risk associated with a chemical substance or mixture which was the subject of a report made to an agency under paragraph (1), such agency shall before taking action under the law (or laws) administered by it to protect against such risk consult with the Administrator for the purpose of avoiding duplication of Federal action against such risk.
<br>(b) Laws administered by the Administrator
<br>
<br>(1) The Administrator shall coordinate actions taken under this chapter with actions taken under other Federal laws administered in whole or in part by the Administrator. If the Administrator determines that a risk to health or the environment associated with a chemical substance or mixture could be eliminated or reduced to a sufficient extent by actions taken under the authorities contained in such other Federal laws, the Administrator shall use such authorities to protect against such risk unless the Administrator determines, in the Administrator's discretion, that it is in the public interest to protect against such risk by actions taken under this chapter. This subsection shall not be construed to relieve the Administrator of any requirement imposed on the Administrator by such other Federal laws.
<br>
<br>(2) In making a determination under paragraph (1) that it is in the public interest for the Administrator to take an action under this subchapter with respect to a chemical substance or mixture rather than under another law administered in whole or in part by the Administrator, the Administrator shall consider, based on information reasonably available to the Administrator, all relevant aspects of the risk described in paragraph (1) and a comparison of the estimated costs and efficiencies of the action to be taken under this subchapter and an action to be taken under such other law to protect against such risk.
<br>(c) Occupational safety and health
<br>
<br>In exercising any authority under this chapter, the Administrator shall not, for purposes of section 653(b)(1) of title 29, be deemed to be exercising statutory authority to prescribe or enforce standards or regulations affecting occupational safety and health.
<br>(d) Coordination
<br>
<br>In administering this chapter, the Administrator shall consult and coordinate with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the heads of any other appropriate Federal executive department or agency, any relevant independent regulatory agency, and any other appropriate instrumentality of the Federal Government for the purpose of achieving the maximum enforcement of this chapter while imposing the least burdens of duplicative requirements on those subject to the chapter and for other purposes. The Administrator shall, in the report required by section 2629 of this title, report annually to the Congress on actions taken to coordinate with such other Federal departments, agencies, or instrumentalities, and on actions taken to coordinate the authority under this chapter with the authority granted under other Acts referred to in subsection (b).
<br>(e) Exposure information
<br>
<br>In addition to the requirements of subsection (a), if the Administrator obtains information related to exposures or releases of a chemical substance or mixture that may be prevented or reduced under another Federal law, including a law not administered by the Administrator, the Administrator shall make such information available to the relevant Federal agency or office of the Environmental Protection Agency.

Such an inspection may only be made upon the presentation of appropriate credentials and of a written notice to the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the premises or conveyance to be inspected. A separate notice shall be given for each such inspection, but a notice shall not be required for each entry made during the period covered by the inspection. Each such inspection shall be commenced and completed with reasonable promptness and shall be conducted at reasonable times, within reasonable limits, and in a reasonable manner.
<br>(b) Scope
<br>
<br>(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), an inspection conducted under subsection (a) shall extend to all things within the premises or conveyance inspected (including records, files, papers, processes, controls, and facilities) bearing on whether the requirements of this chapter applicable to the chemical substances, mixtures, or products subject to subchapter IV within such premises or conveyance have been complied with.
<br>
<br>(2) No inspection under subsection (a) shall extend to—
<br>
<br>(A) financial information,

<br>(ii) the purposes for which each of these compounds are used domestically, the amount of these compounds currently consumed annually for each purpose, and the estimated amounts to be consumed for each purpose in 2010 and beyond;
<br>
<br>(iii) the sources and amounts of each mercury compound exported from the United States annually in each of the last three years;
<br>
<br>(iv) the potential for these compounds to be processed into elemental mercury after export from the United States; and
<br>
<br>(v) other relevant information that Congress should consider in determining whether to extend the export prohibition to include one or more of these mercury compounds.
<br>(B) Procedure
<br>
<br>For the purpose of preparing the report under this paragraph, the Administrator may utilize the information gathering authorities of this subchapter, including sections 2609 and 2610 of this title.
<br>(4) Essential use exemption
<br>
<br>(A) Any person residing in the United States may petition the Administrator for an exemption from the prohibition in paragraph (1), and the Administrator may grant by rule, after notice and opportunity for comment, an exemption for a specified use at an identified foreign facility if the Administrator finds that—
<br>
<br>(i) nonmercury alternatives for the specified use are not available in the country where the facility is located;
<br>
<br>(ii) there is no other source of elemental mercury available from domestic supplies (not including new mercury mines) in the country where the elemental mercury will be used;
<br>
<br>(iii) the country where the elemental mercury will be used certifies its support for the exemption;
<br>
<br>(iv) the export will be conducted in such a manner as to ensure the elemental mercury will be used at the identified facility as described in the petition, and not otherwise diverted for other uses for any reason;
<br>
<br>(v) the elemental mercury will be used in a manner that will protect human health and the environment, taking into account local, regional, and global human health and environmental impacts;
<br>
<br>(vi) the elemental mercury will be handled and managed in a manner that will protect human health and the environment, taking into account local, regional, and global human health and environmental impacts; and
<br>
<br>(vii) the export of elemental mercury for the specified use is consistent with international obligations of the United States intended to reduce global mercury supply, use, and pollution.
<br>
<br>(B) Each exemption issued by the Administrator pursuant to this paragraph shall contain such terms and conditions as are necessary to minimize the export of elemental mercury and ensure that the conditions for granting the exemption will be fully met, and shall contain such other terms and conditions as the Administrator may prescribe. No exemption granted pursuant to this paragraph shall exceed three years in duration and no such exemption shall exceed 10 metric tons of elemental mercury.
<br>
<br>(C) The Administrator may by order suspend or cancel an exemption under this paragraph in the case of a violation described in subparagraph (D).
<br>

<br>Findings
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 110–414, §2, Oct. 14, 2008, 122 Stat. 4341, provided that: "Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>"(1) mercury is highly toxic to humans, ecosystems, and wildlife;
<br>
<br>"(2) as many as 10 percent of women in the United States of childbearing age have mercury in the blood at a level that could put a baby at risk;
<br>
<br>"(3) as many as 630,000 children born annually in the United States are at risk of neurological problems related to mercury;
<br>
<br>"(4) the most significant source of mercury exposure to people in the United States is ingestion of mercury-contaminated fish;
<br>
<br>"(5) the Environmental Protection Agency reports that, as of 2004—
<br>
<br>"(A) 44 States have fish advisories covering over 13,000,000 lake acres and over 750,000 river miles;
<br>
<br>"(B) in 21 States the freshwater advisories are statewide; and
<br>
<br>"(C) in 12 States the coastal advisories are statewide;
<br>
<br>"(6) the long-term solution to mercury pollution is to minimize global mercury use and releases to eventually achieve reduced contamination levels in the environment, rather than reducing fish consumption since uncontaminated fish represents a critical and healthy source of nutrition worldwide;
<br>
<br>"(7) mercury pollution is a transboundary pollutant, depositing locally, regionally, and globally, and affecting water bodies near industrial sources (including the Great Lakes) and remote areas (including the Arctic Circle);
<br>
<br>"(8) the free trade of elemental mercury on the world market, at relatively low prices and in ready supply, encourages the continued use of elemental mercury outside of the United States, often involving highly dispersive activities such as artisinal [probably should be "artisanal"] gold mining;
<br>
<br>"(9) the intentional use of mercury is declining in the United States as a consequence of process changes to manufactured products (including batteries, paints, switches, and measuring devices), but those uses remain substantial in the developing world where releases from the products are extremely likely due to the limited pollution control and waste management infrastructures in those countries;
<br>
<br>"(10) the member countries of the European Union collectively are the largest source of elemental mercury exports globally;
<br>
<br>"(11) the European Commission has proposed to the European Parliament and to the Council of the European Union a regulation to ban exports of elemental mercury from the European Union by 2011;
<br>
<br>"(12) the United States is a net exporter of elemental mercury and, according to the United States Geological Survey, exported 506 metric tons of elemental mercury more than the United States imported during the period of 2000 through 2004; and
<br>
<br>"(13) banning exports of elemental mercury from the United States will have a notable effect on the market availability of elemental mercury and switching to affordable mercury alternatives in the developing world."
<br>§2612. Entry into customs territory of the United States
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>(1) The Secretary of the Treasury shall refuse entry into the customs territory of the United States (as defined in general note 2 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States) of any chemical substance, mixture, or article containing a chemical substance or mixture offered for such entry if—
<br>
<br>(A) it fails to comply with any rule in effect under this chapter, or
<br>
<br>(B) it is offered for entry in violation of section 2604 of this title, 2605 of this title, or subchapter IV, a rule or order under section 2604 of this title, 2605 of this title, or subchapter IV, or an order issued in a civil action brought under section 2604 of this title, 2606 of this title or subchapter IV.
<br>
<br>(2) If a chemical substance, mixture, or article is refused entry under paragraph (1), the Secretary of the Treasury shall notify the consignee of such entry refusal, shall not release it to the consignee, and shall cause its disposal or storage (under such rules as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe) if it has not been exported by the consignee within 90 days from the date of receipt of notice of such refusal, except that the Secretary of the Treasury may, pending a review by the Administrator of the entry refusal, release to the consignee such substance, mixture, or article on execution of bond for the amount of the full invoice of such substance, mixture, or article (as such value is set forth in the customs entry), together with the duty thereon. On failure to return such substance, mixture, or article for any cause to the custody of the Secretary of the Treasury when demanded, such consignee shall be liable to the United States for liquidated damages equal to the full amount of such bond. All charges for storage, cartage, and labor on and for disposal of substances, mixtures, or articles which are refused entry or release under this section shall be paid by the owner or consignee, and in default of such payment shall constitute a lien against any future entry made by such owner or consignee.
<br>(b) Rules
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the Administrator, shall issue rules for the administration of subsection (a) of this section.
