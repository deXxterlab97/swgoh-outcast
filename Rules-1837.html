<br>
<br>"(1) There are opportunities for greater sharing of the health-care resources of the Veterans' Administration and the Department of Defense which would, if achieved, be beneficial to both veterans and members of the Armed Forces and could result in reduced costs to the Government by minimizing duplication and underuse of health-care resources.

<br>"(2) Present incentives to encourage such sharing of health-care resources are inadequate.
