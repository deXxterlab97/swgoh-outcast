<br>(D) 6-month determinations
<br>
<br>If a group health plan (or a health insurance issuer offering coverage in connection with a group health plan) seeks an exemption under this paragraph, determinations under subparagraph (A) shall be made after such plan (or coverage) has complied with this section for the first 6 months of the plan year involved.
<br>(E) Notification

<br>
<br>A group health plan (or a health insurance issuer offering coverage in connection with a group health plan) that, based upon a certification described under subparagraph (C), qualifies for an exemption under this paragraph, and elects to implement the exemption, shall promptly notify the Secretary, the appropriate State agencies, and participants and beneficiaries in the plan of such election.

<br>To determine compliance with this paragraph, the Secretary may audit the books and records of a group health plan or health insurance issuer relating to an exemption, including any actuarial reports prepared pursuant to subparagraph (C), during the 6 year period following the notification of such exemption under subparagraph (E). A State agency receiving a notification under subparagraph (E) may also conduct such an audit with respect to an exemption covered by such notification.
<br>(d) Separate application to each option offered
<br>
<br>In the case of a group health plan that offers a participant or beneficiary two or more benefit package options under the plan, the requirements of this section shall be applied separately with respect to each such option.

<br>§1185e. Preventing surprise medical bills
<br>(a) Coverage of emergency services
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>If a group health plan, or a health insurance issuer offering group health insurance coverage, provides or covers any benefits with respect to services in an emergency department of a hospital or with respect to emergency services in an independent freestanding emergency department (as defined in paragraph (3)(D)), the plan or issuer shall cover emergency services (as defined in paragraph (3)(C))—
<br>
<br>(A) without the need for any prior authorization determination;
<br>
<br>(B) whether the health care provider furnishing such services is a participating provider or a participating emergency facility, as applicable, with respect to such services;
<br>
<br>(C) in a manner so that, if such services are provided to a participant or beneficiary by a nonparticipating provider or a nonparticipating emergency facility—
<br>
<br>(i) such services will be provided without imposing any requirement under the plan for prior authorization of services or any limitation on coverage that is more restrictive than the requirements or limitations that apply to emergency services received from participating providers and participating emergency facilities with respect to such plan or coverage, respectively;
<br>
<br>(ii) the cost-sharing requirement is not greater than the requirement that would apply if such services were provided by a participating provider or a participating emergency facility;
<br>
<br>(iii) such cost-sharing requirement is calculated as if the total amount that would have been charged for such services by such participating provider or participating emergency facility were equal to the recognized amount (as defined in paragraph (3)(H)) for such services, plan or coverage, and year;
<br>
<br>(iv) the group health plan or health insurance issuer, respectively—
<br>
<br>(I) not later than 30 calendar days after the bill for such services is transmitted by such provider or facility, sends to the provider or facility, as applicable, an initial payment or notice of denial of payment; and
<br>
<br>(II) pays a total plan or coverage payment directly to such provider or facility, respectively (in accordance, if applicable, with the timing requirement described in subsection (c)(6)) that is, with application of any initial payment under subclause (I), equal to the amount by which the out-of-network rate (as defined in paragraph (3)(K)) for such services exceeds the cost-sharing amount for such services (as determined in accordance with clauses (ii) and (iii)) and year; and
<br>
<br>(v) any cost-sharing payments made by the participant or beneficiary with respect to such emergency services so furnished shall be counted toward any in-network deductible or out-of-pocket maximums applied under the plan or coverage, respectively (and such in-network deductible and out-of-pocket maximums shall be applied) in the same manner as if such cost-sharing payments were made with respect to emergency services furnished by a participating provider or a participating emergency facility; and
<br>
<br>(D) without regard to any other term or condition of such coverage (other than exclusion or coordination of benefits, or an affiliation or waiting period, permitted under section 300gg–3 of title 42, including as incorporated pursuant to section 1185d of this title and section 9815 of title 26, and other than applicable cost-sharing).
<br>(2) Regulations for qualifying payment amounts
<br>
<br>Not later than July 1, 2021, the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall establish through rulemaking—
<br>
<br>(A) the methodology the group health plan or health insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage in the group market shall use to determine the qualifying payment amount, differentiating by large group market, and small group market;
<br>
<br>(B) the information such plan or issuer, respectively, shall share with the nonparticipating provider or nonparticipating facility, as applicable, when making such a determination;
<br>
<br>(C) the geographic regions applied for purposes of this subparagraph, taking into account access to items and services in rural and underserved areas, including health professional shortage areas, as defined in section 254e of title 42; and
<br>
<br>(D) a process to receive complaints of violations of the requirements described in subclauses (I) and (II) of subparagraph (A)(i) by group health plans and health insurance issuers offering health insurance coverage in the group market.
<br>
<br>Such rulemaking shall take into account payments that are made by such plan or issuer, respectively, that are not on a fee-for-service basis. Such methodology may account for relevant payment adjustments that take into account quality or facility type (including higher acuity settings and the case-mix of various facility types) that are otherwise taken into account for purposes of determining payment amounts with respect to participating facilities. In carrying out clause (iii), the Secretary shall consult with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to establish the geographic regions under such clause and shall periodically update such regions, as appropriate, taking into account the findings of the report submitted under section 109(a) of the No Surprises Act.

<br>(c) Determination of out-of-network rates to be paid by health plans; independent dispute resolution process
<br>(1) Determination through open negotiation
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>With respect to an item or service furnished in a year by a nonparticipating provider or a nonparticipating facility, with respect to a group health plan or health insurance issuer offering group health insurance coverage, in a State described in subsection (a)(3)(K)(ii) with respect to such plan or coverage and provider or facility, and for which a payment is required to be made by the plan or coverage pursuant to subsection (a)(1) or (b)(1), the provider or facility (as applicable) or plan or coverage may, during the 30-day period beginning on the day the provider or facility receives an initial payment or a notice of denial of payment from the plan or coverage regarding a claim for payment for such item or service, initiate open negotiations under this paragraph between such provider or facility and plan or coverage for purposes of determining, during the open negotiation period, an amount agreed on by such provider or facility, respectively, and such plan or coverage for payment (including any cost-sharing) for such item or service. For purposes of this subsection, the open negotiation period, with respect to an item or service, is the 30-day period beginning on the date of initiation of the negotiations with respect to such item or service.
<br>(B) Accessing independent dispute resolution process in case of failed negotiations
<br>
<br>In the case of open negotiations pursuant to subparagraph (A), with respect to an item or service, that do not result in a determination of an amount of payment for such item or service by the last day of the open negotiation period described in such subparagraph with respect to such item or service, the provider or facility (as applicable) or group health plan or health insurance issuer offering group health insurance coverage that was party to such negotiations may, during the 4-day period beginning on the day after such open negotiation period, initiate the independent dispute resolution process under paragraph (2) with respect to such item or service.

<br>Not later than 1 year after December 27, 2020, the Secretary, jointly with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of the Treasury, shall establish by regulation one independent dispute resolution process (referred to in this subsection as the "IDR process") under which, in the case of an item or service with respect to which a provider or facility (as applicable) or group health plan or health insurance issuer offering group health insurance coverage submits a notification under paragraph (1)(B) (in this subsection referred to as a "qualified IDR item or service"), a certified IDR entity under paragraph (4) determines, subject to subparagraph (B) and in accordance with the succeeding provisions of this subsection, the amount of payment under the plan or coverage for such item or service furnished by such provider or facility.
<br>(B) Authority to continue negotiations
<br>
<br>Under the independent dispute resolution process, in the case that the parties to a determination for a qualified IDR item or service agree on a payment amount for such item or service during such process but before the date on which the entity selected with respect to such determination under paragraph (4) makes such determination under paragraph (5), such amount shall be treated for purposes of subsection (a)(3)(K)(ii) as the amount agreed to by such parties for such item or service. In the case of an agreement described in the previous sentence, the independent dispute resolution process shall provide for a method to determine how to allocate between the parties to such determination the payment of the compensation of the entity selected with respect to such determination.
<br>(C) Clarification
<br>
<br>A nonparticipating provider may not, with respect to an item or service furnished by such provider, submit a notification under paragraph (1)(B) if such provider is exempt from the requirement under subsection (a) of section 300gg–132 of title 42 with respect to such item or service pursuant to subsection (b) of such section.
<br>(3) Treatment of batching of items and services
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Under the IDR process, the Secretary shall specify criteria under which multiple qualified IDR dispute items and services are permitted to be considered jointly as part of a single determination by an entity for purposes of encouraging the efficiency (including minimizing costs) of the IDR process. Such items and services may be so considered only if—
<br>
<br>(i) such items and services to be included in such determination are furnished by the same provider or facility;
<br>
<br>(ii) payment for such items and services is required to be made by the same group health plan or health insurance issuer;
<br>
<br>(iii) such items and services are related to the treatment of a similar condition; and
<br>
<br>(iv) such items and services were furnished during the 30 day 2 period following the date on which the first item or service included with respect to such determination was furnished or an alternative period as determined by the Secretary, for use in limited situations, such as by the consent of the parties or in the case of low-volume items and services, to encourage procedural efficiency and minimize health plan and provider administrative costs.
<br>(B) Treatment of bundled payments
<br>
<br>In carrying out subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall provide that, in the case of items and services which are included by a provider or facility as part of a bundled payment, such items and services included in such bundled payment may be part of a single determination under this subsection.
<br>(4) Certification and selection of IDR entities
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary, jointly with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and Secretary of the Treasury, shall establish a process to certify (including to recertify) entities under this paragraph. Such process shall ensure that an entity so certified—
<br>
<br>(i) has (directly or through contracts or other arrangements) sufficient medical, legal, and other expertise and sufficient staffing to make determinations described in paragraph (5) on a timely basis;
<br>
<br>(ii) is not—
<br>
<br>(I) a group health plan or health insurance issuer offering group health insurance coverage, provider, or facility;
<br>
<br>(II) an affiliate or a subsidiary of such a group health plan or health insurance issuer, provider, or facility; or

<br>
<br>(vii) meets such other requirements as determined appropriate by the Secretary.
<br>(B) Period of certification
<br>
<br>Subject to subparagraph (C), each certification (including a recertification) of an entity under the process described in subparagraph (A) shall be for a 5-year period.
<br>(C) Revocation
<br>
<br>A certification of an entity under this paragraph may be revoked under the process described in subparagraph (A) if the entity has a pattern or practice of noncompliance with any of the requirements described in such subparagraph.
<br>(D) Petition for denial or withdrawal
<br>
<br>The process described in subparagraph (A) shall ensure that an individual, provider, facility, or group health plan or health insurance issuer offering group health insurance coverage may petition for a denial of a certification or a revocation of a certification with respect to an entity under this paragraph for failure of meeting a requirement of this subsection.
<br>(E) Sufficient number of entities
<br>
<br>The process described in subparagraph (A) shall ensure that a sufficient number of entities are certified under this paragraph to ensure the timely and efficient provision of determinations described in paragraph (5).
<br>(F) Selection of certified IDR entity

<br>
<br>(I) is not a party to such determination or an employee or agent of such a party;
<br>
<br>(II) does not have a material familial, financial, or professional relationship with such a party; and
<br>
<br>(III) does not otherwise have a conflict of interest with such a party (as determined by the Secretary); and
<br>
<br>(ii) that requires, in the case such parties do not make such selection by such last day, the Secretary to, not later than 6 business days after such date of initiation—
<br>
<br>(I) select such an entity that satisfies subclauses (I) through (III) of clause (i)); and

<br>(I) an offer for a payment amount for such item or service furnished by such provider or facility; and
<br>
<br>(II) such information as requested by the certified IDR entity relating to such offer; and
<br>

<br>
<br>(II) subject to subparagraph (D), information on any circumstance described in clause (ii), such information as requested in subparagraph (B)(i)(II), and any additional information provided in subparagraph (B)(ii).
<br>(ii) Additional circumstances

<br>(I) The level of training, experience, and quality and outcomes measurements of the provider or facility that furnished such item or service (such as those endorsed by the consensus-based entity authorized in section 1890 of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1395aaa]).
<br>
<br>(II) The market share held by the nonparticipating provider or facility or that of the plan or issuer in the geographic region in which the item or service was provided.
<br>
<br>(III) The acuity of the individual receiving such item or service or the complexity of furnishing such item or service to such individual.

<br>(V) Demonstrations of good faith efforts (or lack of good faith efforts) made by the nonparticipating provider or nonparticipating facility or the plan or issuer to enter into network agreements and, if applicable, contracted rates between the provider or facility, as applicable, and the plan or issuer, as applicable, during the previous 4 plan years.
<br>(D) Prohibition on consideration of certain factors
<br>
<br>In determining which offer is the payment to be applied with respect to qualified IDR items and services furnished by a provider or facility, the certified IDR entity with respect to a determination shall not consider usual and customary charges, the amount that would have been billed by such provider or facility with respect to such items and services had the provisions of section 300gg–131 of title 42 or section 300gg–132 of such title (as applicable) not applied, or the payment or reimbursement rate for such items and services furnished by such provider or facility payable by a public payor, including under the Medicare program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.], under the Medicaid program under title XIX of such Act [42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.], under the Children's Health Insurance Program under title XXI of such Act [42 U.S.C. 1397aa et seq.], under the TRICARE program under chapter 55 of title 10, or under chapter 17 of title 38.

<br>(iii) Subsequent submission of requests permitted
<br>
<br>In the case of a notification that pursuant to clause (ii) is not permitted to be submitted under paragraph (1)(B) during a 90-day period specified in such clause, if the end of the open negotiation period specified in paragraph (1)(A), that but for this clause would otherwise apply with respect to such notification, occurs during such 90-day period, such paragraph (1)(B) shall be applied as if the reference in such paragraph to the 4-day period beginning on the day after such open negotiation period were instead a reference to the 30-day period beginning on the day after the last day of such 90-day period.

<br>§1185f. Ending surprise air ambulance bills
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>In the case of a participant or beneficiary who is in a group health plan or group health insurance coverage offered by a health insurance issuer and who receives air ambulance services from a nonparticipating provider (as defined in section 1185e(a)(3)(G) of this title) with respect to such plan or coverage, if such services would be covered if provided by a participating provider (as defined in such section) with respect to such plan or coverage—
<br>
<br>(1) the cost-sharing requirement with respect to such services shall be the same requirement that would apply if such services were provided by such a participating provider, and any coinsurance or deductible shall be based on rates that would apply for such services if they were furnished by such a participating provider;
<br>
<br>(2) such cost-sharing amounts shall be counted towards the in-network deductible and in-network out-of-pocket maximum amount under the plan or coverage for the plan year (and such in-network deductible shall be applied) with respect to such items and services so furnished in the same manner as if such cost-sharing payments were with respect to items and services furnished by a participating provider; and
<br>
<br>(3) the group health plan or health insurance issuer, respectively, shall—
<br>
<br>(A) not later than 30 calendar days after the bill for such services is transmitted by such provider, send to the provider, an initial payment or notice of denial of payment; and
<br>
<br>(B) pay a total plan or coverage payment, in accordance with, if applicable, subsection (b)(6), directly to such provider furnishing such services to such participant, beneficiary, or enrollee that is, with application of any initial payment under subparagraph (A), equal to the amount by which the out-of-network rate (as defined in section 1185e(a)(3)(K) of this title) for such services and year involved exceeds the cost-sharing amount imposed under the plan or coverage, respectively, for such services (as determined in accordance with paragraphs (1) and (2)).
<br>(b) Determination of out-of-network rates to be paid by health plans; independent dispute resolution process
<br>(1) Determination through open negotiation
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>With respect to air ambulance services furnished in a year by a nonparticipating provider, with respect to a group health plan or health insurance issuer offering group health insurance coverage, and for which a payment is required to be made by the plan or coverage pursuant to subsection (a)(3), the provider or plan or coverage may, during the 30-day period beginning on the day the provider receives a payment or a statement of denial of payment from the plan or coverage regarding a claim for payment for such service, initiate open negotiations under this paragraph between such provider and plan or coverage for purposes of determining, during the open negotiation period, an amount agreed on by such provider, and such plan or coverage for payment (including any cost-sharing) for such service. For purposes of this subsection, the open negotiation period, with respect to air ambulance services, is the 30-day period beginning on the date of initiation of the negotiations with respect to such services.
<br>(B) Accessing independent dispute resolution process in case of failed negotiations
<br>
<br>In the case of open negotiations pursuant to subparagraph (A), with respect to air ambulance services, that do not result in a determination of an amount of payment for such services by the last day of the open negotiation period described in such subparagraph with respect to such services, the provider or group health plan or health insurance issuer offering group health insurance coverage that was party to such negotiations may, during the 4-day period beginning on the day after such open negotiation period, initiate the independent dispute resolution process under paragraph (2) with respect to such item or service. The independent dispute resolution process shall be initiated by a party pursuant to the previous sentence by submission to the other party and to the Secretary of a notification (containing such information as specified by the Secretary) and for purposes of this subsection, the date of initiation of such process shall be the date of such submission or such other date specified by the Secretary pursuant to regulations that is not later than the date of receipt of such notification by both the other party and the Secretary.
<br>(2) Independent dispute resolution process available in case of failed open negotiations
<br>(A) Establishment
<br>
<br>Not later than 1 year after December 27, 2020, the Secretary, jointly with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of the Treasury, shall establish by regulation one independent dispute resolution process (referred to in this subsection as the "IDR process") under which, in the case of air ambulance services with respect to which a provider or group health plan or health insurance issuer offering group health insurance coverage submits a notification under paragraph (1)(B) (in this subsection referred to as a "qualified IDR air ambulance services"), a certified IDR entity under paragraph (4) determines, subject to subparagraph (B) and in accordance with the succeeding provisions of this subsection, the amount of payment under the plan or coverage for such services furnished by such provider.
<br>(B) Authority to continue negotiations
<br>
<br>Under the independent dispute resolution process, in the case that the parties to a determination for qualified IDR air ambulance services agree on a payment amount for such services during such process but before the date on which the entity selected with respect to such determination under paragraph (4) makes such determination under paragraph (5), such amount shall be treated for purposes of section 1185e(a)(3)(K)(ii) of this title as the amount agreed to by such parties for such services. In the case of an agreement described in the previous sentence, the independent dispute resolution process shall provide for a method to determine how to allocate between the parties to such determination the payment of the compensation of the entity selected with respect to such determination.
<br>(C) Clarification
<br>
<br>A nonparticipating provider may not, with respect to an item or service furnished by such provider, submit a notification under paragraph (1)(B) if such provider is exempt from the requirement under subsection (a) of section 300gg–132 of title 42 with respect to such item or service pursuant to subsection (b) of such section.
<br>(3) Treatment of batching of services
<br>
<br>The provisions of section 1185e(c)(3) of this title shall apply with respect to a notification submitted under this subsection with respect to air ambulance services in the same manner and to the same extent such provisions apply with respect to a notification submitted under section 1185e(c) of this title with respect to items and services described in such section.
<br>(4) IDR entities

An entity selected pursuant to the previous sentence to make a determination described in such sentence shall be referred to in this subsection as the "certified IDR entity" with respect to such determination.

<br>(iii) Prohibition on consideration of certain factors
<br>
