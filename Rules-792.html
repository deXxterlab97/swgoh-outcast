<br>
<br>If, for a month, the total amount of principal, interest, and associated fees that are owed on a covered loan for which the Administration makes payments under paragraph (1) is more than $9,000 the Administrator may require the lender with respect to the covered loan to add the amount by which those costs exceed $9,000 for that month as interest to be paid by the borrower with respect to the covered loan at the end of the loan period.
<br>(5) Additional provisions for new loans

<br>(A) not more than 60 days (which may be extended at the discretion of the Administration) after the occurrence of an adverse event, other than a payment default, causing a loan to be classified as in liquidation; and
<br>
<br>(B) not more than 90 days after a payment default.
<br>(e) Rule of construction

<br>
<br>For each individual lending program under this section, the Administrator may establish a minimum loan maturity period, taking into consideration the normal underwriting requirements for each such program, with the goal of preventing abuse under the program.

<br>
<br>The Administrator shall provide education, outreach, and communication to lenders, borrowers, district offices, and resource partners of the Administration in order to ensure full and proper compliance with this section, encourage broad participation with respect to covered loans that have not yet been approved by the Administrator, and help lenders transition borrowers from subsidy payments under this section directly to a deferral when suitable for the borrower.
