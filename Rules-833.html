<br>§1262. Transportation into State prohibiting sale
<br>
<br>Whoever imports, brings, or transports any intoxicating liquor into any State, Territory, District, or Possession in which all sales, except for scientific, sacramental, medicinal, or mechanical purposes, of intoxicating liquor containing more than 4 per centum of alcohol by volume or 3.2 per centum of alcohol by weight are prohibited, otherwise than in the course of continuous interstate transportation through such State, Territory, District, or Possession or attempts so to do, or assists in so doing,
<br>
<br>Shall (1) If such liquor is not accompanied by such permits, or licenses therefor as may be required by the laws of such State, Territory, District, or Possession or (2) if all importation, bringing, or transportation of intoxicating liquor into such State, Territory, District, or Possession is prohibited by the laws thereof, be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.
<br>
<br>In the enforcement of this section, the definition of intoxicating liquor contained in the laws of the respective States, Territories, Districts, or Possessions shall be applied, but only to the extent that sales of such intoxicating liquor (except for scientific, sacramental, medicinal, and mechanical purposes) are prohibited therein.
<br>

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>1948 Act
<br>
<br>Based on sections 222, 223 of title 27, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Intoxicating Liquors (June 25, 1936, ch. 815, §§2, 3, 49 Stat. 1928).
<br>
<br>Section consolidates subsection (a) of section 222 with section 223, of title 27, U.S.C., 1940 ed.
<br>
<br>Words "or 3.2 per centum of alcohol by weight" were inserted after "volume." Such words conform with Flippin v. U.S. (1941, 121 F. 2d 742, 744, certiorari denied, 62 S. Ct. 184, 314 U.S. 677, 86 L. Ed. 542); Robason v. U.S. (1941, 122 F. 2d 991); Dolloff v. U.S. (1941, 121 F. 2d 157, certiorari denied, 62 S. Ct. 108, 314 U.S. 626, 86 L. Ed. 503, rehearing denied, 62 S. Ct. 178, 314 U.S. 710, 86 L. Ed. 566); and Tucker v. U.S. (1941, 123 F. 2d 280).
<br>
<br>Those cases overruled Arnold v. U.S. (1940, 115 F. 2d 523) and Gregg v. U.S. (1940, 116 F. 2d 609) and established that preservation of the congressional intent which requires addition of the inserted language.
<br>
<br>Subsection (b) of section 223 of title 27, U.S.C., 1940 ed., has been reworded to apply the definition of intoxicating liquor contained in the laws of the respective States to this section only, in accordance with administrative interpretation. Said section 223 was derived from section 3 of the Liquor Enforcement Act of 1936 (Act June 25, 1936, ch. 815, 49 Stat. 1928), which was enacted for the protection of dry States. As originally enacted, its provisions relating to such definition also embraced the interstate commerce liquor laws from which sections 1263–1265 of this title were derived. In the enforcement of the latter, however, their own definitions have been applied and not the definitions of the States into which or through which the liquor was shipped.
<br>
<br>Words "Territory, District, or Possession" were inserted after "State", to conform with the definition of "State" given in said section 222 of title 27, U.S.C., 1940 ed. Such section, including subsection (b) thereof, is also incorporated in section 3615 of this title.
<br>
<br>Words "be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall" were omitted in view of definitive section 1 of this title.
<br>
<br>Minor changes were made throughout in arrangement and phraseology.

<br>§1263. Marks and labels on packages
<br>
<br>Whoever knowingly ships into any place within the United States any package containing any spirituous, vinous, malted, or other fermented liquor, or any compound containing any spirituous, vinous, malted, or other fermented liquor fit for use for beverage purposes, unless such shipment is accompanied by copy of a bill of lading, or other document showing the name of the consignee, the nature of its contents, and the quantity contained therein, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §390 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §240, 35 Stat. 1137; June 25, 1936, ch. 815, §8, 49 Stat. 1930.)
<br>
<br>Reference to persons causing or procuring was omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of "principal" in section 2 of this title.
<br>
<br>References to Territory, District, etc., were revised and same changes made as in section 1264 of this title.
<br>
<br>The provision that "such liquor shall be forfeited to the United States" was omitted as covered by section 3615 of this title, which was derived from section 224 of title 27, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Intoxicating Liquors.
<br>
<br>The provision that such liquor "may be seized and condemned by like proceedings as those provided by law for the seizure and forfeiture of property imported into the United States contrary to law" was likewise omitted as covered by section 3615 of this title, which provides for seizure and forfeiture under the internal revenue laws rather than under provisions of law "for the seizure and forfeiture of property imported into the United States contrary to law" or, in other words, rather than under the customs laws. Section 224 of title 27, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Intoxicating Liquors, on which said section 3615 of this title is based, was derived from the Liquor Enforcement Act of 1936 (Act June 25, 1936, ch. 815, 49 Stat. 1928). Said section 224 included, in its coverage, section 390 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., on which this revised section is based, even though the Liquor Enforcement Act of 1936, in another section thereof, in amending said section 390, retained the provision that seizures and forfeitures thereunder should be under the customs laws. By eliminating this conflicting provision, a uniform procedure for seizures and forfeitures, under the internal revenue laws, is established under said section 3615 of this title.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>1948 Act
<br>
<br>Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §338 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §215, 35 Stat. 1130).
<br>
<br>The obsolete argot of the underworld was deleted as suggested by Hon. Emerich B. Freed, United States district judge, in a paper read before the 1944 Judicial Conference for the sixth circuit in which he said:
<br>
<br>A brief reference to §1341, which proposes to reenact the present section covering the use of the mails to defraud. This section is almost a page in length, is involved, and contains a great deal of superfluous language, including such terms as "sawdust swindle, green articles, green coin, green goods and green cigars." This section could be greatly simplified, and now-meaningless language eliminated.
<br>
<br>The other surplusage was likewise eliminated and the section simplified without change of meaning.
<br>
<br>A reference to causing to be placed any letter, etc. in any post office, or station thereof, etc. was omitted as unnecessary because of definition of "principal" in section 2 of this title.
<br>1949 Act
<br>
<br>This section [section 34] corrects a typographical error in section 1341 of title 18, U.S.C.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §82 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §35, 35 Stat. 1095; Oct. 23, 1918, ch. 194, 40 Stat. 1015; June 18, 1934, ch. 587, 48 Stat. 996; Apr. 4, 1938, ch. 69, 52 Stat. 197).
<br>
<br>The embezzlement and theft provisions of section 82 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are now incorporated in section 641 of this title.
<br>
<br>Words "or any corporation in which the United States of America is a stockholder" were omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of "agency" in section 6 of this title.
<br>
<br>Designation of the place of confinement as "in a jail" was omitted because section 4082 of this title commits all prisoners to the custody of the Attorney General or his authorized representative, who shall designate the place of confinement. (See reviser's note under section 1 of this title.)
<br>
<br>The smaller penalty for offenses involving $50 or less was extended to offenses involving $100 or less. The use of $50 as the dividing line between felonies and misdemeanors originated at a time when that sum was of much greater value than $100 is now.
<br>
<br>The word "damage" was substituted twice for the word "value", and the definition of "value" was omitted as inapplicable to this section. These words and definition, however, are retained in that part of said section 82 which is now section 641 of this title.
<br>
<br>Minor changes were made in phraseology.
<br>
<br>Editorial Notes
<br>Amendments
<br>
<br>1996—Pub. L. 104–294, §605(e), inserted comma after "foregoing offenses" in first par.
