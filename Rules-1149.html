<br>(1) Broadcasting by the Television Marti Service shall be conducted in accordance with such parameters as shall be prescribed by the Federal Communications Commission to preclude objectionable interference with the broadcasts of any domestic licensee. The Television Marti Service shall be governed by the same standards regarding objectionable interference as any domestic licensee. The Federal Communications Commission shall monitor the operations of television broadcasting to Cuba pursuant to subsection (f). If, on the basis of such monitoring or a complaint from any person, the Federal Communications Commission determines, in its discretion, that broadcasting by the Television Marti Service is causing objectionable interference with the transmission or reception of the broadcasts of a domestic licensee, the Federal Communications Commission shall direct the Television Marti Service to cease broadcasting and to eliminate the objectionable interference. Broadcasts by the Service shall not be resumed until the Federal Communications Commission finds that the objectionable interference has been eliminated and should not recur.
<br>
<br>(2) The Federal Communications Commission shall take such actions as are necessary and appropriate to assist domestic licensees in overcoming the adverse effects of objectionable interference caused by broadcasting by the Television Marti Service. Such assistance may include the authorization of nondirectional increases in the effective radiated power of a domestic television station so that its coverage is equivalent to the maximum allowable for such facilities, to avoid any adverse effect on such stations of the broadcasts of the Television Marti Service.
<br>
<br>(3) If the Federal Communications Commission directs the Television Marti Service to cease broadcasting pursuant to paragraph (1), the Commission shall, as soon as practicable, notify the appropriate committees of Congress of such action and the reasons therefor. The Federal Communications Commission shall continue to notify the appropriate committees of Congress of progress in eliminating the objectionable interference and shall assure that Congress is fully informed about the operation of the Television Marti Service.
<br>(f) Monitoring of interference
<br>
<br>The Federal Communications Commission shall continually monitor and periodically report to the appropriate committees of the Congress interference to domestic broadcast licensees—
<br>
<br>(1) from the operation of Cuban television and radio stations; and
<br>
<br>(2) from the operations of the television broadcasting to Cuba.
<br>(g) Task force
<br>
<br>It is the sense of the Congress that the President should establish a task force to analyze the level of interference from the operation of Cuban television and radio stations experienced by broadcasters in the United States and to seek a practical political and technical solution to this problem.

<br>
<br>(II) are well-managed; and

<br>
<br>(I) lack appropriate goals or fail to achieve stated goals or desired results;

<br>
<br>(III) are not cost efficient, such as through insufficient use of available resources to achieve stated goals or desired results, or have excessive overhead; and
<br>
<br>(iv) "results not demonstrated" for activities that—
<br>
<br>(I) do not have acceptable performance public diplomacy metrics for measuring results; or

<br>
<br>"(a) Findings.—The Congress finds that the overriding national security aspects of the $1,300,000,000 facilities modernization program of the Voice of America require the assurance of uninterrupted logistic support under all circumstances for the program. Therefore, it is in the best interests of the United States to provide a preference for United States contractors bidding on the projects of this program.
<br>
<br>"(b) Responsive Bid.—A bid shall not be treated as a responsive bid for purposes of the facilities modernization program of the Voice of America unless the bidder can establish that the United States goods and services content, excluding consulting and management fees, of his proposal and the resulting contract will not be less than 55 percent of the value of his proposal and the resulting total contract.
<br>
<br>"(c) Preference for United States Contractors.—Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in any case where there are two or more qualified bidders on projects of the facilities modernization program of the Voice of America, including design and construction projects and projects with respect to transmitters, antennas, spare parts, and other technical equipment, all the responsive bids of United States persons and qualified United States joint venture persons shall be considered to be reduced by 10 percent.
<br>
<br>"(d) Exception.—

<br>
<br>"(i) its national public radio and television sector, or
<br>
<br>"(ii) its private radio and television sector, to the extent that such procurement or project is, in whole or in part, funded or otherwise under the control of a government agency or authority; or
<br>
<br>"(C) the Secretary of Commerce certifies (in advance of the award of the contract for that project) to the Director of the United States Information Agency that the foreign bidder is not receiving any direct subsidy from any government, the effect of which would be to disadvantage the competitive position of United States persons who also bid on the project; or
<br>
<br>"(D) the statutes of a host foreign country prohibit the use of United States contractors on such projects within that country.
<br>
<br>"(2) An exception under paragraph (1)(D) shall only become effective with respect to a foreign country 30 days after the Secretary of State certifies to the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate what specific actions the Secretary has taken to urge the foreign country to permit the use of United States contractors on such projects.
<br>
<br>"(d) [sic] Definitions.—For purposes of this section—
<br>
<br>"(1) the term 'United States person' means a person that—

<br>
<br>"(ii) employs United States citizens in more than half of its permanent, full-time positions in the United States; and
<br>
<br>"(iii) will employ United States citizens in at least 80 percent of the supervisory positions on the modernization project site; and
<br>
<br>"(F) has the existing technical and financial resources in the United States to perform the contract; and
<br>
<br>"(2) the term 'qualified United States joint venture person' means a joint venture in which a United States person or persons own at least 51 percent of the assets of the joint venture.
<br>
<br>"(e) Effective Date.—The provisions of this section shall apply to any project with respect to which the Request For Proposals (commonly referred to as 'RFP') or the Invitation For Bids (commonly referred to as 'IFB') was issued after December 28, 1986."

<br>
<br>(2) to make contracts, including contracts with governmental agencies, foreign or domestic, including subdivisions thereof, and intergovernmental organizations of which the United States is a member, and, with respect to contracts entered into in foreign countries, without regard to section 6306 of title 41;
<br>
<br>(3) under such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, to pay the transportation expenses, and not to exceed $10 per diem in lieu of subsistence and other expenses, of citizens or subjects of other countries, without regard to the Standardized Government Travel Regulations and the Subsistence Expense Act of 1926,1 as amended; and
<br>
<br>(4) to make grants for, and to pay expenses incident to, training and study.
<br>(b) Contracts for telecommunication activities, etc.; availability of appropriations; cancellation costs
<br>
<br>(1) Any contract authorized by subsection (a) and described in paragraph (3) of this subsection which is funded on the basis of annual appropriations may nevertheless be made for periods not in excess of 5 years when—
<br>
<br>(A) appropriations are available and adequate for payment for the first fiscal year and for all potential cancellation costs; and
<br>

<br>
<br>(i) the need of the Government for the property or service being acquired over the period of the contract is reasonably firm and continuing;
<br>
<br>(ii) such a contract will serve the best interests of the United States by encouraging effective competition or promoting economies in performance and operation; and
<br>
<br>(iii) such method of contracting will not inhibit small business participation.
<br>
<br>(2) In the event that funds are not made available for the continuation of such a contract into a subsequent fiscal year, the contract shall be canceled and any cancellation costs incurred shall be paid from appropriations originally available for the performance of the contract, appropriations currently available for the acquisition of similar property or services and not otherwise obligated, or appropriations made for such cancellation payments.
<br>
<br>(3) This subsection applies to contracts for the procurement of property or services, or both, for the operation, maintenance, and support of programs, facilities, and installations for or related to telecommunication activities, newswire services, and the distribution of books and other publications in foreign countries.
<br>
<br>(4)(A) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this subsection, the Broadcasting Board of Governors is authorized to enter into contracts for periods not to exceed 7 years for circuit capacity to distribute radio and television programs and is authorized to enter into contracts for periods not to exceed ten years to acquire local broadcasting services outside the United States.

<br>
<br>Except as provided in subsection (b), the Department of State shall work to achieve full and open competition in the award of grants for carrying out its overseas public diplomacy functions.
<br>(b) Exceptions
<br>
<br>The Department of State may award an overseas public diplomacy grant under procedures other than competitive procedures when—
<br>
<br>(1) such a grant is made under the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961 (commonly known as the Fulbright-Hays Act) [22 U.S.C. 2451 et seq.] or any statute which expressly authorizes or requires that a grant be made with a specified entity;
<br>
<br>(2) the terms of an international agreement or treaty between the United States Government and a foreign government or international organization have the effect of requiring the use of procedures other than competitive procedures;
<br>
<br>(3) a recipient organization has developed particular expertise in the planning and administration of longstanding exchange programs important to United States foreign policy; or
<br>
<br>(4) introducing competition would increase costs.
<br>(c) Compliance with grant guidelines
<br>
<br>(1) After October 1, 1991, overseas public diplomacy grants awarded by the Department of State shall substantially comply with Department of State grant guidelines and applicable circulars of the Office of Management and Budget.
<br>
<br>(2) If the Agency 1 determines that a grantee has not satisfied the requirement of paragraph (1), the Department of State shall notify the grantee of the suspension of payments under a grant unless compliance is achieved within 90 days of such notice.
<br>
<br>(3) The Agency 1 shall suspend payments under any such grant which remains in noncompliance 90 days after notification under paragraph (2).
