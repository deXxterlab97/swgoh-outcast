<br>
<br>"The subtitle may be cited as the 'Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Rewards Act'.
<br>"SEC. 9702. SENSE OF CONGRESS.
<br>
<br>"It is the sense of Congress that a stolen asset recovery rewards program to help identify and recover stolen assets linked to foreign government corruption and the proceeds of such corruption hidden behind complex financial structures is needed in order to—
<br>
<br>"(1) intensify the global fight against corruption; and
<br>
<br>"(2) serve United States efforts to identify and recover such stolen assets, forfeit proceeds of such corruption, and, where appropriate and feasible, return the stolen assets or proceeds thereof to the country harmed by the acts of corruption.
<br>"SEC. 9703. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY KLEPTOCRACY ASSET RECOVERY REWARDS PILOT PROGRAM.
<br>
<br>"(a) Establishment.—
<br>
<br>"(1) In general.—There is established in the Department of the Treasury a program to be known as the 'Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Rewards Pilot Program' for the payment of rewards to carry out the purposes of this section.
<br>
<br>"(2) Purpose.—The rewards program shall be designed to support U.S. Government programs and investigations aimed at restraining, seizing, forfeiting, or repatriating stolen assets linked to foreign government corruption and the proceeds of such corruption.
<br>
<br>"(3) Implementation.—The rewards program shall be administered by the Secretary of the Treasury, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, and in consultation, as appropriate, with the heads of such other departments and agencies as the Secretary may find appropriate.
<br>
<br>"(b) Rewards Authorized.—The Secretary of the Treasury may, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, and in consultation, as appropriate, with the heads of other relevant Federal departments and agencies, pay a reward to any individual, if that individual furnishes information leading to—
<br>
<br>"(1) the restraining or seizure of stolen assets in an account at a U.S. financial institution (including a U.S. branch of a foreign financial institution), that come within the United States, or that come within the possession or control of any United States person;
<br>
<br>"(2) the forfeiture of stolen assets in an account at a U.S. financial institution (including a U.S. branch of a foreign financial institution), that come within the United States, or that come within the possession or control of any United States person; or
<br>
<br>"(3) where appropriate, the repatriation of stolen assets in an account at a U.S. financial institution (including a U.S. branch of a foreign financial institution), that come within the United States, or that come within the possession or control of any United States person.
<br>
<br>"(c) Procedures.—To ensure that the payment of rewards pursuant to this section does not duplicate or interfere with any other payment authorized by the Department of Justice or other Federal agencies for the obtaining of information or other evidence, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the heads of such other agencies as the Secretary may find appropriate, shall establish procedures for the offering, administration, and payment of rewards under this section, including procedures for—
<br>
<br>"(1) identifying actions with respect to which rewards will be offered;
<br>
<br>"(2) the receipt and analysis of data; and
<br>
<br>"(3) the payment of rewards and approval of such payments.
<br>
<br>"(d) Payment of Rewards.—
<br>
<br>"(1) Authorization of appropriations.—For the purpose of paying rewards pursuant to this section, there is authorized to be appropriated—

<br>"(A) $450,000 for fiscal year 2021; and
<br>
<br>"(B) for each fiscal year, any amount, not to exceed the amount recovered during the fiscal year in stolen assets described under subsection (b), that the Secretary determines is necessary to carry out this program consistent with this section.
<br>
<br>"(2) Limitation on annual payments.—Except as provided under paragraph (3), the total amount of rewards paid pursuant to this section may not exceed $25 million in any calendar year.
<br>
<br>"(3) Presidential authority.—The President may waive the limitation under paragraph (2) with respect to a calendar year if the President provides written notice of such waiver to the appropriate committees of the Congress at least 30 days before any payment in excess of such limitation is made pursuant to this section.
<br>
<br>"(4) Priority of payments.—In paying any reward under this section, the Secretary shall, to the extent possible, make such reward payment—
<br>
<br>"(A) first, from appropriated funds authorized under paragraph (1)(A); and
<br>
<br>"(B) second, from appropriated funds authorized under paragraph (1)(B).
<br>
<br>"(e) Limitations.—

<br>"(1) Submission of information.—No award may be made under this section based on information submitted to the Secretary unless such information is submitted under penalty of perjury.
<br>
<br>"(2) Maximum amount.—No reward paid under this section may exceed $5 million, unless the Secretary—
<br>
<br>"(A) personally authorizes such greater amount in writing;
<br>
<br>"(B) determines that offer or payment of a reward of a greater amount is necessary due to the exceptional nature of the case; and
<br>
<br>"(C) notifies the appropriate committees of the Congress of such determination.
<br>
<br>"(3) Approval.—
<br>
<br>"(A) In general.—No reward amount may be paid under this section without the written approval of the Secretary, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State and the Attorney General.

<br>
<br>"(4) Protection measures.—If the Secretary determines that the identity of the recipient of a reward or of the members of the recipient's immediate family must be protected, the Secretary shall, consistent with applicable law, take such measures in connection with the payment of the reward as the Secretary considers necessary to effect such protection.
<br>
<br>"(5) Forms of reward payment.—The Secretary may make a reward under this section in the form of a monetary payment.
<br>
<br>"(f) Ineligibility, Reduction in, or Denial of Reward.—
<br>

<br>
<br>"(h) Report on Disposition of Recovered Assets.—Within 360 days of the enactment of this Act [Jan. 1, 2021], the Secretary of the Treasury, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, shall issue a report to the appropriate committees of Congress describing policy choices and recommendations for disposition of stolen assets recovered pursuant to this section.

<br>§9703. Managerial accountability and flexibility
<br>
<br>(a) Beginning with fiscal year 1999, the performance plans required under section 1115 may include proposals to waive administrative procedural requirements and controls, including specification of personnel staffing levels, limitations on compensation or remuneration, and prohibitions or restrictions on funding transfers among budget object classification 20 and subclassifications 11, 12, 31, and 32 of each annual budget submitted under section 1105, in return for specific individual or organization accountability to achieve a performance goal. In preparing and submitting the performance plan under section 1105(a)(29),1 the Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall review and may approve any proposed waivers. A waiver shall take effect at the beginning of the fiscal year for which the waiver is approved.
<br>
<br>(b) Any such proposal under subsection (a) shall describe the anticipated effects on performance resulting from greater managerial or organizational flexibility, discretion, and authority, and shall quantify the expected improvements in performance resulting from any waiver. The expected improvements shall be compared to current actual performance, and to the projected level of performance that would be achieved independent of any waiver.
<br>
<br>(c) Any proposal waiving limitations on compensation or remuneration shall precisely express the monetary change in compensation or remuneration amounts, such as bonuses or awards, that shall result from meeting, exceeding, or failing to meet performance goals.
<br>
<br>(d) Any proposed waiver of procedural requirements or controls imposed by an agency (other than the proposing agency or the Office of Management and Budget) may not be included in a performance plan unless it is endorsed by the agency that established the requirement, and the endorsement included in the proposing agency's performance plan.
<br>
<br>(e) A waiver shall be in effect for one or two years as specified by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget in approving the waiver. A waiver may be renewed for a subsequent year. After a waiver has been in effect for three consecutive years, the performance plan prepared under section 1115 may propose that a waiver, other than a waiver of limitations on compensation or remuneration, be made permanent.
<br>
<br>(f) For purposes of this section, the definitions under section 1115(f) 1 shall apply.
