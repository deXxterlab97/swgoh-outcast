<br>In subsection (c)(2), the words "may not prevent" are substituted for "Nor shall it be prohibited . . . to prevent" to reflect the probable intent of Congress.

<br>§41104. Common carriers
<br>
<br>(a) In General.—A common carrier, either alone or in conjunction with any other person, directly or indirectly, may not—
<br>
<br>(1) allow a person to obtain transportation for property at less than the rates or charges established by the carrier in its tariff or service contract by means of false billing, false classification, false weighing, false measurement, or any other unjust or unfair device or means;
<br>
<br>(2) provide service in the liner trade that is—
<br>
<br>(A) not in accordance with the rates, charges, classifications, rules, and practices contained in a tariff published or a service contract entered into under chapter 405 of this title, unless excepted or exempted under section 40103 or 40501(a)(2) of this title; or
<br>
<br>(B) under a tariff or service contract that has been suspended or prohibited by the Federal Maritime Commission under chapter 407 or 423 of this title;
<br>
<br>(3) retaliate against a shipper by refusing, or threatening to refuse, cargo space accommodations when available, or resort to other unfair or unjustly discriminatory methods because the shipper has patronized another carrier, or has filed a complaint, or for any other reason;
<br>
<br>(4) for service pursuant to a tariff, engage in any unfair or unjustly discriminatory practice in the matter of—
<br>
<br>(A) rates or charges;
<br>
<br>(B) cargo classifications;
<br>
<br>(C) cargo space accommodations or other facilities, with due regard being given to the proper loading of the vessel and the available tonnage;
<br>
<br>(D) loading and landing of freight; or
<br>
<br>(E) adjustment and settlement of claims;
<br>
<br>(5) for service pursuant to a service contract, engage in any unfair or unjustly discriminatory practice in the matter of rates or charges with respect to any port;
<br>
<br>(6) use a vessel in a particular trade for the purpose of excluding, preventing, or reducing competition by driving another ocean common carrier out of that trade;
<br>
<br>(7) offer or pay any deferred rebates;
<br>
<br>(8) for service pursuant to a tariff, give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage or impose any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage;
<br>
<br>(9) for service pursuant to a service contract, give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage or impose any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage with respect to any port;
<br>
<br>(10) unreasonably refuse to deal or negotiate;
<br>
<br>(11) knowingly and willfully accept cargo from or transport cargo for the account of a non-vessel-operating common carrier that does not have a tariff as required by section 40501 of this title, or an ocean transportation intermediary that does not have a bond, insurance, or other surety as required by section 40902 of this title;
<br>
<br>(12) knowingly and willfully enter into a service contract with an ocean transportation intermediary that does not have a tariff as required by section 40501 of this title and a bond, insurance, or other surety as required by section 40902 of this title, or with an affiliate of such an ocean transportation intermediary; or
<br>
<br>(13) continue to participate simultaneously in a rate discussion agreement and an agreement to share vessels, in the same trade, if the interplay of the authorities exercised by the specified agreements is likely, by a reduction in competition, to produce an unreasonable reduction in transportation service or an unreasonable increase in transportation cost.
<br>
<br>(b) Rule of Construction.—Notwithstanding any other provision of law, there is no private right of action to enforce the prohibition under subsection (a)(13).
<br>
<br>(c) Agreement Violation.—Participants in an agreement found by the Commission to violate subsection (a)(13) shall have 90 days from the date of such Commission finding to withdraw from the agreement as necessary to comply with that subsection.

<br>
<br>(a) Suspension of Tariffs.—For a violation of section 41104(1), (2), or (7) 1 of this title, the Federal Maritime Commission may suspend any or all tariffs of the common carrier, or that common carrier's right to use any or all tariffs of conferences of which it is a member, for a period not to exceed 12 months.
<br>
<br>(b) Operating Under Suspended Tariff.—A common carrier that accepts or handles cargo for carriage under a tariff that has been suspended, or after its right to use that tariff has been suspended, is liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty of not more than $50,000 for each shipment.
<br>
<br>(c) Failure To Provide Information.—
<br>
<br>(1) Penalties.—If the Commission finds, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that a common carrier has failed to supply information ordered to be produced or compelled by subpoena under section 41303 of this title, the Commission may—
<br>
<br>(A) suspend any or all tariffs of the carrier or the carrier's right to use any or all tariffs of conferences of which it is a member; and
<br>
<br>(B) request the Secretary of Homeland Security to refuse or revoke any clearance required for a vessel operated by the carrier, and when so requested, the Secretary shall refuse or revoke the clearance.
<br>
<br>(2) Defense based on foreign law.—If, in defense of its failure to comply with a subpoena or discovery order, a common carrier alleges that information or documents located in a foreign country cannot be produced because of the laws of that country, the Commission shall immediately notify the Secretary of State of the failure to comply and of the allegation relating to foreign laws. On receiving the notification, the Secretary of State shall promptly consult with the government of the nation within which the information or documents are alleged to be located for the purpose of assisting the Commission in obtaining the information or documents.
<br>
<br>(d) Impairing Access to Foreign Trade.—If the Commission finds, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that the action of a common carrier, acting alone or in concert with another person, or a foreign government has unduly impaired access of a vessel documented under the laws of the United States to ocean trade between foreign ports, the Commission shall take action that it finds appropriate, including imposing any of the penalties authorized by this section. The Commission also may take any of the actions authorized by sections 42304 and 42305 of this title.
<br>
<br>(e) Submission of Order to President.—Before an order under this section becomes effective, it shall be submitted immediately to the President. The President, within 10 days after receiving it, may disapprove it if the President finds that disapproval is required for reasons of national defense or foreign policy.

<br>§41109. Assessment of penalties
<br>
<br>(a) General Authority.—Until a matter is referred to the Attorney General, the Federal Maritime Commission may, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, assess a civil penalty provided for in this part. The Commission may compromise, modify, or remit, with or without conditions, a civil penalty.
<br>
<br>(b) Factors in Determining Amount.—In determining the amount of a civil penalty, the Commission shall take into account the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation committed and, with respect to the violator, the degree of culpability, history of prior offenses, ability to pay, and other matters justice may require.
<br>
<br>(c) Exception.—A civil penalty may not be imposed for conspiracy to violate section 41102(a) or 41104(1) or (2) 1 of this title or to defraud the Commission by concealing such a violation.
<br>
<br>(d) Prohibited Basis of Penalty.—The Commission or a court may not order a person to pay the difference between the amount billed and agreed upon in writing with a common carrier or its agent and the amount set forth in a tariff or service contract by that common carrier for the transportation service provided.

<br>(e) Time Limit.—A proceeding to assess a civil penalty under this section must be commenced within 5 years after the date of the violation.
<br>

The court shall enforce the order of the Commission unless it finds that the order was not regularly made and duly issued.

<br>
<br>(b) Reduction in Competition.—
<br>
<br>(1) Action by commission.—If, at any time after the filing or effective date of an agreement under chapter 403 of this title, the Commission determines that the agreement is likely, by a reduction in competition, to produce an unreasonable reduction in transportation service or an unreasonable increase in transportation cost or to substantially lessen competition in the purchasing of certain covered services, the Commission, after notice to the person filing the agreement, may bring a civil action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to enjoin the operation of the agreement. The Commission's sole remedy with respect to an agreement likely to have such an effect is an action under this subsection.
<br>
<br>(2) Remedies by court.—In an action under this subsection, the court may issue—
<br>
<br>(A) a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction; and
<br>
<br>(B) a permanent injunction after a showing that the agreement is likely to have the effect described in paragraph (1).
<br>
<br>(3) Burden of proof and third parties.—In an action under this subsection, the burden of proof is on the Commission. The court may not allow a third party to intervene.
<br>
<br>(4) Competition factors.—In making a determination under this subsection regarding whether an agreement is likely to substantially lessen competition in the purchasing of certain covered services, the Commission may consider any relevant competition factors in affected markets, including, without limitation, the competitive effect of agreements other than the agreement under review.
<br>
<br>(c) Failure To Provide Information.—If a person filing an agreement, or an officer, director, partner, agent, or employee of the person, fails substantially to comply with a request for the submission of additional information or documents within the period provided in section 40304(c) of this title, the Commission may bring a civil action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. At the request of the Commission, the Court—
<br>
<br>(1) may order compliance;
<br>
<br>(2) shall extend the period specified in section 40304(c)(2) of this title until there has been substantial compliance; and
<br>
<br>(3) may grant other equitable relief that the court decides is appropriate.
<br>
<br>(d) Representation.—The Commission may represent itself in a proceeding under this section in—
<br>
<br>(1) a district court of the United States, on notice to the Attorney General; and
<br>
<br>(2) a court of appeals of the United States, with the approval of the Attorney General.

<br>
<br>(b) Parties and Service of Process.—All parties in whose favor the Commission has made an award of reparation by a single order may be joined as plaintiffs, and all other parties in the order may be joined as defendants, in a single action in a judicial district in which any one plaintiff could maintain an action against any one defendant. Service of process against a defendant not found in that district may be made in a district in which any office of that defendant is located or in which any port of call on a regular route operated by that defendant is located. Judgment may be entered for any plaintiff against the defendant liable to that plaintiff.

<br>
<br>(d) Costs and Attorney Fees.—The plaintiff is not liable for costs of the action or for costs of any subsequent stage of the proceedings unless they accrue on the plaintiff's appeal. A prevailing plaintiff shall be allowed reasonable attorney fees to be assessed and collected as part of the costs of the action.

The text of 46 App. U.S.C. 1710a(h), insofar as it relates to 46 App. U.S.C. 876(a)(2), is omitted as unnecessary because this chapter already provides for the same remedies as those authorized by the omitted provision.

Any person, including a common carrier, tramp operator, bulk operator, shipper, shippers' association, ocean transportation intermediary, marine terminal operator, or any component of the Government of the United States, may file a petition for relief under subsection (a)(2) of this section." for consistency with section 42302(b) of the revised title and to eliminate unnecessary words.
<br>§42102. Regulations of other agencies
<br>
<br>(a) Request to Agency.—To further the objectives and policy set forth in section 50101 of this title, the Federal Maritime Commission shall request the head of a department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States Government to suspend, modify, or annul any existing regulations, or to make new regulations, affecting shipping in the foreign trade, except regulations relating to the Public Health Service, the Consular Service, or the inspection of vessels.
<br>
<br>(b) Prior Review and Approval.—A department, agency, or instrumentality of the Government may not prescribe a regulation affecting shipping in the foreign trade (except a regulation affecting the Public Health Service, the Consular Service, or the inspection of vessels) until the regulation has been submitted to the Commission for its approval and final action has been taken by the Commission or the President.
<br>
<br>(c) Submission to President.—If the head of a department, agency, or instrumentality of the Government refuses to comply with a request under subsection (a) or objects to a decision of the Commission under subsection (b), the Commission or the head of the department, agency, or instrumentality may submit the facts to the President. The President may establish, suspend, modify, or annul the regulation.

<br>(c) Witness Fees.—Unless otherwise prohibited by law, and subject to funds being appropriated, a witness in a proceeding under section 42101 of this title is entitled to the same fees and mileage as in the courts of the United States.
<br>
<br>(d) Penalties.—For failure to supply information ordered to be produced or compelled by subpoena under this section, the Commission may—
