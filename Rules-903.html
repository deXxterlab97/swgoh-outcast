<br>(a) "Upstream subsidy" defined
<br>
<br>The term "upstream subsidy" means any countervailable subsidy, other than an export subsidy, that—
<br>
<br>(1) is paid or bestowed by an authority (as defined in section 1677(5) of this title) with respect to a product (hereafter in this section referred to as an "input product") that is used in the same country as the authority in the manufacture or production of merchandise which is the subject of a countervailing duty proceeding;
<br>
<br>(2) in the judgment of the administering authority bestows a competitive benefit on the merchandise; and
<br>
<br>(3) has a significant effect on the cost of manufacturing or producing the merchandise.
<br>
<br>In applying this subsection, an association of two or more foreign countries, political subdivisions, dependent territories, or possessions of foreign countries organized into a customs union outside the United States shall be treated as being one country if the countervailable subsidy is provided by the customs union.
<br>(b) Determination of competitive benefit
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in paragraph (2), the administering authority shall decide that a competitive benefit has been bestowed when the price for the input product referred to in subsection (a)(1) for such use is lower than the price that the manufacturer or producer of merchandise which is the subject of a countervailing duty proceeding would otherwise pay for the product in obtaining it from another seller in an arms-length transaction.
<br>(2) Adjustments
<br>
<br>If the administering authority has determined in a previous proceeding that a countervailable subsidy is paid or bestowed on the input product that is used for comparison under paragraph (1), the administering authority may (A) where appropriate, adjust the price that the manufacturer or producer of merchandise which is the subject of such proceeding would otherwise pay for the product to reflect the effects of the countervailable subsidy, or (B) select in lieu of that price a price from another source.
<br>(c) Inclusion of amount of countervailable subsidy
<br>
<br>If the administering authority decides, during the course of a countervailing duty proceeding that an upstream countervailable subsidy is being or has been paid or bestowed regarding the subject merchandise, the administering authority shall include in the amount of any countervailing duty imposed on the merchandise an amount equal to the amount of the competitive benefit referred to in subparagraph (1)(B),1 except that in no event shall the amount be greater than the amount of the countervailable subsidy determined with respect to the upstream product.

<br>(b) Constructed export price
<br>
<br>The term "constructed export price" means the price at which the subject merchandise is first sold (or agreed to be sold) in the United States before or after the date of importation by or for the account of the producer or exporter of such merchandise or by a seller affiliated with the producer or exporter, to a purchaser not affiliated with the producer or exporter, as adjusted under subsections (c) and (d).
<br>(c) Adjustments for export price and constructed export price
<br>
<br>The price used to establish export price and constructed export price shall be—
<br>
<br>(1) increased by—
<br>
<br>(A) when not included in such price, the cost of all containers and coverings and all other costs, charges, and expenses incident to placing the subject merchandise in condition packed ready for shipment to the United States,

<br>
<br>(2) reduced by—
<br>
<br>(A) except as provided in paragraph (1)(C), the amount, if any, included in such price, attributable to any additional costs, charges, or expenses, and United States import duties, which are incident to bringing the subject merchandise from the original place of shipment in the exporting country to the place of delivery in the United States, and
<br>
<br>(B) the amount, if included in such price, of any export tax, duty, or other charge imposed by the exporting country on the exportation of the subject merchandise to the United States, other than an export tax, duty, or other charge described in section 1677(6)(C) of this title.
<br>(d) Additional adjustments to constructed export price
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, the price used to establish constructed export price shall also be reduced by—
<br>
<br>(1) the amount of any of the following expenses generally incurred by or for the account of the producer or exporter, or the affiliated seller in the United States, in selling the subject merchandise (or subject merchandise to which value has been added)—
<br>
<br>(A) commissions for selling the subject merchandise in the United States;
<br>
<br>(B) expenses that result from, and bear a direct relationship to, the sale, such as credit expenses, guarantees and warranties;
<br>
<br>(C) any selling expenses that the seller pays on behalf of the purchaser; and
<br>
<br>(D) any selling expenses not deducted under subparagraph (A), (B), or (C);
<br>
<br>(2) the cost of any further manufacture or assembly (including additional material and labor), except in circumstances described in subsection (e); and
<br>
<br>(3) the profit allocated to the expenses described in paragraphs (1) and (2).
<br>(e) Special rule for merchandise with value added after importation
<br>
<br>Where the subject merchandise is imported by a person affiliated with the exporter or producer, and the value added in the United States by the affiliated person is likely to exceed substantially the value of the subject merchandise, the administering authority shall determine the constructed export price for such merchandise by using one of the following prices if there is a sufficient quantity of sales to provide a reasonable basis for comparison and the administering authority determines that the use of such sales is appropriate:
<br>
<br>(1) The price of identical subject merchandise sold by the exporter or producer to an unaffiliated person.
<br>
<br>(2) The price of other subject merchandise sold by the exporter or producer to an unaffiliated person.
<br>
<br>If there is not a sufficient quantity of sales to provide a reasonable basis for comparison under paragraph (1) or (2), or the administering authority determines that neither of the prices described in such paragraphs is appropriate, then the constructed export price may be determined on any other reasonable basis.
<br>(f) Special rule for determining profit
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>For purposes of subsection (d)(3), profit shall be an amount determined by multiplying the total actual profit by the applicable percentage.
<br>(2) Definitions

<br>
<br>(i) The expenses incurred with respect to the subject merchandise sold in the United States and the foreign like product sold in the exporting country if such expenses were requested by the administering authority for the purpose of establishing normal value and constructed export price.
<br>
<br>(ii) The expenses incurred with respect to the narrowest category of merchandise sold in the United States and the exporting country which includes the subject merchandise.
<br>
<br>(iii) The expenses incurred with respect to the narrowest category of merchandise sold in all countries which includes the subject merchandise.
<br>(D) Total actual profit
<br>
<br>The term "total actual profit" means the total profit earned by the foreign producer, exporter, and affiliated parties described in subparagraph (C) with respect to the sale of the same merchandise for which total expenses are determined under such subparagraph.

<br>§1677b. Normal value
<br>(a) Determination
<br>
<br>In determining under this subtitle whether subject merchandise is being, or is likely to be, sold at less than fair value, a fair comparison shall be made between the export price or constructed export price and normal value. In order to achieve a fair comparison with the export price or constructed export price, normal value shall be determined as follows:
<br>(1) Determination of normal value
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The normal value of the subject merchandise shall be the price described in subparagraph (B), at a time reasonably corresponding to the time of the sale used to determine the export price or constructed export price under section 1677a(a) or (b) of this title.
<br>(B) Price
<br>
<br>The price referred to in subparagraph (A) is—
<br>
<br>(i) the price at which the foreign like product is first sold (or, in the absence of a sale, offered for sale) for consumption in the exporting country, in the usual commercial quantities and in the ordinary course of trade and, to the extent practicable, at the same level of trade as the export price or constructed export price, or
<br>
<br>(ii) in a case to which subparagraph (C) applies, the price at which the foreign like product is so sold (or offered for sale) for consumption in a country other than the exporting country or the United States, if—
<br>
<br>(I) such price is representative,
<br>
<br>(II) the aggregate quantity (or, if quantity is not appropriate, value) of the foreign like product sold by the exporter or producer in such other country is 5 percent or more of the aggregate quantity (or value) of the subject merchandise sold in the United States or for export to the United States, and
<br>
<br>(III) the administering authority does not determine that the particular market situation prevents a proper comparison with the export price or constructed export price.
<br>(C) Third country sales
<br>
<br>This subparagraph applies when—
<br>
<br>(i) the foreign like product is not sold (or offered for sale) for consumption in the exporting country as described in subparagraph (B)(i),
<br>
<br>(ii) the administering authority determines that the aggregate quantity (or, if quantity is not appropriate, value) of the foreign like product sold in the exporting country is insufficient to permit a proper comparison with the sales of the subject merchandise to the United States, or
<br>
<br>(iii) the particular market situation in the exporting country does not permit a proper comparison with the export price or constructed export price.
<br>
<br>For purposes of clause (ii), the aggregate quantity (or value) of the foreign like product sold in the exporting country shall normally be considered to be insufficient if such quantity (or value) is less than 5 percent of the aggregate quantity (or value) of sales of the subject merchandise to the United States.
<br>(2) Fictitious markets
<br>
<br>No pretended sale or offer for sale, and no sale or offer for sale intended to establish a fictitious market, shall be taken into account in determining normal value. The occurrence of different movements in the prices at which different forms of the foreign like product are sold (or, in the absence of sales, offered for sale) in the exporting country after the issuance of an antidumping duty order may be considered by the administering authority as evidence of the establishment of a fictitious market for the foreign like product if the movement in such prices appears to reduce the amount by which the normal value exceeds the export price (or the constructed export price) of the subject merchandise.
<br>(3) Exportation from an intermediate country
<br>
<br>Where the subject merchandise is exported to the United States from an intermediate country, normal value shall be determined in the intermediate country, except that normal value may be determined in the country of origin of the subject merchandise if—
<br>
<br>(A) the producer knew at the time of the sale that the subject merchandise was destined for exportation;
<br>
<br>(B) the subject merchandise is merely transshipped through the intermediate country;
<br>
<br>(C) sales of the foreign like product in the intermediate country do not satisfy the conditions of paragraph (1)(C); or
<br>
<br>(D) the foreign like product is not produced in the intermediate country.
<br>(4) Use of constructed value
<br>
<br>If the administering authority determines that the normal value of the subject merchandise cannot be determined under paragraph (1)(B)(i), then, notwithstanding paragraph (1)(B)(ii), the normal value of the subject merchandise may be the constructed value of that merchandise, as determined under subsection (e).
<br>(5) Indirect sales or offers for sale
<br>
<br>If the foreign like product is sold or, in the absence of sales, offered for sale through an affiliated party, the prices at which the foreign like product is sold (or offered for sale) by such affiliated party may be used in determining normal value.
<br>(6) Adjustments
<br>
<br>The price described in paragraph (1)(B) shall be—
<br>
<br>(A) increased by the cost of all containers and coverings and all other costs, charges, and expenses incident to placing the subject merchandise in condition packed ready for shipment to the United States;
<br>
<br>(B) reduced by—
<br>
<br>(i) when included in the price described in paragraph (1)(B), the cost of all containers and coverings and all other costs, charges, and expenses incident to placing the foreign like product in condition packed ready for shipment to the place of delivery to the purchaser,
<br>
<br>(ii) the amount, if any, included in the price described in paragraph (1)(B), attributable to any additional costs, charges, and expenses incident to bringing the foreign like product from the original place of shipment to the place of delivery to the purchaser, and
<br>
<br>(iii) the amount of any taxes imposed directly upon the foreign like product or components thereof which have been rebated, or which have not been collected, on the subject merchandise, but only to the extent that such taxes are added to or included in the price of the foreign like product, and
<br>
<br>(C) increased or decreased by the amount of any difference (or lack thereof) between the export price or constructed export price and the price described in paragraph (1)(B) (other than a difference for which allowance is otherwise provided under this section) that is established to the satisfaction of the administering authority to be wholly or partly due to—
<br>
<br>(i) the fact that the quantities in which the subject merchandise is sold or agreed to be sold to the United States are greater than or less than the quantities in which the foreign like product is sold, agreed to be sold, or offered for sale,
<br>
<br>(ii) the fact that merchandise described in subparagraph (B) or (C) of section 1677(16) of this title is used in determining normal value, or
<br>
<br>(iii) other differences in the circumstances of sale.
<br>(7) Additional adjustments
<br>(A) Level of trade
<br>
<br>The price described in paragraph (1)(B) shall also be increased or decreased to make due allowance for any difference (or lack thereof) between the export price or constructed export price and the price described in paragraph (1)(B) (other than a difference for which allowance is otherwise made under this section) that is shown to be wholly or partly due to a difference in level of trade between the export price or constructed export price and normal value, if the difference in level of trade—
<br>
<br>(i) involves the performance of different selling activities; and
<br>
<br>(ii) is demonstrated to affect price comparability, based on a pattern of consistent price differences between sales at different levels of trade in the country in which normal value is determined.
<br>
<br>In a case described in the preceding sentence, the amount of the adjustment shall be based on the price differences between the two levels of trade in the country in which normal value is determined.
<br>(B) Constructed export price offset
<br>
<br>When normal value is established at a level of trade which constitutes a more advanced stage of distribution than the level of trade of the constructed export price, but the data available do not provide an appropriate basis to determine under subparagraph (A)(ii) a level of trade adjustment, normal value shall be reduced by the amount of indirect selling expenses incurred in the country in which normal value is determined on sales of the foreign like product but not more than the amount of such expenses for which a deduction is made under section 1677a(d)(1)(D) of this title.
<br>(8) Adjustments to constructed value
<br>
<br>Constructed value as determined under subsection (e), may be adjusted, as appropriate, pursuant to this subsection.
<br>(b) Sales at less than cost of production
<br>(1) Determination; sales disregarded
<br>
<br>Whenever the administering authority has reasonable grounds to believe or suspect that sales of the foreign like product under consideration for the determination of normal value have been made at prices which represent less than the cost of production of that product, the administering authority shall determine whether, in fact, such sales were made at less than the cost of production. If the administering authority determines that sales made at less than the cost of production—
<br>
<br>(A) have been made within an extended period of time in substantial quantities, and
<br>
<br>(B) were not at prices which permit recovery of all costs within a reasonable period of time,
<br>
<br>such sales may be disregarded in the determination of normal value. Whenever such sales are disregarded, normal value shall be based on the remaining sales of the foreign like product in the ordinary course of trade. If no sales made in the ordinary course of trade remain, the normal value shall be based on the constructed value of the merchandise.
<br>(2) Definitions and special rules
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subsection—
<br>(A) Reasonable grounds to believe or suspect
<br>(i) Review
<br>
<br>In a review conducted under section 1675 of this title involving a specific exporter, there are reasonable grounds to believe or suspect that sales of the foreign like product have been made at prices that are less than the cost of production of the product if the administering authority disregarded some or all of the exporter's sales pursuant to paragraph (1) in the investigation or, if a review has been completed, in the most recently completed review.
<br>(ii) Requests for information
<br>
<br>In an investigation initiated under section 1673a of this title or a review conducted under section 1675 of this title, the administering authority shall request information necessary to calculate the constructed value and cost of production under subsections (e) and (f) to determine whether there are reasonable grounds to believe or suspect that sales of the foreign like product have been made at prices that represent less than the cost of production of the product.
<br>(B) Extended period of time
<br>
<br>The term "extended period of time" means a period that is normally 1 year, but not less than 6 months.
<br>(C) Substantial quantities
<br>
<br>Sales made at prices below the cost of production have been made in substantial quantities if—
<br>
<br>(i) the volume of such sales represents 20 percent or more of the volume of sales under consideration for the determination of normal value, or
<br>
<br>(ii) the weighted average per unit price of the sales under consideration for the determination of normal value is less than the weighted average per unit cost of production for such sales.
<br>(D) Recovery of costs
<br>
<br>If prices which are below the per unit cost of production at the time of sale are above the weighted average per unit cost of production for the period of investigation or review, such prices shall be considered to provide for recovery of costs within a reasonable period of time.
<br>(3) Calculation of cost of production
<br>
<br>For purposes of this part, the cost of production shall be an amount equal to the sum of—
<br>
<br>(A) the cost of materials and of fabrication or other processing of any kind employed in producing the foreign like product, during a period which would ordinarily permit the production of that foreign like product in the ordinary course of business;
<br>
<br>(B) an amount for selling, general, and administrative expenses based on actual data pertaining to production and sales of the foreign like product by the exporter in question; and
<br>
<br>(C) the cost of all containers and coverings of whatever nature, and all other expenses incidental to placing the foreign like product in condition packed ready for shipment.
<br>
<br>For purposes of subparagraph (A), if the normal value is based on the price of the foreign like product sold for consumption in a country other than the exporting country, the cost of materials shall be determined without regard to any internal tax in the exporting country imposed on such materials or their disposition which are remitted or refunded upon exportation.
<br>(c) Nonmarket economy countries
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>If—
<br>
<br>(A) the subject merchandise is exported from a nonmarket economy country, and
<br>
<br>(B) the administering authority finds that available information does not permit the normal value of the subject merchandise to be determined under subsection (a),
<br>
<br>the administering authority shall determine the normal value of the subject merchandise on the basis of the value of the factors of production utilized in producing the merchandise and to which shall be added an amount for general expenses and profit plus the cost of containers, coverings, and other expenses. Except as provided in paragraph (2), the valuation of the factors of production shall be based on the best available information regarding the values of such factors in a market economy country or countries considered to be appropriate by the administering authority.
<br>(2) Exception
<br>
<br>If the administering authority finds that the available information is inadequate for purposes of determining the normal value of subject merchandise under paragraph (1), the administering authority shall determine the normal value on the basis of the price at which merchandise that is—
<br>
<br>(A) comparable to the subject merchandise, and
<br>
<br>(B) produced in one or more market economy countries that are at a level of economic development comparable to that of the nonmarket economy country,
<br>
<br>is sold in other countries, including the United States.
<br>(3) Factors of production
<br>
<br>For purposes of paragraph (1), the factors of production utilized in producing merchandise include, but are not limited to—
<br>
<br>(A) hours of labor required,
<br>
<br>(B) quantities of raw materials employed,
<br>
<br>(C) amounts of energy and other utilities consumed, and
<br>
<br>(D) representative capital cost, including depreciation.
<br>(4) Valuation of factors of production
<br>
<br>The administering authority, in valuing factors of production under paragraph (1), shall utilize, to the extent possible, the prices or costs of factors of production in one or more market economy countries that are—
<br>
<br>(A) at a level of economic development comparable to that of the nonmarket economy country, and
<br>
<br>(B) significant producers of comparable merchandise.
<br>(5) Discretion to disregard certain price or cost values
<br>
<br>In valuing the factors of production under paragraph (1) for the subject merchandise, the administering authority may disregard price or cost values without further investigation if the administering authority has determined that broadly available export subsidies existed or particular instances of subsidization occurred with respect to those price or cost values or if those price or cost values were subject to an antidumping order.
<br>(d) Special rule for certain multinational corporations
<br>
<br>Whenever, in the course of an investigation under this subtitle, the administering authority determines that—
<br>
<br>(1) subject merchandise exported to the United States is being produced in facilities which are owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by a person, firm, or corporation which also owns or controls, directly or indirectly, other facilities for the production of the foreign like product which are located in another country or countries,
<br>
<br>(2) subsection (a)(1)(C) applies, and
<br>
<br>(3) the normal value of the foreign like product produced in one or more of the facilities outside the exporting country is higher than the normal value of the foreign like product produced in the facilities located in the exporting country,
<br>
<br>it shall determine the normal value of the subject merchandise by reference to the normal value at which the foreign like product is sold in substantial quantities from one or more facilities outside the exporting country. The administering authority, in making any determination under this paragraph, shall make adjustments for the difference between the cost of production (including taxes, labor, materials, and overhead) of the foreign like product produced in facilities outside the exporting country and costs of production of the foreign like product produced in facilities in the exporting country, if such differences are demonstrated to its satisfaction. For purposes of this subsection, in determining the normal value of the foreign like product produced in a country outside of the exporting country, the administering authority shall determine its price at the time of exportation from the exporting country and shall make any adjustments required by subsection (a) for the cost of all containers and coverings and all other costs, charges, and expenses incident to placing the merchandise in condition packed ready for shipment to the United States by reference to such costs in the exporting country.
<br>(e) Constructed value
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subtitle, the constructed value of imported merchandise shall be an amount equal to the sum of—
<br>
<br>(1) the cost of materials and fabrication or other processing of any kind employed in producing the merchandise, during a period which would ordinarily permit the production of the merchandise in the ordinary course of trade;
<br>
<br>(2)(A) the actual amounts incurred and realized by the specific exporter or producer being examined in the investigation or review for selling, general, and administrative expenses, and for profits, in connection with the production and sale of a foreign like product, in the ordinary course of trade, for consumption in the foreign country, or
<br>
<br>(B) if actual data are not available with respect to the amounts described in subparagraph (A), then—
<br>
<br>(i) the actual amounts incurred and realized by the specific exporter or producer being examined in the investigation or review for selling, general, and administrative expenses, and for profits, in connection with the production and sale, for consumption in the foreign country, of merchandise that is in the same general category of products as the subject merchandise,
<br>
<br>(ii) the weighted average of the actual amounts incurred and realized by exporters or producers that are subject to the investigation or review (other than the exporter or producer described in clause (i)) for selling, general, and administrative expenses, and for profits, in connection with the production and sale of a foreign like product, in the ordinary course of trade, for consumption in the foreign country, or
<br>
<br>(iii) the amounts incurred and realized for selling, general, and administrative expenses, and for profits, based on any other reasonable method, except that the amount allowed for profit may not exceed the amount normally realized by exporters or producers (other than the exporter or producer described in clause (i)) in connection with the sale, for consumption in the foreign country, of merchandise that is in the same general category of products as the subject merchandise; and
<br>
<br>(3) the cost of all containers and coverings of whatever nature, and all other expenses incidental to placing the subject merchandise in condition packed ready for shipment to the United States.
<br>
<br>For purposes of paragraph (1), if a particular market situation exists such that the cost of materials and fabrication or other processing of any kind does not accurately reflect the cost of production in the ordinary course of trade, the administering authority may use another calculation methodology under this part or any other calculation methodology. For purposes of paragraph (1), the cost of materials shall be determined without regard to any internal tax in the exporting country imposed on such materials or their disposition that is remitted or refunded upon exportation of the subject merchandise produced from such materials.
<br>(f) Special rules for calculation of cost of production and for calculation of constructed value
<br>
<br>For purposes of subsections (b) and (e).— 1
<br>(1) Costs
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Costs shall normally be calculated based on the records of the exporter or producer of the merchandise, if such records are kept in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles of the exporting country (or the producing country, where appropriate) and reasonably reflect the costs associated with the production and sale of the merchandise. The administering authority shall consider all available evidence on the proper allocation of costs, including that which is made available by the exporter or producer on a timely basis, if such allocations have been historically used by the exporter or producer, in particular for establishing appropriate amortization and depreciation periods, and allowances for capital expenditures and other development costs.
<br>(B) Nonrecurring costs
<br>
<br>Costs shall be adjusted appropriately for those nonrecurring costs that benefit current or future production, or both.
<br>(C) Startup costs
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>Costs shall be adjusted appropriately for circumstances in which costs incurred during the time period covered by the investigation or review are affected by startup operations.
<br>(ii) Startup operations
<br>
<br>Adjustments shall be made for startup operations only where—
<br>
<br>(I) a producer is using new production facilities or producing a new product that requires substantial additional investment, and
<br>
<br>(II) production levels are limited by technical factors associated with the initial phase of commercial production.
<br>
<br> For purposes of subclause (II), the initial phase of commercial production ends at the end of the startup period. In determining whether commercial production levels have been achieved, the administering authority shall consider factors unrelated to startup operations that might affect the volume of production processed, such as demand, seasonality, or business cycles.
<br>(iii) Adjustment for startup operations
<br>
<br>The adjustment for startup operations shall be made by substituting the unit production costs incurred with respect to the merchandise at the end of the startup period for the unit production costs incurred during the startup period. If the startup period extends beyond the period of the investigation or review under this subtitle, the administering authority shall use the most recent cost of production data that it reasonably can obtain, analyze, and verify without delaying the timely completion of the investigation or review. For purposes of this subparagraph, the startup period ends at the point at which the level of commercial production that is characteristic of the merchandise, producer, or industry concerned is achieved.
<br>(2) Transactions disregarded
<br>
<br>A transaction directly or indirectly between affiliated persons may be disregarded if, in the case of any element of value required to be considered, the amount representing that element does not fairly reflect the amount usually reflected in sales of merchandise under consideration in the market under consideration. If a transaction is disregarded under the preceding sentence and no other transactions are available for consideration, the determination of the amount shall be based on the information available as to what the amount would have been if the transaction had occurred between persons who are not affiliated.
<br>(3) Major input rule
<br>
<br>If, in the case of a transaction between affiliated persons involving the production by one of such persons of a major input to the merchandise, the administering authority has reasonable grounds to believe or suspect that an amount represented as the value of such input is less than the cost of production of such input, then the administering authority may determine the value of the major input on the basis of the information available regarding such cost of production, if such cost is greater than the amount that would be determined for such input under paragraph (2).

<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>If the administering authority or the Commission (as the case may be) finds that an interested party has failed to cooperate by not acting to the best of its ability to comply with a request for information from the administering authority or the Commission, the administering authority or the Commission (as the case may be), in reaching the applicable determination under this subtitle—
<br>
<br>(A) may use an inference that is adverse to the interests of that party in selecting from among the facts otherwise available; and
<br>
<br>(B) is not required to determine, or make any adjustments to, a countervailable subsidy rate or weighted average dumping margin based on any assumptions about information the interested party would have provided if the interested party had complied with the request for information.
<br>(2) Potential sources of information for adverse inferences
<br>
<br>An adverse inference under paragraph (1)(A) may include reliance on information derived from—
<br>
<br>(A) the petition,
<br>
<br>(B) a final determination in the investigation under this subtitle,
<br>
<br>(C) any previous review under section 1675 of this title or determination under section 1675b of this title, or

<br>
<br>(A) in the case of a countervailing duty proceeding—
<br>
<br>(i) use a countervailable subsidy rate applied for the same or similar program in a countervailing duty proceeding involving the same country; or
<br>
<br>(ii) if there is no same or similar program, use a countervailable subsidy rate for a subsidy program from a proceeding that the administering authority considers reasonable to use; and
<br>
<br>(B) in the case of an antidumping duty proceeding, use any dumping margin from any segment of the proceeding under the applicable antidumping order.
<br>(2) Discretion to apply highest rate
<br>
<br>In carrying out paragraph (1), the administering authority may apply any of the countervailable subsidy rates or dumping margins specified under that paragraph, including the highest such rate or margin, based on the evaluation by the administering authority of the situation that resulted in the administering authority using an adverse inference in selecting among the facts otherwise available.

<br>
<br>If the administering authority uses an adverse inference under subsection (b)(1)(A) in selecting among the facts otherwise available, the administering authority is not required, for purposes of subsection (c) or for any other purpose—
<br>
<br>(A) to estimate what the countervailable subsidy rate or dumping margin would have been if the interested party found to have failed to cooperate under subsection (b)(1) had cooperated; or
<br>
<br>(B) to demonstrate that the countervailable subsidy rate or dumping margin used by the administering authority reflects an alleged commercial reality of the interested party.

<br>(II) a statement that the information is not susceptible to summary accompanied by a statement of the reasons in support of the contention, and
<br>
<br>(ii) either—
<br>
<br>(I) a statement which permits the administering authority or the Commission to release under administrative protective order, in accordance with subsection (c), the information submitted in confidence, or
<br>
<br>(II) a statement to the administering authority or the Commission that the business proprietary information is of a type that should not be released under administrative protective order.
<br>(2) Unwarranted designation
<br>
<br>If the administering authority of the Commission determines, on the basis of the nature and extent of the information or its availability from public sources, that designation of any information as proprietary is unwarranted, then it shall notify the person who submitted it and ask for an explanation of the reasons for the designation. Unless that person persuades the administering authority or the Commission that the designation is warranted, or withdraws the designation, the administering authority or the Commission, as the case may be, shall return it to the party submitting it. In a case in which the administering authority or the Commission returns the information to the person submitting it, the person may thereafter submit other material concerning the subject matter of the returned information if the submission is made within the time otherwise provided for submitting such material.
<br>(3) Section 1675 reviews
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1), information submitted to the administering authority or the Commission in connection with a review under section 1675(b) or 1675(c) of this title which is designated as proprietary by the person submitting the information may, if the review results in the revocation of an order or finding (or termination of a suspended investigation) under section 1675(d) of this title, be used by the agency to which the information was originally submitted in any investigation initiated within 2 years after the date of the revocation or termination pursuant to a petition covering the same subject merchandise.
<br>(c) Limited disclosure of certain proprietary information under protective order
<br>(1) Disclosure by administering authority or Commission
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Upon receipt of an application (before or after receipt of the information requested) which describes in general terms the information requested and sets forth the reasons for the request, the administering authority or the Commission shall make all business proprietary information presented to, or obtained by it, during a proceeding (except privileged information, classified information, and specific information of a type for which there is a clear and compelling need to withhold from disclosure) available to interested parties who are parties to the proceeding under a protective order described in subparagraph (B), regardless of when the information is submitted during a proceeding. Customer names obtained during any investigation which requires a determination under section 1671d(b) or 1673d(b) of this title may not be disclosed by the administering authority under protective order until either an order is published under section 1671e(a) or 1673e(a) of this title as a result of the investigation or the investigation is suspended or terminated. The Commission may delay disclosure of customer names under protective order during any such investigation until a reasonable time prior to any hearing provided under section 1677c of this title.
<br>(B) Protective order
<br>
<br>The protective order under which information is made available shall contain such requirements as the administering authority or the Commission may determine by regulation to be appropriate. The administering authority and the Commission shall provide by regulation for such sanctions as the administering authority and the Commission determine to be appropriate, including disbarment from practice before the agency.
<br>(C) Time limitation on determinations
<br>
<br>The administering authority or the Commission, as the case may be, shall determine whether to make information available under this paragraph—
<br>
<br>(i) not later than 14 days (7 days if the submission pertains to a proceeding under section 1671b(a) or 1673b(a) of this title) after the date on which the information is submitted, or
<br>
<br>(ii) if—
<br>
<br>(I) the person that submitted the information raises objection to its release, or
<br>
<br>(II) the information is unusually voluminous or complex,
<br>
<br> not later than 30 days (10 days if the submission pertains to a proceeding under section 1671b(a) or 1673b(a) of this title) after the date on which the information is submitted.
<br>(D) Availability after determination
<br>
<br>If the determination under subparagraph (C) is affirmative, then—
<br>
<br>(i) the business proprietary information submitted to the administering authority or the Commission on or before the date of the determination shall be made available, subject to the terms and conditions of the protective order, on such date; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the business proprietary information submitted to the administering authority or the Commission after the date of the determination shall be served as required by subsection (d).
<br>(E) Failure to disclose
<br>
<br>If a person submitting information to the administering authority refuses to disclose business proprietary information which the administering authority determines should be released under a protective order described in subparagraph (B), the administering authority shall return the information, and any nonconfidential summary thereof, to the person submitting the information and summary and shall not consider either.
<br>(2) Disclosure under court order
<br>
<br>If the administering authority denies a request for information under paragraph (1), then application may be made to the United States Customs Court for an order directing the administering authority or the Commission to make the information available. After notification of all parties to the investigation and after an opportunity for a hearing on the record, the court may issue an order, under such conditions as the court deems appropriate, which shall not have the effect of stopping or suspending the investigation, directing the administering authority or the Commission to make all or a portion of the requested information described in the preceding sentence available under a protective order and setting forth sanctions for violation of such order if the court finds that, under the standards applicable in proceedings of the court, such an order is warranted, and that—
<br>
<br>(A) the administering authority or the Commission has denied access to the information under subsection (b)(1),
<br>
<br>(B) the person on whose behalf the information is requested is an interested party who is a party to the investigation in connection with which the information was obtained or developed, and
<br>
<br>(C) the party which submitted the information to which the request relates has been notified, in advance of the hearing, of the request made under this section and of its right to appear and be heard.
<br>(d) Service
<br>
<br>Any party submitting written information, including business proprietary information, to the administering authority or the Commission during a proceeding shall, at the same time, serve the information upon all interested parties who are parties to the proceeding, if the information is covered by a protective order. The administering authority or the Commission shall not accept any such information that is not accompanied by a certificate of service and a copy of the protective order version of the document containing the information. Business proprietary information shall only be served upon interested parties who are parties to the proceeding that are subject to protective order; however, a nonconfidential summary thereof shall be served upon all other interested parties who are parties to the proceeding.
<br>(e) Repealed. Pub. L. 103–465, title II, §231(d)(1), Dec. 8, 1994, 108 Stat. 4897
<br>(f) Disclosure of proprietary information under protective orders issued pursuant to the United States-Canada Agreement or the USMCA
<br>(1) Issuance of protective orders
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>If binational panel review of a determination under this subtitle is requested pursuant to article 1904 of the United States-Canada Agreement or article 10.12 of the USMCA, or an extraordinary challenge committee is convened under Annex 1904.13 of the United States-Canada Agreement or chapter 10 of the USMCA, the administering authority or the Commission, as appropriate, may make available to authorized persons, under a protective order described in paragraph (2), a copy of all proprietary material in the administrative record made during the proceeding in question. If the administering authority or the Commission claims a privilege as to a document or portion of a document in the administrative record of the proceeding in question and a binational panel or extraordinary challenge committee finds that in camera inspection or limited disclosure of that document or portion thereof is required by United States law, the administering authority or the Commission, as appropriate, may restrict access to such document or portion thereof to the authorized persons identified by the panel or committee as requiring access and may require such persons to obtain access under a protective order described in paragraph (2).
<br>(B) Authorized persons
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subsection, the term "authorized persons" means—
<br>
<br>(i) the members of, and the appropriate staff of, the binational panel or the extraordinary challenge committee, as the case may be, and the Secretariat,
<br>
<br>(ii) counsel for parties to such panel or committee proceeding, and employees, and persons under the direction and control, of such counsel,
<br>
<br>(iii) any officer or employee of the United States Government designated by the administering authority or the Commission, as appropriate, to whom disclosure is necessary in order to make recommendations to the Trade Representative regarding the convening of extraordinary challenge committees under chapter 19 of the Agreement or chapter 10 of the USMCA, and
<br>
<br>(iv) any officer or employee of the Government of a free trade area country (as defined in section 1516a(f)(9) of this title) designated by an authorized agency of such country to whom disclosure is necessary in order to make decisions regarding the convening of extraordinary challenge committees under chapter 19 of the Agreement or chapter 10 of the USMCA.
<br>(C) Review
<br>
<br>A decision concerning the disclosure or nondisclosure of material under protective order by the administering authority or the Commission shall not be subject to judicial review, and no court of the United States shall have power or jurisdiction to review such decision on any question of law or fact by an action in the nature of mandamus or otherwise.
<br>(2) Contents of protective order
<br>
<br>Each protective order issued under this subsection shall be in such form and contain such requirements as the administering authority or the Commission may determine by regulation to be appropriate. The administering authority and the Commission shall ensure that regulations issued pursuant to this paragraph shall be designed to provide an opportunity for participation in the binational panel proceeding, including any extraordinary challenge, equivalent to that available for judicial review of determinations by the administering authority or the Commission that are not subject to review by a binational panel.
<br>(3) Prohibited acts
<br>
<br>It is unlawful for any person to violate, to induce the violation of, or knowingly to receive information the receipt of which constitutes a violation of, any provision of a protective order issued under this subsection or to violate, to induce the violation of, or knowingly to receive information the receipt of which constitutes a violation of, any provision of an undertaking entered into with an authorized agency of a free trade area country (as defined in section 1516a(f)(9) of this title) to protect proprietary material during binational panel or extraordinary challenge committee review pursuant to article 1904 of article 1904 of 1 the United States-Canada Agreement or article 10.12 of the USMCA.
<br>(4) Sanctions for violation of protective orders
<br>
<br>Any person, except a judge appointed to a binational panel or an extraordinary challenge committee under section 4582(b) of this title, who is found by the administering authority or the Commission, as appropriate, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with section 554 of title 5 to have committed an act prohibited by paragraph (3) shall be liable to the United States for a civil penalty and shall be subject to such other administrative sanctions, including, but not limited to, debarment from practice before the administering authority or the Commission, as the administering authority or the Commission determines to be appropriate. The amount of the civil penalty shall not exceed $100,000 for each violation. Each day of a continuing violation shall constitute a separate violation. The amount of such civil penalty and other sanctions shall be assessed by the administering authority or the Commission by written notice, except that assessment shall be made by the administering authority for violation, inducement of a violation or receipt of information with reason to know that such information was disclosed in violation, of an undertaking entered into by any person with an authorized agency of a free trade area country (as defined in section 1516a(f)(9) of this title).
<br>(5) Review of sanctions
<br>
<br>Any person against whom sanctions are imposed under paragraph (4) may obtain review of such sanctions by filing a notice of appeal in the United States Court of International Trade within 30 days from the date of the order imposing the sanction and by simultaneously sending a copy of such notice by certified mail to the administering authority or the Commission, as appropriate. The administering authority or the Commission shall promptly file in such court a certified copy of the record upon which such violation was found or such sanction imposed, as provided in section 2112 of title 28. The findings and order of the administering authority or the Commission shall be set aside by the court only if the court finds that such findings and order are not supported by substantial evidence, as provided in section 706(2) of title 5.
<br>(6) Enforcement of sanctions
<br>
<br>If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty or to comply with other administrative sanctions after the order imposing such sanctions becomes a final and unappealable order, or after the United States Court of International Trade has entered final judgment in favor of the administering authority or the Commission, an action may be filed in such court to enforce the sanctions. In such action, the validity and appropriateness of the final order imposing the sanctions shall not be subject to review.
<br>(7) Testimony and production of papers
<br>(A) Authority to obtain information
<br>
<br>For the purpose of conducting any hearing and carrying out other functions and duties under this subsection, the administering authority and the Commission, or their duly authorized agents—
<br>
<br>(i) shall have access to and the right to copy any pertinent document, paper, or record in the possession of any individual, partnership, corporation, association, organization, or other entity,
<br>

In the case of disobedience to a subpoena issued under subparagraph (A), an action may be filed in any district or territorial court of the United States to require the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of documentary evidence. Such court, within the jurisdiction of which such inquiry is carried on, may, in case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena issued to any individual, partnership, corporation, association, organization or other entity, issue any order requiring such individual or entity to appear before the administering authority or the Commission, or to produce documentary evidence if so ordered or to give evidence concerning the matter in question. Any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by the court as a contempt thereof.
<br>(C) Mandamus
<br>
<br>Any court referred to in subparagraph (B) shall have jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus commanding compliance with the provisions of this subsection or any order of the administering authority or the Commission made in pursuance thereof.
<br>(D) Depositions
<br>
<br>For purposes of carrying out any functions or duties under this subsection, the administering authority or the Commission may order testimony to be taken by deposition. Such deposition may be taken before any person designated by the administering authority or Commission and having power to administer oaths. Such testimony shall be reduced to writing by the person taking the deposition, or under the direction of such person, and shall then be subscribed by the deponent. Any individual, partnership, corporation, association, organization or other entity may be compelled to appear and depose and to produce documentary evidence in the same manner as witnesses may be compelled to appear and testify and produce documentary evidence before the administering authority or Commission, as provided in this paragraph.
<br>(E) Fees and mileage of witnesses
<br>
<br>Witnesses summoned before the administering authority or the Commission shall be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid witnesses in the courts of the United States.

<br>
<br>The administering authority and the Commission may withhold from disclosure any correspondence, private letters of reprimand, settlement agreements, and documents and files compiled in relation to investigations and actions involving a violation or possible violation of a protective order issued under subsection (c) or (d), and such information shall be treated as information described in section 552(b)(3) of title 5.
<br>(h) Opportunity for comment by consumers and industrial users
<br>
<br>The administering authority and the Commission shall provide an opportunity for industrial users of the subject merchandise and, if the merchandise is sold at the retail level, for representative consumer organizations, to submit relevant information to the administering authority concerning dumping or a countervailable subsidy, and to the Commission concerning material injury by reason of dumped or subsidized imports.
