<br>Countering Iran in the Western Hemisphere
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 112–220, Dec. 28, 2012, 126 Stat. 1596, provided that:
<br>"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
<br>
<br>"This Act may be cited as the 'Countering Iran in the Western Hemisphere Act of 2012'.
<br>"SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
<br>
<br>"Congress finds the following:
<br>
<br>"(1) The United States has vital political, economic, and security interests in the Western Hemisphere.
<br>
<br>"(2) Iran is pursuing cooperation with Latin American countries by signing economic and security agreements in order to create a network of diplomatic and economic relationships to lessen the blow of international sanctions and oppose Western attempts to constrict its ambitions.
<br>
<br>"(3) According to the Department of State, Hezbollah, with Iran as its state sponsor, is considered the 'most technically capable terrorist group in the world' with 'thousands of supporters, several thousand members, and a few hundred terrorist operatives,' and officials from the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Qods Force have been working in concert with Hezbollah for many years.
<br>
<br>"(4) The IRGC's Qods Force has a long history of supporting Hezbollah's military, paramilitary, and terrorist activities, providing it with guidance, funding, weapons, intelligence, and logistical support, and in 2007, the Department of the Treasury placed sanctions on the IRGC and its Qods Force for their support of terrorism and proliferation activities.
<br>
<br>"(5) The IRGC's Qods Force stations operatives in foreign embassies, charities, and religious and cultural institutions to foster relationships, often building on existing socioeconomic ties with the well established Shia Diaspora, and recent years have witnessed an increased presence in Latin America.
<br>
<br>"(6) According to the Department of Defense, the IRGC and its Qods Force played a significant role in some of the deadliest terrorist attacks of the past two decades, including the 1994 attack on the AMIA Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires, by generally directing or supporting the groups that actually executed the attacks.
<br>
<br>"(7) Reports of Iranian intelligence agents being implicated in Hezbollah-linked activities since the early 1990s suggest direct Iranian government support of Hezbollah activities in the Tri-Border Area of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay, and in the past decade, Iran has dramatically increased its diplomatic missions to Venezuela, Bolivia, Nicaragua, Ecuador, Argentina, and Brazil. Iran has built 17 cultural centers in Latin America, and it currently maintains 11 embassies, up from 6 in 2005.
<br>
<br>"(8) Hezbollah and other Iranian proxies with a presence in Latin America have raised revenues through illicit activities, including drug and arms trafficking, counterfeiting, money laundering, forging travel documents, pirating software and music, and providing haven and assistance to other terrorists transiting the region.
<br>
<br>"(9) Bolivia, Cuba, Ecuador, Nicaragua, and Venezuela expressed their intention to assist Iran in evading sanctions by signing a statement supporting Iran's nuclear activities and announcing at a 2010 joint press conference in Tehran their determination to 'continue and expand their economic ties to Iran' with confidence that 'Iran can give a crushing response to the threats and sanctions imposed by the West and imperialism'.
<br>
<br>"(10) The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration concluded in 2008 that almost one-half of the foreign terrorist organizations in the world are linked to narcotics trade and trafficking, including Hezbollah and Hamas.
<br>
<br>"(11) In October 2011, the United States charged two men, Manssor Arbabsiar, a United States citizen holding both Iranian and United States passports, and Gholam Shakuri, an Iran-based member of Iran's IRGC Qods Force, with conspiracy to murder a foreign official using explosives in an act of terrorism. Arbabsiar traveled to Mexico with the express intent to hire 'someone in the narcotics business' to carry out the assassination of the Saudi Arabian Ambassador in the United States. While in the end, he only engaged a U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency informant posing as an associate of a drug trafficking cartel, Arbabsiar believed that he was working with a member of a Mexican drug trafficking organization and sought to send money to this individual in installments and not in a single transfer.
<br>
<br>"(12) In February 2011, actions by the Department of the Treasury effectively shut down the Lebanese Canadian Bank. Subsequent actions by the United States Government in connection with the investigation into Lebanese Canadian Bank resulted in the indictment in December 2011 of Ayman Joumaa, an individual of Lebanese nationality, with citizenship in Lebanon and Colombia, and with ties to Hezbollah, for trafficking cocaine to the Los Zetas drug trafficking organization in Mexico City for sale in the United States and for laundering the proceeds.
<br>"SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.
<br>
<br>"It shall be the policy of the United States to use a comprehensive government-wide strategy to counter Iran's growing hostile presence and activity in the Western Hemisphere by working together with United States allies and partners in the region to mutually deter threats to United States interests by the Government of Iran, the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the IRGC's Qods Force, and Hezbollah.
<br>"SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.
<br>
<br>"In this Act:
<br>
<br>"(1) Western hemisphere.—The term 'Western Hemisphere' means the United States, Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, South America, and Central America.
<br>
<br>"(2) Relevant congressional committees.—The term 'relevant congressional committees' means the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate.
<br>"SEC. 5. REQUIREMENT OF A STRATEGY TO ADDRESS IRAN'S GROWING HOSTILE PRESENCE AND ACTIVITY IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE.

<br>
<br>"(6) a description of activity by Iran, the IRGC, its Qods Force, Hezbollah, and other terrorist organizations linked to Iran that may be present at the United States borders with Mexico and Canada and at other international borders within the Western Hemisphere, including operations related to drug, human, and arms trafficking, human support networks, financial support, narco-tunneling, and technological advancements that incorporates—
<br>

<br>SUBCHAPTER I—EXPANSION OF MULTILATERAL SANCTIONS REGIME WITH RESPECT TO IRAN
<br>§8711. Sense of Congress on enforcement of multilateral sanctions regime and expansion and implementation of sanctions laws
<br>
<br>It is the sense of Congress that the goal of compelling Iran to abandon efforts to acquire a nuclear weapons capability and other threatening activities can be effectively achieved through a comprehensive policy that includes economic sanctions, diplomacy, and military planning, capabilities and options, and that this objective is consistent with the one stated by President Barack Obama in the 2012 State of the Union Address: "Let there be no doubt: America is determined to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and I will take no options off the table to achieve that goal". Among the economic measures to be taken are—
<br>
<br>(1) prompt enforcement of the current multilateral sanctions regime with respect to Iran;
<br>
<br>(2) full, timely, and vigorous implementation of all sanctions enacted into law, including sanctions imposed or expanded by this Act or amendments made by this Act, through—
<br>
<br>(A) intensified monitoring by the President and the designees of the President, including the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of State, and senior officials in the intelligence community (as defined in section 401a(4) of title 50), as appropriate;
<br>
<br>(B) more extensive use of extraordinary authorities provided for under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) and other sanctions laws;
<br>
<br>(C) reallocation of resources to provide the personnel necessary, within the Department of the Treasury, the Department of State, and the Department of Commerce, and, where appropriate, the intelligence community, to apply and enforce sanctions; and
<br>
<br>(D) expanded cooperation with international sanctions enforcement efforts;
<br>
<br>(3) urgent consideration of the expansion of existing sanctions with respect to such areas as—
<br>
<br>(A) the provision of energy-related services to Iran;
<br>
<br>(B) the provision of insurance and reinsurance services to Iran;
<br>
<br>(C) the provision of shipping services to Iran; and
<br>
<br>(D) those Iranian financial institutions not yet designated for the imposition of sanctions that may be acting as intermediaries for Iranian financial institutions that are designated for the imposition of sanctions; and
<br>
<br>(4) a focus on countering Iran's efforts to evade sanctions, including—
<br>
<br>(A) the activities of telecommunications, Internet, and satellite service providers, in and outside of Iran, to ensure that such providers are not participating in or facilitating, directly or indirectly, the evasion of the sanctions regime with respect to Iran or violations of the human rights of the people of Iran;
<br>
<br>(B) the activities of financial institutions or other businesses or government agencies, in or outside of Iran, not yet designated for the imposition of sanctions; and
<br>
<br>(C) urgent and ongoing evaluation of Iran's energy, national security, financial, and telecommunications sectors, to gauge the effects of, and possible defects in, particular sanctions, with prompt efforts to correct any gaps in the existing sanctions regime with respect to Iran.

<br>(1) providers of specialized financial messaging services are a critical link to the international financial system;

<br>(3) the loss of access by sanctioned Iranian financial institutions to specialized financial messaging services must be maintained.

<br>
<br>(A) the person is subject to a sanctions regime under its governing foreign law that requires it to eliminate the knowing provision of such messaging services to, and the knowing enabling and facilitation of direct or indirect access to such messaging services for—
<br>
<br>(i) the Central Bank of Iran; and
<br>
<br>(ii) a group of Iranian financial institutions identified under such governing foreign law for purposes of that sanctions regime if the President determines that—
<br>
<br>(I) the group is substantially similar to the group of financial institutions described in section 104(c)(2)(E)(ii) of the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 (22 U.S.C. 8513(c)(2)(E)(ii)); and
