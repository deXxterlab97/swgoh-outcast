<br>§1064. Cancellation of registration
<br>
<br>A petition to cancel a registration of a mark, stating the grounds relied upon, may, upon payment of the prescribed fee, be filed as follows by any person who believes that he is or will be damaged, including as a result of a likelihood of dilution by blurring or dilution by tarnishment under section 1125(c) of this title, by the registration of a mark on the principal register established by this chapter, or under the Act of March 3, 1881, or the Act of February 20, 1905:
<br>
<br>(1) Within five years from the date of the registration of the mark under this chapter.
<br>
<br>(2) Within five years from the date of publication under section 1062(c) of this title of a mark registered under the Act of March 3, 1881, or the Act of February 20, 1905.
<br>
<br>(3) At any time if the registered mark becomes the generic name for the goods or services, or a portion thereof, for which it is registered, or is functional, or has been abandoned, or its registration was obtained fraudulently or contrary to the provisions of section 1054 of this title or of subsection (a), (b), or (c) of section 1052 of this title for a registration under this chapter, or contrary to similar prohibitory provisions of such prior Acts for a registration under such Acts, or if the registered mark is being used by, or with the permission of, the registrant so as to misrepresent the source of the goods or services on or in connection with which the mark is used. If the registered mark becomes the generic name for less than all of the goods or services for which it is registered, a petition to cancel the registration for only those goods or services may be filed. A registered mark shall not be deemed to be the generic name of goods or services solely because such mark is also used as a name of or to identify a unique product or service. The primary significance of the registered mark to the relevant public rather than purchaser motivation shall be the test for determining whether the registered mark has become the generic name of goods or services on or in connection with which it has been used.
<br>
<br>(4) At any time if the mark is registered under the Act of March 3, 1881, or the Act of February 20, 1905, and has not been published under the provisions of subsection (c) of section 1062 of this title.
<br>
<br>(5) At any time in the case of a certification mark on the ground that the registrant (A) does not control, or is not able legitimately to exercise control over, the use of such mark, or (B) engages in the production or marketing of any goods or services to which the certification mark is applied, or (C) permits the use of the certification mark for purposes other than to certify, or (D) discriminately refuses to certify or to continue to certify the goods or services of any person who maintains the standards or conditions which such mark certifies:
<br>
<br>Provided, That the Federal Trade Commission may apply to cancel on the grounds specified in paragraphs (3) and (5) of this section any mark registered on the principal register established by this chapter, and the prescribed fee shall not be required. Nothing in paragraph (5) shall be deemed to prohibit the registrant from using its certification mark in advertising or promoting recognition of the certification program or of the goods or services meeting the certification standards of the registrant. Such uses of the certification mark shall not be grounds for cancellation under paragraph (5), so long as the registrant does not itself produce, manufacture, or sell any of the certified goods or services to which its identical certification mark is applied.

<br>
<br>(1) by striking the colon at the end of paragraph (5) and inserting a period;

<br>(3) in the flush text following paragraph (6), as added, by inserting "Nothing in paragraph (6) shall be construed to limit the timing applicable to any other ground for cancellation.

<br>§1066a. Ex parte expungement
<br>(a) Petition
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding sections 1057(b) and 1072 of this title, and subsections (a) and (b) of section 1115 of this title, any person may file a petition to expunge a registration of a mark on the basis that the mark has never been used in commerce on or in connection with some or all of the goods or services recited in the registration.
<br>(b) Contents of petition
<br>
<br>A petition filed under subsection (a), together with any supporting documents, shall—
<br>
<br>(1) identify the registration that is the subject of the petition;
<br>
<br>(2) identify each good or service recited in the registration for which it is alleged that the mark has never been used in commerce;
<br>
<br>(3) include a verified statement that sets forth—
<br>
<br>(A) the elements of the reasonable investigation the petitioner conducted to determine that the mark has never been used in commerce on or in connection with the goods and services identified in the petition; and
<br>
<br>(B) any additional facts that support the allegation that the mark has never been used in commerce on or in connection with the identified goods and services;
<br>
<br>(4) include any supporting evidence on which the petitioner relies; and
<br>
<br>(5) be accompanied by the fee prescribed by the Director.
<br>
<br>(c) Initial determination; institution
<br>(1) Prima facie case determination, institution, and notification
<br>
<br>The Director shall, for each good or service identified under subsection (b)(2), determine whether the petition sets forth a prima facie case of the mark having never been used in commerce on or in connection with each such good or service, institute an ex parte expungement proceeding for each good or service for which the Director determines that a prima facie case has been set forth, and provide a notice to the registrant and petitioner of the determination of whether or not the proceeding was instituted. Such notice shall include a copy of the petition and any supporting documents and evidence that were included with the petition.
<br>(2) Reasonable investigation guidance
<br>
<br>The Director shall promulgate regulations regarding what constitutes a reasonable investigation under subsection (b)(3) and the general types of evidence that could support a prima facie case that a mark has never been used in commerce, but the Director shall retain the discretion to determine whether a prima facie case is set out in a particular proceeding.
<br>(3) Determination by Director
<br>
<br>Any determination by the Director whether or not to institute a proceeding under this section shall be final and non-reviewable, and shall not prejudice any party's right to raise any issue and rely on any evidence in any other proceeding, except as provided in subsection (j).
<br>(d) Ex parte expungement procedures
<br>
<br>The procedures for ex parte expungement shall be the same as the procedures for examination under section 1062(b) of this title, except that the Director shall promulgate regulations establishing and governing a proceeding under this section, which may include regulations that—
<br>
<br>(1) set response and extension times particular to this type of proceeding, which, notwithstanding section 1062(b)(3) of this title, need not be extendable to 6 months;
<br>
<br>(2) set limits governing the timing and number of petitions filed for a particular registration or by a particular petitioner or real parties in interest; and
<br>
<br>(3) define the relation of a proceeding under this section to other proceedings concerning the mark.
<br>(e) Registrant's evidence of use
<br>
<br>A registrant's documentary evidence of use shall be consistent with when a mark shall be deemed to be in use in commerce under the definition of "use in commerce" in section 1127 of this title, but shall not be limited in form to that of specimens as provided in section 1051(a) of this title.
<br>(f) Excusable nonuse
<br>
<br>During an ex parte expungement proceeding, for a mark registered under section 1126(e) of this title or an extension of protection under section 1141f of this title, the registrant may offer evidence showing that any nonuse is due to special circumstances that excuse such nonuse. In such a case, the examiner shall determine whether the facts and evidence demonstrate excusable nonuse and shall not find that the registration should be cancelled under subsection (g) for any good or service for which excusable nonuse is demonstrated.
<br>(g) Examiner's decision; order to cancel
<br>
<br>For each good or service for which it is determined that a mark has never been used in commerce, and for which the provisions of subsection (f) do not apply, the examiner shall find that the registration should be cancelled for each such good or service. A mark shall not be found to have never been used in commerce if there is evidence of use in commerce by the registrant that temporally would have supported registration at the time the application was filed or the relevant allegation of use was made, or after registration, but before the petition to expunge was filed under subsection (a), or an ex parte expungement proceeding was instituted by the Director under subsection (h). Unless overturned on review of the examiner's decision, the Director shall issue an order cancelling the registration, in whole or in part, after the time for appeal has expired or any appeal proceeding has terminated.
<br>(h) Ex parte expungement by the Director
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Director may, on the Director's own initiative, institute an ex parte expungement proceeding if the Director discovers information that supports a prima facie case of a mark having never been used in commerce on or in connection with any good or service covered by a registration. The Director shall promptly notify the registrant of such determination, at which time the ex parte expungement proceeding shall proceed according to the same procedures for ex parte expungement established pursuant to subsection (d). If the Director determines, based on the Director's own initiative, to institute an expungement proceeding, the Director shall transmit or make available the information that formed the basis for that determination as part of the institution notice sent to the registrant.
<br>(2) Rule of construction
<br>
<br>Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit any other authority of the Director.
<br>(i) Time for institution
<br>(1) When petition may be filed, ex parte expungement proceeding instituted
<br>
<br>A petition for ex parte expungement of a registration under subsection (a) may be filed, or the Director may institute on the Director's own initiative an ex parte expungement proceeding of a registration under subsection (h), at any time following the expiration of 3 years after the date of registration and before the expiration of 10 years following the date of registration.
<br>(2) Exception
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding paragraph (1), for a period of 3 years after December 27, 2020, a petition for expungement of a registration under subsection (a) may be filed, or the Director may institute on the Director's own initiative an ex parte expungement proceeding of a registration under subsection (h), at any time following the expiration of 3 years after the date of registration.
<br>(j) Limitation on later ex parte expungement proceedings
<br>(1) No co-pending proceedings
<br>
<br>With respect to a particular registration, while an ex parte expungement proceeding is pending, no later ex parte expungement proceeding may be instituted with respect to the same goods or services that are the subject of a pending ex parte expungement proceeding.
<br>(2) Estoppel
<br>
<br>With respect to a particular registration, for goods or services previously subject to an instituted expungement proceeding for which, in that proceeding, it was determined that the registrant had used the mark for particular goods or services, as relevant, and the registration was not cancelled as to those goods or services, no further ex parte expungement proceedings may be initiated as to those goods or services, regardless of the identity of the petitioner.
<br>(k) Use in commerce requirement not altered
<br>
<br>Nothing in this section shall affect the requirement for use in commerce of a mark registered under section 1051(a) or 1091 of this title.

<br>(3) Determination by Director
<br>
<br>Any determination by the Director whether or not to institute a reexamination proceeding under this section shall be final and non-reviewable, and shall not prejudice any party's right to raise any issue and rely on any evidence in any other proceeding, except as provided in subsection (j).

<br>
<br>The procedures for reexamination shall be the same as the procedures established under section 1062(b) of this title except that the Director shall promulgate regulations establishing and governing a proceeding under this section, which may include regulations that—

<br>§1071. Appeal to courts
<br>(a) Persons entitled to appeal; United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit; waiver of civil action; election of civil action by adverse party; procedure
<br>
<br>(1) An applicant for registration of a mark, party to an interference proceeding, party to an opposition proceeding, party to an application to register as a lawful concurrent user, party to a cancellation proceeding, a registrant who has filed an affidavit as provided in section 1058 of this title or section 1141k of this title, or an applicant for renewal, who is dissatisfied with the decision of the Director or Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, may appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit thereby waiving his right to proceed under subsection (b) of this section: Provided, That such appeal shall be dismissed if any adverse party to the proceeding, other than the Director, shall, within twenty days after the appellant has filed notice of appeal according to paragraph (2) of this subsection, files notice with the Director that he elects to have all further proceedings conducted as provided in subsection (b) of this section. Thereupon the appellant shall have thirty days thereafter within which to file a civil action under subsection (b) of this section, in default of which the decision appealed from shall govern the further proceedings in the case.
<br>
<br>(2) When an appeal is taken to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the appellant shall file in the United States Patent and Trademark Office a written notice of appeal directed to the Director, within such time after the date of the decision from which the appeal is taken as the Director prescribes, but in no case less than 60 days after that date.
<br>
<br>(3) The Director shall transmit to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit a certified list of the documents comprising the record in the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The court may request that the Director forward the original or certified copies of such documents during pendency of the appeal. In an ex parte case, the Director shall submit to that court a brief explaining the grounds for the decision of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, addressing all the issues involved in the appeal. The court shall, before hearing an appeal, give notice of the time and place of the hearing to the Director and the parties in the appeal.
<br>
<br>(4) The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit shall review the decision from which the appeal is taken on the record before the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Upon its determination the court shall issue its mandate and opinion to the Director, which shall be entered of record in the United States Patent and Trademark Office and shall govern the further proceedings in the case. However, no final judgment shall be entered in favor of an applicant under section 1051(b) of this title before the mark is registered, if such applicant cannot prevail without establishing constructive use pursuant to section 1057(c) of this title.
<br>(b) Civil action; persons entitled to; jurisdiction of court; status of Director; procedure
<br>
<br>(1) Whenever a person authorized by subsection (a) of this section to appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is dissatisfied with the decision of the Director or Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, said person may, unless appeal has been taken to said United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, have remedy by a civil action if commenced within such time after such decision, not less than sixty days, as the Director appoints or as provided in subsection (a) of this section. The court may adjudge that an applicant is entitled to a registration upon the application involved, that a registration involved should be canceled, or such other matter as the issues in the proceeding require, as the facts in the case may appear. Such adjudication shall authorize the Director to take any necessary action, upon compliance with the requirements of law. However, no final judgment shall be entered in favor of an applicant under section 1051(b) of this title before the mark is registered, if such applicant cannot prevail without establishing constructive use pursuant to section 1057(c) of this title.
<br>
<br>(2) The Director shall not be made a party to an inter partes proceeding under this subsection, but he shall be notified of the filing of the complaint by the clerk of the court in which it is filed and shall have the right to intervene in the action.
<br>
<br>(3) In any case where there is no adverse party, a copy of the complaint shall be served on the Director, and, unless the court finds the expenses to be unreasonable, all the expenses of the proceeding shall be paid by the party bringing the case, whether the final decision is in favor of such party or not. In suits brought hereunder, the record in the United States Patent and Trademark Office shall be admitted on motion of any party, upon such terms and conditions as to costs, expenses, and the further cross-examination of the witnesses as the court imposes, without prejudice to the right of any party to take further testimony. The testimony and exhibits of the record in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, when admitted, shall have the same effect as if originally taken and produced in the suit.
<br>
<br>(4) Where there is an adverse party, such suit may be instituted against the party in interest as shown by the records of the United States Patent and Trademark Office at the time of the decision complained of, but any party in interest may become a party to the action. If there are adverse parties residing in a plurality of districts not embraced within the same State, or an adverse party residing in a foreign country, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia shall have jurisdiction and may issue summons against the adverse parties directed to the marshal of any district in which any adverse party resides. Summons against adverse parties residing in foreign countries may be served by publication or otherwise as the court directs.
