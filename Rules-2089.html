<br>
<br>Section 11105 provides that when a United States vessel is sold in a foreign port, the seamen must be provided employment on another vessel, or passage to the port of original shipment.
<br>§11106. Wages on justifiable complaint of seamen
<br>
<br>(a) Before a seaman on a vessel of the United States is discharged in a foreign country by a consular officer on the seaman's complaint that the agreement required by this part has been breached because the vessel is badly provisioned or unseaworthy, or against the officers for cruel treatment, the officer shall inquire about the complaint. If satisfied of the justice of the complaint, the consular officer shall require the master to pay the wages due the seaman plus one month's additional wages and shall discharge the seaman. The master shall provide the seaman with employment on another vessel or provide the seaman with passage on another vessel to the port of original engagement, to the most convenient port of the United States, or to some port agreeable to the seaman.
<br>
<br>(b) When a vessel does not have sufficient provisions for the intended voyage, and the seaman has been forced to accept a reduced ration or provisions that are bad in quality or unfit for use, the seaman is entitled to recover from the master or owner an allowance, as additional wages, that the court hearing the case considers reasonable.
<br>
<br>(c) Subsection (b) of this section does not apply when the reduction in rations was for a period during which the seaman willfully and without sufficient cause failed to perform duties or was lawfully under confinement on board or on shore for misconduct, unless that reduction can be shown to have been unreasonable.
<br>
<br>(d) Subsection (b) of this section does not apply to a fishing or whaling vessel or a yacht.

<br>§11107. Unlawful engagements void
<br>
<br>An engagement of a seaman contrary to a law of the United States is void.

<br>
<br>(b) Liability.—
<br>
<br>(1) Limitation on jurisdiction to tax.—An individual to whom this subsection applies is not subject to the income tax laws of a State or political subdivision of a State, other than the State and political subdivision in which the individual resides, with respect to compensation for the performance of duties described in paragraph (2).
<br>
<br>(2) Application.—This subsection applies to an individual—
<br>
<br>(A) engaged on a vessel to perform assigned duties in more than one State as a pilot licensed under section 7101 of this title or licensed or authorized under the laws of a State; or
<br>
<br>(B) who performs regularly assigned duties while engaged as a master, officer, or crewman on a vessel operating on navigable waters in 2 or more States.

<br>§12111. Registry endorsement
<br>
<br>(a) Requirements.—A registry endorsement may be issued for a vessel that satisfies the requirements of section 12103 of this title.

<br>
<br>(c) Certain Vessels Owned by Trusts.—
<br>
<br>(1) Nonapplication of beneficiary citizenship requirement.—For the issuance of a certificate of documentation with only a registry endorsement, the beneficiaries of a trust are not required to be citizens of the United States if the trust qualifies under paragraph (2) and the vessel is subject to a charter to a citizen of the United States.
<br>
<br>(2) Requirements for trust to qualify.—
<br>
<br>(A) In general.—Subject to subparagraph (B), a trust qualifies under this paragraph with respect to a vessel only if—
<br>
<br>(i) each trustee is a citizen of the United States; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the application for documentation of the vessel includes the affidavit of each trustee stating that the trustee is not aware of any reason involving a beneficiary of the trust that is not a citizen of the United States, or involving any other person that is not a citizen of the United States, as a result of which the beneficiary or other person would hold more than 25 percent of the aggregate power to influence or limit the exercise of the authority of the trustee with respect to matters involving any ownership or operation of the vessel that may adversely affect the interests of the United States.
<br>
<br>(B) Authority of non-citizens.—If any person that is not a citizen of the United States has authority to direct or participate in directing a trustee for a trust in matters involving any ownership or operation of the vessel that may adversely affect the interests of the United States or in removing a trustee for a trust without cause, either directly or indirectly through the control of another person, the trust is not qualified under this paragraph unless the trust instrument provides that persons who are not citizens of the United States may not hold more than 25 percent of the aggregate authority to so direct or remove a trustee.
<br>
<br>(C) Ownership by non-citizens.—Subparagraphs (A) and (B) do not prohibit a person that is not a citizen of the United States from holding more than 25 percent of the beneficial interest in a trust.
<br>
<br>(3) Citizenship of person chartering vessel.—If a person chartering a vessel from a trust that qualifies under paragraph (2) is a citizen of the United States under section 50501 of this title, the vessel is deemed to be owned by a citizen of the United States for purposes of that section and related laws, except chapter 531 of this title.
