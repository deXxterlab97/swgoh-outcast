<br>(F) set forth adequate assurances that the guaranty agency will not engage in any pattern or practice which results in a denial of a borrower's access to loans under this part because of the borrower's race, sex, color, religion, national origin, age, handicapped status, income, attendance at a particular eligible institution within the area served by the guaranty agency, length of the borrower's educational program, or the borrower's academic year in school;
<br>
<br>(G) shall prohibit the Secretary from making any reimbursement under this subsection to a guaranty agency when a default claim is based on an inability to locate the borrower, unless the guaranty agency, at the time of filing for reimbursement, certifies to the Secretary that diligent attempts, including contact with the institution, have been made to locate the borrower through the use of reasonable skip-tracing techniques in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary; and
<br>
<br>(H) set forth assurances that—
<br>
<br>(i) upon the request of an eligible institution, the guaranty agency shall, subject to clauses (ii) and (iii), furnish to the institution information with respect to students (including the names and addresses of such students) who received loans made, insured, or guaranteed under this part for attendance at the eligible institution and for whom default aversion assistance activities have been requested under subsection (l);
<br>
<br>(ii) the guaranty agency shall not require the payment from the institution of any fee for such information; and
<br>
<br>(iii) the guaranty agency will require the institution to use such information only to assist the institution in reminding students of their obligation to repay student loans and shall prohibit the institution from disseminating the information for any other purpose.
<br>
<br>(I) may include such other provisions as may be necessary to promote the purpose of this part.
<br>(3) Forbearance
<br>
<br>A guaranty agreement under this subsection—
<br>
<br>(A) shall contain provisions providing that—
<br>
<br>(i) upon request, a lender shall grant a borrower forbearance, renewable at 12-month intervals, on terms agreed to by the parties to the loan with the approval of the insurer and documented in accordance with paragraph (10), and otherwise consistent with the regulations of the Secretary, if the borrower—
<br>
<br>(I) is serving in a medical or dental internship or residency program, the successful completion of which is required to begin professional practice or service, or is serving in a medical or dental internship or residency program leading to a degree or certificate awarded by an institution of higher education, a hospital, or a health care facility that offers postgraduate training, provided that if the borrower qualifies for a deferment under section 1077(a)(2)(C)(vii) of this title or subsection (b)(1)(M)(vii) of this section as in effect prior to the enactment of the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, or section 1077(a)(2)(C) of this title or subsection (b)(1)(M) of this section as amended by such amendments, the borrower has exhausted his or her eligibility for such deferment;
<br>
<br>(II) has a debt burden under this subchapter that equals or exceeds 20 percent of income;
<br>
<br>(III) is serving in a national service position for which the borrower receives a national service educational award under the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993; or
<br>
<br>(IV) is eligible for interest payments to be made on such loan for service in the Armed Forces under section 2174 of title 10, and, pursuant to that eligibility, the interest is being paid on such loan under subsection (o);
<br>
<br>(ii) the length of the forbearance granted by the lender—
<br>
<br>(I) under clause (i)(I) shall equal the length of time remaining in the borrower's medical or dental internship or residency program, if the borrower is not eligible to receive a deferment described in such clause, or such length of time remaining in the program after the borrower has exhausted the borrower's eligibility for such deferment;
<br>
<br>(II) under clause (i)(II) or (IV) shall not exceed 3 years; or
<br>
<br>(III) under clause (i)(III) shall not exceed the period for which the borrower is serving in a position described in such clause; and
<br>
<br>(iii) no administrative or other fee may be charged in connection with the granting of a forbearance under clause (i), and no adverse information regarding a borrower may be reported to a consumer reporting agency solely because of the granting of such forbearance;
<br>
<br>(B) may, to the extent provided in regulations of the Secretary, contain provisions that permit such forbearance for the benefit of the student borrower as may be agreed upon by the parties to an insured loan and approved by the insurer;
<br>
<br>(C) shall contain provisions that specify that—
<br>
<br>(i) the form of forbearance granted by the lender pursuant to this paragraph, other than subparagraph (A)(i)(IV), shall be temporary cessation of payments, unless the borrower selects forbearance in the form of an extension of time for making payments, or smaller payments than were previously scheduled;
<br>
<br>(ii) the form of forbearance granted by the lender pursuant to subparagraph (A)(i)(IV) shall be the temporary cessation of all payments on the loan other than payments of interest on the loan that are made under subsection (o);
<br>
<br>(iii) the lender shall, at the time of granting a borrower forbearance, provide information to the borrower to assist the borrower in understanding the impact of capitalization of interest on the borrower's loan principal and total amount of interest to be paid during the life of the loan; and
<br>
<br>(iv) the lender shall contact the borrower not less often than once every 180 days during the period of forbearance to inform the borrower of—
<br>
<br>(I) the amount of unpaid principal and the amount of interest that has accrued since the last statement of such amounts provided to the borrower by the lender;
<br>
<br>(II) the fact that interest will accrue on the loan for the period of forbearance;
<br>
<br>(III) the amount of interest that will be capitalized, and the date on which capitalization will occur;
<br>
<br>(IV) the option of the borrower to pay the interest that has accrued before the interest is capitalized; and
<br>
<br>(V) the borrower's option to discontinue the forbearance at any time; and
<br>
<br>(D) shall contain provisions that specify that—
<br>
<br>(i) forbearance for a period not to exceed 60 days may be granted if the lender reasonably determines that such a suspension of collection activity is warranted following a borrower's request for deferment, forbearance, a change in repayment plan, or a request to consolidate loans, in order to collect or process appropriate supporting documentation related to the request, and
<br>
<br>(ii) during such period interest shall accrue but not be capitalized.
<br>
<br>Guaranty agencies shall not be precluded from permitting the parties to such a loan from entering into a forbearance agreement solely because the loan is in default. The Secretary shall permit lenders to exercise administrative forbearances that do not require the agreement of the borrower, under conditions authorized by the Secretary. Such forbearances shall include (i) forbearances for borrowers who are delinquent at the time of the granting of an authorized period of deferment under subsection (b)(1)(M) or section 1077(a)(2)(C) of this title, and (ii) if the borrower is less than 60 days delinquent on such loans at the time of sale or transfer, forbearances for borrowers on loans which are sold or transferred.

<br>In the case of any guaranty agreement with a guaranty agency, the Secretary may, in accordance with the terms of this subsection, undertake to guarantee loans described in paragraph (1) which are insured by such guaranty agency and are outstanding on the date of execution of the guaranty agreement, but only with respect to defaults occurring after the execution of such guaranty agreement or, if later, after its effective date.
<br>(6) Secretary's equitable share
<br>
<br>(A) For the purpose of paragraph (2)(D), the Secretary's equitable share of payments made by the borrower shall be that portion of the payments remaining after the guaranty agency with which the Secretary has an agreement under this subsection has deducted from such payments—
<br>
<br>(i) a percentage amount equal to the complement of the reinsurance percentage in effect when payment under the guaranty agreement was made with respect to the loan; and
<br>
<br>(ii) an amount equal to 24 percent of such payments for use in accordance with section 1072b of this title, except that—

<br>(I) beginning October 1, 2003 and ending September 30, 2007, this clause shall be applied by substituting "23 percent" for "24 percent"; and
<br>
<br>(II) beginning October 1, 2007, this clause shall be applied by substituting "16 percent" for "24 percent".
<br>
<br>(B) A guaranty agency shall—
<br>
<br>(i) on or after October 1, 2006—
<br>
<br>(I) not charge the borrower collection costs in an amount in excess of 18.5 percent of the outstanding principal and interest of a defaulted loan that is paid off through consolidation by the borrower under this subchapter; and

<br>(7) New programs eligible for 100 percent reinsurance
<br>
<br>(A) Notwithstanding paragraph (1)(C), the amount to be paid a guaranty agency for any fiscal year—
<br>
<br>(i) which begins on or after October 1, 1977 and ends before October 1, 1991; and
<br>
<br>(ii) which is either the fiscal year in which such guaranty agency begins to actively carry on a student loan insurance program which is subject to a guaranty agreement under subsection (b) of this section, or is one of the 4 succeeding fiscal years,
<br>
<br>shall be 100 percent of the amount expended by such guaranty agency in discharge of its insurance obligation insured under such program.
<br>
<br>(B) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1)(C), the Secretary may pay a guaranty agency 100 percent of the amount expended by such agency in discharge of such agency's insurance obligation for any fiscal year which—
<br>
<br>(i) begins on or after October 1, 1991; and
<br>
<br>(ii) is the fiscal year in which such guaranty agency begins to actively carry on a student loan insurance program which is subject to a guaranty agreement under subsection (b) or is one of the 4 succeeding fiscal years.
<br>
<br>(C) The Secretary shall continuously monitor the operations of those guaranty agencies to which the provisions of subparagraph (A) or (B) are applicable and revoke the application of such subparagraph to any such guaranty agency which the Secretary determines has not exercised reasonable prudence in the administration of such program.
<br>(8) Assignment to protect Federal fiscal interest
<br>
<br>If the Secretary determines that the protection of the Federal fiscal interest so requires, a guaranty agency shall assign to the Secretary any loan of which it is the holder and for which the Secretary has made a payment pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection.
<br>(9) Guaranty agency reserve level
<br>
<br>(A) Each guaranty agency which has entered into an agreement with the Secretary pursuant to this subsection shall maintain in the agency's Federal Student Loan Reserve Fund established under section 1072a of this title a current minimum reserve level of at least 0.25 percent of the total attributable amount of all outstanding loans guaranteed by such agency. For purposes of this paragraph, such total attributable amount does not include amounts of outstanding loans transferred to the guaranty agency from another guaranty agency pursuant to a plan of the Secretary in response to the insolvency of the latter such guaranty agency.
<br>
<br>(B) The Secretary shall collect, on an annual basis, information from each guaranty agency having an agreement under this subsection to enable the Secretary to evaluate the financial solvency of each such agency. The information collected shall include the level of such agency's current reserves, cash disbursements and accounts receivable.
<br>
<br>(C) If (i) any guaranty agency falls below the required minimum reserve level in any 2 consecutive years, (ii) any guaranty agency's Federal reimbursement payments are reduced to 85 percent pursuant to paragraph (1)(B)(i), or (iii) the Secretary determines that the administrative or financial condition of a guaranty agency jeopardizes such agency's continued ability to perform its responsibilities under its guaranty agreement, then the Secretary shall require the guaranty agency to submit and implement a management plan acceptable to the Secretary within 45 working days of any such event.
<br>
<br>(D)(i) If the Secretary is not seeking to terminate the guaranty agency's agreement under subparagraph (E), or assuming the guaranty agency's functions under subparagraph (F), a management plan described in subparagraph (C) shall include the means by which the guaranty agency will improve its financial and administrative condition to the required level within 18 months.
<br>
<br>(ii) If the Secretary is seeking to terminate the guaranty agency's agreement under subparagraph (E), or assuming the guaranty agency's functions under subparagraph (F), a management plan described in subparagraph (C) shall include the means by which the Secretary and the guaranty agency shall work together to ensure the orderly termination of the operations, and liquidation of the assets, of the guaranty agency.
<br>
<br>(E) The Secretary may terminate a guaranty agency's agreement in accordance with subparagraph (F) if—

<br>
<br>(ii) the Secretary determines that a guaranty agency has failed to improve substantially its administrative and financial condition;
<br>
<br>(iii) the Secretary determines that the guaranty agency is in danger of financial collapse;
<br>
<br>(iv) the Secretary determines that such action is necessary to protect the Federal fiscal interest; or
<br>
<br>(v) the Secretary determines that such action is necessary to ensure the continued availability of loans to student or parent borrowers.
<br>
<br>(F) If a guaranty agency's agreement under this subsection is terminated pursuant to subparagraph (E), then the Secretary shall assume responsibility for all functions of the guaranty agency under the loan insurance program of such agency. In performing such functions the Secretary is authorized to—
<br>
<br>(i) permit the transfer of guarantees to another guaranty agency;
<br>
<br>(ii) revoke the reinsurance agreement of the guaranty agency at a specified date, so as to require the merger, consolidation, or termination of the guaranty agency;
<br>
<br>(iii) transfer guarantees to the Department of Education for the purpose of payment of such claims and process such claims using the claims standards of the guaranty agency, if such standards are determined by the Secretary to be in compliance with this chapter;
<br>
<br>(iv) design and implement a plan to restore the guaranty agency's viability;
<br>
<br>(v) provide the guaranty agency with additional advance funds in accordance with section 1072(c)(7) of this title, with such restrictions on the use of such funds as is determined appropriate by the Secretary, in order to—
<br>
<br>(I) meet the immediate cash needs of the guaranty agency;
<br>
<br>(II) ensure the uninterrupted payment of claims; or
<br>
<br>(III) ensure that the guaranty agency will make loans as the lender-of-last-resort, in accordance with subsection (j);
<br>
<br>(vi) use all funds and assets of the guaranty agency to assist in the activities undertaken in accordance with this subparagraph and take appropriate action to require the return, to the guaranty agency or the Secretary, of any funds or assets provided by the guaranty agency, under contract or otherwise, to any person or organization; or
<br>
<br>(vii) take any other action the Secretary determines necessary to ensure the continued availability of loans made under this part to residents of the State or States in which the guaranty agency did business, the full honoring of all guarantees issued by the guaranty agency prior to the Secretary's assumption of the functions of such agency, and the proper servicing of loans guaranteed by the guaranty agency prior to the Secretary's assumption of the functions of such agency, and to avoid disruption of the student loan program.
<br>
<br>(G) Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal or State law, if the Secretary has terminated or is seeking to terminate a guaranty agency's agreement under subparagraph (E), or has assumed a guaranty agency's functions under subparagraph (F)—
<br>
<br>(i) no State court may issue any order affecting the Secretary's actions with respect to such guaranty agency;
<br>
<br>(ii) any contract with respect to the administration of a guaranty agency's reserve funds, or the administration of any assets purchased or acquired with the reserve funds of the guaranty agency, that is entered into or extended by the guaranty agency, or any other party on behalf of or with the concurrence of the guaranty agency, after August 10, 1993, shall provide that the contract is terminable by the Secretary upon 30 days notice to the contracting parties if the Secretary determines that such contract includes an impermissible transfer of the reserve funds or assets, or is otherwise inconsistent with the terms or purposes of this section; and
<br>
<br>(iii) no provision of State law shall apply to the actions of the Secretary in terminating the operations of a guaranty agency.
<br>
<br>(H) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary's liability for any outstanding liabilities of a guaranty agency (other than outstanding student loan guarantees under this part), the functions of which the Secretary has assumed, shall not exceed the fair market value of the reserves of the guaranty agency, minus any necessary liquidation or other administrative costs.
<br>
<br>(I) The Secretary shall not take any action under subparagraph (E) or (F) without giving the guaranty agency notice and the opportunity for a hearing that, if commenced after September 24, 1998, shall be on the record.
<br>
<br>(J) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the information transmitted to the Secretary pursuant to this paragraph shall be confidential and exempt from disclosure under section 552 of title 5, relating to freedom of information, or any other Federal law.
<br>
<br>(K) The Secretary, within 6 months after the end of each fiscal year, shall submit to the authorizing committees a report specifying the Secretary's assessment of the fiscal soundness of the guaranty agency system.
<br>(10) Documentation of forbearance agreements
<br>
<br>For the purposes of paragraph (3), the terms of forbearance agreed to by the parties shall be documented by confirming the agreement of the borrower by notice to the borrower from the lender, and by recording the terms in the borrower's file.
<br>(d) Usury laws inapplicable
<br>
<br>No provision of any law of the United States (other than this chapter and section 3937 of title 50) or of any State (other than a statute applicable principally to such State's student loan insurance program) which limits the rate or amount of interest payable on loans shall apply to a loan—
<br>
<br>(1) which bears interest (exclusive of any premium for insurance) on the unpaid principal balance at a rate not in excess of the rate specified in this part; and
<br>
<br>(2) which is insured (i) by the United States under this part, or (ii) by a guaranty agency under a program covered by an agreement made pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.

<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary—
<br>

<br>(i) Multiple disbursement of loans
<br>(1) Escrow accounts administered by escrow agent
<br>
<br>Any guaranty agency or eligible lender (hereafter in this subsection referred to as the "escrow agent") may enter into an agreement with any other eligible lender that is not an eligible institution or an agency or instrumentality of the State (hereafter in this subsection referred to as the "lender") for the purpose of authorizing disbursements of the proceeds of a loan to a student. Such agreement shall provide that the lender will pay the proceeds of such loans into an escrow account to be administered by the escrow agent in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection. Such agreement may allow the lender to make payments into the escrow account in amounts that do not exceed the sum of the amounts required for disbursement of initial or subsequent installments to borrowers and to make such payments not more than 10 days prior to the date of the disbursement of such installment to such borrowers. Such agreement shall require the lender to notify promptly the eligible institution when funds are escrowed under this subsection for a student at such institution.
<br>(2) Authority of escrow agent
<br>
<br>Each escrow agent entering into an agreement under paragraph (1) of this subsection is authorized to—
<br>
<br>(A) make the disbursements in accordance with the note evidencing the loan;
<br>
<br>(B) commingle the proceeds of all loans paid to the escrow agent pursuant to the escrow agreement entered into under such paragraph (1);
<br>
<br>(C) invest the proceeds of such loans in obligations of the Federal Government or obligations which are insured or guaranteed by the Federal Government;
<br>
<br>(D) retain interest or other earnings on such investment; and
<br>
<br>(E) return to the lender undisbursed funds when the student ceases to carry at an eligible institution at least one-half of the normal full-time academic workload as determined by the institution.
<br>(j) Lenders-of-last-resort
<br>(1) General requirement
<br>
<br>In each State, the guaranty agency or an eligible lender in the State described in section 1085(d)(1)(D) of this title shall, before July 1, 2010, make loans directly, or through an agreement with an eligible lender or lenders, to eligible students and parents who are otherwise unable to obtain loans under this part (except for consolidation loans under section 1078–3 of this title) or who attend an institution of higher education in the State that is designated under paragraph (4). Loans made under this subsection shall not exceed the amount of the need of the borrower, as determined under subsection (a)(2)(B), nor be less than $200. No loan under section 1078, 1078–2, or 1078–8 of this title that is made pursuant to this subsection shall be made with interest rates, origination or default fees, or other terms and conditions that are more favorable to the borrower than the maximum interest rates, origination or default fees, or other terms and conditions applicable to that type of loan under this part. The guaranty agency shall consider the request of any eligible lender, as defined under section 1085(d)(1)(A) of this title, to serve as the lender-of-last-resort pursuant to this subsection.
<br>(2) Rules and operating procedures
<br>
<br>The guaranty agency shall develop rules and operating procedures for the lender-of-last-resort program designed to ensure that—
<br>
<br>(A) the program establishes operating hours and methods of application designed to facilitate application by students and ensure a response within 60 days after the student's original complete application is filed under this subsection;
<br>
<br>(B) consistent with standards established by the Secretary, students applying for loans under this subsection shall not be subject to additional eligibility requirements or requests for additional information beyond what is required under this subchapter in order to receive a loan under this part from an eligible lender, nor, in the case of students and parents applying for loans under this subsection because of an inability to otherwise obtain loans under this part (except for consolidation loans under section 1078–3 of this title), be required to receive more than two rejections from eligible lenders in order to obtain a loan under this subsection;
<br>
<br>(C) information about the availability of loans under the program is made available to institutions of higher education in the State; and
<br>
<br>(D) appropriate steps are taken to ensure that borrowers receiving loans under the program are appropriately counseled on their loan obligation.
<br>(3) Advances to guaranty agencies for lender-of-last-resort services
<br>
<br>(A) In order to ensure the availability of loan capital, the Secretary is authorized to provide a guaranty agency designated for a State with additional advance funds in accordance with subparagraph (C) and section 1072(c)(7) of this title, with such restrictions on the use of such funds as are determined appropriate by the Secretary, in order to ensure that the guaranty agency will make loans as the lender-of-last-resort. Such agency shall make such loans in accordance with this subsection and the requirements of the Secretary.
<br>
<br>(B) Notwithstanding any other provision in this part, a guaranty agency serving as a lender-of-last-resort under this paragraph shall be paid a fee, established by the Secretary, for making such loans in lieu of interest and special allowance subsidies, and shall be required to assign such loans to the Secretary on demand. Upon such assignment, the portion of the advance represented by the loans assigned shall be considered repaid by such guaranty agency.
<br>
<br>(C) The Secretary shall exercise the authority described in subparagraph (A) only if the Secretary determines that eligible borrowers are seeking and are unable to obtain loans under this part or designates an institution of higher education for participation in the program under this subsection under paragraph (4), and that the guaranty agency designated for that State has the capability to provide lender-of-last-resort loans in a timely manner, in accordance with the guaranty agency's obligations under paragraph (1), but cannot do so without advances provided by the Secretary under this paragraph. If the Secretary makes the determinations described in the preceding sentence and determines that it would be cost-effective to do so, the Secretary may provide advances under this paragraph to such guaranty agency. If the Secretary determines that such guaranty agency does not have such capability, or will not provide such loans in a timely fashion, the Secretary may provide such advances to enable another guaranty agency, that the Secretary determines to have such capability, to make lender-of-last-resort loans to eligible borrowers in that State who are experiencing loan access problems or to eligible borrowers who attend an institution in the State that is designated under paragraph (4).
<br>(4) Institution-wide student qualification
<br>
<br>Upon the request of an institution of higher education and pursuant to standards developed by the Secretary, the Secretary shall designate such institution for participation in the lender-of-last-resort program under this paragraph.5 If the Secretary designates an institution under this paragraph, the guaranty agency designated for the State in which the institution is located shall make loans, in the same manner as such loans are made under paragraph (1), to students and parent borrowers of the designated institution, regardless of whether the students or parent borrowers are otherwise unable to obtain loans under this part (other than a consolidation loan under section 1078–3 of this title).
<br>(5) Standards developed by the Secretary
<br>
<br>In developing standards with respect to paragraph (4), the Secretary may require—
<br>
<br>(A) an institution of higher education to demonstrate that, despite due diligence on the part of the institution, the institution has been unable to secure the commitment of eligible lenders willing to make loans under this part to a significant number of students attending the institution;
<br>
<br>(B) that, prior to making a request under such paragraph for designation for participation in the lender-of-last-resort program, an institution of higher education shall demonstrate that the institution has met a minimum threshold, as determined by the Secretary, for the number or percentage of students at such institution who have received rejections from eligible lenders for loans under this part; and
<br>
<br>(C) any other standards and guidelines the Secretary determines to be appropriate.
<br>(6) Expiration of authority
<br>
<br>The Secretary's authority under paragraph (4) to designate institutions of higher education for participation in the program under this subsection shall expire on June 30, 2010.
<br>(7) Expiration of designation
<br>
<br>The eligibility of an institution of higher education, or borrowers from such institution, to participate in the program under this subsection pursuant to a designation of the institution by the Secretary under paragraph (4) shall expire on June 30, 2010. After such date, borrowers from an institution designated under paragraph (4) shall be eligible to participate in the program under this subsection as such program existed on the day before May 7, 2008.
<br>(8) Prohibition on inducements and marketing
<br>
<br>Each guaranty agency or eligible lender that serves as a lender-of-last-resort under this subsection—
<br>
<br>(A) shall be subject to the prohibitions on inducements contained in subsection (b)(3) and the requirements of section 1085(d)(5) of this title; and
<br>
<br>(B) shall not advertise, market, or otherwise promote loans under this subsection, except that nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit a guaranty agency from fulfilling its responsibilities under paragraph (2)(C).
<br>(9) Dissemination and reporting
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall—
<br>
<br>(i) broadly disseminate information regarding the availability of loans made under this subsection;
<br>
<br>(ii) during the period beginning July 1, 2008 and ending June 30, 2011, provide to the authorizing committees and make available to the public—
<br>
<br>(I) copies of any new or revised plans or agreements made by guaranty agencies or the Department related to the authorities under this subsection;
<br>
<br>(II) quarterly reports on—
<br>
<br>(aa) the number and amounts of loans originated or approved pursuant to this subsection by each guaranty agency and eligible lender; and
<br>

<br>Subject to paragraph (3), any guaranty agency that has entered into or enters into any insurance program agreement with the Secretary under this part may—

Beginning in fiscal year 2001, any guaranty agency that has an insurance program agreement with the Secretary may offer blanket certificates of guaranty under this subsection.
<br>(4) Report required
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall, at the conclusion of the pilot program under paragraph (3), provide a report to the authorizing committees on the impact of the blanket certificates of guaranty on program efficiency and integrity.

The Secretary may not pay interest or any special allowance on such a loan out of any funds other than funds that have been so transferred.
<br>(2) Forbearance
