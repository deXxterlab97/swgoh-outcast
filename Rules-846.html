<br>§2278. Explosives on vessels carrying steerage passengers
<br>
<br>Whoever, being the master of a steamship or other vessel referred to in section 151 of Title 46, except as otherwise expressly provided by law, takes, carries, or has on board of any such vessel any nitroglycerin, dynamite, or any other explosive article or compound, or any vitriol or like acids, or gunpowder, except for the ship's use, or any article or number of articles, whether as a cargo or ballast, which, by reason of the nature or quantity or mode of storage thereof, shall, either singly or collectively, be likely to endanger the health or lives of the passengers or the safety of the vessel, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on section 171 of title 46, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Shipping (Aug. 2, 1882, ch. 374, §8, 22 Stat. 189).
<br>

<br>
<br>Words "shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and" were omitted because designation of the offense as a misdemeanor is unnecessary in view of definitive section 1 of this title.
<br>
<br>Mandatory punishment provision was rephrased in the alternative.

<br>Section 151 of Title 46, referred to in text, which was based on section 1 of act Aug. 2, 1882, ch. 374, 22 Stat. 186, as amended, was repealed by Pub. L. 98–89, Aug. 26, 1983, §4(b), 97 Stat. 599.

<br>§2279. Boarding vessels before arrival
<br>
<br>Whoever, not being in the United States service, and not being duly authorized by law for the purpose, goes on board any vessel about to arrive at the place of her destination, before her actual arrival, and before she has been completely moored, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than six months, or both.
<br>
<br>The master of such vessel may take any such person into custody, and deliver him up forthwith to any law enforcement officer, to be by him taken before any committing magistrate, to be dealt with according to law.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on section 708 of title 46, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Shipping (R.S. §4606).
<br>
<br>"Law enforcement officer" was substituted for "constable or police officer" and "committing magistrate" for "justice of the peace." The phraseology used in the statute was archaic. It originated when the government had few law enforcement officers and magistrates of its own.
<br>
<br>References to specific sections were made to read: "according to law" to achieve brevity.
<br>
<br>Mandatory punishment provision was rephrased in the alternative.
<br>
<br>The words "without permission of the master" were deleted to remove an inconsistency with the provisions of section 163 of title 46, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and customs regulations. Customs regulations, 1943, section 4.1c, prohibit any person "with or without consent of the master" from boarding vessel, with specific enumerated exceptions. Said section 163 prescribes a "penalty of not more than $100 or imprisonment not to exceed six months, or both" for violating regulations. The revised section increases the fine from $100 to $200 for boarding the vessel "with the consent of the master."

<br>Minor changes were made in phraseology.
