<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>1948 Act
<br>
<br>Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§600, 600a, 600b, 608, and sections 11–1512 and 11–1513 of the D.C. Code, 1940 ed., (R.S. §§236, 323; Apr. 26, 1926, ch. 183, §§1, 2, 44 Stat. 323; May 17, 1932, ch. 190, 47 Stat. 158; Oct. 13, 1941, ch. 431, §2, 55 Stat. 736).
<br>
<br>Section consolidates section 600 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and sections 11–1512 and 11–1513 of the D.C. Code, 1940 ed., with part of section 608 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed. The remainder of such section 608, relating to payment of witnesses' compensation, is the basis of section 1825 of this title.
<br>
<br>Words "place of service" were substituted for references to attendance at court, in view of the earlier reference to service before commissioners.
<br>
<br>The Advisory Committee to the House Committee on Revision of the Laws in revision of this title, recommends a careful study of the compensation of witnesses and jurors. Furthermore, provision should be made for the subsistence of jurors and witnesses serving at such distance from their homes as precludes daily travel to and from the court.
<br>
<br>Changes were made in phraseology.
<br>1949 Act
<br>
<br>This section incorporates in section 1871 of title 28, U.S.C., with changes in phraseology, the provisions of act of June 25, 1948 (ch. 652, 62 Stat. 1016), which became law subsequent to the enactment of the revision.

<br>

<br>
<br>The provision in section 549 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for payment of fees by the parties instituting criminal proceedings by indictment or information, was omitted. Such proceedings are instituted only by the United States from which costs cannot be exacted.

<br>
<br>Words "or appeal from a deportation order of a United States Commissioner" in section 553 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted as obsolete since repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act by act Dec. 17, 1943, ch. 344, §1, 57 Stat. 600. Appeal was formerly conferred by section 282 of title 8, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Aliens and Nationality.

<br>§1915. Proceedings in forma pauperis
<br>
<br>(a)(1) Subject to subsection (b), any court of the United States may authorize the commencement, prosecution or defense of any suit, action or proceeding, civil or criminal, or appeal therein, without prepayment of fees or security therefor, by a person who submits an affidavit that includes a statement of all assets such prisoner possesses that the person is unable to pay such fees or give security therefor. Such affidavit shall state the nature of the action, defense or appeal and affiant's belief that the person is entitled to redress.
<br>
<br>(2) A prisoner seeking to bring a civil action or appeal a judgment in a civil action or proceeding without prepayment of fees or security therefor, in addition to filing the affidavit filed under paragraph (1), shall submit a certified copy of the trust fund account statement (or institutional equivalent) for the prisoner for the 6-month period immediately preceding the filing of the complaint or notice of appeal, obtained from the appropriate official of each prison at which the prisoner is or was confined.
<br>
<br>(3) An appeal may not be taken in forma pauperis if the trial court certifies in writing that it is not taken in good faith.
<br>
<br>(b)(1) Notwithstanding subsection (a), if a prisoner brings a civil action or files an appeal in forma pauperis, the prisoner shall be required to pay the full amount of a filing fee. The court shall assess and, when funds exist, collect, as a partial payment of any court fees required by law, an initial partial filing fee of 20 percent of the greater of—
<br>
<br>(A) the average monthly deposits to the prisoner's account; or
<br>
<br>(B) the average monthly balance in the prisoner's account for the 6-month period immediately preceding the filing of the complaint or notice of appeal.
<br>
<br>(2) After payment of the initial partial filing fee, the prisoner shall be required to make monthly payments of 20 percent of the preceding month's income credited to the prisoner's account. The agency having custody of the prisoner shall forward payments from the prisoner's account to the clerk of the court each time the amount in the account exceeds $10 until the filing fees are paid.
<br>
<br>(3) In no event shall the filing fee collected exceed the amount of fees permitted by statute for the commencement of a civil action or an appeal of a civil action or criminal judgment.
<br>
<br>(4) In no event shall a prisoner be prohibited from bringing a civil action or appealing a civil or criminal judgment for the reason that the prisoner has no assets and no means by which to pay the initial partial filing fee.
<br>
<br>(c) Upon the filing of an affidavit in accordance with subsections (a) and (b) and the prepayment of any partial filing fee as may be required under subsection (b), the court may direct payment by the United States of the expenses of (1) printing the record on appeal in any civil or criminal case, if such printing is required by the appellate court; (2) preparing a transcript of proceedings before a United States magistrate judge in any civil or criminal case, if such transcript is required by the district court, in the case of proceedings conducted under section 636(b) of this title or under section 3401(b) of title 18, United States Code; and (3) printing the record on appeal if such printing is required by the appellate court, in the case of proceedings conducted pursuant to section 636(c) of this title. Such expenses shall be paid when authorized by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.
<br>
<br>(d) The officers of the court shall issue and serve all process, and perform all duties in such cases. Witnesses shall attend as in other cases, and the same remedies shall be available as are provided for by law in other cases.
<br>
<br>(e)(1) The court may request an attorney to represent any person unable to afford counsel.
<br>
<br>(2) Notwithstanding any filing fee, or any portion thereof, that may have been paid, the court shall dismiss the case at any time if the court determines that—
<br>
<br>(A) the allegation of poverty is untrue; or
<br>
<br>(B) the action or appeal—
<br>
<br>(i) is frivolous or malicious;
<br>
<br>(ii) fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted; or
<br>
<br>(iii) seeks monetary relief against a defendant who is immune from such relief.
<br>
<br>(f)(1) Judgment may be rendered for costs at the conclusion of the suit or action as in other proceedings, but the United States shall not be liable for any of the costs thus incurred. If the United States has paid the cost of a stenographic transcript or printed record for the prevailing party, the same shall be taxed in favor of the United States.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) If the judgment against a prisoner includes the payment of costs under this subsection, the prisoner shall be required to pay the full amount of the costs ordered.
<br>
<br>(B) The prisoner shall be required to make payments for costs under this subsection in the same manner as is provided for filing fees under subsection (a)(2).
<br>
<br>(C) In no event shall the costs collected exceed the amount of the costs ordered by the court.
<br>
<br>(g) In no event shall a prisoner bring a civil action or appeal a judgment in a civil action or proceeding under this section if the prisoner has, on 3 or more prior occasions, while incarcerated or detained in any facility, brought an action or appeal in a court of the United States that was dismissed on the grounds that it is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, unless the prisoner is under imminent danger of serious physical injury.
<br>
<br>(h) As used in this section, the term "prisoner" means any person incarcerated or detained in any facility who is accused of, convicted of, sentenced for, or adjudicated delinquent for, violations of criminal law or the terms and conditions of parole, probation, pretrial release, or diversionary program.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>1948 Act
<br>
<br>Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§9a(c)(e), 832, 833, 834, 835, and 836 (July 20, 1892, ch. 209, §§1–5, 27 Stat. 252; June 25, 1910, ch. 435, 36 Stat. 866; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §5a, as added Jan. 20, 1944, ch. 3, §1, 58 Stat. 5; June 27, 1922, ch. 246, 42 Stat. 666; Jan. 31, 1928, ch. 14, §1, 45 Stat. 54).
<br>
<br>Section consolidates a part of section 9a(c)(e) with sections 832–836 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.
<br>
<br>For distribution of other provisions of section 9a of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., see Distribution Table.
<br>
<br>Section 832 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., was completely rewritten, and constitutes subsections (a) and (b).
<br>
<br>Words "and willful false swearing in any affidavit provided for in this section or section 832 of this title, shall be punishable as perjury as in other cases," in section 833 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted as covered by the general perjury statute, title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §231 (H.R. 1600, 80th Cong., sec. 1621).
<br>
<br>A proviso in section 836 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that the United States should not be liable for costs was deleted as covered by section 2412 of this title.
<br>
<br>The provision in section 9a(e) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., respecting stenographic transcripts furnished on appeals in civil cases is extended by subsection (b) of the revised section to include criminal cases. Obviously it would be inconsistent to furnish the same to a poor person in a civil case involving money only and to deny it in a criminal proceeding where life and liberty are in jeopardy.
<br>
<br>The provision of section 832 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for payment when authorized by the Attorney General was revised to substitute the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts who now disburses such items.
<br>
<br>Changes in phraseology were made.
<br>1949 Act
<br>
<br>This amendment clarifies the meaning of subsection (b) of section 1915 of title 28, U.S.C., and supplies, in subsection (e) of section 1915, an inadvertent omission to make possible the recovery of public funds expended in printing the record for persons successfully suing in forma pauperis.

<br>
<br>(b) Grounds for Dismissal.—On review, the court shall identify cognizable claims or dismiss the complaint, or any portion of the complaint, if the complaint—

<br>
<br>(2) seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.
<br>

<br>
<br>Words "as an additional fee in said suit or action, or proceeding in bankruptcy" were omitted.

The substituted language is sufficient. (See reviser's note under section 1359 of this title.)

<br>§1921. United States marshal's fees
<br>
<br>(a)(1) The United States marshals or deputy marshals shall routinely collect, and a court may tax as costs, fees for the following:
<br>
<br>(A) Serving a writ of possession, partition, execution, attachment in rem, or libel in admiralty, warrant, attachment, summons, complaints, or any other writ, order or process in any case or proceeding.
<br>
<br>(B) Serving a subpoena or summons for a witness or appraiser.
<br>
<br>(C) Forwarding any writ, order, or process to another judicial district for service.
<br>
<br>(D) The preparation of any notice of sale, proclamation in admiralty, or other public notice or bill of sale.
<br>
<br>(E) The keeping of attached property (including boats, vessels, or other property attached or libeled), actual expenses incurred, such as storage, moving, boat hire, or other special transportation, watchmen's or keepers' fees, insurance, and an hourly rate, including overtime, for each deputy marshal required for special services, such as guarding, inventorying, and moving.
<br>
<br>(F) Copies of writs or other papers furnished at the request of any party.
<br>
<br>(G) Necessary travel in serving or endeavoring to serve any process, writ, or order, except in the District of Columbia, with mileage to be computed from the place where service is returnable to the place of service or endeavor.
<br>
<br>(H) Overtime expenses incurred by deputy marshals in the course of serving or executing civil process.
<br>
<br>(2) The marshals shall collect, in advance, a deposit to cover the initial expenses for special services required under paragraph (1)(E), and periodically thereafter such amounts as may be necessary to pay such expenses until the litigation is concluded. This paragraph applies to all private litigants, including seamen proceeding pursuant to section 1916 of this title.
<br>
<br>(3) For purposes of paragraph (1)(G), if two or more services or endeavors, or if an endeavor and a service, are made in behalf of the same party in the same case on the same trip, mileage shall be computed to the place of service or endeavor which is most remote from the place where service is returnable, adding thereto any additional mileage traveled in serving or endeavoring to serve in behalf of the party. If two or more writs of any kind, required to be served in behalf of the same party on the same person in the same case or proceeding, may be served at the same time, mileage on only one such writ shall be collected.
<br>
<br>(b) The Attorney General shall from time to time prescribe by regulation the fees to be taxed and collected under subsection (a). Such fees shall, to the extent practicable, reflect the actual and reasonable cost of the service provided.
<br>
<br>(c)(1) The United States Marshals Service shall collect a commission of 3 percent of the first $1,000 collected and 1½ percent on the excess of any sum over $1,000, for seizing or levying on property (including seizures in admiralty), disposing of such property by sale, setoff, or otherwise, and receiving and paying over money, except that the amount of commission shall be within the range set by the Attorney General. if 1 the property is not disposed of by marshal's sale, the commission shall be in such amount, within the range set by the Attorney General, as may be allowed by the court. In any case in which the vessel or other property is sold by a public auctioneer, or by some party other than a marshal or deputy marshal, the commission authorized under this subsection shall be reduced by the amount paid to such auctioneer or other party. This subsection applies to any judicially ordered sale or execution sale, without regard to whether the judicial order of sale constitutes a seizure or levy within the meaning of State law. This subsection shall not apply to any seizure, forfeiture, sale, or other disposition of property pursuant to the applicable provisions of law amended by the Comprehensive Forfeiture Act of 1984 (98 Stat. 2040).
<br>
<br>(2) The Attorney General shall prescribe from time to time regulations which establish a minimum and maximum amount for the commission collected under paragraph (1).
<br>
<br>(d) The United States marshals may require a deposit to cover the fees and expenses prescribed under this section.
<br>
<br>(e) Notwithstanding section 3302 of title 31, the United States Marshals Service is authorized, to the extent provided in advance in appropriations Acts—
<br>
<br>(1) to credit to such Service's appropriation all fees, commissions, and expenses collected by such Service for—
<br>
<br>(A) the service of civil process, including complaints, summonses, subpoenas, and similar process; and
<br>
<br>(B) seizures, levies, and sales associated with judicial orders of execution; and
<br>
<br>(2) to use such credited amounts for the purpose of carrying out such activities.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §574 (R.S. §§823, 829; May 28, 1896, ch. 252, §6, 29 Stat. 179; May 29, 1930, ch. 356, 46 Stat. 486; Aug. 3, 1935, ch. 431, §2, 49 Stat. 513).
<br>
<br>Provisions for serving venires and summoning grand and petit jurors were omitted as useless since marshal's fees are now covered into the Treasury and there is no basis for apportioning the cost of summoning jurors for a term of court and taxing the same to individual cases.
<br>
<br>The marshal's fee "for holding a court of inquiry or other proceedings before a jury, including summoning a jury, $5" is omitted as obsolete in the Federal practice. See, Black's Law Dictionary "Court of Inquiry." See, also, Webster's International Dictionary.
<br>
<br>A fee of 50 cents "for each bail bond" is omitted as covered by the general provision for taxation of marshal's fees in criminal cases.
<br>
<br>The provisions for a fee of $5 for drawing and executing a deed and $1 for executing a deed prepared by a party or his attorney are omitted as unnecessary. It is the marshal's duty to execute conveyances of property which he sells on execution and his salary compensates him therefor. There is no occasion for him to draw such a deed and no beneficial purpose in taxing the parties a fee for his signature.
<br>
<br>The 2 per centum fee for disbursing moneys is omitted as an unnecessary burden upon funds belonging to litigants.
<br>
<br>The provision that a folio consists of "100 words or major fraction thereof" is inserted to conform with section 607 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which is transferred to title 44, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Public Printing and Documents, along with section 606 of said title 28, to which said section 607 also relates.
<br>
<br>The provision for a lump sum to be determined by the court and taxed in criminal cases was added. It fixes a maximum of $25 in misdemeanor cases and $100 in felony cases. It may be questioned whether costs as such should ever be taxed against the convicted defendant in a criminal case. The acquitted defendant is not permitted to tax costs against the United States. Indeed the allowance of costs in criminal cases is not a matter of right but rests completely within the discretion of the court. Morris v. United States, 1911, 185 Fed. 73, 107 C.C.A. 293.
<br>
<br>In Alberty v. U.S., C.C.A.9, 1937, 91 F.2d 461, the defendant was fined $100 on each of 11 accounts of an indictment under the 1906 Food and Drug Act (title 21, §§2, 10, U.S.C., 1934 ed., as amended). Costs of prosecution were taxed in the sum of $1,499.80. Yet the court in its discretion might have reached substantially the same result by imposing a fine of $200 on each count without any taxation of costs.
<br>
<br>Changes were made in phraseology.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§571, 572, and 578 (R.S. §§823, 824; May 28, 1896, ch. 252, §§6, 24, 29 Stat. 179, 186; Feb. 26, 1919, ch. 49, §1, 40 Stat. 1182; July 19, 1919, ch. 24, §1, 41 Stat. 209; Feb. 11, 1921, ch. 46, 41 Stat. 1099; June 6, 1930, ch. 409, 46 Stat. 522; Aug. 3, 1935, ch. 431, §1, 49 Stat. 513).
<br>
<br>Section consolidates sections 571, 572, and 578 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.
<br>
<br>The phrase "$20 on trial or final hearing in civil, criminal, or admiralty cases" was substituted for the following provisions of section 572 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., "On trial before a jury, in civil or criminal causes or before referees, or on a final hearing in equity or admiralty, a docket fee of $20", and the limitation of $10 in "cases at law when judgment is rendered without a jury" was omitted. This simplified restatement provides for a single docket fee in each case which reaches final hearing or trial. Since the docket fee is arbitrary, any limitation or distinction between law cases tried with or without a jury is unrealistic.
