<br>§21302. Findings
<br>
<br>Congress finds the following:
<br>
<br>(1) Men who father children through rape should be prohibited from visiting or having custody of those children.
<br>
<br>(2) Thousands of rape-related pregnancies occur annually in the United States.
<br>
<br>(3) A substantial number of women choose to raise their child conceived through rape and, as a result, may face custody battles with their rapists.
<br>
<br>(4) Rape is one of the most under-prosecuted serious crimes, with estimates of criminal conviction occurring in less than 5 percent of rapes.
<br>
<br>(5) The clear and convincing evidence standard is the most common standard for termination of parental rights among the 50 States, territories, and the District of Columbia.
<br>
<br>(6) The Supreme Court established that the clear and convincing evidence standard satisfies due process for allegations to terminate or restrict parental rights in Santosky v. Kramer (455 U.S. 745 (1982)).
<br>
<br>(7) Currently only 10 States have statutes allowing rape survivors to petition for the termination of parental rights of the rapist based on clear and convincing evidence that the child was conceived through rape.
<br>
<br>(8) A rapist pursuing parental or custody rights causes the survivor to have continued interaction with the rapist, which can have traumatic psychological effects on the survivor, and can make it more difficult for her to recover.
<br>
<br>(9) These traumatic effects on the mother can severely negatively impact her ability to raise a healthy child.
<br>
<br>(10) Rapists may use the threat of pursuing custody or parental rights to coerce survivors into not prosecuting rape, or otherwise harass, intimidate, or manipulate them.

<br>
<br>Congress finds the following:
<br>
<br>(1) Megan Nicole Kanka, who was 7 years old, was abducted, sexually assaulted, and murdered in 1994, in the State of New Jersey by a violent predator living across the street from her home. Unbeknownst to Megan Kanka and her family, he had been convicted previously of a sex offense against a child.
<br>
<br>(2) In 1996, Congress adopted Megan's Law (Public Law 104–145) as a means to encourage States to protect children by identifying the whereabouts of sex offenders and providing the means to monitor their activities.
<br>
<br>(3) In 2006, Congress passed the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 (Public Law 109–248) to protect children and the public at large by establishing a comprehensive national system for the registration and notification to the public and law enforcement officers of convicted sex offenders.
<br>
<br>(4) Law enforcement reports indicate that known child-sex offenders are traveling internationally.
<br>
<br>(5) The commercial sexual exploitation of minors in child sex trafficking and pornography is a global phenomenon. The International Labour Organization has estimated that 1,8000,000 1 children worldwide are victims of child sex trafficking and pornography each year.
<br>
<br>(6) Child sex tourism, where an individual travels to a foreign country and engages in sexual activity with a child in that country, is a form of child exploitation and, where commercial, child sex trafficking.
