<br>§2515. Foreign Currency Fluctuations Account
<br>(a) Establishment
<br>
<br>(1) There is established in the Treasury of the United States an account to be known as the "Foreign Currency Fluctuations, Peace Corps, Account". The account shall be used for the purpose of providing funds to pay expenses for operations of the Peace Corps outside the United States which, as a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates, exceed the amount appropriated for such expenses.
<br>
<br>(2) Funds in the account may be transferred, upon the certification of the Director of the Peace Corps (or the Director's designee) that the transfer is necessary for the purpose specified in paragraph (1), to the account containing funds appropriated for the expenses of the Peace Corps.
<br>(b) Use of funds in account
<br>
<br>Funds transferred under subsection (a) shall be merged with, and be available for the same time period, as the appropriation to which they are applied. Notwithstanding any provision of law limiting the amount of funds the Peace Corps may obligate in any fiscal year, such amount shall be increased to the extent necessary to reflect fluctuations in exchange rates from those used in preparing the budget submission.
<br>(c) Exchange rates applicable to obligations
<br>
<br>An obligation of the Peace Corps payable in the currency of a foreign country may be recorded as an obligation based upon exchange rates used in preparing a budget submission. A change reflecting fluctuations in exchange rates may be recorded as a disbursement is made.
<br>(d) Transfers back to account
<br>
<br>Funds transferred from the Foreign Currency Fluctuations, Peace Corps, Account may be transferred back to that account—
<br>
<br>(1) if the funds are not needed to pay obligations incurred because of fluctuations in currency exchange rates of foreign countries in the appropriation to which the funds were originally transferred; or
<br>
<br>(2) because of subsequent favorable fluctuations in the rates or because other funds are, or become, available to pay such obligations.
<br>(e) Limitation on transfers back
<br>
<br>A transfer of funds back to the account under subsection (d) may not be made after the end of the fiscal year or other period for which the appropriation, to which the funds were originally transferred, is available for obligation.
<br>(f) Transfers to account from regular appropriations
<br>
<br>(1) At the end of the fiscal year or other period for which appropriations for the expenses of the Peace Corps are made available, unobligated balances of such appropriation may be transferred into the Foreign Currency Fluctuations, Peace Corps, Account, to be merged with, and to be available for the same period and purposes as, that account.
<br>
<br>(2) The authority of this subsection shall be exercised only to the extent that specific amounts are provided in advance in an appropriation Act.
<br>(g) Authorization of appropriations
<br>
<br>There are authorized to be appropriated to the Foreign Currency Fluctuations, Peace Corps, Account for each fiscal year such sums as may be necessary to maintain a balance of $5,000,000 in such account at the beginning of such fiscal year.
<br>(h) Reports
<br>
<br>Each year the Director of the Peace Corps shall submit to the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives, and to the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate, a report on funds transferred under this section.

<br>§2551. Congressional statement of purpose
<br>
<br>An ultimate goal of the United States is a world which is free from the scourge of war and the dangers and burdens of armaments; in which the use of force has been subordinated to the rule of law; and in which international adjustments to a changing world are achieved peacefully. It is the purpose of this chapter to provide impetus toward this goal by addressing the problem of reduction and control of armaments looking toward ultimate world disarmament.
<br>
<br>The Secretary of State must have the capacity to provide the essential scientific, economic, political, military, psychological, and technological information upon which realistic arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament policy must be based. The Secretary shall have the authority, under the direction of the President, to carry out the following primary functions:
<br>
<br>(1) The preparation for and management of United States participation in international negotiations and implementation fora in the arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament field.
<br>
<br>(2) The conduct, support, and coordination of research for arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament policy formulation.
<br>
<br>(3) The preparation for, operation of, or direction of, United States participation in such control systems as may become part of United States arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament activities.
<br>
<br>(4) The dissemination and coordination of public information concerning arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament.

The formulation and implementation of United States arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament policy in a manner which will promote the national security can best be insured by a central organization charged by statute with primary responsibility for this field. This organization must have such a position within the Government that it can provide the President, the Secretary of State, other officials of the executive branch, and the Congress with recommendations concerning United States arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament policy, and can assess the effect of these recommendations upon our foreign policies, our national security policies, and our economy."

(4) as (3) and struck out ", as appropriate," before "direction of", and redesignated subpar. (5) as (4).
<br>
<br>1994—Pub. L. 103–236, §719(a), inserted ", nonproliferation," after "Arms control" in second undesignated par. and after "arms control" wherever appearing in second and third undesignated pars.
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 103–236, §703, substituted subpars. (1) to (5) for former subpars. (a) to (d) which read as follows:
<br>
<br>"(a) The conduct, support, and coordination of research for arms control and disarmament policy formulation;
<br>
<br>"(b) The preparation for and management of United States participation in international negotiations in the arms control and disarmament field;
<br>
<br>"(c) The dissemination and coordination of public information concerning arms control and disarmament; and
<br>
<br>"(d) The preparation for, operation of, or as appropriate, direction of United States participation in such control systems as may become part of United States arms control and disarmament activities."

<br>
<br>"(a) It is the sense of the Congress that the recent growth in international transfers of conventional arms to developing nations—
