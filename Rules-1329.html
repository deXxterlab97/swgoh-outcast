<br>
<br>"(a) Findings.—Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>"(1) the United States has distinct legal, treaty, and trust obligations to provide for the public safety of Indian country;
<br>
<br>"(2) Congress and the President have acknowledged that—
<br>
<br>"(A) tribal law enforcement officers are often the first responders to crimes on Indian reservations; and
<br>
<br>"(B) tribal justice systems are often the most appropriate institutions for maintaining law and order in Indian country;
<br>
<br>"(3) less than 3,000 tribal and Federal law enforcement officers patrol more than 56,000,000 acres of Indian country, which reflects less than ½ of the law enforcement presence in comparable rural communities nationwide;
<br>
<br>"(4) the complicated jurisdictional scheme that exists in Indian country—
<br>
<br>"(A) has a significant negative impact on the ability to provide public safety to Indian communities;
<br>
<br>"(B) has been increasingly exploited by criminals; and
<br>
<br>"(C) requires a high degree of commitment and cooperation among tribal, Federal, and State law enforcement officials;
<br>
<br>"(5)(A) domestic and sexual violence against American Indian and Alaska Native women has reached epidemic proportions;
<br>
<br>"(B) 34 percent of American Indian and Alaska Native women will be raped in their lifetimes; and
<br>
<br>"(C) 39 percent of American Indian and Alaska Native women will be subject to domestic violence;
<br>
<br>"(6) Indian tribes have faced significant increases in instances of domestic violence, burglary, assault, and child abuse as a direct result of increased methamphetamine use on Indian reservations; and
<br>
<br>"(7) crime data is a fundamental tool of law enforcement, but for decades the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Department of Justice have not been able to coordinate or consistently report crime and prosecution rates in tribal communities.
<br>
<br>"(b) Purposes.—The purposes of this title [see Short Title of 2010 Amendment note above] are—
<br>
<br>"(1) to clarify the responsibilities of Federal, State, tribal, and local governments with respect to crimes committed in Indian country;
<br>
<br>"(2) to increase coordination and communication among Federal, State, tribal, and local law enforcement agencies;
<br>
<br>"(3) to empower tribal governments with the authority, resources, and information necessary to safely and effectively provide public safety in Indian country;
<br>
<br>"(4) to reduce the prevalence of violent crime in Indian country and to combat sexual and domestic violence against American Indian and Alaska Native women;
<br>
<br>"(5) to prevent drug trafficking and reduce rates of alcohol and drug addiction in Indian country; and
<br>
<br>"(6) to increase and standardize the collection of criminal data and the sharing of criminal history information among Federal, State, and tribal officials responsible for responding to and investigating crimes in Indian country."
