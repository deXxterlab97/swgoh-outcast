<br>"(ii) with respect to reemployment service on or after the effective date of the election, under section 8415(a) through (g) [now 8415(a)–(c), (e)–(h)] of such title, as may apply based on the reemployment in which such annuitant was engaged on or after such effective date;
<br>
<br>with the 'average pay' used in any computation under clause (i) or (ii) being determined (based on rates of pay in effect during the period of reemployment, whether before, on, or after the effective date of the election) in the same way as provided for in paragraph (6). If the annuitant is receiving a reduced annuity as provided in section 8339(j) or section 8339(k)(2) of title 5, United States Code, the increase in annuity payable under this subparagraph is reduced by 10 percent and the survivor annuity payable under section 8341(b) of such title is increased by 55 percent of the increase in annuity payable under this subparagraph, unless, at the time of claiming the increase payable under this subparagraph, the annuitant notifies the Office of Personnel Management in writing that such annuitant does not desire the survivor annuity to be increased. If the annuitant dies while still reemployed, after having been reemployed for at least 1 full year (or the equivalent thereof, in the case of part-time employment), any survivor annuity payable under section 8341(b) of such title based on the service of such annuitant is increased as though the reemployment had otherwise terminated. In applying paragraph (7) to an amount under this subparagraph, any portion of such amount attributable to clause (i) shall be adjusted under subparagraph (A) of such paragraph, and any portion of such amount attributable to clause (ii) shall be adjusted under subparagraph (B) of such paragraph.
<br>
<br>"(C)(i) If the annuitant serves on a full-time basis for at least 5 years, or on a part-time basis for periods equivalent to at least 5 years of full-time service, such annuitant may elect, instead of the benefit provided by subparagraph (B), to have such annuitant's rights redetermined, effective upon separation from employment. If the annuitant so elects, the redetermined annuity will become payable as if such annuitant were retiring for the first time based on the separation from reemployment service, and the provisions of this section concerning computation of annuity (other than any provision of this paragraph) shall apply.
<br>
<br>"(ii) If the annuitant dies while still reemployed, after having been reemployed for at least 5 full years (or the equivalent thereof, in the case of part-time employment), any person entitled to a survivor annuity under section 8341(b) of title 5, United States Code, based on the service of such annuitant shall be permitted to elect to have such person's rights redetermined in accordance with regulations which the Office shall prescribe. Redetermined benefits elected under this clause shall be in lieu of any increased benefits which would otherwise be payable in accordance with the next to last sentence of subparagraph (B).
<br>
<br>"(D) If the annuitant serves on a full-time basis for less than 1 year (or the equivalent thereof, in the case of part-time employment), any amounts withheld under section 8422(a) of title 5, United States Code, from such annuitant's pay for the period (or periods) involved shall, upon written application to the Office, be payable to such annuitant (or the appropriate survivor or survivors, determined in the order set forth in section 8342(c) of such title).
<br>
<br>"(E) For purposes of determining the period of an annuitant's reemployment service under this paragraph, a period of reemployment service shall not be taken into account unless—
<br>
<br>"(i) with respect to service performed before the effective date of the election under section 301, it is service which, if performed for at least 1 full year, would have allowed such annuitant to elect under section 8344(a) of title 5, United States Code, to have deductions withheld from pay; or
<br>
<br>"(ii) with respect to service performed on or after the effective date of the election under section 301, it is service with respect to which deductions from pay would be required to be withheld under the second sentence of section 8468(a) of title 5, United States Code.
<br>
<br>"(b) Chapter 83 Generally Inapplicable.—(1) Except as provided in subsection (a) or paragraph (2), subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code, shall not apply with respect to any individual who becomes subject to chapter 84 of title 5, United States Code, pursuant to an election under section 301.
<br>
<br>"(2)(A) Nothing in paragraph (1), or in subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code, shall preclude the making of a deposit under such subchapter with respect to any civilian service under subsection (a)(1)(D) or military service under subsection (a)(2)(B) either by the electing individual or, for purposes of survivor annuities, by a survivor of such individual.
<br>
<br>"(B) Nothing in paragraph (1) shall preclude the payment of any lump-sum credit in accordance with section 8342 of title 5, United States Code.
<br>
<br>"(c) Refunds Relating to Certain Civilian Service.—(1) Any individual who makes an election under section 301 to become subject to chapter 84 and who, with respect to any period before the effective date of the election, has made a contribution to the Civil Service Retirement System (whether by deductions from pay or by a deposit or redeposit) and has not taken a refund of the contribution (as so made), shall be entitled to a refund equal to—
<br>
<br>"(A) for a period of service under clause (i) of subsection (a)(1)(B), the amount by which—
<br>
<br>"(i) the amount contributed with respect to such period, exceeds
<br>
<br>"(ii) the amount required under such clause (i) with respect to such period;
<br>
<br>"(B) for a period of service under clause (ii) of subsection (a)(1)(B), the amount by which—
<br>
<br>"(i) the amount so contributed with respect to such period, exceeds
<br>
<br>"(ii) the amount required under such clause (ii) with respect to such period; and
<br>
<br>"(C) for a period of service under subparagraph (C) of subsection (a)(1), the amount by which—
<br>
<br>"(i) the amount so contributed with respect to such period, exceeds
<br>
<br>"(ii) the amount required under such subparagraph with respect to such period.
<br>
<br>"(2) In accordance with regulations prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management, a refund under this subsection shall be payable upon written application therefor filed with the Office and shall include interest at the rate provided in section 8334(e)(3) of title 5, United States Code. Interest on the refund shall accrue monthly and shall be compounded annually.

<br>(2) 1/260 of a year for each day on which he performed service as a Commissioner after June 30, 1945.
<br>
<br>Credit for service performed as Commissioner may not exceed 313 days in a year before July 1, 1945, or 260 days in a year after June 30, 1945. For the purpose of this subchapter, the employment and pay of a Commissioner is deemed on a daily basis when actually employed.

If the military service or service as a volunteer under part A of title VIII of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, as a full-time volunteer enrolled in a program of at least 1 year's duration under part A, B,2 or C of title I of the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973, or as a volunteer or volunteer leader under chapter 34 of title 22 is not excluded by the preceding sentence, but on becoming 62 years of age, the individual or spouse, former spouse 4 becomes entitled, or would on proper application be entitled, to the described benefits, the Office of Personnel Management shall redetermine the aggregate period of service on which the annuity is based, effective as of the first day of the month in which he or she becomes 62 years of age, so as to exclude that service. The Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, on request of the Office, shall inform the Office whether or not the individual, spouse, former spouse, or child is entitled at any named time to the described benefits. For the purpose of this subsection, the period of an individual's service as a volunteer or volunteer leader under chapter 34 of title 22 is the period between enrollment as a volunteer or volunteer leader and termination of that service by the President or by death or resignation, and the period of an individual's service as a volunteer under part A of title VIII of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 or under part A, B,2 or C of title I of the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973 is the period between enrollment as a volunteer and termination of that service by the Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity or the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation for National and Community Service, as appropriate, or by death or resignation.
<br>
<br>(2) The provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection relating to credit for military service shall not apply to—
<br>
<br>(A) any period of military service of an employee or Member with respect to which the employee or Member has made a deposit with interest, if any, under section 8334(j) of this title; or
<br>
<br>(B) the service of any employee or Member described in section 8332(c)(1)(B) of this title.

<br>
<br>In subsection (c)(1)(B), the words "as that term is defined by section 301 of title 38" are coextensive with and substituted for "as that term is used in chapter 11 of Title 38".
<br>
<br>In subsection (c)(2), the words "under chapter 67 of title 10" are substituted for "title III of Public Law 810, Eightieth Congress" on authority of the Act of Aug. 10, 1956, ch. 104, §49(b), 70A Stat. 640.
<br>
<br>In subsection (f), the words "without pay" are added after "leaves of absence" in the first sentence for clarity and to align it with the use of the term in the second sentence. The words "postal field service" are coextensive with and substituted for "postal service".

<br>
<br>In subsection (j), the words "or section 2504(f) of Title 22" are omitted as unnecessary since the provisions of that section applicable to this subchapter are carried into subsection (b). The last sentence is added on authority of section 2522(e) of title 22.
