<br>
<br>"(1) The American credit union movement began as a cooperative effort to serve the productive and provident credit needs of individuals of modest means.
<br>
<br>"(2) Credit unions continue to fulfill this public purpose, and current members and membership groups should not face divestiture from the financial services institution of their choice as a result of recent court action.
<br>
<br>"(3) To promote thrift and credit extension, a meaningful affinity and bond among members, manifested by a commonality of routine interaction, shared and related work experiences, interests, or activities, or the maintenance of an otherwise well-understood sense of cohesion or identity is essential to the fulfillment of the public mission of credit unions.
<br>
<br>"(4) Credit unions, unlike many other participants in the financial services market, are exempt from Federal and most State taxes because they are member-owned, democratically operated, not-for-profit organizations generally managed by volunteer boards of directors and because they have the specified mission of meeting the credit and savings needs of consumers, especially persons of modest means.
<br>
<br>"(5) Improved credit union safety and soundness provisions will enhance the public benefit that citizens receive from these cooperative financial services institutions."

<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13816. Revising the Seal for the National Credit Union Administration
<br>
<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13816, Dec. 8, 2017, 82 F.R. 58701, provided:
<br>
<br>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:
<br>
<br>Section 1. Revision. (a) The National Credit Union Administration Board has caused to be made, and has recommended approval of, a new seal of office for the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), the design of which accompanies and is hereby made a part of this order [not set out in the Code], and which is described as follows:
<br>
<br>(i) The eagle overlaid by the shield conveys the NCUA's role as an agency of the Federal Government. The text, "NCUA," in white on a blue background on the crest of the shield is the core of the sign that federally insured credit unions are required to display.
<br>
<br>(ii) The three stars above the eagle represent the NCUA's three-member Board, appointed by the President of the United States by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.
<br>
<br>(iii) The oak branch the eagle is holding in its left talon symbolizes the NCUA's strength, honor, and longevity in carrying out its mission of promoting confidence in the national system of cooperative credit.
<br>
<br>(iv) The olive branch the eagle is holding in its right talon symbolizes the peace and prosperity facilitated by the economic growth and access to affordable financial services that the Nation's credit unions have long provided to millions of Americans.
<br>
<br>(v) The upper portion of the circle that forms the border of the seal sets forth the agency's title, "National Credit Union Administration." The date "1934" in the lower portion of the circle reflects the creation of the Federal credit union system by the Congress in 1934 and the long unbroken line of Federal credit union regulation that evolved into the NCUA.
<br>
<br>(b) This seal is of suitable design and appropriate for adoption as the official seal of the NCUA.
<br>
<br>(c) I hereby approve this seal as the official seal of the NCUA.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. Revocation. Executive Order 11580 of January 20, 1971 (Establishing a Seal for the National Credit Union Administration), as amended, is hereby revoked.
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
<br>
<br>(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or
<br>
<br>(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
<br>
<br>(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
<br>
<br>(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
<br>
<br>Donald J. Trump.

<br>
<br>A Federal credit union shall have succession in its corporate name during its existence and shall have power—
<br>
<br>(1) to make contracts;
<br>
<br>(2) to sue and be sued;
<br>
<br>(3) to adopt and use a common seal and alter the same at pleasure;
<br>
<br>(4) to purchase, hold, and dispose of property necessary or incidental to its operations;
<br>
<br>(5) to make loans, the maturities of which shall not exceed 15 years, except as otherwise provided herein, and extend lines of credit to its members, to other credit unions, and to credit union organizations and to participate with other credit unions, credit union organizations, or financial organizations in making loans to credit union members in accordance with the following:
<br>
<br>(A) Loans to members shall be made in conformity with criteria established by the board of directors: Provided, That—
<br>
<br>(i) a residential real estate loan on a one-to-four-family dwelling, including an individual cooperative unit, that is or will be the principal residence of a credit union member, and which is secured by a first lien upon such dwelling, may have a maturity not exceeding thirty years or such other limits as shall be set by the National Credit Union Administration Board (except that a loan on an individual cooperative unit shall be adequately secured as defined by the Board), subject to the rules and regulations of the Board;
<br>
<br>(ii) a loan to finance the purchase of a mobile home, which shall be secured by a first lien on such mobile home, to be used by the credit union member as his residence, a loan for the repair, alteration, or improvement of a residential dwelling which is the residence of a credit union member, or a second mortgage loan secured by a residential dwelling which is the residence of a credit union member, shall have a maturity not to exceed 15 years or any longer term which the Board may allow;
<br>
<br>(iii) a loan secured by the insurance or guarantee of, or with advance commitment to purchase the loan by, the Federal Government, a State government, or any agency of either may be made for the maturity and under the terms and conditions specified in the law under which such insurance, guarantee, or commitment is provided;
<br>
<br>(iv) a loan or aggregate of loans to a director or member of the supervisory or credit committee of the credit union making the loan which exceeds $20,000 plus pledged shares, be approved by the board of directors;
<br>
<br>(v) loans to other members for which directors or members of the supervisory or credit committee act as guarantor or endorser be approved by the board of directors when such loans standing alone or when added to any outstanding loan or loans of the guarantor or endorser exceeds $20,000;
<br>
<br>(vi) the rate of interest may not exceed 15 per centum per annum on the unpaid balance inclusive of all finance charges, except that the Board may establish—
<br>
<br>(I) after consultation with the appropriate committees of the Congress, the Department of Treasury, and the Federal financial institution regulatory agencies, an interest rate ceiling exceeding such 15 per centum per annum rate, for periods not to exceed 18 months, if it determines that money market interest rates have risen over the preceding six-month period and that prevailing interest rate levels threaten the safety and soundness of individual credit unions as evidenced by adverse trends in liquidity, capital, earnings, and growth; and
<br>
<br>(II) a higher interest rate ceiling for Agent members of the Central Liquidity Facility in carrying out the provisions of subchapter III for such periods as the Board may authorize;
<br>
<br>(vii) the taking, receiving, reserving, or charging of a rate of interest greater than is allowed by this paragraph, when knowingly done, shall be deemed a forfeiture of the entire interest which the note, bill, or other evidence of debt carries with it, or which has been agreed to be paid thereon. If such greater rate of interest has been paid, the person by whom it has been paid, or his legal representatives, may recover back from the credit union taking or receiving the same, in an action in the nature of an action of debt, the entire amount of interest paid; but such action must be commenced within two years from the time the usurious collection was made;
<br>
<br>(viii) a borrower may repay his loan, prior to maturity in whole or in part on any business day without penalty, except that on a first or second mortgage loan a Federal credit union may require that any partial prepayments (I) be made on the date monthly installments are due, and (II) be in the amount of that part of one or more monthly installments which would be applicable to principal;
<br>
<br>(ix) loans shall be paid or amortized in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the Board after taking into account the needs or conditions of the borrowers, the amounts and duration of the loans, the interests of the members and the credit unions, and such other factors as the Board deems relevant; 1
<br>
<br>(x) loans must be approved by the credit committee or a loan officer, but no loan may be made to any member if, upon the making of that loan, the member would be indebted to the Federal credit union upon loans made to him in an aggregate amount which would exceed 10 per centum of the credit union's unimpaired capital and surplus.
<br>
<br>(B) A self-replenishing line of credit to a borrower may be established to a stated maximum amount on certain terms and conditions which may be different from the terms and conditions established for another borrower.
<br>
<br>(C) Loans to other credit unions shall be approved by the board of directors.
<br>
<br>(D) Loans to credit union organizations shall be approved by the board of directors and shall not exceed 1 per centum of the paid-in and unimpaired capital and surplus of the credit union.

<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>On and after August 7, 1998, no insured credit union may make any member business loan that would result in a total amount of such loans outstanding at that credit union at any one time equal to more than the lesser of—
<br>
<br>(1) 1.75 times the actual net worth of the credit union; or
<br>
<br>(2) 1.75 times the minimum net worth required under section 1790d(c)(1)(A) of this title for a credit union to be well capitalized.
<br>(b) Exceptions
<br>
<br>Subsection (a) does not apply in the case of—
<br>
<br>(1) an insured credit union chartered for the purpose of making, or that has a history of primarily making, member business loans to its members, as determined by the Board; or
<br>
<br>(2) an insured credit union that—
<br>
<br>(A) serves predominantly low-income members, as defined by the Board; or
<br>
<br>(B) is a community development financial institution, as defined in section 4702 of this title.

<br>
<br>As used in this section—

<br>
<br>(ii) that is fully secured by shares in the credit union making the extension of credit or deposits in other financial institutions;
<br>
<br>(iii) that is described in subparagraph (A), if it was made to a borrower or an associated member that has a total of all such extensions of credit in an amount equal to less than $50,000;

<br>(iv) the repayment of which is fully insured or fully guaranteed by, or where there is an advance commitment to purchase in full by, any agency of the Federal Government or of a State, or any political subdivision thereof; or
<br>
<br>(v) that is granted by a corporate credit union (as that term is defined by the Board) to another credit union.
<br>
<br>(2) the term "net worth"—
<br>
<br>(A) with respect to any insured credit union, means the credit union's retained earnings balance, as determined under generally accepted accounting principles; and

<br>
<br>(i) uninsured; and

<br>§1759. Membership
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>Subject to subsection (b), Federal credit union membership shall consist of the incorporators and such other persons and incorporated and unincorporated organizations, to the extent permitted by rules and regulations prescribed by the Board, as may be elected to membership and as such shall each, subscribe to at least one share of its stock and pay the initial installment thereon and a uniform entrance fee if required by the board of directors. Shares may be issued in joint tenancy with right of survivorship with any persons designated by the credit union member, but no joint tenant shall be permitted to vote, obtain loans, or hold office, unless he is within the field of membership and is a qualified member.
<br>(b) Membership field
<br>
<br>Subject to the other provisions of this section, the membership of any Federal credit union shall be limited to the membership described in one of the following categories:
<br>(1) Single common-bond credit union
<br>
<br>One group that has a common bond of occupation or association.
<br>(2) Multiple common-bond credit union
<br>
<br>More than one group—
<br>
<br>(A) each of which has (within the group) a common bond of occupation or association; and
<br>
<br>(B) the number of members, each of which (at the time the group is first included within the field of membership of a credit union described in this paragraph) does not exceed any numerical limitation applicable under subsection (d).
<br>(3) Community credit union
<br>
<br>Persons or organizations within a well-defined local community, neighborhood, or rural district.
<br>(c) Exceptions
<br>(1) Grandfathered members and groups
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding subsection (b)—
<br>
<br>(i) any person or organization that is a member of any Federal credit union as of August 7, 1998, may remain a member of the credit union after August 7, 1998; and
<br>
<br>(ii) a member of any group whose members constituted a portion of the membership of any Federal credit union as of August 7, 1998, shall continue to be eligible to become a member of that credit union, by virtue of membership in that group, after August 7, 1998.
<br>(B) Successors
<br>
<br>If the common bond of any group referred to in subparagraph (A) is defined by any particular organization or business entity, subparagraph (A) shall continue to apply with respect to any successor to the organization or entity.
<br>(2) Exception for underserved areas
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding subsection (b), in the case of a Federal credit union, the field of membership category of which is described in subsection (b)(2), the Board may allow the membership of the credit union to include any person or organization within a local community, neighborhood, or rural district if—
<br>
<br>(A) the Board determines that the local community, neighborhood, or rural district—
<br>
<br>(i) is an "investment area", as defined in section 4702(16) of this title, and meets such additional requirements as the Board may impose; and
<br>
<br>(ii) is underserved, based on data of the Board and the Federal banking agencies (as defined in section 1813 of this title), by other depository institutions (as defined in section 461(b)(1)(A) of this title); and
<br>
<br>(B) the credit union establishes and maintains an office or facility in the local community, neighborhood, or rural district at which credit union services are available.
<br>(d) Multiple common-bond credit union group requirements
<br>(1) Numerical limitation
<br>
<br>Except as provided in paragraph (2), only a group with fewer than 3,000 members shall be eligible to be included in the field of membership category of a credit union described in subsection (b)(2).
<br>(2) Exceptions
<br>
<br>In the case of any Federal credit union, the field of membership category of which is described in subsection (b)(2), the numerical limitation in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not apply with respect to—
<br>
<br>(A) any group that the Board determines, in writing and in accordance with the guidelines and regulations issued under paragraph (3), could not feasibly or reasonably establish a new single common-bond credit union, the field of membership category of which is described in subsection (b)(1) because—
<br>
<br>(i) the group lacks sufficient volunteer and other resources to support the efficient and effective operation of a credit union;
<br>
<br>(ii) the group does not meet the criteria that the Board has determined to be important for the likelihood of success in establishing and managing a new credit union, including demographic characteristics such as geographical location of members, diversity of ages and income levels, and other factors that may affect the financial viability and stability of a credit union; or
<br>
<br>(iii) the group would be unlikely to operate a safe and sound credit union;
<br>
<br>(B) any group transferred from another credit union—
<br>
<br>(i) in connection with a merger or consolidation recommended by the Board or any appropriate State credit union supervisor based on safety and soundness concerns with respect to that other credit union; or
<br>
<br>(ii) by the Board in the Board's capacity as conservator or liquidating agent with respect to that other credit union; or
<br>
<br>(C) any group transferred in connection with a voluntary merger, having received conditional approval by the Administration of the merger application prior to October 25, 1996, but not having consummated the merger prior to October 25, 1996, if the merger is consummated not later than 180 days after August 7, 1998.
<br>(3) Regulations and guidelines
<br>
<br>The Board shall issue guidelines or regulations, after notice and opportunity for comment, setting forth the criteria that the Board will apply in determining under this subsection whether or not an additional group may be included within the field of membership category of an existing credit union described in subsection (b)(2).
<br>(e) Additional membership eligibility provisions
<br>(1) Membership eligibility limited to immediate family or household members
<br>
<br>No individual shall be eligible for membership in a credit union on the basis of the relationship of the individual to another person who is eligible for membership in the credit union, unless the individual is a member of the immediate family or household (as those terms are defined by the Board, by regulation) of the other person.
<br>(2) Retention of membership
<br>
<br>Except as provided in section 1764 of this title, once a person becomes a member of a credit union in accordance with this subchapter, that person or organization may remain a member of that credit union until the person or organization chooses to withdraw from the membership of the credit union.
<br>(f) Criteria for approval of expansion of multiple common-bond credit unions
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Board shall—
<br>
<br>(A) encourage the formation of separately chartered credit unions instead of approving an application to include an additional group within the field of membership of an existing credit union whenever practicable and consistent with reasonable standards for the safe and sound operation of the credit union; and
<br>
<br>(B) if the formation of a separate credit union by the group is not practicable or consistent with the standards referred to in subparagraph (A), require the inclusion of the group in the field of membership of a credit union that is within reasonable proximity to the location of the group whenever practicable and consistent with reasonable standards for the safe and sound operation of the credit union.
<br>(2) Approval criteria
<br>
<br>The Board may not approve any application by a Federal credit union, the field of membership category of which is described in subsection (b)(2) to include any additional group within the field of membership of the credit union (or an application by a Federal credit union described in subsection (b)(1) to include an additional group and become a credit union described in subsection (b)(2)), unless the Board determines, in writing, that—
<br>
<br>(A) the credit union has not engaged in any unsafe or unsound practice (as defined in section 1786(b) of this title) that is material during the 1-year period preceding the date of filing of the application;
<br>
<br>(B) the credit union is adequately capitalized;
<br>
<br>(C) the credit union has the administrative capability to serve the proposed membership group and the financial resources to meet the need for additional staff and assets to serve the new membership group;
<br>
<br>(D) any potential harm that the expansion of the field of membership of the credit union may have on any other insured credit union and its members is clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable beneficial effect of the expansion in meeting the convenience and needs of the members of the group proposed to be included in the field of membership; and
<br>
<br>(E) the credit union has met such additional requirements as the Board may prescribe, by regulation.
<br>(g) Regulations required for community credit unions
<br>(1) Definition of well-defined local community, neighborhood, or rural district
<br>
<br>The Board shall prescribe, by regulation, a definition for the term "well-defined local community, neighborhood, or rural district" for purposes of—
<br>
<br>(A) making any determination with regard to the field of membership of a credit union described in subsection (b)(3); and
<br>
<br>(B) establishing the criteria applicable with respect to any such determination.
<br>(2) Scope of application
<br>
<br>The definition prescribed by the Board under paragraph (1) shall apply with respect to any application to form a new credit union, or to alter or expand the field of membership of an existing credit union, that is filed with the Board after August 7, 1998.
