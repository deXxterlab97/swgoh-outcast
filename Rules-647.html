<br>§9011. Subsidy for certain loan payments
<br>(a) Definition of covered loan
<br>
<br>In this section, the term "covered loan" means a loan that is—
<br>
<br>(1) guaranteed by the Administration under—
<br>
<br>(A) section 636(a) of this title—
<br>
<br>(i) including a loan made under the Community Advantage Pilot Program of the Administration; and
<br>
<br>(ii) excluding a loan made under paragraph (36) of such section 636(a) of this title, as added by section 1102; or
<br>
<br>(B) title V of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 (15 U.S.C. 695 et seq.); or
<br>
<br>(2) made by an intermediary to a small business concern using loans or grants received under section 636(m) of this title.
<br>(b) Sense of Congress
<br>
<br>It is the sense of Congress that—
<br>
<br>(1) all borrowers are adversely affected by COVID–19;
<br>
<br>(2) relief payments by the Administration are appropriate for all borrowers; and
<br>
<br>(3) in addition to the relief provided under this Act, the Administration should encourage lenders to provide payment deferments, when appropriate, and to extend the maturity of covered loans, so as to avoid balloon payments or any requirement for increases in debt payments resulting from deferments provided by lenders during the period of the national emergency declared by the President under the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) with respect to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID–19).
<br>(c) Principal and interest payments
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Subject to the other provisions of this section, the Administrator shall pay the principal, interest, and any associated fees that are owed on a covered loan in a regular servicing status, without regard to the date on which the covered loan is fully disbursed, and subject to availability of funds, as follows:
<br>
<br>(A) With respect to a covered loan made before March 27, 2020, and not on deferment, the Administrator shall make those payments as follows:
<br>
<br>(i) The Administrator shall make those payments for the 6-month period beginning with the next payment due on the covered loan.
<br>
<br>(ii) In addition to the payments under clause (i)—

<br>(I) with respect to a covered loan other than a covered loan described in paragraph (1)(A)(i) or (2) of subsection (a), the Administrator shall make those payments for—
<br>
<br>(aa) the 3-month period beginning with the first payment due on the covered loan on or after February 1, 2021; and
<br>
<br>(bb) an additional 5-month period immediately following the end of the 3-month period provided under item (aa) if the covered loan is made to a borrower that, according to records of the Administration, is assigned a North American Industry Classification System code beginning with 61, 71, 72, 213, 315, 448, 451, 481, 485, 487, 511, 512, 515, 532, or 812; and

<br>
<br>No single monthly payment of principal, interest, and associated fees made by the Administrator under subparagraph (A)(ii), (B)(ii), or (D) of paragraph (1) with respect to a covered loan may be in a total amount that is more than $9,000.
<br>(B) Treatment of additional amounts owed
<br>
<br>If, for a month, the total amount of principal, interest, and associated fees that are owed on a covered loan for which the Administration makes payments under paragraph (1) is more than $9,000 the Administrator may require the lender with respect to the covered loan to add the amount by which those costs exceed $9,000 for that month as interest to be paid by the borrower with respect to the covered loan at the end of the loan period.
<br>(5) Additional provisions for new loans
<br>
<br>With respect to a loan described in paragraph (1)(C)—
<br>
<br>(A) the Administrator may further extend the period described in paragraph (1)(C) if there are sufficient funds to continue those payments; and
<br>

<br>(6) Eligibility
<br>
<br>Eligibility for a covered loan to receive such payments of principal, interest, and any associated fees under this subsection shall be based on the date on which the covered loan is approved by the Administration.

<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The Administrator shall monitor whether amounts made available to make payments under this subsection are sufficient to make the payments for the periods described in paragraph (1).
<br>(B) Plan
<br>
<br>If the Administrator determines under subparagraph (A) that the amounts made available to make payments under this subsection are insufficient, the Administrator shall—
<br>
<br>(i) develop a plan to proportionally reduce the number of months provided for each period described in paragraph (1), while ensuring all amounts made available to make payments under this subsection are fully expended; and
<br>
<br>(ii) before taking action under the plan developed under clause (i), submit to Congress a report regarding the plan, which shall include the data that informs the plan.
<br>(8) Additional requirements
<br>
<br>With respect to the payments made under this subsection—
<br>

<br>
<br>The Administrator shall—

<br>
<br>(3) when necessary to provide more time because of the potential of higher volumes, travel restrictions, and the inability to access some properties during the COVID–19 pandemic, extend lender site visit requirements to—
<br>
<br>(A) not more than 60 days (which may be extended at the discretion of the Administration) after the occurrence of an adverse event, other than a payment default, causing a loan to be classified as in liquidation; and
<br>
<br>(B) not more than 90 days after a payment default.
<br>(e) Rule of construction
<br>
<br>Nothing in this section may be construed to limit the authority of the Administrator to make payments pursuant to subsection (c) with respect to a covered loan solely because the covered loan has been sold in the secondary market.
<br>(f) Eligibility for new loans
<br>
<br>For each individual lending program under this section, the Administrator may establish a minimum loan maturity period, taking into consideration the normal underwriting requirements for each such program, with the goal of preventing abuse under the program.
<br>(g) Limitation on assistance
<br>
<br>A borrower may not receive assistance under subsection (c) for more than 1 covered loan of the borrower described in paragraph (1)(C) of that subsection.

<br>(3) Education and outreach
<br>
<br>The Administrator shall provide education, outreach, and communication to lenders, borrowers, district offices, and resource partners of the Administration in order to ensure full and proper compliance with this section, encourage broad participation with respect to covered loans that have not yet been approved by the Administrator, and help lenders transition borrowers from subsidy payments under this section directly to a deferral when suitable for the borrower.
<br>(4) Notification
<br>

<br>An agreement under this section shall not apply (or shall cease to apply) with respect to a State upon a determination by the Secretary that the method governing the computation of regular compensation under the State law of that State has been modified in a manner such that the number of weeks (the maximum benefit entitlement), or the average weekly benefit amount, of regular compensation which will be payable during the period of the agreement (determined disregarding any Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation or Mixed Earner Unemployment Compensation) will be less than the number of weeks, or the average weekly benefit amount, of the average weekly benefit amount of regular compensation which would otherwise have been payable during such period under the State law, as in effect on January 1, 2020.
<br>(2) Maximum benefit entitlement
<br>

<br>
<br>(A) the payment of such Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation or Mixed Earner Unemployment Compensation was without fault on the part of any such individual; and

<br>(B) Opportunity for hearing
<br>
<br>No repayment shall be required, and no deduction shall be made, until a determination has been made, notice thereof and an opportunity for a fair hearing has been given to the individual, and the determination has become final.

Any State which is a party to an agreement under this section may, upon providing 30 days' written notice to the Secretary, terminate such agreement.
<br>(b) Requirement that State law does not apply a waiting week
<br>
<br>A State is eligible to enter into an agreement under this section if the State law (including a waiver of State law) provides that compensation is paid to individuals for their first week of regular unemployment without a waiting week.

<br>(c) Payments to States
<br>(1) Full reimbursement
<br>

<br>
<br>(B) any additional administrative expenses incurred by the State by reason of such agreement (as determined by the Secretary).
<br>(2) Terms of payments
<br>
<br>Sums payable to any State by reason of such State's having an agreement under this section shall be payable, either in advance or by way of reimbursement (as determined by the Secretary), in such amounts as the Secretary estimates the State will be entitled to receive under this section for each calendar month, reduced or increased, as the case may be, by any amount by which the Secretary finds that his estimates for any prior calendar month were greater or less than the amounts which should have been paid to the State. Such estimates may be made on the basis of such statistical, sampling, or other method as may be agreed upon by the Secretary and the State agency of the State involved.
<br>(3) Partial reimbursement
<br>
<br>With respect to compensation paid to individuals for weeks of unemployment ending after December 31, 2020, paragraph (1) shall be applied by substituting "50 percent" for "100 percent".
<br>(d) Funding
<br>(1) Compensation
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Funds in the Federal unemployment account (as established by section 905(g)) 1 of the Unemployment Trust Fund (as established by section 904(a)) 1 shall be used to make payments under subsection (c)(1)(A).

<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of the Treasury shall transfer from the general fund of the Treasury (from funds not otherwise appropriated) to the Federal unemployment account such sums as the Secretary of Labor estimates to be necessary to make payments described in subparagraph (A). There are appropriated from the general fund of the Treasury, without fiscal year limitation, the sums referred to in the preceding sentence and such sums shall not be required to be repaid.

<br>
<br>Funds in the employment security administration account (as established by section 1101(a) of title 42) of the Unemployment Trust Fund (as established by section 1104(a) of title 42) shall be used to make payments to States pursuant to subsection (c)(1)(B).

<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of the Treasury shall transfer from the general fund of the Treasury (from funds not otherwise appropriated) to the employment security administration account such sums as the Secretary of Labor estimates to be necessary to make payments described in subparagraph (A). There are appropriated from the general fund of the Treasury, without fiscal year limitation, the sums referred to in the preceding sentence and such sums shall not be required to be repaid.
<br>(3) Certifications
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall from time to time certify to the Secretary of the Treasury for payment to each State the sums payable to such State under this section.
<br>(e) Applicability
<br>
<br>An agreement entered into under this section shall apply to weeks of unemployment—
<br>
<br>(1) beginning after the date on which such agreement is entered into; and
<br>
<br>(2) ending on or before March 14, 2021.
<br>(f) Fraud and overpayments
<br>
<br>The provisions of section 9025(e) of this title shall apply with respect to compensation paid under an agreement under this section to the same extent and in the same manner as in the case of pandemic emergency unemployment compensation under such section.
<br>(g) Definitions
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, the terms "regular compensation", "State", "State agency", "State law", and "week" have the respective meanings given such terms under section 205 of the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 (26 U.S.C. 3304 note).
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 116–136, div. A, title II, §2105, Mar. 27, 2020, 134 Stat. 321; Pub. L. 116–260, div. N, title II, §204, Dec. 27, 2020, 134 Stat. 1953.)
<br>References in Text
<br>
<br>Section 905(g) and section 904(a), referred to in subsec. (d)(1)(A), probably mean sections 905(g) and 904(a) of the Social Security Act. However, section 905(g) probably should be a reference to section 904(g) as there is no subsec. (g) in section 905 of the Act, and section 904(g) establishes the Federal unemployment account. Section 904(a) and (g) is classified to section 1104(a) and (g), respectively, of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare.
<br>
<br>Section 205 of the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970, referred to in subsec. (g), is section 205 of Pub. L. 91–373, which is set out in a note under section 3304 of Title 26, Internal Revenue Code.
<br>Amendments
<br>
<br>2020—Subsec. (c)(1). Pub. L. 116–260, §204(1)(A), substituted "Except as provided in paragraph (3), there shall be paid" for "There shall be paid" in introductory provisions.
<br>
<br>Subsec. (c)(3). Pub. L. 116–260, §204(1)(B), added par. (3).
<br>
<br>Subsec. (e)(2). Pub. L. 116–260, §204(2), substituted "March 14, 2021" for "December 31, 2020".

<br>§9025. Pandemic emergency unemployment compensation
<br>(a) Federal-State agreements
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Any State which desires to do so may enter into and participate in an agreement under this section with the Secretary of Labor (in this section referred to as the "Secretary"). Any State which is a party to an agreement under this section may, upon providing 30 days' written notice to the Secretary, terminate such agreement.
<br>(2) Provisions of agreement
<br>
<br>Any agreement under paragraph (1) shall provide that the State agency of the State will make payments of pandemic emergency unemployment compensation to individuals who—
<br>
<br>(A) have exhausted all rights to regular compensation under the State law or under Federal law with respect to a benefit year (excluding any benefit year that ended before July 1, 2019);
<br>
<br>(B) have no rights to regular compensation with respect to a week under such law or any other State unemployment compensation law or to compensation under any other Federal law;
<br>
<br>(C) are not receiving compensation with respect to such week under the unemployment compensation law of Canada; and
<br>
<br>(D) are able to work, available to work, and actively seeking work.
<br>(3) Exhaustion of benefits
<br>
<br>For purposes of paragraph (2)(A), an individual shall be deemed to have exhausted such individual's rights to regular compensation under a State law when—
<br>
<br>(A) no payments of regular compensation can be made under such law because such individual has received all regular compensation available to such individual based on employment or wages during such individual's base period; or
<br>
<br>(B) such individual's rights to such compensation have been terminated by reason of the expiration of the benefit year with respect to which such rights existed.
<br>(4) Weekly benefit amount, etc.
<br>
<br>For purposes of any agreement under this section—
<br>
<br>(A) the amount of pandemic emergency unemployment compensation which shall be payable to any individual for any week of total unemployment shall be equal to—
<br>
<br>(i) the amount of the regular compensation (including dependents' allowances) payable to such individual during such individual's benefit year under the State law for a week of total unemployment;
<br>
<br>(ii) the amount of Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation under section 9023(b)(1)(B) of this title; and
<br>
<br>(iii) the amount (if any) of Mixed Earner Unemployment Compensation under section 9023(b)(1)(C) of this title;
<br>
<br>(B) the terms and conditions of the State law which apply to claims for regular compensation and to the payment thereof (including terms and conditions relating to availability for work, active search for work, and refusal to accept work) shall apply to claims for pandemic emergency unemployment compensation and the payment thereof, except where otherwise inconsistent with the provisions of this section or with the regulations or operating instructions of the Secretary promulgated to carry out this section;
<br>
<br>(C) the maximum amount of pandemic emergency unemployment compensation payable to any individual for whom an 1 pandemic emergency unemployment compensation account is established under subsection (b) shall not exceed the amount established in such account for such individual; and
<br>
<br>(D) the allowable methods of payment under section 9023(b)(2) of this title shall apply to payments of amounts described in subparagraph (A)(ii).
<br>(5) Coordination rules
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Subject to subparagraph (B), an agreement under this section shall apply with respect to a State only upon a determination by the Secretary that, under the State law or other applicable rules of such State, the payment of extended compensation for which an individual is otherwise eligible must be deferred until after the payment of any pandemic emergency unemployment compensation under subsection (b) for which the individual is concurrently eligible.
<br>(B) Special rule
<br>
<br>In the case of an individual who is receiving extended compensation under the State law for the week that includes December 27, 2020 (without regard to the amendments made by subsections (a) and (b) of section 206 of the Continued Assistance for Unemployed Workers Act of 2020), such individual shall not be eligible to receive pandemic emergency unemployment compensation by reason of such amendments until such individual has exhausted all rights to such extended benefits.
<br>(6) Nonreduction rule
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>An agreement under this section shall not apply (or shall cease to apply) with respect to a State upon a determination by the Secretary that the method governing the computation of regular compensation under the State law of that State has been modified in a manner such that the number of weeks (the maximum benefit entitlement), or the average weekly benefit amount, of regular compensation which will be payable during the period of the agreement will be less than the number of weeks, or the average weekly benefit amount, of the average weekly benefit amount of regular compensation which would otherwise have been payable during such period under the State law, as in effect on January 1, 2020.
<br>(B) Maximum benefit entitlement
<br>
<br>In subparagraph (A), the term "maximum benefit entitlement" means the amount of regular unemployment compensation payable to an individual with respect to the individual's benefit year.
<br>(7) Actively seeking work
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Subject to subparagraph (C),2 for purposes of paragraph (2)(D), the term "actively seeking work" means, with respect to any individual, that such individual—
<br>
<br>(i) is registered for employment services in such a manner and to such extent as prescribed by the State agency;
<br>
<br>(ii) has engaged in an active search for employment that is appropriate in light of the employment available in the labor market, the individual's skills and capabilities, and includes a number of employer contacts that is consistent with the standards communicated to the individual by the State;
<br>
<br>(iii) has maintained a record of such work search, including employers contacted, method of contact, and date contacted; and
<br>
<br>(iv) when requested, has provided such work search record to the State agency.
<br>(B) Flexibility
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding the requirements under subparagraph (A) and paragraph (2)(D), a State shall provide flexibility in meeting such requirements in case of individuals unable to search for work because of COVID–19, including because of illness, quarantine, or movement restriction.
<br>(8) Special rule for extended compensation
<br>
<br>At the option of a State, for any weeks of unemployment beginning after December 27, 2020, and before April 12, 2021, an individual's eligibility period (as described in section 203(c) of the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 (26 U.S.C. 3304 note)) shall, for purposes of any determination of eligibility for extended compensation under the State law of such State, be considered to include any week which begins—
<br>
<br>(A) after the date as of which such individual exhausts all rights to pandemic emergency unemployment compensation; and
<br>
<br>(B) during an extended benefit period that began on or before the date described in subparagraph (A).
<br>(b) Pandemic emergency unemployment compensation account
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Any agreement under this section shall provide that the State will establish, for each eligible individual who files an application for pandemic emergency unemployment compensation, an 1 pandemic emergency unemployment compensation account with respect to such individual's benefit year.
<br>(2) Amount in account
<br>
<br>The amount established in an account under subsection (a) shall be equal to 24 times the individual's average weekly benefit amount, which includes the amount of Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation under section 9023 of this title, for the benefit year.
<br>(3) Weekly benefit amount
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subsection, an individual's weekly benefit amount for any week is the amount of regular compensation (including dependents' allowances) under the State law payable to such individual for such week for total unemployment plus the amount of Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation under section 9023 of this title.
<br>(4) Coordination of pandemic emergency unemployment compensation with regular compensation
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>If—
<br>
<br>(i) an individual has been determined to be entitled to pandemic emergency unemployment compensation with respect to a benefit year;
<br>
<br>(ii) that benefit year has expired;
<br>
<br>(iii) that individual has remaining entitlement to pandemic emergency unemployment compensation with respect to that benefit year; and
<br>
<br>(iv) that individual would qualify for a new benefit year in which the weekly benefit amount of regular compensation is at least $25 less than the individual's weekly benefit amount in the benefit year referred to in clause (i),
<br>
<br>then the State shall determine eligibility for compensation as provided in subparagraph (B).
<br>(B) Determination of eligibility
<br>
<br>For individuals described in subparagraph (A), the State shall determine whether the individual is to be paid pandemic emergency unemployment compensation or regular compensation for a week of unemployment using one of the following methods:
<br>
<br>(i) The State shall, if permitted by State law, establish a new benefit year, but defer the payment of regular compensation with respect to that new benefit year until exhaustion of all pandemic emergency unemployment compensation payable with respect to the benefit year referred to in subparagraph (A)(i).
<br>
<br>(ii) The State shall, if permitted by State law, defer the establishment of a new benefit year (which uses all the wages and employment which would have been used to establish a benefit year but for the application of this subparagraph), until exhaustion of all pandemic emergency unemployment compensation payable with respect to the benefit year referred to in subparagraph (A)(i).
<br>
<br>(iii) The State shall pay, if permitted by State law—
<br>
<br>(I) regular compensation equal to the weekly benefit amount established under the new benefit year; and
<br>
<br>(II) pandemic emergency unemployment compensation equal to the difference between that weekly benefit amount and the weekly benefit amount for the expired benefit year.
<br>
<br>(iv) The State shall determine rights to pandemic emergency unemployment compensation without regard to any rights to regular compensation if the individual elects to not file a claim for regular compensation under the new benefit year.
<br>(c) Payments to States having agreements for the payment of pandemic emergency unemployment compensation
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>There shall be paid to each State that has entered into an agreement under this section an amount equal to 100 percent of the pandemic emergency unemployment compensation paid to individuals by the State pursuant to such agreement.

<br>
<br>No payment shall be made to any State under this section in respect of any compensation to the extent the State is entitled to reimbursement in respect of such compensation under the provisions of any Federal law other than this section or chapter 85 of title 5. A State shall not be entitled to any reimbursement under such chapter 85 in respect of any compensation to the extent the State is entitled to reimbursement under this section in respect of such compensation.
<br>(3) Determination of amount
<br>
<br>Sums payable to any State by reason of such State having an agreement under this section shall be payable, either in advance or by way of reimbursement (as may be determined by the Secretary), in such amounts as the Secretary estimates the State will be entitled to receive under this section for each calendar month, reduced or increased, as the case may be, by any amount by which the Secretary finds that the Secretary's estimates for any prior calendar month were greater or less than the amounts which should have been paid to the State. Such estimates may be made on the basis of such statistical, sampling, or other method as may be agreed upon by the Secretary and the State agency of the State involved.

<br>
<br>If an individual knowingly has made, or caused to be made by another, a false statement or representation of a material fact, or knowingly has failed, or caused another to fail, to disclose a material fact, and as a result of such false statement or representation or of such nondisclosure such individual has received an amount of pandemic emergency unemployment compensation under this section to which such individual was not entitled, such individual—

<br>
<br>(A) the payment of such pandemic emergency unemployment compensation was without fault on the part of any such individual; and
<br>
<br>(B) such repayment would be contrary to equity and good conscience.
<br>(3) Recovery by State agency

<br>
<br>The State agency shall recover the amount to be repaid, or any part thereof, by deductions from any pandemic emergency unemployment compensation payable to such individual under this section or from any unemployment compensation payable to such individual under any State or Federal unemployment compensation law administered by the State agency or under any other State or Federal law administered by the State agency which provides for the payment of any assistance or allowance with respect to any week of unemployment, during the 3-year period after the date such individuals received the payment of the pandemic emergency unemployment compensation to which they were not entitled, in accordance with the same procedures as apply to the recovery of overpayments of regular unemployment benefits paid by the State.
<br>(B) Opportunity for hearing
<br>
<br>No repayment shall be required, and no deduction shall be made, until a determination has been made, notice thereof and an opportunity for a fair hearing has been given to the individual, and the determination has become final.
