<br>Happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee.
<br>3Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine, in the innermost parts of thy house;
<br>Thy children like olive plants, round about thy table.
<br> 
<br>All they that hate Zion.
<br>6Let them be as the grass upon the housetops,
<br>Which withereth afore it springeth up;
<br>7Wherewith the reaper filleth not his hand,
<br>Nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom.
<br>8Neither do they that go by say: ‘The blessing of the LORD be upon
<br>you;
<br> 
<br>We bless you in the name of the LORD.'
<br> 
<br>Neither do I exercise myself in things too great, or in things too
<br>wonderful for me.
<br> 
<br>130
<br> 
<br>A Song of Ascents.
<br> 
<br>2Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul;
<br> 
<br>Out of the depths have I called Thee, O LORD.
<br>2Lord, hearken unto my voice; Let Thine ears be attentive
<br>To the voice of my supplications.
<br>
<br>3If Thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities,
<br> 
<br>Like a weaned child with his mother;
<br>My soul is with me like a weaned child.
<br>
<br>3O Israel, hope in the LORD
<br>From this time forth and for ever.
<br> 
<br>O Lord, who could stand?
<br>4For with Thee there is forgiveness,
<br> 
<br>132
<br> 
<br>A Song of Ascents.
<br> 
<br>That Thou mayest be feared.
<br>
<br>5I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait,
<br>And in His word do I hope.
<br>6My soul waiteth for the Lord,
<br>More than watchmen for the morning;
<br>Yea, more than watchmen for the morning.
<br>
<br>7O Israel, hope in the LORD;
<br>For with the LORD there is mercy,
<br>And with Him is plenteous redemption.
<br>8And He will redeem Israel From all his iniquities.
<br> 
<br>LORD, remember unto David All his affliction;
<br>2How he swore unto the LORD,
<br>And vowed unto the Mighty One of Jacob:
<br>3‘Surely I will not come into the tent of my house,
<br>Nor go up into the bed that is spread for me;
<br>4I will not give sleep to mine eyes, Nor slumber to mine eyelids; 5Until I find out a place for the
<br>LORD,
<br>A dwelling-place for the Mighty One of Jacob.'
<br>
<br>6Lo, we heard of it as being in Ephrath;
<br> 
<br>131
<br> 
<br>A Song of Ascents; of David.
<br> 
<br>We found it in the field of athe wood.
<br>7Let us go into His dwelling-place;
<br> 
<br>LORD, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty;
<br> 
<br>Let us worship at His footstool.
<br>
<br>a Heb. Joar. See 1 Chr, xiii. 5.
<br> 
<br>8Arise, O LORD, unto Thy resting- place;
<br>Thou, and the ark of Thy strength.
<br> 
<br>But upon himself shall his crown shine.'
<br> 
<br>9Let Thy priests be clothed with righteousness;
<br>And let Thy saints shout for joy.
<br> 
<br>133
<br> 
<br>A Song of Ascents; of David.
<br> 
<br>10For Thy servant David's sake Turn not away the face of Thine
<br>anointed.
<br>
<br>11The LORD swore unto David in truth;
<br>He will not turn back from it:
<br>'Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.
<br>12If thy children keep My covenant And My testimony that I shall teach
<br>them,
<br>Their children also for ever shall sit upon thy throne.'
<br>13For the LORD hath chosen Zion;
<br>He hath desired it for His habitation:
<br>14'This is My resting-place for ever;
<br> 
<br>Behold, how good and how pleasant it is
<br>For brethren to dwell together in unity!
<br>2It is like the precious oil upon the head,
<br>Coming down upon the beard; Even Aaron's beard,
<br>That cometh down upon the collar of his garments;
<br>3Like the dew of Hermon,
<br>That cometh down upon the mountains of Zion;
<br>For there the LORD commanded the blessing,
<br>Even life for ever.
<br> 
<br>Here will I dwell; for I have desired it.
<br> 
<br>134
<br> 
<br>A Song of Ascents.
<br> 
<br>15I will abundantly bless her provision;
<br>I will give her needy bread in plenty.
<br>16Her priests also will I clothe with salvation;
<br>And her saints shall shout aloud for joy.
<br>17There will I make a horn to shoot up unto David,
<br>There have I ordered a lamp for
<br> 
<br>Behold, bless ye the LORD, all ye servants of the LORD,
<br>That stand in the house of the LORD in the night seasons.
<br>2Lift up your hands to the sanctuary, And bless ye the LORD.
<br>
<br>3The LORD bless thee out of Zion;
<br>Even He that made heaven and earth.
<br> 
<br>Mine anointed.
<br>18His enemies will I clothe with shame;
<br> 
<br>135
<br> 
<br>Hallelujah.
<br>Praise ye the name of the LORD;
<br> 
<br>Give praise, O ye servants of the LORD,
<br>2Ye that stand in the house of the LORD,
<br>In the courts of the house of our God.
<br>3Praise ye the LORD, for the LORD is good;
<br>Sing praises unto His name, for it is pleasant.
<br>4For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto Himself,
<br>And Israel for His own treasure.
<br>
<br>5For I know that the LORD is great, And that our Lord is above all gods. 6Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that
<br>hath He done,
<br>In heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps;
<br>7Who causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth;
<br>He maketh lightnings for the rain; He bringeth forth the wind out of
<br>His treasuries.
<br>
<br>8Who smote the first-born of Egypt, Both of man and beast.
<br>9He sent signs and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt,
<br>Upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.
<br>
<br>10Who smote many nations, And slew mighty kings:
<br> 
<br>A heritage unto Israel His people.
<br>
<br>13O LORD, Thy name endureth for ever;
<br>Thy memorial, O LORD, throughout all generations.
<br>14For the LORD will judge His people,
<br>And repent Himself for His servants.
<br>15The idols of the nations are silver and gold,
<br>The work of men's hands.
<br>16They have mouths, but they speak not;
<br>Eyes have they, but they see not;
<br>17They have ears, but they hear not;
<br>Neither is there any breath in their mouths.
<br>18They that make them shall be like unto them;
<br>Yea, every one that trusteth in them.
<br>
<br>19O house of Israel, bless ye the LORD;
<br>O house of Aaron, bless ye the LORD;
<br>20O house of Levi, bless ye the LORD;
<br>Ye that fear the LORD, bless ye the LORD.
<br>21Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, Who dwelleth at Jerusalem.
<br>Hallelujah.
<br> 
<br>11Sihon king of the Amorites, And Og king of Bashan,
<br> 
<br>136
<br> 
<br>O give thanks unto the LORD, for He is good,
<br> 
<br>And all the kingdoms of Canaan;
<br>12And gave their land for a heritage,
<br> 
<br>For His mercy endureth for ever.
<br> 
<br>2O give thanks unto the God of gods,
<br>For His mercy endureth for ever.
<br>3O give thanks unto the Lord of lords,
<br>For His mercy endureth for ever.
<br>
<br>4To Him who alone doeth great wonders,
<br>For His mercy endureth for ever.
<br>5To Him that by understanding made the heavens, for His mercy endureth for ever.
<br>6To Him that spread forth the earth above the waters,
<br>For His mercy endureth for ever. 7To Him that made great lights, For His mercy endureth for ever; 8The sun to rule by day,
<br>For His mercy endureth for ever;
<br>9The moon and stars to rule by night,
<br>For His mercy endureth for ever.
<br>
<br>10To Him that smote Egypt in their first-born,
<br>For His mercy endureth for ever;
<br>11And brought out Israel from among them,
<br>For His mercy endureth for ever;
<br>12With a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm,
<br>For His mercy endureth for ever.
<br> 
<br>15But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red Sea,
<br>For His mercy endureth for ever.
<br>16To Him that led His people through the wilderness,
<br>For His mercy endureth for ever.
<br>
<br>17To Him that smote great kings; For His mercy endureth for ever; 18And slew mighty kings,
<br>For His mercy endureth for ever. 19Sihon king of the Amorites, For His mercy endureth for ever; 20And Og king of Bashan,
<br>For His mercy endureth for ever; 21And gave their land for a heritage, For His mercy endureth for ever; 22Even a heritage unto Israel His
<br>servant,
<br>For His mercy endureth for ever.
<br>
<br>23Who remembered us in our low estate,
<br>For His mercy endureth for ever;
<br>24And hath delivered us from our adversaries,
<br>For His mercy endureth for ever. 25Who giveth food to all flesh, For His mercy endureth for ever. 26O give thanks unto the God of
<br>heaven,
<br>For His mercy endureth for ever.
<br> 
<br>13To Him who divided the Red Sea in sunder,
<br>For His mercy endureth for ever;
<br> 
<br>137
<br> 
<br>By the rivers of Babylon,
<br>There we sat down, yea, we wept,
<br> 
<br>14And made Israel to pass through the midst of it,
<br>For His mercy endureth for ever;
<br> 
<br>When we remembered Zion.
<br>2Upon the willows in the midst thereof
<br> 
<br>We hanged up our harps.
<br>3For there they that led us captive asked of us words of song,
<br>And our tormentors asked of us mirth:
<br>‘Sing us one of the songs of Zion.' 4How shall we sing the LORD’S song In a foreign land?
<br>5If I forget thee, O Jerusalem,
<br>Let my right hand forget her cunning.
<br>6Let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth,
<br>If I remember thee not; If I set not Jerusalem Above my chiefest joy.
<br>
<br>7Remember, O LORD, against the children of Edom
<br>The day of Jerusalem; Who said: 'Rase it, rase it,
<br>Even to the foundation thereof.'
<br>8O daughter of Babylon, that art to be destroyed;
<br>Happy shall he be, that repayeth thee
<br>As thou hast served us.
<br>9Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones
<br>Against the rock.
<br> 
<br>And give thanks unto Thy name for Thy mercy and for Thy truth;
<br>For Thou hast magnified Thy word above all Thy name.
<br>3In the day that I called, Thou didst answer me;
<br>Thou didst encourage me in my soul with strength.
<br>
<br>4All the kings of the earth shall give Thee thanks, O LORD,
<br>For they have heard the words of Thy mouth.
<br>5Yea, they shall sing of the ways of the LORD;
<br>For great is the glory of the LORD.
<br>6For though the LORD be high, yet regardeth He the lowly,
<br>And the haughty He knoweth from afar.
<br>7Though I walk in the midst of trouble, Thou quickenest me;
<br>Thou stretchest forth Thy hand against the wrath of mine enemies,
<br>And Thy right hand doth save me.
<br>8The LORD will accomplish that which concerneth me;
<br>Thy mercy, O LORD, endureth for ever;
<br>Forsake not the work of Thine own
<br> 
<br>138
<br> 
<br>[A Psalm] of David.
<br> 
<br>hands.
<br> 
<br>I will give Thee thanks with my whole heart,
<br>In the presence of the mighty will I
<br> 
<br>139
<br> 
<br>For the Leader. A Psalm of David.
<br> 
<br>sing praises unto Thee.
<br>2I will bow down toward Thy holy temple,
<br> 
<br>O LORD, Thou hast searched me, and known me.
<br> 
<br>2Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising,
<br>Thou understandest my thought afar off.
<br>3Thou measurest my going about and my lying down,
<br>And art acquainted with all my ways.
<br>4For there is not a word in my tongue,
<br>But, lo, O LORD, Thou knowest it altogether.
<br>5Thou hast hemmed me in behind and before,
<br>And laid Thy hand upon me.
<br>6Such knowledge is too wonderful for me;
<br>Too high, I cannot attain unto it.
<br>
<br>7Whither shall I go from Thy spirit?
<br>Or whither shall I flee from Thy presence?
<br>8If I ascend up into heaven, Thou art there;
<br>If I make my bed in the nether- world, behold, Thou art there.
<br>9If I take the wings of the morning,
<br>And dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;
<br>10Even there would Thy hand lead me,
<br>And Thy right hand would hold me.
<br>11And if I say: ‘Surely the darkness shall envelop me,
<br>And the light about me shall be night';
<br>12Even the darkness is not too dark for Thee,
<br>But the night shineth as the day;
<br> 
<br>The darkness is even as the light.
<br>
<br>13For Thou hast made my reins;
<br>Thou hast knit me together in my mother's womb.
<br>14I will give thanks unto Thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made;
<br>Wonderful are Thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.
<br>15My frame was not hidden from Thee,
<br>When I was made in secret,
<br>And curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.
<br>16Thine eyes did see mine unformed substance,
<br>And in Thy book they were all written—
<br>Even the days that were fashioned,
<br>When as yet there was none of them.
<br>17How weighty also are Thy thoughts unto me, O God!
<br>How great is the sum of them!
<br>18If I would count them, they are more in number than the sand;
<br>Were I to come to the end of them, I would still be with Thee.
<br>
<br>19If Thou but wouldest slay the wicked, O God—
<br>Depart from me therefore, ye men of blood;
<br>20Who utter Thy name with wicked thought,
<br>They take it for falsehood, even Thine enemies—
<br> 
<br>21Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate Thee?
<br>And do not I strive with those that rise up against Thee?
<br>22I hate them with utmost hatred; I count them mine enemies.
<br>23Search me, O God, and know my heart,
<br>Try me, and know my thoughts;
<br>24And see if there be any way in me that is grievous,
<br>And lead me in the way everlasting.
<br> 
<br>7I have said unto the LORD: 'Thou art my God';
<br>Give ear, O LORD, unto the voice of my supplications.
<br>8O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation,
<br>Who hast screened my head in the day of battle,
<br>9Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked;
<br>Further not his evil device, so that they exalt themselves.	Selah
<br> 
<br>140
<br> 
<br>
<br>For the Leader. A Psalm of David.
<br> 
<br>
<br>10As for the head of those that compass me about,
<br>Let the mischief of their own lips
<br> 
<br>2Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man;
<br>Preserve me from the violent man;
<br>3Who devise evil things in their heart;
<br>Every day do they stir up wars.
<br>4They have sharpened their tongue like a serpent;
<br>Vipers' venom is under their lips.
<br>Selah
<br>
<br>5Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked;
<br>Preserve me from the violent man;
<br>Who have purposed to make my steps slip.
<br>6The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords;
<br> 
<br>cover them.
<br>11Let burning coals fall upon them; Let them be cast into the fire,
<br>Into deep pits, that they rise not up again.
<br>12A slanderer shall not be established in the earth;
<br>The violent and evil man shall be hunted with thrust upon thrust.
