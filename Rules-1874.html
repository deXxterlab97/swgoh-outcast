<br>
<br>(c) Exception Based on Medical Necessity.—Pursuant to such regulations as the Secretary shall prescribe to carry out this section, the Secretary may furnish more than seven days of health care services described in subsection (b), and may furnish transportation necessary to receive such services, to a newborn child based on medical necessity if the child is in need of additional care, including if the child has been discharged or released from a hospital and requires readmittance to ensure the health and welfare of the child.

<br>(3) Amounts paid by the Department for transportation under this section shall be derived from the Medical Services appropriations account of the Department.
<br>
<br>(e) Reimbursement or Payment for Health Care Services or Transportation.—(1) Pursuant to regulations the Secretary shall prescribe to establish rates of reimbursement and any limitations thereto under this section, the Secretary shall directly reimburse a covered entity for health care services or transportation services provided under this section, unless the cost of the services or transportation is covered by an established agreement or contract.
