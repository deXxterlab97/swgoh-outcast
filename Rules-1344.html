<br>§5325. Contract funding and indirect costs
<br>(a) Amount of funds provided
<br>
<br>(1) The amount of funds provided under the terms of self-determination contracts entered into pursuant to this chapter shall not be less than the appropriate Secretary would have otherwise provided for the operation of the programs or portions thereof for the period covered by the contract, without regard to any organizational level within the Department of the Interior or the Department of Health and Human Services, as appropriate, at which the program, function, service, or activity or portion thereof, including supportive administrative functions that are otherwise contractable, is operated.
<br>
<br>(2) There shall be added to the amount required by paragraph (1) contract support costs which shall consist of an amount for the reasonable costs for activities which must be carried on by a tribal organization as a contractor to ensure compliance with the terms of the contract and prudent management, but which—
<br>
<br>(A) normally are not carried on by the respective Secretary in his direct operation of the program; or
<br>
<br>(B) are provided by the Secretary in support of the contracted program from resources other than those under contract.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) The contract support costs that are eligible costs for the purposes of receiving funding under this chapter shall include the costs of reimbursing each tribal contractor for reasonable and allowable costs of—
<br>
<br>(i) direct program expenses for the operation of the Federal program that is the subject of the contract; and
<br>
<br>(ii) any additional administrative or other expense incurred by the governing body of the Indian Tribe or Tribal organization and any overhead expense incurred by the tribal contractor in connection with the operation of the Federal program, function, service, or activity pursuant to the contract,
<br>
<br>except that such funding shall not duplicate any funding provided under subsection (a)(1) of this section.
<br>
<br>(B) In calculating the reimbursement rate for expenses described in subparagraph (A)(ii), not less than 50 percent of the expenses described in subparagraph (A)(ii) that are incurred by the governing body of an Indian Tribe or Tribal organization relating to a Federal program, function, service, or activity carried out pursuant to the contract shall be considered to be reasonable and allowable.
<br>
<br>(C) On an annual basis, during such period as a tribe or tribal organization operates a Federal program, function, service, or activity pursuant to a contract entered into under this chapter, the tribe or tribal organization shall have the option to negotiate with the Secretary the amount of funds that the tribe or tribal organization is entitled to receive under such contract pursuant to this paragraph.
<br>
<br>(4) For each fiscal year during which a self-determination contract is in effect, any savings attributable to the operation of a Federal program, function, service, or activity under a self-determination contract by a tribe or tribal organization (including a cost reimbursement construction contract) shall—
<br>
<br>(A) be used to provide additional services or benefits under the contract; or
<br>
<br>(B) be expended by the tribe or tribal organization in the succeeding fiscal year, as provided in section 13a of this title.
<br>
<br>(5) Subject to paragraph (6), during the initial year that a self-determination contract is in effect, the amount required to be paid under paragraph (2) shall include startup costs consisting of the reasonable costs that have been incurred or will be incurred on a one-time basis pursuant to the contract necessary—
<br>
<br>(A) to plan, prepare for, and assume operation of the program, function, service, or activity that is the subject of the contract; and
<br>
<br>(B) to ensure compliance with the terms of the contract and prudent management.
<br>
<br>(6) Costs incurred before the initial year that a self-determination contract is in effect may not be included in the amount required to be paid under paragraph (2) if the Secretary does not receive a written notification of the nature and extent of the costs prior to the date on which such costs are incurred.
<br>(b) Reductions and increases in amount of funds provided
<br>
<br>The amount of funds required by subsection (a) of this section—
<br>
<br>(1) shall not be reduced to make funding available for contract monitoring or administration by the Secretary;
<br>
<br>(2) shall not be reduced by the Secretary in subsequent years except pursuant to—
<br>
<br>(A) a reduction in appropriations from the previous fiscal year for the program or function to be contracted;
<br>
<br>(B) a directive in the statement of the managers accompanying a conference report on an appropriation bill or continuing resolution;
<br>
<br>(C) a tribal authorization;
<br>
<br>(D) a change in the amount of pass-through funds needed under a contract; or
<br>
<br>(E) completion of a contracted project, activity, or program;
<br>
<br>(3) shall not be reduced by the Secretary to pay for Federal functions, including, but not limited to, Federal pay costs, Federal employee retirement benefits, automated data processing, contract technical assistance or contract monitoring;
<br>
<br>(4) shall not be reduced by the Secretary to pay for the costs of Federal personnel displaced by a self-determination contract; and
<br>
<br>(5) may, at the request of the tribal organization, be increased by the Secretary if necessary to carry out this chapter or as provided in section 5324(c) of this title.
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision in this chapter, the provision of funds under this chapter is subject to the availability of appropriations and the Secretary is not required to reduce funding for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe to make funds available to another tribe or tribal organization under this chapter.
<br>(c) Annual reports
<br>
<br>Not later than May 15 of each year, the Secretary shall prepare and submit to Congress an annual report on the implementation of this chapter. Such report shall include—
<br>
<br>(1) an accounting of the total amounts of funds provided for each program and the budget activity for direct program costs and contract support costs of tribal organizations under self-determination;
<br>
<br>(2) an accounting of any deficiency in funds needed to provide required contract support costs to all contractors for the fiscal year for which the report is being submitted;
<br>
<br>(3) the indirect cost rate and type of rate for each tribal organization that has been negotiated with the appropriate Secretary;

<br>
<br>(5) the indirect cost pool amounts and the types of costs included in the indirect cost pool; and
<br>

<br>(d) Treatment of shortfalls in indirect cost recoveries
<br>
<br>(1) Where a tribal organization's allowable indirect cost recoveries are below the level of indirect costs that the tribal organizations should have received for any given year pursuant to its approved indirect cost rate, and such shortfall is the result of lack of full indirect cost funding by any Federal, State, or other agency, such shortfall in recoveries shall not form the basis for any theoretical over-recovery or other adverse adjustment to any future years' indirect cost rate or amount for such tribal organization, nor shall any agency seek to collect such shortfall from the tribal organization.
<br>
<br>(2) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to authorize the Secretary to fund less than the full amount of need for indirect costs associated with a self-determination contract.
<br>(e) Liability for indebtedness incurred before fiscal year 1992
<br>
<br>Indian tribes and tribal organizations shall not be held liable for amounts of indebtedness attributable to theoretical or actual under-recoveries or theoretical over-recoveries of indirect costs, as defined in Office of Management and Budget Circular A–87, incurred for fiscal years prior to fiscal year 1992.
<br>(f) Limitation on remedies relating to cost disallowances
<br>
<br>Any right of action or other remedy (other than those relating to a criminal offense) relating to any disallowance of costs shall be barred unless the Secretary has given notice of any such disallowance within three hundred and sixty-five days of receiving any required annual single agency audit report or, for any period covered by law or regulation in force prior to October 19, 1984, any other required final audit report. Such notice shall set forth the right of appeal and hearing to the board of contract appeals pursuant to section 5331 of this title. For the purpose of determining the 365-day period specified in this paragraph, an audit report shall be deemed to have been received on the date of actual receipt by the Secretary, if, within 60 days after receiving the report, the Secretary does not give notice of a determination by the Secretary to reject the single-agency report as insufficient due to noncompliance with chapter 75 of title 31 or noncompliance with any other applicable law. Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to enlarge the rights of the Secretary with respect to section 5123 of this title.
<br>(g) Addition to contract of full amount contractor entitled; adjustment
<br>
<br>Upon the approval of a self-determination contract, the Secretary shall add to the contract the full amount of funds to which the contractor is entitled under subsection (a) of this section, subject to adjustments for each subsequent year that such tribe or tribal organization administers a Federal program, function, service, or activity under such contract.
<br>(h) Indirect costs for contracts for construction programs
<br>
<br>In calculating the indirect costs associated with a self-determination contract for a construction program, the Secretary shall take into consideration only those costs associated with the administration of the contract and shall not take into consideration those moneys actually passed on by the tribal organization to construction contractors and subcontractors.
<br>(i) Indian Health Service and Bureau of Indian Affairs budget consultations
<br>
<br>On an annual basis, the Secretary shall consult with, and solicit the participation of, Indian tribes and tribal organizations in the development of the budget for the Indian Health Service and the Bureau of Indian Affairs (including participation of Indian tribes and tribal organizations in formulating annual budget requests that the Secretary submits to the President for submission to Congress pursuant to section 1105 of title 31).
<br>(j) Use of funds for matching or cost participation requirements
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a tribal organization may use funds provided under a self-determination contract to meet matching or cost participation requirements under other Federal and non-Federal programs.
<br>(k) Allowable uses of funds without approval of Secretary
<br>
<br>Without intending any limitation, a tribal organization may, without the approval of the Secretary, expend funds provided under a self-determination contract for the following purposes, to the extent that the expenditure of the funds is supportive of a contracted program:
<br>
<br>(1) Depreciation and use allowances not otherwise specifically prohibited by law, including the depreciation of facilities owned by the tribe or tribal organization.
<br>
<br>(2) Publication and printing costs.
<br>
<br>(3) Building, realty, and facilities costs, including rental costs or mortgage expenses.
<br>
<br>(4) Automated data processing and similar equipment or services.

<br>§5330. Rescission of contract or grant and assumption of control of program, etc.; authority; grounds; procedure; correction of violation as prerequisite to new contract or grant agreement; construction with occupational safety and health requirements
<br>
<br>Each contract or grant agreement entered into pursuant to sections 5321 and 5322 1 of this title shall provide that in any case where the appropriate Secretary determines that the tribal organization's performance under such contract or grant agreement involves (1) the violation of the rights or endangerment of the health, safety, or welfare of any persons; or (2) gross negligence or mismanagement in the handling or use of funds provided to the tribal organization pursuant to such contract or grant agreement, or in the management of trust fund, trust lands or interests in such lands pursuant to such contract or grant agreement, such Secretary may, under regulations prescribed by him and after providing notice and a hearing on the record to such tribal organization, rescind such contract or grant agreement, in whole or in part, and assume or resume control or operation of the program, activity, or service involved if he determines that the tribal organization has not taken corrective action as prescribed by the Secretary to remedy the contract deficiency, except that the appropriate Secretary may, upon written notice to a tribal organization, and the tribe served by the tribal organization, immediately rescind a contract or grant, in whole or in part, and resume control or operation of a program, activity, function, or service, if the Secretary finds that (i) there is an immediate threat of imminent harm to the safety of any person, or imminent substantial and irreparable harm to trust funds, trust lands, or interests in such lands, and (ii) such threat arises from the failure of the contractor to fulfill the requirements of the contract. In such cases, the Secretary shall provide the tribal organization with a hearing on the record within ten days or such later date as the tribal organization may approve.
