<br>§371. Conspiracy to commit offense or to defraud United States
<br>
<br>If two or more persons conspire either to commit any offense against the United States, or to defraud the United States, or any agency thereof in any manner or for any purpose, and one or more of such persons do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy, each shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.
<br>
<br>If, however, the offense, the commission of which is the object of the conspiracy, is a misdemeanor only, the punishment for such conspiracy shall not exceed the maximum punishment provided for such misdemeanor.

<br>(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 701; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, §330016(1)(L), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147.)
<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§88, 294 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §37, 35 Stat. 1096; Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §178a, as added Sept. 27, 1944, ch. 425, 58 Stat. 752).
<br>
<br>This section consolidates said sections 88 and 294 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed.
<br>
<br>To reflect the construction placed upon said section 88 by the courts the words "or any agency thereof" were inserted. (See Haas v. Henkel, 1909, 30 S. Ct. 249, 216 U. S. 462, 54 L. Ed. 569, 17 Ann. Cas. 1112, where court said: "The statute is broad enough in its terms to include any conspiracy for the purpose of impairing, obstructing, or defeating the lawful functions of any department of government." Also, see United States v. Walter, 1923, 44 S. Ct. 10, 263 U. S. 15, 68 L. Ed. 137, and definitions of department and agency in section 6 of this title.)
<br>
<br>The punishment provision is completely rewritten to increase the penalty from 2 years to 5 years except where the object of the conspiracy is a misdemeanor. If the object is a misdemeanor, the maximum imprisonment for a conspiracy to commit that offense, under the revised section, cannot exceed 1 year.
<br>
<br>The injustice of permitting a felony punishment on conviction for conspiracy to commit a misdemeanor is described by the late Hon. Grover M. Moscowitz, United States district judge for the eastern district of New York, in an address delivered March 14, 1944, before the section on Federal Practice of the New York Bar Association, reported in 3 Federal Rules Decisions, pages 380–392.
<br>
<br>Hon. John Paul, United States district judge for the western district of Virginia, in a letter addressed to Congressman Eugene J. Keogh dated January 27, 1944, stresses the inadequacy of the 2-year sentence prescribed by existing law in cases where the object of the conspiracy is the commission of a very serious offense.
<br>
<br>The punishment provision of said section 294 of title 18 was considered for inclusion in this revised section. It provided the same penalties for conspiracy to violate the provisions of certain counterfeiting laws, as are applicable in the case of conviction for the specific violations. Such a punishment would seem as desirable for all conspiracies as for such offenses as counterfeiting and transporting stolen property in interstate commerce.
<br>
<br>A multiplicity of unnecessary enactments inevitably leads to confusion and disregard of law. (See reviser's note under section 493 of this title.)
<br>
<br>Since consolidation was highly desirable and because of the strong objections of prosecutors to the general application of the punishment provision of said section 294, the revised section represents the best compromise that could be devised between sharply conflicting views.
<br>
<br>A number of special conspiracy provisions, relating to specific offenses, which were contained in various sections incorporated in this title, were omitted because adequately covered by this section. A few exceptions were made, (1) where the conspiracy would constitute the only offense, or (2) where the punishment provided in this section would not be commensurate with the gravity of the offense. Special conspiracy provisions were retained in sections 241, 286, 372, 757, 794, 956, 1201, 2271, 2384 and 2388 of this title. Special conspiracy provisions were added to sections 2153 and 2154 of this title.

<br>
<br>1994—Pub. L. 103–322 substituted "fined under this title" for "fined not more than $10,000".
<br>§372. Conspiracy to impede or injure officer
<br>
<br>If two or more persons in any State, Territory, Possession, or District conspire to prevent, by force, intimidation, or threat, any person from accepting or holding any office, trust, or place of confidence under the United States, or from discharging any duties thereof, or to induce by like means any officer of the United States to leave the place, where his duties as an officer are required to be performed, or to injure him in his person or property on account of his lawful discharge of the duties of his office, or while engaged in the lawful discharge thereof, or to injure his property so as to molest, interrupt, hinder, or impede him in the discharge of his official duties, each of such persons shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than six years, or both.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §54 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §21, 35 Stat. 1092).
<br>
<br>Scope of section was enlarged to cover all possessions of the United States. When the section was first enacted in 1861 there were no possessions, and hence the use of the words "State or Territory" was sufficient to describe the area then subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. The word "District" was inserted by the codifiers of the 1909 Criminal Code.

<br>Amendments
<br>
<br>2002—Pub. L. 107–273 substituted "under this title" for "not more than $5,000".
<br>§373. Solicitation to commit a crime of violence
<br>
<br>(a) Whoever, with intent that another person engage in conduct constituting a felony that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against property or against the person of another in violation of the laws of the United States, and under circumstances strongly corroborative of that intent, solicits, commands, induces, or otherwise endeavors to persuade such other person to engage in such conduct, shall be imprisoned not more than one-half the maximum term of imprisonment or (notwithstanding section 3571) fined not more than one-half of the maximum fine prescribed for the punishment of the crime solicited, or both; or if the crime solicited is punishable by life imprisonment or death, shall be imprisoned for not more than twenty years.
<br>
<br>(b) It is an affirmative defense to a prosecution under this section that, under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and complete renunciation of his criminal intent, the defendant prevented the commission of the crime solicited. A renunciation is not "voluntary and complete" if it is motivated in whole or in part by a decision to postpone the commission of the crime until another time or to substitute another victim or another but similar objective. If the defendant raises the affirmative defense at trial, the defendant has the burden of proving the defense by a preponderance of the evidence.
<br>
<br>(c) It is not a defense to a prosecution under this section that the person solicited could not be convicted of the crime because he lacked the state of mind required for its commission, because he was incompetent or irresponsible, or because he is immune from prosecution or is not subject to prosecution.
<br>
<br>(Added Pub. L. 98–473, title II, §1003(a), Oct. 12, 1984, 98 Stat. 2138; amended Pub. L. 99–646, §26, Nov. 10, 1986, 100 Stat. 3597; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, §330016(2)(A), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2148.)

<br>
<br>(1) Misbehavior of any person in its presence or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice;
<br>

<br>
<br>Said section 385 conferred two powers. The first part authorizing courts of the United States to impose and administer oaths will remain in title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Judicial Code and Judiciary. The second part relating to contempt of court constitutes this section.

<br>
<br>2002—Pub. L. 107–273 inserted "or both," after "fine or imprisonment," in introductory provisions.
<br>§402. Contempts constituting crimes
<br>
<br>Any person, corporation or association willfully disobeying any lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command of any district court of the United States or any court of the District of Columbia, by doing any act or thing therein, or thereby forbidden, if the act or thing so done be of such character as to constitute also a criminal offense under any statute of the United States or under the laws of any State in which the act was committed, shall be prosecuted for such contempt as provided in section 3691 of this title and shall be punished by a fine under this title or imprisonment, or both.
<br>
<br>Such fine shall be paid to the United States or to the complainant or other party injured by the act constituting the contempt, or may, where more than one is so damaged, be divided or apportioned among them as the court may direct, but in no case shall the fine to be paid to the United States exceed, in case the accused is a natural person, the sum of $1,000, nor shall such imprisonment exceed the term of six months.
<br>
<br>This section shall not be construed to relate to contempts committed in the presence of the court, or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice, nor to contempts committed in disobedience of any lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command entered in any suit or action brought or prosecuted in the name of, or on behalf of, the United States, but the same, and all other cases of contempt not specifically embraced in this section may be punished in conformity to the prevailing usages at law.
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, the term "State" includes a State of the United States, the District of Columbia, and any commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>1948 Act
<br>
<br>Based on sections 386, 387, 389, and 390a of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Judicial Code and Judiciary (Oct. 15, 1914, ch. 323, §§1, 21, 22, 24, 38 Stat. 730, 738, 739).
<br>
<br>Section 21 of the Clayton Act, section 386 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Judicial Code and Judiciary, is here consolidated with parts of sections 1, 22, and 24 of the same act. Section 1 of said act, section 390a of title 28 U.S.C., 1940 ed., Judicial Code and Judiciary, defined person or persons. Section 22 of said act, section 387 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Judicial Code and Judiciary, regulated the procedure and provided for the punishment of contempts. Section 24 of said act, section 389 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Judicial Code and Judiciary, limited the application of these sections to certain kinds of contempt.
<br>
<br>In transferring these sections to this title and in consolidating them numerous changes of phraseology were necessary which do not, however, change their meaning or substance. Words "corporation or association" were inserted after "any person" in substitution for the definition provisions of section 390a of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Judicial Code and Judiciary, which read as follows: "The word 'person' or 'persons' wherever used in sections 381–383, 386–390a of this title, sections 12, 13, 14–19, 20, 21, 22–27 and 44 of title 15, and section 412 of title 18 shall be deemed to include corporations and associations existing under or authorized by the laws of either the United States, the laws of any of the Territories, the laws of any State, or the laws of any foreign country."
<br>
<br>The words "any person, corporation, or association," unqualified except by the context of the section mean all that the more lengthy definition included. Only those persons, corporations, and associations who were parties to the order or had actual notice of it may be punished for contempt. (See McCauly v. First Trust & Savings Bank, C.C.A. Ill. 1921, 276 F. 117. See, also National Labor Relations Board v. Blackstone Mfg. Co., C.C.A. 1941, 123 F. 2d 633.) The fact that the contemnor was incorporated or organized under a foreign law or under the laws of a particular State or Territory would hardly be relevant to the issue of criminal contempt.
<br>
<br>As noted above these sections were part of the Clayton Act, entitled "An act to supplement existing laws against unlawful restraints and monopolies, and for other purposes." Whatever doubt might have existed as to whether the contempt provisions were variously limited to antitrust cases seems to be dispelled by the case of Sandefur v. Canoe Creek Coal Co. (C.C.A. Ky. 1923, 293 F. 379, certified question answered 45 S. Ct. 18, 266 U.S. 42, 69 L. Ed. 162, 35 A.L.R. 451), where the court says: "The act, considered as a whole, covers several more or less distinct subjects. * * * The first eight sections pertain directly to the subject of trust and monopolies; section 9 concerns interstate commerce; section 10, combinations among common carriers; section 11, proceedings to enforce certain provisions of the act; sections 12–16, antitrust procedure and remedies; sections 17–19, regulations of injunction and restraining orders in all cases; section 20 limits the power of an equity court to issue any injunction in a certain class of cases, viz., between employer and the employee; and sections 21–24 pertain to procedure in any district court, punishing contemptuous disregard of any order of such court, providing the act constituting contempt is also a criminal offense. Observing this relation of the various parts of the act to each other, we think 'within the purview of this act' must refer to that portion of the act which most broadly covers the subject-matter to which section 22 is devoted, and this portion is section 21, which reaches all cases where the act of contempt is also a criminal offense. We know of nothing in the legislative history of the act, or within the common knowledge as to the then existing situation, which justifies us in thinking that 'within the purview of this act,' in section 22, meant to limit its effect to the employer-employee provisions of section 20, or even to the antitrust scope of some of the earlier sections." (See also Michaelson v. United States, 1924, 45 S. Ct. 18, 166 U.S. 42, 69 L. Ed. 162, 35 A.L.R. 451, and H. Rept. No. 613, 62d Cong., 2d sess., to accompany H.R. 15657.)

<br>§433. Exemptions with respect to certain contracts
<br>
<br>Sections 431 and 432 of this title shall not extend to any contract or agreement made or entered into, or accepted by any incorporated company for the general benefit of such corporation; nor to the purchase or sale of bills of exchange or other property where the same are ready for delivery and payment therefor is made at the time of making or entering into the contract or agreement. Nor shall the provisions of such sections apply to advances, loans, discounts, purchase or repurchase agreements, extensions, or renewals thereof, or acceptances, releases or substitutions of security therefor or other contracts or agreements made or entered into under the Reconstruction Finance Corporation Act, the Agricultural Adjustment Act, the Federal Farm Loan Act, the Emergency Farm Mortgage Act of 1933, the Farm Credit Act of 1933, or the Home Owners Loan Act of 1933, the Farmers' Home Administration Act of 1946, the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act, or to crop insurance agreements or contracts or agreements of a kind which the Secretary of Agriculture may enter into with farmers.
<br>
<br>Any exemption permitted by this section shall be made a matter of public record.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on section 1514(f) of title 7, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Agriculture; sections 264w, 598, 1138d(e), 1441(e), 1467(d) of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking; section 616(e) of title 15, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Commerce and Trade; title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §206 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §116, 35 Stat. 1109; Dec. 23, 1913, ch. 6, §22(j), as added June 19, 1934, ch. 653, §3, 48 Stat. 1107; Jan. 22, 1932, ch. 8, §16(e), 47 Stat. 12; July 22, 1932, ch. 522, §21, 47 Stat. 738; June 13, 1933, ch. 64, §8, 48 Stat. 135; June 16, 1933, ch. 98, §64, 48 Stat. 268, 269; Jan. 25, 1934, ch. 5, 48 Stat. 337; Jan. 31, 1934, ch. 7, §13, 48 Stat. 347; June 27, 1934, ch. 847, title V, §510, 58 Stat. 1264; May 28, 1935, ch. 150, §§20, 21, 49 Stat. 298; Aug. 23, 1935, ch. 614, §101, 49 Stat. 703; Aug. 26, 1937, ch. 821, 50 Stat. 838; Feb. 16, 1938, ch. 30, title V, §514, 52 Stat. 77).
<br>
<br>These sections were consolidated with such changes of phraseology as were necessary to effect consolidation. Said section 206 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., was the principal source of this section, but the enumeration of the kinds of commitments exempted was drawn from the various sections of said title 12 set forth above. The reference to crop insurance agreements is drawn from section 1514(f) of Title 7, Agriculture.
<br>
<br>The applicability provisions of the sections here consolidated were unclear and of doubtful value. As revised the section preserves everything of value without change of substance.
<br>
<br>References to the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act and the Farmers' Home Administrative Act of 1946 were included in this revised section notwithstanding the omission (and consequent repeal) of former subsection (d) of section 52 of the said Bankhead-Jones Act (1937) (Title 7, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §1026) in the amendment of said section 52 of such Act by section 3 of the said Farmers' Home Administration Act of 1946 (August 14, 1946, ch. 964, 60 Stat. 1062). The essential nature of the transactions under the several acts would render inconsistent any attempt to include some and exclude others.

<br>§442. Government Publishing Office
<br>
<br>(a) Definitions.—In this section—
<br>
<br>(1) the terms "diversified", "employee benefit plan", "holdings", "mutual fund", and "unit investment trust" have the meanings given those terms under section 2640.102 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor thereto; and
<br>
<br>(2) the term "printing-related interest" means an interest, direct or indirect, in—
<br>
<br>(A) the publication of any newspaper or periodical;
<br>
<br>(B) any printing, binding, engraving, or lithographing of any kind; or
<br>
<br>(C) any contract for furnishing paper or other material connected with the public printing, binding, lithographing, or engraving.
<br>
<br>(b) Offense.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—Except as provided in paragraph (2), the Director of the Government Publishing Office, Deputy Director of the Government Publishing Office, nor 1 any of their assistants as determined by the Director of the Government Publishing Office shall not,1 during his or her continuance in office, have any printing-related interest.
<br>
<br>(2) Exception for mutual funds, unit investment trusts, employee benefit plans, and retirement plans.—It shall not be a violation of paragraph (1) for an individual who is described in such paragraph to have an interest in a diversified mutual fund, diversified unit investment trust, employee benefit plan, investment fund under the Thrift Savings Plan under subchapter III of chapter 84 of title 5, or pension plan established or maintained by a State government or any political subdivision of a State government for its employees that has 1 or more holdings that are printing-related interests if the fund, trust, or plan does not exhibit a practice of concentrating in printing-related interests.
<br>
<br>(3) Authority of supervising ethics office.—The supervising ethics office for the Government Publishing Office under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App.) shall have the authority to issue rules and promulgate regulations governing the implementation of this subsection.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on section 53 of title 44, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Public Printing and Documents (Jan. 12, 1895, ch. 23, §34, 28 Stat. 605).
<br>
<br>Words "on conviction before any court of competent jurisdiction" were omitted as unnecessary, since punishment cannot be imposed until there has been a conviction before a competent tribunal.
<br>
<br>Words "in the penitentiary" were omitted as surplusage as section 4082 of this title commits all prisoners to the custody of the Attorney General. (See reviser's note under section 1 of this title.)
<br>
<br>The minimum punishment provision "for a term of not less than one nor" was omitted in keeping with policy of codifiers of 1909 Criminal Code.
<br>
<br>Mandatory punishment provision was rephrased in the alternative.
<br>
<br>The offense described in this section involves no moral turpitude, and therefore the punishment provisions were reduced from 5 years to 1 year, so that the stigma of a felony would not attach to an offender. The fine was increased from $500 to $1,000 as more proportionate to the 1-year term of imprisonment. (See classification of felony and misdemeanor in section 1 of this title and note thereunder.)

<br>§443. War contracts
<br>
<br>Whoever willfully secretes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys—
<br>
<br>(a) any records of a war contractor relating to the negotiation, award, performance, payment, interim financing, cancellation or other termination, or settlement of a war contract of $25,000 or more; or
<br>
<br>(b) any records of a war contractor or purchaser relating to any disposition of termination inventory in which the consideration received by any war contractor or any government agency is $5,000 or more,
<br>
<br>before the lapse of (1) five years after such disposition of termination inventory by such war contractor or government agency, or (2) five years after the final settlement of such war contract, whichever applicable period is longer, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.
<br>
<br>The Administrator of General Services, by regulation, may authorize the destruction of such records upon such terms and conditions as he deems appropriate, including the requirement for the making and retaining of photographs or microphotographs, which shall have the same force and effect as the originals thereof.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Based on section 119, first and second paragraphs, of title 41 U.S.C., 1940 ed., Public Contracts (July 1, 1944, ch. 358, §19(a), 58 Stat. 667).
<br>
<br>Section was rewritten with changes of phraseology to conform to the style adopted in the revision.
<br>
<br>The definition of "records" was omitted as surplusage in order to avoid any inference that "records" as used in other sections was intended to have a different or more limited connotation than the broad and commonly understood meaning popularly assigned to the term.
<br>
<br>The last paragraph was added to obviate any possibility of doubt as to meaning of terms defined in section 103 of Title 41, Public Contracts.
<br>
<br>Reference to persons causing or procuring was omitted as unnecessary in view of definition of "principal" in section 2 of this title.

<br>
<br>1951—Act Oct. 31, 1951, substituted "12 o'clock noon of December 31, 1946" for "the termination of hostilities in the present war as proclaimed by the President or by a concurrent resolution of the two Houses of Congress", and, in penultimate paragraph, substituted "Administrator of General Services" for "Director of Contract Settlement".
