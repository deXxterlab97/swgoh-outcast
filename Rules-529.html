<br>
<br>Subject to subsection (j), each national securities exchange shall pay to the Commission a fee at a rate equal to $15 1 per $1,000,000 of the aggregate dollar amount of sales of securities (other than bonds, debentures, other evidences of indebtedness, security futures products, and options on securities indexes (excluding a narrow-based security index)) transacted on such national securities exchange.
<br>(c) Off-exchange trades of exchange registered and last-sale-reported securities

<br>(d) Assessments on security futures transactions
<br>
<br>Each national securities exchange and national securities association shall pay to the Commission an assessment equal to $0.009 for each round turn transaction (treated as including one purchase and one sale of a contract of sale for future delivery) on a security future traded on such national securities exchange or by or through any member of such association otherwise than on a national securities exchange, except that for fiscal year 2007 and each succeeding fiscal year such assessment shall be equal to $0.0042 for each such transaction.
<br>(e) Dates for payments
<br>
<br>The fees and assessments required by subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section shall be paid—
<br>
<br>(1) on or before March 15, with respect to transactions and sales occurring during the period beginning on the preceding September 1 and ending at the close of the preceding December 31; and
<br>
<br>(2) on or before September 25, with respect to transactions and sales occurring during the period beginning on the preceding January 1 and ending at the close of the preceding August 31.
<br>(f) Exemptions
<br>
<br>The Commission, by rule, may exempt any sale of securities or any class of sales of securities from any fee or assessment imposed by this section, if the Commission finds that such exemption is consistent with the public interest, the equal regulation of markets and brokers and dealers, and the development of a national market system.
<br>(g) Publication
<br>
<br>The Commission shall publish in the Federal Register notices of the fee and assessment rates applicable under this section for each fiscal year not later than 30 days after the date on which an Act making a regular appropriation to the Commission for such fiscal year is enacted, together with any estimates or projections on which such fees are based.
<br>(h) Pro rata application
<br>
<br>The rates per $1,000,000 required by this section shall be applied pro rata to amounts and balances of less than $1,000,000.
<br>(i) Deposit of fees
<br>(1) Offsetting collections
<br>
<br>Fees collected pursuant to subsections (b), (c), and (d) for any fiscal year—
<br>
<br>(A) shall be deposited and credited as offsetting collections to the account providing appropriations to the Commission; and
<br>
<br>(B) except as provided in subsection (k), shall not be collected for any fiscal year except to the extent provided in advance in appropriation Acts.
<br>(2) General revenues prohibited
<br>
<br>No fees collected pursuant to subsections (b), (c), and (d) for fiscal year 2002 or any succeeding fiscal year shall be deposited and credited as general revenue of the Treasury.
<br>(j) Adjustments to fee rates
<br>(1) Annual adjustment
<br>
<br>Subject to subsections (i)(1)(B) and (k), for each fiscal year, the Commission shall by order adjust each of the rates applicable under subsections (b) and (c) for such fiscal year to a uniform adjusted rate that, when applied to the baseline estimate of the aggregate dollar amount of sales for such fiscal year, is reasonably likely to produce aggregate fee collections under this section (including assessments collected under subsection (d) of this section) that are equal to the regular appropriation to the Commission by Congress for such fiscal year.
<br>(2) Mid-year adjustment
<br>
<br>Subject to subsections (i)(1)(B) and (k), for each fiscal year, the Commission shall determine, by March 1 of such fiscal year, whether, based on the actual aggregate dollar volume of sales during the first 5 months of such fiscal year, the baseline estimate of the aggregate dollar volume of sales used under paragraph (1) for such fiscal year is reasonably likely to be 10 percent (or more) greater or less than the actual aggregate dollar volume of sales for such fiscal year. If the Commission so determines, the Commission shall by order, no later than March 1, adjust each of the rates applicable under subsections (b) and (c) for such fiscal year to a uniform adjusted rate that, when applied to the revised estimate of the aggregate dollar amount of sales for the remainder of such fiscal year, is reasonably likely to produce aggregate fee collections under this section (including fees collected during such five-month period and assessments collected under subsection (d) of this section) that are equal to the regular appropriation to the Commission by Congress for such fiscal year. In making such revised estimate, the Commission shall, after consultation with the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget, use the same methodology required by subsection (l).
<br>(3) Review
<br>
<br>In exercising its authority under this subsection, the Commission shall not be required to comply with the provisions of section 553 of title 5. An adjusted rate prescribed under paragraph (1) or (2) and published under subsection (g) shall not be subject to judicial review.
<br>(4) Effective date
<br>(A) Annual adjustment
<br>
<br>Subject to subsections (i)(1)(B) and (k), an adjusted rate prescribed under paragraph (1) shall take effect on the later of—
<br>
<br>(i) the first day of the fiscal year to which such rate applies; or
<br>
<br>(ii) 60 days after the date on which an Act making a regular appropriation to the Commission for such fiscal year is enacted.
<br>(B) Mid-year adjustment
<br>
<br>An adjusted rate prescribed under paragraph (2) shall take effect on April 1 of the fiscal year to which such rate applies.
<br>(k) Lapse of appropriation
<br>
<br>If on the first day of a fiscal year a regular appropriation to the Commission has not been enacted, the Commission shall continue to collect (as offsetting collections) the fees and assessments under subsections (b), (c), and (d) at the rate in effect during the preceding fiscal year, until 60 days after the date such a regular appropriation is enacted.
<br>(l) Baseline estimate of the aggregate dollar amount of sales
<br>
<br>The baseline estimate of the aggregate dollar amount of sales for any fiscal year is the baseline estimate of the aggregate dollar amount of sales of securities (other than bonds, debentures, other evidences of indebtedness, security futures products, and options on securities indexes (excluding a narrow-based security index)) to be transacted on each national securities exchange and by or through any member of each national securities association (otherwise than on a national securities exchange) during such fiscal year as determined by the Commission, after consultation with the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget, using the methodology required for making projections pursuant to section 907 of title 2.
<br>(m) Transmittal of Commission budget requests
<br>(1) Budget required
<br>
<br>For fiscal year 2012, and each fiscal year thereafter, the Commission shall prepare and submit a budget to the President. Whenever the Commission submits a budget estimate or request to the President or the Office of Management and Budget, the Commission shall concurrently transmit copies of the estimate or request to the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate, the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate, and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives.
<br>(2) Submission to Congress
<br>
<br>The President shall submit each budget submitted under paragraph (1) to Congress, in unaltered form, together with the annual budget for the Administration submitted by the President.
<br>(3) Contents
<br>
<br>The Commission shall include in each budget submitted under paragraph (1)—
<br>
<br>(A) an itemization of the amount of funds necessary to carry out the functions of the Commission.
<br>
<br>(B) an amount to be designated as contingency funding to be used by the Commission to address unanticipated needs; and

<br>The Board of Directors shall consist of seven persons as follows:
<br>
<br>(A) One director shall be appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury from among the officers and employees of the Department of the Treasury.

<br>
<br>(ii) two such directors shall be selected from the general public from among persons who are not associated with a broker or dealer or associated with a member of a national securities exchange, within the meaning of section 78c(a)(18) or section 78c(a)(21), respectively, of this title, or similarly associated with any self-regulatory organization or other securities industry group, and who have not had any such association during the two years preceding appointment.

<br>
<br>The President shall designate a Chairman and Vice Chairman from among those directors appointed under paragraph (2)(C)(ii) of this subsection.
<br>(4) Terms

<br>
<br>(B) the Commission finds that such proposed bylaw change involves a matter of such significant public interest that public comment should be obtained, in which case it may, after notifying SIPC in writing of such finding, require that the procedures set forth in paragraph (2) be followed with respect to such proposed bylaw change, in the same manner as if such proposed bylaw change were a proposed rule change within the meaning of such paragraph.
