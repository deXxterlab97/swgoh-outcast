<br>22He draweth away the mighty also by his power;
<br>He riseth up, and he trusteth not his own life.
<br>23Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth,
<br>Yet His eyes are upon their ways.
<br>24They are exalted for a little while, and they are gone;
<br>Yea, they are brought low, they are gathered in as all others,
<br> 
<br>And wither as the tops of the ears of corn.
<br>25And if it be not so now, who will prove me a liar,
<br>And make my speech nothing worth?
<br>
<br>Then	answered	Bildad the Shuhite, and said:
<br>2Dominion and fear are with Him; He maketh peace in His high places. 3Is there any number of His armies?
<br>And upon whom doth not His light arise?
<br>4How then can man be just with God?
<br>Or how can he be clean that is born of a woman?
<br>5Behold, even the moon hath no brightness,
<br>And the stars are not pure in His sight;
<br>6How much less man, that is a worm!
<br>And the son of man, that is a maggot!
<br>
<br>Then Job answered and said:
<br>2How hast thou helped him that is without power!
<br>How hast thou saved the arm that hath no strength!
<br>3How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom,
<br>And plentifully declared sound knowledge!
<br>4With whose help hast thou uttered words?
<br> 
<br>And whose spirit came forth from thee?
<br>
<br>5The shades tremble Beneath the waters and the
<br>inhabitants thereof.
<br>6The nether-world is naked before Him,
<br>And Destruction hath no covering.
<br>7He stretcheth out the north over the empty space,
<br>And hangeth the earth over nothing.
<br>8He bindeth up the waters in His thick clouds;
<br>And the cloud is not rent under them.
<br>9He closeth in the face of His throne,
<br>And spreadeth His cloud upon it.
<br>10He hath described a boundary upon the face of the waters,
<br>Unto the confines of light and darkness.
<br>11The pillars of heaven tremble And are astonished at His rebuke. 12He stirreth up the sea with His
<br>power,
<br>And by His understanding He smiteth through Rahab.
<br>13By His breath the heavens are serene;
<br>His hand hath pierced the slant serpent.
<br>14Lo, these are but the outskirts of His ways;
<br>And how small a whisper is heard of Him!
<br>But the thunder of His mighty deeds who can understand?
<br> 
<br>
<br>And Job again took up his parable, and said:
<br>2As God liveth, who hath taken away my right;
<br>And the Almighty, who hath dealt bitterly with me;
<br>3All the while my breath is in me And the spirit of God is in my
<br>nostrils,
<br>4Surely my lips shall not speak unrighteousness,
<br>Neither shall my tongue utter deceit;
<br>5Far be it from me that I should justify you;
<br>Till I die I will not put away mine integrity from me.
<br>6My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go;
<br>My heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.
<br>
<br>7Let mine enemy be as the wicked,
<br>And let him that riseth up against me be as the unrighteous.
<br>8For what is the hope of the godless, though he get him gain,
<br>When God taketh away his soul?
<br>9Will God hear his cry,
<br>When trouble cometh upon him?
<br>10Will he have his delight in the Almighty,
<br>And call upon God at all times?
<br>11I will teach you concerning the hand of God;
<br>That which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.
<br>12Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it;
<br> 
<br>Why then are ye become altogether vain?
<br>13This is the portion of a wicked man with God,
<br>And the heritage of oppressors, which they receive from the Almighty.
<br>14If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword;
<br>And his offspring shall not have bread enough.
<br>15Those that remain of him shall be buried by pestilence,
<br>And his widows shall make no lamentation.
<br>16Though he heap up silver as the dust,
<br>And prepare raiment as the clay;
<br>17He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on,
<br>And the innocent shall divide the silver.
<br>18He buildeth his house as a moth,
<br>And as a booth which the keeper maketh.
<br>19He lieth down rich, but there shall be nought to gather;
<br>He openeth his eyes, and his wealth is not.
<br>20Terrors overtake him like waters;
<br>A tempest stealeth him away in the night.
<br>21The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth;
<br>And it sweepeth him out of his place.
<br>22Yea, it hurleth at him, and spareth not;
<br>He would fain flee from its power.
<br> 
<br>23Men shall clap their hands at him, And shall hiss him out of his place.
<br>
<br>For there is a mine for silver,
<br>And a place for gold which they refine.
<br>2Iron is taken out of the dust,
<br>And brass is molten out of the stone.
<br>3Man setteth an end to darkness,
<br>And searcheth out to the furthest bound
<br>The stones of thick darkness and of the shadow of death.
<br>4He breaketh open a shaft away from where men sojourn;
<br>They are forgotten of the foot that passeth by;
<br>They hang afar from men, they swing to and fro.
<br>5As for the earth, out of it cometh bread,
<br>And underneath it is turned up as it were by fire.
<br>6The stones thereof are the place of sapphires,
<br>And it hath dust of gold.
<br>7That path no bird of prey knoweth, Neither hath the falcon’s eye seen it; 8The proud beasts have not trodden
<br>it,
<br>Nor hath the lion passed thereby.
<br>9He putteth forth his hand upon the flinty rock;
<br>He overturneth the mountains by the roots.
<br>10He cutteth out channels among the rocks;
<br>And his eye seeth every precious thing.
<br> 
<br>11He bindeth the streams that they trickle not;
<br>And the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light.
<br>
<br>12But wisdom, where shall it be found?
<br>And where is the place of understanding?
<br>13Man knoweth not the price thereof;
<br>Neither is it found in the land of the living.
<br>14The deep saith: ‘It is not in me’;
<br>And the sea saith: ‘It is not with me.’
<br>15It cannot be gotten for gold,
<br>Neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof.
<br>16It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir,
<br>With the precious onyx, or the sapphire.
<br>17Gold and glass cannot equal it;
<br>Neither shall the exchange thereof be vessels of fine gold.
<br>18No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal;
<br>Yea, the price of wisdom is above rubies.
<br>19The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it,
<br>Neither shall it be valued with pure gold.
<br>
<br>20Whence then cometh wisdom?
<br>And where is the place of understanding?
<br> 
<br>21Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living,
<br>And kept close from the fowls of the air.
<br>22Destruction and Death say: ‘We have heard a rumor thereof
<br>with our ears.’
<br>23God understandeth the way thereof,
<br>And He knoweth the place thereof.
<br>24For He looketh to the ends of the earth,
<br>And seeth under the whole heaven;
<br>25When He maketh a weight for the wind,
<br>And meteth out the waters by measure.
<br>26When He made a decree for the rain,
<br>And a way for the storm of thunders;
<br>27Then did He see it, and declare it;
<br>He established it, yea, and searched it out.
<br>
<br>28And unto man He said:
<br>‘Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom;
<br>And to depart from evil is understanding.’
<br>
<br>And Job again took up his parable, and said:
<br>2Oh that I were as in the months of old,
<br>As in the days when God watched over me;
<br>3When His lamp shined above my head,
<br> 
<br>And by His light I walked through darkness;
<br>4As I was in the days of my youth,
<br>When the converse of God was upon my tent;
<br>5When the Almighty was yet with me,
<br>And my children were about me;
<br>6When my steps were washed with butter,
<br>And the rock poured me out rivers of oil!
<br>7When I went forth to the gate unto the city,
<br>When I prepared my seat in the broad place,
<br>8The young men saw me and hid themselves,
<br>And the aged rose up and stood;
<br>9The princes refrained talking,
<br>And laid their hand on their mouth;
<br>10The voice of the nobles was hushed,
<br>And their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.
<br>11For when the ear heard me, then it blessed me,
<br>And when the eye saw me, it gave witness unto me;
<br>12Because I delivered the poor that cried,
<br>The fatherless also, that had none to help him.
<br>13The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me; and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy.
<br>14I put on righteousness, and it clothed itself with me;
<br> 
<br>My justice was as a robe and a diadem.
<br>15I was eyes to the blind, And feet was I to the lame. 16I was a father to the needy;
<br>And the cause of him that I knew not I searched out.
<br>17And I broke the jaws of the unrighteous,
<br>And plucked the prey out of his teeth.
<br>18Then I said: ‘I shall die with my nest,
<br>And I shall multiply my days as the phoenix;
<br>19My root shall be spread out to the waters,
<br>And the dew shall lie all night upon my branch;
<br>20My glory shall be fresh in me,
<br>And my bow shall be renewed in my hand.’
<br>
<br>21Unto me men gave ear, and waited,
<br>And kept silence for my counsel.
<br>22After my words they spoke not again;
<br>And my speech dropped upon them.
<br>23And they waited for me as for the rain;
<br>And they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain.
<br>24If I laughed on them, they believed it not;
<br>And the light of my countenance they cast not down.
<br>25I chose out their way, and sat as chief,
<br> 
<br>And dwelt as a king in the army,
<br>As one that comforteth the mourners.
<br>
<br>But now they that are younger than I have me in derision,
<br>Whose fathers I disdained to set with the dogs of my flock.
<br>2Yea, the strength of their hands, whereto should it profit me?
<br>Men in whom ripe age is perished.
<br>3They are gaunt with want and famine;
<br>They gnaw the dry ground, in the gloom of wasteness and desolation.
<br>4They pluck salt-wort with wormwood;
<br>And the roots of the broom are their food.
<br>5They are driven forth from the midst of men;
<br>They cry after them as after a thief.
<br>6In the clefts of the valleys must they dwell,
<br>In holes of the earth and of the rocks.
<br>7Among the bushes they bray;
<br>Under the nettles they are gathered together.
<br>8They are children of churls, yea, children of ignoble men;
<br>They were scourged out of the land.
<br>
<br>9And now I am become their song, Yea, I am a byword unto them.
<br>10They abhor me, they flee far from me,
<br>And spare not to spit in my face.
<br> 
<br>11For He hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me,
<br>And they have cast off the bridle before me.
<br>12Upon my right hand rise the brood;
<br>They entangle my feet,
<br>And they cast up against me their ways of destruction.
<br>13They break up my path, They further my calamity, Even men that have no helper.
<br>14As through a wide breach they come;
<br>In the midst of the ruin they roll themselves upon me.
<br>15Terrors are turned upon me,
<br>They chase mine honour as the wind;
<br>And my welfare is passed away as a cloud.
<br>
<br>16And now my soul is poured out within me;
<br>Days of affliction have taken hold upon me.
<br>17In the night my bones are pierced, and fall from me,
<br>And my sinews take no rest.
<br>18By the great force [of my disease] is my garment disfigured;
<br>It bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.
<br>19He hath cast me into the mire,
<br>And I am become like dust and ashes.
<br>20I cry unto Thee, and Thou dost not answer me;
<br>I stand up, and Thou lookest at me.
<br> 
<br>21Thou art turned to be cruel to me;
<br>With the might of Thy hand Thou hatest me.
<br>22Thou liftest me up to the wind, Thou causest me to ride upon it;
<br>And Thou dissolvest my substance.
<br>23For I know that Thou wilt bring me to death,
<br>And to the house appointed for all living.
<br>
<br>24Surely none shall put forth his hand to a ruinous heap,
<br>Neither because of these things shall help come in one’s calamity,
<br>25If I have not wept for him that was in trouble,
<br>And if my soul grieved not for the needy.
<br>26Yet, when I looked for good, there came evil;
<br>And when I waited for light, there came darkness.
<br>27Mine inwards boil, and rest not;
<br>Days of affliction are come upon me.
<br>28I go mourning without the sun;
<br>I stand up in the assembly, and cry for help.
<br>29I am become a brother to jackals, And a companion to ostriches.
<br>30My skin is black, and falleth from me,
<br>And my bones are burned with heat.
<br>31Therefore is my harp turned to mourning,
<br>And my pipe into the voice of them that weep.
<br> 
<br>I made a covenant with mine eyes;
<br>How then should I look upon a maid?
<br>2For what would be the portion of God from above,
<br>And the heritage of the Almighty from on high?
<br>3Is it not calamity to the unrighteous,
<br>And disaster to the workers of iniquity?
<br>4Doth not He see my ways, And count all my steps?
<br>
<br>5If I have walked with vanity,
<br>And my foot hath hasted to deceit—
<br>6Let me be weighed in a just balance,
<br>That God may know mine integrity—
<br>7If my step hath turned out of the way,
<br>And my heart walked after mine eyes,
<br>And if any spot hath cleaved to my hands;
<br>8Then let me sow, and let another eat;
<br>Yea, let the produce of my field be rooted out.
<br>
<br>9If my heart have been enticed unto a woman,
<br>And I have lain in wait at my neighbour’s door;
<br>10Then let my wife grind unto another,
<br>And let others bow down upon her.
<br> 
<br>11For that were a heinous crime;
<br>Yea, it were an iniquity to be punished by the judges.
<br>12For it is a fire that consumeth unto destruction,
<br>And would root out all mine increase.
<br>
<br>13If I did despise the cause of my man-servant,
<br>Or of my maid-servant, when they contended with me—
<br>14What then shall I do when God riseth up?
<br>And when He remembereth, what shall I answer Him?
<br>15Did not He that made me in the womb make him?
<br>And did not One fashion us in the womb?
<br>
<br>16If I have withheld aught that the poor desired,
<br>Or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;
<br>17Or have eaten my morsel myself alone,
<br>And the fatherless hath not eaten thereof—
<br>18Nay, from my youth he grew up with me as with a father,
<br>And I have been her guide from my mother’s womb.
<br>19If I have seen any wanderer in want of clothing,
<br>Or that the needy had no covering;
<br>20If his loins have not blessed me,
<br>And if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep;
<br> 
<br>21If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless,
<br>Because I saw my help in the gate;
<br>22Then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder-blade,
<br>And mine arm be broken from the bone.
<br>23For calamity from God was a terror to me,
<br>And by reason of His majesty I could do nothing.
<br>24If I have made gold my hope, And have said to the fine gold: ‘Thou art my confidence’;
<br>25If I rejoiced because my wealth was great,
<br>And because my hand had gotten much;
<br>26If I beheld the sun when it shined, Or the moon walking in brightness; 27And my heart hath been secretly
<br>enticed,
<br>And my mouth hath kissed my hand;
<br>28This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judges;
<br>For I should have lied to God that is above.
<br>
<br>29If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me,
<br>Or exulted when evil found him—
<br>30Yea, I suffered not my mouth to sin
<br>By asking his life with a curse. 31If the men of my tent said not: ‘Who can find one that hath not
<br>been satisfied with his meat?’
<br> 
<br>32The stranger did not lodge in the street;
<br>My doors I opened to the roadside.
<br>
<br>33If after the manner of men I covered my transgressions,
<br>By hiding mine iniquity in my bosom—
<br>34Because I feared the great multitude,
<br>And the most contemptible among families terrified me,
<br>So that I kept silence, and went not out of the door.
<br>
<br>35Oh that I had one to hear me!— Lo, here is my signature, let the
<br>Almighty answer me—
<br>And that I had the indictment which mine adversary hath written!
<br>36Surely I would carry it upon my shoulder;
<br>I would bind it unto me as a crown.
<br>37I would declare unto him the number of my steps;
<br>As a prince would I go near unto him.
<br>
<br>38If my land cry out against me,
<br>And the furrows thereof weep together;
<br>39If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money,
<br>Or have caused the tillers thereof to be disappointed—
<br>40Let thistles grow instead of wheat,
<br>And noisome weeds instead of barley.
<br> 
<br>The words of Job are ended.
<br>
<br>So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes. 2Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram; against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God. 3Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job. 4Now Elihu had waited to speak unto Job, because they were older than he. 5And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, his
<br>wrath was kindled.
<br>6And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said:
<br>I am young, and ye are very old;
<br>Wherefore I held back, and durst not declare you mine opinion.
<br>7I said: ‘Days should speak,
<br>And multitude of years should teach wisdom.’
<br>8But it is a spirit in man,
<br>And the breath of the Almighty, that giveth them understanding.
<br>9It is not the great that are wise, Nor the aged that discern judgment. 10Therefore I say: ‘Hearken to me; I also will declare mine opinion.’
<br>
<br>11Behold, I waited for your words, I listened for your reasons,
<br>Whilst ye searched out what to say.
<br>12Yea, I attended unto you,
<br> 
<br>And, behold, there was none that convinced Job,
<br>Or that answered his words, among you.
<br>13Beware lest ye say: ‘We have found wisdom;
<br>God may vanquish him, not man! ’
<br>14For he hath not directed his words against me;
<br>Neither will I answer him with your speeches.
<br>
<br>15They are amazed, they answer no more;
<br>Words are departed from them.
<br>16And shall I wait, because they speak not,
<br>Because they stand still, and answer no more?
<br>17I also will answer my part,
<br>I also will declare mine opinion.
<br>18For I am full of words;
<br>The spirit within me constraineth me.
<br>19Behold, mine inwards are as wine which hath no vent;
<br>Like new wine-skins which are ready to burst.
<br>20I will speak, that I may find relief; I will open my lips and answer.
<br>21Let me not, I pray you, respect any man’s person;
<br>Neither will I give flattering titles unto any man.
<br>22For I know not to give flattering titles;
<br>Else would my Maker soon take me away
<br> 
<br>Howbeit, Job, I pray thee, hear my speech,
<br>And hearken to all my words.
<br>2Behold now, I have opened my mouth,
<br>My tongue hath spoken in my mouth.
<br>3My words shall utter the uprightness of my heart;
<br>And that which my lips know they shall speak sincerely.
<br>4The spirit of God hath made me,
<br>And the breath of the Almighty given me life.
<br>5If thou canst, answer thou me, Set thy words in order before me,
<br>stand forth.
<br>6Behold, I am toward God even as thou art;
<br>I also am formed out of the clay.
<br>7Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid,
<br>Neither shall my pressure be heavy upon thee.
<br>
<br>8Surely thou hast spoken in my hearing,
<br>And I have heard the voice of thy words;
<br>9’I am clean, without transgression,
<br>I am innocent, neither is there iniquity in me;
<br>10Behold, He findeth occasions against me,
<br>He counteth me for His enemy; 11He putteth my feet in the stocks, He marketh all my paths.’
<br> 
<br>12Behold, I answer thee: In this thou art not right,
<br>That God is too great for man;
<br>13Why hast thou striven against Him?
<br>Seeing that He will not answer any of his words.
<br>14For God speaketh in one way,
<br>Yea in two, though man perceiveth it not.
<br>15In a dream, in a vision of the night, When deep sleep falleth upon men, In slumberings upon the bed;
<br>16Then He openeth the ears of men,
<br>And by their chastisement sealeth the decree,
<br>17That men may put away their purpose,
<br>And that He may hide pride from man;
<br>18That He may keep back his soul from the pit,
<br>And his life from perishing by the sword.
<br>19He is chastened also with pain upon his bed,
<br>And all his bones grow stiff;
<br>20So that his life maketh him to abhor bread,
<br>And his soul dainty food.
<br>21His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen;
<br>And his bones corrode to unsightliness.
<br>22Yea, his soul draweth near unto the pit,
<br>And his life to the destroyers.
<br>23If there be for him an angel,
<br> 
<br>An intercessor, one among a thousand,
<br>To vouch for a man’s uprightness;
<br>24Then He is gracious unto him, and saith:
<br>‘Deliver him from going down to the pit,
<br>I have found a ransom.’
<br>25His flesh is tenderer than a child’s;
<br>He returneth to the days of his youth;
<br>26He prayeth unto God, and He is favourable unto him;
<br>So that he seeth His face with joy;
<br>And He restoreth unto man his righteousness.
<br>27He cometh before men, and saith: ‘I have sinned, and perverted that
<br>which was right, And it profited me not.’
<br>28So He redeemeth his soul from going into the pit,
<br>And his life beholdeth the light.
<br>
<br>29Lo, all these things doth God work,
<br>Twice, yea thrice, with a man,
<br>30To bring back his soul from the pit,
<br>That he may be enlightened with the light of the living.
<br>
<br>31Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me;
<br>Hold thy peace, and I will speak.
<br>32If thou hast any thing to say, answer me;
<br>Speak, for I desire to justify thee.
<br>33If not, hearken thou unto me;
<br> 
<br>Hold thy peace, and I will teach thee wisdom.
<br>
<br>Moreover Elihu answered and said:
<br>2Hear my words, ye wise men;
<br>And give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.
<br>3For the ear trieth words, As the palate tasteth food.
<br>4Let us choose for us that which is right;
<br>Let us know among ourselves what is good.
<br>5For Job hath said: ‘I am righteous, And God hath taken away my right; 6Notwithstanding my right I am
<br>accounted a liar;
<br>My wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.’
<br>7What man is like Job,
<br>Who drinketh up scorning like water?
<br>8Who goeth in company with the workers of iniquity,
<br>And walketh with wicked men.
<br>9For he hath said: ‘It profiteth a man nothing
<br>That he should be in accord with God.’
<br>
<br>10Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding:
<br>Far be it from God, that He should do wickedness;
<br>And from the Almighty, that He should commit iniquity.
<br>11For the work of a man will He requite unto him,
<br> 
<br>And cause every man to find according to his ways.
<br>12Yea, of a surety, God will not do wickedly,
<br>Neither will the Almighty pervert justice.
<br>13Who gave Him a charge over the earth?
<br>Or who hath disposed the whole world?
<br>14If He set His heart upon man,
<br>If He gather unto Himself his spirit and his breath;
<br>15All flesh shall perish together, And man shall return unto dust.
<br>
<br>16If now thou hast understanding, hear this;
<br>Hearken to the voice of my words.
<br>17Shall even one that hateth right govern?
<br>And wilt thou condemn Him that is just and mighty—
<br>18Is it fit to say to a king: ‘Thou art base’?
<br>Or to nobles: ‘Ye are wicked’?—
<br>19That respecteth not the persons of princes,
<br>Nor regardeth the rich more than the poor?
<br>For they all are the work of His hands.
<br>20In a moment they die, even at midnight;
<br>The people are shaken and pass away,
<br>And the mighty are taken away without hand.
<br> 
<br>21For His eyes are upon the ways of a man,
<br>And He seeth all his goings.
<br>22There is no darkness, nor shadow of death,
<br>Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
<br>23For He doth not appoint a time unto any man,
<br>When he should go before God in judgment.
<br>24He breaketh in pieces mighty men without inquisition,
<br>And setteth others in their stead.
<br>25Therefore He taketh knowledge of their works;
<br>And He overturneth them in the night, so that they are crushed.
<br>26He striketh them as wicked men In the open sight of others; 27Because they turned aside from
<br>following Him,
<br>And would not have regard to any of His ways;
<br>28So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto Him,
<br>And He heareth the cry of the afflicted.
<br>29When He giveth quietness, who then can condemn?
<br>And when He hideth His face, who then can behold Him?
<br>Whether it be done unto a nation, or unto a man, alike;
<br>30That the godless man reign not,
<br>That there be none to ensnare the people.
<br>
<br>31For hath any said unto God:
<br> 
<br>‘I have borne chastisement, though I offend not;
<br>32That which I see not teach Thou me;
<br>If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more’?
<br>33Shall His recompense be as thou wilt? For thou loathest it,
<br>So that thou must choose, and not I; Therefore speak what thou knowest. 34Men of understanding will say
<br>unto me,
<br>Yea, every wise man that heareth me:
<br>35’Job speaketh without knowledge,
<br>And his words are without discernment.’
<br>36Would that Job were tried unto the end,
<br>Because of his answering like wicked men.
<br>37For he addeth rebellion unto his sin,
<br>He clappeth his hands among us, And multiplieth his words against
<br>God.
<br>
<br>Moreover Elihu answered and said:
<br>2Thinkest thou this to be thy right,
<br>Or sayest thou: ‘I am righteousness before God’,
<br>3That thou inquirest: ‘What advantage will it be unto Thee?’
<br>And: ‘What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned?’
<br>4I will give thee answer,
<br>And thy companions with thee.
<br>5Look unto the heavens, and see;
<br> 
<br>And behold the skies, which are higher than thou.
<br>6If thou hast sinned, what doest thou against Him?
<br>And if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto Him?
<br>7If thou be righteous, what givest thou Him?
<br>Or what receiveth He of thy hand?
<br>8Thy wickedness concerneth a man as thou art;
<br>And thy righteousness a son of man.
<br>
<br>9By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out;
<br>They cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty.
<br>10But none saith: ‘Where is God my Maker,
<br>Who giveth songs in the night;
<br>11Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth,
<br>And maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?’
<br>12There they cry, but none giveth answer,
<br>Because of the pride of evil men. 13Surely God will not hear vanity, Neither will the Almighty regard it. 14Yea, when thou sayest thou canst
<br>not see Him—
<br>The cause is before Him; therefore wait thou for Him.
<br>15And now, is it for nought that He punished in His anger?
<br>And hath He not full knowledge of arrogance?
<br> 
<br>16But Job doth open his mouth in vanity;
<br>He multiplieth words without knowledge.
<br>
<br>Elihu	also	proceeded,	and said:
<br>2Suffer me a little, and I will tell thee;
<br>For there are yet words on God’s behalf.
<br>3I will fetch my knowledge from afar,
<br>And will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
<br>4For truly my words are not false;
<br>One that is upright in mind is with thee.
<br>5Behold, God is mighty, yet He despiseth not any;
<br>He is mighty in strength of understanding.
<br>6He preserveth not the life of the wicked;
<br>But giveth to the poor their right.
<br>7He withdraweth not His eyes from the righteous;
<br>But with kings upon the throne He setteth them for ever, and they
<br>are exalted.
<br>8And if they be bound in fetters, And be holden in cords of affliction; 9Then He declareth unto them their
<br>work,
<br>And their transgressions, that they have behaved themselves proudly.
<br>10He openeth also their ear to discipline,
<br> 
<br>And commandeth that they return from iniquity.
<br>11If they hearken and serve Him,
<br>They shall spend their days in prosperity,
<br>And their years in pleasures.
<br>12But if they hearken not, they shall perish by the sword,
<br>And they shall die without knowledge.
<br>13But they that are godless in heart lay up anger;
<br>They cry not for help when He bindeth them.
<br>14Their soul perisheth in youth,
<br>And their life as that of the depraved.
<br>15He delivereth the afflicted by His affliction,
<br>And openeth their ear by tribulation.
<br>16Yea, He hath allured thee out of distress
<br>Into a broad place, where there is no straitness;
<br>And that which is set on thy table is full of fatness;
<br>17And thou art full of the judgment of the wicked;
<br>Judgment and justice take hold on them.
<br>18For beware of wrath, lest thou be led away by thy sufficiency;
<br>Neither let the greatness of the ransom turn thee aside.
<br>19Will thy riches avail, that are without stint,
<br>Or all the forces of thy strength?
<br>20Desire not the night,
<br> 
<br>When peoples are cut off in their place.
<br>21Take heed, regard not iniquity;
<br>For this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.
<br>
<br>22Behold, God doeth loftily in His power;
<br>Who is a teacher like Him?
<br>23Who hath enjoined Him His way?
<br>Or who hath said: ‘Thou hast wrought unrighteousness’?
<br>24Remember that thou magnify His work,
<br>Whereof men have sung.
<br>25All men have looked thereon; Man beholdeth it afar off.
<br>26Behold, God is great, beyond our knowledge;
<br>The number of His years is unsearchable.
<br>27For He draweth away the drops of water,
<br>Which distil rain from His vapour;
<br>28Which the skies pour down And drop upon the multitudes of
<br>men.
<br>29Yea, can any understand the spreadings of the clouds,
<br>The crashings of His pavilion?
<br>30Behold, He spreadeth His light upon it;
<br>And He covereth the depths of the sea.
<br>31For by these He judgeth the peoples;
<br>He giveth food in abundance.
<br>32He covereth His hands with the lightning,
<br> 
<br>And giveth it a charge that it strike the mark.
<br>33The noise thereof telleth concerning it,
<br>The cattle also concerning the storm that cometh up.
<br>
<br>At this also my heart trembleth,
<br>And is moved out of its place.
<br>2Hear attentively the noise of His voice,
<br>And the sound that goeth out of His mouth.
<br>3He sendeth it forth under the whole heaven,
<br>And His lightning unto the ends of the earth.
<br>4After it a voice roareth;
<br>He thundereth with the voice of His majesty;
<br>And He stayeth them not when His voice is heard.
<br>5God thundereth marvellously with His voice;
<br>Great things doeth He, which we cannot comprehend.
<br>6For He saith to the snow: ‘Fall thou on the earth’;
<br>Likewise to the shower of rain, and to the showers of His mighty rain.
<br>7He sealeth up the hand of every man,
<br>That all men whom He hath made may know it.
<br>8Then the beasts go into coverts, And remain in their dens.
<br>9Out of the Chamber cometh the storm;
<br> 
<br>And cold out of the north.
<br>10By the breath of God ice is given,
<br>And the breadth of the waters is straitened.
<br>11Yea, He ladeth the thick cloud with moister,
<br>He spreadeth abroad the cloud of His lightning;
<br>12And they are turned round about by His guidance,
<br>That they may do whatsoever He commandeth them
<br>Upon the face of the habitable world:
<br>13Whether it be for correction, or for His earth,
<br>Or for mercy, that He cause it to come.
<br>
<br>14Hearken unto this, O Job; Stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.
<br>15Dost thou know how God enjoineth them,
<br>And causeth the lightning of His cloud to shine?
<br>16Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds,
<br>The wondrous works of Him who is perfect in knowledge?
<br>17Thou whose garments are warm,
<br>When the earth is still by reason of the south wind;
<br>18Canst thou with Him spread out the sky,
<br>Which is strong as a molten mirror?
<br>19Teach us what we shall say unto Him;
<br> 
<br>For we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness.
<br>20Shall it be told Him that I would speak?
<br>Or should a man wish that he were swallowed up?
<br>
<br>21And now men see not the light which is bright in the skies;
<br>But the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.
<br>22Out of the north cometh golden splendour,
<br>About God is terrible majesty.
<br>23The Almighty, whom we cannot find out, is excellent in power,
<br>Yet to judgment and plenteous justice He doeth no violence.
<br>24Men do therefore fear Him;
<br>He regardeth not any that are wise of heart.
<br>
<br>Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said:
<br>2Who is this that darkeneth counsel By words without knowledge?
<br>3Gird up now thy loins like a man;
<br>For I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto Me.
<br>
<br>4Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?
<br>Declare, if thou hast the understanding.
<br>5Who determined the measures thereof, if thou knowest?
<br>Or who stretched the line upon it?
<br>6Whereupon were the foundations thereof fastened?
<br> 
<br>Or who laid the corner-stone thereof,
<br>7When the morning stars sang together,
<br>And all the sons of God shouted for joy?
<br>
<br>8Or who shut up the sea with doors,
<br>When it broke forth, and issued out of the womb;
<br>9When I made the cloud the garment thereof,
<br>And thick darkness a swaddlingband for it,
<br>10And prescribed for it My decree, And set bars and doors,
<br>11And said: ‘Thus far shalt thou come, but no further;
<br>And here shall thy proud waves be stayed’?
<br>
<br>12Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days began,
<br>And caused the dayspring to know its place;
<br>13That it might take hold of the ends of the earth,
<br>And the wicked be shaken out of it?
<br>14It is changed as clay under the seal;
<br>And they stand as a garment.
<br>15But from the wicked their light is withholden,
<br>And the high arm is broken.
<br>
<br>16Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea?
<br>Or hast thou walked in the recesses of the deep?
<br> 
<br>17Have the gates of death been revealed unto thee?
<br>Or hast thou seen the gates of the shadow of death?
<br>18Hast thou surveyed unto the breadths of the earth?
<br>Declare, if thou knowest it all.
<br>
<br>19Where is the way to the dwelling of light,
<br>And as for darkness, where is the place thereof;
<br>20That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof,
<br>And that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof?
<br>21Thou knowest it, for thou wast then born,
<br>And the number of thy days is great!
<br>22Hast thou entered the treasuries of the snow,
<br>Or hast thou seen the treasuries of the hail,
<br>23Which I have reserved against the time of trouble,
<br>Against the day of battle and war?
<br>
<br>24By what way is the light parted,
<br>Or the east wind scattered upon the earth?
<br>25Who hath cleft a channel for the waterflood,
<br>Or a way for the lightning of the thunder;
<br>26To cause it to rain on a land where no man is,
<br>On the wilderness, wherein there is no man;
<br> 
<br>27To satisfy the desolate and waste ground,
<br>And to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?
<br>28Hath the rain a father?
<br>Or who hath begotten the drops of dew?
<br>29Out of whose womb came the ice?
<br>And the hoar-frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?
<br>30The waters are congealed like stone,
<br>And the face of the deep is frozen.
<br>
<br>31Canst thou bind the chains of the Pleiades,
<br>Or loose the bands of Orion?
<br>32Canst thou lead forth the Mazzaroth in their season?
<br>Or canst thou guide the Bear with her sons?
<br>33Knowest thou the ordinances of the heavens?
<br>Canst thou establish the dominion thereof in the earth?
<br>34Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds,
<br>That abundance of waters may cover thee?
<br>35Canst thou send forth lightnings, that they may go,
<br>And say unto thee: ‘Here we are’?
<br>
<br>36Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts?
<br>Or who hath given understanding to the mind?
<br>37Who can number the clouds by wisdom?
<br> 
<br>Or who can pour out the bottles of heaven,
<br>38When the dust runneth into a mass, And the clods cleave fast together?
<br>
<br>39Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lioness?
<br>Or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,
<br>40When they couch in their dens,
<br>And abide in the covert to lie in wait?
<br>41Who provideth for the raven his prey,
<br>When his young ones cry unto God, and wander for lack of food?
<br>Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock
<br>bring forth?
<br>Or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?
<br>2Canst thou number the months that they fulfil?
<br>Or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?
<br>3They bow themselves, they bring forth their young,
<br>They cast out their fruit.
<br>4Their young ones wax strong, they grow up in the open field;
<br>They go forth, and return not again.
<br>
<br>5Who hath sent out the wild ass free?
<br>Or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass?
<br>6Whose house I have made the wilderness,
<br>And the salt land his dwelling-place.
<br> 
<br>7He scorneth the tumult of the city,
<br>Neither heareth he the shoutings of the driver.
<br>8The range of the mountains is his pasture,
<br>And he searcheth after every green thing.
<br>
<br>9Will the wild-ox be willing to serve thee?
<br>Or will he abide by thy crib?
<br>10Canst thou bind the wild-ox with his band in the furrow?
<br>Or will he harrow the valleys after thee?
<br>11Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great?
<br>Or wilt thou leave thy labour to him?
<br>12Wilt thou rely on him, that he will bring home thy seed,
<br>And gather the corn of thy threshing-floor?
<br>
<br>13The wing of the ostrich beateth joyously;
<br>But are her pinions and feathers the kindly stork’s?
<br>14For she leaveth her eggs on the earth,
<br>And warmeth them in dust,
<br>15And forgetteth that the foot may crush them,
<br>Or that the wild beast may trample them.
<br>16She is hardened against her young ones, as if they were not hers;
<br>Though her labour be in vain, she is without fear;
<br> 
<br>17Because God hath deprived her of wisdom,
<br>Neither hath He imparted to her understanding.
<br>18When the time cometh, she raiseth her wings on high,
<br>And scorneth the horse and his rider.
<br>
<br>19Hast thou given the horse his strength?
<br>Hast thou clothed his neck with fierceness?
<br>20Hast thou made him to leap as a locust?
<br>The glory of his snorting is terrible.
<br>21He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength;
<br>He goeth out to meet the clash of arms.
<br>22He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted;
<br>Neither turneth he back from the sword.
<br>23The quiver rattleth upon him,
<br>The glittering spear and the javelin.
<br>24He swalloweth the ground with storm and rage;
<br>Neither believeth he that it is the voice of the horn.
<br>25As oft as he heareth the horn he saith: ‘Ha, ha! ’
<br>And he smelleth the battle afar off,
<br>The thunder of the captains, and the shouting.
<br>
<br>26Doth the hawk soar by thy wisdom,
<br> 
<br>And stretch her wings toward the south?
<br>27Doth the vulture mount up at thy command,
<br>And make her nest on high?
<br>28She dwelleth and abideth on the rock,
<br>Upon the crag of the rock, and the stronghold.
<br>29From thence she spieth out the prey;
<br>Her eyes behold it afar off.
<br>30Her young ones also suck up blood;
<br>And where the slain are, there is she.
<br>
<br>Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said:
<br>2Shall he that reproveth contend with the Almighty?
<br>He that argueth with God, let him answer it.
<br>
<br>3Then Job answered the LORD, and said:
<br>4Behold, I am of small account; what shall I answer Thee?
<br>I lay my hand upon my mouth.
<br>5Once have I spoken, but I will not answer again;
<br>Yea, twice, but I will proceed no further.
<br>
<br>6Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said:
<br>7Gird up thy loins now like a man;
<br>I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto Me.
<br> 
<br>8Wilt thou even make void My judgment?
<br>Wilt thou condemn Me, that thou mayest be justified?
<br>9Or hast thou an arm like God?
<br>And canst thou thunder with a voice like Him?
<br>10Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency,
<br>And array thyself with glory and beauty.
<br>11Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath;
<br>And look upon every one that is proud, and abase him.
<br>12Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low;
<br>And tread down the wicked in their place.
<br>13Hide them in the dust together; Bind their faces in the hidden place. 14Then will I also confess unto thee That thine own right hand can save
<br>thee.
<br>
<br>15Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee;
<br>He eateth grass as an ox.
<br>16Lo now, his strength is in his loins,
<br>And his force is in the stays of his body.
<br>17He straineth his tail like a cedar;
<br>The sinews of his thighs are knit together.
<br>18His bones are as pipes of brass; His gristles are like bars of iron. 19He is the beginning of the ways of
<br>God;
<br>He only that made him can make His sword to approach unto him.
<br> 
<br>20Surely the mountains bring him forth food,
<br>And all the beasts of the field play there.
<br>21He lieth under the lotus-trees,
<br>In the covert of the reed, and fens.
<br>22The lotus-trees cover him with their shadow;
<br>The willows of the brook compass him about.
<br>23Behold, if a river overflow, he trembleth not;
<br>He is confident, though the Jordan rush forth to his mouth.
<br>24Shall any take him by his eyes,
<br>Or pierce through his nose with a snare?
<br>
<br>25Canst thou draw out leviathan with a fish-hook?
<br>Or press down his tongue with a cord?
<br>26Canst thou put a ring into his nose?
<br>Or bore his jaw through with a hook?
<br>27Will he make many supplications unto thee?
<br>Or will he speak soft words unto thee?
<br>28Will he make a covenant with thee,
<br>That thou shouldest take him for a servant for ever?
<br>29Wilt thou play with him as with a bird?
<br>Or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?
<br> 
<br>30Will the bands of fishermen make a banquet of him?
<br>Will they part him among the merchants?
<br>31Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons?
<br>Or his head with fish-spears?
<br>32Lay thy hand upon him;
<br>Think upon the battle, thou wilt do so no more.
<br>
<br>Behold, the hope of him is in vain;
<br>Shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him?
<br>2None is so fierce that dare stir him up;
<br>Who then is able to stand before Me?
<br>3Who hath given Me anything beforehand, that I should repay him?
<br>Whatsoever is under the whole heaven is Mine.
<br>4Would I keep silence concerning his boastings,
<br>Or his proud talk, or his fair array of words?
<br>
<br>5Who can uncover the face of his garment?
<br>Who shall come within his double bridle?
<br>6Who can open the doors of his face?
<br>Round about his teeth is terror.
<br>7His scales are his pride,
<br>Shut up together as with a close seal.
<br> 
<br>8One is so near to another,
<br>That no air can come between them.
<br>9They are joined one to another;
<br>They stick together, that they cannot be sundered.
<br>10His sneezings flash forth light,
<br>And his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.
<br>11Out of his mouth go burning torches,
<br>And sparks of fire leap forth.
<br>12Out of his nostrils goeth smoke,
<br>As out of a seething pot and burning rushes.
<br>13His breath kindleth coals,
<br>And a flame goeth out of his mouth.
<br>14In his neck abideth strength, And dismay danceth before him. 15The flakes of his flesh are joined
<br>together;
<br>They are firm upon him; they cannot be moved.
<br>16His heart is as firm as a stone; Yea, firm as the nether millstone. 17When he raiseth himself up, the
<br>mighty are afraid;
<br>By reason of despair they are beside themselves.
<br>18If one lay at him with the sword, it will not hold;
<br>Nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft.
<br>19He esteemeth iron as straw, And brass as rotten wood.
<br>20The arrow cannot make him flee;
<br>Slingstones are turned with him into stubble.
<br>21Clubs are accounted as stubble;
<br> 
<br>He laugheth at the rattling of the javelin.
<br>22Sharpest potsherds are under him;
<br>He spreadeth a threshing-sledge upon the mire.
<br>23He maketh the deep to boil like a pot;
<br>He maketh the sea like a seething mixture.
<br>24He maketh a path to shine after him;
