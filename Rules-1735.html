<br>
<br>The definitions in clauses (1) and (2), (6)–(10), (14)–(21), and (24) reflect the adoption of terminology which, though undefined in the source statutes restated in this revised title, represent the closest practicable approximation of the ways in which the terms defined have been most commonly used, and so far as possible are identical to those used in title 10, United States Code, containing most of the basic law relating to the armed forces.
<br>
<br>In clause (3), the words "and all Regular and Reserve components thereof", in section 231(a) of existing title 37, are omitted as surplusage. Section 231(j) of existing title 37 is omitted as covered by section 1 of title 1.
<br>
<br>In clause (4), that part of section 32(a) of existing title 37 relating other than to the enumeration of the armed forces is omitted as unnecessary. Section 231(k) of existing title 37 is omitted, since throughout the revised title references to members of the Army or Air Force without specification of component are specifically included when necessary.
<br>
<br>In clause (11), the words "flight officer" are omitted as obsolete. Section 231(c) (last sentence) of existing title 37 is omitted as unnecessary.
<br>

<br>201(g) 	37:232(c) (less last sentence). 	Oct. 12, 1949, ch. 681, §201(c) (less last sentence), 63 Stat. 807; redesignated as "(c)" by Mar. 31, 1955, ch. 20, §2(2), 69 Stat. 19; May 20, 1958, Pub. L. 85–422, §1(3) (first sentence), 72 Stat. 124.
<br>
<br>In subsection (a), the words "whether under temporary or permanent appointment" are omitted as surplusage. The words "the following pay grades" are substituted for the words "the various pay grades prescribed for commissioned officers by subsection (a) of this section, as follows". The words "(other than a commissioned warrant officer)" are inserted to conform to the definition of "warrant officer" in section 101(13) of this revised title.
<br>
<br>In subsection (b), the words "with two or less years of service computed under section 205 of this title" are substituted for the word "minimum".
<br>
<br>In subsections (c) and (e), the words "with two or less years of service computed under section 205 of this title" are substituted for the words "with under two cumulative years' service" and "with under two cumulative years of service", in sections 308 and 232(e), respectively, of existing title 37.
<br>
<br>In subsection (e), the words "enlisted or appointed under the Army Aviation Cadet Act, as amended, or under the Naval Aviation Cadet Act of 1942, as amended" are omitted as obsolete and surplusage.

Further reference is surplusage, however, since aviation cadets are not appointed or enlisted under any provision of law other than the sections of title 10 embodying the former Army Aviation Cadet Act and the Naval Aviation Cadet Act of 1942. The word "basic" is inserted for clarity, since the word "pay" as defined in section 101(21) of this revised title includes special and incentive pays. Incentive pay for aviation cadets is provided in section 301(b) of this revised title.
<br>
<br>In subsection (f), the words "While on active duty", in section 6915(f) of title 10 and section 758a(f) of title 14, are omitted as covered by section 204 of this title which prescribes the conditions under which members of the uniformed services are entitled to basic pay. The words "Unless he is entitled to the basic pay of a higher pay grade" are substituted for the words "or that of his grade, whichever is greater" in section 6915(f) of title 10 and section 758a(f) of title 14.
<br>
<br>In subsection (g), the words "Except as provided by subsections (e) and (f)" are inserted to reflect those subsections relating to enlisted aviation cadets or aviation pilots.
