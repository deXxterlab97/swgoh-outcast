<br>Notwithstanding the preceding paragraphs of this subsection, for Federal Direct PLUS Loans, for which the first disbursement is made on or after July 1, 2013, the applicable rate of interest shall, for loans disbursed during any 12-month period beginning on July 1 and ending on June 30, be determined on the preceding June 1 and be equal to the lesser of—
<br>

<br>(ii) 10.5 percent.
<br>(D) Consolidation loans
<br>

<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of this part 1 with respect to loans for which the first disbursement of principal is made before July 1, 2012,,2 the Secretary is authorized to prescribe by regulation such reductions in the interest rate or origination fee paid by a borrower of a loan made under this part as the Secretary determines appropriate to encourage on-time repayment of the loan. Such reductions may be offered only if the Secretary determines the reductions are cost neutral and in the best financial interest of the Federal Government. Any increase in subsidy costs resulting from such reductions shall be completely offset by corresponding savings in funds available for the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program in that fiscal year from section 1087h of this title and other administrative accounts.
<br>(B) Accountability
<br>
<br>Prior to publishing regulations proposing repayment incentives with respect to loans for which the first disbursement of principal is made before July 1, 2012, the Secretary shall ensure the cost neutrality of such reductions. The Secretary shall not prescribe such regulations in final form unless an official report from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to the Secretary and a comparable report from the Director of the Congressional Budget Office to the Congress each certify that any such reductions will be completely cost neutral. Such reports shall be transmitted to the authorizing committees not less than 60 days prior to the publication of regulations proposing such reductions.
<br>(C) No repayment incentives for new loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2012
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the Secretary is prohibited from authorizing or providing any repayment incentive not otherwise authorized under this part to encourage on-time repayment of a loan under this part for which the first disbursement of principal is made on or after July 1, 2012, including any reduction in the interest or origination fee rate paid by a borrower of such a loan, except that the Secretary may provide for an interest rate reduction for a borrower who agrees to have payments on such a loan automatically electronically debited from a bank account.
<br>(10) Publication
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall determine the applicable rates of interest under this subsection after consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and shall publish such rate in the Federal Register as soon as practicable after the date of determination.

<br>
<br>(C) by substituting "2.0 percent" for "4.0 percent" with respect to loans for which the first disbursement of principal is made on or after July 1, 2008, and before July 1, 2009;
<br>

<br>(1) Design and selection
<br>
<br>Consistent with criteria established by the Secretary, the Secretary shall offer a borrower of a loan made under this part a variety of plans for repayment of such loan, including principal and interest on the loan. The borrower shall be entitled to accelerate, without penalty, repayment on the borrower's loans under this part. The borrower may choose—
<br>
<br>(A) a standard repayment plan, consistent with subsection (a)(1) of this section and with section 1078(b)(9)(A)(i) of this title;
<br>
<br>(B) a graduated repayment plan, consistent with section 1078(b)(9)(A)(ii) of this title;
<br>
<br>(C) an extended repayment plan, consistent with section 1078(b)(9)(A)(iv) of this title, except that the borrower shall annually repay a minimum amount determined by the Secretary in accordance with section 1078(b)(1)(L) of this title;
<br>
<br>(D) an income contingent repayment plan, with varying annual repayment amounts based on the income of the borrower, paid over an extended period of time prescribed by the Secretary, not to exceed 25 years, except that the plan described in this subparagraph shall not be available to the borrower of a Federal Direct PLUS loan made on behalf of a dependent student; and
<br>
<br>(E) beginning on July 1, 2009, an income-based repayment plan that enables borrowers who have a partial financial hardship to make a lower monthly payment in accordance with section 1098e of this title, except that the plan described in this subparagraph shall not be available to the borrower of a Federal Direct PLUS Loan made on behalf of a dependent student or a Federal Direct Consolidation Loan, if the proceeds of such loan were used to discharge the liability on such Federal Direct PLUS Loan or a loan under section 1078–2 of this title made on behalf of a dependent student.
<br>(2) Selection by Secretary
<br>
<br>If a borrower of a loan made under this part does not select a repayment plan described in paragraph (1), the Secretary may provide the borrower with a repayment plan described in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of paragraph (1).
<br>(3) Changes in selections
<br>
<br>The borrower of a loan made under this part may change the borrower's selection of a repayment plan under paragraph (1), or the Secretary's selection of a plan for the borrower under paragraph (2), as the case may be, under such terms and conditions as may be established by the Secretary.
<br>(4) Alternative repayment plans
<br>
<br>The Secretary may provide, on a case by case basis, an alternative repayment plan to a borrower of a loan made under this part who demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the terms and conditions of the repayment plans available under paragraph (1) are not adequate to accommodate the borrower's exceptional circumstances. In designing such alternative repayment plans, the Secretary shall ensure that such plans do not exceed the cost to the Federal Government, as determined on the basis of the present value of future payments by such borrowers, of loans made using the plans available under paragraph (1).
<br>(5) Repayment after default
<br>
<br>The Secretary may require any borrower who has defaulted on a loan made under this part to—
<br>
<br>(A) pay all reasonable collection costs associated with such loan; and
<br>
<br>(B) repay the loan pursuant to an income contingent repayment plan.
<br>(e) Income contingent repayment
<br>(1) Information and procedures
<br>
<br>The Secretary may obtain such information as is reasonably necessary regarding the income of a borrower (and the borrower's spouse, if applicable) of a loan made under this part that is, or may be, repaid pursuant to income contingent repayment, for the purpose of determining the annual repayment obligation of the borrower. Returns and return information (as defined in section 6103 of title 26) may be obtained under the preceding sentence only to the extent authorized by section 6103(l)(13) of title 26. The Secretary shall establish procedures for determining the borrower's repayment obligation on that loan for such year, and such other procedures as are necessary to implement effectively income contingent repayment.
<br>(2) Repayment based on adjusted gross income
<br>
<br>A repayment schedule for a loan made under this part and repaid pursuant to income contingent repayment shall be based on the adjusted gross income (as defined in section 62 of title 26) of the borrower or, if the borrower is married and files a Federal income tax return jointly with the borrower's spouse, on the adjusted gross income of the borrower and the borrower's spouse.
<br>(3) Additional documents
<br>
<br>A borrower who chooses, or is required, to repay a loan made under this part pursuant to income contingent repayment, and for whom adjusted gross income is unavailable or does not reasonably reflect the borrower's current income, shall provide to the Secretary other documentation of income satisfactory to the Secretary, which documentation the Secretary may use to determine an appropriate repayment schedule.
<br>(4) Repayment schedules
<br>
<br>Income contingent repayment schedules shall be established by regulations promulgated by the Secretary and shall require payments that vary in relation to the appropriate portion of the annual income of the borrower (and the borrower's spouse, if applicable) as determined by the Secretary.
<br>(5) Calculation of balance due
<br>
<br>The balance due on a loan made under this part that is repaid pursuant to income contingent repayment shall equal the unpaid principal amount of the loan, any accrued interest, and any fees, such as late charges, assessed on such loan. The Secretary may promulgate regulations limiting the amount of interest that may be capitalized on such loan, and the timing of any such capitalization.
<br>(6) Notification to borrowers
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall establish procedures under which a borrower of a loan made under this part who chooses or is required to repay such loan pursuant to income contingent repayment is notified of the terms and conditions of such plan, including notification of such borrower, that if a borrower considers that special circumstances, such as a loss of employment by the borrower or the borrower's spouse, warrant an adjustment in the borrower's loan repayment, the borrower may contact the Secretary, who shall determine whether such adjustment is appropriate, in accordance with criteria established by the Secretary.
<br>(7) Maximum repayment period
<br>
<br>In calculating the extended period of time for which an income contingent repayment plan under this subsection may be in effect for a borrower, the Secretary shall include all time periods during which a borrower of loans under part B, part D, or part E—
<br>
<br>(A) is not in default on any loan that is included in the income contingent repayment plan; and
<br>
<br>(B)(i) is in deferment due to an economic hardship described in section 1085(o) of this title;
<br>
<br>(ii) makes monthly payments under paragraph (1) or (6) of section 1098e(b) of this title;
<br>
<br>(iii) makes monthly payments of not less than the monthly amount calculated under section 1078(b)(9)(A)(i) of this title or subsection (d)(1)(A), based on a 10-year repayment period, when the borrower first made the election described in section 1098e(b)(1) of this title;
<br>
<br>(iv) makes payments of not less than the payments required under a standard repayment plan under section 1078(b)(9)(A)(i) of this title or subsection (d)(1)(A) with a repayment period of 10 years; or
<br>
<br>(v) makes payments under an income contingent repayment plan under subsection (d)(1)(D).
<br>(8) Automatic recertification
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall establish and implement, with respect to any borrower described in subparagraph (B), procedures to—
<br>
<br>(i) use return information disclosed under section 6103(l)(13) of title 26, pursuant to approval provided under section 1098h of this title, to determine the repayment obligation of the borrower without further action by the borrower;
<br>
<br>(ii) allow the borrower (or the spouse of the borrower), at any time, to opt out of disclosure under such section 6103(l)(13) and instead provide such information as the Secretary may require to determine the repayment obligation of the borrower (or withdraw from the repayment plan under this subsection); and
<br>
<br>(iii) provide the borrower with an opportunity to update the return information so disclosed before the determination of the repayment obligation of the borrower.
<br>(B) Applicability

<br>Subparagraph (A) shall apply to each borrower of a loan made under this part who, on or after the date on which the Secretary establishes procedures under such subparagraph—

<br>Section 1. Policy. The 2019 novel coronavirus known as SARS–CoV–2, the virus causing outbreaks of the disease COVID–19, has significantly disrupted the lives of Americans. In Proclamation 9994 of March 13, 2020 (Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID–19) Outbreak) [50 U.S.C. 1621 note], I declared, pursuant to the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), that the COVID–19 outbreak in the United States constituted a national emergency (the "national emergency"). The same day, I also determined that the COVID–19 outbreak constituted an emergency of nationwide scope, pursuant to section 501(b) of the Stafford Act (42 U.S.C. 5191(b)).
<br>
<br>On March 20, 2020, my Administration took action to provide immediate relief to tens of millions of student loan borrowers during the pandemic caused by COVID–19 by both suspending loan payments and temporarily setting interest rates to 0 percent. This relief has helped many students and parents retain financial stability. And many other Americans have continued to routinely pay down their student loan balances, to more quickly eliminate their loans in the long run. During this time, borrowers have been able to determine the best path forward for themselves.
<br>
<br>The original announcement of this policy specified that it would continue for at least 60 days. In the interim, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act [Pub. L. 116–136] provided this same student loan payment relief, but that program is scheduled to expire on September 30, 2020. Currently, many Americans remain unemployed due to the COVID–19 pandemic, and many more have accepted lower wages and reduced hours while States and localities continue to impose social distancing measures. It is therefore appropriate to extend this policy until such time that the economy has stabilized, schools have re-opened, and the crisis brought on by the COVID–19 pandemic has subsided.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. Extension of Student Loan Payment Relief. (a) In light of the national emergency declared on March 13, 2020, the Secretary of Education shall take action pursuant to applicable law to effectuate appropriate waivers of and modifications to the requirements and conditions of economic hardship deferments described in section 455(f)(2)(D) of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, 20 U.S.C. 1087e(f)(2)(D), and provide such deferments to borrowers as necessary to continue the temporary cessation of payments and the waiver of all interest on student loans held by the Department of Education until December 31, 2020.
<br>
<br>(b) All persons who wish to continue making student loan payments shall be allowed to do so, notwithstanding the deferments provided pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
<br>
<br>(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or
<br>
<br>(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
<br>
<br>(b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
<br>
<br>(c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
<br>
<br>(d) You are authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.
<br>

<br>1 So in original. Probably should be followed by a comma.
<br>
<br>2 So in original. The second comma probably should not appear.
<br>§1087f. Contracts
<br>(a) Contracts for supplies and services
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall, to the extent practicable, award contracts for origination, servicing, and collection described in subsection (b). In awarding such contracts, the Secretary shall ensure that such services and supplies are provided at competitive prices.
<br>(2) Entities
<br>
<br>The entities with which the Secretary may enter into contracts shall include only entities which the Secretary determines are qualified to provide such services and supplies and will comply with the procedures applicable to the award of such contracts. In the case of awarding contracts for the origination, servicing, and collection of loans under this part, the Secretary shall enter into contracts only with entities that have extensive and relevant experience and demonstrated effectiveness. The entities with which the Secretary may enter into such contracts shall include, where practicable, agencies with agreements with the Secretary under sections 1078(b) and (c) of this title, if such agencies meet the qualifications as determined by the Secretary under this subsection and if those agencies have such experience and demonstrated effectiveness. In awarding contracts to such State agencies, the Secretary shall, to the extent practicable and consistent with the purposes of this part, give special consideration to State agencies with a history of high quality performance to perform services for institutions of higher education within their State.
<br>(3) Rule of construction
<br>
<br>Nothing in this section shall be construed as a limitation of the authority of any State agency to enter into an agreement for the purposes of this section as a member of a consortium of State agencies.
<br>(b) Contracts for origination, servicing, and data systems
<br>
<br>The Secretary may enter into contracts for—
<br>
<br>(1) the alternative origination of loans to students attending institutions of higher education with agreements to participate in the program under this part (or their parents), if such institutions do not have agreements with the Secretary under section 1087d(b) of this title;
<br>
<br>(2) the servicing and collection of loans made or purchased under this part;
<br>
<br>(3) the establishment and operation of 1 or more data systems for the maintenance of records on all loans made or purchased under this part; and
<br>
<br>(4) such other aspects of the direct student loan program as the Secretary determines are necessary to ensure the successful operation of the program.
