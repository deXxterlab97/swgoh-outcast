<br>
<br>(B) meet national defense requirements; and
<br>
<br>(C) serve interstate and interregional travel and commerce.
<br>
<br>(2) Components.—The National Highway System described in paragraph (1) consists of the following:
<br>
<br>(A) The National Highway System depicted on the map submitted by the Secretary of Transportation to Congress with the report entitled "Pulling Together: The National Highway System and its Connections to Major Intermodal Terminals" and dated May 24, 1996, and modifications approved by the Secretary before the date of enactment of the MAP–21.
<br>
<br>(B) Other urban and rural principal arterial routes, and border crossings on those routes, that were not included on the National Highway System before the date of enactment of the MAP–21.
<br>
<br>(C) Other connector highways (including toll facilities) that were not included in the National Highway System before the date of enactment of the MAP–21 but that provide motor vehicle access between arterial routes on the National Highway System and a major intermodal transportation facility.
<br>
<br>(D) A strategic highway network that—
<br>
<br>(i) consists of a network of highways that are important to the United States strategic defense policy, that provide defense access, continuity, and emergency capabilities for the movement of personnel, materials, and equipment in both peacetime and wartime, and that were not included on the National Highway System before the date of enactment of the MAP–21;
<br>
<br>(ii) may include highways on or off the Interstate System; and
<br>
<br>(iii) shall be designated by the Secretary, in consultation with appropriate Federal agencies and the States.
<br>
<br>(E) Major strategic highway network connectors that—
<br>
<br>(i) consist of highways that provide motor vehicle access between major military installations and highways that are part of the strategic highway network but were not included on the National Highway System before the date of enactment of the MAP–21; and
<br>
<br>(ii) shall be designated by the Secretary, in consultation with appropriate Federal agencies and the States.
<br>
<br>(3) Modifications to nhs.—
<br>
<br>(A) In general.—The Secretary may make any modification to the National Highway System, including any modification consisting of a connector to a major intermodal terminal or the withdrawal of a road from that system, that is proposed by a State if the Secretary determines that the modification—
<br>
<br>(i) meets the criteria established for the National Highway System under this title after the date of enactment of the MAP–21; and
<br>
<br>(ii)(I) enhances the national transportation characteristics of the National Highway System; or
<br>
<br>(II) in the case of the withdrawal of a road, is reasonable and appropriate.
<br>
<br>(B) Cooperation.—
<br>
<br>(i) In general.—In proposing a modification under this paragraph, a State shall cooperate with local and regional officials.
<br>
<br>(ii) Urbanized areas.—In an urbanized area, the local officials shall act through the metropolitan planning organization designated for the area under section 134.

<br>(c) Interstate System.—
<br>
<br>(1) Description.—
<br>
<br>(A) In general.—The Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways within the United States (including the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico) consists of highways designed, located, and selected in accordance with this paragraph.
<br>
<br>(B) Design.—

<br>
<br>(ii) Exception.—Highways on the Interstate System in Alaska and Puerto Rico shall be designed in accordance with such geometric and construction standards as are adequate for current and probable future traffic demands and the needs of the locality of the highway.
<br>
<br>(C) Location.—Highways on the Interstate System shall be located so as—
<br>
<br>(i) to connect by routes, as direct as practicable, the principal metropolitan areas, cities, and industrial centers;
<br>
<br>(ii) to serve the national defense; and
<br>
<br>(iii) to the maximum extent practicable, to connect at suitable border points with routes of continental importance in Canada and Mexico.
<br>
<br>(D) Selection of routes.—To the maximum extent practicable, each route of the Interstate System shall be selected by joint action of the State transportation departments of the State in which the route is located and the adjoining States, in cooperation with local and regional officials, and subject to the approval of the Secretary.
<br>
<br>(2) Maximum mileage.—The mileage of highways on the Interstate System shall not exceed 43,000 miles, exclusive of designations under paragraph (4).

L. 93–643, §125(b), Jan. 4, 1975, 88 Stat. 2290, read prior to amendment by section 110 of Pub. L. 94–280 [see 1976 Amendment notes above] as follows: "Upon the joint request of a State Governor and the local governments concerned, the Secretary may withdraw his approval of any route or portion thereof on the Interstate System within any urbanized area in that State selected and approved in accordance with this title prior to the enactment of this paragraph, if he determines that such route or portion thereof is not essential to completion of a unified and connected Interstate System or will no longer be essential by reason of the application of this paragraph and will not be constructed as a part of the Interstate System, and if he receives assurances that the State does not intend to construct a toll road in the traffic corridor which would be served by such route or portion thereof. The mileage of the route or portion thereof approval of which is withdrawn under this paragraph shall be available for designation on the Interstate System in any other State in accordance with paragraph (1) of this subsection. After the Secretary has withdrawn his approval of any such route or portion thereof, whenever responsible local officials of such urbanized area notify the State highway department that, in lieu of a route or portion thereof approval for which is withdrawn under this paragraph, their needs require a nonhighway public mass transit project involving the construction of fixed rail facilities, or the purchase of passenger equipment, including rolling stock for any mode of mass transit, or both, and the State highway department determines that such public mass transit project is in accordance with the planning process under section 134 of this title and is entitled to priority under such planning process, such public mass transit project shall be submitted for approval to the Secretary. Approval of the plans, specifications, and estimates for such project by the Secretary shall be deemed a contractual obligation of the United States for payment out of the general funds in the Treasury of its proportional share of the cost of such project in an amount equal to the Federal share which would be paid for such a project under the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964 [section 1601 et seq. of Title 49, Transportation], except that the total Federal cost of all such projects under this paragraph with respect to such route or portion thereof approval of which is withdrawn under this paragraph, shall not exceed the Federal share of the cost which would have been paid for such route or portion thereof, as such cost is included in the 1972 Interstate System cost estimate set forth in table 5 of House Public Works Committee Print Numbered 92–29, as revised in House Report Numbered 92–1443, increased or decreased, as the case may be, as determined by the Secretary, based on changes in construction costs of such route or portion thereof as of the date of withdrawal of approval under this paragraph and in accordance with that design of such route or portion thereof which is the basis of such 1972 cost estimate. Funds apportioned to such State for the Interstate System, which apportionment is based upon an Interstate System cost estimate that includes a route or portion thereof approval of which is withdrawn under this paragraph, shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Federal share of such project as such share becomes a contractual obligation of the United States. No general funds shall be obligated under authority of this paragraph after June 30, 1981. No nonhighway public mass transit project shall be approved under this paragraph unless the Secretary has received assurances satisfactory to him from the State that public mass transportation systems will fully utilize the proposed project. The provision of assistance under this paragraph shall not be construed as bringing within the application of chapter 15 of title 5, United States Code [section 1501 et seq. of Title 5, Government Organization and Employees], any nonsupervisory employee of an urban mass transportation system (or of any other agency or entity performing related functions) to whom such chapter is otherwise inapplicable. Funds available for expenditure to carry out the purposes of this paragraph shall be supplementary to and not in substitution for funds authorized and available for obligation pursuant to the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964, as amended [section 1601 et seq. of Title 49, Transportation]. The provisions of section 3(e)(4) of the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964, as amended, [section 1602 (e)(4) of Title 49], shall apply in carrying out this paragraph."
