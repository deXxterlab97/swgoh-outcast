If he determines such increased unemployment has in fact resulted, or is in fact likely to result, from such competition, he shall make a full and complete report of his findings and determinations to the President and to the Congress: Provided, That he may also include in such report information on the increased employment resulting from additional exports in any industry under this chapter as he may determine to be pertinent to such report.

<br>
<br>"(4) The provisions of sections 205 and 208 of this title, relating to special industry committees, shall be applicable to review committees appointed under this subsection.

<br>(o) Compensatory time
<br>

<br>
<br>(2) A public agency may provide compensatory time under paragraph (1) only—
<br>
<br>(A) pursuant to—

<br>(i) applicable provisions of a collective bargaining agreement, memorandum of understanding, or any other agreement between the public agency and representatives of such employees; or
<br>
<br>(ii) in the case of employees not covered by subclause (i), an agreement or understanding arrived at between the employer and employee before the performance of the work; and
<br>
<br>(B) if the employee has not accrued compensatory time in excess of the limit applicable to the employee prescribed by paragraph (3).
<br>
<br>In the case of employees described in clause (A)(ii) hired prior to April 15, 1986, the regular practice in effect on April 15, 1986, with respect to compensatory time off for such employees in lieu of the receipt of overtime compensation, shall constitute an agreement or understanding under such clause (A)(ii). Except as provided in the previous sentence, the provision of compensatory time off to such employees for hours worked after April 14, 1986, shall be in accordance with this subsection.

Any such employee who, after April 15, 1986, has accrued 480 or 240 hours, as the case may be, of compensatory time off shall, for additional overtime hours of work, be paid overtime compensation.
<br>
<br>(B) If compensation is paid to an employee for accrued compensatory time off, such compensation shall be paid at the regular rate earned by the employee at the time the employee receives such payment.

<br>(4) An employee who has accrued compensatory time off authorized to be provided under paragraph (1) shall, upon termination of employment, be paid for the unused compensatory time at a rate of compensation not less than—
<br>
<br>(A) the average regular rate received by such employee during the last 3 years of the employee's employment, or
<br>
<br>(B) the final regular rate received by such employee,
<br>
<br>whichever is higher 3
<br>
<br>(5) An employee of a public agency which is a State, political subdivision of a State, or an interstate governmental agency—

<br>(A) who has accrued compensatory time off authorized to be provided under paragraph (1), and
<br>
<br>(B) who has requested the use of such compensatory time,
<br>
<br>shall be permitted by the employee's employer to use such time within a reasonable period after making the request if the use of the compensatory time does not unduly disrupt the operations of the public agency.
<br>
<br>(6) The hours an employee of a public agency performs court reporting transcript preparation duties shall not be considered as hours worked for the purposes of subsection (a) if—
<br>
<br>(A) such employee is paid at a per-page rate which is not less than—
<br>
<br>(i) the maximum rate established by State law or local ordinance for the jurisdiction of such public agency,
<br>
<br>(ii) the maximum rate otherwise established by a judicial or administrative officer and in effect on July 1, 1995, or

<br>
<br>(B) the terms "compensatory time" and "compensatory time off" mean hours during which an employee is not working, which are not counted as hours worked during the applicable workweek or other work period for purposes of overtime compensation, and for which the employee is compensated at the employee's regular rate.

<br>
<br>(1) If an individual who is employed by a State, political subdivision of a State, or an interstate governmental agency in fire protection or law enforcement activities (including activities of security personnel in correctional institutions) and who, solely at such individual's option, agrees to be employed on a special detail by a separate or independent employer in fire protection, law enforcement, or related activities, the hours such individual was employed by such separate and independent employer shall be excluded by the public agency employing such individual in the calculation of the hours for which the employee is entitled to overtime compensation under this section if the public agency—
<br>
<br>(A) requires that its employees engaged in fire protection, law enforcement, or security activities be hired by a separate and independent employer to perform the special detail,
<br>
<br>(B) facilitates the employment of such employees by a separate and independent employer, or
<br>
<br>(C) otherwise affects the condition of employment of such employees by a separate and independent employer.
<br>

<br>
<br>(3) If an individual who is employed in any capacity by a public agency which is a State, political subdivision of a State, or an interstate governmental agency, agrees, with the approval of the public agency and solely at the option of such individual, to substitute during scheduled work hours for another individual who is employed by such agency in the same capacity, the hours such employee worked as a substitute shall be excluded by the public agency in the calculation of the hours for which the employee is entitled to overtime compensation under this section.
<br>(q) Maximum hour exemption for employees receiving remedial education
<br>
<br>Any employer may employ any employee for a period or periods of not more than 10 hours in the aggregate in any workweek in excess of the maximum workweek specified in subsection (a) without paying the compensation for overtime employment prescribed in such subsection, if during such period or periods the employee is receiving remedial education that is—
<br>
<br>(1) provided to employees who lack a high school diploma or educational attainment at the eighth grade level;

<br>
<br>(B) a place, other than a bathroom, that is shielded from view and free from intrusion from coworkers and the public, which may be used by an employee to express breast milk.
<br>
<br>(2) An employer shall not be required to compensate an employee receiving reasonable break time under paragraph (1) for any work time spent for such purpose.
<br>
<br>(3) An employer that employs less than 50 employees shall not be subject to the requirements of this subsection, if such requirements would impose an undue hardship by causing the employer significant difficulty or expense when considered in relation to the size, financial resources, nature, or structure of the employer's business.
<br>
<br>(4) Nothing in this subsection shall preempt a State law that provides greater protections to employees than the protections provided for under this subsection.
