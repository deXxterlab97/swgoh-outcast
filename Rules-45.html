<br>If any man be found soliciting his brother of the children of Israel, and selling him shall take a price, he shall be put to death, and thou shalt take away the evil from the midst of thee.
<br>Observe diligently that thou incur not the stroke of the leprosy, but thou shalt do what- soever the priests of the Levitical race shall teach thee, according to what I have commanded them, and fulfil thou it carefully.
<br> 
<br>Remember what the Lord your God did to Mary, in the way when you came out of Egypt. 10 When thou shalt demand of thy neighbour any thing that he oweth thee, thou shalt not go
<br>into his house to take away a pledge:
<br>But thou shalt stand without, and he shall bring out to thee what he hath.
<br>But if he be poor, the pledge shall not lodge with thee that night,
<br>But thou shalt restore it to him presently before the going down of the sun: that he may sleep in his own raiment and bless thee, and thou mayst have justice before the Lord thy God.
<br>Thou shalt not refuse the hire of the needy, and the poor, whether he be thy brother, or a stranger that dwelleth with thee in the land, and is within thy gates:
<br>But thou shalt pay him the price of his labour the same day, before the going down of the sun, because he is poor, and with it main- taineth his life: lest he cry against thee to the Lord, and it be reputed to thee for a sin.
<br>The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children for the fathers, but every one shall die for his own sin,
<br>Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger nor of the fatherless, neither shalt thou take away the widow’s raiment for a pledge.
<br>Remember that thou wast a slave in Egypt, and the Lord thy God delivered thee from thence. Therefore I command thee to do this thing.
<br>When thou hast reaped the corn in thy field, and hast forgot and left a sheaf, thou shalt not return to take it away: but thou shalt suffer the stranger, and the fatherless and the widow to take it away: that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all the works of thy hands.
<br>If thou have gathered the fruit of thy olive trees, thou shalt not return to gather whatsoever
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>remaineth on the trees: but shalt leave it for the stranger, for the fatherless, and the widow.
<br>If thou make the vintage of thy vineyard, thou shalt not gather the clusters that remain, but they shall be for the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow.
<br>Remember that thou also wast a bondman in Egypt, and therefore I command thee to do this thing.
<br>
<br>Chapter 25
<br>If there be a controversy between men, and they call upon the judges: they shall give the prize of justice to him whom they perceive to be just: and him whom they find to be wicked, they shall condemn of wickedness.
<br>And if they see that the offender be worthy of stripes: they shall lay him down, and shall cause him to be beaten before them. According to the measure of the sin shall the measure also of the stripes be:
<br>Yet so, that they exceed not the number of forty: lest thy brother depart shamefully torn before thy eyes.
<br>Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out thy corn on the floor.
<br>When brethren dwell together, and one of them dieth without children, the wife of the deceased shall not marry to another: but his brother shall take her, and raise up seed for his brother:
<br>And the first son he shall have of her he shall call by his name, that his name be not abolished out of Israel.
<br>But if he will not take his brother’s wife, who by law belongeth to him, the woman shall go to the gate of the city, and call upon the ancients, and say: My husband’s brother refuseth to raise
<br> 
<br>up his brother’s name in Israel: and will not take me to wife.
<br>And they shall cause him to be sent for forth- with, and shall ask him. If he answer: I will not take her to wife:
<br>The woman shall come to him before the ancients, and shall take off his shoe from his foot, and spit in his face, and say: So shall it be done to the man that will not build up his brother’s house:
<br>And his name shall be called in Israel, the house of the unshod.
<br>If two men have words together, and one begin to fight against the other, and the other’s wife willing to deliver her husband out of the hand of the stronger, shall put forth her hand, and take him by the secrets,
<br>Thou shalt cut off her hand, neither shalt thou be moved with any pity in her regard.
<br>Thou shalt not have divers weights in thy bag, a greater and a less:
<br>Neither shall there be in thy house a greater bushel and a less.
<br>Thou shalt have a just and a true weight, and thy bushel shall be equal and true: that thou mayest live a long time upon the land which the Lord thy God shall give thee.
<br>For the Lord thy God abhorreth him that doth these things, and he hateth all injustice.
<br>Remember what Amalec did to thee in the way when thou camest out of Egypt:
<br>How he met thee: and slew the hindmost of the army, who sat down, being weary, when thou wast spent with hunger and labour, and he feared not God.
<br>Therefore when the Lord thy God shall give thee rest, and shall have subdued all the nations round about in the land which he hath promised thee: thou shalt blot out his name from under heaven. See thou forget it not.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 26
<br>And when thou art come into the land which the Lord thy God will give thee to possess, and hast conquered it, and dwellest in it:
<br>Thou shalt take the first of all thy fruits, and put them in a basket, and shalt go to the place which the Lord thy God shall choose, that his name may be invocated there:
<br>And thou shalt go to the priest that shall be in those days, and say to him: I profess this day before the Lord thy God, that I am come into the land, for which he swore to our fathers, that he would give it us.
<br>And the priest taking the basket at thy hand, shall set it before the altar of the Lord thy God:
<br>And thou shalt speak thus in the sight of the Lord thy God: The Syrian pursued my father, who went down into Egypt, and sojourned there in a very small number, and grew into a nation great and strong and of an infinite multitude.
<br>And the Egyptians afflicted us, and perse- cuted us, laying on us most grievous burdens:
<br>And we cried to the Lord God of our fa- thers: who heard us, and looked down upon our affliction, and labour, and distress:
<br>And brought us out of Egypt with a strong hand, and a stretched out arm, with great terror, with signs and wonders:
<br>And brought us into this place, and gave us this land flowing with milk and honey.
<br>And therefore now I offer the firstfruits of the land which the Lord hath given me. And thou shalt leave them in the sight of the Lord thy God, adoring the Lord thy God.
<br>And thou shalt feast in all the good things which the Lord thy God hath given thee, and thy house, thou and the Levite, and the stranger that is with thee.
<br> 
<br>When thou hast made an end of tithing all thy fruits, in the third year of tithes thou shalt give it to the Levite, and to the stanger, and to the fatherless, and to the widow, that they may eat within thy gates, and be filled:
<br>And thou shalt speak thus in the sight of the Lord thy God: I have taken that which was sanctified out of my house, and I have given it to the Levite, and to the stranger, and to the fatherless, and to the widow, as thou hast com- manded me: I have not transgressed thy com- mandments nor forgotten thy precepts.
<br>I have not eaten of them in my mourn- ing, nor separated them for any uncleanness, nor spent any thing of them in funerals. I have obeyed the voice of the Lord my God, and have done all things as thou hast commanded me.
<br>Look from thy sanctuary, and thy high habitation of heaven, and bless thy people Is- rael, and the land which thou hast given us, as thou didst swear to our fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey.
<br>This day the Lord thy God hath com- manded thee to do these commandments and judgments: and to keep and fulfil them with all thy heart, and with all thy soul.
<br>Thou hast chosen the Lord this day to be thy God, and to walk in his ways and keep his ceremonies, and precepts, and judgments, and obey his command.
<br>And the Lord hath chosen thee this day, to be his peculiar people, as he hath spoken to thee, and to keep all his commandments:
<br>And to make thee higher than all nations which he hath created, to his own praise, and name, and glory: that thou mayst be a holy peo- ple of the Lord thy God, as he hath spoken.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 27
<br>And Moses with the ancients of Israel com- manded the people, saying: Keep every com- mandment that I command you this day.
<br>And when you are passed over the Jordan into the land which the Lord thy God will give thee, thou shalt set up great stones, and shalt plaster them over with plaster,
<br>That thou mayst write on them all the words of this law, when thou art passed over the Jor- dan: that thou mayst enter into the land which the Lord thy God will give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, as he swore to thy fathers. 4 Therefore when you are passed over the Jor- dan, set up the stones which I command you this day, in mount Hebal, and thou shalt plaster
<br>them with plaster:
<br>And thou shalt build there an altar to the Lord thy God, of stones which iron hath not touched,
<br>And of stones not fashioned nor polished: and thou shalt offer upon it holocausts to the Lord thy God:
<br>And shalt immolate peace victims, and eat there, and feast before the Lord thy God.
<br>And thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law plainly and clearly.
<br>And Moses and the priests of the race of Levi said to all Israel: Attend, and hear, O Israel: This day thou art made the people of the Lord thy God:
<br>Thou shalt hear his voice, and do the com- mandments and justices which I command thee. 11 And Moses commanded the people in that
<br>day, saying:
<br>12 These shall stand upon mount Garizim to bless the people, when you are passed the Jor- dan: Simeon, Levi, Juda, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin.
<br> 
<br>And over against them shall stand on mount Hebal to curse: Ruben, Gad, and Aser, and Zabulon, Dan, and Nephtali.
<br>And the Levites shall pronounce, and say to all the men of Israel with a loud voice:
<br>Cursed be the man that maketh a graven and molten thing, the abomination of the Lord, the work of the hands of artificers, and shall put it in a secret place: and all the people shall an- swer and say: Amen.
<br>Cursed be he that honoureth not his father and mother: and all the people shall say: Amen. 17 Cursed be he that removeth his neighbour’s
<br>landmarks: and all the people shall say: Amen.
<br>Cursed be he that maketh the blind to wan- der out of his way: and all the people shall say: Amen.
<br>Cursed be he that perverteth the judgment of the stranger, of the fatherless and the widow: and all the people shall say: Amen.
<br>Cursed be he that lieth with his father’s wife, and uncovereth his bed: and all the people shall say: Amen.
<br>Cursed be he that lieth with any beast: and all the people shall say: Amen.
<br>Cursed be he that lieth with his sister, the daughter of his father, or of his mother: and all the people shall say: Amen.
<br>Cursed be he that lieth with his mother- in-law: and all the people shall say: Amen.
<br>Cursed be he that secretly killeth his neigh- bour: and all the people shall say: Amen.
<br>Cursed be he that taketh gifts, to slay an innocent person: and all the people shall say: Amen.
<br>Cursed be he that abideth not in the words of this law, and fulfilleth them not in work: and all the people shall say: Amen.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 28
<br>Now if thou wilt hear the voice of all his com- mandments, which I command thee this day, the Lord thy God will make thee higher than all the nations that are on the earth.
<br>And all these blessings shall come upon thee and overtake thee: yet so if thou hear his pre- cepts.
<br>Blessed shalt thou be in the city, and blessed in the field.
<br>Blessed shall be the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy ground, and the fruit of thy cat- tle, the droves of thy herds, and the folds of thy sheep.
<br>Blessed shall be thy barns and blessed thy stores.
<br>Blessed shalt thou be coming in and going out.
<br>The Lord shall cause thy enemies, that rise up against thee, to fall down before thy face: one way shall they come out against thee, and seven ways shall they flee before thee.
<br>The Lord will send forth a blessing upon thy storehouses, and upon all the works of thy hands: and will bless thee in the land that thou shalt receive.
<br>The Lord will raise thee up to be a holy people to himself, as he swore to thee: if thou keep the commandments of the Lord thy God, and walk in his ways.
<br>And all the people of the earth shall see that the name of the Lord is invocated upon thee, and they shall fear thee.
<br>The Lord will make thee abound with all goods, with the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy cattle, with the fruit of thy land, which the Lord swore to thy fathers that he would give thee.
<br>The Lord will open his excellent treasure,
<br> 
<br>the heaven, that it may give rain in due season: and he will bless all the works of thy hands. And thou shalt lend to many nations, and shalt not borrow of any one.
<br>And the Lord shall make thee the head and not the tail: and thou shalt be always above, and not beneath: yet so if thou wilt hear the com- mandments of the Lord thy God which I com- mand thee this day, and keep and do them,
<br>And turn not away from them neither to the right hand, nor to the left, nor follow strange gods, nor worship them.
<br>But if thou wilt not hear the voice of the Lord thy God, to keep and to do all his com- mandments and ceremonies, which I command thee this day, all these curses shall come upon thee, and overtake thee.
<br>Cursed shalt thou be in the city, cursed in the field.
<br>Cursed shall be thy barn, and cursed thy stores.
<br>Cursed shall be the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy ground, the herds of thy oxen, and the flocks of thy sheep.
<br>Cursed shalt thou be coming in, and cursed going out.
<br>The Lord shall send upon thee famine and hunger, and a rebuke upon all the works which thou shalt do: until he consume and destroy thee quickly, for thy most wicked inventions, by which thou hast forsaken me.
<br>21 May the Lord set the pestilence upon thee, until he consume thee out of the land, which thou shalt go in to possess.
<br>22 May the Lord afflict thee with miserable want, with the fever and with cold, with burning and with heat, and with corrupted air and with blasting, and pursue thee till thou perish.
<br>23 Be the heaven, that is over thee, of brass: and the ground thou treadest on, of iron.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>24	The Lord give thee dust for rain upon thy land, and let ashes come down from heaven upon thee, till thou be consumed.
<br>25	The Lord make thee to fall down before thy enemies, one way mayst thou go out against them, and flee seven ways, and be scattered throughout all the kingdoms of the earth.
<br>26	And be thy carcass meat for all the fowls of the air, and the beasts of the earth, and be there none to drive them away.
<br>27	The Lord strike thee with the ulcer of Egypt, and the part of thy body, by which the dung is cast out, with the scab and with the itch: so that thou canst not be healed.
<br>28	The Lord strike thee with madness and blindness and fury of mind.
<br>29	And mayst thou grope at midday as the blind is wont to grope in the dark, and not make straight thy ways. And mayst thou at all times suffer wrong, and be oppressed with violence, and mayst thou have no one to deliver thee.
<br>30	Mayst thou take a wife, and another sleep with her. Mayst thou build a house, and not dwell therein. Mayest thou plant a vineyard and not gather the vintage thereof.
<br>31 May thy ox be slain before thee, and thou not eat thereof.   May thy ass be taken away in thy sight, and not restored to thee. May thy sheep be given to thy enemies, and may there be none to help thee.
<br>May thy sons and thy daughters be given to another people, thy eyes looking on, and lan- guishing at the sight of them all the day, and may there be no strength in thy hand.
<br>May a people which thou knowest not, eat the fruits of thy land, and all thy labours: and mayst thou always suffer oppression, and be crushed at all times.
<br>And be astonished at the terror of those things which thy eyes shall see:
<br> 
<br>May the Lord strike thee with a very sore ulcer in the knees and in the legs, and be thou incurable from the sole of the foot to the top of the head.
<br>The Lord shall bring thee, and thy king, whom thou shalt have appointed over thee, into a nation which thou and thy fathers know not: and there thou shalt serve strange gods, wood and stone.
<br>And thou shalt be lost, as a proverb and a byword to all people, among whom the Lord shall bring thee in.
<br>Thou shalt cast much seed into the ground, and gather little: because the locusts shall con- sume all.
<br>Thou shalt plant a vineyard, and dig it, and shalt not drink the wine, nor gather any thing thereof: because it shall be wasted with worms.
<br>Thou shalt have olive trees in all thy bor- ders, and shalt not be anointed with the oil: for the olives shall fall off and perish.
<br>Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, and shalt not enjoy them: because they shall be led into captivity.
<br>The blast shall consume all the trees and the fruits of thy ground.
<br>The stranger that liveth with thee in the land, shall rise up over thee, and shall be higher: and thou shalt go down, and be lower.
<br>He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him. He shall be as the head, and thou shalt be the tail.
<br>And all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall pursue and overtake thee, till thou per- ish: because thou heardst not the voice of the Lord thy God, and didst not keep his command- ments and ceremonies which he commanded thee.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>And they shall be as signs and wonders on thee, and on thy seed for ever.
<br>Because thou didst not serve the Lord thy God with joy and gladness of heart, for the abun- dance of all things:
<br>Thou shalt serve thy enemy, whom the Lord will send upon thee, in hunger, and thirst, and nakedness, and in want of all things: and he shall put an iron yoke upon thy neck, till he consume thee.
<br>The Lord will bring upon thee a nation from afar, and from the uttermost ends of the earth, like an eagle that flyeth swiftly, whose tongue thou canst not understand,
<br>A most insolent nation, that will shew no regard to the ancients, nor have pity on the in- fant,
<br>And will devour the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruits of thy land: until thou be destroyed, and will leave thee no wheat, nor wine, nor oil, nor herds of oxen, nor flocks of sheep: until he destroy thee.
<br>And consume thee in all thy cities, and thy strong and high wall be brought down, wherein thou trustedst in all thy land. Thou shalt be besieged within thy gates in all thy land which the Lord thy God will give thee:
<br>And thou shalt eat the fruit of thy womb, and the flesh of thy sons and of thy daugh- ters, which the Lord thy God shall give thee, in the distress and extremity wherewith thy enemy shall oppress thee.
<br>The man that is nice among you, and very delicate, shall envy his own brother, and his wife, that lieth in his bosom,
<br>So that he will not give them of the flesh of his children, which he shall eat: because he hath nothing else in the siege and the want, where- with thy enemies shall distress thee within all thy gates.
<br> 
<br>The tender and delicate woman, that could not go upon the ground, nor set down her foot for over much niceness and tenderness, will envy her husband who lieth in her bosom, the flesh of her son, and of her daughter,
<br>And the filth of the afterbirths, that come forth from between her thighs, and the children that are born the same hour. For they shall eat them secretly for the want of all things, in the siege and distress, wherewith thy enemy shall oppress thee within thy gates.
<br>If thou wilt not keep, and fulfil all the words of this law, that are written in this volume, and fear his glorious and terrible name: that is, The Lord thy God:
<br>The Lord shall increase thy plagues, and the plagues of thy seed, plagues great and last- ing, infirmities grievous and perpetual.
<br>And he shall bring back on thee all the afflictions of Egypt, which thou wast afraid of, and they shall stick fast to thee.
<br>Moreover the Lord will bring upon thee all the diseases, and plagues, that are not written in the volume of this law till he consume thee:
<br>And you shall remain few in number, who before were as the stars of heaven for multitude, because thou heardst not the voice of the Lord thy God.
<br>And as the Lord rejoiced upon you be- fore doing good to you, and multiplying you: so he shall rejoice destroying and bringing you to nought, so that you shall be taken away from the land which thou shalt go in to possess.
<br>The Lord shall scatter thee among all peo- ple, from the farthest parts of the earth to the ends thereof: and there thou shalt serve strange gods, which both thou art ignorant of and thy fathers, wood and stone.
<br>Neither shalt thou be quiet, even in those nations, nor shall there be any rest for the sole
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>of thy foot. For the Lord will give thee a fearful heart, and languishing eyes, and a soul consumed with pensiveness:
<br>And thy life shall be as it were hanging be- fore thee. Thou shalt fear night and day, neither shalt thou trust thy life.
<br>In the morning thou shalt say: Who will grant me evening? and at evening: Who will grant me morning?	for the fearfulness of thy heart, wherewith thou shalt be terrified, and for those things which thou shalt see with thy eyes. 68 The Lord shall bring thee again with ships into Egypt, by the way whereof he said to thee that thou shouldst see it no more. There shalt thou be set to sale to thy enemies for bondmen
<br>and bondwomen, and no man shall buy you.
<br>
<br>Chapter 29
<br>These are the words of the covenant which the Lord commanded Moses to make with the chil- dren of Israel in the land of Moab: beside that covenant which he made with them in Horeb.
<br>And Moses called all Israel, and said to them: You have seen all the things that the Lord did before you in the land of Egypt to Pharao, and to all his servants, and to his whole land.
<br>The great temptations, which thy eyes have seen, those mighty signs and wonders,
<br>And the Lord hath not given you a heart to understand, and eyes to see, and ears that may hear, unto this present day.
<br>He hath brought you forty years through the desert: your garments are not worn out, neither are the shoes of your feet consumed with age.
<br>You have not eaten bread, nor have you drunk wine or strong drink: that you might know that I am the Lord your God.
<br>And you came to this place: and Sehon king
<br> 
<br>of Hesebon, and Og king of Basan, came out against us to fight. And we slew them.
<br>And took their land, and delivered it for a possession to Ruben and Gad, and the half tribe of Manasses.
<br>Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and fulfil them: that you may understand all that you do.
<br>You all stand this day before the Lord your God, your princes, and tribes, and ancients, and doctors, all the people of Israel,
<br>Your children and your wives, and the stranger that abideth with thee in the camp, be- sides the hewers of wood, and them that bring water:
<br>That thou mayst pass in the covenant of the Lord thy God, and in the oath which this day the Lord thy God maketh with thee.
<br>That he may raise thee up a people to him- self, and he may be thy God as he hath spoken to thee, and as he swore to thy fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
<br>Neither with you only do I make this covenant, and confirm these oaths,
<br>But with all that are present and that are absent.
<br>For you know how we dwelt in the land of Egypt, and how we have passed through the midst of nations, and passing through them,
<br>You have seen their abominations and filth, that is to say, their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which they worshipped.
<br>Lest perhaps there should be among you a man or a woman, a family or a tribe, whose heart is turned away this day from the Lord our God, to go and serve the gods of those nations: and there should be among you a root bringing forth gall and bitterness.
<br>And when he shall hear the words of this oath, he should bless himself in his heart say-
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>ing: I shall have peace, and will walk on in the naughtiness of my heart: and the drunken may consume the thirsty,
<br>And the Lord should not forgive him: but his wrath and jealousy against that man should be exceedingly enkindled at that time, and all the curses that are written in this volume should light upon him: and the Lord should blot out his name from under heaven,
<br>And utterly destroy him out of all the tribes of Israel, according to the curses that are contained in the book of this law and covenant: 22 And the following generation shall say, and the children that shall be born hereafter, and the strangers that shall come from afar, seeing the plagues of that land and the evils wherewith the
<br>Lord hath afflicted it,
<br>Burning it with brimstone, and the heat of salt, so that it cannot be sown any more, nor any green thing grow therein, after the exam- ple of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrha, Adama and Seboim, which the Lord destroyed in his wrath and indignation:
<br>And all the nations shall say: Why hath the Lord done thus to this land? what meaneth this exceeding great heat of his wrath?
<br>And they shall answer: Because they for- sook the covenant of the Lord, which he made with their fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt:
<br>And they have served strange gods, and adored them, whom they knew not, and for whom they had not been assigned:
<br>Therefore the wrath of the Lord was kin- dled against this land, to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this volume:
<br>And he hath cast them out of their land, in anger and in wrath, and in very great indigna- tion, and hath thrown them into a strange land, as it is seen this day.
<br> 
<br>Secret things to the Lord our God: things that are manifest, to us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.
<br>
<br>Chapter 30
<br>Now when all these things shall be come upon thee, the blessing or the curse, which I have set forth before thee, and thou shalt be touched with repentance of thy heart among all the nations, into which the Lord thy God shall have scattered thee,
<br>And shalt return to him, and obey his com- mandments, as I command thee this day, thou and thy children, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul:
<br>The Lord thy God will bring back again thy captivity, and will have mercy on thee, and gather thee again out of all the nations, into which he scattered thee before.
<br>If thou be driven as far as the poles of heaven, the Lord thy God will fetch thee back from hence,
<br>And will take thee to himself, and bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it: and blessing thee, he will make thee more numerous than were thy fathers. 6 The Lord thy God will circumcise thy heart, and the heart of thy seed: that thou mayst love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all
<br>thy soul, that thou mayst live.
<br>And he will turn all these curses upon thy enemies, and upon them that hate and persecute thee.
<br>But thou shalt return, and hear the voice of the Lord thy God, and shalt do all the com- mandments which I command thee this day:
<br>And the Lord thy God will make thee abound in all the works of thy hands, in the fruit
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>of thy womb, and in the fruit of thy cattle, in the fruitfulness of thy land, and in the plenty of all things. For the Lord will return to rejoice over thee in all good things, as he rejoiced in thy fa- thers:
<br>Yet so if thou hear the voice of the Lord thy God, and keep his precepts and ceremonies, which are written in this law: and return to the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul.
<br>This commandment, that I command thee this day is not above thee, nor far off from thee: 12 Nor is it in heaven, that thou shouldst say:
<br>Which of us can go up to heaven to bring it unto us, and we may hear and fulfil it in work?
<br>Nor is it beyond the sea: that thou mayst excuse thyself, and say: Which of us can cross the sea, and bring it unto us: that we may hear, and do that which is commanded?
<br>But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart, that thou mayst do it. 15 Consider that I have set before thee this day life and good, and on the other hand death
<br>and evil:
<br>That thou mayst love the Lord thy God, and walk in his ways, and keep his command- ments and ceremonies and judgments, and bless thee in the land, which thou shalt go in to pos- sess.
<br>But if thy heart be turned away, so that thou wilt not hear, and being deceived with error thou adore strange gods, and serve them:
<br>I foretell thee this day that thou shalt per- ish, and shalt remain but a short time in the land, to which thou shalt pass over the Jordan, and shalt go in to possess it.
<br>I call heaven and earth to witness this day, that I have set before you life and death, bless- ing and cursing. Choose therefore life, that both thou and thy seed may live:
<br> 
<br>And that thou mayst love the Lord thy God, and obey his voice, and adhere to him (for he is thy life, and the length of thy days,) that thou mayst dwell in the land, for which the Lord swore to thy fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob that he would give it them.
<br>
<br>Chapter 31
<br>And Moses went, and spoke all these words to all Israel,
<br>And he said to them: I am this day a hun- dred and twenty years old, I can no longer go out and come in, especially as the Lord also hath said to me: Thou shalt not pass over this Jordan.
<br>The Lord thy God then will pass over be- fore thee: he will destroy all these nations in thy sight, and thou shalt possess them: and this Jo- sue shall go over before thee, as the Lord hath spoken.
<br>And the Lord shall do to them as he did to Sehon and Og the kings of the Amorrhites, and to their land, and shall destroy them.
<br>Therefore when the Lord shall have delivered these also to you, you shall do in like manner to them as I have commmanded you.
<br>Do manfully and be of good heart: fear not, nor be ye dismayed at their sight: for the Lord thy God he himself is thy leader, and will not leave thee nor forsake thee.
<br>And Moses called Josue, and said to him be- fore all Israel: Take courage, and be valiant: for thou shalt bring this people into the land which the Lord swore he would give to their fathers, and thou shalt divide it by lot.
<br>And the Lord who is your leader, he himself will be with thee: he will not leave thee, nor forsake thee: fear not, neither be dismayed.
<br>And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>to the priests the sons of Levi, who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and to all the ancients of Israel.
<br>And he commanded them, saying: After seven years, in the year of remission, in the feast of tabernacles,
<br>When all Israel come together, to appear in the sight of the Lord thy God in the place which the Lord shall choose, thou shalt read the words of this law before all Israel, in their hearing.
<br>And the people being all assembled to- gether, both men and women, children and strangers, that are within thy gates: that hear- ing they may learn, and fear the Lord your God, and keep, and fulfil all the words of this law:
<br>That their children also, who now are ig- norant, may hear, and fear the Lord their God, all the days that they live in the land whither you are going over the Jordan to possess it.
<br>And the Lord said to Moses: Behold the days of thy death are nigh: call Josue, and stand ye in the tabernacle of the testimony, that I may give him a charge. So Moses and Josue went and stood in the tabernacle of the testimony:
<br>And the Lord appeared there in the pil- lar of a cloud, which stood in the entry of the tabernacle.
<br>And the Lord said to Moses: Behold thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, and this people ris- ing up will go a fornicating after strange gods in the land, to which it goeth in to dwell: there will they forsake me, and will make void the covenant, which I have made with them,
<br>And my wrath shall be kindled against them in that day: and I will forsake them, and will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured: all evils and afflictions shall find them, so that they shall say in that day: In truth it is because God is not with me, that these evils have found me.
<br> 
<br>But I will hide, and cover my face in that day, for all the evils which they have done, be- cause they have followed strange gods.
<br>Now therefore write you this canticle, and teach the children of Israel: that they may know it by heart, and sing it by mouth, and this song may be unto me for a testimony among the chil- dren of Israel.
<br>For I will bring them into the land, for which I swore to their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey. And when they have eaten, and are full and fat, they will turn away after strange gods, and will serve them: and will despise me, and make void my covenant.
<br>And after many evils and afflictions shall have come upon them, this canticle shall answer them for a testimony, which no oblivion shall take away out of the mouth of their seed. For I know their thoughts, and what they are about to do this day, before that I bring them into the land which I have promised them.
<br>Moses therefore wrote the canticle, and taught it to the children of Israel.
<br>And the Lord commanded Josue the son of Nun, and said: Take courage, and be valiant: for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I have promised, and I will be with thee.
<br>Therefore after Moses had wrote the words of this law in a volume, and finished it:
<br>He commanded the Levites, who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord, saying:
<br>Take this book, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God: that it may be there for a testimony against thee.
<br>For I know thy obstinacy, and thy most stiff neck. While I am yet living, and going in with you, you have always been rebellious against the Lord: how much more when I shall be dead?
<br>Gather unto me all the ancients of your
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>tribes, and your doctors, and I will speak these words in their hearing, and will call heaven and earth to witness against them.
<br>For I know that, after my death, you will do wickedly, and will quickly turn aside form the way that I have commanded you: and evils shall come upon you in the latter times, when you shall do evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him by the works of your hands.
<br>Moses therefore spoke, in the hearing of the whole assembly of Israel, the words of this canticle, and finished it even to the end.
<br>
<br>Chapter 32
<br>Hear, O ye heavens, the things I speak, let the earth give ear to the words of my mouth.
<br>Let my doctrine gather as the rain, let my speech distil as the dew, as a shower upon the herb, and as drops upon the grass.
<br>Because I will invoke the name of the Lord: give ye magnificence to our God.
<br>The works of God are perfect, and all his ways are judgments: God is faithful and without any iniquity, he is just and right.
<br>They have sinned against him, and are none of his children in their filth: they are a wicked and perverse generation.
<br>Is this the return thou makest to the Lord, O foolish and senseless people? Is not he thy father, that hath possessed thee, and made thee, and created thee?
<br>Remember the days of old, think upon every generation: ask thy father, and he will declare to thee: thy elders and they will tell thee.
<br>When the Most High divided the nations: when he separated the sons of Adam, he ap- pointed the bounds of people according to the number of the children of Israel.
<br> 
<br>But the Lord’s portion is his people: Jacob the lot of his inheritance.
<br>He found him in a desert land, in a place of horror, and of vast wilderness: he led him about, and taught him: and he kept him as the apple of his eye.
<br>As the eagle enticing her young to fly, and hovering over them, he spread his wings, and hath taken him and carried him on his shoulders. 12 The Lord alone was his leader: and there
<br>was no strange god with him.
<br>He set him upon high land: that he might eat the fruits of the fields, that he might suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the hardest stone,
<br>Butter of the herd, and milk of the sheep with the fat of lambs, and of the rams of the breed of Basan: and goats with the marrow of wheat, and might drink the purest blood of the grape.
<br>The beloved grew fat, and kicked: he grew fat, and thick and gross, he forsook God who made him, and departed from God his saviour.
<br>They provoked him by strange gods, and stirred him up to anger, with their abominations. 17 They sacrificed to devils and not to God: to gods whom they knew not: that were newly
<br>come up, whom their fathers worshipped not.
<br>Thou hast forsaken the God that begot thee, and hast forgotten the Lord that created thee.
<br>The Lord saw, and was moved to wrath: because his own sons and daughters provoked him.
<br>And he said: I will hide my face from them, and will consider what their last end shall be: for it is a perverse generation, and unfaithful chil- dren.
<br>They have provoked me with that which was no god, and have angered me with their van-
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>ities: and I will provoke them with that which is no people, and will vex them with a foolish nation.
<br>A fire is kindled in my wrath, and shall burn even to the lowest hell: and shall devour the earth with her increase, and shall burn the foundations of the mountains.
<br>I will heap evils upon them, and will spend my arrows among them.
<br>They shall be consumed with famine, and birds shall devour them with a most bitter bite: I will send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the fury of creatures that trail upon the ground, and of serpents.
<br>Without, the sword shall lay them waste, and terror within, both the young man and the virgin, the sucking child with the man in years. 26 I said: Where are they? I will make the
<br>memory of them to cease from among men.
<br>But for the wrath of the enemies I have deferred it: lest perhaps their enemies might be proud, and should say: Our mighty hand, and not the Lord, hath done all these things.
<br>They are a nation without counsel, and without wisdom.
<br>O that they would be wise and would un- derstand, and would provide for their last end.
<br>How should one pursue after a thousand, and two chase ten thousand? Was it not, because their God had sold them, and the Lord had shut them up?
<br>For our God is not as their gods: our ene- mies themselves are judges.
<br>Their vines are of the vineyard of Sodom, and of the suburbs of Gomorrha: their grapes are grapes of gall, and their clusters most bitter. 33 Their wine is the gall of dragons, and the
<br>venom of asps, which is incurable.
<br>Are not these things stored up with me, and sealed up in my treasures?
<br> 
<br>Revenge is mine, and I will repay them in due time, that their foot may slide: the day of destruction is at hand, and the time makes haste to come.
<br>The Lord will judge his people, and will have mercy on his servants: he shall see that their hand is weakened, and that they who were shut up have also failed, and they that remained are consumed.
<br>And he shall say: Where are their gods, in whom they trusted?
<br>Of whose victims they ate the fat, and drank the wine of their drink offerings: let them arise and help you, and protect you in your dis- tress.
<br>See ye that I alone am, and there is no other God besides me: I will kill and I will make to live: I will strike, and I will heal, and there is none that can deliver out of my hand.
<br>I will lift up my hand to heaven, and I will say: I live for ever.
<br>If I shall whet my sword as the lightning, and my hand take hold on judgment: I will ren- der vengeance to my enemies, and repay them that hate me.
<br>I will make my arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh, of the blood of the slain and of the captivity, of the bare head of the enemies.
<br>Praise his people, ye nations, for he will revenge the blood of his servants: and will ren- der vengeance to their enemies, and he will be merciful to the land of his people.
<br>So Moses came and spoke all the words of this canticle in the ears of the people, and Josue the son of Nun.
<br>And he ended all these words, speaking to all Israel.
<br>And he said to them: Set your hearts on all the words, which I testify to you this day: which
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>you shall command your children to observe and to do, and to fulfil all that is written in this law: 47 For they are not commanded you in vain, but that every one should live in them, and that doing them you may continue a long time in the land whither you are going over the Jordan to
<br>possess it.
<br>And the Lord spoke to Moses the same day, saying:
<br>Go up into this mountain Abarim, (that is to say, of passages,) unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab over against Jericho: and see the land of Chanaan, which I will deliver to the children of Israel to possess, and die thou in the mountain.
<br>When thou art gone up into it thou shalt be gathered to thy people, as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered to his peo- ple:
<br>Because you trespassed against me in the midst of the children of Israel, at the waters of contradiction, in Cades of the desert of Sin: and you did not sanctify me among the children of Israel.
<br>Thou shalt see the land before thee, which I will give to the children of Israel, but thou shalt not enter into it.
<br>
<br>Chapter 33
<br>This is the blessing, wherewith the man of God, Moses, blessed the children of Israel, before his death.
<br>And he said: The Lord came from Sinai, and from Seir he rose up to us: he hath appeared from mount Pharan, and with him thousands of saints. In his right hand a fiery law.
<br>He hath loved the people, all the saints are in his hand: and they that approach to his feet,
<br> 
<br>shall receive of his doctrine.
<br>Moses commanded us a law, the inheritance of the multitude of Jacob.
<br>He shall be king with the most right, the princes of the people, being assembled with the tribes of Israel.
<br>Let Ruben live, and not die, and be he small in number.
<br>This is the blessing of Juda. Hear, O Lord, the voice of Juda, and bring him in unto his peo- ple: his hands shall fight for him, and he shall be his helper against his enemies.
<br>To Levi also he said: Thy perfection, and thy doctrine be to thy holy man, whom thou hast proved in the temptation, and judged at the waters of contradiction:
<br>Who hath said to his father, and to his mother: I do not know you; and to his bretheren: I know you not: and their own children they have not known. These have kept thy word, and ob- served thy covenant,
<br>Thy judgments, O Jacob, and thy law, O Israel: they shall put incense in thy wrath and holocaust upon thy altar.
<br>Bless, O Lord, his strength, and receive the works of his hands. Strike the backs of his enemies, and let not them that hate him rise.
<br>And to Benjamin he said: The best beloved of the Lord shall dwell confidently in him: as in a bride chamber shall he abide all the day long, and between his shoulders shall be rest.
<br>To Joseph also he said: Of the blessing of the Lord be his land, of the fruits of heaven, and of the dew, and of the deep that lieth beneath.
<br>Of the fruits brought forth by the sun and by the moon.
<br>Of the tops of the ancient mountains, of the fruits of the everlasting hills:
<br>And of the fruits of the earth, and of the fulness thereof. The blessing of him that
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>appeared in the bush, come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the crown of the Nazarite among his brethren.
<br>His beauty as of the firstling of a bullock, his horns as the horns of a rhinoceros: with them shall he push the nations even to the ends of the earth. These are the multitudes of Ephraim and these the thousands of Manasses.
<br>And to Zabulon he said: Rejoice, O Zabu- lon, in thy going out; and Issachar in thy taber- nacles.
<br>They shall call the people to the mountain: there shall they sacrifice the victims of justice. Who shall suck as milk the abundance of the sea, and the hidden treasures of the sands.
<br>And to Gad he said: Blessed be Gad in his breadth: he hath rested as a lion, and hath seized upon the arm and the top of the head.
<br>And he saw his pre-eminence, that in his portion the teacher was laid up: who was with the princes of the people, and did the justices of the Lord, and his judgment with Israel.
<br>To Dan also he said: Dan is a young lion, he shall flow plentifully from Basan.
<br>And To Nephtali he said: Nephtali shall enjoy abundance, and shall be full of the bless- ings of the Lord: he shall possess the sea and the south.
<br>To Aser also he said: Let Aser be blessed with children, let him be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil.
<br>His shoe shall be iron and brass. As the days of thy youth, so also shall thy old age be.
<br>There is no other god like the God of the rightest: he that is mounted upon the heaven is thy helper. By his magnificence the clouds run hither and thither.
<br>His dwelling is above, and underneath are the everlasting arms: he shall cast out the enemy from before thee, and shall say: Be thou brought
<br> 
<br>to nought.
<br>Israel shall dwell in safety, and alone. The eye of Jacob in a land of corn and wine, and the heavens shall be misty with dew.
<br>Blessed art thou, Israel: who is like to thee, O people, that art saved by the Lord? the shield of thy help, and the sword of thy glory: thy ene- mies shall deny thee, and thou shalt tread upon their necks.
<br>
<br>Chapter 34
<br>Then Moses went up from the plains of Moab upon mount Nebo, to the top of Phasga over against Jericho: and the Lord shewed him all the land of Galaad as far as Dan.
<br>And all Nephtali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasses, and all the land of Juda unto the furthermost sea,
<br>And the south part, and the breadth of the plain of Jericho the city of palm trees as far as Segor.
<br>And the Lord said to him: This is the land, for which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying: I will give it to thy seed. Thou hast seen it with thy eyes, and shalt not pass over to it.
<br>And Moses the servant of the Lord died there, in the land of Moab, by the command- ment of the Lord:
<br>And he buried him in the valley of the land of Moab over against Phogor: and no man hath known of his sepulchre until this present day.
<br>Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, neither were his teeth moved.
<br>And the children of Israel mourned for him in the plains of Moab thirty days: and the days of their mourning in which they mourned Moses were ended.
<br> 
<br>
<br>And Josue the son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom, because Moses had laid his hands upon him. And the children of Is- rael obeyed him, and did as the Lord comanded Moses.
<br>And there arose no more a prophet in Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face,
<br>In all the signs and wonders, which he sent by him, to do in the land of Egypt to Pharao, and to all his servants, and to his whole land,
<br>And all the mighty hand, and great mira- cles, which Moses did before all Israel.

<br>Book of Josue
<br>
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>Now it came to pass after the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord, that the Lord spoke to Josue, the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, and said to him:
<br>Moses my servant is dead: arise, and pass over this Jordan, thou and thy people with thee, into the land which I will give to the children of Israel.
<br>I will deliver to you every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, as I have said to Moses.
<br>From the desert, and from Libanus unto the great river Euphrates, all the land of the Het- hites, unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your border.
<br>No man shall be able to resist you all the days of thy life: as I have been with Moses, so will I be with thee: I will not leave thee, nor forsake thee.
<br>Take courage, and be strong: for thou shalt divide by lot to this people the land for which I swore to their fathers, that I would deliver it to them.
<br>Take courage therefore, and be very valiant: that thou mayst observe and do all the law, which Moses my servant hath commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayst understand all things which thou dost.
<br>Let not the book of this law depart from thy
<br> 
<br>
<br>mouth: but thou shalt meditate on it day and night, that thou mayst observe and do all things that are written in it: then shalt thou direct thy way, and understand it.
<br>Behold I command thee, take courage, and be strong. Fear not, and be not dismayed: be- cause the Lord thy God is with thee in all things whatsoever thou shalt go to.
<br>And Josue commanded the princes of the people, saying: Pass through the midst of the camp, and command the people, and say:
<br>Prepare your victuals: for after the third day you shall pass over the Jordan, and shall go in to possess the land, which the Lord your God will give you.
<br>And he said to the Rubenites, and the Ga- dites, and the half tribe of Manasses:
<br>Remember the word, which Moses the ser- vant of the Lord commanded you, saying: The Lord your God hath given you rest, and all this land.
<br>Your wives, and children; and cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan: but pass you over armed be- fore your brethren all of you that are strong of hand, and fight for them,
<br>Until the Lord give rest to your brethren, as he hath given you, and they also possess the land which the Lord your God will give them: and so you shall return into the land of your possession, and you shall dwell in it, which Moses the servant of the Lord gave you beyond the Jordan, toward
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>the rising of the sun.
<br>And they made answer to Josue, and said: All that thou hast commanded us, we will do: and whither soever thou shalt send us, we will go.
<br>As we obeyed Moses in all things, so will we obey thee also: only be the Lord thy God with thee, as he was with Moses.
<br>He that shall gainsay thy mouth, and not obey all thy words, that thou shalt command him, let him die: only take thou courage, and do manfully.
<br>
<br>Chapter 2
<br>And Josue, the son of Nun, sent from Setim two men, to spy secretly: and said to them: Go, and view the land, and the city of Jericho. They went, and entered into the house of a woman that was a harlot, named Rahab, and lodged with her. 2 And it was told the king of Jericho, and was said: Behold there are men come in hither, by
<br>night, of the children of Israel, to spy the land.
<br>And the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, say- ing: Bring forth the men that came to thee, and are entered into thy house: for they are spies, and are come to view all the land.
<br>And the woman taking the men, hid them, and said: I confess they came to me, but I knew not whence they were:
<br>And at the time of shutting the gate in the dark, they also went out together.   I know not whither they are gone: pursue after them quickly, and you will overtake them.
<br>But she made the men go up to the top of her house, and covered them with the stalks of flax, which was there.
<br>Now they that were sent, pursued after them, by the way that leadeth to the fords of
<br> 
<br>the Jordan: and as soon as they were gone out, the gate was presently shut.
<br>The men that were hid were not yet asleep, when behold the woman went up to them, and said:
<br>I know that the Lord hath given this land to you: for the dread of you is fallen upon us, and all the inhabitants of the land have lost all strength.
<br>We have heard that the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea, at your going in, when you came out of Egypt: and what things you did to the two kings of the Amorrhites, that were beyond the Jordan, Sehon and Og whom you slew.
<br>And at the hearing these things, we were affrighted, and our heart fainted away, neither did there remain any spirit in us, at your coming in: for the Lord your God he is God in heaven above, and in the earth beneath.
<br>Now, therefore, swear ye to me by the Lord, that as I have shewed mercy to you, so you also will shew mercy to my father’s house: and give me a true token.
<br>That you will save my father and mother, my brethren and sisters, and all things that are theirs, and deliver our souls from death.
<br>They answered her: Be our lives for you unto death, only if thou betray us not. And when the Lord shall have delivered us the land, we will shew thee mercy and truth.
<br>Then she let them down with a cord out of a window: for her house joined close to the wall. 16 And she said to them: Get ye up to the mountains, lest perhaps they meet you as they return: and there lie ye hid three days, till they
<br>come back, and so you shall go on yonr way.
<br>And they said to her: We shall be blameless of this oath, which thou hast made us swear,
<br>If, when we come into the land, this scar-
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>let cord be a sign, and thou tie it in the window, by which thou hast let us down: and gather to- gether thy father and mother, and brethren, and all thy kindred into thy house.
<br>Whosoever shall go out of the door of thy house, his blood shall be upon his own head, and we shall be quit. But the blood of all that shall be with thee in the house, shall light upon our head, if any man touch them.
<br>But if thou wilt betray us, and utter this word abroad, we shall be quit of this oath, which thou hast made us swear.
<br>And she answered: As you have spoken, so be it done: and sending them on their way, she hung the scarlet cord in the window.
<br>But they went and came to the mountains, and stayed there three days, till they that pur- sued them were returned.	For having sought them through all the way, they found them not. 23 And when they were gone back into the city, the spies returned, and came down from the mountain: and passing over the Jordan, they came to Josue, the son of Nun, and told him all
<br>that befel them,
<br>24 And said: the Lord hath delivered all this land into our hands, and all the inhabitants thereof are overthrown with fear.
<br>
<br>Chapter 3
<br>And Josue rose before daylight, and removed the camp: and they departed from Setim, and came to the Jordan: he, and all the children of Israel, and they abode there for three days.
<br>After which, the heralds went through the midst of the camp,
<br>And began to proclaim: When you shall see the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God, and the priests of the race of Levi carrying it, rise
<br> 
<br>you up also, and follow them as they go before: 4 And let there be between you and the ark the space of two thousand cubits: that you may see it afar off, and know which way you must go: for you have not gone this way before: and take
<br>care you come not near the ark.
<br>And Josue said to the people: Be ye sanc- tified: for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among you.
<br>And he said to the priests: Take up the ark of the covenant, and go before the people. And they obeyed his commands, and took it up, and walked before them.
<br>And the Lord said to Josue: This day will I begin to exalt thee before Israel: that they may know that as I was with Moses, so I am with thee also.
<br>And do thou command the priests, that carry the ark of the covenant, and say to them: When you shall have entered into part of the wa- ter of the Jordan, stand in it.
<br>And Josue said to the children of Israel: Come hither, and hear the word of the Lord your God.
<br>And again he said: By this you shall know, that the Lord, the living God, is in the midst of you, and that he shall destroy, before your sight, the Chanaanite and the Hethite, the Hevite and the Pherezite, the Gergesite also, and the Je- busite, and the Amorrhite.
<br>Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth shall go before you into the Jor- dan.
<br>Prepare ye twelve men of the tribes of Is- rael, one of every tribe.
<br>And when the priests, that carry the ark of the Lord the God of the whole earth, shall set the soles of their feet in the waters of the Jordan, the waters that are beneath shall run down and go off: and those that come from above,  shall
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>stand together upon a heap.
<br>So the people went out of their tents, to pass over the Jordan: and the priests that car- ried the ark of the covenant, went on before them.
<br>And as soon as they came into the Jordan, and their feet were dipped in part of the water, (now the Jordan, it being harvest time, had filled the banks of its channel,)
<br>The waters that came down from above stood in one place, and swelling up like a moun- tain, were seen afar off, from the city that is called Adom, to the place of Sarthan: but those that were beneath, ran down into the sea of the wilderness, (which now is called the Dead Sea) until they wholly failed.
<br>And the people marched over against Jeri- cho: and the priests that carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord, stood girded upon the dry ground in the midst of the Jordan, and all the people passed over, through the channel that was dried up.
<br>
<br>Chapter 4
<br>And when they were passed over, the Lord said to Josue:
<br>Choose twelve men, one of every tribe:
<br>And command them to take out of the midst of the Jordan, where the feet of the priests stood, twelve very hard stones, which you shall set in the place of the camp, where you shall pitch your tents this night.
<br>And Josue called twelve men, whom he had chosen out of the children of Israel, one out of every tribe,
<br>And he said to them: Go before the ark of the Lord your God to the midst of the Jordan, and carry from thence every man a stone on your
<br> 
<br>shoulders, according to the number of the chil- dren of Israel,
<br>That it may be a sign among you: and when your children shall ask you tomorrow, saying: What means these stones?
<br>You shall answer them: The waters of the Jordan ran off before the ark of the covenant of the Lord when it passed over the same: there- fore were these stones set for a monument of the children of Israel forever.
<br>The children of Israel therefore did as Jo- sue commanded them, carrying out of the chan- nel of the Jordan twelve stones, as the Lord had commanded him according to the number of the children of Israel unto the place wherein they camped, and there they set them.
<br>And Josue put other twelve stones in the midst of the channel of the   Jordan,   where the priests stood that carried the ark of the covenant: and they are there until this present day.
<br>Now the priests that carried the ark, stood in the midst of the Jordan, till all things were accomplished, which the Lord had commanded Josue to speak to the people, and Moses had said to him. And the people made haste, and passed over.
<br>And when they had all passed over, the ark also of the Lord passed over, and the priests went before the people.
<br>The children of Ruben also, and Gad, and half the tribe of Manasses, went armed before the children of Israel, as Moses had commanded them.
<br>And forty thousand fighting men by their troops and bands, marched through the plains and fields of the city of Jericho.
<br>In that day the Lord magnified Josue in the sight of all Israel, that they should fear him, as they had feared Moses, while he lived.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>And he said to him:
<br>Command the priests,  that carry the ark of the covenant, to come up out of the Jordan.
<br>And he commanded them, saying: Come ye up out of the Jordan.
<br>And when they that carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord, were come up, and began to tread on the dry ground, the waters returned into their channel, and ran as they were wont before.
<br>And the people came up out of the Jordan, the tenth day of the first month, and camped in Galgal, over against the east side of the city of Jericho.
<br>And the twelve stones, which they had taken out of the channel of the Jordan, Josue pitched in Galgal,
<br>And said to the children of Israel: When your children shall ask their fathers tomorrow, and shall say to them: What mean these stones?
<br>You shall teach them, and say: Israel passed over this Jordan through the dry chan- nel,
<br>The Lord your God drying up the waters thereof in your sight, until you passed over:
<br>As he had done before in the Red Sea, which he dried up till we passed through:
<br>That all the people of the earth may learn the most mighty hand of the Lord, that you also may fear the Lord your God for ever.
<br>
<br>Chapter 5
<br>Now when all the kings of the Amorrhites, who dwelt beyond the Jordan, westward, and all the kings of Chanaan, who possessed the places near the great sea, had heard that the Lord had dried up the waters of the Jordan before the children of Israel, till they passed over, their heart failed
<br> 
<br>them, and there remained no spirit in them, fear- ing the coming in of the children of Israel.
<br>At that time the Lord said to Josue: Make thee knives of stone, and circumcise the second time the children of Israel.
<br>He did what the Lord had commanded, and he circumcised the children of Israel in the hill of the foreskins.
<br>Now this is the cause of the second circumci- sion: All the people that came out of Egypt that were males, all the men fit for war, died in the desert, during the time of the long going about in the way:
<br>6 Now these were all circumcised. But the people that were born in the desert,
<br>During the forty years of the journey in the wide wilderness, were uncircumcised: till all they were consumed that had not heard the voice of the Lord, and to whom he had sworn before, that he would not shew them the land flowing with milk and honey.
<br>The children of these succeeded in the place of their fathers, and were circumcised by Josue: for they were uncircumcised even as they were born, and no one had circumcised them in the way.
<br>Now after they were all circumcised, they remained in the same place of the camp, until they were healed.
<br>And the Lord said to Josue: This day have I taken away from you the reproach of Egypt. And the name of that place was called Galgal, until this present day.
<br>And the children of Israel abode in Galgal, and they kept the phase, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, in the plains of Jericho: 11 And they ate on the next day unleavened bread of the corn of the land, and frumenty of
<br>the same year.
<br>12 And the manna ceased after they ate of the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>corn of the land, neither did the children of Israel use that food any more, but they ate of the corn of the present year of the land of Chanaan.
<br>13	And when Josue was in the field of the city of Jericho, he lifted up his eyes, and saw a man standing over against him, holding a drawn sword, and he went to him, and said: Art thou one of ours, or of our adversaries?
<br>14	And he answered: No: but I am prince of the host of the Lord, and now I am come.
<br>15	Josue fell on his face to the ground. And worshipping, said: What saith my lord to his servant?
<br>16	Loose, saith he, thy shoes from off thy feet: for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And Josue did as was commanded him.
<br>
<br>Chapter 6
<br>Now Jericho was close shut up and fenced, for fear of the children of Israel, and no man durst go out or come in.
<br>And the Lord said to Josue: Behold I have given into thy hands Jericho, and the king thereof, and all the valiant men.
<br>Go round about the city all ye fighting men once a day: so shall ye do for six days.
<br>And on the seventh day the priests shall take the seven trumpets, which are used in the ju- bilee, and shall go before the ark of the covenant: and you shall go about the city seven times, and the priests shall sound the trumpets.
<br>And when the voice of the trumpet shall give a longer and broken tune, and shall sound iu your ears, all the people shall shout together with a very great shout, and the walls of the city shall fall to the ground, and they shall enter in every one at the place against which they shall stand.
<br> 
<br>Then Josue, the son of Nun, called the priests, and said to them: Take the ark of the covenant: and let seven other priests take the seven trumpets of the jubilee, and march before the ark of the Lord.
<br>And he said to the people: Go, and compass the city, armed, marching before the ark of the Lord.
<br>And when Josue had ended his words, and the seven priests blew the seven trumpets before the ark of the covenant of the Lord,
<br>And all the armed men went before, the rest of the common people followed the ark, and the sound of the trumpets was heard on all sides.
<br>But Josue had commanded the people, say- ing: You shall not shout, nor shall your voice be heard, nor any word go out of your mouth: until the day come wherein I shall say to you: Cry, and shout.
<br>So the ark of the Lord went about the city once a day, and returning into the camp, abode there.
<br>And Josue rising before day, the priests took the ark of the Lord,
<br>And seven of them seven trumpets, which are used in the jubilee: and they went before the ark of the Lord, walking and sounding the trumpets: and the armed men went before them, and the rest of the common people followed the ark, and they blew the trumpets.
<br>And they went round about the city the second day once, and returned into the camp. So they did six days.
<br>But the seventh day, rising up early, they went about the city, as it was ordered, seven times.
<br>And when in the seventh going about the priests sounded with the trumpets, Josue said to all Israel: Shout: for the Lord hath delivered the city to you:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>And let this city be an anathema, and all things that are in it, to the Lord. Let only Ra- hab, the harlot, live, with all that are with her in the house: for she hid the messengers whom we sent.
<br>But beware ye lest you touch ought of those things that are forbidden, and you be guilty of transgression, and all the camp of Israel be under sin, and be troubled.
<br>But whatsoever gold or silver there shall be, or vessels of brass and iron, let it be conse- crated to the Lord, laid up in his treasures.
<br>So all the people making a shout, and the trumpets sounding, when the voice and the sound thundered in the ears of the multitude, the walls forthwith fell down: and every man went up by the place that was over against him: and they took the city,
<br>And killed all that were in it, man and woman, young and old. The oxen also, and the sheep, and the asses, they slew with the edge of the sword.
<br>But Josue said to the two men that had been sent for spies: Go into the harlot’s house, and bring her out, and all things that are hers, as you assured her by oath.
<br>And the young men went in, and brought out Rahab, and her parents, her brethren also, and all her goods, and her kindred, and made them to stay without the camp.
<br>But they burned the city, and all things that were therein; except the gold and silver, and vessels of brass and iron, which they consecrated unto the treasury of the Lord.
<br>But Josue saved Rahab the harlot, and her father’s house, and all she had, and they dwelt in the midst of Israel until this present day: be- cause she hid the messengers whom he had sent to spy out Jericho. At that time, Josue made an imprecation, saying:
<br> 
<br>Cursed be the man before the Lord, that shall raise up and build the city of Jericho. In his firstborn may he lay the foundation thereof, and in the last of his children set up its gates.
<br>And the Lord was with Josue, and his name was noised throughout all the land
<br>
<br>Chapter 7
<br>But the children of Israel transgressed the com- mandment, and took to their own use of that which was accursed. For Achan, the son of Charmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zare, of the tribe of Juda, took something of the anathema: and the Lord was angry against the children of Israel.
<br>And when Josue sent men from Jericho against Hai, which is beside Bethaven, on the east side of the town of Bethel, he said to them: Go up, and view the country: and they fulfilled his command, and viewed Hai.
<br>And returning, they said to him: Let not all the people go up, but let two or three thousand men go, and destroy the city: why should all the people be troubled in vain, against enemies that are very few?
<br>There went up therefore three thousand fighting men: who immediately turned their backs,
<br>And were defeated by the men of the city of Hai, and there fell of them six and thirty men: and the enemies pursued them from the gate as far as Sabarim, and they slew them as they fled by the descent: and the heart of the people was struck with fear, and melted like water.
<br>But Josue rent his garments, and fell flat on the ground, before the ark of the Lord, until the evening, both he and all the ancients of Israel: and they put dust upon their heads.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>And Josue said: Alas, O Lord God, why wouldst thou bring this people over the river Jor- dan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorrhite, and to destroy us? would God we had stayed be- yond the Jordan, as we began.
<br>My Lord God, what shall I say, seeing Israel turning their backs to their enemies?
<br>The Chanaanites, and all the inhabitants of the land, will hear of it, and being gathered together will surround us, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do to thy great name?
<br>And the Lord said to Josue: Arise, why liest thou flat on the ground?
<br>Israel hath sinned, and transgressed my covenant: and they have taken of the anathema, and have stolen and lied, and have hid it among their goods.
<br>Neither can Israel stand before his enemies, but he shall flee from them: because he is defiled with the anathema. I will be no more with you, till you destroy him that is guilty of this wicked- ness.
<br>Arise, sanctify the people, and say to them: Be ye sanctified against tomorrow: for thus saith the Lord God of Israel: The curse is in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thy enemies, till he be destroyed out of thee, that is defiled with this wickedness.
<br>And you shall come in the morning, every one by your tribes: and what tribe soever the lot shall find, it shall come by its kindreds, and the kindred by its houses and tho house by the men. 15 And whosoever he be that shall be found guilty of this fact, he shall be burnt with fire, with all his substance, because he hath trans- gressed the covenant of the Lord, and hath done
<br>wickedness in Israel.
<br>16 Josue, therefore, when he rose in the morn- ing, made Israel to come by their tribes, and the
<br> 
<br>tribe of Juda was found.
<br>Which being brought by in families, it was found to be the family of Zare. Bringing that also by the houses, he found it to be Zabdi:
<br>And bringing his house man by man, he found Achan, the son of Charmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zare, of the tribe of Juda.
<br>And Josue said to Achan: My son, give glory to the Lord God of Israel, and confess, and tell me what thou hast done, hide it not.
<br>And Achan answered Josue, and said to him: Indeed I have sinned against the Lord, the God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done.
<br>For I saw among the spoils a scarlet gar- ment, exceeding good, and two hundred sicles of silver, and a golden rule of fifty sicles: and I cov- eted them, and I took them away, and hid them in the ground in the midst of my tent, and the silver I covered with the earth that I dug up.
<br>Josue therefore sent ministers: who run- ning to his tent, found all hid in the same place, together with the silver.
<br>And taking them away out of the tent, they brought them to Josue, and to all the children of Israel, and threw them down before the Lord. 24 Then Josue, and all Israel with him, took Achan, the son of Zare, and the silver, and the garment, and the golden rule, his sons also, and his daughters, his oxen, and asses, and sheep, the tent also, and all the goods: and brought them
<br>to the valley of Achor:
<br>Where Josue said: Because thou hast trou- bled us, the Lord trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him: and all things that were his, were consumed with fire.
<br>And they gathered together upon him a great heap of stones, which remaineth until this present day And the wrath of the Lord was turned away from them. And the name of that place was called the Valley of Achor, until this
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>day.
<br>
<br>Chapter 8
<br>And the Lord said to Josue: Fear not, nor be thou dismayed: take with thee all the multitude of fighting men, arise, and go up to the town of Hai: Behold I have delivered into thy hand the king thereof, and the people, and the city, and the land.
<br>And thou shalt do to the city of Hai, and to the king thereof, as thou hast done to Jericho, and to the king thereof: but the spoils, and all the cattle, you shall take for a prey to yourselves: lay an ambush for the city behind it.
<br>And Josue arose, and all the army of the fighting men with him, to go up against Hai: and he sent thirty thousand chosen valiant men in the night,
<br>And commanded them, saying: Lay an am- bush behind the city: and go not very far from it: and be ye all ready.
<br>But I, and the rest of the multitude which is with me, will approach on the contrary side against the city. And when they shall come out against us, we will flee, and turn our backs, as we did before:
<br>Till they pursuing us be drawn farther from the city: for they will think that we flee as before. 7 And whilst we are fleeing, and they pursu- ing, you shall rise out of the ambush, and shall destroy the city: and the Lord your God will
<br>deliver it into your hands.
<br>And when you shall have taken it, set it on fire, and you shall do all things so as I have commanded.
<br>And he sent them away, and they went on to the place of the ambush, and abode between Bethel and Hai, on the west side of the city of
<br> 
<br>Hai. But Josue staid that night in the midst of the people,
<br>And rising early in the morning, he mus- tered his soldiers, and went up with the ancients in the front of the army, environed with the aid of the fighting men.
<br>And when they were come, and were gone up over against the city, they stood on the north side of the city, between which and them there was a valley in the midst.
<br>And he had chosen five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush between Bethel and Hai, on the west side of the same city:
<br>But all the rest of the army went in battle array on the north side, so that the last of that multitude reached to the west side of the city. So Josue went that night, and stood in the midst of the valley.
<br>And when the king of Hai saw this, he made haste in the morning, and went out with all the army of the city, and set it in battle array, toward the desert, not knowing that there lay an ambush behind his back.
<br>But Josue, and all Israel gave back, making as if they were afraid, and fleeing by the way of the wilderness.
<br>But they shouting together, and encourag- ing one another, pursued them. And when they were come from the city,
<br>And not one remained in the city of Hai and of Bethel, that did not pursue after Israel, leaving the towns open as they had rushed out, 18 The Lord said to Josue: Lift up the shield that is in thy hand, towards the city of Hai, for
<br>I will deliver it to thee.
<br>And when he had lifted up his shield to- wards the city, the ambush, that lay hid, rose up immediately: and going to the city, took it, and set it on fire.
<br>And the men of the city, that pursued after
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Josue, looking back, and seeing the smoke of the city rise up to heaven, had no more power to flee this way or that way: especially as they that had counterfeited flight, and were going toward the wilderness, turned back most valiantly against them that pursued.
<br>So Josue, and all Israel, seeing that the city was taken, and that the smoke of the city rose up, returned, and slew the men of Hai.
<br>And they also that had taken and set the city on fire, issuing out of the city to meet their own men, began to cut off the enemies who were surrounded by them.   So that the enemies be- ing cut off on both sides, not one of so great a multitude was saved.
<br>And they took the king of the city of Hai alive and brought him to Josue.
<br>So all being slain that had pursued after Israel, in his flight to the wilderness, and falling by the sword in the same place, the children of Israel returned and laid waste the city.
<br>And the number of them that fell that day, both of men and women, was twelve thousand persons, all of the city of Hai.
<br>But Josue drew not back his hand, which he had stretched out on high, holding the shield, till all the inhabitants of Hai were slain.
<br>And the children of Israel divided among them, the cattle and the prey of the city, as the Lord had commanded Josue.
<br>And he burnt the city, and made it a heap forever:
<br>And he hung the king thereof on a gibbet, until the evening and the going down of the sun. Then Josue commanded, and they took down his carcass from the gibbet: and threw it in the very entrance of the city, heaping upon it a great heap of stones, which remaineth until this present day. 30 Then Josue built an altar to the Lord, the
<br>God of Israel, in Mount Hebal,
<br> 
<br>As Moses, the servant of the Lord, had commanded the children of Israel, and it is writ- ten in the book of the law of Moses: an altar of unhewn stones, which iron had not touched: and he offered upon it holocausts to the Lord, and immolated victims of peace offerings.
<br>And he wrote upon stones, the Deuteron- omy of the law of Moses, which he had ordered before the children of Israel.
<br>And all the people, and the ancients, and the princes, and judges, stood on both sides of the ark, before the priests that carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord, both the stranger and he that was born among them, half of them by Mount Garizim, and half by Mount Hebal, as Moses the servant of the Lord, had commanded. And first he blessed the people of Israel.
<br>After this, he read all the words of the blessing and the cursing, and all things that were written in the book of the law.
<br>He left out nothing of those things which Moses had commanded, but he repeated all be- fore all the people of Israel, with the women and children, and strangers, that dwelt among them.
<br>
<br>Chapter 9
<br>Now when these things were heard of, all the kings beyond the Jordan, that dwelt in the mountains, and in the plains, in the places near the sea, and on the coasts of the great sea, they also that dwell by Libanus, the Hethite, and the Amorrhite, the Chanaanite, the Pherezite, and the Hevite, and the Jebusite,
<br>Gathered themselves together, to fight against Josue and Israel with one mind, and one resolution.
<br>But they that dwelt in Gabaon, hearing all that Josue had done to Jericho and Hai:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Cunningly devising took for themselves pro- visions, laying old sacks upon their asses, and wine bottles rent and sewed up again,
<br>And very old shoes, which for a show of age were clouted with patches, and old garments upon them: the loaves also, which they carried for provisions by the way, were hard, and broken into pieces:
<br>And they went to Josue, who then abode in the camp at Galgal, and said to him, and to all Israel with him: We are come from a far coun- try, desiring to make peace with you. And the children of Israel answered them, and said:
<br>Perhaps you dwell in the land which falls to our lot; if so, we can make no league with you.
<br>But they said to Josue: We are thy servants. Josue said to them: Who are you? and whence came you?
<br>They answered: From a very far country thy servants are come in the name of the Lord thy God. For we have heard the fame of his power, all the things that he did in Egypt.
<br>And to the two kings of the Amorrhites, that were beyond the Jordan, Sehon, king of Hesebon, and Og, king of Basan, that was in Astaroth:
<br>And our ancients, and all the inhabitants of our country, said to us: Take with you victuals for a long way, and go meet them, and say: We are your servants, make ye a league with us.
<br>Behold, these loaves we took hot, when we set out from our houses to come to you, now they are become dry, and broken in pieces by being exceeding old.
<br>These bottles of wine when we filled them were new, now they are rent and burst. These garments we have on, and the shoes we have on our feet, by reason of the very long journey, are worn out, and almost consumed.
<br>They took therefore of their victuals, and
<br> 
<br>consulted not the mouth of the Lord.
<br>And Josue made peace with them, and en- tering into a league, promised that they should not be slain: the princes also of the multitude swore to them.
<br>Now three days after the league was made, they heard that they dwelt nigh, and they should be among them.
<br>And the children of Israel removed the camp, and came into their cities on the third day, the names of which are, Gabaon, and Caphira, and Beroth, and Cariathiarim.
<br>And they slew them not, because the princes of the multitude had sworn in the name of the Lord, the God of Israel. Then all the com- mon people murmured against the princes.
<br>And they answered them: We have sworn to them in the name of the Lord, the God of Israel, and therefore we may not touch them.
<br>But this we will do to them: Let their lives be saved, lest the wrath of the Lord be stirred up against us, if we should be forsworn:
<br>But so let them live, as to serve the whole multitude in hewing wood, and bringing in wa- ter. As they were speaking these things,
<br>Therefore you shall be under a curse, and your race shall always be hewers of wood, and carriers of water, into the house of my God.
<br>They answered: It was told us, thy ser- vants, that the Lord thy God had promised his servant Moses, to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants thereof. Therefore we feared exceedingly and provided for our lives, compelled by the dread we had of you, and we took this counsel.
<br>And now we are in thy hand: deal with us as it seemeth good and right unto thee.
<br>So Josue did as he had said, and delivered them from the hand of the children of Israel, that they should not be slain.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>And he gave orders in that day, that they should be in the service of all the people, and of the altar of the Lord, hewing wood, and carrying water, until this present time, in the place which the Lord hath chosen.
<br>
<br>Chapter 10
<br>When Adonisedec, king of Jerusalem, had heard these things, to wit, that Josue had taken Hai, and had destroyed it, (for as he had done to Jeri- cho and the king thereof, so did he to Hai and its king) and that the Gabaonites were gone over to Israel, and were their confederates,
<br>He was exceedingly afraid. For Gabaon was a great city, and one of the royal cities, and greater than the town of Hai, and all its fighting men were most valiant.
<br>Therefore Adonisedec, king of Jerusalem, sent to Oham, king of Hebron, and to Pharam, king of Jerimoth, and to Japhia, king of Lachis, and to Dabir, king of Eglon, saying:
<br>Come up to me, and bring help, that we may take Gabaon, because it hath gone over to Josue, and to the children of Israel.
<br>So the five kings of the Amorrhites be- ing assembled together, went up: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jeri- moth, the king of Lachis, the king of Eglon, they and their armies, and camped about Gabaon, laying siege to it.
<br>But the inhabitants of the city of Gabaon, which was besieged, sent to Josue, who then abode in the camp at Galgal, and said to him: Withdraw not thy hands from helping thy ser- vants: come up quickly, and save us, and bring us succour: for all the kings of the Amorrhites, who dwell in the mountains, are gathered together against us.
<br> 
<br>And Josue went up from Galgal, and all the army of the warriors with him, most valiant men. 8 But the Lord said to Josue: Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thy hands: none
<br>of them shall be able to stand against thee.
<br>So Josue going up from Galgal all the night, came upon them suddenly.
<br>And the Lord troubled them, at the sight of Israel: and he slew them with a great slaughter, in Gabaon, and pursued them by the way of the ascent to Bethoron, and cut them off all the way to Azeca and Maceda.
<br>And when they were fleeing from the children of Israel, and were in the descent of Bethoron, the Lord cast down upon them great stones from heaven, as far as Azeca: and many more were killed with the hailstones, than were slain by the swords of the children of Israel,
<br>Then Josue spoke to the Lord, in the day that he delivered the Amorrhite in the sight of the children of Israel, and he said before them: Move not, O sun, toward Gabaon, nor thou, O moon, toward the valley of Ajalon.
<br>And the sun and the moon stood still, till the people revenged themselves of their enemies. Is not this written in the book of the just? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down the space of one day.
<br>There was not before, nor after, so long a day, the Lord obeying the voice of a man, and fighting for Israel.
<br>And Josue returned, with all Israel, into the camp of Galgal.
<br>For the five kings were fled, and had hid themselves in a cave of the city of Maceda.
<br>And it was told Josue, that the five kings were found hid in a cave of the city of Maceda.
<br>And he commanded them that were with him, saying: Roll great stones to the mouth of the cave, and set careful men to keep them shut
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>up:
<br>And stay you not, but pursue after the ene- mies, and kill all the hindermost of them as they flee, and do not suffer them whom the Lord God hath delivered into your hands, to shelter them- selves in their cities.
<br>So the enemies being slain with a great slaughter, and almost utterly consumed, they that were able to escape from Israel, entered into fenced cities.
<br>And all the army returned to Josue, in Maceda, where the camp then was, in good health, and without the loss of any one: and no man durst move his tongue against the children of Israel.
<br>And Josue gave orders, saying: Open the mouth of the cave, and bring forth to me the five kings that lie hid therein.
<br>And the ministers did as they were com- manded: and they brought out to him the five kings out of the cave: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jerimoth, the king of Lachis, the king of Eglon.
<br>And when they were brought out to him, he called all the men of Israel, and said to the chiefs of the army that were with him: Go, and set your feet on the necks of these kings. And when they had gone, and put their feet upon the necks of them lying under them,
<br>He said again to them: Fear not, neither be ye dismayed, take courage, and be strong: for so will the Lord do to all your enemies, against whom you fight.
<br>And Josue struck, and slew them, and hanged them upon five gibbets; and they hung until the evening.
<br>And when the sun was down, he com- manded the soldiers to take them down from the gibbets. And after they were taken down, they cast them into the cave, where they had lain hid,
<br> 
<br>and put great stones at the mouth thereof, which remain until this day.
<br>The same day Josue took Maceda, and de- stroyed it with the edge of the sword, and killed the king and all the inhabitants thereof: he left not in it the least remains.   And he did to the king of Maceda, as he had done to the king of Jericho.
<br>And he passed from Maceda with all Israel to Lebna, and fought against it:
<br>And the Lord delivered it with the king thereof into the hands of Israel: and they de- stroyed the city with the edge of the sword, and all the inhabitants thereof. They left not in it any remains. And they did to the king of Lebna, as they had done to the king of Jericho.
<br>From Lebna he passed unto Lachis, with all Israel: and investing it with his army, besieged it.
<br>And the Lord delivered Lachis into the hands of Israel, and he took it the following day, and put it to the sword, and every soul that was in it, as he had done to Lebna.
<br>At that time Horam, king of Gazer, came up to succour Lachis: and Josue slew him with all his people so as to leave none alive.
<br>And he passed from Lachis to Eglon, and surrounded it,
<br>And took it the same day: and put to the sword all the souls that were in it, according to all that he had done to Lachis.
<br>He went up also with all Israel from Eglon to Hebron, and fought against it:
<br>Took it, and destroyed it with the edge of the sword: the king also thereof, and all the towns of that country, and all the souls that dwelt in it: he left not therein any remains: as he had done to Eglon, so did he also to Hebron, putting to the sword all that he found in it.
<br>Returning from thence to Dabir,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>He took it, and destroyed it: the king also thereof, and all the towns round about, he de- stroyed with the edge of the sword: he left not in it any remains: as he had done to Hebron and Lebna, and to their kings, so did he to Dabir, and to the king thereof.
<br>So Josue conquered all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the plain, and of Asedoth, with their kings: he left not any re- mains therein, but slew all that breathed, as the Lord, the God of Israel, had commanded him.
<br>From Cadesbarne even to Gaza. All the land of Gosen even to Gabaon,
<br>And all their kings, and their lands he took and wasted at one onset: for the Lord the God of Israel fought for him.
<br>And he returned with all Israel to the place of the camp in Galgal.
<br>
<br>Chapter 11
<br>And when Jabin king of Asor had heard these things, he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Semeron, and to the king of Achsaph: 2 And to the kings of the north, that dwelt in the mountains and in the plains over against the south side of Ceneroth, and in the levels and the
<br>countries of Dor by the sea side:
<br>To the Chanaanites also on the east and on the west, and the Amorrhite, and the Hethite, and the Pherezite, and the Jebusite in the moun- tains: to the Hevite also who dwelt at the foot of Hermon in the land of Maspha.
<br>And they all came out with their troops, a people exceeding numerous as the sand that is on the sea shore, their horses also and chariots a very great multitude,
<br>And all these kings assembled together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.
<br> 
<br>And the Lord said to Josue: Fear them not: for to morrow at this same hour I will deliver all these to be slain in the sight of Israel: thou shalt hamstring their horses, and thou shalt burn their chariots with fire.
<br>And Josue came, and all the army with him, against them to the waters of Merom on a sud- den, and fell upon them.
<br>And the Lord delivered them into the hands of Israel. And they defeated them, and chased them as far as the great Sidon and the waters of Maserophot, and the field of Masphe, which is on the east thereof. He slew them all, so as to leave no remains of them:
<br>And he did as the Lord had commanded him, he hamstringed their horses and burned their chariots.
<br>And presently turning back he took Asor: and slew the king thereof with the sword. Now Asor of old was the head of all these kingdoms. 11 And he cut off all the souls that abode there: he left not in it any remains, but utterly destroyed all, and burned the city itself with fire. 12 And he took and put to the sword and destroyed all the cities round about, and their kings, as Moses the servant of God had com-
<br>manded him.
<br>Except the cities that were on hills and high places, the rest Israel burned: only Asor that was very strong he consumed with fire.
<br>And the children of Israel divided among themselves all the spoil of these cities and the cattle, killing all the men.
<br>As the Lord had commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Josue, and he accomplished all: he left not one thing undone of all the commandments which the Lord had commanded Moses.
<br>So Josue took all the country of the hills, and of the south, and the land of Gosen, and the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>plains and the west country, and the mountain of Israel, and the plains thereof:
<br>And part of the mountain that goeth up to Seir as far as Baalgad, by the plain of Libanus under mount Hermon: all their kings he took, smote and slew.
<br>Josue made war a long time against these kings.
<br>There was not a city that delivered itself to the children of Israel, except the Hevite, who dwelt in Gabaon: for he took all by fight.
<br>For it was the sentence of the Lord, that their hearts should be hardened, and they should fight against Israel, and fall, and should not de- serve any clemency, and should be destroyed as the Lord had commanded Moses.
<br>At that time Josue came and cut off the Enancims from the mountains, from Hebron, and Dabir, and Anab, and from all the mountain of Juda and Israel, and destroyed their cities.
<br>He left not any of the stock of the Enacims, in the land of the children of Israel: except the cities of Gaza, and Geth, and Azotus, in which alone they were left.
<br>So Josue took all the land, as the Lord spoke to Moses, and delivered it in possession to the children of Israel, according to their divisions and tribes. And the land rested from wars.
<br>
<br>Chapter 12
<br>These are the kings, whom the children of Israel slew and possessed their land beyond the Jor- dan towards the rising of the sun, from the tor- rent Arnon unto mount Hermon, and all the east country that looketh towards the wilderness.
<br>Sehon king of the Amorrhites, who dwelt in Hesebon, and had dominion from Aroer, which is seated upon the bank of the torrent Arnon,
<br> 
<br>and of the middle part in the valley, and of half Galaad, as far as the torrent Jaboc, which is the border of the children of Ammon.
<br>And from the wilderness, to the sea of Cen- eroth towards the east, and to the sea of the wilderness, which is the most salt sea, on the east side by the way that leadeth to Bethsimoth: and on the south side that lieth under Asedoth, Phasga.
<br>The border of Og the king of Basan, of the remnant of the Raphaims who dwelt in Astaroth, and in Edrai, and had dominion in mount Her- mon, and in Salecha, and in all Basan, unto the borders
<br>Of Gessuri and Machati, and of half Galaad: the borders of Sehon the king of Hesebon.
<br>Moses the servant of the Lord, and the chil- dren of Israel slew them, and Moses delivered their land in possession to the Rubenites, and Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasses.
<br>These are the kings of the land, whom Josue and the children of Israel slew beyond the Jordan on the west side from Baalgad in the field of Libanus, unto the mount, part of which goeth up into Seir: and Josue delivered it in possession to the tribes of Israel, to every one their divisions, 8 As well in the mountains as in the plains and the champaign countries. In Asedoth, and in the wilderness, and in the south was the Het- hite and the Amorrhite, the Chanaanite and the
<br>Pherezite, the Hevite and the Jebusite.
<br>The king of Jericho one: the king of Hai, which is on the side of Bethel, one:
<br>The king of Jerusalem one, the king of He- bron one,
<br>The king of Jerimoth one, thee king of Lachis one,
<br>The king of Eglon one, the king of Gazer one,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>The king of Dabir one, the king of Gader one,
<br>The king of Herma one, the king of Hered one,
<br>The king of Lebna one, the king of Odullam one,
<br>The king of Maceda one, the king of Bethel one,
<br>The king of Taphua one, the king of Opher one,
<br>The king of Aphec one, the king of Saron one,
<br>The king of Madon one, the king of Asor one,
<br>The king of Semeron one, the king of Achsaph one,
<br>The king of Thenac one, the king of Mageddo one,
<br>Thee king of Cades one, the king of Jachanan of Carmel one,
<br>The king of Dor, and of the province of Dor one, the king of the nations of Galgal one,
<br>The king of Thersa one: all the kings thirty and one.
<br>
<br>Chapter 13
<br>
<br>Josue was old, and far advanced in years, and the Lord said to him: Thou art grown old, and advanced in age, and there is a very large country left, which is not yet divided by lot:
<br>To wit, all Galilee, Philistia, and all Gessuri.
<br>From the troubled river, that watereth Egypt, unto the border of Accaron northward: the land of Chanaan, which is divided among the lords of the Philistines, the Gazites, the Azo- tians, the Ascalonites, the Gethites, and the Ac- cronites.
<br> 
<br>And on the south side are the Hevites, all the land of Chanaan, and Maara of the Sidonians as far as Apheca, and the borders of the Amorrhite,
<br>And his confines. The country also of Libanus towards the east from Baalgad under mount Hermon to the entering into Emath.
<br>Of all that dwell in the mountains from Libanus, to the waters of Maserephoth, and all the Sidonians. I am he that will cut them off from before the face of the children of Israel. So let their land come in as a part of the inheritance of Israel, as I have commanded thee.
<br>And now divide the land in possession to the nine tribes, and to the half tribe of Manasses,
<br>With whom Ruben and Gad have possessed the land, which Moses the servant of the Lord delivered to them beyond the river Jordan, on the east side.
<br>From Aroer, which is upon the bank of the torrent Arnon, and in the midst of the valley and all the plains of Medaba, as far as Dibon:
<br>And all the cities of Sehon, king of the Amorrhites, who reigned in Hesebon, unto the borders of the children of Ammon.
<br>And Galaad, and the borders of Gessuri and Machati, and all mount Hermon, and all Basan as far as Salecha,
<br>All the kingdom of Og in Basan, who reigned in Astaroth and Edrai, he was of the remains of the Raphaims: and Moses overthrew and destroyed them.
<br>And the children of Israel would not de- stroy Gessuri and Machati and they have dwelt in the midst of Israel, until this present day.
<br>But to the tribe of Levi he gave no posses- sion: but the sacrifices and victims of thee Lord God of Israel, are his inheritance, as he spoke to him.
<br>And Moses gave a possession to the chil- dren of Ruben according to their kindreds.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>And their border was from Aroer, which is on the bank of the torrent Arnon, and in the midst of the valley of the same torrent: all the plain, that leadeth to Medaba,
<br>And Hesebon, and all their villages, which are in the plains. Dibon also, and Bamothbaal, and the town of Baalmaon,
<br>And Jassa, and Cidimoth, and Mephaath,
<br>And Cariathaim, and Sabama, and Sarathasar in the mountain of the valley.
<br>Bethphogor and Asedoth, Phasga and Bethiesimoth,
<br>And all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdoms of Sehon king of the Amorrhites, that reigned in Hesebon, whom Moses slew with the princes of Madian: Hevi, and Recem, and Sur and Hur, and Rebe, dukes of Sehon inhabitants of the land.
<br>Balaam also the son of Beor the soothsayer, the children of Israel slew with the sword among the rest that were slain.
<br>And the river Jordan was the border of the children of Ruben. This is the possession of the Rubenites, by their kindreds, of cities and villages.
<br>And Moses gave to the tribe of Gad and to his children by their kindreds a possession, of which this is the division.
<br>The border of Jaser, and all the cities of Galaad, and half the land of the children of Ammon: as far as Aroer which is over against Rabba:
<br>And from Hesebon unto Ramoth, Masphe and Betonim: and from Manaim unto the bor- ders of Dabir.
<br>And in the valley Betharan and Beth- nemra, and Socoth, and Saphon the other part of the kingdom of Sehon king of Hesebon: the limit of this also is the Jordan, as far as the ut- termost part of the sea of Cenereth beyond the
<br> 
<br>Jordan on the east side,
<br>This is the possession of the children of Gad by their families, their cities, and villages.
<br>He gave also to the half tribe of Manasses and his children possession according to their kindreds,
<br>The beginning whereof is this: from Man- aim all Basan, and all the kingdoms of Og king of Basan, and all the villages of Jair, which are in Basan, threescore towns.
<br>And half Galaad, and Astaroth, and Edrai, cities of the kingdom of Og in Basan: to the children of Machir, the son of Manasses, to one half of the children of Machir according to their kindreds.
<br>This possession Moses divided in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan, over against Jeri- cho on the east side,
<br>But to the tribe of Levi he gave no posses- sion: because the Lord the God of Israel himself is their possession, as he spoke to them.
<br>
<br>Chapter 14
<br>This is what the children of Israel possessed in the land of Chanaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Josue the son of Nun, and the princes of the families by the tribes of Israel gave to them.
<br>Dividing all by lot, as the Lord had com- manded the hand of Moses, to the nine tribes, and the half tribe.
<br>For to two tribes and a half Moses had given possession beyond the Jordan: besides the Levites, who received no land among their brethren:
<br>But in their place succeeded the children of Joseph divided into two tribes, of Manasses and Ephraim: neither did the Levites receive other portion of land, but cities to dwell in, and their
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>suburbs to feed their beasts and flocks.
<br>As the Lord had commanded Moses so did the children of Israel, and they divided the land. 6 Then the children of Juda came to Josue in Galgal, and Caleb the son of Jephone the Cenezite spoke to him: Thou knowest what the Lord spoke to Moses the man of God concerning
<br>me and thee in Cadesbarne.
<br>I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Cadesbarne, to view the land, and I brought him word again as to me seemed true,
<br>But my brethren, that had gone up with me, discouraged the heart of the people: and I nevertheless followed the Lord my God.
<br>And Moses swore in that day, saying: The land which thy foot hath trodden upon shall be thy possession, and thy children for ever, because thou hast followed the Lord my God.
<br>The Lord therefore hath granted me life, as he promised until this present day, It is forty and five years since the Lord spoke this word to Moses, when Israel journeyed through the wilderness: this day I am eighty-five years old,
<br>As strong as I was at that time when I was sent to view the land: the strength of that time continueth in me until this day, as well to fight as to march.
<br>Give me therefore this mountain, which the Lord promised, in thy hearing also, wherein are the Enacims, and cities great and strong: if so be the Lord will be with me, and I shall be able to destroy them, as he promised me.
<br>And Josue blessed him, and gave him He- bron in possession.
<br>And from that time Hebron belonged to Caleb the son of Jephone the Cenezite, until this present day: because he followed the Lord the God of Israel.
<br>The name of Hebron before was called
<br> 
<br>Cariath-Arbe: Adam the greatest among the Enacims was laid there and the land rested from wars.
<br>
<br>Chapter 15
<br>Now the lot of the children of Juda by their kin- dreds was this: From the frontier of Edom, to the desert of Sin southward, and to the utter- most part of the south coast.
<br>Its beginning was from the top of the most salt sea, and from the bay thereof, that looketh to the south.
<br>And it goeth out towards the ascent of the Scorpion, and passeth on to Sina: and ascendeth into Cadesbarne, and reacheth into Esron, going up to Addar, and compassing Carcaa.
<br>And from thence passing along into Ase- mona, and reaching the torrent of Egypt: and the bounds thereof shall be the great sea, this shall be the limit of the south coast.
<br>But on the east side the beginning shall be the most salt sea even to the end of the Jordan: and towards the north from the bay of the sea unto the same river Jordan.
<br>And the border goeth up into Beth-Hagla, and passeth by the north into Beth-Araba: going up to the stone of Boen the son of Ruben.
<br>And reaching as far as the borders of De- bara from the valley of Achor, and so northward looking towards Galgal, which is opposite to the ascent of Adommin, on the south side of the tor- rent, and the border passeth the waters that are called the fountain of the sun: and the goings out thereof shall be at the fountain Rogel.
<br>And it goeth up by the valley of the son of Ennom on the side of the Jebusite towards the south, the same is Jerusalem: and thence ascending to the top of the mountain, which is
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>over against Geennom to the west in the end of the valley of Raphaim, northward.
<br>And it passeth on from the top of the moun- tain to the fountain of the water of Nephtoa: and reacheth to the towns of mount Ephron: and it bendeth towards Baala, which is Cariathiarim, that is to say, the city of the woods.
<br>And it compasseth from Baala westward unto mount Seir: and passeth by the side of mount Jarim to the north into Cheslon: and goeth down into Bethsames, and passeth into Thamna.
<br>And reacheth northward to a part of Ac- caron at the side: and bendeth to Sechrona, and passeth mount Baala: and cometh into Jebneel, and is bounded westward with the great sea.
<br>These are the borders round about of the children of Juda in their kindreds.
<br>But to Caleb the son of Jephone he gave a portion in the midst of the children of Juda, as the Lord had commanded him: Cariath-Arbe the father of Enac, which is Hebron.
<br>And Caleb destroyed out of it the three sons of Enac, Sesai and Ahiman, and Tholmai of the race of Enac.
<br>And going up from thence he came to the inhabitants of Dabir, which before was called Cariath-Sepher, that is to say, the city of letters.
<br>And Caleb said: He that shall smite Cariath-Sepher, and take it, I will give him Axa my daughter to wife.
<br>And Othoniel the son of Cenez, the younger brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Axa his daughter to wife.
<br>And as they were going together, she was moved by her husband to ask a field of her father, and she sighed as she sat on her ass. And Caleb said to her: What aileth thee?
<br>But she answered: Give me a blessing: thou hast given me a southern and dry land, give
<br> 
<br>me also a land that Is watered. And Caleb gave her the upper and the nether watery ground.
<br>This is the possession of the tribe of the children of Juda by their kindreds.
<br>And the cities from the uttermost parts of the children of Juda by the borders of Edom to the south, were Cabseel and Eder and Jagur,
<br>And Cina and Dimona and Adada, 23 And Cades and Asor and Jethnam, 24 Ziph and Telem and Baloth,
<br>New Asor and Carioth, Hesron, which is Asor.
<br>Amam, Sama and Molada,
<br>And Asergadda and Hassemon and Beth- phelet,
<br>And Hasersual and Bersabee and Bazio- thia,
<br>And Baala and Jim and Esem,
<br>And Eltholad and Cesil and Harma,
<br>And Siceleg and Medemena and Sensenna,
<br>Lebaoth and Selim and Aen and Remmon: all the cities twenty-nine, and their villages.
<br>But in the plains: Estaol and Sarea and Asena,
<br>And Zanoe and Engannim and Taphua and Enaim,
<br>And Jerimoth and Adullam, Socho and Azeca,
<br>And Saraim and Adithaim and Gedera and Gederothaim: fourteen cities, and their villages.
<br>Sanan and Hadassa and Magdalgad, 38 Delean and Masepha and Jecthel, 39 Lachis and Bascath and Eglon,
<br>Chebbon and Leheman and Cethlis,
<br>And Gideroth and Bethdagon and Naama and Maceda: sixteen cities, and their villages.
<br>Labana and Ether and Asan,
<br>Jephtha and Esna and Nesib,
<br>And Ceila and Achzib and Maresa: nine cities, and their villages.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Accaron with the towns and villages thereof.
<br>From Accaron even to the sea: all places that lie towards Azotus and the villages thereof. 47 Azotus with its towns and villages. Gaza
<br>with its towns and villages, even to the torrent
<br>of Egypt, and the great sea that is the border thereof.
<br>And in the mountain Samir and Jether and Socoth,
<br>And Danna and Cariath-senna, this is Dabir:
<br>Anab and Istemo and Anim,
<br>Gosen and Olon and Gilo: eleven cities and their villages.
<br>Arab and Ruma and Esaan,
<br>And Janum and Beththaphua and Apheca,
<br>Athmatha and Cariath-Arbe, this is He- bron and Sior: nine cities and their villages.
<br>Maon and Carmel and Ziph and Jota,
<br>Jezrael and Jucadam and Zanoe,
<br>Accain, Gabaa and Thamna: ten cities and their villages.
<br>Halhul, and Bessur, and Gedor,
<br>Mareth, and Bethanoth, and Eltecon: six cities and their villages.
<br>Cariathbaal, the same is Cariathiarim the city of woods, and Arebba: two cities and their villages.
<br>In the desert Betharaba, Meddin and Sachacha,
<br>And Nebsan, and the city of salt, and En- gaddi: six cities and their villages.
<br>But the children of Juda could not de- stroy the Jebusite that dwelt in Jerusalem: and the Jebusite dwelt with the children of Juda in Jerusalem until this present day.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 16
<br>
<br>And the lot of the sons of Joseph fell from the Jordan over against Jericho and the waters thereof, on the east: the wilderness which goeth up from Jericho to the mountain of Bethel:
<br>And goeth out from Bethel to Luza: and passeth the border of Archi, to Ataroth,
<br>And goeth down westward, by the border of Jephleti, unto the borders of Beth-horon the nether, and to Gazer: and the countries of it are ended by the great sea:
<br>And Manasses and Ephraim the children of Joseph possessed it.
<br>And the border of the children of Ephraim was according to their kindreds: and their pos- session towards the east was Ataroth-addar unto Beth-horon the upper.
<br>And the confines go out unto the sea: but Machmethath looketh to the north, and it goeth round the borders eastward into Thanath-selo: and passeth along on the east side to Janoe.
<br>And it goeth down from Janoe into Ataroth and Naaratha: and it cometh to Jericho, and goeth out to the Jordan.
<br>From Taphua it passeth on towards the sea into the valley of reeds, and the goings out thereof are at the most salt sea. This is the pos- session of the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their families.
<br>And there were cities with their villages sep- arated for the children of Ephraim in the midst of the possession of the children of Manasses.
<br>And the children of Ephraim slew not the Chanaanite, who dwelt in Gazer: and the Chanaanite dwelt in the midst of Ephraim until this day, paying tribute.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 17
<br>And this lot fell to the tribe of Manasses for he is the firstborn of Joseph to Machir the firstborn of Manasses the father of Galaad, who was a warlike man, and had for possession Galaad and Basan.
<br>And to the rest of the children of Manasses according to their families: to the children of Abiezer, and to the children of Helec, and to the children of Esriel, and to the children of Sechem, and to the children of Hepher, and to the chil- dren of Semida: these are the male children of Manasses the son of Joseph, by their kindreds.
<br>But Salphaad the son of Hepher the son of Galaad the son of Machir the son of Manasses had no sons, but only daughters: whose names are these, Maala and Noa and Hegla and Melcha and Thersa.
<br>And they came in the presence of Eleazar the priest and of Josue the son of Nun, and of the princes, saying: The Lord commanded by the hand of Moses, that a possession should be given us in the midst of our brethren. And he gave them according to the commandment of the Lord a possession amongst the brethren of their father.
<br>And there fell ten portions to Manasses, be- side the land of Galaad and Basan beyond the Jordan.
<br>For the daughters of Manasses possessed in- heritance in the midst of his sons. And the land of Galaad fell to the lot of the rest of the children of Manasses.
<br>And the border of Manasses was from Aser, Machmethath which looketh towards Sichem: and it goeth out on the right hand by the in- habitants of the fountain of Taphua.
<br>For the lot of Manasses took in the land of Taphua, which is on the borders of Manasses,
<br> 
<br>and belongs to the children of Ephraim.
<br>And the border goeth down to the valley of the reeds, to the south of the torrent of the cities of Ephraim, which are in the midst of the cities of Manasses: the border of Manasses is on the north side of the torrent, and the outgoings of it are at the sea:
<br>So that the possession of Ephraim is on the south, and on the north that of Manasses, and the sea is the border of both, and they are joined together in the tribe of Aser on the north, and in the tribe of Issachar on the east.
<br>And the inheritance of Manasses in Is- sachar and in Aser, was Bethsan and its villages, and Jeblaam with its villages, and the inhabi- tants of Dor, with the towns thereof: the inhab- itants also of Endor with the villages thereof: and in like manner the inhabitants of Thenac with the villages thereof: and the inhabitants of Mageddo with their villages, and the third part of the city of Nopheth.
<br>Neither could the children of Manasses overthrow these cities, but the Chanaanite be- gan to dwell in his land.
<br>But after that the children of Israel were grown strong, they subdued the Chanaanites, and made them their tributaries, and they did not kill them.
<br>And the children of Joseph spoke to Josue, and said: Why hast thou given me but one lot and one portion to possess, whereas I am of so great a multitude, and the Lord hath blessed me? 15 And Josue said to them: If thou be a great people, go up into the woodland, and cut down room for thyself in the land of the Pherezite and the Raphaims: because the possession of mount
<br>Ephraim is too narrow for thee.
<br>16 And the children of Joseph answered him: We cannot go up to the mountains, for the Chanaanites that dwell in the low lands, wherein
