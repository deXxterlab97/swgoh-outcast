<br>with the lamb, so the sinner with the just.
<br>22	What fellowship hath a holy man with a dog, or what part hath the rich with the poor?
<br> 
<br>23	The wild ass is the lion’s prey in the desert: so also the poor are devoured by the rich.
<br>24	And as humility is an abomination to the proud: so also the rich man abhorreth the poor. 25 When a rich man is shaken, he is kept up by his friends: but when a poor man is fallen down,
<br>he is thrust away even by his acquaintance.
<br>26	When a rich man hath been deceived, he hath many helpers: he hath spoken proud things, and they have justified him.
<br>27	The poor man was deceived, and he is re- buked also: he hath spoken wisely, and could have no place.
<br>28	The rich man spoke, and all held their peace, and what he said they extol even to the clouds.
<br>29	The poor man spoke, and they say: Who is this? and if he stumble, they will overthrow him.
<br>30	Riches are good to him that hath no sin in his conscience: and poverty is very wicked in the mouth of the ungodly.
<br>31	The heart of a man changeth his counte- nance, either for good, or for evil.
<br>32	The token of a good heart, and a good countenance thou shalt hardly find, and with labour.
<br>
<br>Chapter 14
<br>Blessed is the man that hath not slipped by a word out of his mouth, and is not pricked with the remorse of sin.
<br>2	Happy is he that hath had no sadness of his mind, and who is not fallen from his hope.
<br>3	Riches are not comely for a covetous man and a niggard, and what should an envious man do with gold?
<br>4	He that gathereth together by wronging his
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>own soul, gathereth for others, and another will squander away his goods in rioting.
<br>5	He that is evil to himself, to whom will he be good? and he shall not take pleasure in his goods.
<br>6	There is none worse than he that envieth himself, and this is the reward of his wickedness: 7 And if he do good, he doth it ignorantly, and unwillingly: and at the last he discovereth
<br>his wickedness.
<br>8	The eye of the envious is wicked: and he tur- neth away his face, and despiseth his own soul.
<br>9	The eye of the covetous man is insatiable in his portion of iniquity: he will not be satisfied till he consume his own soul, drying it up.
<br>10	An evil eye is towards evil things: and he shall not have his fill of bread, but shall be needy and pensive at his own table.
<br>11	My son, if thou have any thing, do good to thyself, and offer to God worthy offerings.
<br>12	Remember that death is not slow, and that the covenant of hell hath been shewn to thee: for the covenant of this world shall surely die.
<br>13	Do good to thy friend before thou die, and according to thy ability, stretching out thy hand give to the poor.
<br>14	Defraud not thyself of the good day, and let not the part of a good gift overpass thee.
<br>15	Shalt thou not leave to others to divide by lot thy sorrows and labours?
<br>16	Give and take, and justify thy soul.
<br>17	Before thy death work justice: for in hell there is no finding food.
<br>18	All flesh shall fade as grass, and as the leaf that springeth out on a green tree.
<br>19	Some grow, and some fall off: so is the generation of flesh and blood, one cometh to an end, and another is born.
<br>20	Every work that is corruptible shall fail in the end: and the worker thereof shall go with it.
<br> 
<br>21	And every excellent work shall be justified: and the worker thereof shall be honoured therein. 22 Blessed is the man that shall continue in wisdom, and that shall meditate in his justice, and in his mind shall think of the all seeing eye
<br>of God.
<br>23	He that considereth her ways in his heart, and hath understanding in her secrets, who goeth after her as one that traceth, and stayeth in her ways.
<br>24	He who looketh in at her windows, and hearkeneth at her door.
<br>25	He that lodgeth near her house, and fas- tening a pin in her walls shall set up his tent high unto her, where good things shall rest in his lodging for ever.
<br>26	He shall set his children under her shelter, and shall lodge under her branches:
<br>27	He shall be protected under her covering from the heat, and shall rest in her glory.
<br>
<br>Chapter 15
<br>He that feareth God, will do good: and he that possesseth justice, shall lay hold on her,
<br>2	And she will meet him as an honourable mother, and will receive him as a wife married of a virgin.
<br>3	With the bread of life and understanding, she shall feed him, and give him the water of wholesome wisdom to drink: and she shall be made strong in him, and he shall not be moved. 4 And she shall hold him fast, and he shall not be confounded: and she shall exalt him among
<br>his neighbours.
<br>5	And in the midst of the church she shall open his mouth, and shall fill him with the spirit of wisdom and understanding, and shall clothe him with a robe of glory.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>6	She shall heap upon him a treasure of joy and gladness, and shall cause him to inherit an everlasting name.
<br>7	But foolish men shall not obtain her, and wise men shall meet her, foolish men shall not see her: for she is far from pride and deceit.
<br>8	Lying men shall be mindful of her: but men that speak truth shall be found with her, and shall advance, even till they come to the sight of God.
<br>9	Praise is not seemly in the mouth of a sinner:
<br>10	For wisdom came forth from God: for praise shall be with the wisdom of God, and shall abound in a faithful mouth, and the sovereign Lord will give praise unto it.
<br>11	Say not: It is through God, that she is not with me: for do not thou the things that he hateth.
<br>12	Say not: He hath caused me to err: for he hath no need of wicked men.
<br>13	The Lord hateth all abomination of error, and they that fear him shall not love it.
<br>14	God made man from the beginning, and left him in the hand of his own counsel.
<br>15	He added his commandments and precepts. 16 If thou wilt keep the commandments and perform acceptable fidelity for ever, they shall
<br>preserve thee.
<br>17	He hath set water and fire before thee: stretch forth thy hand to which thou wilt.
<br>18	Before man is life and death, good and evil, that which he shall choose shall be given him:
<br>19	For the wisdom of God is great, and he is strong in power, seeing all men without ceasing. 20 The eyes of the Lord are towards them that
<br>fear him, and he knoweth al the work of man.
<br>21	He hath commanded no man to do wickedly, and he hath given no man license to sin;
<br> 
<br>22	For he desireth not a multitude of faithless and unprofitable children.
<br>
<br>Chapter 16
<br>
<br>Rejoice not in ungodly children, if they be mul- tiplied: neither be delighted in them, if the fear of God be not with them.
<br>2	Trust not to their life, and respect not their labours.
<br>3	For better is one that feareth God, than a thousand ungodly children.
<br>4	And it is better to die without children, than to leave ungodly children.
<br>5	By one that is wise a country shall be in- habited, the tribe of the ungodly shall become desolate.
<br>6	Many such things hath my eyes seen, and greater things than these my ear hath heard.
<br>7	In the congregation of sinners a fire shall be kindled, and in an unbelieving nation wrath shall flame out.
<br>8	The ancient giants did not obtain pardon for their sins, who were destroyed trusting to their own strength:
<br>9	And he spared not the place where Lot so- journed, but abhorred them for the pride of their word.
<br>10	He had not pity on them, destroying the whole nation that extolled themselves in their sins.
<br>11	So did he with the six hundred thousand footmen, who were gathered together in the hardness of their heart: and if one had been stiff- necked, it is a wonder if he had escaped unpun- ished:
<br>12	For mercy and wrath are with him. He is mighty to forgive, and to pour out indignation:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>13	According as his mercy is, so his correction judgeth a man according to his works.
<br>14	The sinner shall not escape in his rapines, and the patience of him that sheweth mercy shall not be put off.
<br>15	All mercy shall make a place for every man according to the merit of his works, and accord- ing to the wisdom of his sojournment.
<br>16	Say not: I shall be hidden from God, and who shall remember me from on high?
<br>17	In such a multitude I shall not be known: for what is my soul in such an immense creation?
<br>18	Behold the heaven, and the heavens of heavens, the deep, and all the earth, and the things that are in them, shall be moved in his sight,
<br>19	The mountains also, and the hills, and the foundations of the earth: when God shall look upon them, they shall be shaken with trembling. 20 And in all these things the heart is sense-
<br>less: and every heart is understood by him.
<br>21	And his ways who shall understand, and the storm, which no eye of man shall see?
<br>22	For many of his works are hidden, but the works of his justice who shall declare? or who shall endure? for the testament is far from some, and the examination of all is in the end.
<br>23	He that wanteth understanding thinketh vain things, and the foolish, and erring man, thinketh foolish things.
<br>24	Hearken to me, my son, and learn the disci- pline of understanding, and attend to my words in thy heart.
<br>25	And I will shew forth good doctrine in eq- uity, and will seek to declare wisdom: and attend to my words in thy heart, whilst with equity of spirit I tell thee the virtues that God hath put upon his works from the beginning, and I shew forth in truth his knowledge.
<br> 
<br>26	The works of God are done in judgment from the beginning, and from the making of them he distinguished their parts, and their be- ginnings in their generations.
<br>27	He beautified their works for ever, they have neither hungered, nor laboured, and they have not ceased from their works.
<br>28	Nor shall any of them straiten his neigh- bour at any time.
<br>29	Be not thou incredulous to his word.
<br>30	After this God looked upon the earth, and filled it with his goods.
<br>31	The soul of every living thing hath shewn forth before the face thereof, and into it they return again.
<br>
<br>Chapter 17
<br>
<br>God created man of the earth, and made him after his own image.
<br>2	And he turned him into it again, and clothed him with strength according to himself.
<br>3	He gave him the number of his days and time, and gave him power over all things that are upon the earth.
<br>4	He put the fear of him upon all flesh, and he had dominion over beasts and fowls.
<br>5	He created of him a helpmate like to himself, he gave them counsel, and a tongue, and eyes, and ears, and a heart to devise: and he filled them with the knowledge of understanding.
<br>6	He created in them the science of the spirit, he fired their heart with wisdom, and shewed them both good and evil.
<br>7	He set his eye upon their hearts to shew them the greatness of his works:
<br>8	That they might praise the name which he hath sanctified: and glory in his wondrous act
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>that they might declare the glorious things of his works.
<br>9	Moreover he gave them instructions, and the law of life for an inheritance.
<br>10	He made an everlasting covenant with them, and he shewed them his justice and judg- ments.
<br>11	And their eye saw the majesty of his glory, and their ears heard his glorious voice, and he said to them: Beware of all iniquity.
<br>12	And he gave to every one of them com- mandment concerning his neighbour.
<br>13	Their ways are always before him, they are not hidden from his eyes.
<br>14	Over every nation he set a ruler.
<br>15	And Israel was made the manifest portion of God.
<br>16	And all their works are as the sun in the sight of God: and his eyes are continually upon their ways.
<br>17	Their covenants were not hid by their in- iquity, and all their iniquities are in the sight of God.
<br>18	The alms of a man is as a signet with him, and shall preserve the grace of a man as the apple of the eye:
<br>19	And afterward he shall rise up, and shall render them their reward, to every one upon their own head, and shall turn them down into the bowels of the earth.
<br>20	But to the penitent he hath given the way of justice, and he hath strengthened them that were fainting in patience, and hath appointed to them the lot of truth.
<br>21	Turn to the Lord, and forsake thy sins:
<br>22	Make thy prayer before the face of the Lord, and offend less.
<br>23	Return to the Lord, and turn away from thy injustice, and greatly hate abomination.
<br> 
<br>24	And know the justices and judgments of God, and stand firm in the lot set before thee, and in prayer to the most high God.
<br>25	Go to the side of the holy age, with them that live and give praise to God.
<br>26	Tarry not in the error of the ungodly, give glory before death. Praise perisheth from the dead as nothing.
<br>27	Give thanks whilst thou art living, whilst thou art alive and in health thou shalt give thanks, and shalt praise God, and shalt glory in his mercies.
<br>28	How great is the mercy of the Lord, and his forgiveness to them that turn to him !
<br>29	For all things cannot be in men, because the son of man is not immortal, and they are delighted with the vanity of evil.
<br>30	What is brighter than the sun; yet it shall be eclipsed. Or what is more wicked than that which flesh and blood hath invented? and this shall be reproved.
<br>31	He beholdeth the power of the height of heaven: and all men are earth and ashes.
<br>
<br>Chapter 18
<br>He that liveth for ever created all things to- gether. God only shall be justified, and he re- maineth an invincible king for ever.
<br>2	Who is able to declare his works?
<br>3	For who shall search out his glorious acts?
<br>4	And who shall show forth the power of his majesty? or who shall be able to declare his mercy?
<br>5	Nothing may be taken away, nor added, nei- ther is it possible to find out the glorious works of God.
<br>6	When a man hath done, then shall he begin: and when he leaveth off, he shall be at a loss.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>7	What is man, and what is his grace? and what is his good, or what is his evil?
<br>8	The number of the days of men at the most are a hundred years, as a drop of water of the sea are they esteemed: and as a pebble of the sand, so are a few years compared to eternity.
<br>9	Therefore God is patient in them, and poureth forth his mercy upon them.
<br>10	He hath seen the presumption of their heart that it is wicked, and hath known their end that it is evil.
<br>11	Therefore hath he filled up his mercy in their favour, and hath shewn them the way of justice.
<br>12	The compassion of man is toward his neigh- bour: but the mercy of God is upon all flesh.
<br>13	He hath mercy, and teacheth, and cor- recteth, as a shepherd doth his flock.
<br>14	He hath mercy on him that receiveth the discipline of mercy, and that maketh haste in his judgments.
<br>15	My son, in thy good deeds, make no com- plaint, and when thou givest any thing, add not grief by an evil word.
<br>16	Shall not the dew assuage the heat? so also the good word is better than the gift.
<br>17	Lo, is not a word better than a gift? but both are with a justified man.
<br>18	A fool will upbraid bitterly: and a gift of one ill taught consumeth the eyes.
<br>19	Before judgment prepare thee justice, and learn before thou speak.
<br>20	Before sickness take a medicine, and before judgment examine thyself, and thou shalt find mercy in the sight of God.
<br>21	Humble thyself before thou art sick, and in the time of sickness shew thy conversation.
<br>22	Let nothing hinder thee from praying al- ways, and be not afraid to be justified even to death: for the reward of God continueth for ever.
<br> 
<br>23	Before prayer prepare thy soul: and be not as a man that tempteth God.
<br>24	Remember the wrath that shall be at the last day, and the time of repaying when he shall turn away his face.
<br>25	Remember poverty in the time of abun- dance, and the necessities of poverty in the day of riches.
<br>26	From the morning until the evening the time shall be changed, and all these are swift in the eyes of God.
<br>27	A wise man will fear in every thing, and in the days of sins will beware of sloth.
<br>28	Every man of understanding knoweth wis- dom, and will give praise to him that findeth her.
<br>29	They that were of good understanding in words, have also done wisely themselves: and have understood truth and justice, and have poured forth proverbs and judgments.
<br>30	Go not after thy lusts, but turn away from thy own will.
<br>31	If thou give to thy soul her desires, she will make thee a joy to thy enemies.
<br>32	Take no pleasure in riotous assemblies, be they ever so small: for their concertation is con- tinual.
<br>33	Make not thyself poor by borrowing to con- tribute to feasts when thou hast nothing in thy purse: for thou shalt be an enemy to thy own life.
<br>
<br>Chapter 19
<br>A workman that is a drunkard shall not be rich: and he that contemneth small things, shall fall by little and little.
<br>2	Wine and women make wise men fall off, and shall rebuke the prudent:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>3	And he that joineth himself to harlots, will be wicked. Rottenness and worms shall inherit him, and he shall be lifted up for a greater ex- ample, and his soul shall be taken away out of the number.
<br>4	He that is hasty to give credit, is light of heart, and shall be lessened: and he that sinneth against his own soul, shall be despised.
<br>5	He that rejoiceth in iniquity, shall be cen- sured, and he that hateth chastisement, shall have less life: and he that hateth babbling, ex- tinguisheth evil.
<br>6	He that sinneth against his own soul, shall repent: and he that is delighted with wickedness, shall be condemned.
<br>7	Rehearse not again a wicked and harsh word, and thou shalt not fare the worse.
<br>8	Tell not thy mind to friend or foe: and if there be a sin with thee, disclose it not.
<br>9	For he will hearken to thee, and will watch thee, and as it were defending thy sin he will hate thee, and so will he be with thee always.
<br>10	Hast thou heard a word against thy neigh- bour? let it die within thee, trusting that it will not burst thee.
<br>11	At the hearing of a word the fool is in tra- vail, as a woman groaning in the bringing forth a child.
<br>12	As an arrow that sticketh in a man’s thigh: so is a word in the heart of a fool.
<br>13	Reprove a friend, lest he may not have un- derstood, and say: I did it not: or if he did it, that he may do it no more.
<br>14	Reprove thy neighbour, for it may be he hath not said it: and if he hath said it, that he may not say it again.
<br>15	Admonish thy friend: for there is often a fault committed.
<br>16	And believe not every word. There is one, that slippeth with the tongue, but not from his
<br> 
<br>heart.
<br>17	For who is there that hath not offended with his tongue? Admonish thy neighbour be- fore thou threaten him.
<br>18	And give place to the fear of the most High: for the fear of God is all wisdom, and therein is to fear God, and the disposition of the law is in all wisdom.
<br>19	But the learning of wickedness is not wis- dom: and the device of sinners is not prudence. 20 There is a subtle wickedness, and the same
<br>is detestable: and there is a man that is foolish, wanting in wisdom.
<br>21	Better is a man that hath less wisdom, and wanteth understanding, with the fear of God, than he that aboundeth in understanding, and transgresseth the law of the most High.
<br>22	There is an exquisite subtilty, and the same is unjust.
<br>23	And there is one that uttereth an exact word telling the truth. There is one that hum- bleth himself wickedly, and his interior is full of deceit:
<br>24	And there is one that submitteth himself exceedingly with a great lowliness: and there is one that casteth down his countenance, and maketh as if he did not see that which is un- known:
<br>25	And if he be hindered from sinning for want of power, if he shall find opportunity to do evil, he will do it.
<br>26	A man is known by his look, and a wise man, when thou meetest him, is known by his countenance.
<br>27	The attire of the body, and the laughter of the teeth, and the gait of the man, shew what he is.
<br>28	There is a lying rebuke in the anger of an injurious man: and there is a judgment that is
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>not allowed to be good: and there is one that holdeth his peace, he is wise.
<br>
<br>Chapter 20
<br>How much better is it to reprove, than to be angry, and not to hinder him that confesseth in prayer.
<br>2	The lust of an eunuch shall deflour a young maiden:
<br>3	So is he that by violence executeth of the unwise.
<br>4	How good is it, when thou art reproved, to shew repentance! for so thou shalt escape wilful sin.
<br>5	There is one that holdeth his peace, that is found wise: and there is another that is hateful, that is bold in speech.
<br>6	There is one that holdeth his peace, because he knoweth not what to say: and there is another that holdeth his peace, knowing the proper time. 7 A wise man will hold his peace till he see op- portunity: but a babbler, and a fool, will regard
<br>no time.
<br>8	He that useth many words shall hurt his own soul: and he that taketh authority to himself unjustly shall be hated.
<br>9	There is success in evil things to a man with- out discipline, and there is a finding that turneth to loss.
<br>10	There is a gift that is not profitable: and there is a gift, the recompense of which is double. 11 There is an abasement because of glory: and there is one that shall lift up his head from
<br>a low estate.
<br>12	There is that buyeth much for a small price, and restoreth the same sevenfold.
<br>13	A man wise in words shall make himself beloved: but the graces of fools shall be poured
<br> 
<br>out.
<br>14	The gift of the fool shall do thee no good: for his eyes are sevenfold.
<br>15	He will give a few things, and upbraid much: and the opening of his mouth is the kin- dling of a fire.
<br>16	To day a man lendeth, and to morrow he asketh it again: such a man as this is hateful.
<br>17	A fool shall have no friend, and there shall be no thanks for his good deeds.
<br>18	For they that eat his bread, are of a false tongue. How often, and how many will laugh him to scorn!
<br>19	For he doth not distribute with right un- derstanding that which was to be had: in like manner also that which was not to be had.
<br>20	The slipping of a false tongue is as one that falleth on the pavement: so the fall of the wicked shall come speedily.
<br>21	A man without grace is as a vain fable, it shall be continually in the mouth of the unwise. 22 A parable coming out of a fool’s mouth shall be rejected: for he doth not speak it in due
<br>season.
<br>23	There is that is hindered from sinning through want, and in his rest he shall be pricked.
<br>24	There is that will destroy his own soul through shamefacedness, and by occasion of an unwise person he will destroy it: and by respect of person he will destroy himself.
<br>25	There is that for bashfulness promiseth to his friend, and maketh him his enemy for noth- ing.
<br>26	A lie is a foul blot in a man, and yet it will be continually in the mouth of men without discipline.
<br>27	A thief is better than a man that is always lying: but both of them shall inherit destruction. 28 The manners of lying men are without hon- our: and their confusion is with them without
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>ceasing.
<br>29	A wise man shall advance himself with his words, and a prudent man shall please the great ones.
<br>30	He that tilleth his land shall make a high heap of corn: and he that worketh justice shall be exalted: and he that pleaseth great men shall escape iniquity.
<br>31	Presents and gifts blind the eyes of judges, and make them dumb in the mouth, so that they cannot correct.
<br>32	O Wisdom that is hid, and treasure that is not seen: what profit is there in them both?
<br>33	Better is he that hideth his folly, than the man that hideth his wisdom.
<br>
<br>Chapter 21
<br>
<br>My son, hast thou sinned? do so no more: but for thy former sins also pray that they may be forgiven thee.
<br>2	Flee from sins as from the face of a serpent: for if thou comest near them, they will take hold of thee.
<br>3	The teeth thereof are the teeth of a lion, killing the souls of men.
<br>4	All iniquity is like a two-edged sword, there is no remedy for the wound thereof.
<br>5	Injuries and wrongs will waste riches: and the house that is very rich shall be brought to nothing by pride: so the substance of the proud shall be rooted out.
<br>6	The prayer out of the mouth of the poor shall reach the ears of God, and judgment shall come for him speedily.
<br>7	He that hateth to be reproved walketh in the trace of a sinner: and he that feareth God will turn to his own heart.
<br> 
<br>8	He that is mighty by a bold tongue is known afar off, but a wise man knoweth to slip by him. 9 He that buildeth his house at other men’s charges, is as he that gathereth himself stones to
<br>build in the winter.
<br>10	The congregation of sinners is like tow heaped together, and the end of them is a flame of fire.
<br>11	The way of sinners is made plain with stones, and in their end is hell, and darkness, and pains.
<br>12	He that keepeth justice shall get the un- derstanding thereof.
<br>13	The perfection of the fear of God is wisdom and understanding.
<br>14	He that is not wise in good, will not be taught.
<br>15	But there is a wisdom that aboundeth in evil: and there is no understanding where there is bitterness.
<br>16	The knowledge of a wise man shall abound like a flood, and his counsel continueth like a fountain of life.
<br>17	The heart of a fool is like a broken vessel, and no wisdom at all shall it hold.
<br>18	A man of sense will praise every wise word he shall hear, and will apply it to himself: the luxurious man hath heard it, and it shall dis- please him, and he will cast it behind his back.
<br>19	The talking of a fool is like a burden in the way: but in the lips of the wise, grace shall be found.
<br>20	The mouth of the prudent is sought after in the church, and they will think upon his words in their hearts.
<br>21	As a house that is destroyed, so is wisdom to a fool: and the knowledge of the unwise is as words without sense.
<br>22	Doctrine to a fool is as fetters on the feet, and like manacles on the right hand.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>23	A fool lifteth up his voice in laughter: but a wise man will scarce laugh low to himself.
<br>24	Learning to the prudent is as an ornament of gold, and like a bracelet upon his right arm.
<br>25	The foot of a fool is soon in his neighbour’s house: but a man of experience will be abashed at the person of the mighty.
<br>26	A fool will peep through the window into the house: but he that is well taught will stand without.
<br>27	It is the folly of a man to hearken at the door: and a wise man will be grieved with the disgrace.
<br>28	The lips of the unwise will be telling fool- ish things: but the words of the wise shall be weighed in a balance.
<br>29	The heart of fools is in their mouth: and the mouth of wise men is in their heart.
<br>30	While the ungodly curseth the devil, he curseth his own soul.
<br>31	The talebearer shall defile his own soul, and shall be hated by all: and he that shall abide with him shall be hateful: the silent and wise man shall be honoured.
<br>
<br>Chapter 22
<br>The sluggard is pelted with a dirty stone, and all men will speak of his disgrace.
<br>2	The sluggard is pelted with the dung of oxen: and every one that toucheth him will shake his hands.
<br>3	A son ill taught is the confusion of the father: and a foolish daughter shall be to his loss.
<br>4	A wise daughter shall bring an inheritance to her husband: but she that confoundeth, be- cometh a disgrace to her father.
<br>5	She that is bold shameth both her father and husband, and will not be inferior to the ungodly:
<br> 
<br>and shall be disgraced by them both.
<br>6	A tale out of time is like music in mourning: but the stripes and instruction of wisdom are never out of time.
<br>7	He that teacheth a fool, is like one that glueth a potsherd together.
<br>8	He that telleth a word to him that heareth not, is like one that waketh a man out of a deep sleep.
<br>9	He speaketh with one that is asleep, who uttereth wisdom to a fool: and in the end of the discourse he saith: Who is this?
<br>10	Weep for the dead, for his light hath failed: and weep for the fool, for his understanding faileth.
<br>11	Weep but a little for the dead, for he is at rest.
<br>12	For the wicked life of a wicked fool is worse than death.
<br>13	The mourning for the dead is seven days: but for a fool and an ungodly man all the days of their life.
<br>14	Talk not much with a fool and go not with him that hath no sense.
<br>15	Keep thyself from him, that thou mayst not have trouble, and thou shalt not be defiled with his sin.
<br>16	Turn away from him, and thou shalt find rest, and shalt not be wearied out with his folly. 17 What is heavier than lead? and what other
<br>name hath he but fool?
<br>18	Sand and salt, and a mass of iron is easier to bear, than a man without sense, that is both foolish and wicked.
<br>19	A frame of wood bound together in the foundation of a building, shall not be loosed: so neither shall the heart that is established by ad- vised counsel.
<br>20	The thought of him that is wise at all times, shall not be depraved by fear.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>21	As pales set in high places, and plasterings made without cost, will not stand against the face of the wind:
<br>22	So also a fearful heart in the imagination of a fool shall not resist against the violence of fear.
<br>23	As a fearful heart in the thought of a fool at all times will not fear, so neither shall he that continueth always in the commandments of God.
<br>24	He that pricketh the eye, bringeth out tears: and he that pricketh the heart, bringeth forth resentment.
<br>25	He that flingeth a stone at birds, shall drive them away: so he that upbraideth his friend, breaketh friendship.
<br>26	Although thou hast drawn a sword at a friend, despair not: for there may be a returning. To a friend,
<br>27	If thou hast opened a sad mouth, fear not, for there may be a reconciliation: except up- braiding, and reproach, and pride, and disclos- ing of secrets, or a treacherous wound: for in all these cases a friend will flee away.
<br>28	Keep fidelity with a friend in his poverty, that in his prosperity also thou mayst rejoice.
<br>29	In the time of his trouble continue faithful to him, that thou mayst also be heir with him in his inheritance.
<br>30	As the vapour of a chimney, and the smoke of the fire goeth up before the fire: so also inju- rious words, and reproaches, and threats, before blood.
<br>31	I will not be ashamed to salute a friend, neither will I hide myself from his face: and if any evil happen to me by him, I will bear it.
<br>32	But every one that shall hear it, will beware of him.
<br>33	Who will set a guard before my mouth, and a sure seal upon my lips, that I fall not by them, and that my tongue destroy me not?
<br> 
<br>Chapter 23
<br>
<br>O Lord, father, and sovereign ruler of my life, leave me not to their counsel: nor suffer me to fall by them.
<br>2	Who will set scourges over my thoughts, and the discipline of wisdom over my heart, that they spare me not in their ignorances, and that their sins may not appear:
<br>3	Lest my ignorances increase, and my offences be multiplied, and my sins abound, and I fall be- fore my adversaries, and my enemy rejoice over me?
<br>4	O Lord, father, and God of my life, leave me not to their devices.
<br>5	Give me not haughtiness of my eyes, and turn away from me all coveting.
<br>6	Take from me the greediness of the belly, and let not the lusts of the flesh take hold of me, and give me not over to a shameless and foolish mind.
<br>7	Hear, O ye children, the discipline of the mouth, and he that will keep it shall not per- ish by his lips, nor be brought to fall into most wicked works.
<br>8	A sinner is caught in his own vanity, and the proud and the evil speakers shall fall thereby.
<br>9	Let not thy mouth be accustomed to swear- ing: for in it there are many falls.
<br>10	And let not the naming of God be usual in thy mouth, and meddle not with the names of saints, for thou shalt not escape free from them. 11 For as a slave daily put to the question,
<br>is never without a blue mark: so every one that sweareth, and nameth, shall not be wholly pure from sin.
<br>12 A man that sweareth much, shall be filled with iniquity, and a scourge shall not depart from his house.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>13 And if he make it void, his sin shall be upon him, and if he dissemble it, he offendeth double: 14 And if he swear in vain, he shall not be justified: for his house shall be filled with his
<br>punishment.
<br>15	There is also another speech opposite to death, let it not be found in the inheritance of Jacob.
<br>16	For from the merciful all these things shall be taken away, and they shall not wallow in sins. 17 Let not thy mouth be accustomed to indis-
<br>creet speech: for therein is the word of sin.
<br>18	Remember thy father and thy mother, for thou sittest in the midst of great men:
<br>19	Lest God forget thee in their sight, and thou, by thy daily custom be infatuated and suf- fer reproach: and wish that thou hadst not been born, and curse the day of thy nativity.
<br>20	The man that is accustomed to opprobrious words, will never be corrected all the days of his life.
<br>21	Two sorts of men multiply sins, and the third bringeth wrath and destruction.
<br>22	A hot soul is a burning fire, it will never be quenched, till it devour some thing.
<br>23	And a man that is wicked in the mouth of his flesh, will not leave off till he hath kindled a fire.
<br>24	To a man that is a fornicator all bread is sweet, he will not be weary of sinning unto the end.
<br>25	Every man that passeth beyond his own bed, despising his own soul, and saying: Who seeth me?
<br>26	Darkness compasseth me about, and the walls cover me, and no man seeth me: whom do I fear? the most High will not remember my sins.
<br>27	And he understandeth not that his eye seeth all things, for such a man’s fear driveth
<br> 
<br>him from the fear of God, and the eyes of men fearing him:
<br>28	And he knoweth not that the eyes of the Lord are far brighter than the sun, beholding round about all the ways of men, and the bottom of the deep, and looking into the hearts of men, into the most hidden parts.
<br>29	For all things were known to the Lord God, before they were created: so also after they were perfected he beholdeth all things.
<br>30	This man shall be punished in the streets of the city, and he shall be chased as a colt: and where he suspected not, he shall be taken.
<br>31	And he shall be in disgrace with all men, because he understood not the fear of the Lord.
<br>32	So every woman also that leaveth her hus- band, and bringeth in an heir by another:
<br>33	For first she hath been unfaithful to the law of the most High: and secondly, she hath offended against her husband: thirdly, she hath fornicated in adultery, and hath gotten her chil- dren of another man.
<br>34	This woman shall be brought into the as- sembly, and inquisition shall be made of her chil- dren.
<br>35	Her children shall not take root, and her branches shall bring forth no fruit.
<br>36	She shall leave her memory to be cursed, and her infamy shall not be blotted out.
<br>37	And they that remain shall know, that there is nothing better than the fear of God: and that there is nothing sweeter than to have regard to the commandments of the Lord.
<br>38	It is great glory to follow the Lord: for length of days shall be received from him.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 24
<br>Wisdom shall praise her own self, and shall be honoured in God, and shall glory in the midst of her people,
<br>2	And shall open her mouth in the churches of the most High, and shall glorify herself in the sight of his power,
<br>3	And in the midst of her own people she shall be exalted, and shall be admired in the holy as- sembly.
<br>4	And in the multitude of the elect she shall have praise, and among the blessed she shall be blessed, saying:
<br>5	I came out of the mouth of the most High, the firstborn before all creatures:
<br>6	I made that in the heavens there should rise light that never faileth, and as a cloud I covered all the earth:
<br>7	I dwelt in the highest places, and my throne is in a pillar of a cloud.
<br>8	I alone have compassed the circuit of heaven, and have penetrated into the bottom of the deep, and have walked in the waves of the sea,
<br>9	And have stood in all the earth: and in every people,
<br>10	And in every nation I have had the chief rule:
<br>11	And by my power I have trodden under my feet the hearts of all the high and low: and in all these I sought rest, and I shall abide in the inheritance of the Lord.
<br>12	Then the creator of all things commanded, and said to me: and he that made me, rested in my tabernacle,
<br>13	And he said to me: Let thy dwelling be in Jacob, and thy inheritance in Israel, and take root in my elect.
<br>14	From the beginning, and before the world, was I created, and unto the world to come I shall
<br> 
<br>not cease to be, and in the holy dwelling place I have ministered before him.
<br>15	And so was I established in Sion, and in the holy city likewise I rested, and my power was in Jerusalem.
<br>16	And I took root in an honourable people, and in the portion of my God his inheritance, and my abode is in the full assembly of saints.
<br>17	I was exalted like a cedar in Libanus, and as a cypress tree on mount Sion.
<br>18	I was exalted like a palm tree in Cades, and as a rose plant in Jericho:
<br>19	As a fair olive tree in the plains, and as a plane tree by the water in the streets, was I exalted.
<br>20	I gave a sweet smell like cinnamon, and aromatical balm: I yielded a sweet odour like the best myrrh:
<br>21	And I perfumed my dwelling as storax, and galbanum, and onyx, and aloes, and as the frank- incense not cut, and my odour is as the purest balm.
<br>22	I have stretched out my branches as the turpentine tree, and my branches are of honour and grace.
<br>23	As the vine I have brought forth a pleasant odour: and my flowers are the fruit of honour and riches.
<br>24	I am the mother of fair love, and of fear, and of knowledge, and of holy hope.
<br>25	In me is all grace of the way and of the truth, in me is all hope of life and of virtue.
<br>26	Come over to me, all ye that desire me, and be filled with my fruits.
<br>27	For my spirit is sweet above honey, and my inheritance above honey and the honeycomb.
<br>28	My memory is unto everlasting genera- tions.
<br>29	They that eat me, shall yet hunger: and they that drink me, shall yet thirst.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>30	He that hearkeneth to me, shall not be con- founded: and they that work by me, shall not sin.
<br>31	They that explain me shall have life ever- lasting.
<br>32	All these things are the book of life, and the covenant of the most High, and the knowledge of truth.
<br>33	Moses commanded a law in the precepts of justices, and an inheritance to the house of Jacob, and the promises to Israel.
<br>34	He appointed to David his servant to raise up of him a most mighty king, and sitting on the throne of glory for ever.
<br>35	Who filleth up wisdom as the Phison, and as the Tigris in the days of the new fruits.
<br>36	Who maketh understanding to abound as the Euphrates, who multiplieth it as the Jordan in the time of harvest.
<br>37	Who sendeth knowledge as the light, and riseth up as Gehon in the time of the vintage.
<br>38	Who first hath perfect knowledge of her, and a weaker shall not search her out.
<br>39	For her thoughts are more vast than the sea, and her counsels more deep than the great ocean.
<br>40	I, wisdom, have poured out rivers.
<br>41	I, like a brook out of a river of a mighty water; I, like a channel of a river, and like an aqueduct, came out of paradise.
<br>42	I said: I will water my garden of plants, and I will water abundantly the fruits of my meadow. 43 And behold my brook became a great river,
<br>and my river came near to a sea:
<br>44	For I make doctrine to shine forth to all as the morning light, and I will declare it afar off.
<br>45	I will penetrate to all the lower parts of the earth, and will behold all that sleep, and will enlighten all that hope in the Lord.
<br> 
<br>46	I will yet pour out doctrine as prophecy, and will leave it to them that seek wisdom, and will not cease to instruct their offspring even to the holy age.
<br>47	See ye that I have not laboured myself only, but for all that seek out the truth.
<br>
<br>Chapter 25
<br>
<br>With three things my spirit is pleased, which are approved before God and men:
<br>2	The concord of brethren, and the love of neighbours, and man and wife that agree well together.
<br>3	Three sorts my soul hateth, and I am greatly grieved at their life:
<br>4	A poor man that is proud: a rich man that is a liar: an old man that is a fool, and doting.
<br>5	The things that thou hast not gathered in thy youth, how shalt thou find them in thy old age?
<br>6	O how comely is judgment for a grey head, and for ancients to know counsel!
<br>7	O how comely is wisdom for the aged, and understanding and counsel to men of honour!
<br>8	Much experience is the crown of old men, and the fear of God is their glory.
<br>9	Nine things that are not to be imagined by the heart have I magnified, and the tenth I will utter to men with my tongue.
<br>10	A man that hath joy of his children: and he that liveth and seeth the fall of his enemies.
<br>11	Blessed is he that dwelleth with a wise woman, and that hath not slipped with his tongue, and that hath not served such as are unworthy of him.
<br>12	Blessed is he that findeth a true friend, and that declareth justice to an ear that heareth.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>13	How great is he that findeth wisdom and knowledge! but there is none above him that feareth the Lord.
<br>14	The fear of God hath set itself above all things:
<br>15	Blessed is the man, to whom it is given to have the fear of God: he that holdeth it, to whom shall he be likened?
<br>16	The fear of God is the beginning of his love: and the beginning of faith is to be fast joined unto it.
<br>17	The sadness of the heart is every plague: and the wickedness of a woman is all evil.
<br>18	And a man will choose any plague, but the plague of the heart:
<br>19	And any wickedness, but the wickedness of a woman:
<br>20	And any affliction, but the affliction from them that hate him:
<br>21	And any revenge, but the revenge of ene- mies.
<br>22	There is no head worse than the head of a serpent:
<br>23	And there is no anger above the anger of a woman. It will be more agreeable to abide with a lion and a dragon, than to dwell with a wicked woman.
<br>24	The wickedness of a woman changeth her face: and she darkeneth her countenance as a bear: and sheweth it like sackcloth. In the midst of her neighbours,
<br>25	Her husband groaned, and hearing he sighed a little.
<br>26	All malice is short to the malice of a woman, let the lot of sinners fall upon her.
<br>27	As the climbing of a sandy way is to the feet of the aged, so is a wife full of tongue to a quiet man.
<br>28	Look not upon a woman’s beauty, and de- sire not a woman for beauty.
<br> 
<br>29	A woman’s anger, and impudence, and con- fusion is great.
<br>30	A woman, if she have superiority, is con- trary to her husband.
<br>31	A wicked woman abateth the courage, and maketh a heavy countenance, and a wounded heart.
<br>32	Feeble hands, and disjointed knees, a woman that doth not make her husband happy. 33 From  the  woman  came the  beginning  of
<br>sin, and by her we all die.
<br>34	Give no issue to thy water, no, not a little: nor to a wicked woman liberty to gad abroad.
<br>35	If she walk not at thy hand, she will con- found thee in the sight of thy enemies.
<br>36	Cut her off from thy flesh, lest she always abuse thee.
<br>
<br>Chapter 26
<br>Happy is the husband of a good wife: for the number of his years is double.
<br>2	A virtuous woman rejoiceth her husband, and shall fulfil the years of his life in peace.
<br>3	A good wife is a good portion, she shall be given in the portion of them that fear God, to a man for his good deeds.
<br>4	Rich or poor, if his heart is good, his coun- tenance shall be cheerful at all times.
<br>5	Of three things my heart hath been afraid, and at the fourth my face hath trembled:
<br>6	The accusation of a city, and the gathering together of the people:
<br>7	And a false calumny, all are more grievous than death.
<br>8	A jealous woman is the grief and mourning of the heart.
<br>9	With a jealous woman is a scourge of the tongue which communicateth with all.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>10	As a yoke of oxen that is moved to and fro, so also is a wicked woman: he that hath hold of her, is as he that taketh hold of a scorpion.
<br>11	A drunken woman is a great wrath: and her reproach and shame shall not be hid.
<br>12	The fornication of a woman shall be known by the haughtiness of her eyes and by her eyelids. 13 On a daughter that turneth not away her- self, set a strict watch: lest finding an opportu-
<br>nity she abuse herself.
<br>14	Take heed of the impudence of her eyes, and wonder not if she slight thee.
<br>15	She will open her mouth as a thirsty trav- eller to the fountain, and will drink of every wa- ter near her, and will sit down by every hedge, and open her quiver against every arrow, until she fail.
<br>16	The grace of a diligent woman shall delight her husband, and shall fat his bones.
<br>17	Her discipline is the gift of God.
<br>18	Such is a wise and silent woman, and there is nothing so much worth as a well instructed soul.
<br>19	A holy and shamefaced woman is grace upon grace.
<br>20	And no price is worthy of a continent soul. 21 As the sun when it riseth to the world in the high places of God, so is the beauty of a good
<br>wife for the ornament of her house.
<br>22	As the lamp shining upon the holy candle- stick, so is the beauty of the face in a ripe age,
<br>23	As golden pillars upon bases of silver, so are the firm feet upon the soles of a steady woman.
<br>24	As everlasting foundations upon a solid rock, so the commandments of God in the heart of a holy woman.
<br>25	At two things my heart is grieved, and the third bringeth anger upon me.
<br>26	A man of war fainting through poverty, and a man of sense despised:
<br> 
<br>27	And he that passeth over from justice to sin, God hath prepared such an one for the sword.
<br>28	Two sorts of callings have appeared to me hard and dangerous: a merchant is hardly free from negligence: and a huckster shall not be jus- tified from the sins of the lips.
<br>
<br>Chapter 27
<br>
<br>Through poverty many have sinned: and he that seeketh to be enriched, turneth away his eye.
<br>2	As a stake sticketh fast in the midst of the joining of stones, so also in the midst of selling and buying, sin shall stick fast.
<br>3	Sin shall be destroyed with the sinner.
<br>4	Unless thou hold thyself diligently in the fear of the Lord, thy house shall quickly be over- thrown.
<br>5	As when one sifteth with a sieve, the dust will remain: so will the perplexity of a man in his thoughts.
<br>6	The furnace trieth the potter’s vessels, and the trial of affliction just men.
<br>7	As the dressing of a tree sheweth the fruit thereof, so a word out of the thought of the heart of man.
<br>8	Praise not a man before he speaketh, for this is the trial of men.
<br>9	If thou followest justice, thou shalt obtain her: and shalt put her on as a long robe of hon- our, and thou shalt dwell with her: and she shall protect thee for ever, and in the day of acknowl- edgment thou shalt find a strong foundation.
<br>10	Birds resort unto their like: so truth will return to them that practise her.
<br>11	The lion always lieth in wait for prey: so do sins for them that work iniquities.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>12	A holy man continueth in wisdom as the sun: but a fool is changed as the moon.
<br>13	In the midst of the unwise keep in the word till its time: but be continually among men that think.
<br>14	The discourse of sinners is hateful, and their laughter is at the pleasures of sin.
<br>15	The speech that sweareth much shall make the hair of the head stand upright: and its irrev- erence shall make one stop his ears.
<br>16	In the quarrels of the road is the shedding of blood: and their cursing is a grievous hearing. 17 He that discloseth the secret of a friend loseth his credit, and shall never find a friend to
<br>his mind.
<br>18	Love thy neighbour, and be joined to him with fidelity.
<br>19	But if thou discover his secrets, follow no more after him.
<br>20	For as a man that destroyeth his friend, so is he that destroyeth the friendship of his neigh- bour.
<br>21	And as one that letteth a bird go out of his hand, so hast thou let thy neighbour go, and thou shalt not get him again.
<br>22	Follow after him no more, for he is gone afar off, he is fled, as a roe escaped out of the snare because his soul is wounded.
<br>23	Thou canst no more bind him up. And of a curse there is reconciliation:
<br>24	But to disclose the secrets of a friend, leaveth no hope to an unhappy soul.
<br>25	He that winketh with the eye forgeth wicked things, and no man will cast him off:
<br>26	In the sight of thy eyes he will sweeten his mouth, and will admire thy words: but at the last he will writhe his mouth, and on thy words he will lay a stumblingblock.
<br>27	I have hated many things but not like him, and the Lord will hate him.
<br> 
<br>28	If one cast a stone on high, it will fall upon his own head: and the deceitful stroke will wound the deceitful.
<br>29	He that diggeth a pit, shall fall into it: and he that setteth a stone for his neighbour, shall stumble upon it: and he that layeth a snare for another, shall perish in it.
<br>30	A mischievous counsel shall be rolled back upon the author, and he shall not know from whence it cometh to him.
<br>31	Mockery and reproach are of the proud, and vengeance as a lion shall lie in wait for him. 32 They shall perish in a snare that are de- lighted with the fall of the just: and sorrow shall
<br>consume them before they die.
<br>33 Anger and fury are both of them abom- inable, and the sinful man shall be subject to them.
<br>
<br>Chapter 28
<br>
<br>He that seeketh to revenge himself, shall find vengeance from the Lord, and he will surely keep his sins in remembrance.
<br>2	Forgive thy neighbour if he hath hurt thee: and then shall thy sins be forgiven to thee when thou prayest.
<br>3	Man to man reserveth anger, and doth he seek remedy of God?
<br>4	He hath no mercy on a man like himself, and doth he entreat for his own sins?
<br>5	He that is but flesh, nourisheth anger, and doth he ask forgiveness of God? who shall obtain pardon for his sins?
<br>6	Remember thy last things, and let enmity cease:
<br>7	For corruption and death hang over in his commandments.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>8	Remember the fear of God, and be not angry with thy neighbour.
<br>9	Remember the covenant of the most High, and overlook the ignorance of thy neighbour.
<br>10	Refrain from strife, and thou shalt diminish thy sins.
<br>11	For a passionate man kindleth strife, and a sinful man will trouble his friends, and bring in debate in the midst of them that are at peace.
<br>12	For as the wood of the forest is, so the fire burneth, and as a man’s strength is, so shall his anger be, and according to his riches he shall increase his anger.
<br>13	A hasty contention kindleth a fire and a hasty quarrel sheddeth blood and a tongue that beareth witness bringeth death.
<br>14	If thou blow the spark, it shall burn as a fire: and if thou spit upon it, it shall be quenched: both come out of the mouth.
<br>15	The whisperer and the double tongue is accursed: for he hath troubled many that were at peace.
<br>16	The tongue of a third person hath disqui- eted many, and scattered them from nation to nation.
<br>17	It hath destroyed the strong cities of the rich, and hath overthrown the houses of great men.
<br>18	It hath cut in pieces the forces of people, and undone strong nations.
<br>19	The tongue of a third person hath cast out valiant women, and deprived them of their labours.
<br>20	He that hearkeneth to it, shall never have rest, neither shall he have a friend in whom he may repose.
<br>21	The stroke of a whip maketh a blue mark: but the stroke of the tongue will break the bones. 22 Many have fallen by the edge of the sword, but not so many as have perished by their own
<br> 
<br>tongue.
<br>23	Blessed is he that is defended from a wicked tongue, that hath not passed into the wrath thereof, and that hath not drawn the yoke thereof, and hath not been bound in its bands.
<br>24	For its yoke is a yoke of iron: and its bands are bands of brass.
<br>25	The death thereof is a most evil death: and hell is preferable to it.
<br>26	Its continuance shall not be for a long time, but it shall possess the ways of the unjust: and the just shall not be burnt with its flame.
<br>27	They that forsake God shall fall into it, and it shall burn in them, and shall not be quenched, and it shall be sent upon them as a lion, and as a leopard it shall tear them.
<br>28	Hedge in thy ears with thorns, hear not a wicked tongue, and make doors and bars to thy mouth.
<br>29	Melt down thy gold and silver, and make a balance for thy words, and a just bridle for thy mouth:
<br>30	And take heed lest thou slip with thy tongue, and fall in the sight of thy enemies who lie in wait for thee, and thy fall be incurable unto death.
<br>
<br>Chapter 29
<br>He that sheweth mercy, lendeth to his neighbour: and he that is stronger in hand, keepeth the com- mandments.
<br>2	Lend to thy neighbour in the time of his need, and pay thou thy neighbour again in due time.
<br>3	Keep thy word, and deal faithfully with him: and thou shalt always find that which is neces- sary for thee.
<br>4	Many have looked upon a thing lent as a
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>thing found, and have given trouble to them that helped them.
<br>5	Till they receive, they kiss the hands of the lender, and in promises they humble their voice: 6 But when they should repay, they will ask time, and will return tedious and murmuring
<br>words, and will complain of the time:
<br>7	And if he be able to pay, he will stand off, he will scarce pay one half, and will count it as if he had found it:
<br>8	But if not, he will defraud him of his money, and he shall get him for an enemy without cause. 9 And he will pay him with reproaches and curses, and instead of honour and good turn will
<br>repay him injuries.
<br>10	Many have refused to lend, not out of wickedness, but they were afraid to be defrauded without cause.
<br>11	But yet towards the poor be thou more hearty, and delay not to shew him mercy.
<br>12	Help the poor because of the command- ment: and send him not away empty handed because of his poverty.
<br>13	Lose thy money for thy brother and thy friend: and hide it not under a stone to be lost. 14 Place thy treasure in the commandments of the most High, and it shall bring thee more
<br>profit than gold.
<br>15	Shut up alms in the heart of the poor, and it shall obtain help for thee against all evil.
<br>16	Better than the shield of the mighty, and better than the spear:
<br>17	It shall fight for thee against thy enemy.
<br>18	A good man is surety for his neighbour: and he that hath lost shame, will leave him to himself.
<br>19	Forget not the kindness of thy surety: for he hath given his life for thee.
<br>20	The sinner and the unclean fleeth from his surety.
<br> 
<br>21	A sinner attributeth to himself the goods of his surety: and he that is of an unthankful mind will leave him that delivered him.
<br>22	A man is surety for his neighbour: and when he hath lost all shame, he shall forsake him.
<br>23	Evil suretyship hath undone many of good estate, and hath tossed them as a wave of the sea.
<br>24	It hath made powerful men to go from place to place round about, and they have wandered in strange countries.
<br>25	A sinner that transgresseth the command- ment of the Lord, shall fall into an evil surety- ship: and he that undertaketh many things, shall fall into judgment.
<br>26	Recover thy neighbour according to thy power, and take heed to thyself that thou fall not.
<br>27	The chief thing for man’s life is water and bread, and clothing, and a house to cover shame. 28 Better is the poor man’s fare under a roof of boards, than sumptuous cheer abroad in another
<br>man’s house.
<br>29	Be contented with little instead of much, and thou shalt not hear the reproach of going abroad.
<br>30	It is a miserable life to go as a guest from house to house: for where a man is a stranger, he shall not deal confidently, nor open his mouth.
<br>31	He shall entertain and feed, and give drink to the unthankful, and moreover he shall hear bitter words.
<br>32	Go, stranger, and furnish the table, and give others to eat what thou hast in thy hand.
<br>33	Give place to the honourable presence of my friends: for I want my house, my brother being to be lodged with me.
<br>34	These things are grievous to a man of un- derstanding: the upbraiding of houseroom, and
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>the reproaching of the lender.
<br>
<br>Chapter 30
<br>
<br>He that loveth his son, frequently chastiseth him, that he may rejoice in his latter end, and not grope after the doors of his neighbours.
<br>2	He that instructeth his son shall be praised in him, and shall glory in him in the midst of them of his household.
<br>3	He that teacheth his son, maketh his enemy jealous, and in the midst of his friends he shall glory in him.
<br>4	His father is dead, and he is as if he were not dead: for he hath left one behind him that is like himself.
<br>5	While he lived he saw and rejoiced in him: and when he died he was not sorrowful, neither was he confounded before his enemies.
<br>6	For he left behind him a defender of his house against his enemies, and one that will re- quite kindness to his friends.
<br>7	For the souls of his sons he shall bind up his wounds, and at every cry his bowels shall be troubled.
<br>8	A horse not broken becometh stubborn, and a child left to himself will become headstrong.
<br>9	Give thy son his way, and he shall make thee afraid: play with him, and he shall make thee sorrowful.
<br>10	Laugh not with him, lest thou have sorrow, and at the last thy teeth be set on edge.
<br>11	Give him not liberty in his youth, and wink not at his devices.
<br>12	Bow down his neck while he is young, and beat his sides while he is a child, lest he grow stubborn, and regard thee not, and so be a sor- row of heart to thee.
<br> 
<br>13	Instruct thy son, and labour about him, lest his lewd behaviour be an offence to thee.
<br>14	Better is a poor man who is sound, and strong of constitution, than a rich man who is weak and afflicted with evils.
<br>15	Health of the soul in holiness of justice, is better than all gold and silver: and a sound body, than immense revenues.
<br>16	There is no riches above the riches of the health of the body: and there is no pleasure above the joy of the heart.
<br>17	Better is death than a bitter life, and ev- erlasting rest, than continual sickness.
<br>18	Good things that are hidden in a mouth that is shut, are as messes of meat set about a grave.
<br>19	What good shall an offering do to an idol? for it can neither eat, nor smell:
<br>20	So is he that is persecuted by the Lord, bearing the reward of his iniquity:
<br>21	He seeth with his eyes, and groaneth, as an eunuch embracing a virgin, and sighing.
<br>22	Give not up thy soul to sadness, and afflict not thyself in thy own counsel.
<br>23	The joyfulness of the heart, is the life of a man, and a never failing treasure of holiness: and the joy of a man is length of life.
<br>24	Have pity on thy own soul, pleasing God, and contain thyself: gather up thy heart in his holiness: and drive away sadness far from thee.
<br>25	For sadness hath killed many, and there is no profit in it.
<br>26	Envy and anger shorten a man’s days, and pensiveness will bring old age before the time.
<br>27	A cheerful and good heart is always feast- ing: for his banquets are prepared with diligence.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 31
<br>Watching for riches consumeth the flesh, and the thought thereof driveth away sleep.
<br>2	The thinking beforehand turneth away the understanding, and a grievous sickness maketh the soul sober.
<br>3	The rich man hath laboured in gathering riches together, and when he resteth he shall be filled with his goods.
<br>4	The poor man hath laboured in his low way of life, and in the end he is still poor.
<br>5	He that loveth gold, shall not be justified: and he that followeth after corruption, shall be filled with it.
<br>6	Many have been brought to fall for gold, and the beauty thereof hath been their ruin.
<br>7	Gold is a stumblingblock to them that sac- rifice to it: woe to them that eagerly follow after it, and every fool shall perish by it.
<br>8	Blessed is the rich man that is found without blemish: and that hath not gone after gold, nor put his trust in money nor in treasures.
<br>9	Who is he, and we will praise him? for he hath done wonderful things in his life.
<br>10	Who hath been tried thereby, and made perfect, he shall have glory everlasting. He that could have transgressed, and hath not trans- gressed: and could do evil things, and hath not done them:
<br>11	Therefore are his goods established in the Lord, and all the church of the saints shall de- clare his alms.
<br>12	Art thou set at a great table? be not the first to open thy mouth upon it.
<br>13	Say not: There are many things which are upon it.
<br>14	Remember that a wicked eye is evil.
<br>15	What is created more wicked than an eye? therefore shall it weep over all the face when it
<br> 
<br>shall see.
<br>16	Stretch not out thy hand first, lest being disgraced with envy thou be put to confusion.
<br>17	Be not hasty in a feast.
<br>18	Judge of the disposition of thy neighbour by thyself.
<br>19	Use as a frugal man the things that are set before thee: lest if thou eatest much, thou be hated.
<br>20	Leave off first, for manners’ sake: and ex- ceed not, lest thou offend.
<br>21	And if thou sittest among many, reach not thy hand out first of all, and be not the first to ask for drink.
<br>22	How sufficient is a little wine for a man well taught, and in sleeping thou shalt not be uneasy with it, and thou shalt feel no pain.
<br>23	Watching, and choler, and gripes, are with an intemperate man:
<br>24	Sound and wholesome sleep with a moder- ate man: he shall sleep till morning, and his soul shall be delighted with him.
<br>25	And if thou hast been forced to eat much, arise, go out, and vomit: and it shall refresh thee, and thou shalt not bring sickness upon thy body. 26 Hear me, my son, and despise me not: and
<br>in the end thou shalt find my words.
<br>27	In all thy works be quick, and no infirmity shall come to thee.
<br>28	The lips of many shall bless him that is lib- eral of his bread, and the testimony of his truth is faithful.
<br>29	Against him that is niggardly of his bread, the city will murmur, and the testimony of his niggardliness is true.
<br>30	Challenge not them that love wine: for wine hath destroyed very many.
<br>31	Fire trieth hard iron: so wine drunk to excess shall rebuke the hearts of the proud.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>32	Wine taken with sobriety is equal life to men: if thou drink it moderately, thou shalt be sober.
<br>33	What is his life, who is diminished with wine?
<br>34	What taketh away life? death.
<br>35	Wine was created from the beginning to make men joyful, and not to make them drunk. 36 Wine drunken with moderation is the joy
<br>of the soul and the heart.
<br>37	Sober drinking is health to soul and body.
<br>38	Wine drunken with excess raiseth quarrels, and wrath, and many ruins.
<br>39	Wine drunken with excess is bitterness of the soul.
<br>40	The heat of drunkenness is the stumbling- block of the fool, lessening strength and causing wounds.
<br>41	Rebuke not thy neighbour in a banquet of wine: and despise him not in his mirth.
<br>42	Speak not to him words of reproach: and press him not in demanding again.
<br>
<br>Chapter 32
<br>Have they made thee ruler? be not lifted up: be among them as one of them.
<br>2	Have care of them, and so sit down, and when thou hast acquitted thyself of all thy charge, take thy place:
<br>3	That thou mayst rejoice for them, and re- ceive a crown as an ornament of grace, and get the honour of the contribution.
<br>4	Speak, thou that art elder: for it becometh thee,
<br>5	To speak the first word with careful knowl- edge, and hinder not music.
<br>6	Where there is no hearing, pour not out words, and be not lifted up out of season with
<br> 
<br>thy wisdom.
<br>7	A concert of music in a banquet of wine is as a carbuncle set in gold.
<br>8	As a signet of an emerald in a work of gold: so is the melody of music with pleasant and mod- erate wine.
<br>9	Hear in silence, and for thy reverence good grace shall come to thee.
<br>10	Young man, scarcely speak in thy own cause.
<br>11	If thou be asked twice, let thy answer be short.
<br>12	In many things be as if thou wert ignorant, and hear in silence and withal seeking.
<br>13	In the company of great men take not upon thee: and when the ancients are present, speak not much.
<br>14	Before a storm goeth lightning: and be- fore shamefacedness goeth favour: and for thy reverence good grace shall come to thee.
<br>15	And at the time of rising be not slack: but be first to run home to thy house, and there with- draw thyself, and there take thy pastime.
<br>16	And do what thou hast a mind, but not in sin or proud speech.
<br>17	And for all these things bless the Lord, that made thee, and that replenisheth thee with all his good things.
<br>18	He that feareth the Lord, will receive his discipline: and they that will seek him early, shall find a blessing.
<br>19	He that seeketh the law, shall be filled with it: and he that dealeth deceitfully, shall meet with a stumblingblock therein.
<br>20	They that fear the Lord, shall find just judgment, and shall kindle justice as a light.
<br>21	A sinful man will flee reproof, and will find an excuse according to his will.
<br>22	A man of counsel will not neglect un- derstanding, a strange and proud man will not
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>dread fear:
<br>23	Even after he hath done with fear without counsel, he shall be controlled by the things of his own seeking.
<br>24	My son, do thou nothing without counsel, and thou shalt not repent when thou hast done. 25 Go not in the way of ruin, and thou shalt not stumble against the stones: trust not thyself to a rugged way, lest thou set a stumblingblock
<br>to thy soul.
<br>26	And beware of thy own children, and take heed of them of thy household.
<br>27	In every work of thine regard thy soul in faith: for this is the keeping of the command- ments.
<br>28	He that believeth God, taketh heed to the commandments: and he that trusteth in him, shall fare never the worse.
<br>
<br>Chapter 33
<br>No evils shall happen to him that feareth the Lord, but in temptation God will keep him and deliver him from evils.
<br>2	A wise man hateth not the commandments and justices, and he shall not be dashed in pieces as a ship in a storm.
<br>3	A man of understanding is faithful to the law of God, and the law is faithful to him.
<br>4	He that cleareth up a question, shall pre- pare what to say, and so having prayed he shall be heard, and shall keep discipline, and then he shall answer.
<br>5	The heart of a fool is as a wheel of a cart: and his thoughts are like a rolling axletree.
<br>6	A friend that is a mocker, is like a stallion horse: he neigheth under every one that sitteth upon him.
<br>7	Why doth one day excel another, and one
<br> 
<br>light another, and one year another year, when all come of the sun?
<br>8	By the knowledge of the Lord they were dis- tinguished, the sun being made, and keeping his commandment.
<br>9	And he ordered the seasons, and holidays of them, and in them they celebrated festivals at an hour.
<br>10	Some of them God made high and great days, and some of them he put in the number of ordinary days. And all men are from the ground, and out of the earth, from whence Adam was created.
<br>11	With much knowledge the Lord hath di- vided them and diversified their ways.
<br>12	Some of them hath he blessed, and exalted: and some of them hath he sanctified, and set near himself: and some of them hath he cursed and brought low, and turned them from their station. 13 As the potter’s clay is in his hand, to fash-
<br>ion and order it:
<br>14 All his ways are according to his ordering: so man is in the hand of him that made him, and he will render to him according to his judgment. 15 Good is set against evil, and life against death: so also is the sinner against a just man. And so look upon all the works of the most High.
<br>Two and two, and one against another.
<br>16	And I awaked last of all, and as one that gathereth after the grapegatherers.
<br>17	In the blessing of God I also have hoped: and as one that gathereth grapes, have I filled the winepress.
<br>18	See that I have not laboured for myself only, but for all that seek discipline.
<br>19	Hear me, ye great men, and all ye peo- ple, and hearken with your ears, ye rulers of the church.
<br>20	Give not to son or wife, brother or friend, power over thee while thou livest; and give not
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>thy estate to another, lest thou repent, and thou entreat for the same.
<br>21	As long as thou livest, and hast breath in thee, let no man change thee.
<br>22	For it is better that thy children should ask of thee, than that thou look toward the hands of thy children.
<br>23	In all thy works keep the pre-eminence.
<br>24	Let no stain sully thy glory. In the time when thou shalt end the days of thy life, and in the time of thy decease, distribute thy inheri- tance.
<br>25	Fodder, and a wand, and a burden are for an ass: bread, and correction, and work for a slave.
<br>26	He worketh under correction, and seeketh to rest: let his hands be idle, and he seeketh liberty.
<br>27	The yoke and the thong bend a stiff neck, and continual labours bow a slave.
<br>28	Torture and fetters are for a malicious slave: send him to work, that he be not idle:
<br>29	For idleness hath taught much evil.
<br>30	Set him to work: for so it is fit for him. And if he be not obedient, bring him down with fetters, but be not excessive towards any one, and do no grievous thing without judgment.
<br>31	If thou have a faithful servant, let him be to thee as thy own soul: treat him as a brother: because in the blood of thy soul thou hast gotten him.
<br>32	If thou hurt him unjustly, he will run away: 33 And if he rise up and depart, thou knowest not whom to ask, and in what way to seek him.
<br>
<br>Chapter 34
<br>The hopes of a man that is void of understanding are vain and deceitful: and dreams lift up fools.
<br> 
<br>2	The man that giveth heed to lying visions, is like to him that catcheth at a shadow, and followeth after the wind.
<br>3	The vision of dreams is the resemblance of one thing to another: as when a man’s likeness is before the face of a man.
<br>4	What can be made clean by the unclean? and what truth can come from that which is false?
<br>5	Deceitful divinations and lying omens and the dreams of evildoers, are vanity:
<br>6	And the heart fancieth as that of a woman in travail: except it be a vision sent forth from the most High, set not thy heart upon them.
<br>7	For dreams have deceived many, and they have failed that put their trust in them.
<br>8	The word of the law shall be fulfilled without a lie, and wisdom shall be made plain in the mouth of the faithful.
<br>9	What doth he know, that hath not been tried? A man that hath much experience, shall think of many things: and he that hath learned many things, shall shew forth understanding.
<br>10	He that hath no experience, knoweth lit- tle: and he that hath been experienced in many things, multiplieth prudence.
<br>11	He that hath not been tried, what man- ner of things doth he know? he that hath been surprised, shall abound with subtlety.
<br>12	I have seen many things by travelling, and many customs of things.
<br>13	Sometimes I have been in danger of death for these things, and I have been delivered by the grace of God.
<br>14	The spirit of those that fear God, is sought after, and by his regard shall be blessed.
<br>15	For their hope is on him that saveth them, and the eyes of God are upon them that love him.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>16	He that feareth the Lord shall tremble at nothing, and shall not be afraid: for he is his hope.
<br>17	The soul of him that feareth the Lord is blessed.
<br>18	To whom doth he look, and who is his strength?
<br>19	The eyes of the Lord are upon them that fear him, he is their powerful protector, and strong stay, a defence from the heat, and a cover from the sun at noon,
<br>20	A preservation from stumbling, and a help from falling: he raiseth up the soul, and enlight- eneth the eyes, and giveth health, and life, and blessing.
<br>21	The offering of him that sacrificeth of a thing wrongfully gotten, is stained, and the mockeries of the unjust are not acceptable.
<br>22	The Lord is only for them that wait upon him in the way of truth and justice.
<br>23	The most High approveth not the gifts of the wicked: neither hath he respect to the obla- tions of the unjust, nor will he be pacified for sins by the multitude of their sacrifices.
<br>24	He that offereth sacrifice of the goods of the poor, is as one that sacrificeth the son in the presence of his father.
<br>25	The bread of the needy, is the life of the poor: he that defraudeth them thereof, is a man of blood.
<br>26	He that taketh away the bread gotten by sweat, is like him that killeth his neighbour.
<br>27	He that sheddeth blood, and he that de- fraudeth the laborer of his hire, are brothers.
<br>28	When one buildeth up, and another pulleth down: what profit have they but the labour?
<br>29	When one prayeth, and another curseth: whose voice will God hear?
<br>30	He that washeth himself after touching the dead, if he toucheth him again, what doth his
<br> 
<br>washing avail?
<br>31	So a man that fasteth for his sins, and doth the same again, what doth his humbling himself profit him? who will hear his prayer?
<br>
<br>Chapter 35
<br>
<br>He that keepeth the law, multiplieth offerings.
<br>2 It is a wholesome sacrifice to take heed to the commandments, and to depart from all iniquity. 3 And to depart from injustice, is to offer a propitiatory sacrifice for injustices, and a beg-
<br>ging of pardon for sins.
<br>4	He shall return thanks, that offereth fine flour: and he that doth mercy, offereth sacrifice.
<br>5	To depart from iniquity is that which pleaseth the Lord, and to depart from injustice, is an entreaty for sins.
<br>6	Thou shalt not appear empty in the sight of the Lord.
<br>7	For all these things are to be done because of the commandment of God.
<br>8	The oblation of the just maketh the altar fat, and is an odour of sweetness in the sight of the most High.
<br>9	The sacrifice of the just is acceptable, and the Lord will not forget the memorial thereof.
<br>10	Give glory to God with a good heart: and diminish not the firstfruits of thy hands.
<br>11	In every gift shew a cheerful countenance, and sanctify thy tithes with joy.
<br>12	Give to the most High according to what he hath given to thee, and with a good eye do according to the ability of thy hands:
<br>13	For the Lord maketh recompense, and will give thee seven times as much.
<br>14	Do not offer wicked gifts, for such he will not receive.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>15	And look not upon an unjust sacrifice, for the Lord is judge, and there is not with him re- spect of person.
<br>16	The Lord will not accept any person against a poor man, and he will hear the prayer of him that is wronged.
<br>17	He will not despise the prayers of the fa- therless: nor the widow, when she poureth out her complaint.
<br>18	Do not the widow’s tears run down the cheek, and her cry against him that causeth them to fall?
<br>19	For from the cheek they go up even to heaven, and the Lord that heareth will not be delighted with them.
<br>20	He that adoreth God with joy, shall be ac- cepted, and his prayer shall approach even to the clouds.
<br>21	The prayer of him that humbleth himself, shall pierce the clouds: and till it come nigh he will not be comforted: and he will not depart till the most High behold.
<br>22	And the Lord will not be slack, but will judge for the just, and will do judgment: and the Almighty will not have patience with them, that he may crush their back:
<br>23	And he will repay vengeance to the Gen- tiles, till he have taken away the multitude of the proud, and broken the sceptres of the unjust,
<br>24	Till he have rendered to men according to their deeds: and according to the works of Adam, and according to his presumption,
<br>25	Till he have judged the cause of his people, and he shall delight the just with his mercy.
<br>26	The mercy of God is beautiful in the time of affliction, as a cloud of rain in the time of drought.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 36
<br>
<br>Have mercy upon us, O God of all, and behold us, and shew us the light of thy mercies:
<br>2	And send thy fear upon the nations, that have not sought after thee: that they may know that there is no God beside thee, and that they may shew forth thy wonders.
<br>3	Lift up thy hand over the strange nations, that they may see thy power.
<br>4	For as thou hast been sanctified in us in their sight, so thou shalt be magnified among them in our presence,
<br>5	That they may know thee, as we also have known thee, that there is no God beside thee, O Lord.
<br>6	Renew thy signs, and work new miracles.
<br>7	Glorify thy hand, and thy right arm.
<br>8	Raise up indignation, and pour out wrath.
<br>9	Take away the adversary, and crush the en- emy.
<br>10	Hasten the time, and remember the end, that they may declare thy wonderful works.
<br>11	Let him that escapeth be consumed by the rage of the fire: and let them perish that oppress thy people.
<br>12	Crush the head of the princes of the ene- mies that say: There is no other beside us.
<br>13	Gather together all the tribes of Jacob: that they may know that there no God besides thee, and may declare thy great works: and thou shalt inherit them as from the beginning.
<br>14	Have mercy on thy people, upon whom thy name is invoked: and upon Israel, whom thou hast raised up to be thy firstborn.
<br>15	Have mercy on Jerusalem, the city which thou hast sanctified, the city of thy rest.
<br>16	Fill Sion with thy unspeakable words, and thy people with thy glory.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>17	Give testimony to them that are thy crea- tures from the beginning, and raise up the prophecies which the former prophets spoke in thy name.
<br>18	Reward them that patiently wait for thee, that thy prophets may be found faithful: and hear the prayers of thy servants,
<br>19	According to the blessing of Aaron over thy people, and direct us into the way of justice, and let all know that dwell upon the earth, that thou art God the beholder of all ages.
<br>20	The belly will devour all meat, yet one is better than another.
<br>21	The palate tasteth venison and the wise heart false speeches.
<br>22	A perverse heart will cause grief, and a man of experience will resist it.
<br>23	A woman will receive every man: yet one daughter is better than another.
<br>24	The beauty of a woman cheereth the coun- tenance of her husband, and a man desireth nothing more.
<br>25	If she have a tongue that can cure, and likewise mitigate and shew mercy: her husband is not like other men.
<br>26	He that possesseth a good wife, beginneth a possession: she is a help like to himself, and a pillar of rest.
<br>27	Where there is no hedge, the possession shall be spoiled: and where there is no wife, he mourneth that is in want.
<br>28	Who will trust him that hath no rest, and that lodgeth wheresoever the night taketh him, as a robber well appointed, that skippeth from city to city.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 37
<br>Every friend will say: I also am his friend: but there is a friend, that is only a friend in name. Is not this a grief even to death?
<br>2	But a companion and a friend shall be turned to an enemy.
<br>3	O wicked presumption, whence camest thou to cover the earth with thy malice, and deceit- fulness?
<br>4	There is a companion who rejoiceth with his friend in his joys, but in the time of trouble, he will be against him.
<br>5	There is a companion who condoleth with his friend for his belly’s sake, and he will take up a shield against the enemy.
<br>6	Forget not thy friend in thy mind, and be not unmindful of him in thy riches.
<br>7	Consult not with him that layeth a snare for thee, and hide thy counsel from them that envy thee.
<br>8	Every counsellor giveth out counsel, but there is one that is a counsellor for himself.
<br>9	Beware of a counsellor. And know before what need he hath: for he will devise to his own mind:
<br>10	Lest he thrust a stake into the ground, and say to thee:
<br>11	Thy way is good; and then stand on the other side to see what shall befall thee.
<br>12	Treat not with a man without religion con- cerning holiness, nor with an unjust man con- cerning justice, nor with a woman touching her of whom she is jealous, nor with a coward con- cerning war, nor with a merchant about traffic, nor with a buyer of selling, nor with an envious man of giving thanks,
<br>13	Nor with the ungodly of piety, nor with the dishonest of honesty, nor with the field laborer of every work,

<br>14	Nor with him that worketh by the year of the finishing of the year, nor with an idle servant of much business: give no heed to these in any matter of counsel.
<br>15	But be continually with a holy man, whom- soever thou shalt know to observe the fear of God,
<br>16	Whose soul is according to thy own soul: and who, when thou shalt stumble in the dark, will be sorry for thee.
<br>17	And establish within thyself a heart of good counsel: for there is no other thing of more worth to thee than it.
<br>18	The soul of a holy man discovereth some- times true things, more than seven watchmen that sit in a high place to watch.
<br>19	But above all these things pray to the most High, that he may direct thy way in truth.
<br>20	In all thy works let the true word go before thee, and steady counsel before every action.
<br>21	A wicked word shall change the heart: out of which four manner of things arise, good and evil, life and death: and the tongue is continually the ruler of them. There is a man that is subtle and a teacher of many, and yet is unprofitable to his own soul.
<br>22	A skilful man hath taught many, and is sweet to his own soul.
<br>23	He that speaketh sophistically, is hateful: he shall be destitute of every thing.
<br>24	Grace is not given him from the Lord: for he is deprived of all wisdom.
<br>25	There is a wise man that is wise to his own soul: and the fruit of his understanding is commendable.
<br>26	A wise man instructeth his own people, and the fruits of his understanding are faithful.
<br>27	A wise man shall be filled with blessings, and they that see shall praise him.
<br> 
<br>28	The life of a man is in the number of his days: but the days of Israel are innumerable.
<br>29	A wise man shall inherit honour among his people, and his name shall live for ever.
<br>30	My son, prove thy soul in thy life: and if it be wicked, give it no power:
<br>31	For all things are not expedient for all, and every kind pleaseth not every soul.
<br>32	Be not greedy in any feasting, and pour not out thyself upon any meat:
<br>33	For in many meats there will be sickness, and greediness will turn to choler.
<br>34	By surfeiting many have perished, but he that is temperate, shall prolong life.
<br>
<br>Chapter 38
<br>Honour the physician for the need thou hast of him: for the most High hath created him.
<br>2	For all healing is from God, and he shall receive gifts of the king.
<br>3	The skill of the physician shall lift up his head, and in the sight of great men he shall be praised.
<br>4	The most High hath created medicines out of the earth, and a wise man will not abhor them. 5 Was not bitter water made sweet with wood?
<br>6	The virtue of these things is come to the knowledge of men, and the most High hath given knowledge to men, that he may be honoured in his wonders.
<br>7	By these he shall cure and shall allay their pains, and of these the apothecary shall make sweet confections, and shall make up ointments of health, and of his works there shall be no end. 8 For the peace of God is over all the face of
<br>the earth.
<br>9	My son, in thy sickness neglect not thyself, but pray to the Lord, and he shall heal thee.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>10	Turn away from sin and order thy hands aright, and cleanse thy heart from all offence.
<br>11	Give a sweet savour, and a memorial of fine flour, and make a fat offering, and then give place to the physician.
<br>12	For the Lord created him: and let him not depart from thee, for his works are necessary.
<br>13	For there is a time when thou must fall into their hands:
<br>14	And they shall beseech the Lord, that he would prosper what they give for ease and rem- edy, for their conversation.
<br>15	He that sinneth in the sight of his Maker, shall fall into the hands of the physician.
<br>16	My son, shed tears over the dead, and begin to lament as if thou hadst suffered some great harm, and according to judgment cover his body, and neglect not his burial.
<br>17	And for fear of being ill spoken of weep bitterly for a day, and then comfort thyself in thy sadness.
<br>18	And make mourning for him according to his merit for a day, or two, for fear of detraction. 19 For of sadness cometh death, and it over- whelmeth the strength, and the sorrow of the
<br>heart boweth down the neck.
<br>20	In withdrawing aside sorrow remaineth: and the substance of the poor is according to his heart.
<br>21	Give not up thy heart to sadness, but drive it from thee: and remember the latter end.
<br>22	Forget it not: for there is no returning, and thou shalt do him no good, and shalt hurt thyself.
<br>23	Remember my judgment: for thine also shall be so: yesterday for me, and to day for thee.
<br>24	When the dead is at rest, let his remem- brance rest, and comfort him in the departing of his spirit.
<br> 
<br>25	The wisdom of a scribe cometh by his time of leisure: and he that is less in action, shall receive wisdom.
<br>26	With what wisdom shall he be furnished that holdeth the plough, and that glorieth in the goad, that driveth the oxen therewith, and is occupied in their labours, and his whole talk is about the offspring of bulls?
<br>27	He shall give his mind to turn up furrows, and his care is to give the kine fodder.
<br>28	So every craftsman and workmaster that laboureth night and day, he who maketh graven seals, and by his continual diligence varieth the figure: he shall give his mind to the resemblance of the picture, and by his watching shall finish the work.
<br>29	So doth the smith sitting by the anvil and considering the iron work. The vapour of the fire wasteth his flesh, and he fighteth with the heat of the furnace.
<br>30	The noise of the hammer is always in his ears, and his eye is upon the pattern of the vessel he maketh.
<br>31	He setteth his mind to finish his work, and his watching to polish them to perfection.
<br>32	So doth the potter sitting at his work, turn- ing the wheel about with his feet, who is always carefully set to his work, and maketh all his work by number:
<br>33	He fashioneth the clay with his arm, and boweth down his strength before his feet:
<br>34	He shall give his mind to finish the glazing, and his watching to make clean the furnace.
<br>35	All these trust to their hands, and every one is wise in his own art.
<br>36	Without these a city is not built.
<br>37	And they shall not dwell, nor walk about therein, and they shall not go up into the assem- bly.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>38	Upon the judges’ seat they shall not sit, and the ordinance of judgment they shall not understand, neither shall they declare discipline and judgment, and they shall not be found where parables are spoken:
<br>39	But they shall strengthen the state of the world, and their prayer shall be in the work of their craft, applying their soul, and searching in the law of the most High.
