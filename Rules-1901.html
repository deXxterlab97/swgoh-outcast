<br>§3732. Procedure on default
<br>
<br>(a)(1) In the event of default in the payment of any loan guaranteed under this chapter, the holder of the obligation shall notify the Secretary of such default. Upon receipt of such notice, the Secretary may, subject to subsection (c) of this section, pay to such holder the guaranty not in excess of the pro rata portion of the amount originally guaranteed. Except as provided in section 3703(e) of this title, if the Secretary makes such a payment, the Secretary shall be subrogated to the rights of the holder of the obligation to the extent of the amount paid on the guaranty.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) Before suit or foreclosure the holder of the obligation shall notify the Secretary of the default, and within thirty days thereafter the Secretary may, at the Secretary's option, pay the holder of the obligation the unpaid balance of the obligation plus accrued interest and receive an assignment of the loan and security. Nothing in this section shall preclude any forebearance for the benefit of the veteran as may be agreed upon by the parties to the loan and approved by the Secretary.
<br>
<br>(B) In the event that a housing loan guaranteed under this chapter is modified under the authority provided under section 1322(b) of title 11, the Secretary may pay the holder of the obligation the unpaid principal balance of the obligation due, plus accrued interest, as of the date of the filing of the petition under title 11, but only upon the assignment, transfer, and delivery to the Secretary (in a form and manner satisfactory to the Secretary) of all rights, interest, claims, evidence, and records with respect to the housing loan.
<br>
<br>(3) The Secretary may establish the date, not later than the date of judgment and decree of foreclosure or sale, upon which accrual of interest or charges shall cease.
<br>
<br>(4)(A) Upon receiving a notice pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Secretary shall—
<br>
<br>(i) provide the veteran with information and, to the extent feasible, counseling regarding—
<br>
<br>(I) alternatives to foreclosure, as appropriate in light of the veteran's particular circumstances, including possible methods of curing the default, conveyance of the property to the Secretary by means of a deed in lieu of foreclosure, and the actions authorized by paragraph (2) of this subsection; and
<br>
<br>(II) what the Department of Veterans Affairs' and the veteran's liabilities would be with respect to the loan in the event of foreclosure; and
<br>
<br>(ii) advise the veteran regarding the availability of such counseling;
<br>
<br>except with respect to loans made by a lender which the Secretary has determined has a demonstrated record of consistently providing timely and accurate information to veterans with respect to such matters.
<br>
<br>(B) The Secretary shall, to the extent of the availability of appropriations, ensure that sufficient personnel are available to administer subparagraph (A) of this paragraph effectively and efficiently.
<br>
<br>(5) In the event of default in the payment of any loan guaranteed or insured under this chapter in which a partial payment has been tendered by the veteran concerned and refused by the holder, the holder of the obligation shall notify the Secretary as soon as such payment has been refused. The Secretary may require that any such notification include a statement of the circumstances of the default, the amount tendered, the amount of the indebtedness on the date of the tender, and the reasons for the holder's refusal.
<br>
<br>(b) With respect to any loan made under section 3711 which has not been sold as provided in subsection (g) of such section, if the Secretary finds, after there has been a default in the payment of any installment of principal or interest owing on such loan, that the default was due to the fact that the veteran who is obligated under the loan has become unemployed as the result of the closing (in whole or in part) of a Federal installation, the Secretary shall (1) extend the time for curing the default to such time as the Secretary determines is necessary and desirable to enable such veteran to complete payments on such loan, including an extension of time beyond the stated maturity thereof, or (2) modify the terms of such loan for the purpose of changing the amortization provisions thereof by recasting, over the remaining term of the loan, or over such longer period as the Secretary may determine, the total unpaid amount then due with the modification to become effective currently or upon the termination of an agreed-upon extension of the period for curing the default.
<br>
<br>(c)(1) For purposes of this subsection—
<br>
<br>(A) The term "defaulted loan" means a loan that is guaranteed under this chapter, that was made for a purpose described in section 3710(a) of this title, and that is in default.
<br>
<br>(B) The term "liquidation sale" means a judicial sale or other disposition of real property to liquidate a defaulted loan that is secured by such property.
<br>
<br>(C) The term "net value", with respect to real property, means the amount equal to (i) the fair market value of the property, minus (ii) the total of the amounts which the Secretary estimates the Secretary would incur (if the Secretary were to acquire and dispose of the property) for property taxes, assessments, liens, property maintenance, property improvement, administration, resale (including losses sustained on the resale of the property), and other costs resulting from the acquisition and disposition of the property, excluding any amount attributed to the cost to the Government of borrowing funds.
<br>
<br>(D) Except as provided in subparagraph (D) of paragraph (10) of this subsection, the term "total indebtedness", with respect to a defaulted loan, means the amount equal to the total of (i) the unpaid principal of the loan, (ii) the interest on the loan as of the date applicable under paragraph (10) of this subsection, and (iii) such reasonably necessary and proper charges (as specified in the loan instrument and permitted by regulations prescribed by the Secretary to implement this subsection) associated with liquidation of the loan, including advances for taxes, insurance, and maintenance or repair of the real property securing the loan.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, this subsection applies to any case in which the holder of a defaulted loan undertakes to liquidate the loan by means of a liquidation sale.
<br>
<br>(B) This subsection does not apply to a case in which the Secretary proceeds under subsection (a)(2) of this section.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) Before carrying out a liquidation sale of real property securing a defaulted loan, the holder of the loan shall notify the Secretary of the proposed sale. Such notice shall be provided in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary to implement this subsection.
<br>
<br>(B) After receiving a notice described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Secretary shall determine the net value of the property securing the loan and the amount of the total indebtedness under the loan and shall notify the holder of the loan of the determination of such net value.
<br>
<br>(4) A case referred to in paragraphs (5), (6), and (7) of this subsection as being described in this paragraph is a case in which the net value of the property securing a defaulted loan exceeds the amount of the total indebtedness under the loan minus the amount guaranteed under this chapter.
<br>
<br>(5) In a case described in paragraph (4) of this subsection, if the holder of the defaulted loan acquires the property securing the loan at a liquidation sale for an amount that does not exceed the lesser of the net value of the property or the total indebtedness under the loan—
<br>
<br>(A) the holder shall have the option to convey the property to the United States in return for payment by the Secretary of an amount equal to the lesser of such net value or total indebtedness; and

<br>§3742. Small business loan program
<br>
<br>(a)(1) Subject to subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary may provide financial assistance to veterans' small business concerns for the purpose of (A) financing plant construction, conversion, or expansion (including the acquisition of land), (B) financing the acquisition of equipment, facilities, machinery, supplies, or materials, or (C) supplying such concerns with working capital.
<br>
<br>(2) Subject to paragraph (3)(A) of this subsection, financial assistance under this section may be provided in the form of (A) loan guaranties, or (B) direct loans.
<br>
<br>(3) The Secretary shall specify in regulations the criteria to be met for a business concern to qualify as a veterans' small business concern for the purposes of this subchapter. Such regulations shall include requirements—
<br>
<br>(A) that at least 51 percent of a business concern must be owned by individuals who are veterans of the Vietnam era or disabled veterans in order for such concern to qualify for a loan guaranty and that at least 51 percent of a business concern must be owned by disabled veterans in order for such concern to qualify for a direct loan; and
<br>
<br>(B) that the management and daily business operations of the concern must be directed by one or more of the veterans whose ownership interest is part of the majority ownership for the purposes of meeting the requirement in clause (A) of this paragraph.
<br>
<br>(b) The availability of financial assistance under subsection (a) of this section is subject to the following limitations:
<br>
<br>(1) The Secretary may not make a direct loan under this section unless the veterans' small business concern applying for the loan shows to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the concern is unable to obtain a loan guaranteed by the Department under this section or made or guaranteed by the Small Business Administration.
<br>
<br>(2) The Secretary may not guarantee a loan under this section if the loan bears a rate of interest in excess of the maximum rate of interest prescribed under section 3745 of this title.
<br>
<br>(3) The Secretary may not make or guarantee a loan under this section for an amount in excess of $200,000.
<br>
<br>(4) The original liability of the Secretary on any loan guaranteed under this section may not exceed 90 percent of the amount of the loan, and such liability shall decrease or increase pro rata with any decrease or increase of the amount of the unpaid portion of the loan, but such liability may not exceed the amount of the original guaranty.
<br>
<br>(c) Each loan made or guaranteed under this subchapter shall be of such sound value, taking into account the creditworthiness of the veterans' small business concern (and the individual owners) applying for such loan, or so secured as reasonably to assure payment.
<br>
<br>(d)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Secretary may not make or guarantee a loan under this subchapter to a veterans' small business concern in which an ownership interest is held by a veteran who also has an ownership interest in another small business concern if such ownership interest was considered in qualifying that other concern for an outstanding loan made or guaranteed under this subchapter or the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 631 et seq.).
<br>
<br>(2) Paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not apply if 51 percent or more of the business concern seeking a direct or guaranteed loan under this subchapter is owned by veterans of the Vietnam era or disabled veterans without including the ownership interest of the veteran whose ownership interest in another small business concern was previously considered in qualifying that other concern for an outstanding guaranteed or direct business loan under this subchapter or the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 631 et seq.).
<br>
<br>(e)(1) In order to protect the interest of the United States, upon application by a veterans' small business concern which is the recipient of a loan guaranteed under this subchapter, the Secretary (subject to the provisions of this subsection) may undertake the veterans' small business concern's obligation to make payments under such loan or, if the loan was a direct loan made by the Secretary, may suspend such obligation. While such payments are being made by the Secretary pursuant to the undertaking of such obligation or while such obligation is suspended, no such payment with respect to the loan may be required from the concern.
<br>
<br>(2) The Secretary may undertake or suspend a veterans' small business concern's obligation under this subsection only if—
<br>
<br>(A) such undertaking or suspension of the obligation is, in the judgment of the Secretary, necessary to protect the interest of the United States;
<br>
<br>(B) with the undertaking or suspension of the obligation, the small business concern would, in the judgment of the Secretary, become or remain a viable small business entity; and
<br>
<br>(C) the small business concern executes an agreement in writing satisfactory to the Secretary as provided by paragraph (4) of this subsection.
<br>
<br>(3) The period of time for which the Secretary undertakes or suspends the obligation on a loan under this subsection may not exceed five years. The Secretary may extend the maturity of any loan on which the Secretary undertakes or suspends the obligation under this subsection for a corresponding period of time.
<br>
<br>(4)(A) Before the Secretary may undertake or suspend a veterans' small business concern's obligation under this subsection, the Secretary shall require the small business concern to execute an agreement to repay the aggregate amount of the payments which were required under the loan during the period for which the obligation was undertaken or suspended—
<br>
<br>(i) by periodic payments not less in amount or less frequently falling due than those which were due under the loan during such period,
<br>
<br>(ii) pursuant to a repayment schedule agreed upon by the Secretary and the small business concern, or
<br>
<br>(iii) by a combination of the method of payments described in clauses (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph.
<br>
<br>(B) In addition to requiring the small business concern to execute the agreement described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Secretary shall, before the undertaking or suspension of the obligation, take such action and require the small business concern to take such action as the Secretary considers appropriate in the circumstances, including the provision of such security as the Secretary considers necessary or appropriate, to assure that the rights and interest of the United States and any lender will be safeguarded adequately during and after the period in which such obligation is so undertaken or suspended.

<br>(2) the memorandum is in effect when the loan is made.
<br>
<br>(b)(1) Subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary shall ensure that each memorandum of understanding that the Secretary enters into with a tribal organization shall provide for the following:
<br>
<br>(A) That each Native American veteran who is under the jurisdiction of the tribal organization and to whom the Secretary makes a direct loan under this subchapter—
<br>
<br>(i) holds, possesses, or purchases using the proceeds of the loan a meaningful interest in a lot or dwelling (or both) that is located on trust land; and
<br>
<br>(ii) will purchase, construct, or improve (as the case may be) a dwelling on the lot using the proceeds of the loan.
<br>
<br>(B) That each such Native American veteran will convey to the Secretary by an appropriate instrument the interest referred to in subparagraph (A) as security for a direct housing loan under this subchapter.
<br>
<br>(C) That the tribal organization and each such Native American veteran will permit the Secretary to enter upon the trust land of that organization or veteran for the purposes of carrying out such actions as the Secretary determines are necessary—

<br>(i) to evaluate the advisability of the loan; and
<br>
<br>(ii) to monitor any purchase, construction, or improvements carried out using the proceeds of the loan.
<br>
<br>(D) That the tribal organization has established standards and procedures that apply to the foreclosure of the interest conveyed by a Native American veteran pursuant to subparagraph (B), including—
<br>
<br>(i) procedures for foreclosing the interest; and
<br>
<br>(ii) procedures for the resale of the lot or the dwelling (or both) purchased, constructed, or improved using the proceeds of the loan.
<br>
<br>(E) That the tribal organization agrees to such other terms and conditions with respect to the making of direct loans to Native American veterans under the jurisdiction of the tribal organization as the Secretary may require in order to ensure that loans under this subchapter are made in a responsible and prudent manner.
<br>
<br>(2) The Secretary may not enter into a memorandum of understanding with a tribal organization under this subsection unless the Secretary determines that the memorandum provides for such standards and procedures as are necessary for the reasonable protection of the financial interests of the United States.
<br>
<br>(c)(1) Loans made under this section shall bear interest at a rate determined by the Secretary, which rate may not exceed the appropriate rate authorized for guaranteed loans under section 3703(c)(1) or section 3712(f) of this title, and shall be subject to such requirements or limitations prescribed for loans guaranteed under this title as the Secretary may prescribe.
<br>
<br>(2) Notwithstanding section 3704(a) of this title, the Secretary shall establish minimum requirements for planning, construction, improvement, and general acceptability relating to any direct loan made under this section.
<br>
<br>(d)(1) The Secretary shall establish credit underwriting standards to be used in evaluating loans made under this subchapter. In establishing such standards, the Secretary shall take into account the purpose of this program to make available housing to Native American veterans living on trust lands.
<br>
<br>(2) The Secretary shall determine the reasonable value of the interest in property that will serve as security for a loan made under this section and shall establish procedures for appraisals upon which the Secretary may base such determinations. The procedures shall incorporate generally the relevant requirements of section 3731 of this title, unless the Secretary determines that such requirements are impracticable to implement in a geographic area, on particular trust lands, or under circumstances specified by the Secretary.
