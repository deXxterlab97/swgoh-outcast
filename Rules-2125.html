<br>(16) Special auction provisions for eligible frequencies
<br>(A) Special regulations
<br>
<br>The Commission shall revise the regulations prescribed under paragraph (4)(F) of this subsection to prescribe methods by which the total cash proceeds from any auction of eligible frequencies described in section 113(g)(2) of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act (47 U.S.C. 923(g)(2)) shall at least equal 110 percent of the total estimated relocation or sharing costs provided to the Commission pursuant to section 113(g)(4) of such Act.
<br>(B) Conclusion of auctions contingent on minimum proceeds
<br>
<br>The Commission shall not conclude any auction of eligible frequencies described in section 113(g)(2) of such Act [47 U.S.C. 923(g)(2)] if the total cash proceeds attributable to such spectrum are less than 110 percent of the total estimated relocation or sharing costs provided to the Commission pursuant to section 113(g)(4) of such Act. If the Commission is unable to conclude an auction for the foregoing reason, the Commission shall cancel the auction, return within 45 days after the auction cancellation date any deposits from participating bidders held in escrow, and absolve such bidders from any obligation to the United States to bid in any subsequent reauction of such spectrum.
<br>(C) Authority to issue prior to deauthorization
<br>
<br>In any auction conducted under the regulations required by subparagraph (A), the Commission may grant a license assigned for the use of eligible frequencies prior to the termination of an eligible Federal entity's authorization. However, the Commission shall condition such license by requiring that the licensee cannot cause harmful interference to such Federal entity until such entity's authorization has been terminated by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration.
<br>(17) Certain conditions on auction participation prohibited
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Commission may not prevent a person from participating in a system of competitive bidding under this subsection if such person—
<br>
<br>(i) complies with all the auction procedures and other requirements to protect the auction process established by the Commission; and
<br>
<br>(ii) either—
<br>
<br>(I) meets the technical, financial, character, and citizenship qualifications that the Commission may require under section 303(l)(1), 308(b), or 310 of this title to hold a license; or
<br>
<br>(II) would meet such license qualifications by means approved by the Commission prior to the grant of the license.
<br>(B) Clarification of authority
<br>
<br>Nothing in subparagraph (A) affects any authority the Commission has to adopt and enforce rules of general applicability, including rules concerning spectrum aggregation that promote competition.
<br>(18) Estimate of upcoming auctions
<br>
<br>(A) Not later than September 30, 2018, and annually thereafter, the Commission shall make publicly available an estimate of what systems of competitive bidding authorized under this subsection may be initiated during the upcoming 12-month period.
<br>
<br>(B) The estimate under subparagraph (A) shall, to the extent possible, identify the bands of frequencies the Commission expects to be included in each such system of competitive bidding.
<br>(k) Broadcast station renewal procedures
<br>(1) Standards for renewal
<br>
<br>If the licensee of a broadcast station submits an application to the Commission for renewal of such license, the Commission shall grant the application if it finds, with respect to that station, during the preceding term of its license—
<br>
<br>(A) the station has served the public interest, convenience, and necessity;
<br>
<br>(B) there have been no serious violations by the licensee of this chapter or the rules and regulations of the Commission; and
<br>
<br>(C) there have been no other violations by the licensee of this chapter or the rules and regulations of the Commission which, taken together, would constitute a pattern of abuse.
<br>(2) Consequence of failure to meet standard
<br>
<br>If any licensee of a broadcast station fails to meet the requirements of this subsection, the Commission may deny the application for renewal in accordance with paragraph (3), or grant such application on terms and conditions as are appropriate, including renewal for a term less than the maximum otherwise permitted.
<br>(3) Standards for denial
<br>
<br>If the Commission determines, after notice and opportunity for a hearing as provided in subsection (e), that a licensee has failed to meet the requirements specified in paragraph (1) and that no mitigating factors justify the imposition of lesser sanctions, the Commission shall—
<br>
<br>(A) issue an order denying the renewal application filed by such licensee under section 308 of this title; and
<br>
<br>(B) only thereafter accept and consider such applications for a construction permit as may be filed under section 308 of this title specifying the channel or broadcasting facilities of the former licensee.
<br>(4) Competitor consideration prohibited
<br>
<br>In making the determinations specified in paragraph (1) or (2), the Commission shall not consider whether the public interest, convenience, and necessity might be served by the grant of a license to a person other than the renewal applicant.
<br>(l) Applicability of competitive bidding to pending comparative licensing cases
<br>
<br>With respect to competing applications for initial licenses or construction permits for commercial radio or television stations that were filed with the Commission before July 1, 1997, the Commission shall—
<br>
<br>(1) have the authority to conduct a competitive bidding proceeding pursuant to subsection (j) to assign such license or permit;
<br>
<br>(2) treat the persons filing such applications as the only persons eligible to be qualified bidders for purposes of such proceeding; and
<br>
<br>(3) waive any provisions of its regulations necessary to permit such persons to enter an agreement to procure the removal of a conflict between their applications during the 180-day period beginning on August 5, 1997.

<br>"(c) Criteria for Strategic Technology Reserves.—
<br>
<br>"(1) In general.—In evaluating permitted uses under subparagraph (a)(1)(B), the Assistant Secretary shall consider the continuing technological evolution of communications technologies and devices, with its implicit risk of obsolescence, and shall ensure, to the maximum extent feasible, that a substantial part of the reserve involves prenegotiated contracts and other arrangements for rapid deployment of equipment, supplies, and systems (and communications service related to such equipment, supplies, and systems), rather than the warehousing or storage of equipment and supplies currently available at the time the reserve is established.
<br>
<br>"(2) Requirements and characteristics.—Funds provided to meet uses described in paragraph (1) shall be used in support of reserves that—
<br>
<br>"(A) are capable of re-establishing communications when existing critical infrastructure is damaged or destroyed in an emergency or a major disaster;
<br>
<br>"(B) include appropriate current, widely-used equipment, such as Land Mobile Radio Systems, cellular telephones and satellite-enabled equipment (and related communications service), Cells-On-Wheels, Cells-On-Light-Trucks, or other self-contained mobile cell sites that can be towed, backup batteries, generators, fuel, and computers;
<br>
<br>"(C) include equipment on hand for the Governor of each State, key emergency response officials, and appropriate State or local personnel;
<br>
<br>"(D) include contracts (including prenegotiated contracts) for rapid delivery of the most current technology available from commercial sources; and

<br>
<br>[Pub. L. 111–4, §3(d), Feb. 11, 2009, 123 Stat. 113, provided that: "The amendments made by this section [amending section 3005(c)(1) of Pub.

<br>Findings
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 107–195, §2, June 19, 2002, 116 Stat. 715, provided that: "Congress finds the following:
<br>
<br>"(1) Circumstances in the telecommunications market have changed dramatically since the auctioning of spectrum in the 700 megahertz band was originally mandated by Congress in 1997, raising serious questions as to whether the original deadlines, or the subsequent revision of the deadlines, are consistent with sound telecommunications policy and spectrum management principles.
<br>
<br>"(2) No comprehensive plan yet exists for allocating additional spectrum for third-generation wireless and other advanced communications services. The Federal Communications Commission should have the flexibility to auction frequencies in the 700 megahertz band for such purposes.
<br>
<br>"(3) The study being conducted by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration in consultation with the Department of Defense to determine whether the Department of Defense can share or relinquish additional spectrum for third generation wireless and other advanced communications services will not be completed until after the June 19th auction date for the upper 700 megahertz band, and long after the applications must be filed to participate in the auction, thereby creating further uncertainty as to whether the frequencies in the 700 megahertz band will be put to their highest and best use for the benefit of consumers.
<br>
<br>"(4) The Federal Communications Commission is also in the process of determining how to resolve the interference problems that exist in the 800 megahertz band, especially for public safety. One option being considered for the 800 megahertz band would involve the 700 megahertz band. The Commission should not hold the 700 megahertz auction before the 800 megahertz interference issues are resolved or a tenable plan has been conceived.
<br>
<br>"(5) The 700 megahertz band is currently occupied by television broadcasters, and will be so until the transfer to digital television is completed. This situation creates a tremendous amount of uncertainty concerning when the spectrum will be available and reduces the value placed on the spectrum by potential bidders. The encumbrance of the 700 megahertz band reduces both the amount of money that the auction would be likely to produce and the probability that the spectrum would be purchased by the entities that valued the spectrum the most and would put the spectrum to its most productive use.
<br>
<br>"(6) The Commission's rules governing voluntary mechanisms for vacating the 700 megahertz band by broadcast stations—
<br>
<br>"(A) produced no certainty that the band would be available for advanced mobile communications services, public safety operations, or other wireless services any earlier than the existing statutory framework provides; and
<br>
<br>"(B) should advance the transition of digital television and must not result in the unjust enrichment of any incumbent licensee."
<br>Compliance With Auction Authority
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 107–195, §4, June 19, 2002, 116 Stat. 717, provided that: "The Federal Communications Commission shall conduct rescheduled auctions 31 and 44 prior to the expiration of the auction authority under section 309(j)(11) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 309(j)(11))."
<br>Preservation of Broadcaster Obligations
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 107–195, §5, June 19, 2002, 116 Stat. 717, provided that: "Nothing in this Act [see Short Title of 2002 Amendment note set out under section 609 of this title] shall be construed to relieve television broadcast station licensees of the obligation to complete the digital television service conversion as required by section 309(j)(14) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 309(j)(14))."
