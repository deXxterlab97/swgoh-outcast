<br>"Consumers Have the Right To Obtain a Security Freeze
<br>
<br>"You have a right to place a 'security freeze' on your credit report, which will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing information in your credit report without your express authorization. The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit.
<br>
<br>"As an alternative to a security freeze, you have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on your credit file at no cost. An initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer's credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer's credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer's identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting 7 years.
<br>
<br>"A security freeze does not apply to a person or entity, or its affiliates, or collection agencies acting on behalf of the person or entity, with which you have an existing account that requests information in your credit report for the purposes of reviewing or collecting the account. Reviewing the account includes activities related to account maintenance, monitoring, credit line increases, and account upgrades and enhancements.".

<br>(iii) allows a consumer to request an extended fraud alert;

<br>(vi) shall not be the only mechanism by which a consumer may request a security freeze.

<br>§1681c–2. Block of information resulting from identity theft
<br>(a) Block
<br>
<br>Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of—
<br>
<br>(1) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer;
<br>
<br>(2) a copy of an identity theft report;
<br>
<br>(3) the identification of such information by the consumer; and
<br>
<br>(4) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer.
<br>(b) Notification
<br>
<br>A consumer reporting agency shall promptly notify the furnisher of information identified by the consumer under subsection (a)—
<br>
<br>(1) that the information may be a result of identity theft;
<br>
<br>(2) that an identity theft report has been filed;
<br>
<br>(3) that a block has been requested under this section; and
<br>
<br>(4) of the effective dates of the block.
<br>(c) Authority to decline or rescind
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>A consumer reporting agency may decline to block, or may rescind any block, of information relating to a consumer under this section, if the consumer reporting agency reasonably determines that—
<br>
<br>(A) the information was blocked in error or a block was requested by the consumer in error;
<br>
<br>(B) the information was blocked, or a block was requested by the consumer, on the basis of a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer relevant to the request to block; or
<br>
<br>(C) the consumer obtained possession of goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions.
<br>(2) Notification to consumer
<br>
<br>If a block of information is declined or rescinded under this subsection, the affected consumer shall be notified promptly, in the same manner as consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information under section 1681i(a)(5)(B) of this title.
<br>(3) Significance of block
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block.
<br>(d) Exception for resellers
<br>(1) No reseller file
<br>
<br>This section shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency, if the consumer reporting agency—
<br>
<br>(A) is a reseller;
<br>
<br>(B) is not, at the time of the request of the consumer under subsection (a), otherwise furnishing or reselling a consumer report concerning the information identified by the consumer; and
<br>
<br>(C) informs the consumer, by any means, that the consumer may report the identity theft to the Bureau to obtain consumer information regarding identity theft.
<br>(2) Reseller with file
<br>
<br>The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if—
<br>
<br>(A) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a), identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft; and
<br>
<br>(B) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information.
<br>(3) Notice
<br>
<br>In carrying out its obligation under paragraph (2), the reseller shall promptly provide a notice to the consumer of the decision to block the file. Such notice shall contain the name, address, and telephone number of each consumer reporting agency from which the consumer information was obtained for resale.
<br>(e) Exception for verification companies
<br>
<br>The provisions of this section do not apply to a check services company, acting as such, which issues authorizations for the purpose of approving or processing negotiable instruments, electronic fund transfers, or similar methods of payments, except that, beginning 4 business days after receipt of information described in paragraphs (1) through (3) of subsection (a), a check services company shall not report to a national consumer reporting agency described in section 1681a(p) of this title, any information identified in the subject identity theft report as resulting from identity theft.
<br>(f) Access to blocked information by law enforcement agencies
<br>
<br>No provision of this section shall be construed as requiring a consumer reporting agency to prevent a Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency from accessing blocked information in a consumer file to which the agency could otherwise obtain access under this subchapter.

<br>(c) Limitation on liability upon showing of reasonable procedures for compliance with provisions

<br>Every consumer reporting agency shall maintain reasonable procedures designed to avoid violations of section 1681c of this title and to limit the furnishing of consumer reports to the purposes listed under section 1681b of this title. These procedures shall require that prospective users of the information identify themselves, certify the purposes for which the information is sought, and certify that the information will be used for no other purpose. Every consumer reporting agency shall make a reasonable effort to verify the identity of a new prospective user and the uses certified by such prospective user prior to furnishing such user a consumer report.

<br>
<br>Whenever a consumer reporting agency prepares a consumer report it shall follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates.
<br>(c) Disclosure of consumer reports by users allowed

<br>
<br>a notice of such person's responsibilities under this subchapter.
<br>(2) Content of notice
<br>
<br>The Bureau shall prescribe the content of notices under paragraph (1), and a consumer reporting agency shall be in compliance with this subsection if it provides a notice under paragraph (1) that is substantially similar to the Bureau prescription under this paragraph.
<br>(e) Procurement of consumer report for resale
<br>(1) Disclosure
<br>
<br>A person may not procure a consumer report for purposes of reselling the report (or any information in the report) unless the person discloses to the consumer reporting agency that originally furnishes the report—
<br>

<br>
<br>Notwithstanding paragraph (1) or (2), a person who procures a consumer report for purposes of reselling the report (or any information in the report) shall not disclose the identity of the end-user of the report under paragraph (1) or (2) if—
<br>
<br>(A) the end user is an agency or department of the United States Government which procures the report from the person for purposes of determining the eligibility of the consumer concerned to receive access or continued access to classified information (as defined in section 1681b(b)(4)(E)(i) 1 of this title); and
<br>
<br>(B) the agency or department certifies in writing to the person reselling the report that nondisclosure is necessary to protect classified information or the safety of persons employed by or contracting with, or undergoing investigation for work or contracting with the agency or department.

<br>(3) Procedures
<br>
<br>The request of a victim under paragraph (1) shall—
<br>

<br>
<br>(B) be mailed to an address specified by the business entity, if any; and
<br>

<br>
<br>(A) the business entity has made a reasonably diligent search of its available business records; and
<br>
<br>(B) the records requested under this subsection do not exist or are not reasonably available.
<br>(11) Definition of victim
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subsection, the term "victim" means a consumer whose means of identification or financial information has been used or transferred (or has been alleged to have been used or transferred) without the authority of that consumer, with the intent to commit, or to aid or abet, an identity theft or a similar crime.

<br>(f) Disclosure of credit scores
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Upon the request of a consumer for a credit score, a consumer reporting agency shall supply to the consumer a statement indicating that the information and credit scoring model may be different than the credit score that may be used by the lender, and a notice which shall include—
<br>
<br>(A) the current credit score of the consumer or the most recent credit score of the consumer that was previously calculated by the credit reporting agency for a purpose related to the extension of credit;
<br>
<br>(B) the range of possible credit scores under the model used;

<br>(C) all of the key factors that adversely affected the credit score of the consumer in the model used, the total number of which shall not exceed 4, subject to paragraph (9);
<br>
<br>(D) the date on which the credit score was created; and
<br>
<br>(E) the name of the person or entity that provided the credit score or credit file upon which the credit score was created.
<br>(2) Definitions
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subsection, the following definitions shall apply:
<br>(A) Credit score
<br>
<br>The term "credit score"—
<br>
<br>(i) means a numerical value or a categorization derived from a statistical tool or modeling system used by a person who makes or arranges a loan to predict the likelihood of certain credit behaviors, including default (and the numerical value or the categorization derived from such analysis may also be referred to as a "risk predictor" or "risk score"); and
<br>
<br>(ii) does not include—
<br>
<br>(I) any mortgage score or rating of an automated underwriting system that considers one or more factors in addition to credit information, including the loan to value ratio, the amount of down payment, or the financial assets of a consumer; or
<br>
<br>(II) any other elements of the underwriting process or underwriting decision.
<br>(B) Key factors
<br>
<br>The term "key factors" means all relevant elements or reasons adversely affecting the credit score for the particular individual, listed in the order of their importance based on their effect on the credit score.
<br>(3) Timeframe and manner of disclosure
<br>
<br>The information required by this subsection shall be provided in the same timeframe and manner as the information described in subsection (a).
<br>(4) Applicability to certain uses
<br>
<br>This subsection shall not be construed so as to compel a consumer reporting agency to develop or disclose a score if the agency does not—
<br>
<br>(A) distribute scores that are used in connection with residential real property loans; or
<br>
<br>(B) develop scores that assist credit providers in understanding the general credit behavior of a consumer and predicting the future credit behavior of the consumer.
<br>(5) Applicability to credit scores developed by another person
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>This subsection shall not be construed to require a consumer reporting agency that distributes credit scores developed by another person or entity to provide a further explanation of them, or to process a dispute arising pursuant to section 1681i of this title, except that the consumer reporting agency shall provide the consumer with the name and address and website for contacting the person or entity who developed the score or developed the methodology of the score.
<br>(B) Exception
<br>
<br>This paragraph shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency that develops or modifies scores that are developed by another person or entity.
<br>(6) Maintenance of credit scores not required
<br>
<br>This subsection shall not be construed to require a consumer reporting agency to maintain credit scores in its files.
<br>(7) Compliance in certain cases
<br>
<br>In complying with this subsection, a consumer reporting agency shall—
<br>
<br>(A) supply the consumer with a credit score that is derived from a credit scoring model that is widely distributed to users by that consumer reporting agency in connection with residential real property loans or with a credit score that assists the consumer in understanding the credit scoring assessment of the credit behavior of the consumer and predictions about the future credit behavior of the consumer; and
<br>
<br>(B) a statement indicating that the information and credit scoring model may be different than that used by the lender.
<br>(8) Fair and reasonable fee
<br>
<br>A consumer reporting agency may charge a fair and reasonable fee, as determined by the Bureau, for providing the information required under this subsection.
<br>(9) Use of enquiries as a key factor
<br>
<br>If a key factor that adversely affects the credit score of a consumer consists of the number of enquiries made with respect to a consumer report, that factor shall be included in the disclosure pursuant to paragraph (1)(C) without regard to the numerical limitation in such paragraph.
<br>(g) Disclosure of credit scores by certain mortgage lenders
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Any person who makes or arranges loans and who uses a consumer credit score, as defined in subsection (f), in connection with an application initiated or sought by a consumer for a closed end loan or the establishment of an open end loan for a consumer purpose that is secured by 1 to 4 units of residential real property (hereafter in this subsection referred to as the "lender") shall provide the following to the consumer as soon as reasonably practicable:
<br>(A) Information required under subsection (f)
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>A copy of the information identified in subsection (f) that was obtained from a consumer reporting agency or was developed and used by the user of the information.
<br>(ii) Notice under subparagraph (D)
<br>
<br>In addition to the information provided to it by a third party that provided the credit score or scores, a lender is only required to provide the notice contained in subparagraph (D).
<br>(B) Disclosures in case of automated underwriting system
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>If a person that is subject to this subsection uses an automated underwriting system to underwrite a loan, that person may satisfy the obligation to provide a credit score by disclosing a credit score and associated key factors supplied by a consumer reporting agency.
<br>(ii) Numerical credit score
<br>
<br>However, if a numerical credit score is generated by an automated underwriting system used by an enterprise, and that score is disclosed to the person, the score shall be disclosed to the consumer consistent with subparagraph (C).
<br>(iii) Enterprise defined
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subparagraph, the term "enterprise" has the same meaning as in paragraph (6) of section 4502 of title 12.
<br>(C) Disclosures of credit scores not obtained from a consumer reporting agency
<br>
<br>A person that is subject to the provisions of this subsection and that uses a credit score, other than a credit score provided by a consumer reporting agency, may satisfy the obligation to provide a credit score by disclosing a credit score and associated key factors supplied by a consumer reporting agency.
<br>(D) Notice to home loan applicants
<br>
<br>A copy of the following notice, which shall include the name, address, and telephone number of each consumer reporting agency providing a credit score that was used:
<br>"notice to the home loan applicant
<br>
<br>"In connection with your application for a home loan, the lender must disclose to you the score that a consumer reporting agency distributed to users and the lender used in connection with your home loan, and the key factors affecting your credit scores.
<br>
<br>"The credit score is a computer generated summary calculated at the time of the request and based on information that a consumer reporting agency or lender has on file. The scores are based on data about your credit history and payment patterns. Credit scores are important because they are used to assist the lender in determining whether you will obtain a loan. They may also be used to determine what interest rate you may be offered on the mortgage. Credit scores can change over time, depending on your conduct, how your credit history and payment patterns change, and how credit scoring technologies change.
<br>
<br>"Because the score is based on information in your credit history, it is very important that you review the credit-related information that is being furnished to make sure it is accurate. Credit records may vary from one company to another.
<br>
<br>"If you have questions about your credit score or the credit information that is furnished to you, contact the consumer reporting agency at the address and telephone number provided with this notice, or contact the lender, if the lender developed or generated the credit score. The consumer reporting agency plays no part in the decision to take any action on the loan application and is unable to provide you with specific reasons for the decision on a loan application.
<br>
<br>"If you have questions concerning the terms of the loan, contact the lender.".
<br>(E) Actions not required under this subsection
<br>
<br>This subsection shall not require any person to—
<br>
<br>(i) explain the information provided pursuant to subsection (f);
<br>
<br>(ii) disclose any information other than a credit score or key factors, as defined in subsection (f);
<br>
<br>(iii) disclose any credit score or related information obtained by the user after a loan has closed;
<br>
<br>(iv) provide more than 1 disclosure per loan transaction; or
<br>
<br>(v) provide the disclosure required by this subsection when another person has made the disclosure to the consumer for that loan transaction.
<br>(F) No obligation for content
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>The obligation of any person pursuant to this subsection shall be limited solely to providing a copy of the information that was received from the consumer reporting agency.
<br>(ii) Limit on liability
<br>
<br>No person has liability under this subsection for the content of that information or for the omission of any information within the report provided by the consumer reporting agency.
<br>(G) Person defined as excluding enterprise
<br>
<br>As used in this subsection, the term "person" does not include an enterprise (as defined in paragraph (6) of section 4502 of title 12).
<br>(2) Prohibition on disclosure clauses null and void
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Any provision in a contract that prohibits the disclosure of a credit score by a person who makes or arranges loans or a consumer reporting agency is void.
<br>(B) No liability for disclosure under this subsection
<br>
<br>A lender shall not have liability under any contractual provision for disclosure of a credit score pursuant to this subsection.
