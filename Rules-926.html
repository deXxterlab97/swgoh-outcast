<br>
<br>"(i) The Government of Syria is incapable, at the time a determination under such subparagraph is made, of fulfilling the requirements to request an agreement under section 303 of the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 2602), including the requirements under subsection (a)(3) of that section.

<br>
<br>"(B) Such material shall be returned to the owner or lawful custodian when requested by such owner or lawful custodian.
<br>
<br>"(C) There is no credible evidence that granting a waiver under this subsection will contribute to illegal trafficking in archaeological or ethnological material of Syria or financing of criminal or terrorist activities.

<br>§2602. Agreements to implement Article 9 of the convention
<br>(a) Agreement authority
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>If the President determines, after request is made to the United States under article 9 of the Convention by any State Party—
<br>
<br>(A) that the cultural patrimony of the State Party is in jeopardy from the pillage of archaeological or ethnological materials of the State Party;
<br>
<br>(B) that the State Party has taken measures consistent with the Convention to protect its cultural patrimony;
<br>
<br>(C) that—
<br>
<br>(i) the application of the import restrictions set forth in section 2606 of this title with respect to archaeological or ethnological material of the State Party, if applied in concert with similar restrictions implemented, or to be implemented within a reasonable period of time, by those nations (whether or not State Parties) individually having a significant import trade in such material, would be of substantial benefit in deterring a serious situation of pillage, and
<br>
<br>(ii) remedies less drastic than the application of the restrictions set forth in such section are not available; and
<br>
<br>(D) that the application of the import restrictions set forth in section 2606 of this title in the particular circumstances is consistent with the general interest of the international community in the interchange of cultural property among nations for scientific, cultural, and educational purposes;
<br>
<br>the President may, subject to the provisions of this chapter, take the actions described in paragraph (2).
<br>(2) Authority of President
<br>
<br>For purposes of paragraph (1), the President may enter into—
<br>
<br>(A) a bilateral agreement with the State Party to apply the import restrictions set forth in section 2606 of this title to the archaeological or ethnological material of the State Party the pillage of which is creating the jeopardy to the cultural patrimony of the State Party found to exist under paragraph (1)(A); or
<br>
<br>(B) a multilateral agreement with the State Party and with one or more other nations (whether or not a State Party) under which the United States will apply such restrictions, and the other nations will apply similar restrictions, with respect to such material.
<br>(3) Requests
<br>
<br>A request made to the United States under article 9 of the Convention by a State Party must be accompanied by a written statement of the facts known to the State Party that relate to those matters with respect to which determinations must be made under subparagraphs (A) through (D) of paragraph (1).
<br>(4) Implementation
<br>
<br>In implementing this subsection, the President should endeavor to obtain the commitment of the State Party concerned to permit the exhange 1 of its archaeological and ethnological materials under circumstances in which such exchange does not jeopardize its cultural patrimony.
<br>(b) Effective period
<br>
<br>The President may not enter into any agreement under subsection (a) which has an effective period beyond the close of the five-year period beginning on the date on which such agreement enters into force with respect to the United States.
<br>(c) Restrictions on entering into agreements
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The President may not enter into a bilateral or multilateral agreement authorized by subsection (a) unless the application of the import restrictions set forth in section 2606 of this title with respect to archaeological or ethnological material of the State Party making a request to the United States under article 9 of the Convention will be applied in concert with similar restrictions implemented, or to be implemented, by those nations (whether or not State Parties) individually having a significant import trade in such material.
<br>(2) Exception to restrictions
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the President may enter into an agreement if he determines that a nation individually having a significant import trade in such material is not implementing, or is not likely to implement, similar restrictions, but—
<br>
<br>(A) such restrictions are not essential to deter a serious situation of pillage, and
<br>
<br>(B) the application of the import restrictions set forth in section 2606 of this title in concert with similar restrictions implemented, or to be implemented, by other nations (whether or not State Parties) individually having a significant import trade in such material would be of substantial benefit in deterring a serious situation of pillage.
<br>(d) Suspension of import restrictions under agreements
<br>
<br>If, after an agreement enters into force with respect to the United States, the President determines that a number of parties to the agreement (other than parties described in subsection (c)(2)) having significant import trade in the archaeological and ethnological material covered by the agreement—
<br>
<br>(1) have not implemented within a reasonable period of time import restrictions that are similar to those set forth in section 2606 of this title, or
<br>
<br>(2) are not implementing such restrictions satisfactorily with the result that no substantial benefit in deterring a serious situation of pillage in the State Party concerned is being obtained,
<br>
<br>the President shall suspend the implementation of the import restrictions under section 2606 of this title until such time as the nations take appropriate corrective action.
<br>(e) Extension of agreements
<br>
<br>The President may extend any agreement that enters into force with respect to the United States for additional periods of not more than five years each if the President determines that—
<br>
<br>(1) the factors referred to in subsection (a)(1) which justified the entering into of the agreement still pertain, and
<br>
<br>(2) no cause for suspension under subsection (d) exists.
<br>(f) Procedures
<br>
<br>If any request described in subsection (a) is made by a State Party, or if the President proposes to extend any agreement under subsection (e), the President shall—
<br>
<br>(1) publish notification of the request or proposal in the Federal Register;
<br>
<br>(2) submit to the Committee such information regarding the request or proposal (including, if applicable, information from the State Party with respect to the implementation of emergency action under section 2603 of this title) as is appropriate to enable the Committee to carry out its duties under section 2605(f) of this title; and
<br>
<br>(3) consider, in taking action on the request or proposal, the views and recommendations contained in any Committee report—
<br>
<br>(A) required under section 2605(f)(1) or (2) of this title, and
<br>
<br>(B) submitted to the President before the close of the one-hundred-and-fifty-day period beginning on the day on which the President submitted information on the request or proposal to the Committee under paragraph (2).
<br>(g) Information on Presidential action
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>In any case in which the President—
<br>
<br>(A) enters into or extends an agreement pursuant to subsection (a) or (e), or
<br>
<br>(B) applies import restrictions under section 2603 of this title,
<br>
<br>the President shall, promptly after taking such action, submit a report to the Congress.
<br>(2) Report
<br>
<br>The report under paragraph (1) shall contain—
<br>
<br>(A) a description of such action (including the text of any agreement entered into),
<br>

<br>
<br>1 So in original. Probably should be "exchange".
<br>§2603. Emergency implementation of import restrictions
<br>(a) "Emergency condition" defined
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, the term "emergency condition" means, with respect to any archaeological or ethnological material of any State Party, that such material is—
<br>
<br>(1) a newly discovered type of material which is of importance for the understanding of the history of mankind and is in jeopardy from pillage, dismantling, dispersal, or fragmentation;
<br>
<br>(2) identifiable as coming from any site recognized to be of high cultural significance if such site is in jeopardy from pillage, dismantling, dispersal, or fragmentation which is, or threatens to be, of crisis proportions; or
<br>
<br>(3) a part of the remains of a particular culture or civilization, the record of which is in jeopardy from pillage, dismantling, dispersal, or fragmentation which is, or threatens to be, of crisis proportions;
<br>
<br>and application of the import restrictions set forth in section 2606 of this title on a temporary basis would, in whole or in part, reduce the incentive for such pillage, dismantling, dispersal or fragmentation.
<br>(b) Presidential action
<br>
<br>Subject to subsection (c), if the President determines that an emergency condition applies with respect to any archaeological or ethnological material of any State Party, the President may apply the import restrictions set forth in section 2606 of this title with respect to such material.
<br>(c) Limitations
<br>
<br>(1) The President may not implement this section with respect to the archaeological or ethnological materials of any State Party unless the State Party has made a request described in section 2602(a) of this title to the United States and has supplied information which supports a determination that an emergency condition exists.
<br>
<br>(2) In taking action under subsection (b) with respect to any State Party, the President shall consider the views and recommendations contained in the Committee report required under section 2605(f)(3) of this title if the report is submitted to the President before the close of the ninety-day period beginning on the day on which the President submitted information to the Committee under section 2602(f)(2) of this title on the request of the State Party under section 2602(a) of this title.
<br>
<br>(3) No import restrictions set forth in section 2606 of this title may be applied under this section to the archaeological or ethnological materials of any State Party for more than five years after the date on which the request of a State Party under section 2602(a) of this title is made to the United States. This period may be extended by the President for three more years if the President determines that the emergency condition continues to apply with respect to the archaeological or ethnological material. However, before taking such action, the President shall request and consider, if received within ninety days, a report of the Committee setting forth its recommendations, together with the reasons therefor, as to whether such import restrictions shall be extended.
<br>
<br>(4) The import restrictions under this section may continue to apply in whole or in part, if before their expiration under paragraph (3), there has entered into force with respect to the archaeological or ethnological materials an agreement under section 2602 of this title or an agreement with a State Party to which the Senate has given its advice and consent to ratification. Such import restrictions may continue to apply for the duration of the agreement.

<br>
<br>After any agreement enters into force under section 2602 of this title, or emergency action is taken under section 2603 of this title, the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall by regulation promulgate (and when appropriate shall revise) a list of the archaeological or ethnological material of the State Party covered by the agreement or by such action. The Secretary may list such material by type or other appropriate classification, but each listing made under this section shall be sufficiently specific and precise to insure that (1) the import restrictions under section 2606 of this title are applied only to the archeological and ethnological material covered by the agreement or emergency action; and (2) fair notice is given to importers and other persons as to what material is subject to such restrictions.

<br>
<br>No designated archaeological or ethnological material that is exported (whether or not such exportation is to the United States) from the State Party after the designation of such material under section 2604 of this title may be imported into the United States unless the State Party issues a certification or other documentation which certifies that such exportation was not in violation of the laws of the State Party.

<br>
<br>the customs officer concerned shall refuse to release the material from customs custody and send it to a bonded warehouse or store to be held at the risk and expense of the consignee, notwithstanding any other provision of law, until such documentation or evidence is filed with such officer. If such documentation or evidence is not presented within ninety days after the date on which such material is refused release from customs custody, or such longer period as may be allowed by the Secretary for good cause shown, the material shall be subject to seizure and forfeiture. The presentation of such documentation or evidence shall not bar subsequent action under section 2609 of this title.

<br>
<br>(ii) neither such importer or person (or any related person) contracted for or acquired an interest, directly or indirectly, in such material more than one year before the date of entry of the material; and
<br>
<br>(B) a statement provided by the consignor, or person who sold the material to the importer, which states the date, or, if not known, his belief, that the material was exported from the State Party not less than ten years before the date of entry into the United States, and the reasons on which the statement is based; and
<br>
<br>(2) for purposes of subsection (b)(2)(B)—
<br>
<br>(A) one or more declarations under oath by the importer or the person for whose account the material is to be imported, stating that, to the best of his knowledge, the material was exported from the State Party on or before the date such material was designated under section 2604 of this title, and
<br>
<br>(B) a statement by the consignor or person who sold the material to the importer which states the date, or if not known, his belief, that the material was exported from the State Party on or before the date such material was designated under section 2604 of this title, and the reasons on which the statement is based.
<br>(d) Related persons
<br>
<br>For purposes of subsections (b) and (c), a person shall be treated as a related person to an importer, or to a person for whose account material is imported, if such person—
<br>
<br>(1) is a member of the same family as the importer or person of account, including, but not limited to, membership as a brother or sister (whether by whole or half blood), spouse, ancestor, or lineal descendant;
<br>
<br>(2) is a partner or associate with the importer or person of account in any partnership, association, or other venture; or

<br>§2609. Seizure and forfeiture
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>Any designated archaeological or ethnological material or article of cultural property, as the case may be, which is imported into the United States in violation of section 2606 of this title or section 2607 of this title shall be subject to seizure and forfeiture. All provisions of law relating to seizure, forfeiture, and condemnation for violation of the customs laws shall apply to seizures and forfeitures incurred, or alleged to have been incurred, under this chapter, insofar as such provisions of law are applicable to, and not inconsistent with, the provisions of this chapter.
<br>(b) Archaeological and ethnological material
<br>
<br>Any designated archaeological or ethnological material which is imported into the United States in violation of section 2606 of this title and which is forfeited to the United States under this chapter shall—
<br>
<br>(1) first be offered for return to the State Party;
<br>
<br>(2) if not returned to the State Party, be returned to a claimant with respect to whom the material was forfeited if that claimant establishes—
<br>
<br>(A) valid title to the material,
<br>
<br>(B) that the claimant is a bona fide purchaser for value of the material; or
<br>
<br>(3) if not returned to the State Party under paragraph (1) or to a claimant under paragraph (2), be disposed of in the manner prescribed by law for articles forfeited for violation of the customs laws.
<br>
<br>No return of material may be made under paragraph (1) or (2) unless the State Party or claimant, as the case may be, bears the expenses incurred incident to the return and delivery, and complies with such other requirements relating to the return as the Secretary shall prescribe.
<br>(c) Articles of cultural property
<br>
<br>(1) In any action for forfeiture under this section regarding an article of cultural property imported into the United States in violation of section 2607 of this title, if the claimant establishes valid title to the article, under applicable law, as against the institution from which the article was stolen, forfeiture shall not be decreed unless the State Party to which the article is to be returned pays the claimant just compensation for the article. In any action for forfeiture under this section where the claimant does not establish such title but establishes that it purchased the article for value without knowledge or reason to believe it was stolen, forfeiture shall not be decreed unless—
<br>
<br>(A) the State Party to which the article is to be returned pays the claimant an amount equal to the amount which the claimant paid for the article, or
<br>
<br>(B) the United States establishes that such State Party, as a matter of law or reciprocity, would in similar circumstances recover and return an article stolen from an institution in the United States without requiring the payment of compensation.
<br>
<br>(2) Any article of cultural property which is imported into the United States in violation of section 2607 of this title and which is forfeited to the United States under this chapter shall—
<br>
<br>(A) first be offered for return to the State Party in whose territory is situated the institution referred to in section 2607 of this title and shall be returned if that State Party bears the expenses incident to such return and delivery and complies with such other requirements relating to the return as the Secretary prescribes; or
<br>
<br>(B) if not returned to such State Party, be disposed of in the manner prescribed by law for articles forfeited for violation of the customs laws.

<br>
<br>(C) if subparagraphs (A) and (B) do not apply, has been within the United States for a period of not less than ten consecutive years and the State Party concerned has received or should have received during such period fair notice (through such adequate and accessible publication, or other means, as the Secretary shall by regulation prescribe) of its location within the United States; and

<br>Findings and Policy
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 106–200, title II, §202, May 18, 2000, 114 Stat. 275, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(a) Findings.—Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>"(1) The Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act [19 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.] (in this title [see Short Title of 2000 Amendment note above] referred to as 'CBERA') represents a permanent commitment by the United States to encourage the development of strong democratic governments and revitalized economies in neighboring countries in the Caribbean Basin.
<br>
<br>"(2) In 1998, Hurricane Mitch and Hurricane Georges devastated areas in the Caribbean Basin region, killing more than 10,000 people and leaving 3,000,000 homeless.
<br>
<br>"(3) The total direct impact of Hurricanes Mitch and Georges on Honduras, Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, and Guatemala amounts to $4,200,000,000, representing a severe loss to income levels in this underdeveloped region.
<br>
<br>"(4) In addition to short term disaster assistance, United States policy toward the region should focus on expanding international trade with the Caribbean Basin region as an enduring solution for successful economic growth and recovery.
<br>
<br>"(5) Thirty-four democratically elected leaders agreed at the 1994 Summit of the Americas to conclude negotiation of a Free Trade Area of the Americas (in this title referred to as 'FTAA') by the year 2005.
<br>
<br>"(6) The economic security of the countries in the Caribbean Basin will be enhanced by the completion of the FTAA.
<br>
<br>"(7) Offering temporary benefits to Caribbean Basin countries will preserve the United States commitment to Caribbean Basin beneficiary countries, promote the growth of free enterprise and economic opportunity in these neighboring countries, and thereby enhance the national security interests of the United States.
<br>
<br>"(8) Given the greater propensity of countries located in the Western Hemisphere to use United States components and to purchase United States products compared to other countries, increased trade and economic activity between the United States and countries in the Western Hemisphere will create new jobs in the United States as a result of expanding export opportunities.
<br>
<br>"(b) Policy.—It is the policy of the United States—
<br>
<br>"(1) to offer Caribbean Basin beneficiary countries willing to prepare to become a party to the FTAA or another free trade agreement, tariff treatment essentially equivalent to that accorded to products of NAFTA countries for certain products not currently eligible for duty-free treatment under the CBERA; and
<br>
<br>"(2) to seek the participation of Caribbean Basin beneficiary countries in the FTAA or another free trade agreement at the earliest possible date, with the goal of achieving full participation in such agreement not later than 2005."
<br>Meetings of Trade Ministers and USTR
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 106–200, title II, §213, May 18, 2000, 114 Stat. 288, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(a) Schedule of Meetings.—The President shall take the necessary steps to convene a meeting with the trade ministers of the CBTPA beneficiary countries in order to establish a schedule of regular meetings, to commence as soon as is practicable, of the trade ministers and the Trade Representative, for the purpose set forth in subsection (b).
<br>
<br>"(b) Purpose.—The purpose of the meetings scheduled under subsection (a) is to reach agreement between the United States and CBTPA beneficiary countries on the likely timing and procedures for initiating negotiations for CBTPA beneficiary countries to enter into mutually advantageous free trade agreements with the United States that contain provisions comparable to those in the NAFTA and would make substantial progress in achieving the negotiating objectives set forth in section 108(b)(5) of Public Law 103–182 ([former] 19 U.S.C. 3317(b)(5)).
<br>
<br>"(c) Definition.—In this section, the term 'CBTPA beneficiary country' has the meaning given that term in section 213(b)(5)(B) of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act [19 U.S.C. 2703(b)(5)(B)]."
<br>Congressional Findings
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 101–382, title II, §202, Aug. 20, 1990, 104 Stat. 655, provided that: "The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>"(1) a stable political and economic climate in the Caribbean region is necessary for the development of the countries in that region and for the security and economic interests of the United States;
<br>
<br>"(2) the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act [this chapter] was enacted in 1983 to assist in the achievement of such a climate by stimulating the development of the export potential of the region; and
<br>
<br>"(3) the commitment of the United States to the successful development of the region, as evidenced by the enactment of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act, should be reaffirmed, and further strengthened, by amending that Act to improve its operation."
<br>Definitions
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 106–200, title II, §203, May 18, 2000, 114 Stat. 276, provided that: "In this title [see Short Title of 2000 Amendment note above]:

<br>"(1) NAFTA.—The term 'NAFTA' means the North American Free Trade Agreement entered into between the United States, Mexico, and Canada on December 17, 1992.
<br>
<br>"(2) NAFTA country.—The term 'NAFTA country' means any country with respect to which the NAFTA is in force.

<br>(F) The term "former beneficiary country" means a country that ceases to be designated as a beneficiary country under this chapter because the country has become a party to a free trade agreement with the United States.
<br>

<br>
<br>(C) has imposed or enforced taxes or other exactions, restrictive maintenance or operational conditions, or other measures with respect to property so owned, the effect of which is to nationalize, expropriate, or otherwise seize ownership or control of such property, unless the President determines that—
<br>

<br>(4) if such country affords preferential treatment to the products of a developed country, other than the United States, which has, or is likely to have, a significant adverse effect on United States commerce, unless the President has received assurances satisfactory to him that such preferential treatment will be eliminated or that action will be taken to assure that there will be no such significant adverse effect, and he reports those assurances to the Congress;
<br>
<br>(5) if a government-owned entity in such country engages in the broadcast of copyrighted material, including films or television material, belonging to United States copyright owners without their express consent;
<br>
<br>(6) unless such country is a signatory to a treaty, convention, protocol, or other agreement regarding the extradition of United States citizens; and

<br>(c) Factors determining designation
<br>
<br>In determining whether to designate any country a beneficiary country under this chapter, the President shall take into account—

<br>
<br>(4) the degree to which such country follows the accepted rules of international trade provided for under the WTO Agreement and the multilateral trade agreements (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (9) and (4), respectively, of section 3501 of this title);
<br>
<br>(5) the degree to which such country uses export subsidies or imposes export performance requirements or local content requirements which distort international trade;
<br>
<br>(6) the degree to which the trade policies of such country as they relate to other beneficiary countries are contributing to the revitalization of the region;
<br>
<br>(7) the degree to which such country is undertaking self-help measures to promote its own economic development;
<br>
<br>(8) whether or not such country has taken or is taking steps to afford to workers in that country (including any designated zone in that country) internationally recognized worker rights.1
<br>

<br>
<br>(1)(A) The President may, after the requirements of subsection (a)(2) and paragraph (2) have been met—

<br>
<br>(ii) withdraw, suspend, or limit the application of duty-free treatment under this chapter to any article of any country,
