<br>§1677f–1. Sampling and averaging; determination of weighted average dumping margin and countervailable subsidy rate
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>For purposes of determining the export price (or constructed export price) under section 1677a of this title or the normal value under section 1677b of this title, and in carrying out reviews under section 1675 of this title, the administering authority may—
<br>
<br>(1) use averaging and statistically valid samples, if there is a significant volume of sales of the subject merchandise or a significant number or types of products, and
<br>
<br>(2) decline to take into account adjustments which are insignificant in relation to the price or value of the merchandise.
<br>(b) Selection of averages and samples
<br>
<br>The authority to select averages and statistically valid samples shall rest exclusively with the administering authority. The administering authority shall, to the greatest extent possible, consult with the exporters and producers regarding the method to be used to select exporters, producers, or types of products under this section.
<br>(c) Determination of dumping margin
<br>(1) General rule
<br>
<br>In determining weighted average dumping margins under section 1673b(d), 1673d(c), or 1675(a) of this title, the administering authority shall determine the individual weighted average dumping margin for each known exporter and producer of the subject merchandise.
<br>(2) Exception
<br>
<br>If it is not practicable to make individual weighted average dumping margin determinations under paragraph (1) because of the large number of exporters or producers involved in the investigation or review, the administering authority may determine the weighted average dumping margins for a reasonable number of exporters or producers by limiting its examination to—
<br>
<br>(A) a sample of exporters, producers, or types of products that is statistically valid based on the information available to the administering authority at the time of selection, or
<br>
<br>(B) exporters and producers accounting for the largest volume of the subject merchandise from the exporting country that can be reasonably examined.
<br>(d) Determination of less than fair value
<br>(1) Investigations
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>In an investigation under part II of this subtitle, the administering authority shall determine whether the subject merchandise is being sold in the United States at less than fair value—
<br>
<br>(i) by comparing the weighted average of the normal values to the weighted average of the export prices (and constructed export prices) for comparable merchandise, or
<br>
<br>(ii) by comparing the normal values of individual transactions to the export prices (or constructed export prices) of individual transactions for comparable merchandise.
<br>(B) Exception
<br>
<br>The administering authority may determine whether the subject merchandise is being sold in the United States at less than fair value by comparing the weighted average of the normal values to the export prices (or constructed export prices) of individual transactions for comparable merchandise, if—
<br>
<br>(i) there is a pattern of export prices (or constructed export prices) for comparable merchandise that differ significantly among purchasers, regions, or periods of time, and
<br>
<br>(ii) the administering authority explains why such differences cannot be taken into account using a method described in paragraph (1)(A)(i) or (ii).
<br>(2) Reviews
<br>
<br>In a review under section 1675 of this title, when comparing export prices (or constructed export prices) of individual transactions to the weighted average price of sales of the foreign like product, the administering authority shall limit its averaging of prices to a period not exceeding the calendar month that corresponds most closely to the calendar month of the individual export sale.
<br>(e) Determination of countervailable subsidy rate
<br>(1) General rule
<br>
<br>In determining countervailable subsidy rates under section 1671b(d), 1671d(c), or 1675(a) of this title, the administering authority shall determine an individual countervailable subsidy rate for each known exporter or producer of the subject merchandise.
<br>(2) Exception
<br>
<br>If the administering authority determines that it is not practicable to determine individual countervailable subsidy rates under paragraph (1) because of the large number of exporters or producers involved in the investigation or review, the administering authority may—
<br>
<br>(A) determine individual countervailable subsidy rates for a reasonable number of exporters or producers by limiting its examination to—
<br>
<br>(i) a sample of exporters or producers that the administering authority determines is statistically valid based on the information available to the administering authority at the time of selection, or
<br>
<br>(ii) exporters and producers accounting for the largest volume of the subject merchandise from the exporting country that the administering authority determines can be reasonably examined; or
<br>
<br>(B) determine a single country-wide subsidy rate to be applied to all exporters and producers.
<br>
<br>The individual countervailable subsidy rates determined under subparagraph (A) shall be used to determine the all-others rate under section 1671d(c)(5) of this title.
<br>(f) Adjustment of antidumping duty in certain proceedings relating to imports from nonmarket economy countries
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>If the administering authority determines, with respect to a class or kind of merchandise from a nonmarket economy country for which an antidumping duty is determined using normal value pursuant to section 1677b(c) of this title, that—
<br>
<br>(A) pursuant to section 1671(a)(1) of this title, a countervailable subsidy (other than an export subsidy referred to in section 1677a(c)(1)(C) of this title) has been provided with respect to the class or kind of merchandise,
<br>
<br>(B) such countervailable subsidy has been demonstrated to have reduced the average price of imports of the class or kind of merchandise during the relevant period, and
<br>
<br>(C) the administering authority can reasonably estimate the extent to which the countervailable subsidy referred to in subparagraph (B), in combination with the use of normal value determined pursuant to section 1677b(c) of this title, has increased the weighted average dumping margin for the class or kind of merchandise,
<br>
<br>the administering authority shall, except as provided in paragraph (2), reduce the antidumping duty by the amount of the increase in the weighted average dumping margin estimated by the administering authority under subparagraph (C).
<br>(2) Maximum reduction in antidumping duty
<br>
<br>The administering authority may not reduce the antidumping duty applicable to a class or kind of merchandise from a nonmarket economy country under this subsection by more than the portion of the countervailing duty rate attributable to a countervailable subsidy that is provided with respect to the class or kind of merchandise and that meets the conditions described in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of paragraph (1).

<br>§1677i. Downstream product monitoring
<br>(a) Petition requesting monitoring
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>A domestic producer of an article that is like a component part or a downstream product may petition the administering authority to designate a downstream product for monitoring under subsection (b). The petition shall specify—
<br>
<br>(A) the downstream product,
<br>
<br>(B) the component product incorporated into such downstream product, and
<br>
<br>(C) the reasons for suspecting that the imposition of antidumping or countervailing duties has resulted in a diversion of exports of the component part into increased production and exportation to the United States of such downstream product.
<br>(2) Determination regarding petition
<br>
<br>Within 14 days after receiving a petition submitted under paragraph (1), the administering authority shall determine—
<br>
<br>(A) whether there is a reasonable likelihood that imports into the United States of the downstream product will increase as an indirect result of any diversion with respect to the component part, and
<br>
<br>(B) whether—
<br>
<br>(i) the component part is already subject to monitoring to aid in the enforcement of a bilateral arrangement (within the meaning of section 804 of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984),
<br>
<br>(ii) merchandise related to the component part and manufactured in the same foreign country in which the component part is manufactured has been the subject of a significant number of investigations suspended under section 1671c or 1673c of this title or countervailing or antidumping duty orders issued under this subtitle or section 1303 1 of this title, or
<br>
<br>(iii) merchandise manufactured or exported by the manufacturer or exporter of the component part that is similar in description and use to the component part has been the subject of at least 2 investigations suspended under section 1671c or 1673c of this title or countervailing or antidumping duty orders issued under this subtitle or section 1303 1 of this title.
<br>(3) Factors to take into account
<br>
<br>In making a determination under paragraph (2)(A), the administering authority may, if appropriate, take into account such factors as—
<br>
<br>(A) the value of the component part in relation to the value of the downstream product,
<br>
<br>(B) the extent to which the component part has been substantially transformed as a result of its incorporation into the downstream product, and
<br>
<br>(C) the relationship between the producers of component parts and producers of downstream products.
<br>(4) Publication of determination
<br>
<br>The administering authority shall publish in the Federal Register notice of each determination made under paragraph (2) and, if the determination made under paragraph (2)(A) and a determination made under any subparagraph of paragraph (2)(B) are affirmative, shall transmit a copy of such determinations and the petition to the Commission.
<br>(5) Determinations not subject to judicial review
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any determination made by the administering authority under paragraph (2) shall not be subject to judicial review.
<br>(b) Monitoring by Commission
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>If the determination made under subsection (a)(2)(A) and a determination made under any clause of subsection (a)(2)(B) with respect to a petition are affirmative, the Commission shall immediately commence monitoring of trade in the downstream product that is the subject of the determination made under subsection (a)(2)(A). If the Commission finds that imports of a downstream product being monitored increased during any calendar quarter by 5 percent or more over the preceding quarter, the Commission shall analyze that increase in the context of overall economic conditions in the product sector.
<br>(2) Reports
<br>
<br>The Commission shall make quarterly reports to the administering authority regarding the monitoring and analyses conducted under paragraph (1). The Commission shall make the reports available to the public.
<br>(c) Action on basis of monitoring reports
<br>
<br>The administering authority shall review the information in the reports submitted by the Commission under subsection (b)(2) and shall—
<br>
<br>(1) consider the information in determining whether to initiate an investigation under section 1671a(a) or 1673a(a) of this title regarding any downstream product, and
<br>
<br>(2) request the Commission to cease monitoring any downstream product if the information indicates that imports into the United States are not increasing and there is no reasonable likelihood of diversion with respect to component parts.
<br>(d) Definitions
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section—
<br>
<br>(1) The term "component part" means any imported article that—
<br>
<br>(A) during the 5-year period ending on the date on which the petition is filed under subsection (a), has been subject to—
<br>
<br>(i) a countervailing or antidumping duty order issued under this subtitle or section 1303 1 of this title that requires the deposit of estimated countervailing or antidumping duties imposed at a rate of at least 15 percent ad valorem, or
<br>
<br>(ii) an agreement entered into under section 1671c, 1673c, or 1303 1 of this title after a preliminary affirmative determination under section 1671b(b), 1673b(b)(1), or 1303 1 of this title was made by the administering authority which included a determination that the estimated net countervailable subsidy was at least 15 percent ad valorem or that the estimated average amount by which the normal value exceeded the export price (or the constructed export price) was at least 15 percent ad valorem, and
<br>
<br>(B) because of its inherent characteristics, is routinely used as a major part, component, assembly, subassembly, or material in a downstream product.
<br>
<br>(2) The term "downstream product" means any manufactured article—
<br>
<br>(A) which is imported into the United States, and
<br>
<br>(B) into which is incorporated any component part.
<br>

<br>(d) Later-developed merchandise
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>For purposes of determining whether merchandise developed after an investigation is initiated under this subtitle or section 1303 1 of this title (hereafter in this paragraph referred to as the "later-developed merchandise") is within the scope of an outstanding antidumping or countervailing duty order issued under this subtitle or section 1303 1 of this title as a result of such investigation, the administering authority shall consider whether—

<br>(2) Exclusion from orders
<br>
<br>The administering authority may not exclude a later-developed merchandise from a countervailing or antidumping duty order merely because the merchandise—
<br>
<br>(A) is classified under a tariff classification other than that identified in the petition or the administering authority's prior notices during the proceeding, or
<br>
<br>(B) permits the purchaser to perform additional functions, unless such additional functions constitute the primary use of the merchandise and the cost of the additional functions constitute more than a significant proportion of the total cost of production of the merchandise.
<br>(e) Commission advice
<br>(1) Notification to Commission of proposed action
<br>
<br>Before making a determination—
<br>
<br>(A) under subsection (a) with respect to merchandise completed or assembled in the United States (other than minor completion or assembly),
<br>
<br>(B) under subsection (b) with respect to merchandise completed or assembled in other foreign countries, or
<br>
<br>(C) under subsection (d) with respect to any later-developed merchandise which incorporates a significant technological advance or significant alteration of an earlier product,
<br>
<br>with respect to an antidumping or countervailing duty order or finding as to which the Commission has made an affirmative injury determination, the administering authority shall notify the Commission of the proposed inclusion of such merchandise in such countervailing or antidumping order or finding. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a decision by the administering authority regarding whether any merchandise is within a category for which notice is required under this paragraph is not subject to judicial review.
<br>(2) Request for consultation
<br>
<br>After receiving notice under paragraph (1), the Commission may request consultations with the administering authority regarding the inclusion. Upon the request of the Commission, the administering authority shall consult with the Commission and any such consultation shall be completed within 15 days after the date of the request.
<br>(3) Commission advice
<br>
<br>If the Commission believes, after consultation under paragraph (2), that a significant injury issue is presented by the proposed inclusion, the Commission may provide written advice to the administering authority as to whether the inclusion would be inconsistent with the affirmative determination of the Commission on which the order or finding is based. If the Commission decides to provide such written advice, it shall promptly notify the administering authority of its intention to do so, and must provide such advice within 60 days after the date of notification under paragraph (1). For purposes of formulating its advice with respect to merchandise completed or assembled in the United States from parts or components produced in a foreign country, the Commission shall consider whether the inclusion of such parts or components taken as a whole would be inconsistent with its prior affirmative determination.
<br>(f) Time limits for administering authority determinations
<br>
<br>The administering authority shall, to the maximum extent practicable, make the determinations under this section within 300 days from the date of the initiation of a countervailing duty or antidumping circumvention inquiry under this section.

<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>In any investigation under part I or II of this subtitle or a review under section 1675(a) of this title in which the administering authority has, under section 1677f–1(c)(2) of this title or section 1677f–1(e)(2)(A) of this title (whichever is applicable), limited the number of exporters or producers examined, or determined a single country-wide rate, the administering authority shall establish an individual countervailable subsidy rate or an individual weighted average dumping margin for any exporter or producer not initially selected for individual examination under such sections who submits to the administering authority the information requested from exporters or producers selected for examination, if—
<br>
<br>(A) such information is so submitted by the date specified—
<br>
<br>(i) for exporters and producers that were initially selected for examination, or
<br>
<br>(ii) for the foreign government, in a countervailing duty case where the administering authority has determined a single country-wide rate; and
<br>
<br>(B) the number of exporters or producers subject to the investigation or review is not so large that any additional individual examination of such exporters or producers would be unduly burdensome to the administering authority and inhibit the timely completion of the investigation or review.
<br>(2) Determination of unduly burdensome
<br>
<br>In determining if an individual examination under paragraph (1)(B) would be unduly burdensome, the administering authority may consider the following:
<br>
<br>(A) The complexity of the issues or information presented in the proceeding, including questionnaires and any responses thereto.
<br>
<br>(B) Any prior experience of the administering authority in the same or similar proceeding.
<br>

<br>
<br>(D) Such other factors relating to the timely completion of each such investigation and review as the administering authority considers appropriate.
<br>(b) Certification of submissions
<br>
<br>Any person providing factual information to the administering authority or the Commission in connection with a proceeding under this subtitle on behalf of the petitioner or any other interested party shall certify that such information is accurate and complete to the best of that person's knowledge.
<br>(c) Difficulties in meeting requirements
