<br>

<br>
<br>(3) any negotiated grievance procedures under section 7121 of title 5, including any provisions relating to binding arbitration, shall, with respect to any personnel action to which subchapter II of chapter 75 of such title applies (as determined under section 7512 of such title), be available to the same extent and in the same manner as if employees of the Panama Canal Commission were not excluded from such subchapter under section 7511(b)(8) of such title.

<br>
<br>(1) This subsection applies to any matter that becomes the subject of collective bargaining between the Commission and the exclusive representative for any bargaining unit of employees of the Commission during the period beginning on November 18, 1997, and ending on the Canal Transfer Date.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) The resolution of impasses resulting from collective bargaining between the Commission and any such exclusive representative during that period shall be conducted in accordance with such procedures as may be mutually agreed upon between the Commission and the exclusive representative (without regard to any otherwise applicable provisions of chapter 71 of title 5). Such mutually agreed upon procedures shall become effective upon transmittal by the Chairman of the Supervisory Board of the Commission to the Congress of notice of the agreement to use those procedures and a description of those procedures.
<br>
<br>(B) The Federal Services Impasses Panel shall not have jurisdiction to resolve any impasse between the Commission and any such exclusive representative in negotiations over a procedure for resolving impasses.

<br>(3) If the Commission and such an exclusive representative do not reach an agreement concerning a procedure for resolving impasses with respect to a bargaining unit and transmit notice of the agreement under paragraph (2) on or before July 1, 1998, the following shall be the procedure by which collective bargaining impasses between the Commission and the exclusive representative for that bargaining unit shall be resolved:
<br>
<br>(A) If bargaining efforts do not result in an agreement, either party may timely request the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to assist in achieving an agreement.
<br>
<br>(B) If an agreement is not reached within 45 days after the date on which either party requests the assistance of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service in writing (or within such shorter period as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties), the parties shall be considered to be at an impasse and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service shall immediately notify the Federal Services Impasses Panel of the Federal Labor Relations Authority, which shall decide the impasse.
<br>
<br>(C) If the Federal Services Impasses Panel fails to issue a decision within 90 days after the date on which notice under subparagraph (B) is received by the Panel (or within such shorter period as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties), the efforts of the Panel shall be terminated.
<br>
<br>(D) In such a case, the Chairman of the Panel (or another member in the absence of the Chairman) shall immediately determine the matter by a drawing (conducted in such manner as the Chairman (or, in the absence of the Chairman, such other member) determines appropriate) between the last offer of the Commission and the last offer of the exclusive representative, with the offer chosen through such drawing becoming the binding resolution of the matter.
<br>
<br>(4) In the case of a notice of agreement described in paragraph (2)(A) that is transmitted to the Congress as described in the second sentence of that paragraph after July 1, 1998, the impasse resolution procedures covered by that notice shall apply to any impasse between the Commission and the other party to the agreement that is unresolved on the date on which that notice is transmitted to the Congress.

<br>§3712. Panama Canal Revolving Fund
<br>(a) Establishment
<br>
<br>There is established in the Treasury of the United States a revolving fund to be known as "Panama Canal Revolving Fund". The Panama Canal Revolving Fund shall, subject to subsection (b), be available to the Commission to carry out the purposes, functions, and powers authorized by this chapter, including for the following purposes:
<br>
<br>(1) The hire of passenger motor vehicles and aircraft.
<br>
<br>(2) Uniforms or allowances therefor.
<br>
<br>(3) Official receptions and representation expenses of the Board, the Secretary of the Commission, and the Administrator.
<br>
<br>(4) The operation of guide services.
<br>
<br>(5) A residence for the Administrator.
<br>
<br>(6) Disbursements by the Administrator for employee and community projects.
<br>
<br>(7) The procurement of expert and consultant services.
<br>
<br>(8) Promotional activities, including the preparation, distribution, or use of any kit, pamphlet, booklet, publication, radio, television, film, or other media presentation designed to promote the Panama Canal as a resource of the world shipping industry.
<br>
<br>(9) The purchase and transportation to the Republic of Panama of passenger motor vehicles, including large, heavy-duty vehicles.
<br>
<br>(10) Payment to the Panama Canal Authority, not later than the Canal Transfer Date, of such amount as is computed by the Commission to be the future amount of severance pay to be paid by the Panama Canal Authority to employees whose employment with the Authority is terminated, to the extent that such severance pay is attributable to periods of service performed with the Commission before the Canal Transfer Date (and assuming for purposes of such computation that the Panama Canal Authority, in paying severance pay to terminated employees, will provide for crediting of periods of service with the Commission).
<br>(b) Tolls and other receipts into Panama Canal Revolving Fund; restriction on use of funds
<br>
<br>(1) There shall be deposited in the Panama Canal Revolving Fund, on a continuing basis, toll receipts (other than amounts of toll receipts deposited into the Panama Canal Commission Dissolution Fund under section 3714a of this title) and all other receipts of the Commission. Except as provided in section 3713 of this title, no funds may be obligated or expended by the Commission in any fiscal year unless such obligation or expenditure has been specifically authorized by law.
<br>
<br>(2) No funds may be authorized for the use of the Commission, or obligated or expended by the Commission in any fiscal year; in excess of—
<br>
<br>(A) the amount of revenues deposited in the Panama Canal Revolving Fund and the Panama Canal Commission Dissolution Fund during such fiscal year; plus
<br>
<br>(B) the amount of revenues deposited in the Panama Canal Revolving Fund before such fiscal year and remaining unobligated at the beginning of such fiscal year; plus
<br>
<br>(C) the $100,000,000 borrowing authority provided for in section 3714 of this title.
<br>
<br>Not later than 30 days after the end of each fiscal year, the Secretary of the Treasury shall report to the Congress the amount of revenues deposited in the Panama Canal Revolving Fund during such fiscal year.
<br>(c) Authority of Commission to make deposits
<br>
<br>With the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, the Commission may deposit amounts in the Panama Canal Revolving Fund in any Federal Reserve bank, any depositary for public funds, or such other place and in such manner as the Commission and the Secretary may agree.
<br>(d) Costs of implementation
<br>
<br>(1) It is the sense of the Congress that the additional costs resulting from the implementation of the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977 and related agreements should be kept to the absolute minimum level. To this end, the Congress declares appropriated costs of implementation to be borne by the taxpayers over the life of such Treaty should be kept to a level no greater than the March 1979 estimate of those costs ($870,700,000) presented to the Congress by the executive branch during consideration of this chapter by the Congress, less personnel retirement costs of $205,000,000, which were subtracted and charged to tolls, therefore resulting in net taxpayer cost of approximately $665,700,000, plus appropriate adjustments for inflation.
<br>
<br>(2) It is further the sense of the Congress that the actual costs of implementation be consistent with the obligations of the United States to operate the Panama Canal safely and efficiently and keep it secure.
<br>(e) Termination of Commission and Office of Transition Administration; transfer of Fund
<br>
<br>(1) The Panama Canal Commission and the Office of Transition Administration (described in section 3504 of Public Law 106–65) shall terminate on October 1, 2004.
<br>
<br>(2) Upon termination pursuant to paragraph (1), the Panama Canal Revolving Fund shall be transferred to the General Services Administration (GSA). GSA shall use the amounts in the Fund to make payments of any outstanding liabilities of the Commission, as well as any expenses associated with the termination of the Office of Transition Administration and the Commission. The fund shall be the exclusive source available for payment of any outstanding liabilities of the Commission.

<br>
<br>In determining whether operating revenues exceed expenditures for the purpose of payments to the Republic of Panama under paragraph 4(c) of Article XIII of the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977, such operating revenues in a fiscal period shall be reduced by (1) all costs of such period as shown by the accounts established pursuant to section 3721 of this title, and (2) the cumulative sum from prior years (beginning with the year in which the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977 enters into force) of any excess of costs of the Panama Canal Commission over operating revenues.

<br>Any accumulated unpaid balance under paragraph 4(c) of Article XIII of the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977 at the termination of such Treaty shall be payable only to the extent of any operating surplus in the last year of the Treaty's duration, and nothing in such paragraph may be construed as obligating the United States to pay after the date of the termination of the Treaty any such unpaid balance which has accrued before such date.

If the negligence or fault of the vessel, master, crew, or passengers proximately contributed to the injury, the award of damages shall be diminished in proportion to the negligence or fault attributable to the vessel, master, crew, or passengers. Damages may not be allowed and paid for injuries to any protrusion beyond any portion of the hull of a vessel, whether it is permanent or temporary in character. A vessel is considered to be passing through the locks of the Canal, under the control of officers or employees of the United States, from the time the first towing line is made fast on board before entrance into the locks and until the towing lines are cast off upon, or immediately prior to, departure from the lock chamber. No payment for damages on a claim may be made under this section unless the claim is filed with the Commission within one year after the date of the injury or by November 18, 1998, whichever is later.
<br>
<br>(b)(1) With respect to a claim under subsection (a) for damages for injuries to a vessel or its cargo, if, at the time the injuries were incurred, the navigation or movement of the vessel was not under the control of a Panama Canal pilot, the Commission may pay not more than $50,000 on the claim, unless the injuries were caused by another vessel under the control of a Panama Canal pilot.

<br>§3773. Measure of damages generally
<br>
<br>In determining the amount of the award of damages for injuries to a vessel for which the Commission is determined to be liable, there may be included—
<br>
<br>(1) the actual or estimated cost of repairs;
<br>
<br>(2) charter hire actually lost by the owners, or charter hire actually paid, depending upon the terms of the charter party, for the time the vessel is undergoing repairs;
<br>
<br>(3) maintenance of the vessel and wages of the crew, if they are found to be actual additional expenses or losses incurred outside of the charter hire; and
<br>
<br>(4) other expenses which are definitely and accurately shown to have been incurred necessarily and by reason of the accident or injuries.
<br>
<br>Agent's fees, or commissions, or other incidental expenses of similar character, or any items which are indefinite, indeterminable, speculative, or conjectural may not be allowed. The Commission shall be furnished such vouchers, receipts, or other evidence as may be necessary in support of any item of a claim. If a vessel is not operated under charter but by the owner directly, evidence shall be secured if available as to the sum for which vessels of the same size and class can be chartered in the market. If the charter value cannot be determined, the value of the vessel to its owners in the business in which it was engaged at the time of the injuries shall be used as a basis for estimating the damages for the vessel's detention; and the books of the owners showing the vessel's earnings about the time of the accident or injuries shall be considered as evidence of probable earnings during the time of detention. If the books are unavailable, such other evidence shall be furnished as may be necessary.

<br>
<br>(3) obstruction arising from accidents;
<br>
<br>(4) time necessary for admeasurement;
<br>
<br>(5) congestion of traffic;
<br>
<br>(6) investigation of a marine accident that is conducted within 24 hours after the accident occurs, except that any liability of the Commission beyond that 24-hour period shall be limited to the extent to which the accident was caused, or contributed to, by the negligence of an employee of the Commission acting within the scope of the employee's official duties; or
<br>
<br>(7) except as specially set forth in this subpart, any other cause.
