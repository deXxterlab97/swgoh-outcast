<br>Codification
<br>
<br>This section was enacted as part of the HBCU Propelling Agency Relationships Towards a New Era of Results for Students Act or the HBCU PARTNERS Act, and not as part of the Higher Education Act of 1965 which comprises this chapter.
<br>Findings and Purposes
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 116–270, §2, Dec. 31, 2020, 134 Stat. 3325, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(a) Findings.—Congress finds the following:
<br>
<br>"(1) As many colleges and universities across the country kept their doors closed to African American applicants, historically Black colleges and universities (referred to in this section as 'HBCUs') played a central role in ensuring that African Americans could attain an excellent education.
<br>
<br>"(2) Today, HBCUs continue to play a critical role in ensuring that African Americans, and those of all races, can access high-quality educational opportunities.
<br>
<br>"(3) HBCUs enroll nearly 300,000 students, an estimated 70 percent of whom come from low-income backgrounds and 80 percent of whom are African American.
<br>
<br>"(4) According to the National Association For Equal Opportunity In Higher Education (referred to in this section as 'NAFEO'), HBCUs make up just 3 percent of American institutions of higher education but serve more than a fifth of African American college students.
<br>
<br>"(5) According to the Thurgood Marshall College Fund (referred to in this section as 'TMCF'), approximately 9 percent of all African American college students attend HBCUs.
<br>
<br>"(6) A March 2017 report from the Education Trust concluded that HBCUs have higher completion rates for African American students than other institutions serving similar student populations.
<br>
<br>"(7) According to TMCF, 40 percent of African American Members of Congress, 50 percent of African American lawyers, and 80 percent of African American judges are graduates of HBCUs.
<br>
<br>"(8) According to NAFEO, HBCUs graduate approximately 50 percent of African American public school teaching professionals.
<br>
<br>"(9) According to the United Negro College Fund (referred to in this section as 'UNCF'), African American graduates of HBCUs are almost twice as likely as African Americans who graduated from other institutions to report that their university prepared them well for life.
<br>
<br>"(10) According to a study commissioned by UNCF, in 2014, HBCUs generated a total direct economic impact of $14,800,000,000 and created more than 134,000 jobs.
<br>
<br>"(11) According to a 2019 report produced by the American Council on Education and UNCF, despite efforts to counter a historical legacy of inequitable funding and notable investments by the Federal Government and many State governments, resource inequities continue to plague HBCUs.
<br>
<br>"(b) Purposes.—The purposes of this Act are—
<br>
<br>"(1) to strengthen the capacity and competitiveness of HBCUs to fulfill their principal mission of equalizing educational opportunity, as described in section 301(b) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1051(b));
<br>
<br>"(2) to align HBCUs with the educational and economic competitiveness priorities of the United States;
<br>
<br>"(3) to provide students enrolled at HBCUs with the highest quality educational and economic opportunities;
<br>
<br>"(4) to bolster and facilitate productive interactions between HBCUs and Federal agencies; and
<br>
<br>"(5) to encourage HBCU participation in and benefit from Federal programs, grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements."

<br>§1065. Endowment challenge grants
<br>(a) Purpose; definitions
<br>
<br>(1) The purpose of this section is to establish a program to provide matching grants to eligible institutions in order to establish or increase endowment funds at such institutions, to provide additional incentives to promote fund raising activities by such institutions, and to foster increased independence and self-sufficiency at such institutions.
<br>
<br>(2) For the purpose of this section:
<br>
<br>(A) The term "endowment fund" means a fund established by State law, by an institution of higher education, or by a foundation which is exempt from taxation and is maintained for the purpose of generating income for the support of the institution, but which shall not include real estate.
<br>
<br>(B) The term "endowment fund corpus" means an amount equal to the grant or grants awarded under this section plus an amount equal to such grant or grants provided by the institution.
<br>
<br>(C) The term "endowment fund income" means an amount equal to the total value of the endowment fund established under this section minus the endowment fund corpus.
<br>
<br>(D)(i) The term "eligible institution" means an institution that is an—
<br>
<br>(I) eligible institution under part A or would be considered to be such an institution if section 1058(b)(1)(C) of this title referred to a postgraduate degree rather than a bachelor's degree;
<br>
<br>(II) institution eligible for assistance under part B or would be considered to be such an institution if section 1063 of this title referred to a postgraduate degree rather than a baccalaureate degree; or
<br>
<br>(III) institution of higher education that makes a substantial contribution to postgraduate medical educational opportunities for minorities and the economically disadvantaged.
<br>
<br>(ii) The Secretary may waive the requirements of subclauses (I) and (II) of clause (i) with respect to a postgraduate degree in the case of any institution otherwise eligible under clause (i) for an endowment challenge grant upon determining that the institution makes a substantial contribution to medical education opportunities for minorities and the economically disadvantaged.
<br>(b) Grants authorized
<br>
<br>(1) From sums available for this section under section 1068h of this title, the Secretary is authorized to award endowment challenge grants to eligible institutions to establish or increase an endowment fund at such institution. Such grants shall be made only to eligible institutions described in paragraph (4) whose applications have been approved pursuant to subsection (g).
<br>
<br>(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), no institution shall receive a grant under this section, unless such institution has deposited in its endowment fund established under this section an amount equal to the amount of such grant. The source of funds for this institutional match shall not include Federal funds or funds from an existing endowment fund.
<br>
<br>(B) The Secretary may make a grant under this part to an eligible institution in any fiscal year if the institution—
<br>
<br>(i) applies for a grant in an amount not exceeding $1,000,000; and
<br>
<br>(ii) has deposited in the eligible institution's endowment fund established under this section an amount which is equal to ½ of the amount of such grant.
<br>
<br>(C) An eligible institution of higher education that is awarded a grant under subparagraph (B) shall not be eligible to receive an additional grant under subparagraph (B) until 10 years after the date on which the grant period terminates.
<br>
<br>(3) The period of a grant under this section shall be not more than 20 years. During the grant period, an institution may not withdraw or expend any of the endowment fund corpus. After the termination of the grant period, an institution may use the endowment fund corpus plus any endowment fund income for any educational purpose.
<br>
<br>(4)(A) An institution of higher education is eligible to receive a grant under this section if it is an eligible institution as described in subsection (a)(2)(D) of this section.
<br>
<br>(B) No institution shall be ineligible for an endowment challenge grant under this section for a fiscal year by reason of the previous receipt of such a grant but no institution shall be eligible to receive such a grant for more than 2 fiscal years out of any period of 5 consecutive fiscal years.
<br>
<br>(5) An endowment challenge grant awarded under this section to an eligible institution shall be in an amount which is not less than $100,000 in any fiscal year.
<br>
<br>(6)(A) An eligible institution may designate a foundation, which was established for the purpose of raising money for the institution, as the recipient of the grant awarded under this section.
<br>
<br>(B) The Secretary shall not award a grant to a foundation on behalf of an institution unless—
<br>
<br>(i) the institution assures the Secretary that the foundation is legally authorized to receive the endowment fund corpus and is legally authorized to administer the fund in accordance with this section and any implementing regulation;
<br>
<br>(ii) the foundation agrees to administer the fund in accordance with the requirements of this section and any implementing regulation; and
<br>
<br>(iii) the institution agrees to be liable for any violation by the foundation of the provisions of this section and any implementing regulation, including any monetary liability that may arise as a result of such violation.
<br>(c) Grant agreement; endowment fund provisions
<br>
<br>(1) An institution awarded a grant under this section shall enter into an agreement with the Secretary containing satisfactory assurances that it will (A) immediately comply with the matching requirements of subsection (b)(2), (B) establish an endowment fund independent of any other such fund of the institution, (C) invest the endowment fund corpus, and (D) meet the other requirements of this section.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) An institution shall invest the endowment fund corpus and endowment fund income in low-risk securities in which a regulated insurance company may invest under the law of the State in which the institution is located such as a federally insured bank savings account or comparable interest-bearing account, certificate of deposit, money market fund, mutual fund, or obligations of the United States.
<br>
<br>(B) The institution, in investing the endowment fund established under this section, shall exercise the judgment and care, under the circumstances then prevailing, which a person of prudence, discretion, and intelligence would exercise in the management of such person's own affairs.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) An institution may withdraw and expend the endowment fund income to defray any expenses necessary to the operation of such college, including expenses of operations and maintenance, administration, academic and support personnel, construction and renovation, community and student services programs, and technical assistance.
<br>
<br>(B)(i) Except as provided in clause (ii), an institution may not spend more than 50 percent of the total aggregate endowment fund income earned prior to the time of expenditure.
<br>
<br>(ii) The Secretary may permit an institution to spend more than 50 percent of the endowment fund income notwithstanding clause (i) if the institution demonstrates such an expenditure is necessary because of (I) a financial emergency, such as a pending insolvency or temporary liquidity problem; (II) a life-threatening situation occasioned by a natural disaster or arson; or (III) any other unusual occurrence or exigent circumstance.
<br>(d) Repayment provisions
<br>
<br>(1) If at any time an institution withdraws part of the endowment fund corpus, the institution shall repay to the Secretary an amount equal to 50 percent of the withdrawn amount, which represents the Federal share, plus income earned thereon. The Secretary may use such repaid funds to make additional challenge grants, or to increase existing endowment grants, to other eligible institutions.
<br>
<br>(2) If an institution expends more of the endowment fund income than is permitted under subsection (c), the institution shall repay the Secretary an amount equal to 50 percent of the amount improperly expended (representing the Federal share thereof). The Secretary may use such repaid fund to make additional challenge grants, or to increase existing challenge grants, to other eligible institutions.
<br>(e) Audit information
<br>
<br>An institution receiving a grant under this section shall provide to the Secretary (or a designee thereof) such information (or access thereto) as may be necessary to audit or examine expenditures made from the endowment fund corpus or income in order to determine compliance with this section.
<br>(f) Selection criteria
<br>
<br>In selecting eligible institutions for grants under this section for any fiscal year, the Secretary shall—
<br>
<br>(1) give priority to an applicant that is receiving assistance under part A or part B or has received a grant under part A of this subchapter or part B of this subchapter within the 5 fiscal years preceding the fiscal year in which the applicant is applying for a grant under this section;
<br>
<br>(2) give priority to an applicant with a greater need for such a grant, based on the current market value of the applicant's existing endowment in relation to the number of full-time equivalent students enrolled at such institution; and
<br>
<br>(3) consider—
<br>
<br>(A) the effort made by the applicant to build or maintain its existing endowment fund; and
<br>
<br>(B) the degree to which an applicant proposes to match the grant with nongovernmental funds.
<br>(g) Application
<br>
<br>Any institution which is eligible for assistance under this section may submit to the Secretary a grant application at such time, in such form, and containing such information as the Secretary may prescribe, including a description of the long- and short-term plans for raising and using the funds under this part. Subject to the availability of appropriations to carry out this section and consistent with the requirement of subsection (f), the Secretary may approve an application for a grant if an institution, in its application, provides adequate assurances that it will comply with the requirements of this section.
<br>(h) Termination and recovery provisions
<br>
<br>(1) After notice and an opportunity for a hearing, the Secretary may terminate and recover a grant awarded under this section if the grantee institution—
<br>
<br>(A) expends portions of the endowment fund corpus or expends more than the permissible amount of the endowment funds income as prescribed in subsection (c)(3);
<br>
<br>(B) fails to invest the endowment fund in accordance with the investment standards set forth in subsection (c)(2); or
<br>
<br>(C) fails to properly account to the Secretary concerning the investment and expenditures of the endowment funds.
<br>
<br>(2) If the Secretary terminates a grant under paragraph (1), the grantee shall return to the Secretary an amount equal to the sum of each original grant under this section plus income earned thereon. The Secretary may use such repaid funds to make additional endowment grants, or to increase existing challenge grants, to other eligible institutions under this part.
<br>(i) Technical assistance
<br>
<br>The Secretary, directly or by grant or contract, may provide technical assistance to eligible institutions to prepare the institutions to qualify, apply for, and maintain a grant, under this section.

<br>§1066. Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) a significant part of the Federal mission in education has been to attain equal opportunity in higher education for low-income, educationally disadvantaged Americans and African Americans;
<br>
<br>(2) the Nation's historically Black colleges and universities have played a prominent role in American history and have an unparalleled record of fostering the development of African American youth by recognizing their potential, enhancing their academic and technical skills, and honing their social and political skills through higher education;
<br>
<br>(3) the academic and residential facilities on the campuses of all historically Black colleges and universities have suffered from neglect, deferred maintenance and are in need of capital improvements in order to provide appropriate settings for learning and social development through higher education;
<br>
<br>(4) due to their small enrollments, limited endowments and other financial factors normally considered by lenders in construction financing, historically Black colleges and universities often lack access to the sources of funding necessary to undertake the necessary capital improvements through borrowing and bond financing;
<br>
<br>(5) despite their track record of long-standing and remarkable institutional longevity and viability, historically Black colleges and universities often lack the financial resources necessary to gain access to traditional sources of capital financing such as bank loans and bond financing; and
<br>
<br>(6) Federal assistance to facilitate low-cost capital basis for historically Black colleges and universities will enable such colleges and universities to continue and expand their educational mission and enhance their significant role in American higher education.

<br>(b) Responsibilities of designated bonding authority
<br>
<br>The Secretary may not enter into an insurance agreement described in subsection (a) unless the Secretary designates a qualified bonding authority in accordance with sections 1066d(1) and 1066e 1 of this title and the designated bonding authority agrees in such agreement to—
<br>
<br>(1) use the proceeds of the qualified bonds, less costs of issuance not to exceed 2 percent of the principal amount thereof, to make loans to eligible institutions or for deposit into an escrow account for repayment of the bonds;
<br>
<br>(2) provide in each loan agreement with respect to a loan that not less than 95 percent of the proceeds of the loan will be used—
<br>
<br>(A) to finance the repair, renovation, and, in exceptional cases, construction or acquisition, of a capital project; or
<br>
<br>(B) to refinance an obligation the proceeds of which were used to finance the repair, renovation, and, in exceptional cases, construction or acquisition, of a capital project;
<br>
<br>(3)(A) charge such interest on loans, and provide for such a schedule of repayments of loans, as will, upon the timely repayment of the loans, provide adequate and timely funds for the payment of principal and interest on the bonds; and
<br>
<br>(B) require that any payment on a loan expected to be necessary to make a payment of principal and interest on the bonds be due not less than 60 days prior to the date of the payment on the bonds for which such loan payment is expected to be needed;
<br>
<br>(4) prior to the making of any loan, provide for a credit review of the institution receiving the loan and assure the Secretary that, on the basis of such credit review, it is reasonable to anticipate that the institution receiving the loan will be able to repay the loan in a timely manner pursuant to the terms thereof;
<br>
<br>(5) provide in each loan agreement with respect to a loan that, if a delinquency on such loan results in a funding under the insurance agreement, the institution obligated on such loan shall repay the Secretary, upon terms to be determined by the Secretary, for such funding;
<br>
<br>(6) assign any loans to the Secretary, upon the demand of the Secretary, if a delinquency on such loan has required a funding under the insurance agreement;
<br>
<br>(7) in the event of a delinquency on a loan, engage in such collection efforts as the Secretary shall require for a period of not less than 45 days prior to requesting a funding under the insurance agreement;
<br>
<br>(8) establish an escrow account—
<br>
<br>(A) into which each eligible institution shall deposit 5 percent of the proceeds of any loan made under this part, with each eligible institution required to maintain in the escrow account an amount equal to 5 percent of the outstanding principal of all loans made to such institution under this part; and
<br>
<br>(B) the balance of which—
<br>
<br>(i) shall be available to the Secretary to pay principal and interest on the bonds in the event of delinquency in loan repayment; and
<br>
<br>(ii) shall be used to return to an eligible institution an amount equal to any remaining portion of such institution's 5 percent deposit of loan proceeds within 120 days following scheduled repayment of such institution's loan;
<br>
<br>(9) provide in each loan agreement with respect to a loan that, if a delinquency on such loan results in amounts being withdrawn from the escrow account to pay principal and interest on bonds, subsequent payments on such loan shall be available to replenish such escrow account;
<br>
<br>(10) comply with the limitations set forth in section 1066c of this title;
<br>
<br>(11) make loans only to eligible institutions under this part in accordance with conditions prescribed by the Secretary to ensure that loans are fairly allocated among as many eligible institutions as possible, consistent with making loans of amounts that will permit capital projects of sufficient size and scope to significantly contribute to the educational program of the eligible institutions; and
<br>
<br>(12) limit loan collateralization, with respect to any loan made under this part, to 100 percent of the loan amount, except as otherwise required by the Secretary.
<br>(c) Additional agreement provisions
<br>
<br>Any insurance agreement described in subsection (a) of this section shall provide as follows:
<br>
<br>(1) The payment of principal and interest on bonds shall be insured by the Secretary until such time as such bonds have been retired or canceled.
<br>

<br>
<br>(3) The Secretary shall create a letter of credit authorizing the Department of the Treasury to disburse funds to the designated bonding authority or its assignee.
<br>
<br>(4) The letter of credit shall be drawn upon in the amount determined by paragraph (5) of this subsection upon the certification of the designated bonding authority to the Secretary or the Secretary's designee that there is a delinquency on 1 or more loans and there are insufficient funds available from loan repayments and the escrow account to make a scheduled payment of principal and interest on the bonds.
<br>
<br>(5) Upon receipt by the Secretary or the Secretary's designee of the certification described in paragraph (4) of this subsection, the designated bonding authority may draw a funding under the letter of credit in an amount equal to—
<br>
<br>(A) the amount required to make the next scheduled payment of principal and interest on the bonds, less
<br>
<br>(B) the amount available to the designated bonding authority from loan repayments and the escrow account.
<br>
<br>(6) All funds provided under the letter of credit shall be paid to the designated bonding authority within 2 business days following receipt of the certification described in paragraph (4).
<br>(d) Full faith and credit provisions

<br>(e) Sale of qualified bonds
<br>

<br>§1067. Findings
<br>
<br>Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>(1) It is incumbent on the Federal Government to support the technological and economic competitiveness of the United States by improving and expanding the scientific and technological capacity of the United States. More and better prepared scientists, engineers, and technical experts are needed to improve and expand such capacity.
<br>
<br>(2) As the Nation's population becomes more diverse, it is important that the educational and training needs of all Americans are met. Underrepresentation of minorities in science and technological fields diminishes our Nation's competitiveness by impairing the quantity of well prepared scientists, engineers, and technical experts in these fields.
<br>
<br>(3) Despite significant limitations in resources, minority institutions provide an important educational opportunity for minority students, particularly in science and engineering fields. Aid to minority institutions is a good way to address the underrepresentation of minorities in science and technological fields.
<br>
<br>(4) There is a strong Federal interest in improving science and engineering programs at minority institutions as such programs lag behind in program offerings and in student enrollment compared to such programs at other institutions of higher education.
