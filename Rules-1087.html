<br>
<br>(C) Class III, Premarket Approval.—A device which because—
<br>
<br>(i) it (I) cannot be classified as a class I device because insufficient information exists to determine that the application of general controls are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device, and (II) cannot be classified as a class II device because insufficient information exists to determine that the special controls described in subparagraph (B) would provide reasonable assurance of its safety and effectiveness, and
<br>
<br>(ii)(I) is purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life or for a use which is of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or
<br>
<br>(II) presents a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury,
<br>
<br>is to be subject, in accordance with section 360e of this title, to premarket approval to provide reasonable assurance of its safety and effectiveness.
<br>
<br>If there is not sufficient information to establish a performance standard for a device to provide reasonable assurance of its safety and effectiveness, the Secretary may conduct such activities as may be necessary to develop or obtain such information.
<br>
<br>(2) For purposes of this section and sections 360d and 360e of this title, the safety and effectiveness of a device are to be determined—
<br>
<br>(A) with respect to the persons for whose use the device is represented or intended,
<br>
<br>(B) with respect to the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling of the device, and
<br>
<br>(C) weighing any probable benefit to health from the use of the device against any probable risk of injury or illness from such use.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) Except as authorized by subparagraph (B), the effectiveness of a device is, for purposes of this section and sections 360d and 360e of this title, to be determined, in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary, on the basis of well-controlled investigations, including 1 or more clinical investigations where appropriate, by experts qualified by training and experience to evaluate the effectiveness of the device, from which investigations it can fairly and responsibly be concluded by qualified experts that the device will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling of the device.
<br>
<br>(B) If the Secretary determines that there exists valid scientific evidence (other than evidence derived from investigations described in subparagraph (A))—
<br>
<br>(i) which is sufficient to determine the effectiveness of a device, and
<br>
<br>(ii) from which it can fairly and responsibly be concluded by qualified experts that the device will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling of the device,
<br>
<br>then, for purposes of this section and sections 360d and 360e of this title, the Secretary may authorize the effectiveness of the device to be determined on the basis of such evidence.
<br>
<br>(C) In making a determination of a reasonable assurance of the effectiveness of a device for which an application under section 360e of this title has been submitted, the Secretary shall consider whether the extent of data that otherwise would be required for approval of the application with respect to effectiveness can be reduced through reliance on postmarket controls.
<br>
<br>(D)(i) The Secretary, upon the written request of any person intending to submit an application under section 360e of this title, shall meet with such person to determine the type of valid scientific evidence (within the meaning of subparagraphs (A) and (B)) that will be necessary to demonstrate for purposes of approval of an application the effectiveness of a device for the conditions of use proposed by such person. The written request shall include a detailed description of the device, a detailed description of the proposed conditions of use of the device, a proposed plan for determining whether there is a reasonable assurance of effectiveness, and, if available, information regarding the expected performance from the device. Within 30 days after such meeting, the Secretary shall specify in writing the type of valid scientific evidence that will provide a reasonable assurance that a device is effective under the conditions of use proposed by such person.
<br>
<br>(ii) Any clinical data, including one or more well-controlled investigations, specified in writing by the Secretary for demonstrating a reasonable assurance of device effectiveness shall be specified as result of a determination by the Secretary that such data are necessary to establish device effectiveness. The Secretary shall consider, in consultation with the applicant, the least burdensome appropriate means of evaluating device effectiveness that would have a reasonable likelihood of resulting in approval.
<br>
<br>(iii) For purposes of clause (ii), the term "necessary" means the minimum required information that would support a determination by the Secretary that an application provides reasonable assurance of the effectiveness of the device.
<br>
<br>(iv) Nothing in this subparagraph shall alter the criteria for evaluating an application for premarket approval of a device.
<br>
<br>(v) The determination of the Secretary with respect to the specification of valid scientific evidence under clauses (i) and (ii) shall be binding upon the Secretary, unless such determination by the Secretary could be contrary to the public health.
<br>(b) Classification panels
<br>
<br>(1) For purposes of—
<br>
<br>(A) determining which devices intended for human use should be subject to the requirements of general controls, performance standards, or premarket approval, and
<br>
<br>(B) providing notice to the manufacturers and importers of such devices to enable them to prepare for the application of such requirements to devices manufactured or imported by them,
<br>
<br>the Secretary shall classify all such devices (other than devices classified by subsection (f)) into the classes established by subsection (a). For the purpose of securing recommendations with respect to the classification of devices, the Secretary shall establish panels of experts or use panels of experts established before May 28, 1976, or both. Section 14 of the Federal Advisory Committee Act shall not apply to the duration of a panel established under this paragraph.
<br>
<br>(2) The Secretary shall appoint to each panel established under paragraph (1) persons who are qualified by training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the devices to be referred to the panel and who, to the extent feasible, possess skill in the use of, or experience in the development, manufacture, or utilization of, such devices. The Secretary shall make appointments to each panel so that each panel shall consist of members with adequately diversified expertise in such fields as clinical and administrative medicine, engineering, biological and physical sciences, and other related professions. In addition, each panel shall include as nonvoting members a representative of consumer interests and a representative of interests of the device manufacturing industry. Scientific, trade, and consumer organizations shall be afforded an opportunity to nominate individuals for appointment to the panels. No individual who is in the regular full-time employ of the United States and engaged in the administration of this chapter may be a member of any panel. The Secretary shall designate one of the members of each panel to serve as chairman thereof.
<br>
<br>(3) Panel members (other than officers or employees of the United States), while attending meetings or conferences of a panel or otherwise engaged in its business, shall be entitled to receive compensation at rates to be fixed by the Secretary, but not at rates exceeding the daily equivalent of the rate in effect for grade GS–18 of the General Schedule, for each day so engaged, including traveltime; and while so serving away from their homes or regular places of business each member may be allowed travel expenses (including per diem in lieu of subsistence) as authorized by section 5703 of title 5, for persons in the Government service employed intermittently.
<br>
<br>(4) The Secretary shall furnish each panel with adequate clerical and other necessary assistance.
<br>
<br>(5)(A) Classification panels covering each type of device shall be scheduled to meet at such times as may be appropriate for the Secretary to meet applicable statutory deadlines.
<br>
<br>(B) When a device is specifically the subject of review by a classification panel, the Secretary shall—
<br>
<br>(i) ensure that adequate expertise is represented on the classification panel to assess—
<br>
<br>(I) the disease or condition which the device is intended to cure, treat, mitigate, prevent, or diagnose; and
<br>
<br>(II) the technology of the device; and
<br>
<br>(ii) provide an opportunity for the person whose device is specifically the subject of panel review to provide recommendations on the expertise needed among the voting members of the panel.
<br>
<br>(C) For purposes of subparagraph (B)(i), the term "adequate expertise" means that the membership of the classification panel includes—
<br>
<br>(i) two or more voting members, with a specialty or other expertise clinically relevant to the device under review; and
<br>
<br>(ii) at least one voting member who is knowledgeable about the technology of the device.
<br>
<br>(D) The Secretary shall provide an annual opportunity for patients, representatives of patients, and sponsors of medical devices that may be specifically the subject of a review by a classification panel to provide recommendations for individuals with appropriate expertise to fill voting member positions on classification panels.
<br>
<br>(6)(A) Any person whose device is specifically the subject of review by a classification panel shall have—
<br>
<br>(i) the same access to data and information submitted to a classification panel (except for data and information that are not available for public disclosure under section 552 of title 5) as the Secretary;
<br>
<br>(ii) the opportunity to submit, for review by a classification panel, information that is based on the data or information provided in the application submitted under section 360e of this title by the person, which information shall be submitted to the Secretary for prompt transmittal to the classification panel; and
<br>
<br>(iii) the same opportunity as the Secretary to participate in meetings of the panel, including, subject to the discretion of the panel chairperson, by designating a representative who will be provided a time during the panel meeting to address the panel for the purpose of correcting misstatements of fact or providing clarifying information, and permitting the person or representative to call on experts within the person's organization to address such specific issues in the time provided.
<br>
<br>(B)(i) Any meeting of a classification panel with respect to the review of a device shall—
<br>
<br>(I) provide adequate time for initial presentations by the person whose device is specifically the subject of such review and by the Secretary; and
<br>
<br>(II) encourage free and open participation by all interested persons.
<br>
<br>(ii) Following the initial presentations described in clause (i), the panel may—
<br>
<br>(I) pose questions to a designated representative described in subparagraph (A)(iii); and
<br>
<br>(II) consider the responses to such questions in the panel's review of the device.
<br>
<br>(7) After receiving from a classification panel the conclusions and recommendations of the panel on a matter that the panel has reviewed, the Secretary shall review the conclusions and recommendations, shall make a final decision on the matter in accordance with section 360e(d)(2) of this title, and shall notify the affected persons of the decision in writing and, if the decision differs from the conclusions and recommendations of the panel, shall include the reasons for the difference.
<br>
<br>(8) A classification panel under this subsection shall not be subject to the annual chartering and annual report requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act.
<br>(c) Classification panel organization and operation
<br>
<br>(1) The Secretary shall organize the panels according to the various fields of clinical medicine and fundamental sciences in which devices intended for human use are used. The Secretary shall refer a device to be classified under this section to an appropriate panel established or authorized to be used under subsection (b) for its review and for its recommendation respecting the classification of the device. The Secretary shall by regulation prescribe the procedure to be followed by the panels in making their reviews and recommendations. In making their reviews of devices, the panels, to the maximum extent practicable, shall provide an opportunity for interested persons to submit data and views on the classification of the devices.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) Upon completion of a panel's review of a device referred to it under paragraph (1), the panel shall, subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C), submit to the Secretary its recommendation for the classification of the device. Any such recommendation shall (i) contain (I) a summary of the reasons for the recommendation, (II) a summary of the data upon which the recommendation is based, and (III) an identification of the risks to health (if any) presented by the device with respect to which the recommendation is made, and (ii) to the extent practicable, include a recommendation for the assignment of a priority for the application of the requirements of section 360d or 360e of this title to a device recommended to be classified in class II or class III.
<br>
<br>(B) A recommendation of a panel for the classification of a device in class I shall include a recommendation as to whether the device should be exempted from the requirements of section 360, 360i, or 360j(f) of this title.
<br>
<br>(C) In the case of a device which has been referred under paragraph (1) to a panel, and which—
<br>
<br>(i) is intended to be implanted in the human body or is purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life, and
<br>
<br>(ii)(I) has been introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce for commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, or
<br>
<br>(II) is within a type of device which was so introduced or delivered before such date and is substantially equivalent to another device within that type,
<br>
<br>such panel shall recommend to the Secretary that the device be classified in class III unless the panel determines that classification of the device in such class is not necessary to provide reasonable assurance of its safety and effectiveness. If a panel does not recommend that such a device be classified in class III, it shall in its recommendation to the Secretary for the classification of the device set forth the reasons for not recommending classification of the device in such class.
<br>
<br>(3) The panels shall submit to the Secretary within one year of the date funds are first appropriated for the implementation of this section their recommendations respecting all devices of a type introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce for commercial distribution before May 28, 1976.
<br>(d) Panel recommendation; publication; priorities
<br>
<br>(1) Upon receipt of a recommendation from a panel respecting a device, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register the panel's recommendation and a proposed regulation classifying such device and shall provide interested persons an opportunity to submit comments on such recommendation and the proposed regulation. After reviewing such comments, the Secretary shall, subject to paragraph (2), by regulation classify such device.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) A regulation under paragraph (1) classifying a device in class I shall prescribe which, if any, of the requirements of section 360, 360i, or 360j(f) of this title shall not apply to the device. A regulation which makes a requirement of section 360, 360i, or 360j(f) of this title inapplicable to a device shall be accompanied by a statement of the reasons of the Secretary for making such requirement inapplicable.
<br>
<br>(B) A device described in subsection (c)(2)(C) shall be classified in class III unless the Secretary determines that classification of the device in such class is not necessary to provide reasonable assurance of its safety and effectiveness. A proposed regulation under paragraph (1) classifying such a device in a class other than class III shall be accompanied by a full statement of the reasons of the Secretary (and supporting documentation and data) for not classifying such device in such class and an identification of the risks to health (if any) presented by such device.
<br>
<br>(3) In the case of devices classified in class II and devices classified under this subsection in class III and described in section 360e(b)(1) of this title the Secretary may establish priorities which, in his discretion, shall be used in applying sections 360d and 360e of this title, as appropriate, to such devices.
<br>(e) Classification changes
<br>
<br>(1)(A)(i) Based on new information respecting a device, the Secretary may, upon the initiative of the Secretary or upon petition of an interested person, change the classification of such device, and revoke, on account of the change in classification, any regulation or requirement in effect under section 360d or 360e of this title with respect to such device, by administrative order published in the Federal Register following publication of a proposed reclassification order in the Federal Register, a meeting of a device classification panel described in subsection (b), and consideration of comments to a public docket, notwithstanding subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5. The proposed reclassification order published in the Federal Register shall set forth the proposed reclassification, and a substantive summary of the valid scientific evidence concerning the proposed reclassification, including—
<br>
<br>(I) the public health benefit of the use of the device, and the nature and, if known, incidence of the risk of the device;
<br>
<br>(II) in the case of a reclassification from class II to class III, why general controls pursuant to subsection (a)(1)(A) and special controls pursuant to subsection (a)(1)(B) together are not sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for such device; and
<br>
<br>(III) in the case of reclassification from class III to class II, why general controls pursuant to subsection (a)(1)(A) and special controls pursuant to subsection (a)(1)(B) together are sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for such device.
<br>
<br>(ii) An order under this subsection changing the classification of a device from class III to class II may provide that such classification shall not take effect until the effective date of a performance standard established under section 360d of this title for such device.
<br>
<br>(B) Authority to issue such administrative order shall not be delegated below the Director of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, acting in consultation with the Commissioner.
<br>
<br>(2) By an order issued under paragraph (1), the Secretary may change the classification of a device from class III—
<br>
<br>(A) to class II if the Secretary determines that special controls would provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device and that general controls would not provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device, or
<br>
<br>(B) to class I if the Secretary determines that general controls would provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device.
<br>(f) Initial classification and reclassification of certain devices
<br>
<br>(1) Any device intended for human use which was not introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce for commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, is classified in class III unless—
<br>
<br>(A) the device—
<br>
<br>(i) is within a type of device (I) which was introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce for commercial distribution before such date and which is to be classified pursuant to subsection (b), or (II) which was not so introduced or delivered before such date and has been classified in class I or II, and
<br>
<br>(ii) is substantially equivalent to another device within such type;
<br>
<br>(B) the Secretary in response to a petition submitted under paragraph (3) has classified such device in class I or II; or
<br>
<br>(C) the device is classified pursuant to a request submitted under paragraph (2).
<br>
<br>A device classified in class III under this paragraph shall be classified in that class until the effective date of an order of the Secretary under paragraph (2) or (3) classifying the device in class I or II.
<br>
<br>(2)(A)(i) Any person who submits a report under section 360(k) of this title for a type of device that has not been previously classified under this chapter, and that is classified into class III under paragraph (1), may request, after receiving written notice of such a classification, the Secretary to classify the device.
<br>
<br>(ii) In lieu of submitting a report under section 360(k) of this title and submitting a request for classification under clause (i) for a device, if a person determines there is no legally marketed device upon which to base a determination of substantial equivalence (as defined in subsection (i)), a person may submit a request under this clause for the Secretary to classify the device.
<br>
<br>(iii) Upon receipt of a request under clause (i) or (ii), the Secretary shall classify the device subject to the request under the criteria set forth in subparagraphs (A) through (C) of subsection (a)(1) within 120 days.
<br>
<br>(iv) Notwithstanding clause (iii), the Secretary may decline to undertake a classification request submitted under clause (ii) if the Secretary identifies a legally marketed device that could provide a reasonable basis for review of substantial equivalence under paragraph (1), or when the Secretary determines that the device submitted is not of low to moderate risk or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls to mitigate the risks cannot be developed.
<br>
<br>(v) The person submitting the request for classification under this subparagraph may recommend to the Secretary a classification for the device and shall, if recommending classification in class II, include in the request an initial draft proposal for applicable special controls, as described in subsection (a)(1)(B), that are necessary, in conjunction with general controls, to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness and a description of how the special controls provide such assurance. Any such request shall describe the device and provide detailed information and reasons for the recommended classification.
<br>
<br>(B)(i) The Secretary shall by written order classify the device involved. Such classification shall be the initial classification of the device for purposes of paragraph (1) and any device classified under this paragraph shall be a predicate device for determining substantial equivalence under paragraph (1).
<br>
<br>(ii) A device that remains in class III under this subparagraph shall be deemed to be adulterated within the meaning of section 351(f)(1)(B) of this title until approved under section 360e of this title or exempted from such approval under section 360j(g) of this title.
<br>
<br>(C) Within 30 days after the issuance of an order classifying a device under this paragraph, the Secretary shall publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing such classification.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) The Secretary may initiate the reclassification of a device classified into class III under paragraph (1) of this subsection or the manufacturer or importer of a device classified under paragraph (1) may petition the Secretary (in such form and manner as he shall prescribe) for the issuance of an order classifying the device in class I or class II. Within thirty days of the filing of such a petition, the Secretary shall notify the petitioner of any deficiencies in the petition which prevent the Secretary from making a decision on the petition.
<br>
<br>(B)(i) Upon determining that a petition does not contain any deficiency which prevents the Secretary from making a decision on the petition, the Secretary may for good cause shown refer the petition to an appropriate panel established or authorized to be used under subsection (b). A panel to which such a petition has been referred shall not later than ninety days after the referral of the petition make a recommendation to the Secretary respecting approval or denial of the petition. Any such recommendation shall contain (I) a summary of the reasons for the recommendation, (II) a summary of the data upon which the recommendation is based, and (III) an identification of the risks to health (if any) presented by the device with respect to which the petition was filed. In the case of a petition for a device which is intended to be implanted in the human body or which is purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life, the panel shall recommend that the petition be denied unless the panel determines that the classification in class III of the device is not necessary to provide reasonable assurance of its safety and effectiveness. If the panel recommends that such petition be approved, it shall in its recommendation to the Secretary set forth its reasons for such recommendation.
<br>
<br>(ii) The requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (c) (relating to opportunities for submission of data and views and recommendations respecting priorities and exemptions from sections 360, 360i, and 360j(f) of this title) shall apply with respect to consideration by panels of petitions submitted under subparagraph (A).
<br>
<br>(C)(i) Within ninety days from the date the Secretary receives the recommendation of a panel respecting a petition (but not later than 210 days after the filing of such petition) the Secretary shall by order deny or approve the petition. If the Secretary approves the petition, the Secretary shall order the classification of the device into class I or class II in accordance with the criteria prescribed by subsection (a)(1)(A) or (a)(1)(B). In the case of a petition for a device which is intended to be implanted in the human body or which is purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life, the Secretary shall deny the petition unless the Secretary determines that the classification in class III of the device is not necessary to provide reasonable assurance of its safety and effectiveness. An order approving such petition shall be accompanied by a full statement of the reasons of the Secretary (and supporting documentation and data) for approving the petition and an identification of the risks to health (if any) presented by the device to which such order applies.
<br>
<br>(ii) The requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2)(A) of subsection (d) (relating to publication of recommendations, opportunity for submission of comments, and exemption from sections 360, 360i, and 360j(f) of this title) shall apply with respect to action by the Secretary on petitions submitted under subparagraph (A).
<br>
<br>(4) If a manufacturer reports to the Secretary under section 360(k) of this title that a device is substantially equivalent to another device—
<br>
<br>(A) which the Secretary has classified as a class III device under subsection (b),
<br>
<br>(B) which was introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce for commercial distribution before December 1, 1990, and
<br>
<br>(C) for which no final regulation requiring premarket approval has been promulgated under section 360e(b) of this title,
<br>
<br>the manufacturer shall certify to the Secretary that the manufacturer has conducted a reasonable search of all information known or otherwise available to the manufacturer respecting such other device and has included in the report under section 360(k) of this title a summary of and a citation to all adverse safety and effectiveness data respecting such other device and respecting the device for which the section 360(k) report is being made and which has not been submitted to the Secretary under section 360i of this title. The Secretary may require the manufacturer to submit the adverse safety and effectiveness data described in the report.
<br>
<br>(5) The Secretary may not withhold a determination of the initial classification of a device under paragraph (1) because of a failure to comply with any provision of this chapter unrelated to a substantial equivalence decision, including a finding that the facility in which the device is manufactured is not in compliance with good manufacturing requirements as set forth in regulations of the Secretary under section 360j(f) of this title (other than a finding that there is a substantial likelihood that the failure to comply with such regulations will potentially present a serious risk to human health).
<br>
<br>(6)(A) Subject to the succeeding subparagraphs of this paragraph, the Secretary shall, by written order, classify an accessory under this section based on the risks of the accessory when used as intended and the level of regulatory controls necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the accessory, notwithstanding the classification of any other device with which such accessory is intended to be used.
<br>
<br>(B) The classification of any accessory distinct from another device by regulation or written order issued prior to December 13, 2016, shall continue to apply unless and until the accessory is reclassified by the Secretary, notwithstanding the classification of any other device with which such accessory is intended to be used. Nothing in this paragraph shall preclude the Secretary's authority to initiate the classification of an accessory through regulation or written order, as appropriate.
<br>
<br>(C)(i) In the case of a device intended to be used with an accessory, where the accessory has been included in an application for premarket approval of such device under section 360e of this title or a report under section 360(k) of this title for clearance of such device and the Secretary has not classified such accessory distinctly from another device in accordance with subparagraph (A), the person filing the application or report (as applicable) at the time such application or report is filed—
<br>
<br>(I) may include a written request for the proper classification of the accessory pursuant to subparagraph (A);
<br>
<br>(II) shall include in any such request such information as may be necessary for the Secretary to evaluate, based on the least burdensome approach, the appropriate class for the accessory under subsection (a); and
<br>
<br>(III) shall, if the request under subclause (I) is requesting classification of the accessory in class II, include in the application an initial draft proposal for special controls, if special controls would be required pursuant to subsection (a)(1)(B).
<br>
<br>(ii) The Secretary's response under section 360e(d) or section 360(n) of this title (as applicable) to an application or report described in clause (i) shall also contain the Secretary's granting or denial of the request for classification of the accessory involved.
<br>
<br>(iii) The Secretary's evaluation of an accessory under clause (i) shall constitute an order establishing a new classification for such accessory for the specified intended use or uses of such accessory and for any accessory with the same intended use or uses as such accessory.
<br>
<br>(D) For accessories that have been granted marketing authorization as part of a submission for another device with which the accessory involved is intended to be used, through an application for such other device under section 360e(c) of this title, a report under section 360(k) of this title, or a request for classification under paragraph (2) of this subsection, the following shall apply:
<br>
<br>(i) Not later than the date that is one year after August 18, 2017, and at least once every 5 years thereafter, and as the Secretary otherwise determines appropriate, pursuant to this paragraph, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a notice proposing a list of such accessories that the Secretary determines may be suitable for a distinct classification in class I and the proposed regulations for such classifications. In developing such list, the Secretary shall consider recommendations from sponsors of device submissions and other stakeholders for accessories to be included on such list. The notices shall provide for a period of not less than 60 calendar days for public comment. Within 180 days after the end of the comment period, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a final action classifying such suitable accessories into class I.
<br>
<br>(ii) A manufacturer or importer of an accessory that has been granted such marketing authorization may submit to the Secretary a written request for the appropriate classification of the accessory based on the risks and appropriate level of regulatory controls as described in subparagraph (A), and shall, if the request is requesting classification of the accessory in class II, include in the submission an initial draft proposal for special controls, if special controls would be required pursuant to subsection (a)(1)(B). Such request shall include such information as may be necessary for the Secretary to evaluate, based on the least burdensome approach, the appropriate class for the accessory under subsection (a). The Secretary shall provide an opportunity for a manufacturer or importer to meet with appropriate personnel of the Food and Drug Administration to discuss the appropriate classification of such accessory prior to submitting a written request under this clause for classification of the accessory.
<br>
<br>(iii) The Secretary shall respond to a request made under clause (ii) not later than 85 calendar days after receiving such request by issuing a written order classifying the accessory or denying the request. If the Secretary does not agree with the recommendation for classification submitted by the manufacturer or importer, the response shall include a detailed description and justification for such determination. Within 30 calendar days after granting such a request, the Secretary shall publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing such response.
<br>
<br>(E) Nothing in this paragraph may be construed as precluding a manufacturer of an accessory of a new type from using the classification process described in subsection (f)(2) to obtain classification of such accessory in accordance with the criteria and requirements set forth in that subsection.
<br>(g) Information
<br>
<br>Within sixty days of the receipt of a written request of any person for information respecting the class in which a device has been classified or the requirements applicable to a device under this chapter, the Secretary shall provide such person a written statement of the classification (if any) of such device and the requirements of this chapter applicable to the device.

<br>(1)(A) For purposes of determinations of substantial equivalence under subsection (f) and section 360j(l) of this title, the term "substantially equivalent" or "substantial equivalence" means, with respect to a device being compared to a predicate device, that the device has the same intended use as the predicate device and that the Secretary by order has found that the device—
<br>
<br>(i) has the same technological characteristics as the predicate device, or
<br>
<br>(ii)(I) has different technological characteristics and the information submitted that the device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device contains information, including appropriate clinical or scientific data if deemed necessary by the Secretary or a person accredited under section 360m of this title, that demonstrates that the device is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device, and (II) does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than the predicate device.
<br>
<br>(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term "different technological characteristics" means, with respect to a device being compared to a predicate device, that there is a significant change in the materials, design, energy source, or other features of the device from those of the predicate device.
<br>
<br>(C) To facilitate reviews of reports submitted to the Secretary under section 360(k) of this title, the Secretary shall consider the extent to which reliance on postmarket controls may expedite the classification of devices under subsection (f)(1) of this section.
<br>
<br>(D)(i) Whenever the Secretary requests information to demonstrate that devices with differing technological characteristics are substantially equivalent, the Secretary shall only request information that is necessary to making substantial equivalence determinations. In making such request, the Secretary shall consider the least burdensome means of demonstrating substantial equivalence and request information accordingly.
<br>
<br>(ii) For purposes of clause (i), the term "necessary" means the minimum required information that would support a determination of substantial equivalence between a new device and a predicate device.
<br>
<br>(iii) Nothing in this subparagraph shall alter the standard for determining substantial equivalence between a new device and a predicate device.
<br>
<br>(E)(i) Any determination by the Secretary of the intended use of a device shall be based upon the proposed labeling submitted in a report for the device under section 360(k) of this title. However, when determining that a device can be found substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device, the director of the organizational unit responsible for regulating devices (in this subparagraph referred to as the "Director") may require a statement in labeling that provides appropriate information regarding a use of the device not identified in the proposed labeling if, after providing an opportunity for consultation with the person who submitted such report, the Director determines and states in writing—
<br>
<br>(I) that there is a reasonable likelihood that the device will be used for an intended use not identified in the proposed labeling for the device; and
<br>
<br>(II) that such use could cause harm.
<br>
<br>(ii) Such determination shall—
<br>
<br>(I) be provided to the person who submitted the report within 10 days from the date of the notification of the Director's concerns regarding the proposed labeling;
<br>
<br>(II) specify the limitations on the use of the device not included in the proposed labeling; and
<br>
<br>(III) find the device substantially equivalent if the requirements of subparagraph (A) are met and if the labeling for such device conforms to the limitations specified in subclause (II).
<br>
<br>(iii) The responsibilities of the Director under this subparagraph may not be delegated.
<br>
<br>(F) Not later than 270 days after November 21, 1997, the Secretary shall issue guidance specifying the general principles that the Secretary will consider in determining when a specific intended use of a device is not reasonably included within a general use of such device for purposes of a determination of substantial equivalence under subsection (f) or section 360j(l) of this title.
<br>
<br>(2) A device may not be found to be substantially equivalent to a predicate device that has been removed from the market at the initiative of the Secretary or that has been determined to be misbranded or adulterated by a judicial order.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) As part of a submission under section 360(k) of this title respecting a device, the person required to file a premarket notification under such section shall provide an adequate summary of any information respecting safety and effectiveness or state that such information will be made available upon request by any person.
<br>
<br>(B) Any summary under subparagraph (A) respecting a device shall contain detailed information regarding data concerning adverse health effects and shall be made available to the public by the Secretary within 30 days of the issuance of a determination that such device is substantially equivalent to another device.
<br>(j) Training and oversight of least burdensome requirements
<br>(1) The Secretary shall—
<br>
<br>(A) ensure that each employee of the Food and Drug Administration who is involved in the review of premarket submissions, including supervisors, receives training regarding the meaning and implementation of the least burdensome requirements under subsections (a)(3)(D) and (i)(1)(D) of this section and section 360e(c)(5) of this title; and
<br>
<br>(B) periodically assess the implementation of the least burdensome requirements, including the employee training under subparagraph (A), to ensure that the least burdensome requirements are fully and consistently applied.
<br>(2) Not later than 18 months after December 13, 2016, the ombudsman for any organizational unit of the Food and Drug Administration responsible for the premarket review of devices shall—
<br>
<br>(A) conduct an audit of the training described in paragraph (1)(A), including the effectiveness of such training in implementing the least burdensome requirements;
<br>
<br>(B) include in such audit interviews of persons who are representatives of the device industry regarding their experiences in the device premarket review process, including with respect to the application of least burdensome concepts to premarket review and decisionmaking;
<br>
<br>(C) include in such audit a list of the measurement tools the Secretary uses to assess the implementation of the least burdensome requirements, including under paragraph (1)(B) and section 360g–1(a)(3) of this title, and may also provide feedback on the effectiveness of such tools in the implementation of the least burdensome requirements;
<br>
<br>(D) summarize the findings of such audit in a final audit report; and
<br>
<br>(E) within 30 calendar days of completion of such final audit report, make such final audit report available—
<br>
<br>(i) to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives; and
<br>
<br>(ii) on the Internet website of the Food and Drug Administration.

<br>(b) Establishment of a standard
<br>
<br>(1)(A) The Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking for the establishment, amendment, or revocation of any performance standard for a device.
<br>
<br>(B) A notice of proposed rulemaking for the establishment or amendment of a performance standard for a device shall—
<br>
<br>(i) set forth a finding with supporting justification that the performance standard is appropriate and necessary to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device,
<br>
<br>(ii) set forth proposed findings with respect to the risk of illness or injury that the performance standard is intended to reduce or eliminate,
<br>
<br>(iii) invite interested persons to submit to the Secretary, within 30 days of the publication of the notice, requests for changes in the classification of the device pursuant to section 360c(e) of this title based on new information relevant to the classification, and
<br>
<br>(iv) invite interested persons to submit an existing performance standard for the device, including a draft or proposed performance standard, for consideration by the Secretary.
<br>
<br>(C) A notice of proposed rulemaking for the revocation of a performance standard shall set forth a finding with supporting justification that the performance standard is no longer necessary to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of a device.
<br>
<br>(D) The Secretary shall provide for a comment period of not less than 60 days.
<br>
<br>(2) If, after publication of a notice in accordance with paragraph (1), the Secretary receives a request for a change in the classification of the device, the Secretary shall, within 60 days of the publication of the notice, after consultation with the appropriate panel under section 360c of this title, either deny the request or give notice of an intent to initiate such change under section 360c(e) of this title.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) After the expiration of the period for comment on a notice of proposed rulemaking published under paragraph (1) respecting a performance standard and after consideration of such comments and any report from an advisory committee under paragraph (5), the Secretary shall (i) promulgate a regulation establishing a performance standard and publish in the Federal Register findings on the matters referred to in paragraph (1), or (ii) publish a notice terminating the proceeding for the development of the standard together with the reasons for such termination. If a notice of termination is published, the Secretary shall (unless such notice is issued because the device is a banned device under section 360f of this title) initiate a proceeding under section 360c(e) of this title to reclassify the device subject to the proceeding terminated by such notice.
<br>
<br>(B) A regulation establishing a performance standard shall set forth the date or dates upon which the standard shall take effect, but no such regulation may take effect before one year after the date of its publication unless (i) the Secretary determines that an earlier effective date is necessary for the protection of the public health and safety, or (ii) such standard has been established for a device which, effective upon the effective date of the standard, has been reclassified from class III to class II. Such date or dates shall be established so as to minimize, consistent with the public health and safety, economic loss to, and disruption or dislocation of, domestic and international trade.
<br>
<br>(4)(A) The Secretary, upon his own initiative or upon petition of an interested person may by regulation, promulgated in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (1), (2), and (3)(B) of this subsection, amend or revoke a performance standard.
<br>
<br>(B) The Secretary may declare a proposed amendment of a performance standard to be effective on and after its publication in the Federal Register and until the effective date of any final action taken on such amendment if he determines that making it so effective is in the public interest. A proposed amendment of a performance standard made so effective under the preceding sentence may not prohibit, during the period in which it is so effective, the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of a device which conforms to such standard without the change or changes provided by such proposed amendment.
<br>

<br>
<br>(i) may on his own initiative refer a proposed regulation for the establishment, amendment, or revocation of a performance standard, or
<br>
<br>(ii) shall, upon the request of an interested person which demonstrates good cause for referral and which is made before the expiration of the period for submission of comments on such proposed regulation refer such proposed regulation,
<br>
<br>to an advisory committee of experts, established pursuant to subparagraph (B), for a report and recommendation with respect to any matter involved in the proposed regulation which requires the exercise of scientific judgment. If a proposed regulation is referred under this subparagraph to an advisory committee, the Secretary shall provide the advisory committee with the data and information on which such proposed regulation is based. The advisory committee shall, within sixty days of the referral of a proposed regulation and after independent study of the data and information furnished to it by the Secretary and other data and information before it, submit to the Secretary a report and recommendation respecting such regulation, together with all underlying data and information and a statement of the reason or basis for the recommendation. A copy of such report and recommendation shall be made public by the Secretary.
<br>
<br>(B) The Secretary shall establish advisory committees (which may not be panels under section 360c of this title) to receive referrals under subparagraph (A). The Secretary shall appoint as members of any such advisory committee persons qualified in the subject matter to be referred to the committee and of appropriately diversified professional background, except that the Secretary may not appoint to such a committee any individual who is in the regular full-time employ of the United States and engaged in the administration of this chapter.

<br>
<br>(3)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall accept a declaration of conformity that a device is in conformity with a standard recognized under paragraph (1) unless the Secretary finds—
<br>
<br>(i) that the data or information submitted to support such declaration does not demonstrate that the device is in conformity with the standard identified in the declaration of conformity; or
<br>
<br>(ii) that the standard identified in the declaration of conformity is not applicable to the particular device under review.
<br>
<br>(B) The Secretary may request, at any time, the data or information relied on by the person to make a declaration of conformity with respect to a standard recognized under paragraph (1).

<br>(D) an identifying reference to any performance standard under section 360d of this title which would be applicable to any aspect of such device if it were a class II device, and either adequate information to show that such aspect of such device fully meets such performance standard or adequate information to justify any deviation from such standard;
<br>
<br>(E) such samples of such device and of components thereof as the Secretary may reasonably require, except that where the submission of such samples is impracticable or unduly burdensome, the requirement of this subparagraph may be met by the submission of complete information concerning the location of one or more such devices readily available for examination and testing;
<br>
<br>(F) specimens of the labeling proposed to be used for such device;
<br>
<br>(G) the certification required under section 282(j)(5)(B) of title 42 (which shall not be considered an element of such application); and
<br>
<br>(H) such other information relevant to the subject matter of the application as the Secretary, with the concurrence of the appropriate panel under section 360c of this title, may require.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) Any person may file with the Secretary a report seeking premarket approval for a class III device referred to in subsection (a) that is a reprocessed single-use device. Such a report shall contain the following:

<br>
<br>(xi) Any additional data and information, including information of the type required in paragraph (1) for an application under such paragraph, that the Secretary determines is necessary to determine whether there is reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for the reprocessed device.
<br>
<br>(xii) Validation data described in section 360(o)(1)(A) of this title that demonstrates that the reasonable assurance of the safety or effectiveness of the device will remain after the maximum number of times the device is reprocessed as intended by the person submitting such report.
<br>
<br>(B) In the case of a class III device referred to in subsection (a) that is a reprocessed single-use device:
<br>
<br>(i) Subparagraph (A) of this paragraph applies in lieu of paragraph (1).
<br>
<br>(ii) Subject to clause (i), the provisions of this section apply to a report under subparagraph (A) to the same extent and in the same manner as such provisions apply to an application under paragraph (1).
<br>
<br>(iii) Each reference in other sections of this chapter to an application under this section, other than such a reference in section 379i or 379j of this title, shall be considered to be a reference to a report under subparagraph (A).
<br>
<br>(iv) Each reference in other sections of this chapter to a device for which an application under this section has been approved, or has been denied, suspended, or withdrawn, other than such a reference in section 379i or 379j of this title, shall be considered to be a reference to a device for which a report under subparagraph (A) has been approved, or has been denied, suspended, or withdrawn, respectively.
<br>
<br>(3) Upon receipt of an application meeting the requirements set forth in paragraph (1), the Secretary—
<br>
<br>(A) may on the Secretary's own initiative, or
<br>
<br>(B) shall, upon the request of an applicant unless the Secretary finds that the information in the application which would be reviewed by a panel substantially duplicates information which has previously been reviewed by a panel appointed under section 360c of this title,
<br>
<br>refer such application to the appropriate panel under section 360c of this title for study and for submission (within such period as he may establish) of a report and recommendation respecting approval of the application, together with all underlying data and the reasons or basis for the recommendation. Where appropriate, the Secretary shall ensure that such panel includes, or consults with, one or more pediatric experts.
<br>
<br>(4)(A) Prior to the submission of an application under this subsection, the Secretary shall accept and review any portion of the application that the applicant and the Secretary agree is complete, ready, and appropriate for review, except that such requirement does not apply, and the Secretary has discretion whether to accept and review such portion, during any period in which, under section 379j(g) of this title, the Secretary does not have the authority to collect fees under section 379j(a) of this title.
<br>
<br>(B) Each portion of a submission reviewed under subparagraph (A) and found acceptable by the Secretary shall not be further reviewed after receipt of an application that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (1), unless a significant issue of safety or effectiveness provides the Secretary reason to review such accepted portion.
<br>
<br>(C) Whenever the Secretary determines that a portion of a submission under subparagraph (A) is unacceptable, the Secretary shall, in writing, provide to the applicant a description of any deficiencies in such portion and identify the information that is required to correct these deficiencies, unless the applicant is no longer pursuing the application.
<br>
<br>(5)(A) In requesting additional information with respect to an application under this section, the Secretary shall consider the least burdensome appropriate means necessary to demonstrate a reasonable assurance of device safety and effectiveness.
<br>
<br>(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term "necessary" means the minimum required information that would support a determination by the Secretary that an application provides a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device.
<br>
<br>(C) For purposes of this paragraph, the Secretary shall consider the role of postmarket information in determining the least burdensome means of demonstrating a reasonable assurance of device safety and effectiveness.
<br>
<br>(D) Nothing in this paragraph alters the standards for premarket approval of a device.
<br>(d) Action on application for premarket approval
<br>
<br>(1)(A) As promptly as possible, but in no event later than one hundred and eighty days after the receipt of an application under subsection (c) (except as provided in section 360j(l)(3)(D)(ii) of this title or unless, in accordance with subparagraph (B)(i), an additional period as agreed upon by the Secretary and the applicant), the Secretary, after considering the report and recommendation submitted under paragraph (2) of such subsection, shall—
<br>
<br>(i) issue an order approving the application if he finds that none of the grounds for denying approval specified in paragraph (2) of this subsection applies; or
<br>
<br>(ii) deny approval of the application if he finds (and sets forth the basis for such finding as part of or accompanying such denial) that one or more grounds for denial specified in paragraph (2) of this subsection apply.
<br>
<br>In making the determination whether to approve or deny the application, the Secretary shall rely on the conditions of use included in the proposed labeling as the basis for determining whether or not there is a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, if the proposed labeling is neither false nor misleading. In determining whether or not such labeling is false or misleading, the Secretary shall fairly evaluate all material facts pertinent to the proposed labeling.
<br>
<br>(B)(i) The Secretary may not enter into an agreement to extend the period in which to take action with respect to an application submitted for a device subject to a regulation promulgated under subsection (b) unless he finds that the continued availability of the device is necessary for the public health.
<br>
<br>(ii) An order approving an application for a device may require as a condition to such approval that the sale and distribution of the device be restricted but only to the extent that the sale and distribution of a device may be restricted under a regulation under section 360j(e) of this title.
<br>
<br>(iii) The Secretary shall accept and review statistically valid and reliable data and any other information from investigations conducted under the authority of regulations required by section 360j(g) of this title to make a determination of whether there is a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of a device subject to a pending application under this section if—
<br>
<br>(I) the data or information is derived from investigations of an earlier version of the device, the device has been modified during or after the investigations (but prior to submission of an application under subsection (c)) and such a modification of the device does not constitute a significant change in the design or in the basic principles of operation of the device that would invalidate the data or information; or
<br>
<br>(II) the data or information relates to a device approved under this section, is available for use under this chapter, and is relevant to the design and intended use of the device for which the application is pending.
<br>
<br>(2) The Secretary shall deny approval of an application for a device if, upon the basis of the information submitted to the Secretary as part of the application and any other information before him with respect to such device, the Secretary finds that—
<br>
<br>(A) there is a lack of a showing of reasonable assurance that such device is safe under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling thereof;
<br>
<br>(B) there is a lack of a showing of reasonable assurance that the device is effective under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling thereof;
<br>
<br>(C) the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, the manufacture, processing, packing, or installation of such device do not conform to the requirements of section 360j(f) of this title;
<br>
<br>(D) based on a fair evaluation of all material facts, the proposed labeling is false or misleading in any particular; or
<br>
<br>(E) such device is not shown to conform in all respects to a performance standard in effect under section 360d of this title compliance with which is a condition to approval of the application and there is a lack of adequate information to justify the deviation from such standard.
<br>
<br>Any denial of an application shall, insofar as the Secretary determines to be practicable, be accompanied by a statement informing the applicant of the measures required to place such application in approvable form (which measures may include further research by the applicant in accordance with one or more protocols prescribed by the Secretary).
<br>
<br>(3)(A)(i) The Secretary shall, upon the written request of an applicant, meet with the applicant, not later than 100 days after the receipt of an application that has been filed as complete under subsection (c), to discuss the review status of the application.
<br>
<br>(ii) The Secretary shall, in writing and prior to the meeting, provide to the applicant a description of any deficiencies in the application that, at that point, have been identified by the Secretary based on an interim review of the entire application and identify the information that is required to correct those deficiencies.
<br>
<br>(iii) The Secretary shall notify the applicant promptly of—
<br>
<br>(I) any additional deficiency identified in the application, or
<br>
<br>(II) any additional information required to achieve completion of the review and final action on the application,
<br>
<br>that was not described as a deficiency in the written description provided by the Secretary under clause (ii).
<br>
<br>(B) The Secretary and the applicant may, by mutual consent, establish a different schedule for a meeting required under this paragraph.
<br>
<br>(4) An applicant whose application has been denied approval may, by petition filed on or before the thirtieth day after the date upon which he receives notice of such denial, obtain review thereof in accordance with either paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (g), and any interested person may obtain review, in accordance with paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (g), of an order of the Secretary approving an application.
<br>
<br>(5)(A)(i) A supplemental application shall be required for any change to a device subject to an approved application under this subsection that affects safety or effectiveness, unless such change is a modification in a manufacturing procedure or method of manufacturing and the holder of the approved application submits a written notice to the Secretary that describes in detail the change, summarizes the data or information supporting the change, and informs the Secretary that the change has been made under the requirements of section 360j(f) of this title.
<br>
<br>(ii) The holder of an approved application who submits a notice under clause (i) with respect to a manufacturing change of a device may distribute the device 30 days after the date on which the Secretary receives the notice, unless the Secretary within such 30-day period notifies the holder that the notice is not adequate and describes such further information or action that is required for acceptance of such change. If the Secretary notifies the holder that a supplemental application is required, the Secretary shall review the supplement within 135 days after the receipt of the supplement. The time used by the Secretary to review the notice of the manufacturing change shall be deducted from the 135-day review period if the notice meets appropriate content requirements for premarket approval supplements.
<br>
<br>(B)(i) Subject to clause (ii), in reviewing a supplement to an approved application, for an incremental change to the design of a device that affects safety or effectiveness, the Secretary shall approve such supplement if—
<br>
<br>(I) nonclinical data demonstrate that the design modification creates the intended additional capacity, function, or performance of the device; and
<br>
<br>(II) clinical data from the approved application and any supplement to the approved application provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for the changed device.
<br>
<br>(ii) The Secretary may require, when necessary, additional clinical data to evaluate the design modification of the device to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.
<br>(e) Withdrawal and temporary suspension of approval of application
<br>
<br>(1) The Secretary shall, upon obtaining, where appropriate, advice on scientific matters from a panel or panels under section 360c of this title, and after due notice and opportunity for informal hearing to the holder of an approved application for a device, issue an order withdrawing approval of the application if the Secretary finds—
<br>
<br>(A) that such device is unsafe or ineffective under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling thereof;
<br>
<br>(B) on the basis of new information before him with respect to such device, evaluated together with the evidence available to him when the application was approved, that there is a lack of a showing of reasonable assurance that the device is safe or effective under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling thereof;
<br>
<br>(C) that the application contained or was accompanied by an untrue statement of a material fact;
<br>
<br>(D) that the applicant (i) has failed to establish a system for maintaining records, or has repeatedly or deliberately failed to maintain records or to make reports, required by an applicable regulation under section 360i(a) of this title, (ii) has refused to permit access to, or copying or verification of, such records as required by section 374 of this title, or (iii) has not complied with the requirements of section 360 of this title;
<br>
<br>(E) on the basis of new information before him with respect to such device, evaluated together with the evidence before him when the application was approved, that the methods used in, or the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, packing, or installation of such device do not conform with the requirements of section 360j(f) of this title and were not brought into conformity with such requirements within a reasonable time after receipt of written notice from the Secretary of nonconformity;
<br>
<br>(F) on the basis of new information before him, evaluated together with the evidence before him when the application was approved, that the labeling of such device, based on a fair evaluation of all material facts, is false or misleading in any particular and was not corrected within a reasonable time after receipt of written notice from the Secretary of such fact; or
<br>
<br>(G) on the basis of new information before him, evaluated together with the evidence before him when the application was approved, that such device is not shown to conform in all respects to a performance standard which is in effect under section 360d of this title compliance with which was a condition to approval of the application and that there is a lack of adequate information to justify the deviation from such standard.
<br>
<br>(2) The holder of an application subject to an order issued under paragraph (1) withdrawing approval of the application may, by petition filed on or before the thirtieth day after the date upon which he receives notice of such withdrawal, obtain review thereof in accordance with either paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (g).
<br>
<br>(3) If, after providing an opportunity for an informal hearing, the Secretary determines there is reasonable probability that the continuation of distribution of a device under an approved application would cause serious, adverse health consequences or death, the Secretary shall by order temporarily suspend the approval of the application approved under this section. If the Secretary issues such an order, the Secretary shall proceed expeditiously under paragraph (1) to withdraw such application.
<br>(f) Product development protocol
<br>
<br>(1) In the case of a class III device which is required to have an approval of an application submitted under subsection (c), such device shall be considered as having such an approval if a notice of completion of testing conducted in accordance with a product development protocol approved under paragraph (4) has been declared completed under paragraph (6).
<br>
<br>(2) Any person may submit to the Secretary a proposed product development protocol with respect to a device. Such a protocol shall be accompanied by data supporting it. If, within thirty days of the receipt of such a protocol, the Secretary determines that it appears to be appropriate to apply the requirements of this subsection to the device with respect to which the protocol is submitted, the Secretary—
<br>
<br>(A) may, at the initiative of the Secretary, refer the proposed protocol to the appropriate panel under section 360c of this title for its recommendation respecting approval of the protocol; or
<br>
<br>(B) shall so refer such protocol upon the request of the submitter, unless the Secretary finds that the proposed protocol and accompanying data which would be reviewed by such panel substantially duplicate a product development protocol and accompanying data which have previously been reviewed by such a panel.
<br>
<br>(3) A proposed product development protocol for a device may be approved only if—
<br>
<br>(A) the Secretary determines that it is appropriate to apply the requirements of this subsection to the device in lieu of the requirement of approval of an application submitted under subsection (c); and
<br>
<br>(B) the Secretary determines that the proposed protocol provides—
<br>
<br>(i) a description of the device and the changes which may be made in the device,
<br>
<br>(ii) a description of the preclinical trials (if any) of the device and a specification of (I) the results from such trials to be required before the commencement of clinical trials of the device, and (II) any permissible variations in preclinical trials and the results therefrom,
<br>
<br>(iii) a description of the clinical trials (if any) of the device and a specification of (I) the results from such trials to be required before the filing of a notice of completion of the requirements of the protocol, and (II) any permissible variations in such trials and the results therefrom,
<br>
<br>(iv) a description of the methods to be used in, and the facilities and controls to be used for, the manufacture, processing, and, when relevant, packing and installation of the device,
<br>
<br>(v) an identifying reference to any performance standard under section 360d of this title to be applicable to any aspect of such device,
<br>
<br>(vi) if appropriate, specimens of the labeling proposed to be used for such device,
<br>
<br>(vii) such other information relevant to the subject matter of the protocol as the Secretary, with the concurrence of the appropriate panel or panels under section 360c of this title, may require, and
<br>
<br>(viii) a requirement for submission of progress reports and, when completed, records of the trials conducted under the protocol which records are adequate to show compliance with the protocol.
<br>
<br>(4) The Secretary shall approve or disapprove a proposed product development protocol submitted under paragraph (2) within one hundred and twenty days of its receipt unless an additional period is agreed upon by the Secretary and the person who submitted the protocol. Approval of a protocol or denial of approval of a protocol is final agency action subject to judicial review under chapter 7 of title 5.
<br>
<br>(5) At any time after a product development protocol for a device has been approved pursuant to paragraph (4), the person for whom the protocol was approved may submit a notice of completion—
<br>
<br>(A) stating (i) his determination that the requirements of the protocol have been fulfilled and that, to the best of his knowledge, there is no reason bearing on safety or effectiveness why the notice of completion should not become effective, and (ii) the data and other information upon which such determination was made, and
<br>
<br>(B) setting forth the results of the trials required by the protocol and all the information required by subsection (c)(1).
<br>
<br>(6)(A) The Secretary may, after providing the person who has an approved protocol an opportunity for an informal hearing and at any time prior to receipt of notice of completion of such protocol, issue a final order to revoke such protocol if he finds that—
<br>
<br>(i) such person has failed substantially to comply with the requirements of the protocol,
<br>
<br>(ii) the results of the trials obtained under the protocol differ so substantially from the results required by the protocol that further trials cannot be justified, or
<br>
<br>(iii) the results of the trials conducted under the protocol or available new information do not demonstrate that the device tested under the protocol does not present an unreasonable risk to health and safety.
<br>
<br>(B) After the receipt of a notice of completion of an approved protocol the Secretary shall, within the ninety-day period beginning on the date such notice is received, by order either declare the protocol completed or declare it not completed. An order declaring a protocol not completed may take effect only after the Secretary has provided the person who has the protocol opportunity for an informal hearing on the order. Such an order may be issued only if the Secretary finds—
<br>
<br>(i) such person has failed substantially to comply with the requirements of the protocol,
<br>
<br>(ii) the results of the trials obtained under the protocol differ substantially from the results required by the protocol, or
<br>
<br>(iii) there is a lack of a showing of reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling thereof.
<br>
<br>(C) A final order issued under subparagraph (A) or (B) shall be in writing and shall contain the reasons to support the conclusions thereof.
<br>
<br>(7) At any time after a notice of completion has become effective, the Secretary may issue an order (after due notice and opportunity for an informal hearing to the person for whom the notice is effective) revoking the approval of a device provided by a notice of completion which has become effective as provided in subparagraph (B) if he finds that any of the grounds listed in subparagraphs (A) through (G) of subsection (e)(1) of this section apply. Each reference in such subparagraphs to an application shall be considered for purposes of this paragraph as a reference to a protocol and the notice of completion of such protocol, and each reference to the time when an application was approved shall be considered for purposes of this paragraph as a reference to the time when a notice of completion took effect.
<br>
<br>(8) A person who has an approved protocol subject to an order issued under paragraph (6)(A) revoking such protocol, a person who has an approved protocol with respect to which an order under paragraph (6)(B) was issued declaring that the protocol had not been completed, or a person subject to an order issued under paragraph (7) revoking the approval of a device may, by petition filed on or before the thirtieth day after the date upon which he receives notice of such order, obtain review thereof in accordance with either paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (g).
<br>(g) Review
<br>
<br>(1) Upon petition for review of—
<br>
<br>(A) an order under subsection (d) approving or denying approval of an application or an order under subsection (e) withdrawing approval of an application, or
<br>
<br>(B) an order under subsection (f)(6)(A) revoking an approved protocol, under subsection (f)(6)(B) declaring that an approved protocol has not been completed, or under subsection (f)(7) revoking the approval of a device,
<br>
<br>the Secretary shall, unless he finds the petition to be without good cause or unless a petition for review of such order has been submitted under paragraph (2), hold a hearing, in accordance with section 554 of title 5, on the order. The panel or panels which considered the application, protocol, or device subject to such order shall designate a member to appear and testify at any such hearing upon request of the Secretary, the petitioner, or the officer conducting the hearing, but this requirement does not preclude any other member of the panel or panels from appearing and testifying at any such hearing. Upon completion of such hearing and after considering the record established in such hearing, the Secretary shall issue an order either affirming the order subject to the hearing or reversing such order and, as appropriate, approving or denying approval of the application, reinstating the application's approval, approving the protocol, or placing in effect a notice of completion.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) Upon petition for review of—
<br>
<br>(i) an order under subsection (d) approving or denying approval of an application or an order under subsection (e) withdrawing approval of an application, or
<br>
<br>(ii) an order under subsection (f)(6)(A) revoking an approved protocol, under subsection (f)(6)(B) declaring that an approved protocol has not been completed, or under subsection (f)(7) revoking the approval of a device,
<br>
<br>the Secretary shall refer the application or protocol subject to the order and the basis for the order to an advisory committee of experts established pursuant to subparagraph (B) for a report and recommendation with respect to the order. The advisory committee shall, after independent study of the data and information furnished to it by the Secretary and other data and information before it, submit to the Secretary a report and recommendation, together with all underlying data and information and a statement of the reasons or basis for the recommendation. A copy of such report shall be promptly supplied by the Secretary to any person who petitioned for such referral to the advisory committee.
<br>
<br>(B) The Secretary shall establish advisory committees (which may not be panels under section 360c of this title) to receive referrals under subparagraph (A). The Secretary shall appoint as members of any such advisory committee persons qualified in the subject matter to be referred to the committee and of appropriately diversified professional backgrounds, except that the Secretary may not appoint to such a committee any individual who is in the regular full-time employ of the United States and engaged in the administration of this chapter. Members of an advisory committee (other than officers or employees of the United States), while attending conferences or meetings of their committee or otherwise serving at the request of the Secretary, shall be entitled to receive compensation at rates to be fixed by the Secretary, which rates may not exceed the daily equivalent for grade GS–18 of the General Schedule for each day (including traveltime) they are so engaged; and while so serving away from their homes or regular places of business each member may be allowed travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, as authorized by section 5703 of title 5 for persons in the Government service employed intermittently. The Secretary shall designate the chairman of an advisory committee from its members. The Secretary shall furnish each advisory committee with clerical and other assistance, and shall by regulation prescribe the procedures to be followed by each such committee in acting on referrals made under subparagraph (A).
<br>
<br>(C) The Secretary shall make public the report and recommendation made by an advisory committee with respect to an application and shall by order, stating the reasons therefor, either affirm the order referred to the advisory committee or reverse such order and, if appropriate, approve or deny approval of the application, reinstate the application's approval, approve the protocol, or place in effect a notice of completion.
<br>(h) Service of orders
<br>
<br>Orders of the Secretary under this section shall be served (1) in person by any officer or employee of the department designated by the Secretary, or (2) by mailing the order by registered mail or certified mail addressed to the applicant at his last known address in the records of the Secretary.
<br>(i) Revision
<br>
<br>(1) Before December 1, 1995, the Secretary shall by order require manufacturers of devices, which were introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce for commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, and which are subject to revision of classification under paragraph (2), to submit to the Secretary a summary of and citation to any information known or otherwise available to the manufacturer respecting such devices, including adverse safety or effectiveness information which has not been submitted under section 360i of this title. The Secretary may require the manufacturer to submit the adverse safety or effectiveness data for which a summary and citation were submitted, if such data are available to the manufacturer.
<br>
<br>(2) After the issuance of an order under paragraph (1) but before the date that is 2 years after July 9, 2012, the Secretary shall issue an administrative order following publication of a proposed order in the Federal Register, a meeting of a device classification panel described in section 360c(b) of this title, and consideration of comments from all affected stakeholders, including patients, payors, and providers, notwithstanding subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5, for each device—
<br>
<br>(A) which the Secretary has classified as a class III device, and
<br>
<br>(B) for which no administrative order has been issued under subsection (b) (or no regulation has been promulgated under such subsection prior to July 9, 2012),
<br>
<br>revising the classification of the device so that the device is classified into class I or class II, unless the administrative order issued under this paragraph requires the device to remain in class III. In determining whether to revise the classification of a device or to require a device to remain in class III, the Secretary shall apply the criteria set forth in section 360c(a) of this title.
<br>
<br>(3) The Secretary shall, as promptly as is reasonably achievable, but not later than 12 months after the effective date of the order requiring a device to remain in class III, establish a schedule for the issuance of an administrative order under subsection (b) for each device which is subject to the order requiring the device to remain in class III.
