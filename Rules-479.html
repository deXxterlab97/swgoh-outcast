<br>§5384. Orderly liquidation of covered financial companies
<br>(a) Purpose of orderly liquidation authority

<br>
<br>(2) management responsible for the condition of the financial company will not be retained; and
<br>
<br>(3) the Corporation and other appropriate agencies will take all steps necessary and appropriate to assure that all parties, including management, directors, and third parties, having responsibility for the condition of the financial company bear losses consistent with their responsibility, including actions for damages, restitution, and recoupment of compensation and other gains not compatible with such responsibility.
<br>(b) Corporation as receiver
<br>
<br>Upon the appointment of the Corporation under section 5382 of this title, the Corporation shall act as the receiver for the covered financial company, with all of the rights and obligations set forth in this subchapter.
<br>(c) Consultation
<br>
<br>The Corporation, as receiver—
<br>
<br>(1) shall consult with the primary financial regulatory agency or agencies of the covered financial company and its covered subsidiaries for purposes of ensuring an orderly liquidation of the covered financial company;
<br>
<br>(2) may consult with, or under subsection (a)(1)(B)(v) or (a)(1)(L) of section 5390 of this title, acquire the services of, any outside experts, as appropriate to inform and aid the Corporation in the orderly liquidation process;
<br>
<br>(3) shall consult with the primary financial regulatory agency or agencies of any subsidiaries of the covered financial company that are not covered subsidiaries, and coordinate with such regulators regarding the treatment of such solvent subsidiaries and the separate resolution of any such insolvent subsidiaries under other governmental authority, as appropriate; and
<br>
<br>(4) shall consult with the Commission and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation in the case of any covered financial company for which the Corporation has been appointed as receiver that is a broker or dealer registered with the Commission under section 78o(b) of title 15 and is a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, for the purpose of determining whether to transfer to a bridge financial company organized by the Corporation as receiver, without consent of any customer, customer accounts of the covered financial company.
<br>(d) Funding for orderly liquidation
<br>
<br>Upon its appointment as receiver for a covered financial company, and thereafter as the Corporation may, in its discretion, determine to be necessary or appropriate, the Corporation may make available to the receivership, subject to the conditions set forth in section 5386 of this title and subject to the plan described in section 5390(n)(9) of this title, funds for the orderly liquidation of the covered financial company. All funds provided by the Corporation under this subsection shall have a priority of claims under subparagraph (A) or (B) of section 5390(b)(1) of this title, as applicable, including funds used for—
<br>
<br>(1) making loans to, or purchasing any debt obligation of, the covered financial company or any covered subsidiary;
<br>
<br>(2) purchasing or guaranteeing against loss the assets of the covered financial company or any covered subsidiary, directly or through an entity established by the Corporation for such purpose;
<br>
<br>(3) assuming or guaranteeing the obligations of the covered financial company or any covered subsidiary to 1 or more third parties;
<br>
<br>(4) taking a lien on any or all assets of the covered financial company or any covered subsidiary, including a first priority lien on all unencumbered assets of the covered financial company or any covered subsidiary to secure repayment of any transactions conducted under this subsection, except that, if the covered financial company or covered subsidiary is an insurance company or a subsidiary of an insurance company, the Corporation—
<br>
<br>(A) shall promptly notify the State insurance authority for the insurance company of the intention to take such lien; and
<br>
<br>(B) may only take such lien—
<br>
<br>(i) to secure repayment of funds made available to such covered financial company or covered subsidiary; and
<br>
<br>(ii) if the Corporation determines, after consultation with the State insurance authority, that such lien will not unduly impede or delay the liquidation or rehabilitation of the insurance company, or the recovery by its policyholders;
<br>
<br>(5) selling or transferring all, or any part, of such acquired assets, liabilities, or obligations of the covered financial company or any covered subsidiary; and
<br>
<br>(6) making payments pursuant to subsections (b)(4), (d)(4), and (h)(5)(E) of section 5390 of this title.

<br>(h) Rulemaking
<br>

<br>(i) the claim of the creditor against the covered financial company is disallowed;

<br>
<br>(I) the date that is 90 days before the date on which the Corporation is appointed as receiver for the covered financial company; or
<br>
<br>(II) the first day on which there is an insufficiency during the 90-day period preceding the date on which the Corporation is appointed as receiver for the covered financial company.

<br>
<br>The term "insolvent" has the same meaning as in section 101(32) of the Bankruptcy Code.
<br>(D) Presumption of insolvency
<br>
<br>For purposes of this paragraph, the covered financial company is presumed to have been insolvent on and during the 90-day period preceding the date of appointment of the Corporation as receiver.

<br>(F) Priority claim
<br>
<br>Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, the Corporation as receiver for the covered financial company may sell or transfer any assets free and clear of the setoff rights of any party, except that such party shall be entitled to a claim, subordinate to the claims payable under subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), and (D) of subsection (b)(1), but senior to all other unsecured liabilities defined in subsection (b)(1)(E), in an amount equal to the value of such setoff rights.
<br>(13) Attachment of assets and other injunctive relief
<br>
<br>Subject to paragraph (14), any court of competent jurisdiction may, at the request of the Corporation as receiver for a covered financial company, issue an order in accordance with Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, including an order placing the assets of any person designated by the Corporation under the control of the court and appointing a trustee to hold such assets.
<br>(14) Standards
<br>(A) Showing
<br>
<br>Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure shall apply with respect to any proceeding under paragraph (13), without regard to the requirement that the applicant show that the injury, loss, or damage is irreparable and immediate.
<br>(B) State proceeding
