<br>Section 10606(b)(4) of title 42, referred to in subsec. (c)(3)(D), was in the original "section 1102(b)(4)", meaning section 1102(b)(4) of Pub. L. 101–647, which has been translated as reading section 502(b)(4) of Pub. L. 101–647 to reflect the probable intent of Congress because Pub. L. 101–647 does not contain a section 1102 and section 502(b)(4) relates to the right of crime victims to be present at public court proceedings. Section 10606 of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare, was repealed by Pub. L. 108–405, title I, §102(c), Oct. 30, 2004, 118 Stat. 2264.
