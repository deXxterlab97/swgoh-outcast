<br>
<br>(i) a money judgment rendered by a United States district court in favor of a victim of an offense for which such defendant has been convicted, or a legal representative of such victim; and
<br>
<br>(ii) a fine imposed by a court of the United States; and

<br>(2) The court shall direct the disposition of all such proceeds in the possession of the Attorney General at the end of such five years and may require that all or any part of such proceeds be released from escrow and paid into the Crime Victims Fund in the Treasury.
<br>
<br>(d) As used in this section, the term "interested party" includes the defendant and any transferee of proceeds due the defendant under the contract, the person with whom the defendant has contracted, and any person physically harmed as a result of the offense for which the defendant has been convicted.

<br>§3691. Jury trial of criminal contempts
<br>
<br>Whenever a contempt charged shall consist in willful disobedience of any lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command of any district court of the United States by doing or omitting any act or thing in violation thereof, and the act or thing done or omitted also constitutes a criminal offense under any Act of Congress, or under the laws of any state in which it was done or omitted, the accused, upon demand therefor, shall be entitled to trial by a jury, which shall conform as near as may be to the practice in other criminal cases.
<br>
<br>This section shall not apply to contempts committed in the presence of the court, or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice, nor to contempts committed in disobedience of any lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command entered in any suit or action brought or prosecuted in the name of, or on behalf of, the United States.

<br>
<br>This section shall not apply to contempts committed in the presence of the court or so near thereto as to interfere directly with the administration of justice nor to the misbehavior, misconduct, or disobedience of any officer of the court in respect to the writs, orders or process of the court.

<br>§3731. Appeal by United States
<br>
<br>In a criminal case an appeal by the United States shall lie to a court of appeals from a decision, judgment, or order of a district court dismissing an indictment or information or granting a new trial after verdict or judgment, as to any one or more counts, or any part thereof, except that no appeal shall lie where the double jeopardy clause of the United States Constitution prohibits further prosecution.
<br>
<br>An appeal by the United States shall lie to a court of appeals from a decision or order of a district court suppressing or excluding evidence or requiring the return of seized property in a criminal proceeding, not made after the defendant has been put in jeopardy and before the verdict or finding on an indictment or information, if the United States attorney certifies to the district court that the appeal is not taken for purpose of delay and that the evidence is a substantial proof of a fact material in the proceeding.
<br>
<br>An appeal by the United States shall lie to a court of appeals from a decision or order, entered by a district court of the United States, granting the release of a person charged with or convicted of an offense, or denying a motion for revocation of, or modification of the conditions of, a decision or order granting release.
<br>
<br>The appeal in all such cases shall be taken within thirty days after the decision, judgment or order has been rendered and shall be diligently prosecuted.
<br>
<br>The provisions of this section shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>1948 Act
<br>
<br>Based on title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §682 (Mar. 2, 1907, ch. 2564, 34 Stat. 1246; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §291, 36 Stat. 1167; Jan. 31, 1928, ch. 14, §1, 45 Stat. 54; May 9, 1942, ch. 295, §1, 56 Stat. 271).
<br>
<br>The word "dismissing" was substituted for "sustaining a motion to dismiss" in two places for conciseness and clarity, there being no difference in effect of a decision of dismissal whether made on motion or by the court sua sponte.
<br>
<br>Minor changes were made to conform to Rule 12 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The final sentence authorizing promulgation of rules is omitted as redundant.
<br>1949 Act
<br>
<br>This section [section 58] corrects a typographical error in the second paragraph of section 3731 of title 18, U.S.C., and conforms the language of the fifth, tenth, and eleventh paragraphs of such section 3731 with the changed nomenclature of title 28, U.S.C., Judiciary and Judicial Procedure. See sections 41, 43, and 451 of the latter title.
<br>

<br>
<br>1986—Fifth par. Pub. L. 99–646 struck out fifth par. which read as follows: "Pending the prosecution and determination of the appeal in the foregoing instances, the defendant shall be released in accordance with chapter 207 of this title."
<br>
<br>1984—First par. Pub. L. 98–473, §1206, inserted "or granting a new trial after verdict or judgment," after "indictment or information".
<br>
<br>Third par. Pub. L. 98–473, §205, inserted third par. relating to appeals from a decision or order, entered by a district court of the United States, granting the release of a person charged with or convicted of an offense, or denying a motion for revocation of, or modification of the conditions of, a decision or order granting release.
<br>
<br>1971—First par. Pub. L. 91–644, §14(a)(1), enacted provision for appeal to a court of appeals from decision, judgment, or order of district court dismissing an indictment or information as to any one or more counts, except that no appeal shall lie where double jeopardy prohibits further prosecution.
<br>
<br>Second par. Pub. L. 91–644, §14(a)(1), enacted provision for appeal to a court of appeals from decision or order of district court suppressing or excluding evidence or requiring the return of seized property in a criminal proceeding, not made after the defendant has been put in jeopardy and before the verdict or finding on an indictment or information, if the United States attorney certifies to the district court that the appeal is not taken for purpose of delay and that the evidence is a substantial proof of a fact material in the proceeding.
<br>
<br>Such first and second pars. superseded former first eight pars. Pars. one through four had provided for appeal from district courts to Supreme Court from decision or judgment setting aside, or dismissing any indictment or information, or any count thereof and from decision arresting judgment of conviction for insufficiency of indictment or information, where such decision or judgment was based upon invalidity or construction of the statute upon which the indictment or information was founded and for an appeal from decision or judgment sustaining a motion in bar, where defendant had not been put in jeopardy. Pars. five through eight provided for appeal from district courts to a court of appeals where there were no provisions for direct appeal to Supreme Court from decision or judgment setting aside, or dismissing any indictment or information, or any count thereof and from decision arresting a judgment of conviction, and from an order, granting a motion for return of seized property or a motion to suppress evidence, made before trial of a person charged with violation of a Federal law, if the United States attorney certified to the judge who granted the motion that the appeal was not taken for purpose of delay and that the evidence was a substantial proof of the charge pending against the defendant.
<br>
<br>Third par. Pub. L. 91–644, §14(a)(2), authorized within third par., formerly ninth, an appeal within thirty days after order has been rendered.
<br>
<br>Fourth par. Pub. L. 91–644, §14(a), in revising the provisions, had the effect of designating former tenth par. as fourth par.
<br>
<br>Fifth par. Pub. L. 91–644, §14(a)(3), substituted as a fifth par. provision for liberal construction of this section for prior eleventh par. provision respecting remand of case by Supreme Court to court of appeals that should have been taken to such court and treatment of the court's jurisdiction to hear and determine the case as if the appeal were so taken in the first instance and for prior twelfth par. provision respecting certification of case to Supreme Court that should have been taken directly to such Court and treatment of the Court's jurisdiction to hear and determine the case as if the appeal were taken directly to such Court.
<br>
<br>1968—Pub. L. 90–351 inserted eighth par. providing for an appeal by the United States from decisions sustaining motions to suppress evidence and substituted in tenth par. "defendant shall be released in accordance with chapter 207 of this title" for "defendant shall be admitted to bail on his own recognizance", respectively.
<br>
<br>1949—Act May 24, 1949, substituted "invalidity" for "validity" after "upon the" in second par., and conformed language of fifth, tenth, and eleventh pars. to the changed nomenclature of the courts.

<br>(1) a defendant may not file a notice of appeal under paragraph (3) or (4) of subsection (a) unless the sentence imposed is greater than the sentence set forth in such agreement; and
<br>
<br>(2) the Government may not file a notice of appeal under paragraph (3) or (4) of subsection (b) unless the sentence imposed is less than the sentence set forth in such agreement.
<br>
<br>(d) Record on Review.—If a notice of appeal is filed in the district court pursuant to subsection (a) or (b), the clerk shall certify to the court of appeals—
<br>
<br>(1) that portion of the record in the case that is designated as pertinent by either of the parties;
<br>
<br>(2) the presentence report; and
<br>
<br>(3) the information submitted during the sentencing proceeding.
<br>
<br>(e) Consideration.—Upon review of the record, the court of appeals shall determine whether the sentence—
<br>
<br>(1) was imposed in violation of law;
<br>
<br>(2) was imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines;
<br>
<br>(3) is outside the applicable guideline range, and
<br>
<br>(A) the district court failed to provide the written statement of reasons required by section 3553(c);
<br>
<br>(B) the sentence departs from the applicable guideline range based on a factor that—
<br>
<br>(i) does not advance the objectives set forth in section 3553(a)(2); or
<br>
<br>(ii) is not authorized under section 3553(b); or
<br>
<br>(iii) is not justified by the facts of the case; or
<br>
<br>(C) the sentence departs to an unreasonable degree from the applicable guidelines range, having regard for the factors to be considered in imposing a sentence, as set forth in section 3553(a) of this title and the reasons for the imposition of the particular sentence, as stated by the district court pursuant to the provisions of section 3553(c); or
<br>
<br>(4) was imposed for an offense for which there is no applicable sentencing guideline and is plainly unreasonable.
<br>
<br>The court of appeals shall give due regard to the opportunity of the district court to judge the credibility of the witnesses, and shall accept the findings of fact of the district court unless they are clearly erroneous and, except with respect to determinations under subsection (3)(A) or (3)(B), shall give due deference to the district court's application of the guidelines to the facts. With respect to determinations under subsection (3)(A) or (3)(B), the court of appeals shall review de novo the district court's application of the guidelines to the facts.
<br>
<br>(f) Decision and Disposition.—If the court of appeals determines that—
<br>
<br>(1) the sentence was imposed in violation of law or imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines, the court shall remand the case for further sentencing proceedings with such instructions as the court considers appropriate;
<br>
<br>(2) the sentence is outside the applicable guideline range and the district court failed to provide the required statement of reasons in the order of judgment and commitment, or the departure is based on an impermissible factor, or is to an unreasonable degree, or the sentence was imposed for an offense for which there is no applicable sentencing guideline and is plainly unreasonable, it shall state specific reasons for its conclusions and—
<br>
<br>(A) if it determines that the sentence is too high and the appeal has been filed under subsection (a), it shall set aside the sentence and remand the case for further sentencing proceedings with such instructions as the court considers appropriate, subject to subsection (g);
<br>
<br>(B) if it determines that the sentence is too low and the appeal has been filed under subsection (b), it shall set aside the sentence and remand the case for further sentencing proceedings with such instructions as the court considers appropriate, subject to subsection (g);
<br>
<br>(3) the sentence is not described in paragraph (1) or (2), it shall affirm the sentence.
<br>
<br>(g) Sentencing Upon Remand.—A district court to which a case is remanded pursuant to subsection (f)(1) or (f)(2) shall resentence a defendant in accordance with section 3553 and with such instructions as may have been given by the court of appeals, except that—
<br>
<br>(1) In determining the range referred to in subsection 3553(a)(4), the court shall apply the guidelines issued by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to section 994(a)(1) of title 28, United States Code, and that were in effect on the date of the previous sentencing of the defendant prior to the appeal, together with any amendments thereto by any act of Congress that was in effect on such date; and
<br>
<br>(2) The court shall not impose a sentence outside the applicable guidelines range except upon a ground that—
<br>
<br>(A) was specifically and affirmatively included in the written statement of reasons required by section 3553(c) in connection with the previous sentencing of the defendant prior to the appeal; and
<br>
<br>(B) was held by the court of appeals, in remanding the case, to be a permissible ground of departure.
<br>
<br>(h) Application to a Sentence by a Magistrate Judge.—An appeal of an otherwise final sentence imposed by a United States magistrate judge may be taken to a judge of the district court, and this section shall apply (except for the requirement of approval by the Attorney General or the Solicitor General in the case of a Government appeal) as though the appeal were to a court of appeals from a sentence imposed by a district court.
<br>
<br>(i) Guideline Not Expressed as a Range.—For the purpose of this section, the term "guideline range" includes a guideline range having the same upper and lower limits.
<br>
<br>(j) Definitions.—For purposes of this section—
<br>
<br>(1) a factor is a "permissible" ground of departure if it—
<br>
<br>(A) advances the objectives set forth in section 3553(a)(2); and
<br>
<br>(B) is authorized under section 3553(b); and
<br>
<br>(C) is justified by the facts of the case; and
<br>
<br>(2) a factor is an "impermissible" ground of departure if it is not a permissible factor within the meaning of subsection (j)(1).

<br>Editorial Notes
<br>Prior Provisions
<br>

<br>§3771. Crime victims' rights
<br>
<br>(a) Rights of Crime Victims.—A crime victim has the following rights:
<br>
<br>(1) The right to be reasonably protected from the accused.
<br>
<br>(2) The right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding, or any parole proceeding, involving the crime or of any release or escape of the accused.
<br>
<br>(3) The right not to be excluded from any such public court proceeding, unless the court, after receiving clear and convincing evidence, determines that testimony by the victim would be materially altered if the victim heard other testimony at that proceeding.
<br>
<br>(4) The right to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court involving release, plea, sentencing, or any parole proceeding.
<br>
<br>(5) The reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the Government in the case.
<br>
<br>(6) The right to full and timely restitution as provided in law.
<br>
<br>(7) The right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay.
<br>
<br>(8) The right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim's dignity and privacy.
<br>
<br>(9) The right to be informed in a timely manner of any plea bargain or deferred prosecution agreement.
<br>
<br>(10) The right to be informed of the rights under this section and the services described in section 503(c) of the Victims' Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 10607(c)) 1 and provided contact information for the Office of the Victims' Rights Ombudsman of the Department of Justice.
<br>
<br>(b) Rights Afforded.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—In any court proceeding involving an offense against a crime victim, the court shall ensure that the crime victim is afforded the rights described in subsection (a). Before making a determination described in subsection (a)(3), the court shall make every effort to permit the fullest attendance possible by the victim and shall consider reasonable alternatives to the exclusion of the victim from the criminal proceeding. The reasons for any decision denying relief under this chapter shall be clearly stated on the record.
<br>
<br>(2) Habeas corpus proceedings.—
<br>
<br>(A) In general.—In a Federal habeas corpus proceeding arising out of a State conviction, the court shall ensure that a crime victim is afforded the rights described in paragraphs (3), (4), (7), and (8) of subsection (a).
<br>
<br>(B) Enforcement.—
<br>
<br>(i) In general.—These rights may be enforced by the crime victim or the crime victim's lawful representative in the manner described in paragraphs (1) and (3) of subsection (d).
<br>
<br>(ii) Multiple victims.—In a case involving multiple victims, subsection (d)(2) shall also apply.
<br>
<br>(C) Limitation.—This paragraph relates to the duties of a court in relation to the rights of a crime victim in Federal habeas corpus proceedings arising out of a State conviction, and does not give rise to any obligation or requirement applicable to personnel of any agency of the Executive Branch of the Federal Government.
<br>
<br>(D) Definition.—For purposes of this paragraph, the term "crime victim" means the person against whom the State offense is committed or, if that person is killed or incapacitated, that person's family member or other lawful representative.
<br>
<br>(c) Best Efforts To Accord Rights.—
<br>
<br>(1) Government.—Officers and employees of the Department of Justice and other departments and agencies of the United States engaged in the detection, investigation, or prosecution of crime shall make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded, the rights described in subsection (a).
<br>
<br>(2) Advice of attorney.—The prosecutor shall advise the crime victim that the crime victim can seek the advice of an attorney with respect to the rights described in subsection (a).
<br>
<br>(3) Notice.—Notice of release otherwise required pursuant to this chapter shall not be given if such notice may endanger the safety of any person.
<br>
<br>(d) Enforcement and Limitations.—
<br>
<br>(1) Rights.—The crime victim or the crime victim's lawful representative, and the attorney for the Government may assert the rights described in subsection (a). A person accused of the crime may not obtain any form of relief under this chapter.
<br>
<br>(2) Multiple crime victims.—In a case where the court finds that the number of crime victims makes it impracticable to accord all of the crime victims the rights described in subsection (a), the court shall fashion a reasonable procedure to give effect to this chapter that does not unduly complicate or prolong the proceedings.
<br>
<br>(3) Motion for relief and writ of mandamus.—The rights described in subsection (a) shall be asserted in the district court in which a defendant is being prosecuted for the crime or, if no prosecution is underway, in the district court in the district in which the crime occurred. The district court shall take up and decide any motion asserting a victim's right forthwith. If the district court denies the relief sought, the movant may petition the court of appeals for a writ of mandamus. The court of appeals may issue the writ on the order of a single judge pursuant to circuit rule or the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. The court of appeals shall take up and decide such application forthwith within 72 hours after the petition has been filed, unless the litigants, with the approval of the court, have stipulated to a different time period for consideration. In deciding such application, the court of appeals shall apply ordinary standards of appellate review. In no event shall proceedings be stayed or subject to a continuance of more than five days for purposes of enforcing this chapter. If the court of appeals denies the relief sought, the reasons for the denial shall be clearly stated on the record in a written opinion.
<br>
<br>(4) Error.—In any appeal in a criminal case, the Government may assert as error the district court's denial of any crime victim's right in the proceeding to which the appeal relates.
<br>
<br>(5) Limitation on relief.—In no case shall a failure to afford a right under this chapter provide grounds for a new trial. A victim may make a motion to re-open a plea or sentence only if—
<br>
<br>(A) the victim has asserted the right to be heard before or during the proceeding at issue and such right was denied;
<br>
<br>(B) the victim petitions the court of appeals for a writ of mandamus within 14 days; and
<br>
<br>(C) in the case of a plea, the accused has not pled to the highest offense charged.
<br>
<br>This paragraph does not affect the victim's right to restitution as provided in title 18, United States Code.
<br>
<br>(6) No cause of action.—Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to authorize a cause of action for damages or to create, to enlarge, or to imply any duty or obligation to any victim or other person for the breach of which the United States or any of its officers or employees could be held liable in damages. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to impair the prosecutorial discretion of the Attorney General or any officer under his direction.
<br>
<br>(e) Definitions.—For the purposes of this chapter:
<br>
<br>(1) Court of appeals.—The term "court of appeals" means—
<br>
<br>(A) the United States court of appeals for the judicial district in which a defendant is being prosecuted; or
<br>
<br>(B) for a prosecution in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.
<br>
<br>(2) Crime victim.—
<br>
<br>(A) In general.—The term "crime victim" means a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.
<br>
<br>(B) Minors and certain other victims.—In the case of a crime victim who is under 18 years of age, incompetent, incapacitated, or deceased, the legal guardians of the crime victim or the representatives of the crime victim's estate, family members, or any other persons appointed as suitable by the court, may assume the crime victim's rights under this chapter, but in no event shall the defendant be named as such guardian or representative.
<br>
<br>(3) District court; court.—The terms "district court" and "court" include the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.
<br>
