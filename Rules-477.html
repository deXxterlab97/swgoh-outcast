<br>(1) Notice and opportunity for comment

<br>
<br>(A) shall take costs to long-term economic growth into account; and

<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Each primary financial regulatory agency may impose, require reports regarding, examine for compliance with, and enforce standards in accordance with this section with respect to those entities for which it is the primary financial regulatory agency.
<br>(B) Rule of construction
<br>
<br>The authority under this paragraph is in addition to, and does not limit, any other authority of a primary financial regulatory agency. Compliance by an entity with actions taken by a primary financial regulatory agency under this section shall be enforceable in accordance with the statutes governing the respective jurisdiction of the primary financial regulatory agency over the entity, as if the agency action were taken under those statutes.
<br>(2) Imposition of standards
<br>
<br>The primary financial regulatory agency shall impose the standards recommended by the Council in accordance with subsection (a), or similar standards that the Council deems acceptable, or shall explain in writing to the Council, not later than 90 days after the date on which the Council issues the recommendation, why the agency has determined not to follow the recommendation of the Council.
<br>(d) Report to Congress
<br>
<br>The Council shall report to Congress on—
<br>
<br>(1) any recommendations issued by the Council under this section;

<br>(e) Effect of rescission of identification
<br>(1) Notice
<br>
<br>The Council may recommend to the relevant primary financial regulatory agency that a financial activity or practice no longer requires any standards or safeguards implemented under this section.
<br>(2) Determination of primary financial regulatory agency to continue
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Upon receipt of a recommendation under paragraph (1), a primary financial regulatory agency that has imposed standards under this section shall determine whether such standards should remain in effect.
<br>(B) Appeal process
<br>
<br>Each primary financial regulatory agency that has imposed standards under this section shall promulgate regulations to establish a procedure under which entities under its jurisdiction may appeal a determination by such agency under this paragraph that standards imposed under this section should remain in effect.

<br>
<br>(3) require the company to terminate one or more activities;
<br>
<br>(4) impose conditions on the manner in which the company conducts 1 or more activities; or

<br>(b) Notice and hearing
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Board of Governors, in consultation with the Council, shall provide to a company described in subsection (a) written notice that such company is being considered for mitigatory action pursuant to this section, including an explanation of the basis for, and description of, the proposed mitigatory action.
<br>(2) Hearing
<br>
<br>Not later than 30 days after the date of receipt of notice under paragraph (1), the company may request, in writing, an opportunity for a written or oral hearing before the Board of Governors to contest the proposed mitigatory action. Upon receipt of a timely request, the Board of Governors shall fix a time (not later than 30 days after the date of receipt of the request) and place at which such company may appear, personally or through counsel, to submit written materials (or, at the discretion of the Board of Governors, in consultation with the Council, oral testimony and oral argument).
<br>(3) Decision
<br>
<br>Not later than 60 days after the date of a hearing under paragraph (2), or not later than 60 days after the provision of a notice under paragraph (1) if no hearing was held, the Board of Governors shall notify the company of the final decision of the Board of Governors, including the results of the vote of the Council, as described in subsection (a).

<br>In order to prevent or mitigate risks to the financial stability of the United States that could arise from the material financial distress or failure, or ongoing activities, of large, interconnected financial institutions, the Board of Governors shall, on its own or pursuant to recommendations by the Council under section 5325 of this title, establish prudential standards for nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors and bank holding companies with total consolidated assets equal to or greater than $250,000,000,000 that—
<br>
<br>(A) are more stringent than the standards and requirements applicable to nonbank financial companies and bank holding companies that do not present similar risks to the financial stability of the United States; and
<br>
<br>(B) increase in stringency, based on the considerations identified in subsection (b)(3).
<br>(2) Tailored application
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>In prescribing more stringent prudential standards under this section, the Board of Governors shall, on its own or pursuant to a recommendation by the Council in accordance with section 5325 of this title, differentiate among companies on an individual basis or by category, taking into consideration their capital structure, riskiness, complexity, financial activities (including the financial activities of their subsidiaries), size, and any other risk-related factors that the Board of Governors deems appropriate.
<br>(B) Adjustment of threshold for application of certain standards
<br>
<br>The Board of Governors may, pursuant to a recommendation by the Council in accordance with section 5325 of this title, establish an asset threshold above the applicable threshold for the application of any standard established under subsections (c) through (g).
<br>(C) Risks to financial stability and safety and soundness
<br>
<br>The Board of Governors may by order or rule promulgated pursuant to section 553 of title 5 apply any prudential standard established under this section to any bank holding company or bank holding companies with total consolidated assets equal to or greater than $100,000,000,000 to which the prudential standard does not otherwise apply provided that the Board of Governors—
<br>
<br>(i) determines that application of the prudential standard is appropriate—
<br>
<br>(I) to prevent or mitigate risks to the financial stability of the United States, as described in paragraph (1); or
<br>
<br>(II) to promote the safety and soundness of the bank holding company or bank holding companies; and
<br>
<br>(ii) takes into consideration the bank holding company's or bank holding companies' capital structure, riskiness, complexity, financial activities (including financial activities of subsidiaries), size, and any other risk-related factors that the Board of Governors deems appropriate.
<br>(b) Development of prudential standards
<br>(1) In general
<br>(A) Required standards
<br>
<br>The Board of Governors shall establish prudential standards for nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors and bank holding companies described in subsection (a), that shall include—
<br>
<br>(i) risk-based capital requirements and leverage limits, unless the Board of Governors, in consultation with the Council, determines that such requirements are not appropriate for a company subject to more stringent prudential standards because of the activities of such company (such as investment company activities or assets under management) or structure, in which case, the Board of Governors shall apply other standards that result in similarly stringent risk controls;
<br>
<br>(ii) liquidity requirements;
<br>
<br>(iii) overall risk management requirements;
<br>
<br>(iv) resolution plan requirements; and
<br>
<br>(v) concentration limits.
<br>(B) Additional standards authorized
<br>
<br>The Board of Governors may establish additional prudential standards for nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors and bank holding companies described in subsection (a), that include—
<br>
<br>(i) a contingent capital requirement;
<br>
<br>(ii) enhanced public disclosures, including credit exposure reports;
<br>
<br>(iii) short-term debt limits; and
<br>
<br>(iv) such other prudential standards as the Board or Governors, on its own or pursuant to a recommendation made by the Council in accordance with section 5325 of this title, determines are appropriate.
<br>(2) Standards for foreign financial companies
<br>
<br>In applying the standards set forth in paragraph (1) to any foreign nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors or foreign-based bank holding company, the Board of Governors shall—
<br>
<br>(A) give due regard to the principle of national treatment and equality of competitive opportunity; and
<br>
<br>(B) take into account the extent to which the foreign financial company is subject on a consolidated basis to home country standards that are comparable to those applied to financial companies in the United States.
<br>(3) Considerations
<br>
<br>In prescribing prudential standards under paragraph (1), the Board of Governors shall—
<br>
<br>(A) take into account differences among nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors and bank holding companies described in subsection (a), based on—
<br>
<br>(i) the factors described in subsections (a) and (b) of section 5323 of this title;
<br>
<br>(ii) whether the company owns an insured depository institution;
<br>
<br>(iii) nonfinancial activities and affiliations of the company; and
<br>
<br>(iv) any other risk-related factors that the Board of Governors determines appropriate;
<br>
<br>(B) to the extent possible, ensure that small changes in the factors listed in subsections (a) and (b) of section 5323 of this title would not result in sharp, discontinuous changes in the prudential standards established under paragraph (1) of this subsection;
<br>
<br>(C) take into account any recommendations of the Council under section 5325 of this title; and
<br>
<br>(D) adapt the required standards as appropriate in light of any predominant line of business of such company, including assets under management or other activities for which particular standards may not be appropriate.
<br>(4) Consultation
<br>
<br>Before imposing prudential standards or any other requirements pursuant to this section, including notices of deficiencies in resolution plans and more stringent requirements or divestiture orders resulting from such notices, that are likely to have a significant impact on a functionally regulated subsidiary or depository institution subsidiary of a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors or a bank holding company described in subsection (a), the Board of Governors shall consult with each Council member that primarily supervises any such subsidiary with respect to any such standard or requirement.
<br>(5) Report
<br>
<br>The Board of Governors shall submit an annual report to Congress regarding the implementation of the prudential standards required pursuant to paragraph (1), including the use of such standards to mitigate risks to the financial stability of the United States.
<br>(c) Contingent capital
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Subsequent to submission by the Council of a report to Congress under section 5325(c) of this title, the Board of Governors may issue regulations that require each nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors and bank holding companies described in subsection (a) to maintain a minimum amount of contingent capital that is convertible to equity in times of financial stress.
<br>(2) Factors to consider
<br>
<br>In issuing regulations under this subsection, the Board of Governors shall consider—
<br>
<br>(A) the results of the study undertaken by the Council, and any recommendations of the Council, under section 5325(c) of this title;
<br>
<br>(B) an appropriate transition period for implementation of contingent capital under this subsection;
<br>
<br>(C) the factors described in subsection (b)(3)(A);
<br>
<br>(D) capital requirements applicable to the nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors or a bank holding company described in subsection (a), and subsidiaries thereof; and
<br>
<br>(E) any other factor that the Board of Governors deems appropriate.
<br>(d) Resolution plan and credit exposure reports

<br>

<br>
<br>(A) information regarding the manner and extent to which any insured depository institution affiliated with the company is adequately protected from risks arising from the activities of any nonbank subsidiaries of the company;
<br>
<br>(B) full descriptions of the ownership structure, assets, liabilities, and contractual obligations of the company;
<br>
<br>(C) identification of the cross-guarantees tied to different securities, identification of major counterparties, and a process for determining to whom the collateral of the company is pledged; and
<br>
<br>(D) any other information that the Board of Governors and the Corporation jointly require by rule or order.
<br>(2) Credit exposure report
<br>
<br>The Board of Governors may require each nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors and bank holding companies described in subsection (a) to report periodically to the Board of Governors, the Council, and the Corporation on—
<br>
<br>(A) the nature and extent to which the company has credit exposure to other significant nonbank financial companies and significant bank holding companies; and
<br>
<br>(B) the nature and extent to which other significant nonbank financial companies and significant bank holding companies have credit exposure to that company.
<br>(3) Review
<br>
<br>The Board of Governors and the Corporation shall review the information provided in accordance with this subsection by each nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors and bank holding company described in subsection (a).
<br>(4) Notice of deficiencies
<br>
<br>If the Board of Governors and the Corporation jointly determine, based on their review under paragraph (3), that the resolution plan of a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors or a bank holding company described in subsection (a) is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution of the company under title 11—
<br>
<br>(A) the Board of Governors and the Corporation shall notify the company of the deficiencies in the resolution plan; and
<br>
<br>(B) the company shall resubmit the resolution plan within a timeframe determined by the Board of Governors and the Corporation, with revisions demonstrating that the plan is credible and would result in an orderly resolution under title 11, including any proposed changes in business operations and corporate structure to facilitate implementation of the plan.
<br>(5) Failure to resubmit credible plan
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>If a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors or a bank holding company described in subsection (a) fails to timely resubmit the resolution plan as required under paragraph (4), with such revisions as are required under subparagraph (B), the Board of Governors and the Corporation may jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage, or liquidity requirements, or restrictions on the growth, activities, or operations of the company, or any subsidiary thereof, until such time as the company resubmits a plan that remedies the deficiencies.
<br>(B) Divestiture
<br>
<br>The Board of Governors and the Corporation, in consultation with the Council, may jointly direct a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors or a bank holding company described in subsection (a), by order, to divest certain assets or operations identified by the Board of Governors and the Corporation, to facilitate an orderly resolution of such company under title 11, in the event of the failure of such company, in any case in which—
<br>
<br>(i) the Board of Governors and the Corporation have jointly imposed more stringent requirements on the company pursuant to subparagraph (A); and
<br>
<br>(ii) the company has failed, within the 2-year period beginning on the date of the imposition of such requirements under subparagraph (A), to resubmit the resolution plan with such revisions as were required under paragraph (4)(B).
<br>(6) No limiting effect
<br>
<br>A resolution plan submitted in accordance with this subsection shall not be binding on a bankruptcy court, a receiver appointed under subchapter II, or any other authority that is authorized or required to resolve the nonbank financial company supervised by the Board, any bank holding company, or any subsidiary or affiliate of the foregoing.
<br>(7) No private right of action
<br>
<br>No private right of action may be based on any resolution plan submitted in accordance with this subsection.

<br>(2) Limitation on credit exposure
<br>
<br>The regulations prescribed by the Board of Governors under paragraph (1) shall prohibit each nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors and bank holding company described in subsection (a) from having credit exposure to any unaffiliated company that exceeds 25 percent of the capital stock and surplus (or such lower amount as the Board of Governors may determine by regulation to be necessary to mitigate risks to the financial stability of the United States) of the company.
<br>(3) Credit exposure
<br>
<br>For purposes of paragraph (2), "credit exposure" to a company means—
<br>
<br>(A) all extensions of credit to the company, including loans, deposits, and lines of credit;
<br>

<br>(4) Attribution rule
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subsection, any transaction by a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors or a bank holding company described in subsection (a) with any person is a transaction with a company, to the extent that the proceeds of the transaction are used for the benefit of, or transferred to, that company.

<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>In order to mitigate the risks that an over-accumulation of short-term debt could pose to financial companies and to the stability of the United States financial system, the Board of Governors may, by regulation, prescribe a limit on the amount of short-term debt, including off-balance sheet exposures, that may be accumulated by any bank holding company described in subsection (a) and any nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors.
<br>(2) Basis of limit

<br>Any limit prescribed under paragraph (1) shall be based on the short-term debt of the company described in paragraph (1) as a percentage of capital stock and surplus of the company or on such other measure as the Board of Governors considers appropriate.
<br>(3) Short-term debt defined
<br>
<br>For purposes of this subsection, the term "short-term debt" means such liabilities with short-dated maturity that the Board of Governors identifies, by regulation, except that such term does not include insured deposits.
