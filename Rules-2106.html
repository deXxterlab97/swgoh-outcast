This section may be used to guarantee obligations for a total of not more than 5 separate facilities and plantships or a demonstrated 400 megawatt capacity, whichever comes first.
<br>

<br>
<br>(d) Reasonableness of Risk.—A guarantee or commitment to guarantee may not be made under this section unless the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the Administrator, certifies to the Administrator that, for the facility or plantship for which the guarantee or commitment to guarantee is sought, there is sufficient guarantee of performance and payment to lower the risk to the United States Government to a reasonable level. In deciding whether to issue such a certification, the Secretary of Energy shall consider—
<br>
<br>(1) the successful demonstration of the technology to be used in the facility at a scale sufficient to establish the likelihood of technical and economic viability in the proposed market; and
<br>
<br>(2) the need of the United States to develop new and renewable sources of energy and the benefits to be realized from the construction and successful operation of the facility or plantship.
<br>
<br>(e) Amount of Obligation.—The total principal amount of an obligation guaranteed under this section may not exceed 87.5 percent of—
<br>
<br>(1) the actual cost or depreciated actual cost of the facility or plantship; or
<br>
<br>(2) if the facility or plantship is supported with appropriated Federal funds, the total principal amount of that portion of the actual cost or depreciated actual cost for which the obligor is obligated to secure financing under the agreement between the obligor and the Department of Energy or other Federal agency.
<br>
<br>(f) OTEC Demonstration Fund.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—There is a special subaccount, known as the OTEC Demonstration Fund, in the account established under section 53717(b)(1) of this title.
<br>
<br>(2) Use and operation.—The OTEC Demonstration Fund shall be used for obligation guarantees authorized under this section that do not qualify under subchapter I of this chapter. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the OTEC Demonstration Fund shall be operated in the same manner as the parent account. However—
<br>
<br>(A) amounts received by the Administrator under subchapter I of this chapter related to guarantees or commitments to guarantee made under this section shall be deposited only in the OTEC Demonstration Fund; and
<br>
<br>(B) when obligations issued by the Administrator under section 53723 of this title related to the OTEC Demonstration Fund are outstanding, any amount received by the Administrator under subchapter I of this chapter related to ocean thermal energy conversion facilities or plantships shall be deposited in the OTEC Demonstration Fund.
<br>
<br>(3) Transfers.—Assets in the OTEC Demonstration Fund may be transferred to the parent account when and to the extent the balance in the OTEC Demonstration Fund exceeds the total guarantees or commitments to guarantee made under this section then outstanding, plus obligations issued by the Administrator under section 53723 of this title related to the OTEC Demonstration Fund.
<br>
<br>(4) Liability.—The parent account is not liable for a guarantee or commitment to guarantee made under this section.
<br>

<br>(a) General Authority.—Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the Secretary or Administrator, on terms the Secretary or Administrator may prescribe, may guarantee or make a commitment to guarantee the payment of the principal of and interest on an obligation that aids in financing or refinancing (including reimbursement of an obligor for expenditures previously made for) a contract for the construction or reconstruction of a vessel if—
<br>
<br>(1) the vessel is designed and to be used for commercial use in coastwise, intercoastal, or foreign trade;
<br>
<br>(2) the construction or reconstruction is necessary to replace a vessel that cannot continue to be operated because of a change required by law in the standards for the operation of vessels, and the applicant for the guarantee or commitment would not otherwise legally be able to continue operating vessels in the trades in which the applicant operated vessels before the change;
<br>
<br>(3) the applicant is presently engaged in transporting cargoes in vessels of the type and class that will be constructed or reconstructed under this section and agrees to employ vessels constructed or reconstructed under this section as replacements only for vessels made obsolete by the change in operating standards;
<br>
<br>(4) the capacity of the vessels to be constructed or reconstructed under this section will not increase the cargo carrying capacity of the vessels being replaced;
<br>
<br>(5) the Secretary or Administrator has not determined that the market demand for the vessel over its useful life will diminish so as to make granting the guarantee fiduciarily imprudent;
<br>
<br>(6) the vessel, if to be reconstructed, will have a useful life of at least 15 years after the reconstruction; and
<br>
<br>(7) the Secretary or Administrator has considered the criteria specified in section 53708(a)(3)–(5) of this title.

<br>(b) Term and Amount of Obligation.—
<br>
<br>(1) Term.—The term of an obligation guaranteed under this section may not exceed 25 years.
<br>
<br>(2) Amount.—The amount of an obligation guaranteed under this section may not exceed 87.5 percent of the actual cost or depreciated actual cost to the applicant for the construction or reconstruction of the vessel. The Secretary or Administrator may not establish a percentage under this paragraph that is to be applied uniformly to all guarantees or commitments to guarantee made under this section.
<br>
<br>(c) Applicability of Other Provisions.—A guarantee or commitment to guarantee under this section is also subject to sections 53701, 53702(a), 53704, 53705, 53707(a), 53708(d) and (e), 53709(a), 53710(a)(1), (2), and (4) and (c), 53711(a), 53713, 53714, 53717, and 53721–53725 of this title.
<br>
<br>(d) Security Against Default.—The Secretary or Administrator shall require by regulation that an applicant under this section provide adequate security against default.
<br>
<br>(e) Guarantee Fees.—The Secretary or Administrator may establish a fee for the guarantee of an obligation under this section that is in addition to the fee established under section 53714 of this title. The fee may be—
<br>
<br>(1) an annual fee of not more than an additional 1 percent added to the fee established under section 53714 of this title; or
<br>
<br>(2) a fee based on the amount of the obligation versus the percentage of the obligor's fleet being replaced by vessels constructed or reconstructed under this section.

<br>§53906. Hull insurance valuation
<br>
<br>(a) Stated Valuation.—The valuation in a hull insurance policy for actual or constructive total loss of the insured vessel shall be a stated valuation determined by the Secretary of Transportation. The stated valuation—

<br>
<br>(b) Rejecting Stated Valuation.—Within 60 days after the insurance attaches under a policy referred to in subsection (a) or within 60 days after the Secretary determines the valuation, whichever is later, the insured may reject the valuation and pay, at the rate provided in the policy, premiums based on the asserted valuation the insured specifies at the time of rejection. However, the asserted valuation is not binding on the Government in any subsequent action on the policy.
<br>
<br>(c) Amount of Claim.—If a vessel is actually or constructively totally lost and the insured under a policy referred to in subsection (a) has not rejected the stated valuation determined by the Secretary, the amount of a claim adjusted, compromised, settled, adjudged, or paid may not exceed the stated valuation. However, if the insured has rejected the valuation, the insured—
<br>
<br>(1) shall be paid, as a tentative advance only, 75 percent of the stated valuation; and
<br>
<br>(2) may bring a civil action against the United States in a court having jurisdiction of the claim to recover a valuation equal to the just compensation the court determines would have been payable if the ownership of the vessel had been requisitioned under chapter 563 of this title at the time the insurance attached under the policy.
<br>
<br>(d) Adjusting Premiums.—If a court makes a determination as provided under subsection (c)(2), premiums paid under the policy shall be adjusted based on the court's determination and the rates provided for in the policy.

The Secretary may obtain reinsurance from such a company for any insurance provided by the Secretary under this chapter.
<br>
<br>(b) Rates.—The Secretary may not provide reinsurance at rates less than, nor obtain reinsurance at rates more than, the rates established by the Secretary on the same or similar risks or the rates charged by the insurance company for the insurance reinsured, whichever is more advantageous to the Secretary. However, the Secretary may provide an allowance to the insurance company for the costs of services and facilities the company provides, in an amount the Secretary considers reasonable according to good business practice. The allowance to the company may not include any amount for soliciting or stimulating insurance business.

<br>§53911. Civil actions for losses
<br>
<br>(a) In General.—If there is a disagreement about a loss insured under this chapter, a civil action in admiralty may be brought against the United States in the district court of the United States for the district in which the plaintiff or the plaintiff's agent resides. If the plaintiff has no residence in the United States, the action may be brought in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or in the district court for any district in which the Attorney General agrees to accept service. Any person who may have an interest in the insurance may be made a party, either initially or on the motion of either party.
<br>

<br>
<br>(d) Tolling of Limitations Period.—If a claim is filed with the Secretary of Transportation, the running of the limitations period for bringing a civil action is suspended until the Secretary denies the claim, and for 60 days thereafter. The Secretary is deemed to have denied the claim if the Secretary does not act on the claim within 6 months after the claim is filed, unless the Secretary for good cause shown agrees with the claimant on a different period for the Secretary to act on the claim.
<br>
<br>(e) Interpleader.—If the Secretary acknowledges the indebtedness of the Government under the insurance and there is a dispute about the persons entitled to receive payment, the Government may bring a civil action interpleading those persons. The action shall be brought in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or in the district court for the district in which any of those persons resides. A person not residing or found in the district may be made a party by service in any reasonable manner the court directs. If the court is satisfied that unknown persons might make a claim under the insurance, the court may direct service on those unknown persons by publication in the Federal Register. Judgment after service by publication in the Federal Register discharges the Government from further liability to all persons.
