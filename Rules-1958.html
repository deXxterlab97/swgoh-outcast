<br>§4106. Orders
<br>
<br>(a) Application.—This section applies to task and delivery order contracts entered into under sections 4103 and 4105 of this title.
<br>
<br>(b) Actions Not Required for Issuance of Orders.—The following actions are not required for issuance of a task or delivery order under a task or delivery order contract:
<br>
<br>(1) A separate notice for the order under section 1708 of this title or section 8(e) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(e)).
<br>
<br>(2) Except as provided in subsection (c), a competition (or a waiver of competition approved in accordance with section 3304(e) of this title) that is separate from that used for entering into the contract.
<br>
<br>(c) Multiple Award Contracts.—When multiple contracts are awarded under section 4103(d)(1)(B) or 4105(f) of this title, all contractors awarded the contracts shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered, pursuant to procedures set forth in the contracts, for each task or delivery order in excess of the micro-purchase threshold under section 1902 of this title that is to be issued under any of the contracts, unless—
<br>
<br>(1) the executive agency's need for the services or property ordered is of such unusual urgency that providing the opportunity to all of those contractors would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling that need;
<br>
<br>(2) only one of those contractors is capable of providing the services or property required at the level of quality required because the services or property ordered are unique or highly specialized;
<br>
<br>(3) the task or delivery order should be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to a task or delivery order already issued on a competitive basis; or
<br>
<br>(4) it is necessary to place the order with a particular contractor to satisfy a minimum guarantee.
<br>
<br>(d) Enhanced Competition for Orders in Excess of $5,000,000.—In the case of a task or delivery order in excess of $5,000,000, the requirement to provide all contractors a fair opportunity to be considered under subsection (c) is not met unless all such contractors are provided, at a minimum—
<br>
<br>(1) a notice of the task or delivery order that includes a clear statement of the executive agency's requirements;
<br>
<br>(2) a reasonable period of time to provide a proposal in response to the notice;
<br>
<br>(3) disclosure of the significant factors and subfactors, including cost or price, that the executive agency expects to consider in evaluating such proposals, and their relative importance;
<br>
<br>(4) in the case of an award that is to be made on a best value basis, a written statement documenting—
<br>
<br>(A) the basis for the award; and
<br>
<br>(B) the relative importance of quality and price or cost factors; and
<br>
<br>(5) an opportunity for a post-award debriefing consistent with the requirements of section 3704 of this title.
<br>
<br>(e) Statement of Work.—A task or delivery order shall include a statement of work that clearly specifies all tasks to be performed or property to be delivered under the order.
<br>
<br>(f) Protests.—
<br>
<br>(1) Protest not authorized.—A protest is not authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of a task or delivery order except for—
<br>
<br>(A) a protest on the ground that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract under which the order is issued; or
<br>
<br>(B) a protest of an order valued in excess of $10,000,000.
<br>
<br>(2) Jurisdiction over protests.—Notwithstanding section 3556 of title 31, the Comptroller General shall have exclusive jurisdiction of a protest authorized under paragraph (1)(B).
<br>
<br>(g) Task and Delivery Order Ombudsman.—
<br>
<br>(1) Appointment or designation and responsibilities.—The head of each executive agency who awards multiple task or delivery order contracts under section 4103(d)(1)(B) or 4105(f) of this title shall appoint or designate a task and delivery order ombudsman who shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors on those contracts and ensuring that all of the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered for task or delivery orders when required under subsection (c).
<br>
<br>(2) Who is eligible.—The task and delivery order ombudsman shall be a senior agency official who is independent of the contracting officer for the contracts and may be the executive agency's advocate for competition.

<br>§4303. Effect of submission of unallowable costs
<br>
<br>(a) Indirect Cost That Violates Federal Acquisition Regulation Cost Principle.—An executive agency shall require that a covered contract provide that if the contractor submits to the executive agency a proposal for settlement of indirect costs incurred by the contractor for any period after those costs have been accrued and if that proposal includes the submission of a cost that is unallowable because the cost violates a cost principle in the Federal Acquisition Regulation or an executive agency supplement to the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the cost shall be disallowed.
<br>
<br>(b) Penalty for Violation of Cost Principle.—
<br>
<br>(1) Unallowable cost in proposal.—If the executive agency determines that a cost submitted by a contractor in its proposal for settlement is expressly unallowable under a cost principle referred to in subsection (a) that defines the allowability of specific selected costs, the executive agency shall assess a penalty against the contractor in an amount equal to—
<br>
<br>(A) the amount of the disallowed cost allocated to covered contracts for which a proposal for settlement of indirect costs has been submitted; plus
<br>
<br>(B) interest (to be computed based on provisions in the Federal Acquisition Regulation) to compensate the Federal Government for the use of the amount which a contractor has been paid in excess of the amount to which the contractor was entitled.
<br>
<br>(2) Cost determined to be unallowable before proposal submitted.—If the executive agency determines that a proposal for settlement of indirect costs submitted by a contractor includes a cost determined to be unallowable in the case of that contractor before the submission of that proposal, the executive agency shall assess a penalty against the contractor in an amount equal to 2 times the amount of the disallowed cost allocated to covered contracts for which a proposal for settlement of indirect costs has been submitted.
<br>
<br>(c) Waiver of Penalty.—The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall provide for a penalty under subsection (b) to be waived in the case of a contractor's proposal for settlement of indirect costs when—
<br>
<br>(1) the contractor withdraws the proposal before the formal initiation of an audit of the proposal by the Federal Government and resubmits a revised proposal;
<br>
<br>(2) the amount of unallowable costs subject to the penalty is insignificant; or
<br>
<br>(3) the contractor demonstrates, to the contracting officer's satisfaction, that—
<br>
<br>(A) it has established appropriate policies and personnel training and an internal control and review system that provide assurances that unallowable costs subject to penalties are precluded from being included in the contractor's proposal for settlement of indirect costs; and
<br>
<br>(B) the unallowable costs subject to the penalty were inadvertently incorporated into the proposal.
<br>
<br>(d) Applicability of Contract Disputes Procedure.—An action of an executive agency under subsection (a) or (b)—
<br>
<br>(1) shall be considered a final decision for the purposes of section 7103 of this title; and
<br>
<br>(2) is appealable in the manner provided in section 7104(a) of this title.

<br>(4) Payments of fines and penalties resulting from violations of, or failure to comply with, Federal, State, local, or foreign laws and regulations, except when incurred as a result of compliance with specific terms and conditions of the contract or specific written instructions from the contracting officer authorizing in advance those payments in accordance with applicable provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.

<br>
<br>(14) Costs of severance pay paid by the contractor to a foreign national employed by the contractor under a service contract performed in a foreign country if the termination of the employment of the foreign national is the result of the closing of, or the curtailment of activities at, a Federal Government facility in that country at the request of the government of that country.
<br>
<br>(15) Costs incurred by a contractor or subcontractor, or personal service 1 contractor in connection with any criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding commenced by the Federal Government or a State, to the extent provided in section 4310 of this title.

<br>
<br>(16) 2 Costs of compensation of contractor and subcontractor employees for a fiscal year, regardless of the contract funding source, to the extent that such compensation exceeds $487,000 per year, adjusted annually to reflect the change in the Employment Cost Index for all workers, as calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, except that the head of an executive agency may establish one or more narrowly targeted exceptions for scientists, engineers, or other specialists upon a determination that such exceptions are needed to ensure that the executive agency has continued access to needed skills and capabilities.
<br>
<br>(b) Waiver of Severance Pay Restrictions for Foreign Nationals.—
<br>
<br>(1) Executive agency determination.—Pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation and subject to the availability of appropriations, an executive agency, in awarding a covered contract, may waive the application of paragraphs (13) and (14) of subsection (a) to that contract if the executive agency determines that—
<br>
<br>(A) the application of those provisions to that contract would adversely affect the continuation of a program, project, or activity that provides significant support services for employees of the executive agency posted outside the United States;
<br>
<br>(B) the contractor has taken (or has established plans to take) appropriate actions within the contractor's control to minimize the amount and number of incidents of the payment of severance pay by the contractor to employees under the contract who are foreign nationals; and
<br>
<br>(C) the payment of severance pay is necessary to comply with a law that is generally applicable to a significant number of businesses in the country in which the foreign national receiving the payment performed services under the contract or is necessary to comply with a collective bargaining agreement.
<br>
<br>(2) Solicitation to include statement about waiver.—An executive agency shall include in the solicitation for a covered contract a statement indicating—
<br>
<br>(A) that a waiver has been granted under paragraph (1) for the contract; or

<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13494, Jan. 30, 2009, 74 F.R. 6101, as amended by Ex. Ord. No. 13517, §2, Oct. 30, 2009, 74 F.R. 57239, provided:
<br>
<br>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, 40 U.S.C. 101 et seq., it is hereby ordered that:
<br>
<br>Section 1. To promote economy and efficiency in Government contracting, certain costs that are not directly related to the contractors' provision of goods and services to the Government shall be unallowable for payment, thereby directly reducing Government expenditures. This order is also consistent with the policy of the United States to remain impartial concerning any labor-management dispute involving Government contractors. This order does not restrict the manner in which recipients of Federal funds may expend those funds.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. It is the policy of the executive branch in procuring goods and services that, to ensure the economical and efficient administration of Government contracts, contracting departments and agencies, when they enter into, receive proposals for, or make disbursements pursuant to a contract as to which certain costs are treated as unallowable, shall treat as unallowable the costs of any activities undertaken to persuade employees—whether employees of the recipient of the Federal disbursements or of any other entity—to exercise or not to exercise, or concerning the manner of exercising, the right to organize and bargain collectively through representatives of the employees' own choosing. Such unallowable costs shall be excluded from any billing, claim, proposal, or disbursement applicable to any such Federal Government contract.
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. Contracting departments and agencies shall treat as allowable costs incurred in maintaining satisfactory relations between the contractor and its employees (other than the costs of any activities undertaken to persuade employees to exercise or not to exercise, or concerning the manner of exercising, the right to organize and bargain collectively), including costs of labor management committees, employee publications, and other related activities. See 48 C.F.R. 31.205–21.
<br>
<br>Sec. 4. Examples of costs unallowable under section 2 of this order include the costs of the following activities, when they are undertaken to persuade employees to exercise or not to exercise, or concern the manner of exercising, rights to organize and bargain collectively:
<br>
<br>(a) preparing and distributing materials;
<br>
<br>(b) hiring or consulting legal counsel or consultants;
<br>
<br>(c) holding meetings (including paying the salaries of the attendees at meetings held for this purpose); and
<br>
<br>(d) planning or conducting activities by managers, supervisors, or union representatives during work hours.
<br>
<br>Sec. 5. Within 150 days of the effective date of this order, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council (FAR Council) shall adopt such rules and regulations and issue such orders as are deemed necessary and appropriate to carry out this order. Such rules, regulations, and orders shall minimize the costs of compliance for contractors and shall not interfere with the ability of contractors to engage in advocacy through activities for which they do not claim reimbursement.
<br>
<br>Sec. 6. Each contracting department or agency shall cooperate with the FAR Council and provide such information and assistance as the FAR Council may require in the performance of its functions under this order.
<br>
<br>Sec. 7. (a) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
<br>
<br>(b) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
<br>
<br>Sec. 8. This order shall become effective immediately, and shall apply to contracts resulting from solicitations issued on or after the effective date of the action taken by the FAR Council under section 5 of this order.

<br>
<br>(b) Recommendation To Reduce or Suspend Payments.—In any case in which the remedy coordination official of an executive agency finds that there is substantial evidence that the request of a contractor for advance, partial, or progress payment under a contract awarded by that executive agency is based on fraud, the remedy coordination official shall recommend that the executive agency reduce or suspend further payments to that contractor.
<br>
<br>(c) Reduction or Suspension of Payments.—The head of an executive agency receiving a recommendation under subsection (b) in the case of a contractor's request for payment under a contract shall determine whether there is substantial evidence that the request is based on fraud.

<br>
<br>(d) Extent of Reduction or Suspension.—The extent of any reduction or suspension of payments by an executive agency under subsection (c) on the basis of fraud shall be reasonably commensurate with the anticipated loss to the Federal Government resulting from the fraud.
<br>

<br>
<br>(f) Notice.—The head of each executive agency shall prescribe procedures to ensure that, before the head of the executive agency decides to reduce or suspend payments in the case of a contractor under subsection (c), the contractor is afforded notice of the proposed reduction or suspension and an opportunity to submit matters to the executive agency in response to the proposed reduction or suspension.

<br>§4703. Validation of proprietary data restrictions
<br>
<br>(a) Contract That Provides for Delivery of Technical Data.—A contract for property or services entered into by an executive agency that provides for the delivery of technical data shall provide that—
<br>
<br>(1) a contractor or subcontractor at any tier shall be prepared to furnish to the contracting officer a written justification for any restriction the contractor or subcontractor asserts on the right of the Federal Government to use the data; and
<br>
<br>(2) the contracting officer may review the validity of a restriction the contractor or subcontractor asserts under the contract on the right of the Federal Government to use technical data furnished to the Federal Government under the contract if the contracting officer determines that reasonable grounds exist to question the current validity of the asserted restriction and that the continued adherence to the asserted restriction by the Federal Government would make it impracticable to procure the item competitively at a later time.
<br>
<br>(b) Challenge of Restriction.—If after a review the contracting officer determines that a challenge to the asserted restriction is warranted, the contracting officer shall provide written notice to the contractor or subcontractor asserting the restriction. The notice shall state—
<br>
<br>(1) the grounds for challenging the asserted restriction; and
<br>
<br>(2) the requirement for a response within 60 days justifying the current validity of the asserted restriction.
<br>
<br>(c) Additional Time for Responses.—If a contractor or subcontractor asserting a restriction subject to this section submits to the contracting officer a written request showing the need for additional time to comply with the requirement to justify the current validity of the asserted restriction, the contracting officer shall provide appropriate additional time to adequately permit the justification to be submitted.
<br>
<br>(d) Multiple Challenges.—If a party asserting a restriction receives notices of challenges to restrictions on technical data from more than one contracting officer, and notifies each contracting officer of the existence of more than one challenge, the contracting officer initiating the earliest challenge, after consultation with the party asserting the restriction and the other contracting officers, shall formulate a schedule of responses to each of the challenges that will afford the party asserting the restriction with an equitable opportunity to respond to each challenge.
<br>
<br>(e) Decision on Validity of Asserted Restriction.—
<br>
<br>(1) No response submitted.—The contracting officer shall issue a decision pertaining to the validity of the asserted restriction if the contractor or subcontractor does not submit a response under subsection (b).
<br>
<br>(2) Response submitted.—Within 60 days of receipt of a justification submitted in response to the notice provided pursuant to subsection (b), a contracting officer shall issue a decision or notify the party asserting the restriction of the time within which a decision will be issued.
<br>
<br>(f) Claim Deemed Claim Within Chapter 71.—A claim pertaining to the validity of the asserted restriction that is submitted in writing to a contracting officer by a contractor or subcontractor at any tier is deemed to be a claim within the meaning of chapter 71 of this title.
<br>
<br>(g) Final Disposition of Challenge.—
<br>
<br>(1) Challenge is sustained.—If the contracting officer's challenge to the restriction on the right of the Federal Government to use technical data is sustained on final disposition—
<br>
<br>(A) the restriction is cancelled; and
<br>
<br>(B) if the asserted restriction is found not to be substantially justified, the contractor or subcontractor, as appropriate, is liable to the Federal Government for payment of the cost to the Federal Government of reviewing the asserted restriction and the fees and other expenses (as defined in section 2412(d)(2)(A) of title 28) incurred by the Federal Government in challenging the asserted restriction, unless special circumstances would make the payment unjust.
<br>
<br>(2) Challenge not sustained.—If the contracting officer's challenge to the restriction on the right of the Federal Government to use technical data is not sustained on final disposition, the Federal Government—
<br>
<br>(A) continues to be bound by the restriction; and
<br>
<br>(B) is liable for payment to the party asserting the restriction for fees and other expenses (as defined in section 2412(d)(2)(A) of title 28) incurred by the party asserting the restriction in defending the asserted restriction if the challenge by the Federal Government is found not to be made in good faith.

<br>§4704. Prohibition of contractors limiting subcontractor sales directly to Federal Government
<br>
<br>(a) Contract Restrictions.—Each contract for the purchase of property or services made by an executive agency shall provide that the contractor will not—
<br>
<br>(1) enter into an agreement with a subcontractor under the contract that has the effect of unreasonably restricting sales by the subcontractor directly to the Federal Government of any item or process (including computer software) made or furnished by the subcontractor under the contract (or any follow-on production contract); or
<br>
<br>(2) otherwise act to restrict unreasonably the ability of a subcontractor to make sales described in paragraph (1) to the Federal Government.
<br>
<br>(b) Rights Under Law Preserved.—This section does not prohibit a contractor from asserting rights it otherwise has under law.
<br>
<br>(c) Inapplicability to Certain Contracts.—This section does not apply to a contract for an amount that is not greater than the simplified acquisition threshold.
<br>
<br>(d) Inapplicability When Government Treated Similarly to Other Purchasers.—An agreement between the contractor in a contract for the acquisition of commercial products or commercial services and a subcontractor under the contract that restricts sales by the subcontractor directly to persons other than the contractor may not be considered to unreasonably restrict sales by that subcontractor to the Federal Government in violation of the provision included in the contract pursuant to subsection (a) if the agreement does not result in the Federal Government being treated differently with regard to the restriction than any other prospective purchaser of the commercial products or commercial services from that subcontractor.

<br>(1) Contract.—The term "contract" means a contract awarded by the head of an executive agency.
<br>
<br>(2) Contractor.—The term "contractor" means a person awarded a contract with an executive agency.
<br>
<br>(3) Inspector general.—The term "Inspector General" means an Inspector General appointed under the Inspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App.).
<br>
<br>(b) Prohibition of Reprisals.—An employee of a contractor may not be discharged, demoted, or otherwise discriminated against as a reprisal for disclosing to a Member of Congress or an authorized official of an executive agency or the Department of Justice information relating to a substantial violation of law related to a contract (including the competition for, or negotiation of, a contract).
<br>
<br>(c) Investigation of Complaints.—An individual who believes that the individual has been subjected to a reprisal prohibited by subsection (b) may submit a complaint to the Inspector General of the executive agency. Unless the Inspector General determines that the complaint is frivolous, the Inspector General shall investigate the complaint and, on completion of the investigation, submit a report of the findings of the investigation to the individual, the contractor concerned, and the head of the agency. If the executive agency does not have an Inspector General, the duties of the Inspector General under this section shall be performed by an official designated by the head of the executive agency.
<br>
<br>(d) Remedy and Enforcement Authority.—
<br>
<br>(1) Actions contractor may be ordered to take.—If the head of an executive agency determines that a contractor has subjected an individual to a reprisal prohibited by subsection (b), the head of the executive agency may take one or more of the following actions:
<br>
<br>(A) Abatement.—Order the contractor to take affirmative action to abate the reprisal.
<br>
<br>(B) Reinstatement.—Order the contractor to reinstate the individual to the position that the individual held before the reprisal, together with the compensation (including back pay), employment benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment that would apply to the individual in that position if the reprisal had not been taken.
<br>
<br>(C) Payment.—Order the contractor to pay the complainant an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and expert witnesses' fees) that the complainant reasonably incurred for, or in connection with, bringing the complaint regarding the reprisal, as determined by the head of the executive agency.
<br>
<br>(2) Enforcement order.—When a contractor fails to comply with an order issued under paragraph (1), the head of the executive agency shall file an action for enforcement of the order in the United States district court for a district in which the reprisal was found to have occurred. In an action brought under this paragraph, the court may grant appropriate relief, including injunctive relief and compensatory and exemplary damages.
<br>
<br>(3) Review of enforcement order.—A person adversely affected or aggrieved by an order issued under paragraph (1) may obtain review of the order's conformance with this subsection, and regulations issued to carry out this section, in the United States court of appeals for a circuit in which the reprisal is alleged in the order to have occurred. A petition seeking review must be filed no more than 60 days after the head of the agency issues the order. Review shall conform to chapter 7 of title 5.
<br>
<br>(e) Scope of Section.—This section does not—
<br>
<br>(1) authorize the discharge of, demotion of, or discrimination against an employee for a disclosure other than a disclosure protected by subsection (b); or
<br>
<br>(2) modify or derogate from a right or remedy otherwise available to the employee.
<br>
<br>(f) Four-year Suspension of Effectiveness While Pilot Program Is in Effect.—While section 4712 1 of this title is in effect, this section shall not be in effect.
