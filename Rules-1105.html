<br>A regulation establishing a tobacco product standard shall set forth the date or dates upon which the standard shall take effect, but no such regulation may take effect before 1 year after the date of its publication unless the Secretary determines that an earlier effective date is necessary for the protection of the public health. Such date or dates shall be established so as to minimize, consistent with the public health, economic loss to, and disruption or dislocation of, domestic and international trade. In establishing such effective date or dates, the Secretary shall consider information submitted in connection with a proposed product standard by interested parties, including manufacturers and tobacco growers, regarding the technical achievability of compliance with the standard, and including information concerning the existence of patents that make it impossible to comply in the timeframe envisioned in the proposed standard. If the Secretary determines, based on the Secretary's evaluation of submitted comments, that a product standard can be met only by manufacturers requiring substantial changes to the methods of farming the domestically grown tobacco used by the manufacturer, the effective date of that product standard shall be not less than 2 years after the date of publication of the final regulation establishing the standard.
<br>(3) Limitation on power granted to the Food and Drug Administration
<br>
<br>Because of the importance of a decision of the Secretary to issue a regulation—
<br>
<br>(A) banning all cigarettes, all smokeless tobacco products, all little cigars, all cigars other than little cigars, all pipe tobacco, or all roll-your-own tobacco products; or
<br>
<br>(B) requiring the reduction of nicotine yields of a tobacco product to zero,
<br>
<br>the Secretary is prohibited from taking such actions under this chapter.
<br>(4) Amendment; revocation
<br>(A) Authority
<br>
<br>The Secretary, upon the Secretary's own initiative or upon petition of an interested person, may by a regulation, promulgated in accordance with the requirements of subsection (c) and paragraph (2), amend or revoke a tobacco product standard.
<br>(B) Effective date
<br>
<br>The Secretary may declare a proposed amendment of a tobacco product standard to be effective on and after its publication in the Federal Register and until the effective date of any final action taken on such amendment if the Secretary determines that making it so effective is in the public interest.
<br>(5) Referral to Advisory Committee
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary may refer a proposed regulation for the establishment, amendment, or revocation of a tobacco product standard to the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee for a report and recommendation with respect to any matter involved in the proposed regulation which requires the exercise of scientific judgment.
<br>(B) Initiation of referral
<br>
<br>The Secretary may make a referral under this paragraph—
<br>
<br>(i) on the Secretary's own initiative; or
<br>
<br>(ii) upon the request of an interested person that—
<br>
<br>(I) demonstrates good cause for the referral; and
<br>
<br>(II) is made before the expiration of the period for submission of comments on the proposed regulation.
<br>(C) Provision of data
<br>
<br>If a proposed regulation is referred under this paragraph to the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee, the Secretary shall provide the Advisory Committee with the data and information on which such proposed regulation is based.
<br>(D) Report and recommendation
<br>
<br>The Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee shall, within 60 days after the referral of a proposed regulation under this paragraph and after independent study of the data and information furnished to it by the Secretary and other data and information before it, submit to the Secretary a report and recommendation respecting such regulation, together with all underlying data and information and a statement of the reason or basis for the recommendation.
<br>(E) Public availability
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall make a copy of each report and recommendation under subparagraph (D) publicly available.
<br>(e) Menthol cigarettes
<br>(1) Referral; considerations
<br>
<br>Immediately upon the establishment of the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee under section 387q(a) of this title, the Secretary shall refer to the Committee for report and recommendation, under section 387q(c)(4) of this title, the issue of the impact of the use of menthol in cigarettes on the public health, including such use among children, African-Americans, Hispanics, and other racial and ethnic minorities. In its review, the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee shall address the considerations listed in subsections (a)(3)(B)(i) and (b).
<br>(2) Report and recommendation
<br>
<br>Not later than 1 year after its establishment, the Tobacco Product Scientific Advisory Committee shall submit to the Secretary the report and recommendations required pursuant to paragraph (1).
<br>(3) Rule of construction

<br>(f) Dissolvable tobacco products
<br>(1) Referral; considerations
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall refer to the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee for report and recommendation, under section 387q(c)(4) of this title, the issue of the nature and impact of the use of dissolvable tobacco products on the public health, including such use among children. In its review, the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee shall address the considerations listed in subsection (a)(3)(B)(i).
<br>(2) Report and recommendation
<br>
<br>Not later than 2 years after its establishment, the Tobacco Product Scientific Advisory Committee shall submit to the Secretary the report and recommendations required pursuant to paragraph (1).

<br>§387h. Notification and other remedies
<br>(a) Notification
<br>
<br>If the Secretary determines that—
<br>
<br>(1) a tobacco product which is introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce for commercial distribution presents an unreasonable risk of substantial harm to the public health; and
<br>
<br>(2) notification under this subsection is necessary to eliminate the unreasonable risk of such harm and no more practicable means is available under the provisions of this subchapter (other than this section) to eliminate such risk,
<br>
<br>the Secretary may issue such order as may be necessary to assure that adequate notification is provided in an appropriate form, by the persons and means best suited under the circumstances involved, to all persons who should properly receive such notification in order to eliminate such risk. The Secretary may order notification by any appropriate means, including public service announcements. Before issuing an order under this subsection, the Secretary shall consult with the persons who are to give notice under the order.
<br>(b) No exemption from other liability
<br>
<br>Compliance with an order issued under this section shall not relieve any person from liability under Federal or State law. In awarding damages for economic loss in an action brought for the enforcement of any such liability, the value to the plaintiff in such action of any remedy provided under such order shall be taken into account.
<br>(c) Recall authority
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>If the Secretary finds that there is a reasonable probability that a tobacco product contains a manufacturing or other defect not ordinarily contained in tobacco products on the market that would cause serious, adverse health consequences or death, the Secretary shall issue an order requiring the appropriate person (including the manufacturers, importers, distributors, or retailers of the tobacco product) to immediately cease distribution of such tobacco product. The order shall provide the person subject to the order with an opportunity for an informal hearing, to be held not later than 10 days after the date of the issuance of the order, on the actions required by the order and on whether the order should be amended to require a recall of such tobacco product. If, after providing an opportunity for such a hearing, the Secretary determines that inadequate grounds exist to support the actions required by the order, the Secretary shall vacate the order.
<br>(2) Amendment of order to require recall
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>If, after providing an opportunity for an informal hearing under paragraph (1), the Secretary determines that the order should be amended to include a recall of the tobacco product with respect to which the order was issued, the Secretary shall, except as provided in subparagraph (B), amend the order to require a recall. The Secretary shall specify a timetable in which the tobacco product recall will occur and shall require periodic reports to the Secretary describing the progress of the recall.
<br>(B) Notice
<br>
<br>An amended order under subparagraph (A)—
<br>
<br>(i) shall not include recall of a tobacco product from individuals; and
<br>
<br>(ii) shall provide for notice to persons subject to the risks associated with the use of such tobacco product.
<br>
<br>In providing the notice required by clause (ii), the Secretary may use the assistance of retailers and other persons who distributed such tobacco product. If a significant number of such persons cannot be identified, the Secretary shall notify such persons under section 375(b) of this title.
<br>(3) Remedy not exclusive
<br>
<br>The remedy provided by this subsection shall be in addition to remedies provided by subsection (a).

<br>§387i. Records and reports on tobacco products
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>Every person who is a tobacco product manufacturer or importer of a tobacco product shall establish and maintain such records, make such reports, and provide such information, as the Secretary may by regulation reasonably require to assure that such tobacco product is not adulterated or misbranded and to otherwise protect public health. Regulations prescribed under the preceding sentence—
<br>
<br>(1) may require a tobacco product manufacturer or importer to report to the Secretary whenever the manufacturer or importer receives or otherwise becomes aware of information that reasonably suggests that one of its marketed tobacco products may have caused or contributed to a serious unexpected adverse experience associated with the use of the product or any significant increase in the frequency of a serious, expected adverse product experience;
<br>
<br>(2) shall require reporting of other significant adverse tobacco product experiences as determined by the Secretary to be necessary to be reported;
<br>
<br>(3) shall not impose requirements unduly burdensome to a tobacco product manufacturer or importer, taking into account the cost of complying with such requirements and the need for the protection of the public health and the implementation of this subchapter;
<br>
<br>(4) when prescribing the procedure for making requests for reports or information, shall require that each request made under such regulations for submission of a report or information to the Secretary state the reason or purpose for such request and identify to the fullest extent practicable such report or information;
<br>
<br>(5) when requiring submission of a report or information to the Secretary, shall state the reason or purpose for the submission of such report or information and identify to the fullest extent practicable such report or information; and
<br>
<br>(6) may not require that the identity of any patient or user be disclosed in records, reports, or information required under this subsection unless required for the medical welfare of an individual, to determine risks to public health of a tobacco product, or to verify a record, report, or information submitted under this subchapter.
<br>
<br>In prescribing regulations under this subsection, the Secretary shall have due regard for the professional ethics of the medical profession and the interests of patients. The prohibitions of paragraph (6) continue to apply to records, reports, and information concerning any individual who has been a patient, irrespective of whether or when he ceases to be a patient.
<br>(b) Reports of removals and corrections
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in paragraph (2), the Secretary shall by regulation require a tobacco product manufacturer or importer of a tobacco product to report promptly to the Secretary any corrective action taken or removal from the market of a tobacco product undertaken by such manufacturer or importer if the removal or correction was undertaken—
<br>
<br>(A) to reduce a risk to health posed by the tobacco product; or
<br>
<br>(B) to remedy a violation of this subchapter caused by the tobacco product which may present a risk to health.
<br>
<br>A tobacco product manufacturer or importer of a tobacco product who undertakes a corrective action or removal from the market of a tobacco product which is not required to be reported under this subsection shall keep a record of such correction or removal.
<br>(2) Exception
<br>
<br>No report of the corrective action or removal of a tobacco product may be required under paragraph (1) if a report of the corrective action or removal is required and has been submitted under subsection (a).

<br>
<br>(A) any tobacco product (including those products in test markets) that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007; or
<br>
<br>(B) any modification (including a change in design, any component, any part, or any constituent, including a smoke constituent, or in the content, delivery or form of nicotine, or any other additive or ingredient) of a tobacco product where the modified product was commercially marketed in the United States after February 15, 2007.
<br>(2) Premarket review required
<br>(A) New products
<br>
<br>An order under subsection (c)(1)(A)(i) for a new tobacco product is required unless—
<br>
<br>(i) the manufacturer has submitted a report under section 387e(j) of this title; and the Secretary has issued an order that the tobacco product—
<br>
<br>(I) is substantially equivalent to a tobacco product commercially marketed (other than for test marketing) in the United States as of February 15, 2007; and
<br>
<br>(II) is in compliance with the requirements of this chapter; or
<br>
<br>(ii) the tobacco product is exempt from the requirements of section 387e(j) of this title pursuant to a regulation issued under section 387e(j)(3) of this title.
<br>(B) Application to certain post-February 15, 2007, products
<br>
<br>Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to a tobacco product—
<br>
<br>(i) that was first introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce for commercial distribution in the United States after February 15, 2007, and prior to the date that is 21 months after June 22, 2009; and
<br>
<br>(ii) for which a report was submitted under section 387e(j) of this title within such 21-month period,

<br>except that subparagraph (A) shall apply to the tobacco product if the Secretary issues an order that the tobacco product is not substantially equivalent.
<br>(3) Substantially equivalent defined
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>In this section and section 387e(j) of this title, the term "substantially equivalent" or "substantial equivalence" means, with respect to the tobacco product being compared to the predicate tobacco product, that the Secretary by order has found that the tobacco product—
<br>
<br>(i) has the same characteristics as the predicate tobacco product; or
<br>
<br>(ii) has different characteristics and the information submitted contains information, including clinical data if deemed necessary by the Secretary, that demonstrates that it is not appropriate to regulate the product under this section because the product does not raise different questions of public health.
<br>(B) Characteristics
<br>
<br>In subparagraph (A), the term "characteristics" means the materials, ingredients, design, composition, heating source, or other features of a tobacco product.
<br>(C) Limitation
<br>
<br>A tobacco product may not be found to be substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product that has been removed from the market at the initiative of the Secretary or that has been determined by a judicial order to be misbranded or adulterated.
<br>(4) Health information
<br>(A) Summary
<br>
<br>As part of a submission under section 387e(j) of this title respecting a tobacco product, the person required to file a premarket notification under such section shall provide an adequate summary of any health information related to the tobacco product or state that such information will be made available upon request by any person.

<br>(1) Contents
<br>
<br>An application under this section shall contain—
<br>
<br>(A) full reports of all information, published or known to, or which should reasonably be known to, the applicant, concerning investigations which have been made to show the health risks of such tobacco product and whether such tobacco product presents less risk than other tobacco products;
<br>
<br>(B) a full statement of the components, ingredients, additives, and properties, and of the principle or principles of operation, of such tobacco product;
<br>
<br>(C) a full description of the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, and, when relevant, packing and installation of, such tobacco product;
<br>
<br>(D) an identifying reference to any tobacco product standard under section 387g of this title which would be applicable to any aspect of such tobacco product, and either adequate information to show that such aspect of such tobacco product fully meets such tobacco product standard or adequate information to justify any deviation from such standard;
<br>
<br>(E) such samples of such tobacco product and of components thereof as the Secretary may reasonably require;
<br>
<br>(F) specimens of the labeling proposed to be used for such tobacco product; and
<br>

<br>Upon receipt of an application meeting the requirements set forth in paragraph (1), the Secretary—
<br>
<br>(A) may, on the Secretary's own initiative; or
<br>
<br>(B) may, upon the request of an applicant,
<br>
<br>refer such application to the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee for reference and for submission (within such period as the Secretary may establish) of a report and recommendation respecting the application, together with all underlying data and the reasons or basis for the recommendation.
<br>(c) Action on application
<br>(1) Deadline
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>As promptly as possible, but in no event later than 180 days after the receipt of an application under subsection (b), the Secretary, after considering the report and recommendation submitted under subsection (b)(2), shall—
<br>
<br>(i) issue an order that the new product may be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce if the Secretary finds that none of the grounds specified in paragraph (2) of this subsection applies; or
<br>
<br>(ii) issue an order that the new product may not be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce if the Secretary finds (and sets forth the basis for such finding as part of or accompanying such denial) that 1 or more grounds for denial specified in paragraph (2) of this subsection apply.
<br>(B) Restrictions on sale and distribution
<br>
<br>An order under subparagraph (A)(i) may require that the sale and distribution of the tobacco product be restricted but only to the extent that the sale and distribution of a tobacco product may be restricted under a regulation under section 387f(d) of this title.
<br>(2) Denial of application
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall deny an application submitted under subsection (b) if, upon the basis of the information submitted to the Secretary as part of the application and any other information before the Secretary with respect to such tobacco product, the Secretary finds that—
<br>
<br>(A) there is a lack of a showing that permitting such tobacco product to be marketed would be appropriate for the protection of the public health;
<br>
<br>(B) the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, the manufacture, processing, or packing of such tobacco product do not conform to the requirements of section 387f(e) of this title;
<br>
<br>(C) based on a fair evaluation of all material facts, the proposed labeling is false or misleading in any particular; or
<br>
<br>(D) such tobacco product is not shown to conform in all respects to a tobacco product standard in effect under section 387g of this title, and there is a lack of adequate information to justify the deviation from such standard.
<br>(3) Denial information
<br>
<br>Any denial of an application shall, insofar as the Secretary determines to be practicable, be accompanied by a statement informing the applicant of the measures required to remove such application from deniable form (which measures may include further research by the applicant in accordance with 1 or more protocols prescribed by the Secretary).
<br>(4) Basis for finding
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, the finding as to whether the marketing of a tobacco product for which an application has been submitted is appropriate for the protection of the public health shall be determined with respect to the risks and benefits to the population as a whole, including users and nonusers of the tobacco product, and taking into account—
<br>
<br>(A) the increased or decreased likelihood that existing users of tobacco products will stop using such products; and
<br>
<br>(B) the increased or decreased likelihood that those who do not use tobacco products will start using such products.
<br>(5) Basis for action
<br>(A) Investigations
<br>
<br>For purposes of paragraph (2)(A), whether permitting a tobacco product to be marketed would be appropriate for the protection of the public health shall, when appropriate, be determined on the basis of well-controlled investigations, which may include 1 or more clinical investigations by experts qualified by training and experience to evaluate the tobacco product.
<br>(B) Other evidence
<br>
<br>If the Secretary determines that there exists valid scientific evidence (other than evidence derived from investigations described in subparagraph (A)) which is sufficient to evaluate the tobacco product, the Secretary may authorize that the determination for purposes of paragraph (2)(A) be made on the basis of such evidence.
<br>(d) Withdrawal and temporary suspension
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall, upon obtaining, where appropriate, advice on scientific matters from the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee, and after due notice and opportunity for informal hearing for a tobacco product for which an order was issued under subsection (c)(1)(A)(i), issue an order withdrawing the order if the Secretary finds—
<br>
<br>(A) that the continued marketing of such tobacco product no longer is appropriate for the protection of the public health;
<br>
<br>(B) that the application contained or was accompanied by an untrue statement of a material fact;
<br>
<br>(C) that the applicant—
<br>
<br>(i) has failed to establish a system for maintaining records, or has repeatedly or deliberately failed to maintain records or to make reports, required by an applicable regulation under section 387i of this title;
<br>
<br>(ii) has refused to permit access to, or copying or verification of, such records as required by section 374 of this title; or
<br>
<br>(iii) has not complied with the requirements of section 387e of this title;
<br>
<br>(D) on the basis of new information before the Secretary with respect to such tobacco product, evaluated together with the evidence before the Secretary when the application was reviewed, that the methods used in, or the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, packing, or installation of such tobacco product do not conform with the requirements of section 387f(e) of this title and were not brought into conformity with such requirements within a reasonable time after receipt of written notice from the Secretary of nonconformity;
<br>
<br>(E) on the basis of new information before the Secretary, evaluated together with the evidence before the Secretary when the application was reviewed, that the labeling of such tobacco product, based on a fair evaluation of all material facts, is false or misleading in any particular and was not corrected within a reasonable time after receipt of written notice from the Secretary of such fact; or
<br>
<br>(F) on the basis of new information before the Secretary, evaluated together with the evidence before the Secretary when such order was issued, that such tobacco product is not shown to conform in all respects to a tobacco product standard which is in effect under section 387g of this title, compliance with which was a condition to the issuance of an order relating to the application, and that there is a lack of adequate information to justify the deviation from such standard.
<br>(2) Appeal
<br>
<br>The holder of an application subject to an order issued under paragraph (1) withdrawing an order issued pursuant to subsection (c)(1)(A)(i) may, by petition filed on or before the 30th day after the date upon which such holder receives notice of such withdrawal, obtain review thereof in accordance with section 387l of this title.
<br>(3) Temporary suspension
<br>
<br>If, after providing an opportunity for an informal hearing, the Secretary determines there is reasonable probability that the continuation of distribution of a tobacco product under an order would cause serious, adverse health consequences or death, that is greater than ordinarily caused by tobacco products on the market, the Secretary shall by order temporarily suspend the authority of the manufacturer to market the product. If the Secretary issues such an order, the Secretary shall proceed expeditiously under paragraph (1) to withdraw such application.
<br>(e) Service of order
<br>
<br>An order issued by the Secretary under this section shall be served—
<br>
<br>(1) in person by any officer or employee of the department designated by the Secretary; or
<br>
<br>(2) by mailing the order by registered mail or certified mail addressed to the applicant at the applicant's last known address in the records of the Secretary.

<br>(1) Additional information
<br>
<br>In the case of any tobacco product for which an order issued pursuant to subsection (c)(1)(A)(i) for an application filed under subsection (b) is in effect, the applicant shall establish and maintain such records, and make such reports to the Secretary, as the Secretary may by regulation, or by order with respect to such application, prescribe on the basis of a finding that such records and reports are necessary in order to enable the Secretary to determine, or facilitate a determination of, whether there is or may be grounds for withdrawing or temporarily suspending such order.
<br>(2) Access to records
<br>
<br>Each person required under this section to maintain records, and each person in charge of custody thereof, shall, upon request of an officer or employee designated by the Secretary, permit such officer or employee at all reasonable times to have access to and copy and verify such records.
<br>(g) Investigational tobacco product exemption for investigational use
<br>
<br>The Secretary may exempt tobacco products intended for investigational use from the provisions of this subchapter under such conditions as the Secretary may by regulation prescribe.

<br>(2) the conditions for using the product;
<br>
<br>(3) the formulation of the product;
<br>
<br>(4) sample product labels and labeling;
<br>
<br>(5) all documents (including underlying scientific information) relating to research findings conducted, supported, or possessed by the tobacco product manufacturer relating to the effect of the product on tobacco-related diseases and health-related conditions, including information both favorable and unfavorable to the ability of the product to reduce risk or exposure and relating to human health;
<br>
<br>(6) data and information on how consumers actually use the tobacco product; and
<br>
<br>(7) such other information as the Secretary may require.
<br>(e) Public availability
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall make the application described in subsection (d) publicly available (except matters in the application which are trade secrets or otherwise confidential, commercial information) and shall request comments by interested persons on the information contained in the application and on the label, labeling, and advertising accompanying such application.
<br>(f) Advisory Committee
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall refer to the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee any application submitted under this section.
<br>(2) Recommendations
<br>
<br>Not later than 60 days after the date an application is referred to the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee under paragraph (1), the Advisory Committee shall report its recommendations on the application to the Secretary.
<br>(g) Marketing
<br>(1) Modified risk products
<br>
<br>Except as provided in paragraph (2), the Secretary shall, with respect to an application submitted under this section, issue an order that a modified risk product may be commercially marketed only if the Secretary determines that the applicant has demonstrated that such product, as it is actually used by consumers, will—
<br>
<br>(A) significantly reduce harm and the risk of tobacco-related disease to individual tobacco users; and
<br>
<br>(B) benefit the health of the population as a whole taking into account both users of tobacco products and persons who do not currently use tobacco products.
<br>(2) Special rule for certain products
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary may issue an order that a tobacco product may be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce, pursuant to an application under this section, with respect to a tobacco product that may not be commercially marketed under paragraph (1) if the Secretary makes the findings required under this paragraph and determines that the applicant has demonstrated that—
<br>
<br>(i) such order would be appropriate to promote the public health;
<br>
<br>(ii) any aspect of the label, labeling, and advertising for such product that would cause the tobacco product to be a modified risk tobacco product under subsection (b) is limited to an explicit or implicit representation that such tobacco product or its smoke does not contain or is free of a substance or contains a reduced level of a substance, or presents a reduced exposure to a substance in tobacco smoke;
<br>
<br>(iii) scientific evidence is not available and, using the best available scientific methods, cannot be made available without conducting long-term epidemiological studies for an application to meet the standards set forth in paragraph (1); and
<br>
<br>(iv) the scientific evidence that is available without conducting long-term epidemiological studies demonstrates that a measurable and substantial reduction in morbidity or mortality among individual tobacco users is reasonably likely in subsequent studies.
<br>(B) Additional findings required
<br>
<br>To issue an order under subparagraph (A) the Secretary must also find that the applicant has demonstrated that—
<br>
<br>(i) the magnitude of the overall reductions in exposure to the substance or substances which are the subject of the application is substantial, such substance or substances are harmful, and the product as actually used exposes consumers to the specified reduced level of the substance or substances;
<br>
<br>(ii) the product as actually used by consumers will not expose them to higher levels of other harmful substances compared to the similar types of tobacco products then on the market unless such increases are minimal and the reasonably likely overall impact of use of the product remains a substantial and measurable reduction in overall morbidity and mortality among individual tobacco users;
<br>
<br>(iii) testing of actual consumer perception shows that, as the applicant proposes to label and market the product, consumers will not be misled into believing that the product—
<br>
<br>(I) is or has been demonstrated to be less harmful; or
<br>
<br>(II) presents or has been demonstrated to present less of a risk of disease than 1 or more other commercially marketed tobacco products; and
<br>
<br>(iv) issuance of an order with respect to the application is expected to benefit the health of the population as a whole taking into account both users of tobacco products and persons who do not currently use tobacco products.
<br>(C) Conditions of marketing
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>Applications subject to an order under this paragraph shall be limited to a term of not more than 5 years, but may be renewed upon a finding by the Secretary that the requirements of this paragraph continue to be satisfied based on the filing of a new application.
<br>(ii) Agreements by applicant
<br>
<br>An order under this paragraph shall be conditioned on the applicant's agreement to conduct postmarket surveillance and studies and to submit to the Secretary the results of such surveillance and studies to determine the impact of the order on consumer perception, behavior, and health and to enable the Secretary to review the accuracy of the determinations upon which the order was based in accordance with a protocol approved by the Secretary.
<br>(iii) Annual submission
<br>
<br>The results of such postmarket surveillance and studies described in clause (ii) shall be submitted annually.
<br>(3) Basis
<br>
<br>The determinations under paragraphs (1) and (2) shall be based on—
<br>
<br>(A) the scientific evidence submitted by the applicant; and
<br>
<br>(B) scientific evidence and other information that is made available to the Secretary.
<br>(4) Benefit to health of individuals and of population as a whole
<br>
<br>In making the determinations under paragraphs (1) and (2), the Secretary shall take into account—
<br>
<br>(A) the relative health risks to individuals of the tobacco product that is the subject of the application;
<br>
<br>(B) the increased or decreased likelihood that existing users of tobacco products who would otherwise stop using such products will switch to the tobacco product that is the subject of the application;
<br>
<br>(C) the increased or decreased likelihood that persons who do not use tobacco products will start using the tobacco product that is the subject of the application;
<br>
<br>(D) the risks and benefits to persons from the use of the tobacco product that is the subject of the application as compared to the use of products for smoking cessation approved under subchapter V to treat nicotine dependence; and
<br>
<br>(E) comments, data, and information submitted by interested persons.
<br>(h) Additional conditions for marketing
<br>(1) Modified risk products
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall require for the marketing of a product under this section that any advertising or labeling concerning modified risk products enable the public to comprehend the information concerning modified risk and to understand the relative significance of such information in the context of total health and in relation to all of the diseases and health-related conditions associated with the use of tobacco products.
<br>(2) Comparative claims
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary may require for the marketing of a product under this subsection that a claim comparing a tobacco product to 1 or more other commercially marketed tobacco products shall compare the tobacco product to a commercially marketed tobacco product that is representative of that type of tobacco product on the market (for example the average value of the top 3 brands of an established regular tobacco product).
<br>(B) Quantitative comparisons
<br>
<br>The Secretary may also require, for purposes of subparagraph (A), that the percent (or fraction) of change and identity of the reference tobacco product and a quantitative comparison of the amount of the substance claimed to be reduced shall be stated in immediate proximity to the most prominent claim.
<br>(3) Label disclosure
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary may require the disclosure on the label of other substances in the tobacco product, or substances that may be produced by the consumption of that tobacco product, that may affect a disease or health-related condition or may increase the risk of other diseases or health-related conditions associated with the use of tobacco products.
<br>(B) Conditions of use
<br>
<br>If the conditions of use of the tobacco product may affect the risk of the product to human health, the Secretary may require the labeling of conditions of use.
<br>(4) Time
<br>
<br>An order issued under subsection (g)(1) shall be effective for a specified period of time.
<br>(5) Advertising
<br>
<br>The Secretary may require, with respect to a product for which an applicant obtained an order under subsection (g)(1), that the product comply with requirements relating to advertising and promotion of the tobacco product.
<br>(i) Postmarket surveillance and studies
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall require, with respect to a product for which an applicant obtained an order under subsection (g)(1), that the applicant conduct postmarket surveillance and studies for such a tobacco product to determine the impact of the order issuance on consumer perception, behavior, and health, to enable the Secretary to review the accuracy of the determinations upon which the order was based, and to provide information that the Secretary determines is otherwise necessary regarding the use or health risks involving the tobacco product. The results of postmarket surveillance and studies shall be submitted to the Secretary on an annual basis.
<br>(2) Surveillance protocol
<br>
<br>Each applicant required to conduct a surveillance of a tobacco product under paragraph (1) shall, within 30 days after receiving notice that the applicant is required to conduct such surveillance, submit, for the approval of the Secretary, a protocol for the required surveillance. The Secretary, within 60 days of the receipt of such protocol, shall determine if the principal investigator proposed to be used in the surveillance has sufficient qualifications and experience to conduct such surveillance and if such protocol will result in collection of the data or other information designated by the Secretary as necessary to protect the public health.
<br>(j) Withdrawal of authorization
<br>
<br>The Secretary, after an opportunity for an informal hearing, shall withdraw an order under subsection (g) if the Secretary determines that—
<br>
<br>(1) the applicant, based on new information, can no longer make the demonstrations required under subsection (g), or the Secretary can no longer make the determinations required under subsection (g);
<br>
<br>(2) the application failed to include material information or included any untrue statement of material fact;
<br>
<br>(3) any explicit or implicit representation that the product reduces risk or exposure is no longer valid, including if—
<br>
<br>(A) a tobacco product standard is established pursuant to section 387g of this title;
<br>
<br>(B) an action is taken that affects the risks presented by other commercially marketed tobacco products that were compared to the product that is the subject of the application; or
<br>
<br>(C) any postmarket surveillance or studies reveal that the order is no longer consistent with the protection of the public health;
<br>
<br>(4) the applicant failed to conduct or submit the postmarket surveillance and studies required under subsection (g)(2)(C)(ii) or subsection (i); or
<br>
<br>(5) the applicant failed to meet a condition imposed under subsection (h).
<br>(k) Subchapter IV or V
<br>
<br>A product for which the Secretary has issued an order pursuant to subsection (g) shall not be subject to subchapter IV or V.
<br>(l) Implementing regulations or guidance
<br>(1) Scientific evidence
<br>
<br>Not later than 2 years after June 22, 2009, the Secretary shall issue regulations or guidance (or any combination thereof) on the scientific evidence required for assessment and ongoing review of modified risk tobacco products. Such regulations or guidance shall—
<br>
<br>(A) to the extent that adequate scientific evidence exists, establish minimum standards for scientific studies needed prior to issuing an order under subsection (g) to show that a substantial reduction in morbidity or mortality among individual tobacco users occurs for products described in subsection (g)(1) or is reasonably likely for products described in subsection (g)(2);
<br>
<br>(B) include validated biomarkers, intermediate clinical endpoints, and other feasible outcome measures, as appropriate;
<br>
<br>(C) establish minimum standards for postmarket studies, that shall include regular and long-term assessments of health outcomes and mortality, intermediate clinical endpoints, consumer perception of harm reduction, and the impact on quitting behavior and new use of tobacco products, as appropriate;
<br>
<br>(D) establish minimum standards for required postmarket surveillance, including ongoing assessments of consumer perception;
<br>
<br>(E) require that data from the required studies and surveillance be made available to the Secretary prior to the decision on renewal of a modified risk tobacco product; and
<br>
<br>(F) establish a reasonable timetable for the Secretary to review an application under this section.
<br>(2) Consultation
<br>
<br>The regulations or guidance issued under paragraph (1) shall be developed in consultation with the Institute of Medicine, and with the input of other appropriate scientific and medical experts, on the design and conduct of such studies and surveillance.

<br>The regulations or guidance under paragraph (1) shall be revised on a regular basis as new scientific information becomes available.
<br>(4) New tobacco products
<br>
<br>Not later than 2 years after June 22, 2009, the Secretary shall issue a regulation or guidance that permits the filing of a single application for any tobacco product that is a new tobacco product under section 387j of this title and which the applicant seeks to commercially market under this section.
<br>(m) Distributors
<br>
<br>Except as provided in this section, no distributor may take any action, after June 22, 2009, with respect to a tobacco product that would reasonably be expected to result in consumers believing that the tobacco product or its smoke may present a lower risk of disease or is less harmful than one or more commercially marketed tobacco products, or presents a reduced exposure to, or does not contain or is free of, a substance or substances.

<br>§387o. Regulation requirement
<br>(a) Testing, reporting, and disclosure
<br>
<br>Not later than 36 months after June 22, 2009, the Secretary shall promulgate regulations under this chapter that meet the requirements of subsection (b).
<br>(b) Contents of rules
<br>
<br>The regulations promulgated under subsection (a)—
<br>
<br>(1) shall require testing and reporting of tobacco product constituents, ingredients, and additives, including smoke constituents, by brand and subbrand that the Secretary determines should be tested to protect the public health, provided that, for purposes of the testing requirements of this paragraph, tobacco products manufactured and sold by a single tobacco product manufacturer that are identical in all respects except the labels, packaging design, logo, trade dress, trademark, brand name, or any combination thereof, shall be considered as a single brand; and
<br>
<br>(2) may require that tobacco product manufacturers, packagers, or importers make disclosures relating to the results of the testing of tar and nicotine through labels or advertising or other appropriate means, and make disclosures regarding the results of the testing of other constituents, including smoke constituents, ingredients, or additives, that the Secretary determines should be disclosed to the public to protect the public health and will not mislead consumers about the risk of tobacco-related disease.
<br>(c) Authority
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall have the authority under this subchapter to conduct or to require the testing, reporting, or disclosure of tobacco product constituents, including smoke constituents.
<br>(d) Small tobacco product manufacturers
<br>(1) First compliance date
<br>
<br>The initial regulations promulgated under subsection (a) shall not impose requirements on small tobacco product manufacturers before the later of—
<br>
<br>(A) the end of the 2-year period following the final promulgation of such regulations; and
<br>
<br>(B) the initial date set by the Secretary for compliance with such regulations by manufacturers that are not small tobacco product manufacturers.
<br>(2) Testing and reporting initial compliance period
<br>(A) 4-year period
<br>
<br>The initial regulations promulgated under subsection (a) shall give each small tobacco product manufacturer a 4-year period over which to conduct testing and reporting for all of its tobacco products. Subject to paragraph (1), the end of the first year of such 4-year period shall coincide with the initial date of compliance under this section set by the Secretary with respect to manufacturers that are not small tobacco product manufacturers or the end of the 2-year period following the final promulgation of such regulations, as described in paragraph (1)(A). A small tobacco product manufacturer shall be required—
<br>
<br>(i) to conduct such testing and reporting for 25 percent of its tobacco products during each year of such 4-year period; and
<br>
<br>(ii) to conduct such testing and reporting for its largest-selling tobacco products (as determined by the Secretary) before its other tobacco products, or in such other order of priority as determined by the Secretary.
<br>(B) Case-by-case delay
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the Secretary may, on a case-by-case basis, delay the date by which an individual small tobacco product manufacturer must conduct testing and reporting for its tobacco products under this section based upon a showing of undue hardship to such manufacturer. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Secretary shall not extend the deadline for a small tobacco product manufacturer to conduct testing and reporting for all of its tobacco products beyond a total of 5 years after the initial date of compliance under this section set by the Secretary with respect to manufacturers that are not small tobacco product manufacturers.
<br>(3) Subsequent and additional testing and reporting
<br>
<br>The regulations promulgated under subsection (a) shall provide that, with respect to any subsequent or additional testing and reporting of tobacco products required under this section, such testing and reporting by a small tobacco product manufacturer shall be conducted in accordance with the timeframes described in paragraph (2)(A), except that, in the case of a new product, or if there has been a modification described in section 387j(a)(1)(B) of this title of any product of a small tobacco product manufacturer since the last testing and reporting required under this section, the Secretary shall require that any subsequent or additional testing and reporting be conducted in accordance with the same timeframe applicable to manufacturers that are not small tobacco product manufacturers.
<br>(4) Joint laboratory testing services
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall allow any 2 or more small tobacco product manufacturers to join together to purchase laboratory testing services required by this section on a group basis in order to ensure that such manufacturers receive access to, and fair pricing of, such testing services.
<br>(e) Extensions for limited laboratory capacity
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The regulations promulgated under subsection (a) shall provide that a small tobacco product manufacturer shall not be considered to be in violation of this section before the deadline applicable under paragraphs (3) and (4), if—
<br>
<br>(A) the tobacco products of such manufacturer are in compliance with all other requirements of this subchapter; and
<br>
<br>(B) the conditions described in paragraph (2) are met.
<br>(2) Conditions
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding the requirements of this section, the Secretary may delay the date by which a small tobacco product manufacturer must be in compliance with the testing and reporting required by this section until such time as the testing is reported if, not later than 90 days before the deadline for reporting in accordance with this section, a small tobacco product manufacturer provides evidence to the Secretary demonstrating that—
<br>
<br>(A) the manufacturer has submitted the required products for testing to a laboratory and has done so sufficiently in advance of the deadline to create a reasonable expectation of completion by the deadline;
<br>
<br>(B) the products currently are awaiting testing by the laboratory; and
<br>
<br>(C) neither that laboratory nor any other laboratory is able to complete testing by the deadline at customary, nonexpedited testing fees.
<br>(3) Extension
<br>
<br>The Secretary, taking into account the laboratory testing capacity that is available to tobacco product manufacturers, shall review and verify the evidence submitted by a small tobacco product manufacturer in accordance with paragraph (2). If the Secretary finds that the conditions described in such paragraph are met, the Secretary shall notify the small tobacco product manufacturer that the manufacturer shall not be considered to be in violation of the testing and reporting requirements of this section until the testing is reported or until 1 year after the reporting deadline has passed, whichever occurs sooner. If, however, the Secretary has not made a finding before the reporting deadline, the manufacturer shall not be considered to be in violation of such requirements until the Secretary finds that the conditions described in paragraph (2) have not been met, or until 1 year after the reporting deadline, whichever occurs sooner.
<br>(4) Additional extension
<br>
<br>In addition to the time that may be provided under paragraph (3), the Secretary may provide further extensions of time, in increments of no more than 1 year, for required testing and reporting to occur if the Secretary determines, based on evidence properly and timely submitted by a small tobacco product manufacturer in accordance with paragraph (2), that a lack of available laboratory capacity prevents the manufacturer from completing the required testing during the period described in paragraph (3).
<br>(f) Rule of construction
<br>
<br>Nothing in subsection (d) or (e) shall be construed to authorize the extension of any deadline, or to otherwise affect any timeframe, under any provision of this chapter or the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act other than this section.
