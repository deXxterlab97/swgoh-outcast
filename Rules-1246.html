<br>§7842. Eligibility for refugee or asylum consideration
<br>(a) Purpose
<br>
<br>The purpose of this section is to clarify that North Koreans are not barred from eligibility for refugee status or asylum in the United States on account of any legal right to citizenship they may enjoy under the Constitution of the Republic of Korea. It is not intended in any way to prejudice whatever rights to citizenship North Koreans may enjoy under the Constitution of the Republic of Korea, or to apply to former North Korean nationals who have availed themselves of those rights.
<br>(b) Treatment of nationals of North Korea
<br>
<br>For purposes of eligibility for refugee status under section 1157 of title 8, or for asylum under section 1158 of title 8, a national of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea shall not be considered a national of the Republic of Korea.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 108–333, title III, §302, Oct. 18, 2004, 118 Stat. 1295.)
<br>§7843. Facilitating submission of applications for admission as a refugee
<br>
<br>The Secretary of State shall undertake to facilitate the submission of applications under section 1157 of title 8 by citizens of North Korea seeking protection as refugees (as defined in section 1101(a)(42) of title 8).
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 108–333, title III, §303, Oct. 18, 2004, 118 Stat. 1296.)
<br>§7844. United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
<br>(a) Actions in China
<br>
<br>It is the sense of Congress that—
<br>
<br>(1) the Government of China has obligated itself to provide the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) with unimpeded access to North Koreans inside its borders to enable the UNHCR to determine whether they are refugees and whether they require assistance, pursuant to the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, and Article III, paragraph 5 of the 1995 Agreement on the Upgrading of the UNHCR Mission in the People's Republic of China to UNHCR Branch Office in the People's Republic of China (referred to in this section as the "UNHCR Mission Agreement");
<br>
<br>(2) the United States, other UNHCR donor governments, and UNHCR should persistently and at the highest levels continue to urge the Government of China to abide by its previous commitments to allow UNHCR unimpeded access to North Korean refugees inside China;
<br>
<br>(3) the UNHCR, in order to effectively carry out its mandate to protect refugees, should liberally employ as professionals or Experts on Mission persons with significant experience in humanitarian assistance work among displaced North Koreans in China;
<br>
<br>(4) the UNHCR, in order to effectively carry out its mandate to protect refugees, should liberally contract with appropriate nongovernmental organizations that have a proven record of providing humanitarian assistance to displaced North Koreans in China;
<br>
<br>(5) the UNHCR should pursue a multilateral agreement to adopt an effective "first asylum" policy that guarantees safe haven and assistance to North Korean refugees; and
<br>
<br>(6) should the Government of China begin actively fulfilling its obligations toward North Korean refugees, all countries, including the United States, and relevant international organizations should increase levels of humanitarian assistance provided inside China to help defray costs associated with the North Korean refugee presence.
<br>(b) Arbitration proceedings
<br>
<br>It is further the sense of Congress that—
<br>
<br>(1) if the Government of China continues to refuse to provide the UNHCR with access to North Koreans within its borders, the UNHCR should initiate arbitration proceedings pursuant to Article XVI of the UNHCR Mission Agreement and appoint an arbitrator for the UNHCR; and
<br>
<br>(2) because access to refugees is essential to the UNHCR mandate and to the purpose of a UNHCR branch office, a failure to assert those arbitration rights in present circumstances would constitute a significant abdication by the UNHCR of one of its core responsibilities.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 108–333, title III, §304, Oct. 18, 2004, 118 Stat. 1296.)
<br>§7845. Annual reports
<br>(a) Immigration and refugee information
<br>
<br>Not later than 1 year after October 18, 2004, and every 12 months thereafter through 2022, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit a joint report to the appropriate congressional committees and the Committees on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and the Senate on the operation of this subchapter during the previous year, which shall include the following:
<br>
<br>(1) The number of aliens who are nationals or citizens of North Korea who applied for political asylum and the number who were granted political asylum.
<br>
<br>(2) The number of aliens who are nationals or citizens of North Korea who applied for refugee status and the number who were granted refugee status.
<br>
<br>(3) A detailed description of the measures undertaken by the Secretary of State to carry out section 7843 of this title, including country-specific information with respect to United States efforts to secure the cooperation and permission of the governments of countries in East and Southeast Asia to facilitate United States processing of North Koreans seeking protection as refugees. The information required under this paragraph shall be provided in unclassified form, with a classified annex, if necessary.
<br>(b) Countries of particular concern
<br>
<br>The President shall include in each annual report on proposed refugee admission pursuant to section 1157(d) of title 8, information about specific measures taken to facilitate access to the United States refugee program for individuals who have fled countries of particular concern for violations of religious freedom, identified pursuant to section 6442(b) of this title. The report shall include, for each country of particular concern, a description of access of the nationals or former habitual residents of that country to a refugee determination on the basis of—
<br>
<br>(1) referrals by external agencies to a refugee adjudication;
<br>
<br>(2) groups deemed to be of special humanitarian concern to the United States for purposes of refugee resettlement; and
<br>
<br>(3) family links to the United States.

<br>(B) Public sector activities
<br>
<br>The term "public sector activities" may include sovereign loans assumed by the recipient country to contribute to the financing of the investment plan.
<br>(C) Clean energy technology
<br>
<br>The term "clean energy technology" means a technology that, as compared with technologies being deployed at that time for widespread commercial use in the country involved—
<br>
<br>(i) achieves substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions;
<br>
<br>(ii) does not result in significant incremental adverse effects on public health or the environment; and
<br>
<br>(iii) does one or more of the following:
<br>
<br>(I) generates electricity or useful thermal energy from a renewable resource;
<br>
<br>(II) substantially increases the energy efficiency of buildings, industrial, or agricultural processes, or of electricity transmission, distribution, or end-use consumption; or

<br>§8001. Sense of Congress
<br>
<br>It is the sense of Congress that—
<br>
<br>(1) preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons, other weapons of mass destruction, the means to produce them, and the means to deliver them are critical objectives for United States foreign policy;
<br>
<br>(2) sustaining the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and strengthening its implementation, particularly its verification and compliance, is the keystone of United States nonproliferation policy;
<br>
<br>(3) the NPT has been a significant success in preventing the acquisition of nuclear weapons capabilities and maintaining a stable international security situation;
<br>
<br>(4) countries that have never become a party to the NPT and remain outside that treaty's legal regime pose a potential challenge to the achievement of the overall goals of global nonproliferation, because those countries have not undertaken the NPT obligation to prohibit the spread of nuclear weapons capabilities;
<br>
<br>(5) it is in the interest of the United States to the fullest extent possible to ensure that those countries that are not States Party to the NPT are responsible in the disposition of any nuclear technology they develop;
<br>
<br>(6) it is in the interest of the United States to enter into an agreement for nuclear cooperation arranged pursuant to section 2153 of title 42 with a country that has never been a State Party to the NPT if—
<br>
<br>(A) the country has demonstrated responsible behavior with respect to the nonproliferation of technology related to nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them;
<br>
<br>(B) the country has a functioning and uninterrupted democratic system of government, has a foreign policy that is congruent to that of the United States, and is working with the United States on key foreign policy initiatives related to nonproliferation;
<br>
<br>(C) such cooperation induces the country to promulgate and implement substantially improved protections against the proliferation of technology related to nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them, and to refrain from actions that would further the development of its nuclear weapons program; and
<br>
<br>(D) such cooperation will induce the country to give greater political and material support to the achievement of United States global and regional nonproliferation objectives, especially with respect to dissuading, isolating, and, if necessary, sanctioning and containing states that sponsor terrorism and terrorist groups that are seeking to acquire a nuclear weapons capability or other weapons of mass destruction capability and the means to deliver such weapons;
<br>
<br>(7) the United States should continue its policy of engagement, collaboration, and exchanges with and between India and Pakistan;
<br>
<br>(8) strong bilateral relations with India are in the national interest of the United States;
<br>
<br>(9) the United States and India share common democratic values and the potential for increasing and sustained economic engagement;
<br>
<br>(10) commerce in civil nuclear energy with India by the United States and other countries has the potential to benefit the people of all countries;
<br>
<br>(11) such commerce also represents a significant change in United States policy regarding commerce with countries that are not States Party to the NPT, which remains the foundation of the international nonproliferation regime;
<br>
<br>(12) any commerce in civil nuclear energy with India by the United States and other countries must be achieved in a manner that minimizes the risk of nuclear proliferation or regional arms races and maximizes India's adherence to international nonproliferation regimes, including, in particular, the guidelines of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG); and
<br>
<br>(13) the United States should not seek to facilitate or encourage the continuation of nuclear exports to India by any other party if such exports are terminated under United States law.

<br>§8002. Statements of policy
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>The following shall be the policies of the United States:
<br>
<br>(1) Oppose the development of a capability to produce nuclear weapons by any non-nuclear weapon state, within or outside of the NPT.
<br>
<br>(2) Encourage States Party to the NPT to interpret the right to "develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes", as set forth in Article IV of the NPT, as being a right that applies only to the extent that it is consistent with the object and purpose of the NPT to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons capabilities, including by refraining from all nuclear cooperation with any State Party that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) determines is not in full compliance with its NPT obligations, including its safeguards obligations.
<br>
<br>(3) Act in a manner fully consistent with the Guidelines for Nuclear Transfers and the Guidelines for Transfers of Nuclear-Related Dual-Use Equipment, Materials, Software and Related Technology developed by the NSG, and decisions related to the those 1 guidelines, and the rules and practices regarding NSG decisionmaking.
<br>
<br>(4) Strengthen the NSG guidelines and decisions concerning consultation by members regarding violations of supplier and recipient understandings by instituting the practice of a timely and coordinated response by NSG members to all such violations, including termination of nuclear transfers to an involved recipient, that discourages individual NSG members from continuing cooperation with such recipient until such time as a consensus regarding a coordinated response has been achieved.
<br>
<br>(5) Given the special sensitivity of equipment and technologies related to the enrichment of uranium, the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel, and the production of heavy water, work with members of the NSG, individually and collectively, to further restrict the transfers of such equipment and technologies, including to India.
<br>
<br>(6) Seek to prevent the transfer to a country of nuclear equipment, materials, or technology from other participating governments in the NSG or from any other source if nuclear transfers to that country are suspended or terminated pursuant to this chapter, the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.), or any other United States law.
<br>(b) With respect to South Asia
<br>
<br>The following shall be the policies of the United States with respect to South Asia:
<br>
<br>(1) Achieve, at the earliest possible date, a moratorium on the production of fissile material for nuclear explosive purposes by India, Pakistan, and the People's Republic of China.
<br>
<br>(2) Achieve, at the earliest possible date, the conclusion and implementation of a treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons to which both the United States and India become parties.
<br>
<br>(3) Secure India's—
<br>
<br>(A) full participation in the Proliferation Security Initiative;
<br>
<br>(B) formal commitment to the Statement of Interdiction Principles of such Initiative;
<br>
<br>(C) public announcement of its decision to conform its export control laws, regulations, and policies with the Australia Group and with the Guidelines, Procedures, Criteria, and Control Lists of the Wassenaar Arrangement;
<br>
<br>(D) demonstration of satisfactory progress toward implementing the decision described in subparagraph (C); and
<br>
<br>(E) ratification of or accession to the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage, done at Vienna on September 12, 1997.
<br>
<br>(4) Secure India's full and active participation in United States efforts to dissuade, isolate, and, if necessary, sanction and contain Iran for its efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction, including a nuclear weapons capability and the capability to enrich uranium or reprocess nuclear fuel, and the means to deliver weapons of mass destruction.
<br>
<br>(5) Seek to halt the increase of nuclear weapon arsenals in South Asia and to promote their reduction and eventual elimination.
<br>
<br>(6) Ensure that spent fuel generated in India's civilian nuclear power reactors is not transferred to the United States except pursuant to the Congressional review procedures required under section 131 f. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2160(f)).
<br>
<br>(7) Pending implementation of the multilateral moratorium described in paragraph (1) or the treaty described in paragraph (2), encourage India not to increase its production of fissile material at unsafeguarded nuclear facilities.
<br>
<br>(8) Ensure that any safeguards agreement or Additional Protocol to which India is a party with the IAEA can reliably safeguard any export or reexport to India of any nuclear materials and equipment.
<br>
<br>(9) Ensure that the text and implementation of any agreement for cooperation with India arranged pursuant to section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2153) meet the requirements set forth in subsections a.(1) and a.(3) through a.(9) of such section [42 U.S.C. 2153(a)(1), (3)–(9)].
<br>
<br>(10) Any nuclear power reactor fuel reserve provided to the Government of India for use in safeguarded civilian nuclear facilities should be commensurate with reasonable reactor operating requirements.
