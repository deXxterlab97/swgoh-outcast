<br>§17501. Definitions
<br>
<br>In this chapter, the following definitions apply:
<br>
<br>(1) Executive agency.—The term "executive agency"—
<br>
<br>(A) means an executive agency (as that term is defined in section 105 of title 5) that operates at least 300 motor vehicles; but
<br>
<br>(B) does not include the Tennessee Valley Authority.
<br>
<br>(2) Motor vehicle.—The term "motor vehicle" means—
<br>
<br>(A) a vehicle self-propelled or drawn by mechanical power; but not
<br>
<br>(B) a vehicle designed or used for military field training, combat, or tactical purposes, or any other special purpose vehicle exempted from the requirements of this chapter by the Administrator of General Services.

<br>
<br>In this section, the text of 40:913(2)–(4) is omitted as unnecessary because the complete names of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Administrator of General Services, and the Comptroller General of the United States are used the first time the terms appear in a section.
<br>
<br>Before clause (1), the words "this chapter" were in the original "this title", meaning title XV (§§15101 to 15313) of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (Public Law 99–272, 100 Stat. 330). In clause (2)(B), the words "this chapter" are substituted for "this part" as the probable intent of Congress because title XV of the Act does not contain part designations and the intention was probably to refer to title XV, which is restated as this chapter.
<br>§17502. Monitoring system
<br>
<br>The head of each executive agency shall designate one office, officer, or employee of the agency—
<br>
<br>(1) to establish and operate a central monitoring system for the motor vehicle operations of the agency, related activities, and related reporting requirements; and
<br>
<br>(2) provide oversight of those operations, activities, and requirements.

<br>In this chapter, the words "executive agency" are substituted for "executive agency, including the Department of Defense" to eliminate unnecessary words.
<br>§17503. Data collection
<br>
<br>(a) Cost Identification and Analysis.—The head of each executive agency shall develop a system to identify, collect, and analyze data with respect to all costs (including obligations and outlays) the agency incurs in the operation, maintenance, acquisition, and disposition of motor vehicles, including vehicles owned or leased by the Federal Government and privately owned vehicles used for official purposes.
<br>
<br>(b) Requirements for Data Systems.—
<br>
<br>(1) Scope of requirements.—In cooperation with the Comptroller General of the United States and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Administrator of General Services shall prescribe requirements governing the establishment and operation by executive agencies of the systems required by subsection (a), including requirements with respect to data on the costs and uses of motor vehicles and with respect to the uniform collection and submission of the data.
<br>
<br>(2) Conformity with principles and standards.—Requirements prescribed under this section shall conform to accounting principles and standards issued by the Comptroller General. Each executive agency shall comply with those requirements.

<br>
<br>(1) specifying—
<br>
<br>(A) the total motor vehicle acquisition, maintenance, leasing, operation, and disposal costs (including obligations and outlays) the agency incurred in the most recently completed fiscal year; and
<br>
<br>(B) an estimate of those costs for the fiscal year in which the request is submitted and for the succeeding fiscal year; and
<br>
<br>(2) justifying why the existing and any new motor vehicle acquisition, maintenance, leasing, operation, and disposal requirements of the agency cannot be met through the Interagency Fleet Management System the Administrator of General Services operates, a qualified private fleet management firm, or any other method which is less costly to the Federal Government.

<br>
<br>(1) the use of a qualified private fleet management firm or another private contractor;

<br>
<br>Pub. L. 114–65, Oct. 7, 2015, 129 Stat. 551, provided that:
<br>"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
<br>
<br>"This Act may be cited as the 'Federal Vehicle Repair Cost Savings Act of 2015'.
<br>"SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
<br>
<br>"Congress finds that, in March 2013, the Government Accountability Office issued a report that confirmed that—
<br>
<br>"(1) there are approximately 588,000 vehicles in the civilian Federal fleet;
<br>
<br>"(2) Federal agencies spent approximately $975,000,000 on repair and maintenance of the Federal fleet in 2011;
<br>
<br>"(3) remanufactured vehicle components, such as engines, starters, alternators, steering racks, and clutches, tend to be less expensive than comparable new replacement parts; and
<br>
<br>"(4) the United States Postal Service and the Department of the Interior both informed the Government Accountability Office that the respective agencies rely on the use of remanufactured vehicle components to reduce costs.
<br>"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
<br>
<br>"In this Act—
<br>
<br>"(1) the term 'Federal agency' has the meaning given that term in section 102 of title 40, United States Code; and
<br>
<br>"(2) the term 'remanufactured vehicle component' means a vehicle component (including an engine, transmission, alternator, starter, turbocharger, steering, or suspension component) that has been returned to same-as-new, or better, condition and performance by a standardized industrial process that incorporates technical specifications (including engineering, quality, and testing standards) to yield fully warranted products.
<br>"SEC. 4. REQUIREMENT TO USE REMANUFACTURED VEHICLE COMPONENTS.
<br>
<br>"The head of each Federal agency—
<br>
<br>"(1) shall encourage the use of remanufactured vehicle components to maintain Federal vehicles, if using such components reduces the cost of maintaining the Federal vehicles while maintaining quality; and
<br>
<br>"(2) shall not encourage the use of remanufactured vehicle components to maintain Federal vehicles, if using such components—
<br>
<br>"(A) does not reduce the cost of maintaining Federal vehicles;
<br>
<br>"(B) lowers the quality of vehicle performance, as determined by the employee of the Federal agency responsible for the repair decision; or
<br>
<br>"(C) delays the return to service of a vehicle."
<br>§17508. Compliance
<br>
<br>(a) Administrator of General Services.—The Administrator of General Services shall comply with and be subject to this chapter with regard to all motor vehicles that are used within the General Services Administration for official purposes.
<br>
<br>(b) Managers of Other Motor Pools.—This chapter with respect to motor vehicles from the Interagency Fleet Management System shall be complied with by the executive agencies to which such motor vehicles are assigned.

<br>§17509. Applicability
<br>
<br>(a) Priority in Reducing Headquarters Use.—The heads of executive agencies shall give first priority to meeting the goals established by the President under section 17507(a) of this title by reducing the costs of administrative motor vehicles used at the headquarters and regional headquarters of executive agencies, rather than by reducing the costs of motor vehicles used by line agency personnel working in agency field operations or activities.
<br>
<br>(b) Regulations, Standards, and Definitions.—The President shall require the Administrator of General Services, in cooperation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, to prescribe appropriate regulations, standards, and definitions to ensure that executive agencies meet the goals established under section 17507(a) of this title in the manner prescribed by subsection (a).

<br>
<br>In this chapter, the following definitions apply:
<br>
<br>(1) Federal agency.—The term "federal agency" means a department, agency, or instrumentality of the Federal Government.
<br>
<br>(2) Federally generated electric energy.—The term "federally generated electric energy" means any electric power generated by an electric generating facility owned and operated by a federal agency.
<br>
<br>(3) Non-federal person.—The term "non-federal person" means a corporation, cooperative, municipality, or other non-federal entity that generates electric energy through a facility other than a federally owned electric generating facility.

<br>
<br>In clause (1), the definition of "agency" as referring to the head of any department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States Government is rewritten as a definition of "federal agency" to avoid confusion between the role of the "agency" and the "head of the agency". Throughout the chapter, the words "head of the federal agency" are used when the source provision is referring to action taken by an official as opposed to the concept of the agency as an institution.
<br>
<br>In clause (3), the text of 40:795(1) and (4) is combined to eliminate a definition (40:795(1)) that is used only once.
<br>§17902. Sale of electric energy
<br>
<br>(a) In General.—To conserve oil and natural gas and better utilize coal, the head of a federal agency may sell, or enter into a contract to sell, to any non-federal person electric energy generated by coal-fired electric generating facilities of that agency in Alaska without regard to any provision of law that precludes the sale when the electric energy to be sold is available from other local sources, if the head of the federal agency determines that—
<br>
<br>(1) the electric energy to be sold is generated by an existing coal-fired generating facility;
<br>
<br>(2) the electric energy to be sold is surplus to the federal agency's needs and is in excess of the electric energy specifically generated for consumption by, or necessary to serve the requirements of, another federal agency;
<br>
<br>(3) the cost to the ultimate consumers of the electric energy to be sold is less than the cost that, in the absence of the sale, would be incurred by those consumers for the purchase of an equivalent amount of energy; and
<br>
<br>(4) the sale will reduce the total consumption of oil or natural gas by the non-federal person purchasing the electric energy below the level of consumption that would occur in the absence of the sale.
<br>
<br>(b) Pricing Policies.—Federally generated electric energy sold by the head of a federal agency under subsection (a) shall be priced to recover the fuel and variable operation and maintenance costs of the facility generating the energy that are attributable to that sale, plus an amount equal to one-half the difference between—
<br>
<br>(1) the costs of producing the electric energy by coal generation; and
<br>
<br>(2) the costs of producing electric energy by the oil or gas generation being displaced.

<br>In subsection (a), the words "to be sold" are added for clarity. In clause (4), the words "below the level of consumption that" are substituted for "below that consumption which" for clarity.
<br>
<br>In subsection (b), before clause (1), the words "fuel and variable operation and maintenance costs of the facility generating the energy that are attributable to that sale" are substituted for "fuel costs and variable operation and maintenance costs of the Federal generating facility concerned which costs are attributable to such sale" for clarity.
<br>§17903. Purchase of electric power
<br>
<br>For purposes of economy, efficiency, and conserving oil and natural gas, the head of a federal agency, when practicable and consistent with other laws and requirements applicable to that agency, shall endeavor to purchase electric energy from a non-federal person for consumption in Alaska by a facility of that agency when (taking into account the remaining useful life of any facility available to that agency to generate electric energy for that agency and the cost of maintaining the facility on a standby basis) the purchase will result in—
<br>
<br>(1) a savings to other consumers of electric energy sold by that non-federal person without increasing the cost incurred by any federal agency for electric energy; or
<br>
<br>(2) a cost savings to the federal agency purchasing the electric energy without increasing costs to other consumers of electric energy.

<br>§17904. Implementation powers and limitations
<br>
<br>(a) Accommodation of Needs for Electric Energy.—This chapter does not require or authorize a federal agency to construct a new electric generating facility or related facility, to modify an existing facility, or to employ reserve or standby equipment to accommodate the needs of a non-federal person for electric energy.
<br>
<br>(b) Availability of Revenue From Sales.—Revenue received by a federal agency pursuant to section 17902 of this title from the sale of electric energy generated from a facility of that agency is available to the agency without fiscal year limitation to purchase fuel and for operation, maintenance, and other costs associated with that facility.
<br>
<br>(c) Exercise of Authorities.—The authority under this chapter shall be exercised for those periods and pursuant to terms and conditions that the head of the federal agency concerned decides are necessary consistent with—
<br>
<br>(1) this chapter; and
<br>
<br>(2) responsibilities of the head of the federal agency under other law.
<br>
<br>(d) Negotiation and Execution of Contracts and Other Agreements.—A contract or other agreement executed under this chapter shall be negotiated and executed by the head of the federal agency selling or purchasing electric energy under this chapter.

<br>§18301. Findings and purposes
<br>
<br>(a) Findings.—Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) affordable public transportation is essential to the economic vitality of the national capital area and is an essential component of regional efforts to improve air quality to meet environmental requirements and to improve the health of both residents of and visitors to the national capital area as well as to preserve the beauty and dignity of the Nation's capital;
<br>
<br>(2) use of mass transit by both residents of and visitors to the national capital area is substantially affected by the prices charged for mass transit services, prices that are substantially affected by labor costs, since more than two-thirds of operating costs are attributable to labor costs;
<br>
<br>(3) labor costs incurred in providing mass transit in the national capital area have increased at an alarming rate and wages and benefits of operators and mechanics currently are among the highest in the Nation;
<br>
<br>(4) higher operating costs incurred for public transit in the national capital area cannot be offset by increasing costs to patrons, since this often discourages ridership and thus undermines the public interest in promoting the use of public transit;
<br>
<br>(5) spiraling labor costs cannot be offset by the governmental entities that are responsible for subsidy payments for public transit services since local governments generally, and the District of Columbia government in particular, are operating under severe fiscal constraints;
<br>
<br>(6) imposition of mandatory standards applicable to arbitrators resolving arbitration disputes involving interstate compact agencies operating in the national capital area will ensure that wage increases are justified and do not exceed the ability of transit patrons and taxpayers to fund the increase; and
<br>
<br>(7) federal legislation is necessary under section 8 of Article I of the United States Constitution to balance the need to moderate and lower labor costs while maintaining industrial peace.
<br>
<br>(b) Purpose.—The purpose of this chapter is to adopt standards governing arbitration that must be applied by arbitrators resolving disputes involving interstate compact agencies operating in the national capital area in order to lower operating costs for public transportation in the Washington metropolitan area.

<br>
<br>In subsection (a)(7), the reference is to section 8 of article I of the United States Constitution to correct an error in the source provision.
<br>§18302. Definitions
<br>
<br>In this chapter, the following definitions apply:
<br>
<br>(1) Arbitration.—The term "arbitration"—
<br>
<br>(A) means the arbitration of disputes, regarding the terms and conditions of employment, that is required under an interstate compact governing an interstate compact agency operating in the national capital area; but
<br>
<br>(B) does not include the interpretation and application of rights arising from an existing collective bargaining agreement.
<br>
<br>(2) Arbitrator.—The term "arbitrator" refers to either a single arbitrator, or a board of arbitrators, chosen under applicable procedures.
<br>
<br>(3) Interstate compact agency operating in the national capital area.—The term "interstate compact agency operating in the national capital area" means any interstate compact agency that provides public transit services and that was established by an interstate compact to which the District of Columbia is a signatory.

<br>
<br>The text of 40:1302(4) and (5) is combined to eliminate unnecessary words.
<br>§18303. Standards for arbitrators
<br>
<br>(a) Definition.—In this section, the term "public welfare" includes, with respect to arbitration under an interstate compact—
<br>
<br>(1) the financial ability of the individual jurisdictions participating in the compact to pay for the costs of providing public transit services; and
<br>
<br>(2) the average per capita tax burden, during the term of the collective bargaining agreement to which the arbitration relates, of the residents of the Washington metropolitan area, and the effect of an arbitration award rendered under that arbitration on the respective income or property tax rates of the jurisdictions that provide subsidy payments to the interstate compact agency established under the compact.
<br>
<br>(b) Factors in Making Arbitration Award.—An arbitrator rendering an arbitration award involving the employees of an interstate compact agency operating in the national capital area may not make a finding or a decision for inclusion in a collective bargaining agreement governing conditions of employment without considering the following factors:
<br>
<br>(1) The existing terms and conditions of employment of the employees in the bargaining unit.
<br>
<br>(2) All available financial resources of the interstate compact agency.
<br>
<br>(3) The annual increase or decrease in consumer prices for goods and services as reflected in the most recent consumer price index for the Washington metropolitan area, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
<br>
<br>(4) The wages, benefits, and terms and conditions of the employment of other employees who perform, in other jurisdictions in the Washington standard metropolitan statistical area, services similar to those in the bargaining unit.
<br>
<br>(5) The special nature of the work performed by the employees in the bargaining unit, including any hazards or the relative ease of employment, physical requirements, educational qualifications, job training and skills, shift assignments, and the demands placed upon the employees as compared to other employees of the interstate compact agency.
<br>
<br>(6) The interests and welfare of the employees in the bargaining unit, including—
<br>
<br>(A) the overall compensation presently received by the employees, having regard not only for wage rates but also for wages for time not worked, including vacations, holidays, and other excused absences;
<br>
<br>(B) all benefits received by the employees, including previous bonuses, insurance, and pensions; and
<br>
<br>(C) the continuity and stability of employment.
<br>
<br>(7) The public welfare.
<br>
<br>(c) Ability To Finance Salaries and Benefits Provided in Award.—An arbitrator rendering an arbitration award involving the employees of an interstate compact agency operating in the national capital area may not, with respect to a collective bargaining agreement governing conditions of employment, provide for salaries and other benefits that exceed the ability of the interstate compact agency, or of any governmental jurisdiction that provides subsidy payments or budgetary assistance to the interstate compact agency, to obtain the necessary financial resources to pay for wage and benefit increases for employees of the interstate compact agency.
<br>
<br>(d) Requirements for Final Award.—
<br>
<br>(1) Written award.—In resolving a dispute submitted to arbitration involving the employees of an interstate compact agency operating in the national capital area, the arbitrator shall issue a written award that demonstrates that all the factors set forth in subsections (b) and (c) have been considered and applied.
<br>
<br>(2) Prerequisites.—An award may grant an increase in pay rates or benefits (including insurance and pension benefits), or reduce hours of work, only if the arbitrator concludes that any costs to the agency do not adversely affect the public welfare.
<br>
<br>(3) Substantial evidence.—The arbitrator's conclusion regarding the public welfare must be supported by substantial evidence.

<br>§18304. Procedures for enforcement of awards
<br>
<br>(a) Modifications and Finality of Award.—Within 10 days after the parties receive an arbitration award to which section 18303 of this title applies, the interstate compact agency and the employees, through their representative, may agree in writing on any modifications to the award.

<br>
<br>(b) Implementation.—Each party to an award that becomes binding under subsection (a) shall take all actions necessary to implement the award.
<br>
<br>(c) Judicial Review.—Within 60 days after an award becomes binding under subsection (a), the interstate compact agency or the exclusive representative of the employees concerned may bring a civil action in a court that has jurisdiction over the interstate compact agency for review of the award. The court shall review the award on the record, and shall vacate the award or any part of the award, after notice and a hearing, if—
<br>
<br>(1) the award is in violation of applicable law;
<br>
<br>(2) the arbitrator exceeded the arbitrator's powers;
<br>
<br>(3) the decision by the arbitrator is arbitrary or capricious;
<br>
<br>(4) the arbitrator conducted the hearing contrary to the provisions of this chapter or other laws or rules that apply to the arbitration so as to substantially prejudice the rights of a party;
<br>
<br>(5) there was partiality or misconduct by the arbitrator prejudicing the rights of a party;
<br>
<br>(6) the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or bias on the part of the arbitrator; or
