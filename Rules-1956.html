<br>§3306. Planning and solicitation requirements
<br>
<br>(a) Planning and Specifications.—
<br>
<br>(1) Preparing for procurement.—In preparing for the procurement of property or services, an executive agency shall—
<br>
<br>(A) specify its needs and solicit bids or proposals in a manner designed to achieve full and open competition for the procurement;
<br>
<br>(B) use advance procurement planning and market research; and
<br>
<br>(C) develop specifications in the manner necessary to obtain full and open competition with due regard to the nature of the property or services to be acquired.
<br>
<br>(2) Requirements of specifications.—Each solicitation under this division shall include specifications that—
<br>
<br>(A) consistent with this division, permit full and open competition; and
<br>
<br>(B) include restrictive provisions or conditions only to the extent necessary to satisfy the needs of the executive agency or as authorized by law.
<br>
<br>(3) Types of specifications.—For the purposes of paragraphs (1) and (2), the type of specification included in a solicitation shall depend on the nature of the needs of the executive agency and the market available to satisfy those needs. Subject to those needs, specifications may be stated in terms of—
<br>
<br>(A) function, so that a variety of products or services may qualify;
<br>
<br>(B) performance, including specifications of the range of acceptable characteristics or of the minimum acceptable standards; or
<br>
<br>(C) design requirements.
<br>
<br>(b) Contents of Solicitation.—In addition to the specifications described in subsection (a), each solicitation for sealed bids or competitive proposals (other than for a procurement for commercial products or commercial services using special simplified procedures or a purchase for an amount not greater than the simplified acquisition threshold) shall at a minimum include—
<br>
<br>(1) a statement of—
<br>
<br>(A) all significant factors and significant subfactors that the executive agency reasonably expects to consider in evaluating sealed bids (including price) or competitive proposals (including cost or price, cost-related or price-related factors and subfactors, and noncost-related or nonprice-related factors and subfactors); and
<br>
<br>(B) the relative importance assigned to each of those factors and subfactors; and
<br>
<br>(2)(A) in the case of sealed bids—
<br>
<br>(i) a statement that sealed bids will be evaluated without discussions with the bidders; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the time and place for the opening of the sealed bids; or
<br>
<br>(B) in the case of competitive proposals—
<br>
<br>(i) either a statement that the proposals are intended to be evaluated with, and the award made after, discussions with the offerors, or a statement that the proposals are intended to be evaluated, and the award made, without discussions with the offerors (other than discussions conducted for the purpose of minor clarification) unless discussions are determined to be necessary; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the time and place for submission of proposals.
<br>
<br>(c) Evaluation Factors.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—In prescribing the evaluation factors to be included in each solicitation for competitive proposals, an executive agency shall—
<br>
<br>(A) establish clearly the relative importance assigned to the evaluation factors and subfactors, including the quality of the product or services to be provided (including technical capability, management capability, prior experience, and past performance of the offeror);
<br>
<br>(B) except as provided in paragraph (3), include cost or price to the Federal Government as an evaluation factor that must be considered in the evaluation of proposals; and
<br>
<br>(C) except as provided in paragraph (3), disclose to offerors whether all evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are—
<br>
<br>(i) significantly more important than cost or price;
<br>
<br>(ii) approximately equal in importance to cost or price; or
<br>
<br>(iii) significantly less important than cost or price.
<br>
<br>(2) Restriction on implementing regulations.—Regulations implementing paragraph (1)(C) may not define the terms "significantly more important" and "significantly less important" as specific numeric weights that would be applied uniformly to all solicitations or a class of solicitations.
<br>
<br>(3) Exceptions for certain indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity multiple-award contracts and certain federal supply schedule contracts for services acquired on an hourly rate.—If an executive agency issues a solicitation for one or more contracts for services to be acquired on an hourly rate basis under the authority of sections 4103 and 4106 of this title or section 152(3) of this title and section 501(b) of title 40 and the executive agency intends to make a contract award to each qualifying offeror and the contract or contracts will feature individually competed task or delivery orders based on hourly rates—
<br>
<br>(A) the contracting officer need not consider price as an evaluation factor for contract award; and
<br>
<br>(B) if, pursuant to subparagraph (A), price is not considered as an evaluation factor for contract award, cost or price to the Federal Government shall be considered in conjunction with the issuance pursuant to sections 4106(c) and 152(3) of this title of any task or delivery order under any contract resulting from the solicitation.
<br>
<br>(4) Definition.—In paragraph (3), the term "qualifying offeror" means an offeror that—
<br>
<br>(A) is determined to be a responsible source;
<br>
<br>(B) submits a proposal that conforms to the requirements of the solicitation;
<br>
<br>(C) meets all technical requirements; and
<br>
<br>(D) is otherwise eligible for award.
<br>
<br>(d) Additional Information in Solicitation.—This section does not prohibit an executive agency from—
<br>
<br>(1) providing additional information in a solicitation, including numeric weights for all evaluation factors and subfactors on a case-by-case basis; or
<br>
<br>(2) stating in a solicitation that award will be made to the offeror that meets the solicitation's mandatory requirements at the lowest cost or price.
<br>
<br>(e) Limitation on Evaluation of Purchase Options.—An executive agency, in issuing a solicitation for a contract to be awarded using sealed bid procedures, may not include in the solicitation a clause providing for the evaluation of prices for options to purchase additional property or services under the contract unless the executive agency has determined that there is a reasonable likelihood that the options will be exercised.
<br>
<br>(f) Authorization of Telecommuting for Federal Contractors.—
<br>
<br>(1) Definition.—In this subsection, the term "executive agency" has the meaning given that term in section 133 of this title.
<br>
<br>(2) Federal acquisition regulation to allow telecommuting.—The Federal Acquisition Regulation issued in accordance with sections 1121(b) and 1303(a)(1) of this title shall permit telecommuting by employees of Federal Government contractors in the performance of contracts entered into with executive agencies.
<br>
<br>(3) Scope of allowance.—The Federal Acquisition Regulation at a minimum shall provide that a solicitation for the acquisition of property or services may not set forth any requirement or evaluation criteria that would—
<br>
<br>(A) render an offeror ineligible to enter into a contract on the basis of the inclusion of a plan of the offeror to allow the offeror's employees to telecommute, unless the contracting officer concerned first determines that the requirements of the agency, including security requirements, cannot be met if telecommuting is allowed and documents in writing the basis for the determination; or
<br>
<br>(B) reduce the scoring of an offer on the basis of the inclusion in the offer of a plan of the offeror to allow the offeror's employees to telecommute, unless the contracting officer concerned first determines that the requirements of the agency, including security requirements, would be adversely impacted if telecommuting is allowed and documents in writing the basis for the determination.

<br>
<br>(2) Laws listed in federal acquisition regulation.—A contract for the procurement of a commercial product or commercial service entered into by the head of an executive agency is not subject to a law properly listed in the Federal Acquisition Regulation pursuant to section 1906 of this title.
<br>
<br>(b) Preference.—The head of each executive agency shall ensure that, to the maximum extent practicable—
<br>
<br>(1) requirements of the executive agency with respect to a procurement of supplies or services are stated in terms of—
<br>
<br>(A) functions to be performed;
<br>
<br>(B) performance required; or
<br>
<br>(C) essential physical characteristics;
<br>
<br>(2) those requirements are defined so that commercial services or commercial products or, to the extent that commercial products suitable to meet the executive agency's needs are not available, nondevelopmental items other than commercial products may be procured to fulfill those requirements; and
<br>
<br>(3) offerors of commercial services, commercial products, and nondevelopmental items other than commercial products are provided an opportunity to compete in any procurement to fill those requirements.
<br>
<br>(c) Implementation.—The head of each executive agency shall ensure that procurement officials in that executive agency, to the maximum extent practicable—
<br>
<br>(1) acquire commercial services or commercial products or nondevelopmental items other than commercial products to meet the needs of the executive agency;

<br>(4) state specifications in terms that enable and encourage bidders and offerors to supply commercial services or commercial products or, to the extent that commercial products suitable to meet the executive agency's needs are not available, nondevelopmental items other than commercial products in response to the executive agency solicitations;
<br>
<br>(5) revise the executive agency's procurement policies, practices, and procedures not required by law to reduce any impediments in those policies, practices, and procedures to the acquisition of commercial products and commercial services; and

<br>(6) require training of appropriate personnel in the acquisition of commercial products and commercial services.
<br>
<br>(d) Market Research.—
<br>

<br>
<br>(B) before soliciting bids or proposals for a contract in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold.
<br>
<br>(2) Use of results.—The head of an executive agency shall use the results of market research to determine whether commercial services or commercial products or, to the extent that commercial products suitable to meet the executive agency's needs are not available, nondevelopmental items other than commercial products are available that—
<br>
<br>(A) meet the executive agency's requirements;
<br>
<br>(B) could be modified to meet the executive agency's requirements; or
<br>
<br>(C) could meet the executive agency's requirements if those requirements were modified to a reasonable extent.
<br>

<br>

<br>§3308. Planning for future competition in contracts for major systems
<br>
<br>(a) Development Contract.—
<br>
<br>(1) Determining whether proposals are necessary.—In preparing a solicitation for the award of a development contract for a major system, the head of an agency shall consider requiring in the solicitation that an offeror include in its offer proposals described in paragraph (2). In determining whether to require the proposals, the head of the agency shall consider the purposes for which the system is being procured and the technology necessary to meet the system's required capabilities. If the proposals are required, the head of the agency shall consider them in evaluating the offeror's price.
<br>
<br>(2) Contents of proposals.—The proposals that the head of an agency is to consider requiring in a solicitation for the award of a development contract are the following:
<br>
<br>(A) Proposals to incorporate in the design of the major system items that are currently available within the supply system of the Federal agency responsible for the major system, available elsewhere in the national supply system, or commercially available from more than one source.
<br>
<br>(B) With respect to items that are likely to be required in substantial quantities during the system's service life, proposals to incorporate in the design of the major system items that the Federal Government will be able to acquire competitively in the future.
<br>
<br>(b) Production Contract.—
<br>
<br>(1) Determining whether proposals are necessary.—In preparing a solicitation for the award of a production contract for a major system, the head of an agency shall consider requiring in the solicitation that an offeror include in its offer proposals described in paragraph (2). In determining whether to require the proposals, the head of the agency shall consider the purposes for which the system is being procured and the technology necessary to meet the system's required capabilities. If the proposals are required, the head of the agency shall consider them in evaluating the offeror's price.
<br>
<br>(2) Content of proposals.—The proposals that the head of an agency is to consider requiring in a solicitation for the award of a production contract are proposals identifying opportunities to ensure that the Federal Government will be able to obtain on a competitive basis items procured in connection with the system that are likely to be reprocured in substantial quantities during the service life of the system. Proposals submitted in response to this requirement may include the following:
<br>
<br>(A) Proposals to provide to the Federal Government the right to use technical data to be provided under the contract for competitive reprocurement of the item, together with the cost to the Federal Government of acquiring the data and the right to use the data.
<br>
<br>(B) Proposals for the qualification or development of multiple sources of supply for the item.
<br>
<br>(c) Consideration of Factors as Objectives in Negotiations.—If the head of an agency is making a noncompetitive award of a development contract or a production contract for a major system, the factors specified in subsections (a) and (b) to be considered in evaluating an offer for a contract may be considered as objectives in negotiating the contract to be awarded.

<br>§3309. Design-build selection procedures
<br>
<br>(a) Authorization.—Unless the traditional acquisition approach of design-bid-build established under sections 1101 to 1104 of title 40 or another acquisition procedure authorized by law is used, the head of an executive agency shall use the two-phase selection procedures authorized in this section for entering into a contract for the design and construction of a public building, facility, or work when a determination is made under subsection (b) that the procedures are appropriate for use.
<br>
<br>(b) Criteria for Use.—A contracting officer shall make a determination whether two-phase selection procedures are appropriate for use for entering into a contract for the design and construction of a public building, facility, or work when—
<br>
<br>(1) the contracting officer anticipates that 3 or more offers will be received for the contract;
<br>
<br>(2) design work must be performed before an offeror can develop a price or cost proposal for the contract;
<br>
<br>(3) the offeror will incur a substantial amount of expense in preparing the offer; and
<br>
<br>(4) the contracting officer has considered information such as the following:
<br>
<br>(A) The extent to which the project requirements have been adequately defined.
<br>
<br>(B) The time constraints for delivery of the project.
<br>
<br>(C) The capability and experience of potential contractors.
<br>
<br>(D) The suitability of the project for use of the two-phase selection procedures.
<br>
<br>(E) The capability of the agency to manage the two-phase selection process.
<br>
<br>(F) Other criteria established by the agency.
<br>
<br>(c) Procedures Described.—Two-phase selection procedures consist of the following:
<br>
<br>(1) Development of scope of work statement.—The agency develops, either in-house or by contract, a scope of work statement for inclusion in the solicitation that defines the project and provides prospective offerors with sufficient information regarding the Federal Government's requirements (which may include criteria and preliminary design, budget parameters, and schedule or delivery requirements) to enable the offerors to submit proposals that meet the Federal Government's needs. If the agency contracts for development of the scope of work statement, the agency shall contract for architectural and engineering services as defined by and in accordance with sections 1101 to 1104 of title 40.
<br>
<br>(2) Solicitation of phase-one proposals.—The contracting officer solicits phase-one proposals that—
<br>
<br>(A) include information on the offeror's—
<br>
<br>(i) technical approach; and
<br>
<br>(ii) technical qualifications; and
<br>
<br>(B) do not include—
<br>
<br>(i) detailed design information; or
<br>
<br>(ii) cost or price information.
<br>
<br>(3) Evaluation factors.—The evaluation factors to be used in evaluating phase-one proposals are stated in the solicitation and include specialized experience and technical competence, capability to perform, past performance of the offeror's team (including the architect-engineer and construction members of the team), and other appropriate factors, except that cost-related or price-related evaluation factors are not permitted. Each solicitation establishes the relative importance assigned to the evaluation factors and subfactors that must be considered in the evaluation of phase-one proposals. The agency evaluates phase-one proposals on the basis of the phase-one evaluation factors set forth in the solicitation.
<br>
<br>(4) Selection by contracting officer.—
<br>
<br>(A) Number of offerors selected and what is to be evaluated.—The contracting officer selects as the most highly qualified the number of offerors specified in the solicitation to provide the property or services under the contract and requests the selected offerors to submit phase-two competitive proposals that include technical proposals and cost or price information. Each solicitation establishes with respect to phase two—
<br>
<br>(i) the technical submission for the proposal, including design concepts or proposed solutions to requirements addressed within the scope of work, or both; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the evaluation factors and subfactors, including cost or price, that must be considered in the evaluations of proposals in accordance with subsections (b) to (d) of section 3306 of this title.
<br>
<br>(B) Separate evaluations.—The contracting officer separately evaluates the submissions described in clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (A).
<br>
<br>(5) Awarding of contract.—The agency awards the contract in accordance with chapter 37 of this title.
<br>
<br>(d) Solicitation To State Number of Offerors To Be Selected for Phase-Two Requests for Competitive Proposals.—A solicitation issued pursuant to the procedures described in subsection (c) shall state the maximum number of offerors that are to be selected to submit competitive proposals pursuant to subsection (c)(4). The maximum number specified in the solicitation shall not exceed 5 unless the agency determines with respect to an individual solicitation that a specified number greater than 5 is in the Federal Government's interest and is consistent with the purposes and objectives of the two-phase selection process.
<br>
<br>(e) Requirement for Guidance and Regulations.—The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall include guidance—
<br>
<br>(1) regarding the factors that may be considered in determining whether the two-phase contracting procedures authorized by subsection (a) are appropriate for use in individual contracting situations;
<br>
<br>(2) regarding the factors that may be used in selecting contractors; and
<br>
<br>(3) providing for a uniform approach to be used Government-wide.

<br>(6) ensure that a potential offeror seeking qualification is promptly informed whether qualification is attained and, if not attained, is promptly furnished specific information about why qualification was not attained.
<br>
<br>(c) Applicability, Waiver Authority, and Referral of Offers.—
<br>
<br>(1) Applicability.—Subsection (b) does not apply to a qualification requirement established by statute prior to October 30, 1984.
<br>
<br>(2) Waiver authority.—
<br>
<br>(A) Submission of determination of unreasonableness.—Except as provided in subparagraph (C), if it is unreasonable to specify the standards for qualification that a prospective offeror or its product must satisfy, a determination to that effect shall be submitted to the advocate for competition of the procuring activity responsible for the purchase of the item subject to the qualification requirement.
<br>
<br>(B) Authority to grant waiver.—After considering any comments of the advocate for competition reviewing the determination, the head of the procuring activity may waive the requirements of paragraphs (2) to (5) of subsection (b) for up to 2 years with respect to the item subject to the qualification requirement.
<br>
<br>(C) Nonapplicability to qualified products list.—Waiver authority under this paragraph does not apply with respect to a qualified products list.
<br>
<br>(3) Submission and consideration of offer not to be denied.—A potential offeror may not be denied the opportunity to submit and have considered an offer for a contract solely because the potential offeror has not been identified as meeting a qualification requirement if the potential offeror can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the contracting officer that the potential offeror or its product meets the standards established for qualification or can meet those standards before the date specified for award of the contract.
<br>
<br>(4) Referral to small business administration not required.—This subsection does not require the referral of an offer to the Small Business Administration pursuant to section 8(b)(7) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(b)(7)) if the basis for the referral is a challenge by the offeror to either the validity of the qualification requirement or the offeror's compliance with that requirement.
<br>
<br>(5) Delay of procurement not required.—The head of an agency need not delay a proposed procurement to comply with subsection (b) or to provide a potential offeror with an opportunity to demonstrate its ability to meet the standards specified for qualification.
<br>
<br>(d) Fewer Than 2 Actual Manufacturers.—
<br>
<br>(1) Solicitation and testing of additional sources or products.—If the number of qualified sources or qualified products available to compete actively for an anticipated future requirement is fewer than 2 actual manufacturers or the products of 2 actual manufacturers, respectively, the head of the agency concerned shall—
<br>
<br>(A) publish notice periodically soliciting additional sources or products to seek qualification, unless the contracting officer determines that doing so would compromise national security; and
<br>
<br>(B) subject to paragraph (2), bear the cost of conducting the specified testing and evaluation (excluding the cost associated with producing the item or establishing the production, quality control, or other system to be tested and evaluated) for a small business concern or a product manufactured by a small business concern that has met the standards specified for qualification and that could reasonably be expected to compete for a contract for that requirement.
<br>
<br>(2) When agency may bear cost.—The head of the agency concerned may bear the cost under paragraph (1)(B) only if the head of the agency determines that the additional qualified sources or products are likely to result in cost savings from increased competition for future requirements sufficient to offset (within a reasonable period of time considering the duration and dollar value of anticipated future requirements) the cost incurred by the agency.
<br>
<br>(3) Certification required.—The head of the agency shall require a prospective contractor requesting the Federal Government to bear testing and evaluation costs under paragraph (1)(B) to certify its status as a small business concern under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632).
<br>
<br>(e) Examination and Revalidation of Qualification Requirement.—Within 7 years after the establishment of a qualification requirement, the need for the requirement shall be examined and the standards of the requirement revalidated in accordance with the requirements of subsection (b). This subsection does not apply in the case of a qualification requirement for which a waiver is in effect under subsection (c)(2).
<br>
<br>(f) When Enforcement of Qualification Requirement Not Allowed.—Except in an emergency as determined by the head of the agency, after the head of the agency determines not to enforce a qualification requirement for a solicitation, the agency may not enforce the requirement unless the agency complies with the requirements of subsection (b).

<br>§3501. General
<br>
<br>(a) Definitions.—In this chapter:
<br>
<br>(1) Cost or pricing data.—The term "cost or pricing data" means all facts that, as of the date of agreement on the price of a contract (or the price of a contract modification) or, if applicable consistent with section 3506(a)(2) of this title, another date agreed upon between the parties, a prudent buyer or seller would reasonably expect to affect price negotiations significantly. The term does not include information that is judgmental, but does include factual information from which a judgment was derived.
<br>
<br>(2) Subcontract.—The term "subcontract" includes a transfer of commercial products or commercial services between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of a contractor or a subcontractor.
<br>
<br>(b) Regulations.—
<br>
<br>(1) Minimizing abuse of commercial services authority.—The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall ensure that services that are not offered and sold competitively in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace, but are of a type offered and sold competitively in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace, may be treated as commercial services for purposes of this chapter only if the contracting officer determines in writing that the offeror has submitted sufficient information to evaluate, through price analysis, the reasonableness of the price for the services.
<br>
<br>(2) Information to submit.—To the extent necessary to make a determination under paragraph (1), the contracting officer may request the offeror to submit—
<br>
<br>(A) prices paid for the same or similar commercial services under comparable terms and conditions by both government and commercial customers; and
<br>
<br>(B) if the contracting officer determines that the information described in subparagraph (A) is not sufficient to determine the reasonableness of price, other relevant information regarding the basis for price or cost, including information on labor costs, material costs, and overhead rates.

<br>§3506. Price reductions for defective cost or pricing data
<br>
<br>(a) Provision Requiring Adjustment.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—A prime contract (or change or modification to a prime contract) under which a certificate under section 3502(b) of this title is required shall contain a provision that the price of the contract to the Federal Government, including profit or fee, shall be adjusted to exclude any significant amount by which it may be determined by the head of the executive agency that the price was increased because the contractor (or any subcontractor required to make the certificate available) submitted defective cost or pricing data.
<br>
<br>(2) What constitutes defective cost or pricing data.—For the purposes of this chapter, defective cost or pricing data are cost or pricing data that, as of the date of agreement on the price of the contract (or another date agreed on between the parties), were inaccurate, incomplete, or noncurrent. If for purposes of the preceding sentence the parties agree on a date other than the date of agreement on the price of the contract, the date agreed on by the parties shall be as close to the date of agreement on the price of the contract as is practicable.
<br>
<br>(b) Valid Defense.—In determining for purposes of a contract price adjustment under a contract provision required by subsection (a) whether, and to what extent, a contract price was increased because the contractor (or a subcontractor) submitted defective cost or pricing data, it is a defense that the Federal Government did not rely on the defective data submitted by the contractor or subcontractor.
<br>
<br>(c) Invalid Defenses.—It is not a defense to an adjustment of the price of a contract under a contract provision required by subsection (a) that—
<br>
<br>(1) the price of the contract would not have been modified even if accurate, complete, and current cost or pricing data had been submitted by the contractor or subcontractor because the contractor or subcontractor—
<br>
<br>(A) was the sole source of the property or services procured; or
<br>
<br>(B) otherwise was in a superior bargaining position with respect to the property or services procured;
<br>
<br>(2) the contracting officer should have known that the cost or pricing data in issue were defective even though the contractor or subcontractor took no affirmative action to bring the character of the data to the attention of the contracting officer;
<br>
<br>(3) the contract was based on an agreement between the contractor and the Federal Government about the total cost of the contract and there was no agreement about the cost of each item procured under the contract; or
<br>
<br>(4) the prime contractor or subcontractor did not submit a certification of cost or pricing data relating to the contract as required by section 3502(b) of this title.
<br>
<br>(d) Offsets.—
<br>
<br>(1) When allowed.—A contractor shall be allowed to offset an amount against the amount of a contract price adjustment under a contract provision required by subsection (a) if—
<br>
<br>(A) the contractor certifies to the contracting officer (or to a designated representative of the contracting officer) that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, the contractor is entitled to the offset; and
<br>
<br>(B) the contractor proves that the cost or pricing data were available before the date of agreement on the price of the contract (or price of the modification), or, if applicable, consistent with subsection (a)(2), another date agreed on by the parties, and that the data were not submitted as specified in section 3502(c) of this title before that date.
<br>
<br>(2) When not allowed.—A contractor shall not be allowed to offset an amount otherwise authorized to be offset under paragraph (1) if—
<br>
<br>(A) the certification under section 3502(b) of this title with respect to the cost or pricing data involved was known to be false when signed; or
<br>
<br>(B) the Federal Government proves that, had the cost or pricing data referred to in paragraph (1)(B) been submitted to the Federal Government before date of agreement on the price of the contract (or price of the modification), or, if applicable, under subsection (a)(2), another date agreed on by the parties, the submission of the cost or pricing data would not have resulted in an increase in that price in the amount to be offset.

<br>§3507. Interest and penalties for certain overpayments
<br>
<br>(a) In General.—If the Federal Government makes an overpayment to a contractor under a contract with an executive agency subject to this chapter and the overpayment was due to the submission by the contractor of defective cost or pricing data, the contractor shall be liable to the Federal Government—
<br>
<br>(1) for interest on the amount of the overpayment, to be computed—
<br>
<br>(A) for the period beginning on the date the overpayment was made to the contractor and ending on the date the contractor repays the amount of the overpayment to the Federal Government; and
<br>
<br>(B) at the current rate prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 6621 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 6621); and
<br>
<br>(2) if the submission of the defective data was a knowing submission, for an additional amount equal to the amount of the overpayment.
<br>
<br>(b) Liability Not Affected by Refusal To Submit Certification.—Any liability under this section of a contractor that submits cost or pricing data but refuses to submit the certification required by section 3502(b) of this title with respect to the cost or pricing data is not affected by the refusal to submit the certification.
