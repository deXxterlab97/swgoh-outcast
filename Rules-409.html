<br>
<br>Agreements entered into under this subsection between the Secretary and a qualified participating entity shall specify the percentage of loss that each of the parties to the agreement will assume in the event of default of the insured or reinsured multifamily mortgage.

Any financing permitted on property insured under this subsection other than the first mortgage shall be expressly subordinate to the insured mortgage.
<br>(F) Authority of Secretary
<br>
<br>The Secretary, upon request of a qualified participating entity, may insure or reinsure and make commitments to insure or reinsure under this section any mortgage, advance, loan, or pool of mortgages otherwise eligible under this section, pursuant to a risk-sharing agreement providing that the qualified participating entity will carry out (under a delegation or otherwise, and with or without compensation, but subject to audit, exception, or review requirements) such credit approval, appraisal, inspection, issuance of commitments, approval of insurance of advances, cost certification, servicing, property disposition, or other functions as the Secretary shall approve as consistent with the purpose of this section.

Such alternatives shall be designed—
<br>
<br>(A) to ensure that other parties bear a share of the risk, in percentage amount and in position of exposure, that is sufficient to create strong, market-oriented incentives for other participating parties to maintain sound underwriting and loan management practices;
<br>
<br>(B) to develop credit mechanisms, including sound underwriting criteria, processing methods, and credit enhancements, through which resources of the Federal Housing Administration can assist in increasing multifamily housing lending as needed to meet the expected need in the United States;
<br>
<br>(C) to provide a more adequate supply of mortgage credit for sound multifamily rental housing projects in underserved urban and rural markets;
<br>
<br>(D) to encourage major financial institutions to expand their participation in mortgage lending for sound multifamily housing, through means such as mitigating uncertainties regarding actions of the Federal Government (including the possible failure to renew short-term subsidy contracts);
<br>
<br>(E) to increase the efficiency, and lower the costs to the Federal Government, of processing and servicing multifamily housing mortgage loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration; and
<br>
<br>(F) to improve the quality and expertise of Federal Housing Administration staff and other resources, as required for sound management of reinsurance and other market-oriented forms of credit enhancement.

<br>(iv) Approval by States
<br>
<br>In cases in which a unit of general local government carries out the responsibilities described in clause (i), the Secretary may permit the State to perform those actions of the Secretary described in clause (ii) and the performance of such actions by the State, where permitted by the Secretary, shall be deemed to satisfy the Secretary's responsibilities referred to in the second sentence of clause (ii).

<br>(d) Insurance of mortgages
<br>
<br>The Secretary is authorized upon application of a mortgagee to make commitments to insure or to insure any eligible mortgage that has been refinanced in a manner meeting the requirements under subsection (e).

<br>(1) Borrower certification

<br>
<br>The mortgagor shall provide a certification to the Secretary that the mortgagor has not intentionally defaulted on the existing mortgage or mortgages or any other substantial debt within the last 5 years and has not knowingly, or willfully and with actual knowledge, furnished material information known to be false for the purpose of obtaining the eligible mortgage to be insured and has not been convicted under Federal or State law for fraud during the 10-year period ending upon the insurance of the mortgage under this section.

<br>(C) Current borrower debt-to-income ratio
<br>
<br>As of the date of application for a commitment to insure or insurance under this section, the mortgagor shall have had, or thereafter is likely to have, due to the terms of the mortgage being reset, a ratio of mortgage debt to income, taking into consideration all existing mortgages of that mortgagor at such time, greater than 31 percent (or such higher amount as the Secretary determines appropriate).
<br>(2) Determination of principal obligation amount
<br>
<br>The principal obligation amount of the refinanced eligible mortgage to be insured shall—
<br>
<br>(A) be determined by the reasonable ability of the mortgagor to make his or her mortgage payments, as such ability is determined by the Secretary pursuant to section 1709(b)(4) of this title or by any other underwriting standards established by the Secretary; and

The Secretary may take such actions as may be necessary and appropriate to facilitate coordination and agreement between the holders of the existing senior mortgage and any existing subordinate mortgages, taking into consideration the subordinate lien status of such subordinate mortgages.

<br>
<br>(E) comply with the requirements of subsection (g) of this section (relating to appraisal independence).
<br>(9) Documentation and verification of income
<br>
<br>In complying with the FHA underwriting requirements under the HOPE for Homeowners Program under this section, the mortgagee shall document and verify the income of the mortgagor or non-filing status in accordance with procedures and standards that the Secretary shall establish (provided that such procedures and standards are consistent with section 1709(b) of this title to the maximum extent possible) which may include requiring the mortgagee to procure a copy of the income tax returns from the Internal Revenue Service, for the two most recent years for which the filing deadline for such years has passed.
<br>(10) Mortgage fraud

<br>
<br>The Board shall conduct a study of the need for and efficacy of an auction or bulk refinancing mechanism to facilitate refinancing of existing residential mortgages that are at risk for foreclosure into mortgages insured under this section.
