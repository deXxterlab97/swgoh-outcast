<br>Ex Ord. No. 13911. Delegating Additional Authority Under the Defense Production Act With Respect to Health and Medical Resources To Respond to the Spread of COVID–19
<br>
<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13911, Mar. 27, 2020, 85 F.R. 18403, provided:
<br>
<br>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (50 U.S.C. 4501 et seq.) (the "Act"), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:
<br>
<br>Section 1. Policy. In Proclamation 9994 of March 13, 2020 (Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID–19) Outbreak) [50 U.S.C. 1621 note], I declared a national emergency recognizing the threat that the novel (new) coronavirus known as SARS–CoV–2 poses to our Nation's healthcare systems. In recognizing the public health risk, I noted that on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced that the outbreak of COVID–19 (the disease caused by SARS–CoV–2) can be characterized as a pandemic. I also noted that while the Federal Government, along with State and local governments, have taken preventive and proactive measures to slow the spread of the virus and to treat those affected, the spread of COVID–19 within our Nation's communities threatens to strain our Nation's healthcare systems.
<br>
<br>To deal with this threat, on March 18, 2020, I issued Executive Order 13909 (Prioritizing and Allocating Health and Medical Resources to Respond to the Spread of COVID–19) [set out above], in which I delegated to the Secretary of Health and Human Services the prioritization and allocation authority under section 101 of the Act with respect to health and medical resources needed to respond to the spread of COVID–19. And on March 23, 2020, I issued Executive Order 13910 (Preventing Hoarding of Health and Medical Resources to Respond to the Spread of COVID–19) [50 U.S.C. 4512 note], in which I delegated to the Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority under section 102 of the Act to combat hoarding and price gouging with respect to such resources.
<br>
<br>To ensure that our healthcare systems are able to surge capacity and capability to respond to the spread of COVID–19, it is the policy of the United States to expand domestic production of health and medical resources needed to respond to the spread of COVID–19, including personal protective equipment and ventilators. Accordingly, I am delegating authority under title III of the Act [50 U.S.C. 4531 et seq.] to guarantee loans by private institutions, make loans, make provision for purchases and commitments to purchase, and take additional actions to create, maintain, protect, expand, and restore domestic industrial base capabilities to produce such resources. To enable greater cooperation among private businesses in expanding production of and distributing such resources, I am also delegating my authority under section 708(c) and (d) of the Act (50 U.S.C. 4558(c), (d)) to provide for the making of voluntary agreements and plans of action by the private sector.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. Delegation of Authority Under Title III of the Act. (a) Notwithstanding Executive Order 13603 of March 16, 2012 (National Defense Resources Preparedness) [50 U.S.C. 4553 note], the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Homeland Security are each delegated, with respect to responding to the spread of COVID–19 within the United States, the authority of the President conferred by sections 301, 302, and 303 of the Act (50 U.S.C. 4531, 4532, and 4533), and the authority to implement the Act in subchapter III [50 U.S.C. 4551 et seq.] of chapter 55 of title 50, United States Code (50 U.S.C. 4554, 4555, 4556, and 4560).
<br>
<br>(b) The Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Homeland Security may each use the authority under sections 301, 302, and 303 of the Act, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the heads of other executive departments and agencies as he deems appropriate, to respond to the spread of COVID–19.
<br>
<br>(c) To provide additional authority to respond to the national emergency I declared in Proclamation 9994, the requirements of section 301(a)(2), section 301(d)(1)(A), and section 303(a)(1) through (a)(6) of the Act are waived during the period of that national emergency.
<br>
<br>(d) To provide additional authority to respond to the national emergency I declared in Proclamation 9994, the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Homeland Security are each authorized to submit for my approval under section 302(d)(2)(B) of the Act a proposed determination that any specific loan is necessary to avert an industrial resource or critical technology shortfall that would severely impair national defense capability.
<br>
<br>(e) Before exercising the authority delegated under this section with respect to health or medical resources, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall consult with the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. Delegation of Authority Under Title VII of the Act. (a) Notwithstanding Executive Order 13603, the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Homeland Security are each delegated, with respect to responding to the spread of COVID–19 within the United States, the authority of the President conferred by section 708(c)(1) and (d) of the Act [50 U.S.C. 4558(c)(1) and (d)]. The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall provide to the Secretary of Homeland Security notice of any use of such delegated authority.
<br>
<br>(b) The delegation made in this section is made upon the condition that the Secretary of Health and Human Services or the Secretary of Homeland Security consult with the Attorney General and with the Federal Trade Commission, and obtain the prior approval of the Attorney General, after consultation by the Attorney General with the Federal Trade Commission, as required by section 708(c)(2) of the Act, except when such consultation is waived under subsection (c) of section 3 of this order and section 708(c)(3) of the Act.
<br>
<br>(c) The Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Homeland Security are each authorized to submit for my approval under section 708(c)(3) of the Act any proposed determination that any specific voluntary agreement or plan of action is necessary to meet national defense requirements resulting from an event that degrades or destroys critical infrastructure.
<br>
<br>(d) Before exercising the authority delegated under this section with respect to health or medical resources, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall consult with the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
<br>
<br>Sec. 4. Additional Delegations. (a) Notwithstanding Executive Order 13603, the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Homeland Security are each delegated, with respect to responding to the spread of COVID–19 within the United States, the authority of the President conferred by section 107 of the Act (50 U.S.C. 4517).
<br>
<br>(b) In addition to the delegations of authority in Executive Order 13909 and Executive Order 13910, the authority of the President conferred by sections 101 and 102 of the Act (50 U.S.C. 4511, 4512) is delegated to the Secretary of Homeland Security with respect to health and medical resources needed to respond to the spread of COVID–19 within the United States.
<br>
<br>(c) The Secretary of Homeland Security may use the authority under section 101 of the Act to determine, in consultation with the heads of other executive departments and agencies as appropriate, the proper nationwide priorities and allocation of health and medical resources, including by controlling the distribution of such materials (including applicable services) in the civilian market, for responding to the spread of COVID–19 within the United States.
<br>
<br>(d) Before exercising the authority under section 102 of the Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall consult with the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
<br>
<br>(e) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall periodically consider whether the designations made by him under section 102 of the Act pursuant to section 4(b) of this order remain necessary. Upon finding that such designation of material is no longer necessary, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall promptly publish a notice of withdrawal of the designation in the Federal Register, and in such other manner as he deems appropriate.
<br>
<br>Sec. 5. Implementing Rules and Regulations. The Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall each adopt and revise appropriate rules and regulations as may be necessary to implement this order.
<br>
<br>Sec. 6. Policy Coordination. The Assistant to the President for Trade and Manufacturing Policy shall serve as National Defense Production Act Policy Coordinator.
<br>
<br>Sec. 7. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:

<br>(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or
<br>
<br>(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
<br>
<br>(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.

<br>In order to prevent hoarding, no person shall accumulate (1) in excess of the reasonable demands of business, personal, or home consumption, or (2) for the purpose of resale at prices in excess of prevailing market prices, materials which have been designated by the President as scarce materials or materials the supply of which would be threatened by such accumulation. The President shall order published in the Federal Register, and in such other manner as he may deem appropriate, every designation of materials the accumulation of which is unlawful and any withdrawal of such designation.

<br>
<br>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (50 U.S.C. 4501 et seq.) (the "Act"), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:
<br>
<br>Section 1. Policy. In Proclamation 9994 of March 13, 2020 (Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID–19) Outbreak) [50 U.S.C. 1621 note], I declared a national emergency recognizing the threat that the novel (new) coronavirus known as SARS–CoV–2 poses to our Nation's healthcare systems. In recognizing the public health risk, I noted that on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced that the outbreak of COVID–19 (the disease caused by SARS–CoV–2) can be characterized as a pandemic. I also noted that while the Federal Government, along with State and local governments, have taken preventive and proactive measures to slow the spread of the virus and to treat those affected, the spread of COVID–19 within our Nation's communities threatens to strain our Nation's healthcare systems. To further deal with this threat, on March 18, 2020, I issued Executive Order 13909 (Prioritizing and Allocating Health and Medical Resources to Respond to the Spread of COVID–19) [50 U.S.C. 4511 note], in which I delegated to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) the prioritization and allocation authority under section 101 of the Act [50 U.S.C. 4511] with respect to health and medical resources needed to respond to the spread of COVID–19.
<br>
<br>To ensure that our Nation's healthcare systems are able to surge capacity and capability to respond to the spread of COVID–19, it is the policy of the United States that health and medical resources needed to respond to the spread of COVID–19, such as personal protective equipment and sanitizing and disinfecting products, are not hoarded. Accordingly, I am delegating to the Secretary my authority under section 102 of the Act (50 U.S.C. 4512) to prevent hoarding of health and medical resources necessary to respond to the spread of COVID–19 within the United States. I am also delegating to the Secretary my authority under the Act to implement any restrictions on hoarding, including my authority under section 705 of the Act (50 U.S.C. 4555) to gather information, such as information about how supplies of such resources are distributed throughout the Nation.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. Delegation of Authority to Prevent Hoarding.
<br>
<br>(a) The Secretary is delegated the following:
<br>
<br>(i) the authority of the President conferred by section 102 of the Act to prevent hoarding of health and medical resources necessary to respond to the spread of COVID–19 within the United States, including the authority to prescribe conditions with respect to the accumulation of such resources, and to designate any material as a scarce material, or as a material the supply of which would be threatened by persons accumulating the material either in excess of reasonable demands of business, personal, or home consumption, or for the purpose of resale at prices in excess of prevailing market prices; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the authority of the President to implement the Act contained in subchapter III [50 U.S.C. 4551 et seq.] of chapter 55 of title 50, United States Code (50 U.S.C. 4554, 4555, 4556, and 4560).
<br>
<br>(b) In exercising the authority delegated under this section, the Secretary shall consult the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
<br>
<br>(c) The Secretary shall adopt and revise appropriate rules and regulations as may be necessary to implement this order.
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. Secretarial Duty Concerning Notices of Withdrawal of Designation. The Secretary shall periodically consider whether the designations made pursuant to section 2 of this order remain necessary. Upon finding that the need for such designation of material is no longer necessary, the Secretary shall promptly publish a notice of withdrawal of the designation in the Federal Register, and in such other manner as the Secretary deems appropriate.
<br>
<br>Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
<br>
<br>(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or

<br>§4531. Presidential authorization for the national defense
<br>(a) Expediting production and deliveries or services
<br>(1) Authorized activities
<br>
<br>To reduce current or projected shortfalls of industrial resources, critical technology items, or essential materials needed for national defense purposes, subject to such regulations as the President may prescribe, the President may authorize a guaranteeing agency to provide guarantees of loans by private institutions for the purpose of financing any contractor, subcontractor, provider of critical infrastructure, or other person in support of production capabilities or supplies that are deemed by the guaranteeing agency to be necessary to create, maintain, expedite, expand, protect, or restore production and deliveries or services essential to the national defense.
<br>(2) Presidential determinations required
<br>
<br>Except during a period of national emergency declared by Congress or the President, a loan guarantee may be entered into under this section only if the President determines that—
<br>
<br>(A) the loan guarantee is for an activity that supports the production or supply of an industrial resource, critical technology item, or material that is essential for national defense purposes;
<br>
<br>(B) without a loan guarantee, credit is not available to the loan applicant under reasonable terms or conditions sufficient to finance the activity;
<br>
<br>(C) the loan guarantee is the most cost effective, expedient, and practical alternative for meeting the needs of the Federal Government;
<br>
<br>(D) the prospective earning power of the loan applicant and the character and value of the security pledged provide a reasonable assurance of repayment of the loan to be guaranteed;
<br>
<br>(E) the loan to be guaranteed bears interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury to be reasonable, taking into account the then-current average yield on outstanding obligations of the United States with remaining periods of maturity comparable to the maturity of the loan;
<br>
<br>(F) the loan agreement for the loan to be guaranteed provides that no provision of the loan agreement may be amended or waived without the consent of the fiscal agent of the United States for the guarantee; and
<br>
<br>(G) the loan applicant has provided or will provide—
<br>
<br>(i) an assurance of repayment, as determined by the President; and
<br>
<br>(ii) security—
<br>
<br>(I) in the form of a performance bond, insurance, collateral, or other means acceptable to the fiscal agent of the United States; and
<br>
<br>(II) in an amount equal to not less than 20 percent of the amount of the loan.
<br>(3) Limitations on loans
<br>
<br>Loans under this section may be—
<br>
<br>(A) made or guaranteed under the authority of this section only to the extent that an appropriations Act—
<br>
<br>(i) provides, in advance, budget authority for the cost of such guarantees, as defined in section 661a of title 2; and
<br>
<br>(ii) establishes a limitation on the total loan principal that may be guaranteed; and
<br>
<br>(B) made without regard to the limitations of existing law, other than section 1341 of title 31.
<br>(b) Fiscal agents of the United States
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Any Federal agency or any Federal reserve bank, when designated by the President, is hereby authorized to act, on behalf of any guaranteeing agency, as fiscal agent of the United States in the making of such contracts of guarantee and in otherwise carrying out the purposes of this section.
<br>(2) Funds
<br>
<br>All such funds as may be necessary to enable any fiscal agent described in paragraph (1) to carry out any guarantee made by it on behalf of any guaranteeing agency shall be supplied and disbursed by or under authority from such guaranteeing agency.
<br>(3) Limit on liability
<br>
<br>No fiscal agent described in paragraph (1) shall have any responsibility or accountability, except as agent in taking any action pursuant to or under authority of this section.
<br>(4) Reimbursements
<br>
<br>Each fiscal agent described in paragraph (1) shall be reimbursed by each guaranteeing agency for all expenses and losses incurred by such fiscal agent in acting as agent on behalf of such guaranteeing agency, including, notwithstanding any other provision of law, attorneys' fees and expenses of litigation.
<br>(c) Oversight
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>All actions and operations of fiscal agents under authority of or pursuant to this section shall be subject to the supervision of the President, and to such regulations as the President may prescribe.
<br>(2) Other authority
<br>
<br>The President is authorized to prescribe—
<br>
<br>(A) either specifically or by maximum limits or otherwise, rates of interest, guarantee and commitment fees, and other charges which may be made in connection with loans, discounts, advances, or commitments guaranteed by the guaranteeing agencies through fiscal agents under this section; and
<br>
<br>(B) regulations governing the forms and procedures (which shall be uniform to the extent practicable) to be utilized in connection with such guarantees.
<br>(d) Aggregate guarantee amounts
<br>(1) Industrial resource and critical technology shortfalls
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>If the making of any guarantee or obligation of the Federal Government under this subchapter relating to a domestic industrial base shortfall would cause the aggregate outstanding amount of all guarantees for such shortfall to exceed $50,000,000, any such guarantee may be made only—
<br>
<br>(i) if the President has notified the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives in writing of the proposed guarantee; and
<br>
<br>(ii) after the 30-day period following the date on which notice under clause (i) is provided.
<br>(B) Waivers authorized
<br>
<br>The requirements of subparagraph (A) may be waived—
<br>
<br>(i) during a period of national emergency declared by Congress or the President; or
<br>
<br>(ii) upon a determination by the President, on a nondelegable basis, that a specific guarantee is necessary to avert an industrial resource or critical technology item shortfall that would severely impair national defense capability.
<br>(2) Other limitations
<br>
<br>The authority conferred by this section shall not be used primarily to prevent the financial insolvency or bankruptcy of any person, unless—
<br>
<br>(A) the President certifies that the insolvency or bankruptcy would have a direct and substantially adverse effect upon national defense production; and
<br>
<br>(B) a copy of the certification under subparagraph (A), together with a detailed justification thereof, is transmitted to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives not later than 10 days prior to the exercise of that authority for such use.

<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13922. Delegating Authority Under the Defense Production Act to the Chief Executive Officer of the United States International Development Finance Corporation To Respond to the COVID–19 Outbreak
<br>
<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13922, May 14, 2020, 85 F.R. 30583, provided:
<br>
<br>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (50 U.S.C. 4501 et seq.) (the "Act"), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:
<br>
<br>Section 1. Policy. In Proclamation 9994 of March 13, 2020 (Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID–19) Outbreak) [50 U.S.C. 1621 note], I declared a national emergency recognizing the threat that the novel (new) coronavirus known as SARS–CoV–2 poses to our Nation's healthcare systems. In recognizing the public health risk, I noted that on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced that the outbreak of COVID–19 (the disease caused by SARS–CoV–2) can be characterized as a pandemic.
<br>
<br>To ensure that our country has the capacity, capability, and strong and resilient domestic industrial base necessary to respond to the COVID–19 outbreak, it is the policy of the United States to further expand domestic production of strategic resources needed to respond to the COVID–19 outbreak, including strengthening relevant supply chains within the United States and its territories. It is important to use all resources available to the United States, including executive departments and agencies (agencies) with expertise in loan support for private institutions. Accordingly, I am delegating authority under title III of the Act [50 U.S.C. 4531 et seq.] to make loans, make provision for purchases and commitments to purchase, and take additional actions to create, maintain, protect, expand, and restore the domestic industrial base capabilities, including supply chains within the United States and its territories ("domestic supply chains"), needed to respond to the COVID–19 outbreak.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. Delegation of Authority Under Title III of the Act. (a) Notwithstanding Executive Order 13603 of March 16, 2012 (National Defense Resources Preparedness) [50 U.S.C. 4553 note], and in addition to the delegation of authority in Executive Order 13911 of March 27, 2020 (Delegating Additional Authority Under the Defense Production Act With Respect to Health and Medical Resources to Respond to the Spread of COVID–19) [50 U.S.C. 4511 note], the Chief Executive Officer of the United States International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) is delegated the authority of the President conferred by sections 302 and 303 of the Act (50 U.S.C. 4532 and 4533), and the authority to implement the Act in subchapter III of chapter 55 of title 50, United States Code (50 U.S.C. 4554, 4555, 4556, and 4560).
<br>
<br>(b) The Chief Executive Officer of the DFC may use the authority under sections 302 and 303 of the Act, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the heads of other agencies as he deems appropriate, for the domestic production of strategic resources needed to respond to the COVID–19 outbreak, or to strengthen any relevant domestic supply chains.
<br>

<br>§4533. Other presidential action authorized
<br>(a) In general
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>To create, maintain, protect, expand, or restore domestic industrial base capabilities essential for the national defense, the President may make provision—
<br>
<br>(A) for purchases of or commitments to purchase an industrial resource or a critical technology item, for Government use or resale;
<br>
<br>(B) for the encouragement of exploration, development, and mining of critical and strategic materials, and other materials;
<br>
<br>(C) for the development of production capabilities; and
<br>
<br>(D) for the increased use of emerging technologies in security program applications and the rapid transition of emerging technologies—
<br>
<br>(i) from Government-sponsored research and development to commercial applications; and
<br>
<br>(ii) from commercial research and development to national defense applications.
<br>(2) Treatment of certain agricultural commodities
<br>
<br>A purchase for resale under this subsection shall not include that part of the supply of an agricultural commodity which is domestically produced, except to the extent that such domestically produced supply may be purchased for resale for industrial use or stockpiling.
<br>(3) Terms of sales
<br>
<br>No commodity purchased under this subsection shall be sold at less than—
<br>
<br>(A) the established ceiling price for such commodity, except that minerals, metals, and materials shall not be sold at less than the established ceiling price, or the current domestic market price, whichever is lower; or
<br>
<br>(B) if no ceiling price has been established, the higher of—
<br>
<br>(i) the current domestic market price for such commodity; or
<br>
<br>(ii) the minimum sale price established for agricultural commodities owned or controlled by the Commodity Credit Corporation, as provided in section 1427 of title 7.
<br>(4) Delivery dates
<br>
<br>No purchase or commitment to purchase any imported agricultural commodity shall specify a delivery date which is more than 1 year after the date of termination of this section.
<br>(5) Presidential determinations
<br>
<br>Except as provided in paragraph (7), the President may not execute a contract under this subsection unless the President, on a non-delegable basis, determines, with appropriate explanatory material and in writing, that—
<br>
<br>(A) the industrial resource, material, or critical technology item is essential to the national defense;
<br>
<br>(B) without Presidential action under this section, United States industry cannot reasonably be expected to provide the capability for the needed industrial resource, material, or critical technology item in a timely manner; and
<br>
<br>(C) purchases, purchase commitments, or other action pursuant to this section are the most cost effective, expedient, and practical alternative method for meeting the need.
<br>(6) Notification to Congress of shortfall
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in paragraph (7), the President shall provide written notice to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives of a domestic industrial base shortfall prior to taking action under this subsection to remedy the shortfall. The notice shall include the determinations made by the President under paragraph (5).
<br>(B) Aggregate amounts
<br>
<br>If the taking of any action under this subsection to correct a domestic industrial base shortfall would cause the aggregate outstanding amount of all such actions for such shortfall to exceed $50,000,000, the action or actions may be taken only after the 30-day period following the date on which the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives have been notified in writing of the proposed action.
<br>(C) Limitation
<br>
<br>If the taking of any action or actions under this section to correct an industrial resource shortfall would cause the aggregate outstanding amount of all such actions for such industrial resource shortfall to exceed $50,000,000, no such action or actions may be taken, unless such action or actions are authorized to exceed such amount by an Act of Congress.
<br>(7) Waivers authorized
<br>
<br>The requirements of paragraphs (1) through (6) may be waived—
<br>
<br>(A) during a period of national emergency declared by the Congress or the President; or
<br>
<br>(B) upon a determination by the President, on a nondelegable basis, that action is necessary to avert an industrial resource or critical technology item shortfall that would severely impair national defense capability.
<br>(b) Exemption for certain limitations
<br>
<br>Subject to the limitations in subsection (a), purchases and commitments to purchase and sales under subsection (a) may be made without regard to the limitations of existing law (other than section 1341 of title 31), for such quantities, and on such terms and conditions, including advance payments, and for such periods, but not extending beyond a date that is not more than 10 years from the date on which such purchase, purchase commitment, or sale was initially made, as the President deems necessary, except that purchases or commitments to purchase involving higher than established ceiling prices (or if no such established ceiling prices exist, currently prevailing market prices) or anticipated loss on resale shall not be made, unless it is determined that supply of the materials could not be effectively increased at lower prices or on terms more favorable to the Government, or that such purchases are necessary to assure the availability to the United States of overseas supplies.
<br>(c) Presidential findings
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The President may take the actions described in paragraph (2), if the President finds that—
<br>
<br>(A) under generally fair and equitable ceiling prices, for any raw or nonprocessed material, there will result a decrease in supplies from high-cost sources of such material, and that the continuation of such supplies is necessary to carry out the objectives of this subchapter; or
<br>
<br>(B) an increase in cost of transportation is temporary in character and threatens to impair maximum production or supply in any area at stable prices of any materials.
<br>(2) Subsidy payments authorized
<br>
<br>Upon a finding under paragraph (1), the President may make provision for subsidy payments on any such domestically produced material, other than an agricultural commodity, in such amounts and in such manner (including purchases of such material and its resale at a loss), and on such terms and conditions, as the President determines to be necessary to ensure that supplies from such high-cost sources are continued, or that maximum production or supply in such area at stable prices of such materials is maintained, as the case may be.
<br>(d) Incidental authority
<br>
<br>The procurement power granted to the President by this section shall include the power to transport and store and have processed and refined any materials procured under this section.
<br>(e) Installation of equipment in industrial facilities
<br>(1) Installation authorized
<br>
<br>If the President determines that such action will aid the national defense, the President is authorized—
<br>
<br>(A) to procure and install additional equipment, facilities, processes or improvements to plants, factories, and other industrial facilities owned by the Federal Government;
<br>
<br>(B) to procure and install equipment owned by the Federal Government in plants, factories, and other industrial facilities owned by private persons;
<br>

<br>
<br>(D) to sell or otherwise transfer equipment owned by the Federal Government and installed under this subsection to the owners of such plants, factories, or other industrial facilities.
<br>(2) Indemnification
<br>
<br>The owner of any plant, factory, or other industrial facility that receives equipment owned by the Federal Government under this section shall agree—
<br>
<br>(A) to waive any claim against the United States under section 9607 or 9613 of title 42; and
<br>
<br>(B) to indemnify the United States against any claim described in paragraph (1) made by a third party that arises out of the presence or use of equipment owned by the Federal Government.
<br>(f) Excess metals, minerals, and materials
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, metals, minerals, and materials acquired pursuant to this section which, in the judgment of the President, are excess to the needs of programs under this chapter, shall be transferred to the National Defense Stockpile established by the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act (50 U.S.C. 98 et seq.), when the President deems such action to be in the public interest.
<br>(2) Transfers at no charge
<br>
<br>Transfers made pursuant to this subsection shall be made without charge against or reimbursement from funds appropriated for the purposes of the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act (50 U.S.C. 98 et seq.), except that costs incident to such transfer, other than acquisition costs, shall be paid or reimbursed from such funds.
<br>(g) Substitutes
<br>
<br>When, in the judgement of the President, it will aid the national defense, the President may make provision for the development of substitutes for strategic and critical materials, critical components, critical technology items, and other industrial resources.
