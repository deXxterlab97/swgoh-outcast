<br>are situate Bethsan with its towns, and Jezrael in the midst of the valley, have chariots of iron. 17 And Josue said to the house of Joseph, to Ephraim and Manasses: Thou art a great people, and of great strength, thou shalt not have one lot
<br>only:
<br>18 But thou shalt pass to the mountain, and shalt cut down the wood, and make thyself room to dwell in: and mayst proceed farther, when thou hast destroyed the Chanaanites, who as thou sayest have iron chariots, and are very strong.
<br>
<br>Chapter 18
<br>And all the children of Israel assembled together in Silo, and there they set up the tabernacle of the testimony, and the land was subdued before them.
<br>But there remained seven tribes of the chil- dren of Israel, which as yet had not received their possessions.
<br>And Josue said to them: How long are you indolent and slack, and go not in to possess the land which the Lord the God of your fathers hath given you?
<br>Choose of every tribe three men, that I may send them, and they may go and compass the land, and mark it out according to the number of each multitude: and bring back to me what they have marked out.
<br>Divide to yourselves the land into seven parts: let Juda be in his bounds on the south side, and the house of Joseph on the north.
<br>The land in the midst between these mark ye out into seven parts; and you shall come hither to me, that I may cast lots for you before the Lord your God.
<br>For the Levites have no part among you,
<br> 
<br>but the priesthood of the Lord is their inheri- tance. And Gad and Ruben, and the half tribe of Manasses have already received their posses- sions beyond the Jordan eastward: which Moses the servant of the Lord gave them.
<br>And when the men were risen up, to go to mark out the land, Josue commanded them say- ing: Go round the land and mark it out, and return to me: that I may cast lots for you before the Lord in Silo.
<br>So they went and surveying it divided it into seven parts, writing them down in a book. And they returned to Josue, to the camp in Silo.
<br>And he cast lots before the Lord in Silo, and divided the land to the children of Israel into seven parts.
<br>And first came up the lot of the children of Benjamin by their families, to possess the land between the children of Juda, and the children of Joseph.
<br>And their border northward was from the Jordan: going along by the side of Jericho on the north side, and thence going up westward to the mountains, and reaching to the wilderness of Bethaven,
<br>And passing along southward by Luza, the same is Bethel, and it goeth down into Ataroth- addar to the mountain, that is on the south of the nether Beth-horon.
<br>And it bendeth thence going round towards the sea, south of the mountain that looketh to- wards Beth-horon to the southwest: and the outgoings thereof are into Cariathbaal, which is called also Cariathiarim, a city of the children of Juda This is their coast towards the sea, west- ward.
<br>But on the south side the border goeth out from part of Cariathiarim towards the sea, and cometh to the fountain of the waters of Nephtoa.
<br>And it goeth down to that part of the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>mountain that looketh on the valley of the chil- dren of Ennom: and is over against the north quarter in the furthermost part of the valley of Raphaim, and it goeth down into Geennom (that is the valley of Ennom) by the side of the Je- busite to the south: and cometh to the fountain of Rogel,
<br>Passing thence to the north, and going out to Ensemes, that is to say, the fountain of the sun:
<br>And It passeth along to the hills that are over against the ascent of Adommim: and it goeth down to Abenboen, that is, the stone of Boen the son of Ruben: and it passeth on the north side to the champaign countries; and goeth down Into the plain,
<br>And it passeth by Bethhagla northward: and the outgoings thereof are towards the north of the most salt sea at the south end of the Jor- dan.
<br>Which is the border of it on the east side. This is the possession of the children of Benjamin by their borders round about, and their families.
<br>And their cities were, Jericho and Beth- hagla and Vale-Casis,
<br>Betharaba and Samaraim and Bethel,
<br>And Avim and Aphara and Ophera,
<br>The town Emona and Ophni and Gabee: twelve cities, and their villages.
<br>Gabam and Rama and Beroth,
<br>And Mesphe, and Caphara, and Amosa,
<br>And Recem, Jarephel, and Tharela,
<br>And Sela, Eleph and Jebus, which is Jerusalem, Gabaath and Cariath: fourteen cities, and their villages. This is the possession of the children of Benjamin by their families.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 19
<br>And the second lot came forth for the children of Simeon by their kindreds: and their inheritance was
<br>In the midst of the possession of the children of Juda: Bersabee and Sabee and Molada
<br>And Hasersual, Bala and Asem,
<br>And Eltholad, Bethul and Harma,
<br>And Siceleg and Bethmarchaboth and Hasersusa,
<br>And Bethlebaoth and Sarohen:	thirteen cities, and their villages.
<br>And Remmon and Athor and Asan: four cities, and their villages.
<br>And all the villages round about these cities to Baalath Beer Ramath to the south quarter. This is the inheritance of the children of Simeon according to their kindreds,
<br>In the possession and lot of the children of Juda: because it was too great, and therefore the children of Simeon had their possession in the midst of their inheritance.
<br>And the third lot fell to the children of Zabulon by their kindreds: and the border of their possession was unto Sarid.
<br>And It went up from the sea and from Mer- ala, and came to Debbaseth: as far as the tor- rent, which is over against Jeconam.
<br>And it returneth from Sarid eastward to the borders of Ceseleththabor: and it goeth out to Dabereth and ascendeth towards Japhie.
<br>And it passeth along from thence to the east side of Gethhepher and Thacasin: and goeth out to Remmon, Amthar and Noa.
<br>And it turneth about to the north of Hanathon: and the outgoings thereof are the val- ley of Jephtahel,
<br>And Cateth and Naalol and Semeron and Jedala and Bethlehem: twelve cities and their
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>villages.
<br>This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Zabulon by their kindreds, the cities and their villages.
<br>The fourth lot came out to Issachar by their kindreds.
<br>And his inheritance was Jezrael and Casa- loth and Sunem,
<br>And Hapharaim and Seon and Anaharath,
<br>And Rabboth and Cesion, Abes,
<br>And Rameth and Engannim and Enhadda and Bethpheses.
<br>And the border thereof cometh to Thabor and Sehesima and Bethsames: and the outgoings thereof shall be at the Jordan: sixteen cities, and their villages.
<br>This is the possession of the sons of Issachar by their kindreds, the cities and their villages.
<br>And the fifth lot fell to the tribe of the children of Aser by their kindreds:
<br>And their border was Halcath and Chali and Beten and Axaph,
<br>And Elmelech and Amaad and Messal: and it reacheth to Carmel by the sea and Sihor and Labanath,
<br>And it returneth towards the east to Bethdagon: and passeth along to Zabulon and to the valley of Jephthael towards the north to Bethemec and Nehiel.   And it goeth out to the left side of Cabul,
<br>And to Abaran and Rohob and Hamon and Cana, as far as the great Sidon.
<br>And it returneth to Horma to the strong city of Tyre, and to Hosa: and the outgoings thereof shall be at the sea from the portion of Achziba:
<br>And Amma and Aphec and Rohob: twenty-two cities, and their villages.
<br>This is the possession of the children of Aser by their kindreds, and the cities and their
<br> 
<br>villages.
<br>The sixth lot came out to the sons of Neph- tali by their families:
<br>And the border began from Heleph and Elon to Saananim, and Adami, which is Neceb, and Jebnael even to Lecum:
<br>And the border returneth westward to Azanotthabor, and goeth out from thence to Hu- cuca, and passeth along to Zabulon southward, and to Aser westward, and to Juda upon the Jordan towards the rising of the sun.
<br>And the strong cities are Assedim, Ser, and Emath, and Reccath and Cenereth,
<br>And Edema and Arama, Asor,
<br>And Cedes and Edri, Enhasor,
<br>And Jeron and Magdalel, Horem, and Bethanath and Bethsames: nineteen cities, and their villages.
<br>This is the possession of the tribe of the children of Nephtali by their kindreds, the cities and their villages.
<br>The seventh lot came out to the tribe of the children of Dan by their families
<br>And the border of their possession was Saraa and Esthaol, and Hirsemes, that is, the city of the sun,
<br>Selebin and Aialon and Jethela,
<br>Elon and Themna and Acron,
<br>Elthece, Gebbethon and Balaath,
<br>And Juda and Bane and Barach and Geth- remmon:
<br>And Mejarcon and Arecon, with the border that looketh towards Joppe,
<br>And is terminated there. And the children of Dan went up and fought against Lesem, and took it: and they put it to the sword, and pos- sessed it, and dwelt in it, calling the name of it Lesem Dan, by the name of Dan their father.
<br>This is the possession of the tribe of the sons of Dan, by their kindreds, the cities and
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>their villages.
<br>And when he had made an end of dividing the land by lot to each one by their tribes, the children of Israel gave a possession to Josue the son of Nun in the midst of them,
<br>According to the commandment of the Lord, the city which he asked for, Thamnath Saraa, in mount Ephraim: and he built up the city, and dwelt in it.
<br>These are the possessions which Eleazar the priest, and Josue the son of Nun, and the princes of the families, and of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed by lot in Silo, be- fore the Lord at the door of the tabernacle of the testimony, and they divided the land.
<br>
<br>Chapter 20
<br>And the Lord spoke to Josue, saying: Speak to children of Israel and say to them:
<br>Appoint cities of refuge, of which I spoke to you by the hand of Moses:
<br>That whosoever shall kill a person unawares may flee to them, and may escape the wrath of the kinsman, who is the avenger of blood.
<br>And when he shall flee to one of these cities: he shall stand before the gate of the city, and shall speak to the ancients of that city, such things as prove him innocent: and so shall they receive him, and give him a place to dwell in.
<br>And when the avenger of blood shall pursue him, they shall not deliver him into his hands, because he slew his neighbour unawares, and is not proved to have been his enemy two or three days before,
<br>And he shall dwell in that city, till he stand before judgment to give an account of his fact, and till the death of the high priest, who shall be at that time: then shall the manslayer return,
<br> 
<br>and go into his own city and house from whence he fled.
<br>And they appointed Cedes in Galilee of mount Nephtali, and Sichem in mount Ephraim, and Cariath-Arbe, the same is Hebron in the mountain of Juda.
<br>And beyond the Jordan to the east of Jeri- cho, they appointed Bosor, which is upon the plain of the wilderness of the tribe of Ruben, and Ramoth in Galaad of the tribe of Gad, and Gaulon in Basan of the tribe of Manasses.
<br>These cities were appointed for all the chil- dren of Israel, and for the strangers, that dwelt among them, that whosoever had killed a per- son unawares might flee to them, and not die by the hand of the kinsman, coveting to revenge the blood that was shed, until he should stand before the people to lay open his cause.
<br>
<br>Chapter 21
<br>Then the princes of the families of Levi came to Eleazar the priest, and to Josue the son of Nun, and to the princes of the kindreds of all the tribes of the children of Israel
<br>2 And they spoke to them in Silo in the land of Chanaan, and said: The Lord commanded by the hand of Moses, that cities should be given us to dwell in, and their suburbs to feed our cattle. 3 And the children of Israel gave out of their possessions according to the commandment of
<br>the Lord, cities and their suburbs.
<br>And the lot came out for the family of Caath of the children of Aaron the priest out of the tribes of Juda, and of Simeon, and of Benjamin, thirteen cities.
<br>And to the rest of the children of Caath, that is, to thee Levites, who remained, out of the tribes of Ephraim, and of Dan, and the half
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>tribe of Manasses, ten cities.
<br>And the lot came out to children of Gerson, that they should take of the tribes of Issachar and of Aser and of Nephtali, and of the half tribe of Manasses in Basan, thirteen cities.
<br>And to the sons of Merari by their kindreds, of the tribes of Ruben and of Gad and of Zabu- lon, twelve cities.
<br>And the children of Israel gave to the Levites the cities and their suburbs, as the Lord com- manded by the hand of Moses, giving to every one by lot.
<br>Of the tribes of the children of Juda and of Simeon Josue gave cities: whose names are these,
<br>To the sons of Aaron, of the families of Caath of the race of Levi (for the first lot came out for them)
<br>The city of Arbe the father of Enac, which is called Hebron, in the mountain of Juda, and the suburbs thereof round about.
<br>But the fields and the villages thereof he had given to Caleb the son of Jephone for his possession.
<br>He gave therefore to the children of Aaron the priest, Hebron a city of refuge, and the suburbs thereof, and Lebna with the suburbs thereof,
<br>And Jether and Estemo,
<br>And Holon, and Dabir,
<br>And Ain, and Jeta, and Bethsames, with their suburbs: nine cities out of the two tribes, as hath been said.
<br>And out of the tribe of the children of Ben- jamin, Gabaon, and Gabae,
<br>And Anathoth and Almon, with, their sub- urbs: four cities.
<br>All the cities together of the children of Aaron the priest, were thirteen, with their sub- urbs,
<br> 
<br>And to the rest of the families of the chil- dren of Caath of the race of Levi was given this possession.
<br>Of the tribe of Ephraim, Sichem one of the cities of refuge, with the suburbs thereof in mount Ephraim, and Gazer,
<br>And Cibsaim, and Beth-horon, with their suburbs, four cities.
<br>And of he tribe of Dan, Eltheco and Gabathon,
<br>And Aialon and Gethremmon, with their suburbs, four cities.
<br>And of the half tribe of Manasses, Thanac and Gethremmon, with their suburbs, two cities. 26 All the cities were ten, with their suburbs, which were given to the children of Caath, of the
<br>inferior degree.
<br>To the children of Gerson also of the race of Levi out of the half tribe of Manasses, Gaulon in Basan, one of the cities of refuge, and Bosra, with their suburbs, two cities.
<br>And of the tribe of Issachar, Cesion, and Dabereth,
<br>And Jaramoth, and Engannim, with their suburbs, four cities.
<br>And of the tribe of Aser, Masal and Abdon,
<br>And Helcath, and Rohob, with their sub- urbs, four cities.
<br>Of the tribe also of Nephtali, Cedes in Galilee, one of the cities of refuge: and Ham- moth Dor, and Carthan, with their suburbs, three cities.
<br>All the cities of the families of Gerson, were thirteen, with their suburbs.
<br>And to the children of Merari, Levites of the inferior degree, by their families were given of the tribe of Zabulon, Jecnam and Cartha,
<br>And Damna and Naalol, four cities with their suburbs.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Of the tribe of Ruben beyond the Jordan over against Jericho, Bosor in the wilderness, one of the cities of refuge, Misor and Jaser and Jeth- son and Mephaath, four cities with their sub- urbs.
<br>Of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Galaad, one of the cities of refuge, and Manaim and Hesebon and Jaser, four cities with their suburbs,
<br>All the cities of the children of Merari by their families and kindreds, were twelve.
<br>So all the cities of the Levites within the possession of the children of Israel were forty- eight,
<br>With their suburbs, each distributed by the families.
<br>And the Lord God gave to Israel all the land that he had sworn to give to their fathers: and they possessed it, and dwelt in it.
<br>And he gave them peace from all nations round about: and none of their enemies durst stand against them, but were brought under their dominion.
<br>Not so much as one word, which he had promised to perform unto them, was made void, but all came to pass.
<br>
<br>Chapter 22
<br>At the same time Josue called the Rubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasses, 2 And said to them: You have done all that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you:
<br>you have also obeyed me in all things,
<br>Neither have you left your brethren this long time, until this present day, keeping the com- mandment of the Lord your God.
<br>Therefore as the Lord your God hath given your brethren rest and peace, as he promised: return, and go to your dwellings, and to the land
<br> 
<br>of your possession, which Moses the servant of the Lord gave you beyond the Jordan:
<br>Yet so that you observe attentively, and in work fulfil the commandment and the law which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you: that you love the Lord your God, and walk in all his ways, and keep all his commandments, and cleave to him, and serve him with all your heart, and with all your soul.
<br>And Josue blessed them, and sent them away, and they returned to their dwellings.
<br>Now to half the tribe of Manasses, Moses had given a possession in Basan: and therefore to the half that remained, Josue gave a lot among the rest of their brethren beyond the Jordan to the west. And when he sent them away to their dwellings and had blessed them,
<br>He said to them: With much substance and riches, you return to your settlements, with sil- ver and gold, brass and iron, and variety of rai- ment: divide the prey of your enemies with your brethren.
<br>So the children of Ruben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasses returned, and parted from the children of Israel in Silo, which is in Chanaan, to go into Galaad the land of their possession, which they had obtained ac- cording to the commandment of the Lord by the hand of Moses.
<br>And when they were come to banks of the Jordan, in the land of Chanaan, they built an altar immensely great near the Jordan.
<br>And when the children of Israel had heard of it, and certain messengers brought them an account that the children of Ruben, and of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasses had built an altar in the land of Chanaan, upon the banks of the Jordan, over against the children of Israel:
<br>They all assembled in Silo, to go up and fight against them.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>And in the mean time they sent to them into the land of Galaad, Phinees the son of Eleazar the priest,
<br>And ten princes with him, one of every tribe.
<br>Who came to the children of Ruben, and of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasses, into the land of Galaad, and said to them:
<br>Thus saith all the people of the Lord: What meaneth this transgression? Why have you for- saken the Lord the God of Israel, building a sac- rilegious altar, and revolting from the worship of him?
<br>Is it a small thing to you that you sinned with Beelphegor, and the stain of that crime re- maineth in us to this day? and many of the people perished.
<br>And you have forsaken the Lord to day, and to morrow his wrath will rage against all Israel. 19 But if you think the land of your possession to be unclean, pass over to the land wherein is the tabernacle of the Lord, and dwell among us: only depart not from the Lord, and from our society, by building an altar beside the altar of
<br>the Lord our God.
<br>Did not Achan the son of Zare transgress the commandment of the Lord, and his wrath lay upon all the people of Israel? And he was but one man, and would to God he alone had perished in his wickedness.
<br>And the children of Ruben, and of Gad, and of the half tribe of Manasses answered the princes of the embassage of Israel:
<br>The Lord the most mighty God, the Lord the most mighty God, he knoweth, and Israel also shall understand: If with the design of trans- gression we have set up this altar, let him not save us, but punish us immediately:
<br>And if we did it with that mind, that we might lay upon it holocausts, and sacrifice, and
<br> 
<br>victims of peace offerings, let him require and judge:
<br>And not rather with this thought and de- sign, that we should say: To morrow your chil- dren will say to our children: What have you to do with the Lord the God of Israel?
<br>The Lord hath put the river Jordan for a border between us and you, O ye children of Ruben, and ye children of Gad: and therefore you have no part in the Lord. And by this occa- sion your children shall turn away our children from the fear of the Lord. We therefore thought it best,
<br>And said: Let us build us an altar, not for holocausts, nor to offer victims,
<br>But for a testimony between us and you, and our posterity and yours, that we may serve the Lord, and that we may have a right to of- fer both holocausts, and victims and sacrifices of peace offerings: and that your children to mor- row may not say to our children: You have no part in the Lord.
<br>And if they will say so, they shall answer them: Behold the altar of the Lord, which our fathers made, not for holocausts, nor for sacri- fice, but for a testimony between us and you.
<br>God keep us from any such wickedness that we should revolt from the Lord, and leave off following his steps, by building an altar to of- fer holocausts, and sacrifices, and victims, beside the altar of the Lord our God, which is erected before his tabernacle.
<br>And when Phinees the priest, and the princes of the embassage, who were with him, had heard this, they were satisfied: and they ad- mitted most willingly the words of the children of Ruben, and Gad, and of the half tribe of Man- asses,
<br>And Phinees the priest the son of Eleazar said to them: Now we know that the Lord is with
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>us, because you are not guilty of this revolt, and you have delivered the children of Israel from the hand of the Lord.
<br>And he returned with the princes from the children of Ruben and Gad, out of the land of Galaad, into the land of Chanaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again.
<br>And the saying pleased all that heard it. And the children of Israel praised God, and they no longer said that they would go up against them, and fight, and destroy the land of their possession.
<br>And the children of Ruben, and the chil- dren of Gad called the altar which they had built, Our testimony, that the Lord is God,
<br>
<br>Chapter 23
<br>And when a long time was passed, after that the Lord had given peace to Israel, all the nations round about being subdued. and Josue being now old, and far advanced in years:
<br>Josue called for all Israel, and for the elders, and for the princes, and for the judges, and for the masters, and said to them: I am old, and far advanced in years,
<br>And you see all that the Lord your God hath done to all the nations round about, how he him- self hath fought for you:
<br>And now since he hath divided to you by lot all the land, from the east of the Jordan unto the great sea, ant many nations yet remain:
<br>The Lord your God will destroy them, and take them away from before your face, and you shall possess the land as he hath promised you. 6 Only take courage, and be careful to observe all things that are written in the book of the law of Moses: and turn not aside from them neither
<br>to the right hand nor to the left:
<br> 
<br>Lest after that you are come in among the Gentiles, who will remain among you, you should swear by the name of their gods, and serve them, and adore them:
<br>But cleave ye unto the Lord your God, as you have done until this day.
<br>And then the Lord God will take away before your eyes nations that are great and very strong, and no man shall be able to resist you.
<br>One of you shall chase a thousand men of the enemies: because the Lord your God himself will fight for you, as he hath promised.
<br>This only take care of with all diligence, that you love the Lord your God.
<br>But if you will embrace the errors of these nations that dwell among you, and make mar- riages with them, and join friendships:
<br>Know ye for a certainty that the Lord your God will not destroy them before your face, but they shall be a pit and a snare in your way, and a stumbling-block at your side, and stakes in your eyes, till he take you away and destroy you from off this excellent land, which he hath given you. 14 Behold this day I am going into the way of all the earth, and you shall know with all your mind that of all the words which the Lord promised to perform for you, not one hath failed, 15 Therefore as he hath fulfilled in deed, what he promised, and all things prosperous have come: so will he bring upon you all the evils he hath threatened, till he take you away and destroy you from off this excellent land, which
<br>he hath given you,
<br>16 When you shall have transgressed the covenant of the Lord your God, which he hath made with you, and shall have served strange gods, and adored them: then shall the indig- nation of the Lord rise up quickly and speedily against you, and you shall be taken away from this excellent land, which he hath delivered to
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>you.
<br>
<br>Chapter 24
<br>And Josue gathered together all the tribes of Is- rael in Sichem, and called for the ancients, and the princes and the judges, and the masters: and they stood in the sight of the Lord:
<br>2	And he spoke thus to the people: Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: Your fathers dwelt of old on the other side of the river, Thare the father of Abraham, and Nachor: and they served strange gods.
<br>3	And I took your father Abraham from the borders of Mesopotamia: and brought him into the land of Chanaan:  and I multiplied his seed, 4 And gave him Isaac: and to him again I gave Jacob and Esau. And I gave to Esau mount Seir for his possession: but Jacob and his children
<br>went down into Egypt.
<br>And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I struck Egypt with many signs and wonders.
<br>And I brought you and your fathers out of Egypt, and you came to the sea: and the Egyp- tians pursued your fathers with chariots and horsemen, as far as the Red Sea.
<br>And the children of Israel cried to the Lord: and he put darkness between you and the Egyp- tians, and brought the sea upon them, and cov- ered them. Your eyes saw all that I did in Egypt, and you dwelt in the wilderness a long time.
<br>And I brought you into the land of the Am- orrhite, who dwelt beyond the Jordan. And when they fought against you, I delivered them into your hands, and you possessed their land, and slew them.
<br>And Balac son of Sephor king of Moab arose and fought against Israel. And he sent and called for Balaam son of Beor, to curse you:
<br> 
<br>And I would not hear him, but on the con- trary I blessed you by him, and I delivered you out of his hand.
<br>And you passed over the Jordan, and you came to Jericho. And the men of that city fought against you, the Amorrhite, and the Pherezite, and the Chanaanite, and the Hethite, and the Gergesite, and the Hevite, and the Jebusite: and I delivered them into your hands.
<br>And I sent before you and I drove them out from their places, the two kings of the Am- orrhites, not with thy sword nor with thy bow,
<br>And I gave you a land, in which you had not laboured, and cities to dwell in which you built not, vineyards and oliveyards, which you planted not.
<br>Now therefore fear the Lord, and serve him with a perfect and most sincere heart: and put away the gods which your fathers served in Mesopotamia and in Egypt, and serve the Lord. 15 But if it seem evil to you to serve the Lord, you have your choice: choose this day that which pleaseth you, whom you would rather serve, whether the gods which your fathers served in Mesopotamia, or the gods of the Amorrhites, in whose land you dwell: but as for me and my
<br>house we will serve thee Lord,
<br>And the people answered, and said, God forbid we should leave the Lord, and serve strange gods.
<br>The Lord our God he brought us and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage: and did very great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way by which we jour- neyed, and among all the people through whom we passed.
<br>And he hath cast out all the nations, the Amorrhite the inhabitant of the land into which we are come. Therefore we will serve the Lord, for he is our God.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>And Josue said to the people: You will not be able to serve the Lord: for he is a holy God, and mighty and jealous, and will not forgive your wickedness and sins.
<br>If you leave the Lord, and serve strange gods, he will turn, and will afflict you, and will destroy you after all the good he hath done you. 21 And the people said to Josue: No, it shall not be so as thou sayest, but we will serve the
<br>Lord.
<br>And Josue said to the people, You are wit- nesses, that you yourselves have chosen you the Lord to serve him. And they answered: We are witnesses.
<br>Now therefore, said he, put away strange gods from among you, and incline your hearts to the Lord the God of Israel.
<br>And the people said to Josue: We will serve the Lord our God, and we will be obedient to his commandments.
<br>Josue therefore on that day made a covenant, and set before the people command- ments and judgments in Sichem.
<br>And he wrote all these things in the vol- ume of the law of the Lord: and he took a great stone, and set it under the oak that was in the sanctuary of the Lord.
<br>And he said to all the people: Behold this stone shall be a testimony unto you, that it hath heard all the words of the Lord, which he hath spoken to you: lest perhaps hereafter you will deny it, and lie to the Lord your God.
<br>And he sent the people away every one to their own possession,
<br>And after these things Josue the son of Nun the servant of the Lord died, being a hundred and ten years old:
<br>And they buried him in the border of his possession in Thamnathsare, which is situate in mount Ephraim, on the north side of mount
<br> 
<br>Gaas.
<br>And Israel served the Lord all the days of Josue, and of the ancients that lived a long time after Josue, and that had known all the works of the Lord which he had done in Israel.
<br>And the bones of Joseph which the children of Israel had taken out of Egypt, they buried in Sichem, in that part of the field which Jacob had bought of the sons of Hemor the father of Sichem, for a hundred young ewes, and it was in the possession of the sons of Joseph.
<br>Eleazar also the son of Aaron died: and they buried him in Gabaath that belongeth to Phinees his son, which was given him in mount Ephraim.

<br>Chapter 1
<br>
<br>After the death of Josue, the children of Israel consulted the Lord, saying: Who shall go up be- fore us against the Chanaanite, and shall be the leader of the war?
<br>And the Lord said: Juda shall go up: behold I have delivered the land into his hands.
<br>And Juda said to Simeon, his brother: Come up with me into my lot, and fight against the Chanaanite, that I also may go along with thee into thy lot. And Simeon went with him.
<br>And Juda went up, and the Lord deliv- ered the Chanaanite, and the Pherezite into their hands: and they slew of them in Bezec ten thou- sand men.
<br>And they found Adonibezec in Bezec, and fought against him, and they defeated the Chanaanite, and the Pherezite.
<br>And Adonibezec fled: and they pursued af- ter him and took him, and cut off his fingers and toes.
<br>And Adonibezec said: Seventy kings, hav- ing their fingers and toes cut off, gathered up the leavings of the meat under my table: as I have done, so hath God requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.
<br>And the children of Juda besieging Jerusalem, took it, and put it to the sword, and set the whole city on fire.
<br>And afterwards they went down and fought
<br> 
<br>against the Chanaanite, who dwelt in the moun- tains, and in the south, and in the plains.
<br>And departing from thence, he went to the inhabitants of Dabir, the ancient name of which was Cariath-Sepher, that is, the city of letters.
<br>And Caleb said: He that shall take Cariath-Sepher, and lay it waste, to him will I give my daughter Axa to wife.
<br>And Othoniel, the son of Cenez, the younger brother of Caleb, having taken it, he gave him Axa his daughter to wife.
<br>And as she was going on her way, her hus- band admonished her to ask a field of her father. And as she sighed sitting on her ass, Caleb said to her: What aileth thee?
<br>But she answered: Give me a blessing, for thou hast given me a dry land: give me also a watery land So Caleb gave her the upper and the nether watery ground.
<br>And the children of the Cinite, the kinsman of Moses, went up from the city of palms, with the children of Juda, into the wilderness of his lot, which is at the south side of Arad, and they dwelt with him.
<br>And Juda went with Simeon, his brother, and they together defeated the Chanaanites that dwelt in Sephaath, and slew them. And the name of the city was called Horma, that is, Anathema.
<br>And Juda took Gaza, with its confines, and Ascalon, and Accaron, with their confines.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>And the Lord was with Juda, and he pos- sessed the hill country: but was not able to de- stroy the inhabitants of the valley, because they had many chariots armed with scythes.
<br>And they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had said, who destroyed out of it the three sons of Enac.
<br>But the sons of Benjamin did not destroy the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem: and the Jebusite hath dwelt with the sons of Benjamin in Jerusalem until this present day.
<br>The house of Joseph also went up against Bethel, and the Lord was with them.
<br>For when they were besieging the city, which before was called Luza,
<br>They saw a man coming out of the city, and they said to him: Shew us the entrance into the city, and we will shew thee mercy.
<br>And when he had shewed them, they smote the city with the edge of the sword: but that man, and all his kindred, they let go:
<br>Who being sent away, went into the land of Hetthim, and built there a city, and called it Luza: which is so called until this day.
<br>Manasses also did not destroy Bethsan, and Thanac, with their villages; nor the inhabitants of Dor, and Jeblaam, and Mageddo, with their villages. And the Chanaanite began to dwell with them.
<br>But after Israel was grown strong, he made them tributaries, and would not destroy them.
<br>Ephraim also did not slay the Chanaanite that dwelt in Gazer, bnt dwelt with him.
<br>Zabulon destroyed not the inhabitants of Cetron, and Naalol: but the Chanaanite dwelt among them, and became their tributary.
<br>Aser also destroyed not the inhabitants of Accho, and of Sidon, of Ahalab, and of Achazib, and of Helba, and of Aphec, and of Rohob:
<br> 
<br>And he dwelt in the midst of the Chanaan- ites, the inhabitants of that land, and did not slay them.
<br>Nephthali also destroyed not the inhabi- tants of Bethsames, and of Bethanath: and he dwelt in the midst of the Chanaanites, the in- habitants of the land, and the Bethsamites and Bethanites were tributaries to him.
<br>And the Amorrhite straitened the children of Dan in the mountain, and gave them not a place to go down to the plain:
<br>And he dwelt in the mountain Hares, that is, of potsherds, in Aialon and Salebim. And the hand of the house of Joseph was heavy upon him, and he became tributary to him.
<br>And the border of the Amorrhite was from the ascent of the scorpion, the rock, and the higher places.
<br>
<br>Chapter 2
<br>And an angel of the Lord went up from Galgal to the place of weepers, and said: I made you go out of Egypt, and have brought you into the land for which I swore to your fathers: and I promised that I would not make void my covenant with you for ever:
<br>On condition that you should not make a league with the inhabitants of this land, but should throw down their altars: and you would not hear my voice: why have you done this?
<br>Wherefore I would not destroy them from before your face; that you may have enemies, and their gods may be your ruin.
<br>And when the angel of the Lord spoke these words to all the children of Israel: they lifted up their voice, and wept.
<br>And the name of that place was called, The place of weepers, or of tears: and there they of-
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>fered sacrifices to the Lord.
<br>And Josue sent away the people, and the children of Israel went every one to his own pos- session to hold it:
<br>And they served the Lord all his days, and the days of the ancients, that lived a long time after him, and who knew all the works of the Lord, which he had done for Israel.
<br>And Josue, the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died, being a hundred and ten years old;
<br>And they buried him in the borders of his possession in Thamnathsare, in Mount Ephraim, on the north side of Mount Gaas.
<br>And all that generation was gathered to their fathers: and there arose others that knew not the Lord and the works which he had done for Israel.
<br>And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord, and they served Baalim
<br>And they left the Lord, the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt: and they followed strange gods, and the gods of the people that dwelt round about them, and they adored them: and they provoked the Lord to anger,
<br>Forsaking him, and serving Baal and As- taroth
<br>And the Lord being angry against Israel, delivered them into the hands of plunderers: who took them and sold them to their enemies, that dwelt round about: neither could they stand against their enemies:
<br>But whithersoever they meant to go, the hand of the Lord was upon them, as he had said, and as he had sworn to them: and they were greatly distressed.
<br>And the Lord raised up judges, to deliver them from the hands of those that oppressed them: but they would not hearken to them,
<br> 
<br>Committing fornication with strange gods, and adoring them. They quickly forsook the way, in which their fathers had walked: and hear- ing the commandments of the Lord, they did all things contrary.
<br>And when the Lord raised them up judges, in their days, he was moved to mercy, and heard the groanings of the afflicted, and delivered them from the slaughter of the oppressors.
<br>But after the judge was dead, they re- turned, and did much worse things than their fathers had done, following strange gods, serv- ing them, and adoring them. They left not their own inventions, and the stubborn way, by which they were accustomed to walk.
<br>And the wrath of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he said: Behold this nation hath made void my covenant, which I had made with their fathers, and hath despised to hearken to my voice:
<br>I also will not destroy the nations which Josue left when he died:
<br>That through them I may try Israel, whether they will keep the way of the Lord, and walk in it, as their fathers kept it, or not.
<br>The Lord therefore left all these nations, and would not quickly destroy them, neither did he deliver them into the hands of Josue.
<br>
<br>Chapter 3
<br>These are the nations which the Lord left, that by them he might instruct Israel, and all that had not known the wars of the Chanaanites:
<br>That afterwards their children might learn to fight with their enemies, and to be trained up to war:
<br>The five princes of the Philistines, and all the Chanaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hevites
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>that dwelt in Mount Libanus, from Mount Baal Hermon to the entering into Emath.
<br>And he left them, that he might try Israel by them, whether they would hear the command- ments of the Lord, which he had commanded their fathers, by the hand of Moses, or not.
<br>So the children of Israel dwelt in the midst of the Chanaanite, and the Hethite, and the Am- orrhite, and the Pherezite, and the Hevite, and the Jebusite:
<br>And they took their daughters to wives, and they gave their own daughters to their sons, and they served their gods.
<br>And they did evil in the sight of the Lord, and they forgot their God, and served Baalim and Astaroth.
<br>And the Lord being angry with Israel, deliv- ered them into the hands of Chusan Rasathaim, king of Mesopotamia, and they served him eight years.
<br>And they cried to the Lord, who raised them up a saviour, and delivered them; to wit, Oth- oniel, the son of Cenez, the younger brother of Caleb:
<br>And the spirit of the Lord was in him, and he judged Israel. And he went out to fight, and the Lord delivered Chusan Rasathaim, king of Syria, and he overthrew him:
<br>And the land rested forty years, and Oth- oniel, the son of Cenez, died.
<br>And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord: who strengthened against them Eglon, king of Moab: because they did evil in his sight.
<br>And he joined to him the children of Am- mon, and Amalec: and he went and overthrew Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.
<br>And the children of Israel served Eglon, king of Moab, eighteen years.
<br>And afterwards they cried to the Lord, who
<br> 
<br>raised them up a saviour, called Aod, the son of Cera, the son of Jemini, who used the left hand as well as the right. And the children of Israel sent presents to Eglon, king of Moab, by him.
<br>And he made himself a two-edged sword, with a haft in the midst of the length of the palm of the hand, and was girded therewith, under his garment, on the right thigh.
<br>And he presented the gifts to Eglon, king of Moab Now Eglon was exceeding fat.
<br>And when he had presented the gifts unto him he followed his companions that came along with him.
<br>Then returning from Galgal, where the idols were, he said to the king: I have a secret message to thee, O king. And he commanded silence: and all being gone out that were about him,
<br>Aod went in to him: now he was sitting in a summer parlour alone, and he said: I have a word from God to thee. And he forthwith rose up from his throne.
<br>And Aod put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly,
<br>With such force that the haft went in after the blade into the wound, and was closed up with the abundance of fat. So that he did not draw out the dagger, but left it in the body as he had struck it in: and forthwith, by the secret parts of nature, the excrements of the belly came out. 23 And Aod carefully shutting the doors of
<br>the parlour, and locking them,
<br>Went out by a postern door. And the king’s servants going in, saw the doors of the parlour shut, and they said: Perhaps he is easing nature in his summer parlour.
<br>And waiting a long time, till they were ashamed, and seeing that no man opened the door, they took a key: and opening, they found
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>their lord lying dead on the ground.
<br>But Aod, while they were in confusion, escaped, and passed by the place of the idols from whence he had returned. And he came to Seirath:
<br>And forthwith he sounded the trumpet in Mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel went down with him, he himself going in the front.
<br>And he said to them: Follow me: for the Lord hath delivered our enemies, the Moabites, into our hands. And they went down after him, and seized upon the fords of the Jordan, which are in the way to Moab: and they suffered no man to pass over:
<br>But they slew of the Moabites at that time, about ten thousand, all strong and valiant men: none of them could escape.
<br>And Moab was humbled that day under the hand of Israel: and the land rested eighty years.
<br>After him was Samgar, the son of Anath, who slew of the Philistines six hundred men with a ploughshare: and he also defended Israel.
<br>
<br>Chapter 4
<br>And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the Lord after the death of Aod:
<br>2 And the Lord delivered them up into the hands of Jabin, king of Chanaan, who reigned in Asor: and he had a general of his army named Sisara, and he dwelt in Haroseth of the Gentiles. 3 And the children of Israel cried to the Lord: for he had nine hundred chariots set with scythes and for twenty years had grievously oppressed
<br>them.
<br>4 And there was at that time Debbora, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, who judged the people.
<br> 
<br>And she sat under a palm tree, which was called by her name, between Rama and Bethel, in Mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for all judgment.
<br>And she sent and called Barac, the Son of Abinoem, out of Cedes, in Nephthali: and she said to him: The Lord God of Israel hath com- manded thee: Go, and lead an army to Mount Thabor, and thou shalt take with thee ten thou- sand fighting men of the children of Nephthali, and of the children of Zabulon:
<br>And I will bring unto thee in the place of the torrent Cison, Sisara, the general of Jabin’s army, and his chariots, and all his multitude, and will deliver them into thy hand.
<br>And Barac said to her: If thou wilt come with me, I will go: if thou wilt not come with me, I will not go.
<br>She said to him: I will go, indeed, with thee, but at this time the victory shall not be attributed to thee, because Sisara shall be deliv- ered into the hand of a woman. Debbora there- fore arose, and went with Barac to Cedes.
<br>And he called unto him Zabulon and Neph- thali, and went up with ten thousand fighting men, having Debbora in his company.
<br>Now Haber, the Cinite, had some time be- fore departed from the rest of the Cinites, his brethren, the sons of Hobab, the kinsman of Moses: and had pitched his tents unto the valley, which is called Sennim, and was near Cedes.
<br>And it was told Sisara, that Barac, the son of Abinoem, was gone up to Mount Thabor:
<br>And he gathered together his nine hundred chariots armed with scythes, and all his army, from Haroseth of the Gentiles, to the torrent Ci- son.
<br>And Debbora said to Barac: Arise, for this is the day wherein the Lord hath delivered Sisara into thy hands: behold, he is thy leader. And
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Barac went down from Mount Thabor, and ten thousand fighting men with him.
<br>And the Lord struck a terror into Sisara, and all his chariots, and all his multitude, with the edge of the sword, at the sight of Barac; in- somuch, that Sisara leaping down from off his chariot, fled away on foot,
<br>And Barac pursued after the fleeing chari- ots, and the army, unto Haroseth of the Gentiles; and all the multitude of the enemies was utterly destroyed.
<br>But Sisara fleeing, came to the tent of Ja- hel, the wife of Haber, the Cinite, for there was peace between Jabin, the king of Asor, and the house of Haber, the Cinite.
<br>And Jahel went forth to meet Sisara, and said to him: Come in to me, my lord; come in, fear not. He went into her tent, and being cov- ered by her with a cloak,
<br>Said to her: Give me, I beseech thee, a little water, for I am very thirsty. She opened a bottle of milk, and gave him to drink, and covered him. 20 And Sisara said to her: Stand before the door of the tent, and when any shall come and inquire of thee, saying: Is there any man here?
<br>thou shalt say: There is none.
<br>So Jahel, Haber’s wife, took a nail of the tent, and taking also a hammer: and going in softly, and with silence, she put the nail upon the temples of his head, and striking it with the hammer, drove it through his brain fast into the ground: and so passing from deep sleep to death, he fainted away and died.
<br>And behold, Barac came pursuing after Sis- ara: and Jahel went out to meet him, and said to him: Come, and I will shew thee the man whom thou seekest. And when he came into her tent, he saw Sisara lying dead, and the nail fastened in his temples.
<br>So God that day humbled Jabin, the king
<br> 
<br>of Chanaan, before the children of Israel:
<br>Who   grew   daily   stronger,   and   with a mighty hand overpowered Jabin, king of Chanaan, till they quite destroyed him.
<br>
<br>Chapter 5
<br>In that day Debbora and Barac, son of Abinoem, sung, and said:
<br>O you of Israel, that have willingly offered your lives to danger, bless the Lord.
<br>Hear, O ye kings, give ear, O ye princes: It is I, it is I, that will sing to the Lord, I will sing to the Lord, the God of Israel.
<br>O Lord, when thou wentest out of Seir, and passedst by the regions of Edom, the earth trem- bled, and the heavens and clouds dropped water. 5 The mountains melted before the face of the Lord, and Sinai before the face of the Lord the
<br>God of Israel.
<br>In the days of Samgar, the son of Anath, in the days of Jahel, the paths rested: and they that went by them, walked through bye-ways.
<br>The valiant men ceased, and rested in Israel: until Debbora arose, a mother arose in Israel.
<br>The Lord chose new wars, and he himself overthrew the gates of the enemies: a shield and spear was not seen among forty thousand of Is- rael.
<br>My heart loveth the princes of Israel: O you, that of your own good will offered yourselves to danger, bless the Lord.
<br>11	Where the chariots were dashed together, and the army of the enemies was choked, there let the justices of the Lord be rehearsed, and his clemency towards the brave men of Israel: then the people of the Lord went down to the gates, and obtained the sovereignty.
<br>12	Arise, arise, O Debbora, arise, arise, and
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>utter a canticle. Arise, Barac, and take hold of thy captives, O son of Abinoem.
<br>13	The remnants of the people are saved, the Lord hath fought among the valiant ones.
<br>14	Out of Ephraim he destroyed them into Amalec, and after him out of Benjamin into thy people, O Amalec: Out of Machir there came down princes, and out of Zabulon they that led the army to fight.
<br>15	The captains of Issachar were with Debb- ora, and followed the steps of Barac, who ex- posed himself to danger, as one going headlong, and into a pit. Ruben being divided against him- self, there was found a strife of courageous men. 16 Why dwellest thou between two borders, that thou mayst hear the bleatings of the flocks?
<br>Ruben being divided against himself, there was found a strife of courageous men.
<br>17	Galaad rested beyond the Jordan, and Dan applied himself to ships: Aser dwelt on the sea shore, and abode in the havens.
<br>18	But Zabulon and Nephthali offered their lives to death in the region of Merome.
<br>19	The kings came and fought, the kings of Chanaan fought in Thanac, by the waters of Mageddo and yet they took no spoils.
<br>20	There was war made against them from heaven: the stars, remaining in their order and courses, fought against Sisara.
<br>21	The torrent of Cison dragged their car- casses, the torrent of Cadumim, the torrent of Cison: tread thou, my soul, upon the strong ones.
<br>22	The hoofs of the horses were broken whilst the stoutest of the enemies fled amain, and fell headlong down.
<br>23	Curse ye the land of Meroz, said the angel of the Lord: curse the inhabitants thereof, be- cause they came not to the help of the Lord, to help his most valiant men.
<br> 
<br>24	Blessed among women be Jahel, the wife of Haber the Cinite, and blessed be she in her tent.
<br>25	He asked her water, and she gave him milk, and offered him butter in a dish fit for princes.
<br>26	She put her left hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workman’s hammer, and she struck Sisara, seeking in his head a place for the wound, and strongly piercing through his tem- ples.
<br>27	Between her feet he fell: he fainted, and he died: he rolled before her feet, and there he lay lifeless and wretched.
<br>28	His mother looked out at a window, and howled: and she spoke from the dining room: Why is his chariot so long in coming back? Why are the feet of his horses so slow?
<br>29	One that was wiser than the rest of his wives, returned this answer to her mother in law: 30 Perhaps he is now dividing the spoils, and the fairest of the women is chosen out for him: garments of divers colours are given to Sisara for his prey, and furniture of different kinds is
<br>heaped together to adorn necks.
<br>31	So let all thy enemies perish, O Lord: but let them that love thee shine, as the sun shineth in his rising.
<br>32	And the land rested for forty years.
<br>
<br>Chapter 6
<br>And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the Lord: and he delivered them into the hand of Madian seven years,
<br>2	And they were grievously oppressed by them. And they made themselves dens and caves in the mountains, and strong holds to resist.
<br>3	And when Israel had sown, Madian and Amalec, and the rest of the eastern nations, came
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>up:
<br>4	And pitching their tents among them, wasted all things as they were in the blade, even to the entrance of Gaza: and they left nothing at all in Israel for sustenance of life, nor sheep, nor oxen, nor asses.
<br>5	For they and all their flocks came with their tents, and like locusts filled all places, an innu- merable multitude of men, and of camels, wast- ing whatsoever they touched.
<br>6	And Israel was humbled exceedingly in the sight of Madian.
<br>7	And he cried to the Lord, desiring help against the Madianites.
<br>8	And he sent unto them a prophet, and he spoke: Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel: I made you to come up out of Egypt, and brought you out of the house of bondage,
<br>9	And delivered you out of the hands of the Egyptians, and of all the enemies that afflicted you: and I cast them out at your coming in, and gave you their land.
<br>10	And I said: I am the Lord your God, fear not the gods of the Amorrhites, in whose land you dwell. And you would not hear my voice.
<br>11	And an angel of the Lord came, and sat under an oak that was in Ephra, and belonged to Joas, the father of the family of Ezri. And when Gedeon, his son, was threshing and cleans- ing wheat by the winepress, to flee from Madian, 12 The angel of the Lord appeared to him, and said: The Lord is with thee, O most valiant
<br>of men.
<br>13	And Gedeon said to him: I beseech thee, my lord, if the Lord be with us, why have these evils fallen upon us? Where are his miracles, which our fathers have told us of, saying: The Lord brought us out of Egypt but now the Lord hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hand of Madian.
<br> 
<br>14	And the Lord looked upon him, and said: Go, in this thy strength, and thou shalt deliver Israel out of the hand of Madian: know that I have sent thee.
<br>15	He answered, and said: I beseech thee, my lord wherewith shall I deliver Israel? Behold, my family is the meanest in Manasses, and I am the least in my father’s house.
<br>16	And the Lord said to him: I will be with thee: and thou shalt cut off Madian as one man. 17 And he said: If I have found grace before thee, give me a sign that it is thou that speakest
<br>to me:
<br>18	And depart not hence, till I return to thee, and bring a sacrifice, and offer it to thee.   And he answered: I will wait thy coming.
<br>19	So Gedeon went in, and boiled a kid, and made unleavened loaves of a measure of flour: and putting the flesh in a basket, and the broth of the flesh into a pot, he carried all under the oak, and presented to him.
<br>20	And the angel of the Lord said to him: Take the flesh and the unleavened loaves, and lay them upon that rock, and pour out the broth thereon. And when he had done so,
<br>21	The angel of the Lord put forth the tip of the rod, which he held in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened loaves: and there arose a fire from the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened loaves: and the angel of the Lord vanished out of his sight.
<br>22	And Gedeon seeing that it was the angel of the Lord, said: Alas, my Lord God: for I have seen the angel of the Lord face to face.
<br>23	And the Lord said to him: Peace be with thee: fear not, thou shalt not die.
<br>24	And Gedeon built there an altar to the Lord, and called it the Lord’s peace, until this present day. And when he was yet in Ephra, which is of the family of Ezri,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>25	That night the Lord said to him: Take a bullock of thy father’s, and another bullock of seven years, and thou shalt destroy the altar of Baal, which is thy father’s: and cut down the grove that is about the altar:
<br>26	And thou shalt build un altar to the Lord thy God, in the top of this rock, whereupon thou didst lay the sacrifice before: and thou shalt take the second bullock, and shalt offer a holocaust upon a pile of the wood, which thou shalt cut down out of the grove.
<br>27	Then Gedeon, taking ten men of his ser- vants, did as the Lord had commanded him. But fearing his father’s house, and the men of that city, he would not do it by day, but did all by night.
<br>28	And when the men of that town were risen in the morning, they saw the altar of Baal de- stroyed, and the grove cut down, and the second bullock laid upon the altar, which then was built. 29 And they said one to another: Who hath done this? And when they inquired for the au- thor of the fact, it was said: Gedeon, the son of
<br>Joas, did all this.
<br>30	And they said to Joas: Bring out thy son hither, that he may die: because he hath de- stroyed the altar of Baal, and hath cut down his grove.
<br>31	He answered them: Are you the avengers of Baal, that you fight for him? he that is his adversary, let him die before to morrow light ap- pear: if he be a god, let him revenge himself on him that hath cast down his altar.
<br>32	From that day Gedeon was called Jerobaal, because Joas had said: Let Baal revenge himself on him that hath cast down his altar.
<br>33	Now all Madian, and Amalec, and the east- ern people, were gathered together, and passing over the Jordan, camped in the valley of Jezrael.
<br>34	But the spirit of the Lord came upon
<br> 
<br>Gedeon, and he sounded the trumpet, and called together the house of Abiezer, to follow him.
<br>35	And he sent messengers into all Manasses, and they also followed him : and other messen- gers into Aser and Zabulon, and Nephthali, and they came to meet him.
<br>36	And Gedeon said to God: If thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as thou hast said,
<br>37	I will put this fleece of wool on the floor: if there be dew in the fleece only, and it be dry on all the ground beside, I shall know that by my hand, as thou hast said, thou wilt deliver Israel.
<br>38	And it was so. And rising before day, wringing the fleece, he filled a vessel with the dew.
<br>39	And he said again to God: Let not thy wrath be kindled against me, if I try once more, seeking a sign in the fleece. I pray that the fleece only may be dry, and all the ground wet with dew.
<br>40	And God did that night as he had re- quested: and it was dry on the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.
<br>
<br>Chapter 7
<br>Then Jerobaal, who is the same as Gedeon, rising up early, and all the people with him, came to the fountain that is called Harad. Now the camp of Madian was in the valley, on the north side of the high hill.
<br>2	And the Lord said to Gedeon: The peo- ple that are with thee are many, and Madian shall not be delivered into their hands: lest Israel should glory against me, and say: I was delivered by my own strength.
<br>3	Speak to the people, and proclaim in the hearing of all: Whosoever is fearful and timo- rous, let him return. So two and twenty thou-
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>sand men went away from Mount Galaad and returned home, and only ten thousand remained. 4 And the Lord said to Gedeon: The people are still too many, bring them to the waters, and there I will try them: and of whom I shall say to thee, This shall go with thee, let him go: whom
<br>I shall forbid to go, let him return.
<br>5	And when the people were come down to the waters, the Lord said to Gedeon: They that shall lap the water with their tongues, as dogs are wont to lap, thou shalt set apart by them- selves: but they that shall drink bowing down their knees, shall be on the other side.
<br>6	And the number of them that had lapped water; casting it with the hand to their mouth, was three hundred men: and all the rest of the multitude had drunk kneeling.
<br>7	And the Lord said to Gedeon: By the three hundred men, that lapped water, I will save you, and deliver Madian into thy hand: but let all the rest of the people return to their place.
<br>8	So taking victuals and trumpets according to their number, he ordered all the rest of the mul- titude to depart to their tents: and he with the three hundred gave himself to the battle. Now the camp of Madia was beneath him in the val- ley.
<br>9	The same night the Lord said to him: Arise, and go down into the camp: because I have de- livered them into thy hand.
<br>10	But if thou be afraid to go alone, let Phara, thy servant, go down with thee.
<br>11	And when thou shalt hear what they are saying, then shall thy hands be strengthened, and thou shalt go down more secure to the ene- mies’ camp. And he went down with Phara his servant, into part of the camp, where was the watch of men in arms.
<br>12	But Madian and Amalec, and all the east- ern people, lay scattered in the valley, as a multi-
<br> 
<br>tude of locusts: their camels also were innumer- able, as the sand that lieth on the sea shore.
<br>13	And when Gedeon was come, one told his neighbour a dream: and in this manner related what he had seen: I dreamt a dream, and it seemed to me as if a hearth cake of barley bread rolled and came down into the camp of Madian: and when it was come to a tent, it struck it, and beat it down flat to the ground.
<br>14	He to whom he spoke, answered: This is nothing else but the sword of Gedeon, the son of Joas, a man of Israel. For the Lord hath deliv- ered Madian, and all their camp into his hand.
<br>15	And when Gedeon had heard the dream, and the interpretation thereof, he adored: and returned to the camp of Israel, and said: Arise, for the Lord hath delivered the camp of Madian into our hands.
<br>16	And he divided the three hundred men into three parts, and gave them trumpets in their hands, and empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers.
<br>17	And he said to them: What you shall see me do, do you the same: I will go into one part of the camp, and do you as I shall do.
<br>18	When the trumpet shall sound in my hand, do you also blow the trumpets on every side of the camp, and shout together to the Lord and to Gedeon.
<br>19	And Gedeon, and the three hundred men that were with him, went into part of the camp, at the beginning of the midnight watch, and the watchmen being alarmed, they began to sound their trumpets, and to clap the pitchers one against another.
<br>20	And when they sounded their trurmpets in three places round about the camp, and had broken their pitchers, they held their lamps in their left hands, and with their right hands the trumpets which they blew, and they cried out:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>The sword of the Lord and of Gedeon:
<br>21	Standing every man in his place round about the enemies’ camp. So all the camp was troubled, and crying out and howling, they fled away:
<br>22	And the three hundred men nevertheless persisted sounding the trumpets. And the Lord sent the sword into all the camp, and they killed one another,
<br>23	Fleeing as far as Bethsetta, and the bor- der of Abelmahula, in Tebbath. But the men of Israel, shouting from Nephthali, and Aser, and from all Manasses, pursued after Madian.
<br>24	And Gedeon sent messengers into all Mount Ephraim, saying: Come down to meet Madian, and take the waters before them to Bethbera and the Jordan. And all Ephraim shouted, and took the waters before them and the Jordan as far as Bethbera.
<br>25	And having taken two men of Madian, Oreb and Zeb: Oreb they slew in the rock of Oreb, and Zeb in the winepress of Zeb. And they pursued Madian, carrying the heads of Oreb and Zeb to Gedeon, beyond the waters of the Jordan.
<br>
<br>Chapter 8
<br>And the men of Ephraim said to him: What is this that thou meanest to do, that thou wouldst not call us, when thou wentest to fight against Madian? And they chid him sharply, and almost offered violence.
<br>2	And he answered them: What could I have done like to that which you have done? Is not one bunch of grapes of Ephraim better than the vintages of Abiezer?
<br>3	The Lord hath delivered into your hands the princes of Madian, Oreb and Zeb: what could I have done like to what you have done? And
<br> 
<br>when he had said this, their spirit was appeased, with which they swelled against him.
<br>4	And when Gedeon was come to the Jordan, he passed over it with the three hundred men that were with him: who were so weary that they could not pursue after them that fled.
<br>5	And he said to the men of Soccoth: Give, I beseech you, bread to the people that is with me, for they are faint: that we may pursue Zebee, and Salmana, the kings of Madian.
<br>6	The princes of Soccoth answered: Perad- venture the palms of the hands of Zebee and Salmana are in thy hand, and therefore thou de- mandest that we should give bread to thy army. 7 And he said to them: When the Lord there- fore shall have delivered Zebee and Salmana into my hands, I will thresh your flesh with the thorns
<br>and briers of the desert.
<br>8	And going up from thence, he came to Phanuel: and he spoke the like things to the men of that place. And they also answered him, as the men of Soccoth had answered.
<br>9	He said, therefore, to them also: When I shall return a conqueror in peace, I will destroy this tower.
<br>10	But Zebee and Salmana were resting with all their army. For fifteen thousand men were left of all the troops of the eastern people, and one hundred and twenty thousand warriors that drew the sword were slain.
<br>11	And Gedeon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents, on the east of Nobe and Jeg- baa, and smote the camp of the enemies, who were secure, and suspected no hurt.
<br>12	And Zebee and Salmana fled, and Gedeon pursued and took them, all their host being put in confusion.
<br>13	And returning from the battle before the sun rising,
<br>14	He took a boy of the men of Soccoth: and
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>he asked him the names of the princes and an- cients of Soccoth, and he described unto him seventy-seven men.
<br>15	And he came to Soccoth, and said to them: Behold Zebee, and Salmana, concerning whom you upbraided me, saying:	Peradventure the hands of Zebee and Salmana are in thy hands, and therefore thou demandest that we should give bread to the men that are weary and faint. 16 So he took the ancients of the city, and thorns and briers of the desert, and tore them with the same, and cut in pieces the men of Soc-
<br>coth.
<br>17	And he demolished the tower of Phanuel, and slew the men of the city.
<br>18	And he said to Zebee and Salmana: What manner of men were they, whom you slew in Thabor? They answered: They were like thee, and one of them as the son of a king.
<br>20	And he said to Jether, his eldest son: Arise, and slay them. But he drew not his sword: for he was afraid, being but yet a boy.
<br>21	And Zebee and Salmana said: Do thou rise and run upon us: because the strength of a man is according to his age: Gedeon rose up, and slew Zebee and Salmana: and he took the ornaments and bosses, with which the necks of the camels of kings are wont to be adorned.
<br>22	And all the men of Israel said to Gedeon: Rule thou over us, and thy son, and thy son’s son: because thou hast delivered us from the hand of Madian.
<br>23	And he said to them: I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you, but the Lord shall rule over you.
<br>24	And he said to them: I desire one request of you: Give me the earlets of your spoils. For the Ismaelites were accustomed to wear golden earlets.
<br>25	They answered: We will give them most
<br> 
<br>willingly. And spreading a mantle on the ground, they cast upon it the earlets of the spoils.
<br>26	And the weight of the earlets that he re- quested, was a thousand seven hundred sicles of gold, besides the ornaments, and jewels, and purple raiment, which the kings of Madian were wont to use, and besides the golden chains that were about the camels necks.
<br>27	And Gedeon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city Ephra. And all Israel commit- ted fornication with it, and it became a ruin to Gedeon, and to all his house.
<br>28	But Madian was humbled before the chil- dren of Israel, neither could they any more lift up their heads: but the land rested for forty years, while Gedeon presided.
<br>29	So Jerobaal, the son of Joas, went and dwelt in his own house:
<br>30	And he had seventy sons, who came out of his thigh, for he had many wives.
<br>31	And his concubine, that he had in Sichem, bore him a son, whose name was Abimelech.
<br>32	And Gedeon, the son of Joas died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father, in Ephra, of the family of Ezri.
<br>33	But after Gedeon was dead, the children of Israel turned again, and committed fornication with Baalim. And they made a covenant with Baal, that he should be their god:
<br>34	And they remembered not the Lord their God, who delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies round about:
<br>35	Neither did they shew mercy to the house of Jerobaal Gedeon, according to all the good things he had done to Israel.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 9
<br>And Abimelech, the son of Jerobaal, went to Sichem, to his mother’s brethren, and spoke to them, and to all the kindred of his mother’s fa- ther, saying:
<br>2	Speak to all the men of Sichem: whether is better for you that seventy men, all the sons of Jerobaal, should rule over you, or that one man should rule over you? And withal, consider that I am your bone, and your flesh.
<br>3	And his mother’s brethren spoke of him to all the men of Sichem, all these words, and they inclined their hearts after Abimelech, saying: He is our brother:
<br>4	And they gave him seventy weight of sil- ver out of the temple of Baalberith: wherewith he hired to himself men that were needy, and vagabonds, and they followed him.
<br>5	And he came to his father’s house in Ephra, and slew his brethren, the sons of Jerobaal, sev- enty men, upon one stone: and there remained only Joatham, the youngest son of Jerobaal, who was hidden.
<br>6	And all the men of Sichem were gathered together, and all the families of the city of Mello: and they went and made Abimelech king, by the oak that stood in Sichem.
<br>7	This being told to Joatham, he went, and stood on the top of Mount Garizim: and lifting up his voice, he cried, and said: Hear me, ye men of Sichem, so may God hear you.
<br>8	The trees went to anoint a king over them: and they said to the olive tree: Reign thou over us.
<br>9	And it answered: Can I leave my fatness, which both gods and men make use of, to come to be promoted among the trees?
<br>10	And the trees said to the fig tree: Come thou and reign over us.
<br> 
<br>11	And it answered them: Can I leave my sweetness, and my delicious fruits, and go to be promoted among the other trees?
<br>12	And the trees said to the vine: Come thou and reign over us.
<br>13	And it answered them: Can I forsake my wine, that cheereth God and men, and be pro- moted among the other trees?
<br>14	And all the trees said to the bramble: Come thou and reign over us.
<br>15	And it answered them: If, indeed, you mean to make me king, come ye, and rest under my shadow: but if you mean it not, let fire come out from the bramble, and devour the cedars of Libanus.
<br>16	Now, therefore, if you have done well, and without sin, in appointing Abimelech king over you, and have dealt well with Jerobaal, and with his house, and have made a suitable return for the benefits of him who fought for you,
<br>17	And exposed his life to dangers, to deliver you from the hand of Madian,
<br>18	And you are now risen up against my fa- ther’s house, and have killed his sons, seventy men, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his handmaid, king over the inhabi- tants of Sichem, because he is your brother:
<br>19	If therefore you have dealt well, and with- out fault, with Jerobaal and his house, rejoice ye, this day, in Abimelech, and may he rejoice in you.
<br>20	But if unjustly: let fire come out from him, and consume the inhabitants of Sichem, and the town of Mello: and let fire come out from the men of Sichem and from the town of Mello, and devour Abimelech.
<br>21	And when he had said thus, he fled, and went into Bera: and dwelt there for fear of Abim- elech, his brother.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>22	So Abimelech reigned over Israel three years.
<br>23	And the Lord sent a very evil spirit between Abimelech and the inhabitants of Sichem; who began to detest him,
<br>24	And to lay the crime of the murder of the seventy sons of Jerobaal, and the shedding of their blood, upon Abimelech, their brother, and upon the rest of the princes of the Sichemites, who aided him.
<br>25	And they set an ambush against him on the top of the mountains: and while they waited for his coming, they committed robberies, tak- ing spoils of all that passed by: and it was told Abimelech.
<br>26	And Gaal, the son of Obed, came with his brethren, and went over to Sichem. And the in- habitants of Sichem, taking courage at his com- ing,
<br>27	Went out into the fields, wasting the vineyards, and treading down the grapes: and singing and dancing, they went into the temple of their god, and in their banquets and cups they cursed Abimelech.
<br>28	And Gaal, the son of Obed, cried: Who is Abimelech, and what is Sichem, that we should serve him? Is he not the son of Jerobaal, and hath made Zebul, his servant, ruler over the men of Emor, the father of Sichem? Why then shall we serve him?
<br>29	Would to God that some man would put this people under my hand, that I might remove Abimelech out of the way. And it was said to Abimelech: Gather together the multitude of an army, and come.
<br>30	For Zebul, the ruler of the city, hearing the words of Gaal, the son of Obed, was very angry, 31 And sent messengers privately to Abim- elech, saying: Behold, Gaal, the son of Obed, is come into Sichem with his brethren, and endeav-
<br> 
<br>oureth to set the city against thee.
<br>32	Arise, therefore, in the night, with the peo- ple that is with thee, and lie hid in the field:
<br>33	And betimes in the morning, at sun rising, set upon the city, and when he shall come out against thee, with his people, do to him what thou shalt be able.
<br>34	Abimelech, therefore, arose with all his army, by night, and laid ambushes near Sichem in four places.
<br>35	And Gaal, the son of Obed, went out, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city. And Abimelech rose up, and all his army with him, from the places of the ambushes.
<br>36	And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul: Behold, a multitude cometh down from the mountains. And he answered him: Thou seest the shadows of the mountains as if they were the heads of men, and this is thy mistake.
<br>37	Again Gaal said: Behold, there cometh people down from the midst of the land, and one troop cometh by the way that looketh towards the oak.
<br>38	And Zebul said to him: Where is now thy mouth, wherewith thou saidst: Who is Abim- elech, that we should serve him? Is not this the people which thou didst despise? Go out, and fight against him.
<br>39	So Gaal went out, in the sight of the people of Sichem, and fought against Abimelech,
<br>40	Who chased and put him to flight, and drove him to the city: and many were slain of his people, even to the gate of the city:
<br>41	And Abimelech sat down in Ruma: but Zebul drove Gaal, and his companions, out of the city, and would not suffer them to abide in it.
<br>42	So the day following the people went out into the field. And it was told to Abimelech,
<br>43	And he took his army, and divided it into
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>three companies, and laid ambushes in the fields. And seeing that the people came out of the city, he arose, and set upon them,
<br>44	With his own company, assaulting and be- sieging the city: whilst the two other companies chased the enemies that were scattered about the field.
<br>45	And Abimelech assaulted the city all that day: and took it, and killed the inhabitants thereof, and demolished it, so that he sowed salt in it.
<br>46	And when they who dwelt in the tower of Sichem, had  heard this, they went  into the temple of their god Berith, where they had made a covenant with him, and from thence the place had taken its name, and it was exceeding strong. 47 Abimelech also hearing that the men of the
<br>tower of Sichem were gathered together,
<br>48	Went up into mount Selmon, he and all his people with him: and taking an axe, he cut down the bough of a tree, and laying it on his shoulder, and carrying it, he said to his companions: What you see me do, do ye out of hand.
<br>49	So they cut down boughs from the trees, every man as fast as he could, and followed their leader. And surrounding the fort, they set it on fire: and so it came to pass, that with the smoke and with the fire a thousand persons were killed, men and women together, of the inhabitants of the town of Sichem.
<br>50	Then Abimelech, departing from thence, came to the town of Thebes, which he sur- rounded and besieged with his army.
<br>51	And there was in the midst of the city a high tower, to which both the men and the women were fled together, and all the princes of the city, and having shut and strongly barred the gate, they stood upon the battlements of the tower to defend themselves.
<br>52	And Abimelech, coming near the tower,
<br> 
<br>fought stoutly: and, approaching to the gate, endeavoured to set fire to it:
<br>53	And behold, a certain woman casting a piece of a millstone from above, dashed it against the head of Abimelech, and broke his skull.
<br>54	And he called hastily to his armourbearer, and said to him: Draw thy sword, and kill me: lest it should be said that I was slain by a woman. He did as he was commanded, and slew him.
<br>55	And when he was dead all the men of Israel that were with him, returned to their homes.
<br>56	And God repaid the evil that Abimelech had done against his father, killing his seventy brethren.
<br>57	The Sichemites also were rewarded for what they had done, and the curse of Joatham, the son of Jerobaal, came upon them.
<br>
<br>Chapter 10
<br>After Abimelech, there arose a ruler in Israel, Thola, son of Phua, the uncle of Abimelech, a man of Issachar, who dwelt in Samir of mount Ephraim:
<br>2	And he judged Israel three and twenty years, and he died, and was buried in Samir.
<br>3	To him succeeded Jair, the Galaadite, who judged Israel for two and twenty years,
<br>4	Having thirty sons, that rode on thirty ass colts, and were princes of thirty cities, which from his name were called Havoth Jair, that is, the towns of Jair, until this present day, in the land of Galaad.
<br>5	And Jair died, and was buried in the place which is called Camon.
<br>6	But the children of Israel, adding new sins to their old ones, did evil in the sight of the Lord, and served idols, Baalim and Astaroth, and the gods of Syria, and of Sidon, and of Moab, and of
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines: and they left the Lord, and did not serve him.
<br>7	And the Lord being angry with them, deliv- ered them into the hands of the Philistines, and of the children of Ammon.
<br>8	And they were afflicted, and grievously op- pressed for eighteen years, all they that dwelt beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorrhite, who is in Galaad:
<br>9	Insomuch that the children of Ammon, pass- ing over the Jordan, wasted Juda, and Benjamin, and Ephraim: and Israel was distressed exceed- ingly.
<br>10	And they cried to the Lord, and said, We have sinned against thee, because we have for- saken the Lord our God, and have served Baalim. 11 And the Lord said to them: Did not the Egyptians, and the Amorrhites, and the children
<br>of Ammon, and the Philistines,
<br>12	The Sidonians also, and Amalec, and Chanaan, oppress you, and you cried to me, and I delivered you out of their hand?
<br>13	And yet you have forsaken me, and have worshipped strange gods: therefore I will deliver you no more:
<br>14	Go, and call upon the gods which you have chosen: let them deliver you in the time of dis- tress.
<br>15	And the children of Israel said to the Lord: We have sinned, do thou unto us whatsoever pleaseth thee: only deliver us this time.
<br>16	And saying these things, they cast away out of their coasts all the idols of strange gods, and served the Lord their God: and he was touched with their miseries.
<br>17	And the children of Ammon shouting to- gether, pitched their tents in Galaad: against whom the children of Israel assembled them- selves together, and camped in Maspha.
<br> 
<br>18	And the princes of Galaad said one to an- other: Whosoever of us shall first begin to fight against the children of Ammon, he shall be the leader of the people of Galaad.
<br>
<br>Chapter 11
<br>There was at that time Jephte, the Galaadite, a most valiant man,  and a warrior,  the son of a woman that was a harlot, and his father was Galaad.
<br>2	Now Galaad had a wife of whom he had sons: who, after they were grown up, thrust out Jephte, saying: Thou canst not inherit in the house of our father, because thou art born of another mother.
<br>3	Then he fled and avoided them, and dwelt in the land of Tob: and there were gathered to him needy men and robbers, and they followed him as their prince.
<br>4	In those days the children of Ammon made war against Israel.
<br>5	And as they pressed hard upon them, the ancients of Galaad went to fetch Jephte out of the land of Tob to help them:
<br>6	And they said to him: Come thou, and be our prince, and fight against the children of Am- mon.
<br>7	And he answered them: Are not you the men that hated me, and cast me out of my father’s house, and now you are come to me, constrained by necessity?
<br>8	And the princes of Galaad said to Jephte: For this cause we are now come to thee, that thou mayst go with us, and fight against the children of Ammon, and be head over all the inhabitants of Galaad.
<br>9	Jephte also said to them: If you be come to me sincerely, that I should fight for you against
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>the children of Ammon, and the Lord shall de- liver them into my hand, shall I be your prince?
<br>10	They answered him: The Lord, who heareth these things, he himself is mediator and witness that we will do as we have promised.
<br>11	Jephte therefore went with the princes of Galaad, and all the people made him their prince. And Jephte spoke all his words before the Lord in Maspha.
<br>12	And he sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon, to say in his name: What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come against me, to waste my land?
<br>13	And he answered them: Because Israel took away my land, when he came up out of Egypt, from the confines of the Arnon unto the Jaboc and the Jordan: now, therefore, restore the same peaceably to me.
<br>14	And Jephte again sent word by them, and commanded them to say to the king of Ammon: 15 Thus saith Jephte: Israel did not take away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of
<br>Ammon:
<br>16	But when they came up out of Egypt, he walked through the desert to the Red Sea, and came into Cades.
<br>17	And he sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying: Suffer me to pass through thy land. But he would not condescend to his re- quest. He sent also to the king of Moab, who, likewise, refused to give him passage. He abode, therefore, in Cades,
<br>18	And went round the land of Edom at the side, and the land of Moab: and came over against the east coast of the land of Moab, and camped on the other side of the Arnon: and he would not enter the bounds of Moab.
<br>19	So Israel sent messengers to Sehon, king of the Amorrhites, who dwelt in Hesebon, and they said to him: Suffer me to pass through thy land
<br> 
<br>to the river.
<br>20	But he, also despising the words of Israel, suffered him not to pass through his borders: but gathering an infinite multitude, went out against him to Jasa, and made strong opposition.
<br>21	And the Lord delivered him, with all his army, into the hands of Israel, and he slew him, and possessed all the land of the Amorrhite, the inhabitant of that country,
<br>22	And all the coasts thereof from the Arnon to the Jaboc, and from the wilderness to the Jor- dan.
<br>23	So the Lord, the God of Israel, destroyed the Amorrhite, his people of Israel fighting against him, and wilt thou now possess his land?
<br>24	Are not those things which thy god Chamos possesseth, due to thee by right? But what the Lord our God hath obtained by con- quest, shall be our possession:
<br>25	Unless, perhaps, thou art better than Balac, the son of Sephor, king of Moab: or canst shew that he strove against Israel, and fought against him,
<br>26	Whereas he hath dwelt in Hesebon, and the villages thereof, and in Aroer, and its villages, and in all the cities near the Jordan, for three hundred years. Why have you for so long a time attempted nothing about this claim?
<br>27	Therefore I do not trespass against thee, but thou wrongest me by declaring an unjust war against me. The Lord be judge, and decide this day, between Israel and the children of Ammon. 28 And the king of the children of Ammon would not hearken to the words of Jephte, which
<br>he sent him by the messengers.
<br>29	Therefore the spirit of the Lord came upon Jephte, and going round Galaad, and Manasses, and Maspha of Galaad, and passing over from thence to the children of Ammon,
<br>30	He made a vow to the Lord, saying: If
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>thou wilt deliver the children of Ammon into my hands,
<br>31	Whosoever shall first come forth out of the doors of my house, and shall meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, the same will I offer a holocaust to the Lord.
<br>32	And Jephte passed over to the children of Ammon to fight against them: and the Lord de- livered them into his hands.
<br>33	And he smote them from Aroer till you come to Mennith, twenty cities, and as far as Abel, which is set with vineyards, with a very great slaughter: and the children of Ammon were humbled by the children of Israel.
<br>34	And when Jephte returned into Maspha, to his house, his only daughter met him with timbrels and with dances: for he had no other children.
<br>35	And when he saw her, he rent his garments, and said: Alas! my daughter, thou hast deceived me, and thou thyself art deceived: for I have opened my mouth to the Lord, and I can do no other thing.
<br>36	And she answered him: My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth to the Lord, do unto me whatsoever thou hast promised, since the victory hath been granted to thee, and revenge of thy enemies.
<br>37	And she said to her father: Grant me only this, which I desire: Let me go, that I may go about the mountains for two months, and may bewail my virginity with my companions.
<br>38	And he answered her: Go. And he sent her away for two months. And when she was gone with her comrades and companions, she mourned her virginity in the mountains.
<br>39	And the two months being expired, she re- turned to her father, and he did to her as he had vowed, and she knew no man. From thence came a fashion in Israel, and a custom has been kept:
<br> 
<br>40	That, from year to year, the daughters of Israel assemble together, and lament the daugh- ter of Jephte the Galaadite, for four days.
<br>
<br>Chapter 12
<br>But behold there arose a sedition in Ephraim. And passing towards the north, they said to Jephte: When thou wentest to fight against the children of Ammon, why wouldst thou not call us, that we might go with thee? Therefore we will burn thy house.
<br>2	And he answered them: I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon: and I called you to assist me, and you would not do it.
<br>3	And when I saw this,  I put my life in my own hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon and the Lord delivered them into my hands. What have I deserved, that you should rise up to fight against me?
<br>4	Then calling to him all the men of Galaad, he fought against Ephraim: and the men of Galaad defeated Ephraim, because he had said: Galaad is a fugitive of Ephraim, and dwelleth in the midst of Ephraim and Manasses.
<br>5	And the Galaadites secured the fords of the Jordan, by which Ephraim was to return. And when any one of the number of Ephraim came thither in the flight, and said: I beseech you let me pass: the Galaadites said to him: Art thou not an Ephraimite? If he said: I am not:
<br>6	They asked him: Say then, Scibboleth, which is interpreted, An ear of corn. But he an- swered, Sibboleth, not being able to express an ear of corn by the same letter. Then presently they took him and killed him in the very pas- sage of the Jordan. And there fell at that time of Ephraim, two and forty thousand.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>7	And Jephte, the Galaadite, judged Israel six years: and he died, and was buried in his city of Galaad.
<br>8	After him Abesan of Bethlehem judged Is- rael:
<br>9	He had thirty sons, and as many daughters, whom he sent abroad, and gave to husbands, and took wives for his sons, of the same number, bringing them into his house. And he judged Israel seven years:
<br>10	And he died, and was buried in Bethlehem.
<br>11	To him succeeded Ahialon, a Zabulonite: and he judged Israel ten years:
<br>12	And he died, and was buried in Zabulon.
<br>13	After him, Abdon, the son of Illel, a Pharathonite, judged Israel:
<br>14	And he had forty sons, and of them thirty grandsons, mounted upon seventy ass colts, and he judged Israel eight years:
<br>15	And he died, and was buried in Pharathon, in the land of Ephraim, in the mount of Amalech.
<br>
<br>Chapter 13
<br>
<br>And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord: and he delivered them into the hands of the Philistines forty years.
<br>2	Now there was a certain man of Saraa, and of the race of Dan, whose name was Manue, and his wife was barren.
<br>3	And an angel of the Lord appeared to her, and said: Thou art barren and without children: but thou shalt conceive and bear a son.
<br>4	Now therefore beware, and drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing. 6 Because thou shalt conceive, and bear a son, and no razor shall touch his head: for he shall be a Nazarite of God, from his infancy, and from
<br> 
<br>his mother’s womb, and he shall begin to deliver Israel from the hands of the Philistines.
<br>6	And when she was come to her husband, she said to him: A man of God came to me, having the countenance of an angel, very awful. And when I asked him whence he came, and by what name he was called, he would not tell me:
<br>7	But he answered thus: Behold thou shalt conceive and bear a son: beware thou drink no wine, nor strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing: for the child shall be a Nazarite of God from his infancy, from his mother’s womb until the day of his death.
<br>8	Then Manue prayed to the Lord, and said: I beseech thee, O Lord, that the man of God, whom thou didst send, may come again, and teach us what we ought to do concerning the child, that shall be born.
<br>9	And the Lord heard the prayer of Manue, and the angel of the Lord appeared again to his wife, as she was sitting in the field. But Manue her husband was not with her. And when she saw the angel,
<br>10	She made haste, and ran to her husband: and told him, saying: Behold the man hath ap- peared to me, whom I saw before.
<br>11	He rose up, and followed his wife: and com- ing to the man, said to him: Art thou he that spoke to the woman? And he answered: I am.
<br>12	And Manue said to him: When thy word shall come to pass, what wilt thou that the child should do? or from what shall he keep himself? 13 And the angel of the Lord said to Manue: From all the things I have spoken of to thy wife,
<br>let her refrain herself:
<br>14	And let her eat nothing that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing: and whatso- ever I have commanded her, let her fulfil and observe.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>15	And Manue said to the angel of the Lord: I beseech thee to consent to my request, and let us dress a kid for thee.
<br>16	And the angel answered him: If thou press me I will not eat of thy bread: but if thou wilt of- fer a holocaust, offer it to the Lord. And Manue knew not it was the angel of the Lord.
<br>17	And he said to him: What is thy name, that, if thy word shall come to pass, we may honour thee?
<br>18	And he answered him: Why askest thou my name, which is wonderful?
<br>19	Then Manue took a kid of the flocks, and the libations, and put them upon a rock, offering to the Lord, who doth wonderful things: and he and his wife looked on.
<br>20	And when the flame from the altar went up towards heaven, the angel of the Lord ascended also in the same. And when Manue and his wife saw this, they fell flat on the ground;
<br>21	And the angel of the Lord appeared to them no more. And forthwith Manue under- stood that it was an angel of the Lord,
<br>22	And he said to his wife: We shall certainly die, because we have seen God.
<br>23	And his wife answered him: If the Lord had a mind to kill us, he would not have received a holocaust and libations at our hands; neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor have told us the things that are to come.
<br>24	And she bore a son, and called his name Samson. And the child grew, and the Lord blessed him.
<br>25	And the Spirit of the Lord began to be with him in the camp of Dan, between Saraa and Esthaol.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 14
<br>Then Samson went down to Thamnatha, and seeing there a woman of the daughters of the Philistines,
<br>2	He came up, and told his father and his mother, saying: I saw a woman in Thamnatha of the daughters of the Philistines: I bescech you, take her for me to wife.
<br>3	And his father and mother said to him: Is there no woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou wilt take a wife of the Philistines, who are uncircum- cised? And Samson said to his father: Take this woman for me; for she hath pleased my eyes.
<br>4	Now his parents knew not that the thing was done by the Lord, and that he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.
<br>5	Then Samson went down with his father and mother to Thamnatha. And when they were come to the vineyards of the town, behold a young lion met him, raging and roaring.
<br>6	And the Spirit of the Lord came upon Sam- son, and he tore the lion as he would have torn a kid in pieces, having nothing at all in his hand: and he would not tell this to his father and mother.
<br>7	And he went down, and spoke to the woman that had pleased his eyes.
<br>8	And after some days, returning to take her, he went aside to see the carcass of the lion, and behold there was a swarm of bees in the mouth of the lion, and a honey-comb.
<br>9	And when he had taken it in his hands, he went on eating: and coming to his father and mother, he gave them of it, and they ate: but he would not tell them that he had taken the honey from the body of the lion.
<br>11 And when the citizens of that place saw
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>him, they brought him thirty companions to be with him.
<br>12	And Samson said to them: I will propose to you a riddle, which if you declare unto me within the seven days of the feast, I will give you thirty shirts, and as many coats:
<br>13	But if you shall not be able to declare it, you shall give me thirty shirts and the same num- ber of coats. They answered him: Put forth the riddle, that we may hear it.
<br>14	And he said to them: Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not for three days expound the riddle.
<br>15	And when the seventh day came, they said to the wife of Samson: Sooth thy husband, and persuade him to tell thee what the riddle meaneth. But if thou wilt not do it, we will burn thee, and thy father’s house. Have you called us to the wedding on purpose to strip us?
<br>16	So she wept before Samson and com- plained, saying: Thou hatest me, and dost not love me: therefore thou wilt not expound to me the riddle, which thou hast proposed to the sons of my people. But he answered: I would not tell it to my father and mother: and how can I tell it to thee?
<br>17	So she wept before him the seven days of the feast: and, at length, on the seventh day, as she was troublesome to him, he expounded it. And she immediately told her countrymen.
<br>18	And they, on the seventh day before the sun went down, said to him: What is sweeter than honey? and what is stronger than a lion? And he said to them: If you had not ploughed with my heifer, you had not found out my riddle. 19 And the Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he went down to Ascalon, and slew there thirty men whose garments he took away, and gave to them that had declared the riddle. And
<br> 
<br>being exceeding angry, he went up to his father’s house:
<br>20 But his wife took one of his friends and bridal companions for her husband.
<br>
<br>Chapter 15
<br>And a while after, when the days of the wheat harvest were at hand, Samson came, meaning to visit his wife, and he brought her a kid of the flock. And when he would have gone into her chamber, as usual, her father would not suffer him, saying:
<br>2	I thought thou hadst hated her, and there- fore I gave her to thy friend: but she hath a sister, who is younger and fairer than she, take her to wife instead of her.
<br>3	And Samson answered him: From this day I shall be blameless in what I do against the Philistines: for I will do you evils.
<br>4	And he went and caught three hundred foxes, and coupled them tail to tail, and fastened torches between the tails:
<br>6 And setting them on fire he let the foxes go, that they might run about hither and thither. And they presently went into the standing corn of the Philistines. Which being set on fire, both the corn that was already carried together, and that which was yet standing, was all burnt, inso- much that the flame consumed also the vineyards and the oliveyards.
<br>6	Then the Philistines said: Who hath done this thing? And it was answered: Samson, the son in law of the Thamnathite, because he took away his wife, and gave her to another, hath done these things. And the Philistines went up and burnt both the woman and her father.
<br>7	But Samson said to them: Although you have done this, yet will I be revenged of you,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>and then I will be quiet.
<br>8	And he made a great slaughter of them, so that in astonishment they laid the calf of the leg upon the thigh. And going down he dwelt in a cavern of the rock Etam.
<br>9	Then the Philistines going up into the land of Juda, camped in the place which afterwards was called Lechi, that is, the Jawbone, where their army was spread abroad.
<br>10	And the men of the tribe of Juda said to them: Why are you come up against us? They answered: We are come to bind Samson, and to pay him for what he hath done against us.
<br>11	Wherefore three thousand men of Juda went down to the cave of the rock Etam, and said to Samson: Knowest thou not that the Philistines rule over us? Why wouldst thou do thus? And he said to them: As they did to me, so have I done to them.
<br>12	And they said to him: We are come to bind thee, and to deliver thee into the hands of the Philistines. And Samson said to them: Swear to me, and promise me that you will not kill me.
<br>13	They said: We will not kill thee: but we will deliver thee up bound. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him from the rock Etam.
<br>14	Now when he was come to the place of the Jawbone, and the Philistines shouting went to meet him, the Spirit of the Lord came strongly upon him: and as flax is wont to be consumed at the approach of fire, so the bands with which he was bound were broken and loosed.
<br>15	And finding a jawbone, even the jawbone of an ass, which lay there, catching it up, he slew therewith a thousand men.
<br>16	And he said: With the jawbone of an ass, with the jaw of the colt of asses, I have destroyed them, and have slain a thousand men.
<br>17	And when he had ended these words,
<br> 
<br>singing, he threw the jawbone out of his hand, and called the name of that place Ramathlechi, which is interpreted the lifting up of the jawbone.
<br>18	And being very thirsty, he cried to the Lord, and said: Thou hast given this very great deliverance and victory into the hand of thy ser- vant: and behold I die for thirst, and shall fall into the hands of the uncircumcised.
<br>19	Then the Lord opened a great tooth in the jaw of the ass and waters issued out of it. And when he had drunk them, he refreshed his spirit, and recovered his strength. Therefore the name of that place was called The Spring of him that invoked from the jawbone, until this present day. 20 And he judged Israel, in the days of the
<br>Philistines, twenty years.
<br>
<br>Chapter 16
<br>He went also into Gaza, and saw there a woman, a harlot, and went in unto her.
<br>2	And when the Philistines had heard this, and it was noised about among them, that Sam- son was come into the city, they surrounded him, setting guards at the gate of the city, and watch- ing there all the night in silence, that in the morning they might kill him as he went out.
<br>3	But Samson slept till midnight, and then rising, he took both the doors of the gate, with the posts thereof and the bolt, and laying them on his shoulders, carried them up to the top of the hill, which looketh towards Hebron.
<br>4	After this he loved a woman, who dwelt in the valley of Sorec, and she was called Dalila.
<br>5	And the princes of the Philistines came to her, and sald: Deceive him, and learn of him wherein his great strength lieth, and how we may be able to overcome him, to bind and afflict him: which if thou shalt do, we will give thee every one
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>of us eleven hundred pieces of silver.
<br>6	And Dalila said to Samson: Tell me, I be- seech thee, wherein thy greatest strength lieth, and what it is, wherewith if thou wert bound, thou couldst not break loose.
<br>7	And Samson answered her: If I shall be bound with seven cords, made of sinews not yet dry, but still moist, I shall be weak like other men.
<br>8	And the princes of the Philistines brought unto her seven cords, such as he spoke of, with which she bound him;
<br>9	Men lying privately in wait with her, and in the chamber, expecting the event of the thing, and she cried out to him: The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And he broke the bands, as a man would break a thread of tow twined with spittle, when it smelleth the fire: so it was not known wherein his strength lay.
<br>10	And Dalila said to him: Behold thou hast mocked me, and hast told me a false thing: but now at least tell me wherewith thou mayest be bound.
<br>11	And he answered her: If I shall be bound with new ropes, that were never in work, I shall be weak and like other men.
<br>12	Dalila bound him again with these, and cried out: The Philistines are upon thee, Sam- son, there being an ambush prepared for him in the chamber. But he broke the bands like threads of webs.
<br>13	And Dalila said to him again: How long dost thou deceive me, and tell me lies? Shew me wherewith thou mayest be bound. And Samson answered her: If thou plattest the seven locks of my head with a lace, and tying them round about a nail, fastenest it in the ground, I shall be weak.
<br>14	And when Dalila had done this, she said to him: The Philistines are upon thee, Samson.
<br> 
<br>And awaking out of his sleep, he drew out the nail with the hairs and the lace.
<br>15	And Dalila said to him: How dost thou say thou lovest me, when thy mind is not with me? Thou hast told me lies these three times, and wouldst not tell me wherein thy greatest strength lieth.
<br>16	And when she pressed him much, and con- tinually hung upon him for many days, giving him no time to rest, his soul fainted away, and was wearied even unto death.
<br>17	Then opening the truth of the thing, he said to her: The razor hath never come upon my head, for I am a Nazarite, that is to say, con- secrated to God from my mother’s womb: If my head be shaven, my strength shall depart from me, and I shall become weak, and shall be like other men.
<br>18	Then seeing that he had discovered to her all his mind, she sent to the princes of the Philistines, saying: Come up this once more, for now he hath opened his heart to me. And they went up, taking with them the money which they had promised.
<br>19	But she made him sleep upon her knees, and lay his head in her bosom. And she called a barber and shaved his seven locks, and began to drive him away, and thrust him from her: for immediately his strength departed from him.
<br>20	And she said: The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And awaking from sleep, he said in his mind: I will go out as I did before, and shake myself, not knowing that the Lord was de- parted from him.
<br>21	Then the Philistines seized upon him, and forthwith pulled out his eyes, and led him bound in chains to Gaza, and shutting him up in prison made him grind.
<br>22	And now his hair began to grow again,
<br>23	And the princes of the Philistines assem-
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>bled together, to offer great sacrifices to Dagon their god, and to make merry, saying: Our god hath delivered our enemy Samson into our hands.
<br>24	And the people also seeing this, praised their god, and said the same: Our god hath de- livered our adversary into our hands, him that destroyed our country, and killed very many.
<br>25	And rejoicing in their feasts, when they had now taken their good cheer, they commanded that Samson should be called, and should play before them. And being brought out of prison, he played before them; and they made him stand between two pillars.
<br>26	And he said to the lad that guided his steps: Suffer me to touch the pillars which sup- port the whole house, and let me lean upon them, and rest a little.
<br>27	Now the house was full of men and women, and all the princes of the Philistines were there. Moreover about three thousand persons of both sexes, from the roof and the higher part of the house, were beholding Samson’s play.
<br>28	But he called upon the Lord, saying: O Lord God remember me, and restore to me now my former strength, O my God, that I may re- venge myself on my enemies, and for the loss of my two eyes I may take one revenge.
<br>29	And laying hold on both the pillars on which the house rested, and holding the one with his right hand, and the other with his left,
<br>30	He said: Let me die with the Philistines. And when he had strongly shook the pillars, the house fell upon all the princes, and the rest of the multitude, that was there: and he killed many more at his death, than he had killed before in his life.
<br>31	And his brethren and all his kindred, going down took his body, and buried it between Saraa and Esthaol, in the buryingplace of his father
<br> 
<br>Manue: and he judged Israel twenty years.
<br>
<br>Chapter 17
<br>There was at that time a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Michas.
<br>2	Who said to his mother: The eleven hundred pieces of silver, which thou hadst put aside for thyself, and concerning which thou didst swear in my hearing, behold I have, and they are with me. And she said to him. Blessed be my son by the Lord.
<br>3	So he restored them to his mother, who said to him: I have consecrated and vowed this silver to the Lord, that my son may receive it at my hand, and make a graven and a molten god; so now I deliver it to thee.
<br>4	And he restored them to his mother: and she took two hundred pieces of silver and gave them to the silversmith, to make of them a graven and a molten God, which was in the house of Michas. 5 And he separated also therein a little temple for the god, and made an ephod, and theraphim, that is to say, a priestly garment, and idols: and he filled the hand of one of his sons, and he be-
<br>came his priest.
<br>6 In those days there was no king in Israel, but every one did that which seemed right to himself. 7 There was also another young man of Beth- lehem Juda, of the kindred thereof: and he was
<br>a Levite, and dwelt there.
<br>8	Now he went out from the city of Bethlehem, and desired to sojourn wheresoever he should find it convenient for him. And when he was come to mount Ephraim, as he was on his jour- ney, and had turned aside a little into the house of Michas,
<br>9	He was asked by him whence he came. And he answered: I am a Levite of Bethlehem Juda,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>and I am going to dwell where I can, and where I shall find a place to my advantage.
<br>10	And Michas said: Stay with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee every year ten pieces of silver, and a double suit of apparel, and thy victuals.
<br>11	He was content, and abode with the man, and was unto him as one of his sons.
<br>12	And Michas filled his hand, and had the young man with him for his priest, saying:
<br>13	Now I know God will do me good, since I have a priest of the race of the Levites.
<br>
<br>Chapter 18
<br>In those days there was no king in Israel, and the tribe of Dan sought them an inheritance to dwell in: for unto that day they had not received their lot among the other tribes.
<br>2	So the children of Dan sent five most valiant men, of their stock and family, from Saraa and Esthaol, to spy out the land, and to view it dili- gently: and they said to them:  Go, and view the land. They went on their way, and when they came to mount Ephraim, they went into the house of Michas, and rested there:
<br>3	And knowing the voice of the young man the Levite, and lodging with him, they said to him: Who brought thee hither? what dost thou here? why wouldst thou come hither?
<br>4	He answered them: Michas hath done such and such things for me, and hath hired me to be his priest.
<br>5	Then they desired him to consult the Lord, that they might know whether their journey should be prosperous, and the thing should have effect.
<br>6	He answered them: Go in peace: the Lord looketh on your way, and the journey that you
<br> 
<br>go.
<br>7	So the five men going on came to Lais: and they saw how the people dwelt therein without any fear, according to the custom of the Sido- nians, secure and easy, having no man at all to oppose them, being very rich, and living sep- arated, at a distance from Sidon and from all men.
<br>8	And they returned to their brethren in Saraa and Esthaol, who asked them what they had done: to whom they answered:
<br>9	Arise, and let us go up to them: for we have seen the land which is exceeding rich and fruitful: neglect not, lose no time: let us go and possess it, there will be no difficulty.
<br>10	We shall come to a people that is secure, into a spacious country, and the Lord will deliver the place to us, in which there is no want of any thing that groweth on the earth.
<br>11	There went therefore of the kindred of Dan, to wit, from Saraa and Esthaol, six hundred men, furnished with arms for war.
<br>12	And going up they lodged in Cariathiarim of Juda: which place from that time is called the camp of Dan, and is behind Cariathiarim.
<br>13	From thence they passed into mount Ephraim. And when they were come to the house of Michas,
<br>14	The five men, that before had been sent to view the land of Lais, said to the rest of their brethren: You know that in these houses there is an ephod and theraphim, and a graven and a molten god: see what you are pleased to do.
<br>15	And when they had turned a little aside, they went into the house of the young man the Levite, who was in the house of Michas: and they saluted him with words of peace.
<br>16	And the six hundred men stood before the door, appointed with their arms.
<br>17	But they that were gone into the house
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>of the young man, went about to take away the graven god, and the ephod, and the theraphim, and the molten god, and the priest stood before the door, the six hundred valiant men waiting not far off.
<br>18	So they that were gone in took away the graven thing, the ephod, and the idols, and the molten god, And the priest said to them: What are you doing?
<br>19	And they said to him: Hold thy peace, and put thy finger on thy mouth, and come with us, that we may have thee for a father, and a priest. Whether is better for thee, to be a priest in the house of one man, or in a tribe and family in Israel?
<br>20	When he heard this, he agreed to their words, and took the ephod, and the idols, and the graven god, and departed with them.
<br>21	And when they were going forward, and had put before them the children and the cattle, and all that was valuable,
<br>22	And were now at a distance from the house of Michas, the men that dwelt in the houses of Michas gathering together followed them,
<br>23	And began to shout out after them. They looked back, and said to Michas: What aileth thee? Why dost thou cry?
<br>24	And he answered: You have taken away my gods which I have made me, and the priest, and all that I have, and do you say: What aileth thee?
<br>25	And the children of Dan said to him: See thou say no more to us, lest men enraged come upon thee, and thou perish with all thy house.
<br>26	And so they went on the journey they had begun. But Michas seeing that they were stronger than he, returned to his house.
<br>27	And the six hundred men took the priest, and the things we spoke of before, and came to Lais, to a people that was quiet and secure, and
<br> 
<br>smote them with the edge of the sword: and the city they burnt with fire,
<br>28	There being no man at all who brought them any succour, because they dwelt far from Sidon, and had no society or business with any man. And the city was in the land of Rohob: and they rebuilt it, and dwelt therein,
<br>29	Calling the name of the city Dan, after the name of their father, who was the son of Israel, which before was called Lais.
<br>30	And they set up to themselves the graven idol, and Jonathan the son of Gersam, the son of Moses, he and his sons were priests in the tribe of Dan, until the day of their captivity.
<br>31	And the idol of Michas remained with them all the time that the house of God was in Silo. In those days there was no king in Israel.
<br>
<br>Chapter 19
<br>There was a certain Levite, who dwelt on the side of mount Ephraim, who took a wife of Bethlehem Juda:
<br>2	And she left him, and returned to her fa- ther’s house in Bethlehem, and abode with him four months.
<br>3	And her husband followed her, willing to be reconciled with her, and to speak kindly to her, and to bring her back with him, having with him a servant and two asses: and she received him, and brought him into her father’s house. And when his father in law had heard this, and had seen him, he met him with joy,
<br>4	And embraced the man. And the son in law tarried in the house of his father in law three days, eating with him and drinking familiarly.
<br>5	But on the fourth day, arising early in the morning, he desired to depart. But his father in law kept him, and said to him: Taste first a little
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>bread, and strengthen thy stomach, and so thou shalt depart.
<br>6	And they sat down together, and ate and drank. And the father of the young woman said to his son in law: I beseech thee to stay here to day, and let us make merry together.
<br>7	But he rising up, began to be for depart- ing. And nevertheless his father in law earnestly pressed him, and made him stay with him.
<br>8	But when morning was come, the Levite pre- pared to go on his journey. And his father in law said to him again: I beseech thee to take a lit- tle meat, and strengthening thyself, till the day be farther advanced, afterwards thou mayest de- part. And they ate together.
<br>9	And the young man arose to set forward with his wife and servant. And his father in law spoke to him again: Consider that the day is declining, and draweth toward evening: tarry with me to day also, and spend the day in mirth, and to morrow thou shalt depart, that thou mayest go into thy house.
<br>10	His son in law would not consent to his words: but forthwith went forward, and came over against Jebus, which by another name is called Jerusalem, leading with him two asses loaden, and his concubine.
<br>11	And now they were come near Jebus, and the day was far spent: and the servant said to his master: Come, I beseech thee, let us turn into the city of the Jebusites, and lodge there.
<br>12	His master answered him: I will not go into the town of another nation, who are not of the children of Israel, but I will pass over to Gabaa:
<br>13	And when I shall come thither, we will lodge there, or at least in the city of Rama.
<br>14	So they passed by Jebus, and went on their journey, and the sun went down upon them when they were by Gabaa, which is in the tribe of Ben- jamin:
<br> 
<br>15	And they turned into it to lodge there.  And when they were come in, they sat in the street of the city, for no man would receive them to lodge. 16 And behold they saw an old man, returning out of the field and from his work in the evening, and he also was of mount Ephraim, and dwelt as a stranger in Gabaa; but the men of that country
<br>were the children of Jemini.
<br>17	And the old man lifting up his eyes, saw the man sitting with his bundles in the street of the city, and said to him: Whence comest thou? and whither goest thou?
<br>18	He answered him: We came out from Beth- lehem Juda, and we are going to our home, which is on the side of mount Ephraim, from whence we went to Bethlehem: and now we go to the house of God, and none will receive us under his roof:
