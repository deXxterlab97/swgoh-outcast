<br>§1004. Rents and royalties
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>Geothermal leases shall provide for—
<br>
<br>(1) a royalty on electricity produced using geothermal resources, other than direct use of geothermal resources, that shall be—
<br>
<br>(A) not less than 1 percent and not more than 2.5 percent of the gross proceeds from the sale of electricity produced from such resources during the first 10 years of production under the lease; and
<br>
<br>(B) not less than 2 and not more than 5 percent of the gross proceeds from the sale of electricity produced from such resources during each year after such 10-year period;
<br>
<br>(2) a royalty on any byproduct that is a mineral specified in the first section of the Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 181), and that is derived from production under the lease, at the rate of the royalty that applies under that Act [30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.] to production of the mineral under a lease under that Act; and
<br>
<br>(3) payment in advance of an annual rental of not less than—
<br>
<br>(A) for each of the 1st through 10th years of the lease—
<br>
<br>(i) in the case of a lease awarded in a noncompetitive lease sale, $1 per acre or fraction thereof; or
<br>
<br>(ii) in the case of a lease awarded in a competitive lease sale, $2 per acre or fraction thereof for the 1st year and $3 per acre or fraction thereof for each of the 2nd through 10th years; and
<br>
<br>(B) for each year after the 10th year of the lease, $5 per acre or fraction thereof; 1
<br>(b) Direct use
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding subsection (a)(1), the Secretary shall establish a schedule of fees, in lieu of royalties for geothermal resources, that a lessee or its affiliate—
<br>
<br>(A) uses for a purpose other than the commercial generation of electricity; and
<br>
<br>(B) does not sell.
<br>(2) Schedule of fees
<br>
<br>The schedule of fees—
<br>
<br>(A) may be based on the quantity or thermal content, or both, of geothermal resources used;
<br>
<br>(B) shall ensure a fair return to the United States for use of the resource; and
<br>
<br>(C) shall encourage development of the resource.
<br>(3) State, tribal, or local governments
<br>
<br>If a State, tribal, or local government is the lessee and uses geothermal resources without sale and for public purposes other than commercial generation of electricity, the Secretary shall charge only a nominal fee for use of the resource.
<br>(4) Final regulation
<br>
<br>In issuing any final regulation establishing a schedule of fees under this subsection, the Secretary shall seek—
<br>
<br>(A) to provide lessees with a simplified administrative system;
<br>
<br>(B) to facilitate development of direct use of geothermal resources; and
<br>
<br>(C) to contribute to sustainable economic development opportunities in the area.
<br>(c) Final regulation establishing royalty rates
<br>
<br>In issuing any final regulation establishing royalty rates under this section, the Secretary shall seek—
<br>
<br>(1) to provide lessees a simplified administrative system;
<br>
<br>(2) to encourage new development; and
<br>
<br>(3) to achieve the same level of royalty revenues over a 10-year period as the regulation in effect on August 8, 2005.
<br>(d) Credits for in-kind payments of electricity
<br>
<br>The Secretary may provide to a lessee a credit against royalties owed under this chapter, in an amount equal to the value of electricity provided under contract to a State or county government that is entitled to a portion of such royalties under section 1019 of this title, section 35 of the Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 191), except as otherwise provided by this section, or section 355 of this title, if—
<br>
<br>(1) the Secretary has approved in advance the contract between the lessee and the State or county government for such in-kind payments;
<br>
<br>(2) the contract establishes a specific methodology to determine the value of such credits; and
<br>
<br>(3) the maximum credit will be equal to the royalty value owed to the State or county that is a party to the contract and the electricity received will serve as the royalty payment from the Federal Government to that entity.
<br>(e) Crediting of rental toward royalty
<br>
<br>Any annual rental under this section that is paid with respect to a lease before the first day of the year for which the annual rental is owed shall be credited to the amount of royalty that is required to be paid under the lease for that year.
<br>(f) Advanced royalties required for cessation of production
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), if, at any time after commercial production under a lease is achieved, production ceases for any reason, the lease shall remain in full force and effect for a period of not more than an aggregate number of 10 years beginning on the date production ceases, if, during the period in which production is ceased, the lessee pays royalties in advance at the monthly average rate at which the royalty was paid during the period of production.
<br>(2) Reduction
<br>
<br>The amount of any production royalty paid for any year shall be reduced (but not below 0) by the amount of any advanced royalties paid under the lease to the extent that the advance royalties have not been used to reduce production royalties for a prior year.
<br>(3) Exceptions
<br>
<br>Paragraph (1) shall not apply if the cessation in production is required or otherwise caused by—
<br>
<br>(A) the Secretary;
<br>
<br>(B) the Secretary of the Air Force;
<br>
<br>(C) the Secretary of the Army;
<br>
<br>(D) the Secretary of the Navy;
<br>
<br>(E) a State or a political subdivision of a State; or
<br>
<br>(F) a force majeure.
<br>(g) Termination of lease for failure to pay rental
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall terminate any lease with respect to which rental is not paid in accordance with this chapter and the terms of the lease under which the rental is required, on the expiration of the 45-day period beginning on the date of the failure to pay the rental.
<br>(2) Notification
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall promptly notify a lessee that has not paid rental required under the lease that the lease will be terminated at the end of the period referred to in paragraph (1).
<br>(3) Reinstatement
<br>
<br>A lease that would otherwise terminate under paragraph (1) shall not terminate under that paragraph if the lessee pays to the Secretary, before the end of the period referred to in paragraph (1), the amount of rental due plus a late fee equal to 10 percent of the amount.

<br>"(c) Near-Term Production Incentive for Existing Leases.—
<br>
<br>"(1) In general.—Notwithstanding section 5(a) of the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 [30 U.S.C. 1004(a)], the royalty required to be paid shall be 50 percent of the amount of the royalty otherwise required, on any lease issued before the date of enactment of this Act [Aug. 8, 2005] that does not convert to new royalty terms under subsection (e)—
<br>
<br>"(A) with respect to commercial production of energy from a facility that begins such production in the 6-year period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act; or
<br>
<br>"(B) on qualified expansion geothermal energy.
<br>
<br>"(2) 4-year application.—Paragraph (1) applies only to new commercial production of energy from a facility in the first 4 years of such production.
<br>
<br>"(d) Definition of Qualified Expansion Geothermal Energy.—In this section [amending this section and section 1019 of this title and enacting provisions set out as a note under this section], the term 'qualified expansion geothermal energy' means geothermal energy produced from a generation facility for which—

<br>"(A) in the case of a lease that meets the requirements of subsection (b) of section 5 of the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 (30 U.S.C. 1004) (as amended by section 223), that royalties be based on the schedule of fees established under that section; and
<br>
<br>"(B) in the case of any other lease, that royalties be computed on a percentage of the gross proceeds from the sale of electricity, at a royalty rate that is expected to yield total royalty payments equivalent to payments that would have been received for comparable production under the royalty rate in effect for the lease before the date of enactment of this subsection.
<br>
<br>"(2) Timing.—A request for a modification under paragraph (1) shall be submitted to the Secretary of the Interior by the date that is not later than—
<br>
<br>"(A) in the case of a lease for direct use, 18 months after the effective date of the schedule of fees established by the Secretary of the Interior under section 5 of the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 (30 U.S.C. 1004); or
<br>
<br>"(B) in the case of any other lease, 18 months after the effective date of the final regulation issued under subsection (a) [amending this section].
<br>
<br>"(3) Application of modification.—If the lessee requests modification of a lease under paragraph (1)—
<br>
<br>"(A) the Secretary of the Interior shall, within 180 days after the receipt of the request for modification, modify the lease to comply with—
<br>
<br>"(i) in the case of a lease for direct use, the schedule of fees established by the Secretary under section 5 of the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 (30 U.S.C. 1004); or
<br>
<br>"(ii) in the case of any other lease, the royalty for the lease established under paragraph (1)(B); and
<br>
<br>"(B) the modification shall apply to any use of geothermal resources to which subsection (a) [amending this section] applies that occurs after the date of the modification.
<br>
<br>"(4) Consultation.—The Secretary of the Interior shall consult with the State and local governments affected by any proposed changes in lease royalty terms under this subsection."

If the Secretary determines on the basis of scientific evidence that the exploration, development, or utilization of the land subject to the geothermal lease application is reasonably likely to result in a significant adverse effect on a significant thermal feature listed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall not issue such geothermal lease. In addition, the Secretary shall withdraw from leasing under the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970, as amended, those lands, or portion thereof, subject to the application for geothermal lease, the exploration, development, or utilization of which is reasonably likely to result, based on the Secretary's determination, in a significant adverse effect on a significant thermal feature listed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.
<br>
<br>"(d) With respect to all geothermal leases issued after the date of enactment of this section [Oct. 18, 1986] the Secretary shall include stipulations in leases necessary to protect significant thermal features listed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section where a determination is made based on scientific evidence that the exploration, development, or utilization of the lands subject to the lease is reasonably likely to adversely affect such significant features. Such stipulations shall include, but are not limited to:
<br>
<br>"(1) requiring the lessee to reinject geothermal fluids into the rock formations from which they originate;
<br>
<br>"(2) requiring the lessee to report annually to the Secretary on its activities;
<br>
<br>"(3) requiring the lessee to continuously monitor geothermal production and injection wells; and
<br>
<br>"(4) requiring the lessee to suspend activity, temporarily or permanently, on the lease if the Secretary determines that ongoing exploration, development, or utilization activities are having a significant adverse effect on significant thermal features listed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section until such time as the significant adverse effect is eliminated.
<br>
<br>"(e) The Secretary of Agriculture shall consider the effects on significant thermal features of those units of the National Park System identified in subsection (a) of this section in determining whether to consent to leasing under the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970, as amended, on national forest or other lands administered by the Department of Agriculture available for leasing under the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970, as amended, including public, withdrawn, and acquired lands.
<br>
<br>"(f) Nothing contained in this section shall affect the ban on leasing under the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970, as amended, with respect to the Island Park Known Geothermal Resources Area, as provided for in Public Law 98–473 (98 Stat. 1837) [see Tables for classification] and Public Law 99–190 (99 Stat. 1267) [see Tables for classification].
<br>
<br>"(g) Except as provided herein, nothing contained in this section shall affect or modify the authorities or responsibilities of the Secretary under the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970, as amended, or any other provision of law.
<br>
<br>"(h) The provisions of this section shall remain in effect until Congress determines otherwise."

If the Secretary of the Interior finds that such development is imminent, or that production from a well heretofore drilled on such lands is imminent, he shall so report to the Attorney General, and the Attorney General is authorized and directed to institute an appropriate proceeding in the United States district court of the district in which such lands are located, to quiet the title of the United States in such resources, and if the court determines that the reservation of minerals to the United States in the lands involved included the geothermal resources, to enjoin their production otherwise than under the terms of this chapter: Provided, That upon an authoritative judicial determination that Federal mineral reservation does not include geothermal resources the duties of the Secretary of the Interior to report and of the Attorney General to institute proceedings, as hereinbefore set forth, shall cease.
