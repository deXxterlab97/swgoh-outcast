A feasibility report shall also include the views of other Federal agencies and non-Federal agencies with regard to the recommended plan, a description of a nonstructural alternative to the recommended plan when such plan does not have significant nonstructural features, and a description of the Federal and non-Federal participation in such plan, and shall demonstrate that States, other non-Federal interests, and Federal agencies have been consulted in the development of the recommended plan. A feasibility report shall include a preliminary analysis of the Federal interest and the costs, benefits, and environmental impacts of the project.
<br>(3) Applicability
<br>
<br>This subsection shall not apply to—
<br>
<br>(A) any study with respect to which a report has been submitted to Congress before November 17, 1986;
<br>
<br>(B) any study for a project, which project is authorized for construction by this Act and is not subject to section 903(b); 1
<br>
<br>(C) any study for a project which does not require specific authorization by Congress in law or otherwise; and
<br>
<br>(D) general studies not intended to lead to recommendation of a specific water resources project.
<br>(4) Feasibility report defined
<br>
<br>In this subsection, the term "feasibility report" means each feasibility report, and any associated environmental impact statement and mitigation plan, prepared by the Corps of Engineers for a water resources project. The term includes a project implementation report prepared under title VI of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (114 Stat. 2680–2694), a general reevaluation report, and a limited reevaluation report.
<br>(b) Federal interest determination
<br>(1) In general
<br>(A) Economically disadvantaged communities
<br>
<br>In preparing a feasibility report under subsection (a) for a study that will benefit an economically disadvantaged community, upon request by the non-Federal interest for the study, the Secretary shall first determine the Federal interest in carrying out the study and the projects that may be proposed in the study.
<br>(B) Other communities
<br>(i) Authorization
<br>
<br>In preparing a feasibility report under subsection (a) for a study that will benefit a covered community, upon request by the non-Federal interest for the study, the Secretary may, with respect to not more than 3 studies in each fiscal year, first determine the Federal interest in carrying out the study and the projects that may be proposed in the study.

<br>
<br>In this subparagraph, the term "covered community" means a community that—
<br>
<br>(I) is not an economically disadvantaged community; and

<br>(B) Cost
<br>
<br>The cost of a determination under paragraph (1) shall not be included for purposes of the maximum Federal cost under section 2282c(a)(2) of this title.
<br>(5) Report to non-Federal interest
<br>
<br>If, based on a determination under paragraph (1), the Secretary determines that a study or project is not in the Federal interest because the project will not result, or is unlikely to result, in a recommended plan that will produce national economic development benefits greater than cost, but may result in a technically sound and environmentally acceptable plan that is otherwise consistent with section 2281 of this title, the Secretary shall issue a report to the non-Federal interest with recommendations on how the non-Federal interest might modify the proposal such that the project could be in the Federal interest and feasible.
<br>(c) Projects not specifically authorized by Congress
