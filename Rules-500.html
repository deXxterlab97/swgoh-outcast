<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>1949 Act
<br>
<br>Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§35, 35a, 206 (May 26, 1906, ch. 2556, §1, 34 Stat. 200; Jan. 28, 1915, ch. 20, §1, 38 Stat. 800; Apr. 21, 1924, ch. 130, §6, 43 Stat. 106; July 30, 1937, ch. 545, §1, 50 Stat. 547; July 11, 1941, ch. 290, §8, 55 Stat. 586; Aug. 18, 1941, ch. 364, §3, 55 Stat. 629).
<br>
<br>Section 35 of title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., has been divided. The provisions of the first sentence of subsection (a) are placed in this section. The proviso of subsection (a) is covered in section 367(b) of this title. Subsection (b) is placed in section 365 of this title. Subsections (c) and (d) are placed in section 367(a) of this title, except that part (3) of subsection (c) is covered by section 366 of this title.
<br>
<br>Section 206 of title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., has been divided. That part dealing with special temporary enlistments is incorporated in this section. That part dealing with temporary appointments of warrant officers is placed in section 302 of this title.
<br>
<br>Certain additional details concerning the two types of enlistments are added; these details were previously covered in Coast Guard Regulations.
<br>
<br>This section makes provision for the enlistment of personnel in the Coast Guard. The first sentence grants the necessary authority to the Secretary, changes existing law in regard to the term of enlistment from "not to exceed four years" to "not to exceed six years", and adds a provision for the enlistment of minors for their minority only, such provision being in accordance with existing law applicable to the Navy. The next three sentences establish and define the two types of enlistments that are now in effect in the Coast Guard, setting forth the basic difference in the two types. The last sentence continues a provision to the effect that original enlistments in the Coast Guard shall be temporary. This section is a combination of existing law and regulations in regard to enlistments, with changes as noted above. See title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §35, and Coast Guard Regulations, sections 531 and 532. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

<br>§2310. Relief of retired enlisted member promoted while on active duty
<br>
<br>Any enlisted member on the retired list recalled to active duty who during such active duty is advanced to a higher grade or rating under a permanent or temporary appointment or promotion shall, upon relief from active duty be advanced on the retired list to the highest grade or rating held while on active duty. In case the appointment or promotion was temporary the advancement on the retired list shall be made only to such grade or rating in which the member served satisfactorily on active duty.

<br>
<br>Said sections have application to officers only, but in accord with the general plan to make as many provisions as possible applicable both to officers and men, it seems highly desirable to provide similarly for enlisted men—a fortiori because there are cases in the Coast Guard in which enlisted men are suffering inequitably because there is no provision for advancing men on the retired list after they have been advanced in rating while serving on active duty after recall from the retired list. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

<br>§2311. Retirement in cases where higher grade or rating has been held
<br>
<br>Any enlisted member who is retired under any provision of section 2304, 2305, 2306, or 2307 of this title shall be retired from active service with the highest grade or rating held by him while on active duty in which, as determined by the Secretary, his performance of duty was satisfactory, but not lower than his permanent grade or rating.

<br>
<br>The requirement that the higher grade or rating be held prior to June 30, 1946, has been eliminated; this seems to be in line with the intent of Congress as expressed in section 303 of the act of June 29, 1948, ch. 708, 62 Stat. 1081. The act of July 24, 1941, 55 Stat. 605, was enacted primarily for application to Navy personnel but it is made applicable to Coast Guard personnel by its own terms (see title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §350j(b)). 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

<br>§2312. Extension of enlistments
<br>
<br>Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, the term of enlistment of any enlisted member may, by voluntary written agreement, be extended and re-extended for a period not exceeding six full years from the date of expiration of the then-existing term of enlistment, and subsequent to such date an enlisted member who so extends his term of enlistment shall receive the same pay and allowances in all respects as though regularly discharged and reenlisted immediately upon expiration of his term of enlistment. However, the total of all such extensions of an enlistment may not exceed six years. No such extension shall operate to deprive the enlisted member concerned, upon discharge at the termination thereof, of any right, privilege, or benefit to which he would have been entitled if his term of enlistment had not been so extended.

<br>Any enlisted member of the Coast Guard in the active service whose term of enlistment expires while he is suffering disease or injury incident to service and not due to misconduct, and who is in need of medical care or hospitalization, may, with his consent, be retained in such service beyond the expiration of his term of enlistment. Any such enlisted member shall be entitled to receive at Government expense medical care or hospitalization and his pay and allowances, including credit for longevity, until he shall have recovered to such extent as would enable him to meet the physical requirements for reenlistment, or until it shall have been ascertained by competent authority of the Coast Guard that the disease or injury is of a character that recovery to such an extent would be impossible. Any enlisted member whose enlistment is so extended shall be subject to forfeitures in the same manner and to the same extent as if his term of enlistment had not expired. Nothing contained in this section shall prevent any enlisted member from being held in the service without his consent under section 2314 of this title.

<br>Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, an enlisted member may be detained in the Coast Guard beyond the term of his enlistment:
<br>
<br>(1) until the first arrival of the vessel on which he is serving at its permanent station, or at a port in a State of the United States or in the District of Columbia; or

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Subsection (a) is new in this form, but the provision contained therein is expressed or implied in numerous statutes relating to the retirement of military personnel.
<br>
<br>A provision defining the next higher grade to that of commissioned warrant officer as lieutenant (junior grade), for purposes of retirement, was added.
<br>
<br>The other provisions of said section are obsolete and are no longer needed.
<br>
<br>Subsection (a) is new, but the provision contained in it is expressed or implied in numerous statutes relating to retirement of military personnel. It is believed desirable to include such a provision to prevent any misconstruction of retirement statutes, even though no change in existing law is intended on the point covered, either by other sections dealing with retirement or by this section.
<br>
<br>Subsection (b) is a codification of the only provision of title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §174, that it is desired to retain, and in addition designated the next higher grade for commissioned warrant officers as lieutenant (junior grade) because the pay of the commissioned warrant officers is the same as for the grade of lieutenant (junior grade) and advancing such officers to the grade of ensign would in some aspects not appear to be a promotion. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

<br>
<br>(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 524, §422; Pub. L. 99–348, title II, §205(b)(10), July 1, 1986, 100 Stat. 700; renumbered §2503, Pub. L. 115–282, title I, §114(b), Dec. 4, 2018, 132 Stat. 4223.)
<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>This provision is desirable because many enlisted men and low-ranking officers may now retire with higher grade which they previously held on a temporary basis. If recalled in the higher grades, they might not be capable of holding same at the time of recall. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

<br>
<br>(4) In the case of an officer whose retired pay is computed on the pay of a grade for which basic pay is not based upon years of service, retired pay under paragraph (1) shall be computed on the basis of the number of years of service for which the officer would be entitled to credit in the computation of pay on the active list had the officer been serving in the grade of captain at the time of retirement.
<br>
<br>(b) The retired pay of a member who first became a member of a uniformed service (as defined in section 101 of title 10) on or after September 8, 1980, is determined by multiplying—
<br>
<br>(1) the retired pay base determined under section 1407 of title 10; by
<br>
<br>(2) the retired pay multiplier determined under section 1409 of title 10 for the number of years of service that may be credited to the member under section 1405 of such title.
<br>
<br>(c)(1) In computing for the purpose of subsection (a) or (b) the number of years of service that may be credited to a member under section 1405 of title 10—
<br>
<br>(A) each full month of service that is in addition to the number of full years of service creditable to the member shall be counted as 1/12 of a year; and
<br>
<br>(B) any remaining fractional part of a month shall be disregarded.
<br>
<br>(2) Retired pay computed under this section, if not a multiple of $1, shall be rounded to the next lower multiple of $1.
<br>
<br>(d) In addition to amounts computed pursuant to subsections (a) through (c) of this section, a full TSP member (as defined in section 8440e(a) of title 5) of the Coast Guard is entitled to continuation pay pursuant to section 356 of title 37.
