<br>

<br>
<br>"(a) The Congress finds and declares that—
<br>
<br>"(1) a strong export policy is essential to the health and well-being of the United States economy;
<br>
<br>"(2) exports of goods and services account for one out of every six jobs in the manufacturing sector and 10 per centum of the gross national product.
<br>
<br>"(3) every billion dollars in new exports is estimated to provide forty thousand jobs;
<br>
<br>"(4) there is increased and fierce competition in international markets to United States goods and services;
<br>
<br>"(5) small businesses account for no more than 10 per centum of all United States export sales;
<br>
<br>"(6) Federal Government programs are not sufficiently responsive to the needs of small business for export education and development of overseas marketing opportunities necessary to insure that small businesses realize their potential; and
<br>
<br>"(7) it is in the national interest to systematically and consistently promote and encourage small business participation in international markets.
<br>
<br>"(b) It is therefore the purpose of this part [enacting this section, amending section 636 of this title, and enacting provisions set out as notes under sections 631 and 649 of this title] to encourage and promote small business exporting by—
<br>
<br>"(1) providing educational and marketing assistance to small businesses;
<br>
<br>"(2) insuring better access to export information and assistance for small businesses by upgrading and expanding the export development programs and services of the Department of Commerce and the Small Business Administration; and

<br>"(3) promoting the competitive viability of such firms in export trade and encouraging increased tourism in the United States by creating a program to provide limited financial, technical, and management assistance as may be necessary."
