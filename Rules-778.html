<br>SUBCHAPTER I—STATE REGULATION OF INSURANCE
<br>§6711. Functional regulation of insurance
<br>
<br>The insurance activities of any person (including a national bank exercising its power to act as agent under section 92 of title 12) shall be functionally regulated by the States, subject to section 6701 of this title.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 106–102, title III, §301, Nov. 12, 1999, 113 Stat. 1407.)
<br>§6712. Insurance underwriting in national banks
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in section 6713 of this title, a national bank and the subsidiaries of a national bank may not provide insurance in a State as principal except that this prohibition shall not apply to authorized products.
<br>(b) Authorized products
<br>
<br>For the purposes of this section, a product is authorized if—
<br>
<br>(1) as of January 1, 1999, the Comptroller of the Currency had determined in writing that national banks may provide such product as principal, or national banks were in fact lawfully providing such product as principal;
<br>
<br>(2) no court of relevant jurisdiction had, by final judgment, overturned a determination of the Comptroller of the Currency that national banks may provide such product as principal; and
<br>
<br>(3) the product is not title insurance, or an annuity contract the income of which is subject to tax treatment under section 72 of title 26.
<br>(c) Definition
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, the term "insurance" means—
<br>
<br>(1) any product regulated as insurance as of January 1, 1999, in accordance with the relevant State insurance law, in the State in which the product is provided;
<br>
<br>(2) any product first offered after January 1, 1999, which—
<br>
<br>(A) a State insurance regulator determines shall be regulated as insurance in the State in which the product is provided because the product insures, guarantees, or indemnifies against liability, loss of life, loss of health, or loss through damage to or destruction of property, including, but not limited to, surety bonds, life insurance, health insurance, title insurance, and property and casualty insurance (such as private passenger or commercial automobile, homeowners, mortgage, commercial multiperil, general liability, professional liability, workers' compensation, fire and allied lines, farm owners multiperil, aircraft, fidelity, surety, medical malpractice, ocean marine, inland marine, and boiler and machinery insurance); and
<br>
<br>(B) is not a product or service of a bank that is—
<br>
<br>(i) a deposit product;
<br>
<br>(ii) a loan, discount, letter of credit, or other extension of credit;
<br>
<br>(iii) a trust or other fiduciary service;
<br>
<br>(iv) a qualified financial contract (as defined in or determined pursuant to section 1821(e)(8)(D)(i) of title 12); or
<br>
<br>(v) a financial guaranty, except that this subparagraph (B) shall not apply to a product that includes an insurance component such that if the product is offered or proposed to be offered by the bank as principal—
<br>
<br>(I) it would be treated as a life insurance contract under section 7702 of title 26; or
<br>
<br>(II) in the event that the product is not a letter of credit or other similar extension of credit, a qualified financial contract, or a financial guaranty, it would qualify for treatment for losses incurred with respect to such product under section 832(b)(5) of title 26, if the bank were subject to tax as an insurance company under section 831 of that title; or
<br>
<br>(3) any annuity contract, the income on which is subject to tax treatment under section 72 of title 26.
<br>(d) Rule of construction
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, providing insurance (including reinsurance) outside the United States that insures, guarantees, or indemnifies insurance products provided in a State, or that indemnifies an insurance company with regard to insurance products provided in a State, shall be considered to be providing insurance as principal in that State.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 106–102, title III, §302, Nov. 12, 1999, 113 Stat. 1407.)
<br>§6713. Title insurance activities of national banks and their affiliates
<br>(a) General prohibition
<br>
<br>No national bank may engage in any activity involving the underwriting or sale of title insurance.
<br>(b) Nondiscrimination parity exception
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of law (including section 6701 of this title), in the case of any State in which banks organized under the laws of such State are authorized to sell title insurance as agent, a national bank may sell title insurance as agent in such State, but only in the same manner, to the same extent, and under the same restrictions as such State banks are authorized to sell title insurance as agent in such State.
<br>(2) Coordination with "wildcard" provision
<br>
<br>A State law which authorizes State banks to engage in any activities in such State in which a national bank may engage shall not be treated as a statute which authorizes State banks to sell title insurance as agent, for purposes of paragraph (1).
<br>(c) Grandfathering with consistent regulation
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3) and notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b), a national bank, and a subsidiary of a national bank, may conduct title insurance activities which such national bank or subsidiary was actively and lawfully conducting before November 12, 1999.
<br>(2) Insurance affiliate
<br>
<br>In the case of a national bank which has an affiliate which provides insurance as principal and is not a subsidiary of the bank, the national bank and any subsidiary of the national bank may not engage in the underwriting of title insurance pursuant to paragraph (1).
<br>(3) Insurance subsidiary
<br>
<br>In the case of a national bank which has a subsidiary which provides insurance as principal and has no affiliate other than a subsidiary which provides insurance as principal, the national bank may not directly engage in any activity involving the underwriting of title insurance.
<br>(d) "Affiliate" and "subsidiary" defined
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, the terms "affiliate" and "subsidiary" have the same meanings as in section 1841 of title 12.
<br>(e) Rule of construction
<br>
<br>No provision of this Act or any other Federal law shall be construed as superseding or affecting a State law which was in effect before November 12, 1999, and which prohibits title insurance from being offered, provided, or sold in such State, or from being underwritten with respect to real property in such State, by any person whatsoever.

<br>§6714. Expedited and equalized dispute resolution for Federal regulators
<br>(a) Filing in Court of Appeals
<br>
<br>In the case of a regulatory conflict between a State insurance regulator and a Federal regulator regarding insurance issues, including whether a State law, rule, regulation, order, or interpretation regarding any insurance sales or solicitation activity is properly treated as preempted under Federal law, the Federal or State regulator may seek expedited judicial review of such determination by the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the State is located or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit by filing a petition for review in such court.
<br>(b) Expedited review
<br>
<br>The United States Court of Appeals in which a petition for review is filed in accordance with subsection (a) shall complete all action on such petition, including rendering a judgment, before the end of the 60-day period beginning on the date on which such petition is filed, unless all parties to such proceeding agree to any extension of such period.

<br>
<br>Any request for certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States of any judgment of a United States Court of Appeals with respect to a petition for review under this section shall be filed with the Supreme Court of the United States as soon as practicable after such judgment is issued.

<br>
<br>No petition may be filed under this section challenging an order, ruling, determination, or other action of a Federal regulator or State insurance regulator after the later of—
<br>
<br>(1) the end of the 12-month period beginning on the date on which the first public notice is made of such order, ruling, determination or other action in its final form; or
<br>
<br>(2) the end of the 6-month period beginning on the date on which such order, ruling, determination, or other action takes effect.
<br>(e) Standard of review

<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 106–102, title III, §304, Nov. 12, 1999, 113 Stat. 1409.)
<br>§6715. Certain State affiliation laws preempted for insurance companies and affiliates
<br>
<br>Except as provided in section 6701(c)(2) of this title, no State may, by law, regulation, order, interpretation, or otherwise—
<br>
<br>(1) prevent or significantly interfere with the ability of any insurer, or any affiliate of an insurer (whether such affiliate is organized as a stock company, mutual holding company, or otherwise), to become a financial holding company or to acquire control of a depository institution;
<br>
<br>(2) limit the amount of an insurer's assets that may be invested in the voting securities of a depository institution (or any company which controls such institution), except that the laws of an insurer's State of domicile may limit the amount of such investment to an amount that is not less than 5 percent of the insurer's admitted assets; or
<br>
<br>(3) prevent, significantly interfere with, or have the authority to review, approve, or disapprove a plan of reorganization by which an insurer proposes to reorganize from mutual form to become a stock insurer (whether as a direct or indirect subsidiary of a mutual holding company or otherwise) unless such State is the State of domicile of the insurer.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 106–102, title III, §306, Nov. 12, 1999, 113 Stat. 1415.)
<br>§6716. Interagency consultation
<br>(a) Purpose
<br>
<br>It is the intention of the Congress that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, as the umbrella supervisor for financial holding companies, and the State insurance regulators, as the functional regulators of companies engaged in insurance activities, coordinate efforts to supervise companies that control both a depository institution and a company engaged in insurance activities regulated under State law. In particular, Congress believes that the Board and the State insurance regulators should share, on a confidential basis, information relevant to the supervision of companies that control both a depository institution and a company engaged in insurance activities, including information regarding the financial health of the consolidated organization and information regarding transactions and relationships between insurance companies and affiliated depository institutions. The appropriate Federal banking agencies for depository institutions should also share, on a confidential basis, information with the relevant State insurance regulators regarding transactions and relationships between depository institutions and affiliated companies engaged in insurance activities. The purpose of this section is to encourage this coordination and confidential sharing of information, and to thereby improve both the efficiency and the quality of the supervision of financial holding companies and their affiliated depository institutions and companies engaged in insurance activities.
<br>(b) Examination results and other information
<br>(1) Information of the Board
<br>
<br>Upon the request of the appropriate insurance regulator of any State, the Board may provide any information of the Board regarding the financial condition, risk management policies, and operations of any financial holding company that controls a company that is engaged in insurance activities and is regulated by such State insurance regulator, and regarding any transaction or relationship between such an insurance company and any affiliated depository institution. The Board may provide any other information to the appropriate State insurance regulator that the Board believes is necessary or appropriate to permit the State insurance regulator to administer and enforce applicable State insurance laws.
<br>(2) Banking agency information
<br>
<br>Upon the request of the appropriate insurance regulator of any State, the appropriate Federal banking agency may provide any information of the agency regarding any transaction or relationship between a depository institution supervised by such Federal banking agency and any affiliated company that is engaged in insurance activities regulated by such State insurance regulator. The appropriate Federal banking agency may provide any other information to the appropriate State insurance regulator that the agency believes is necessary or appropriate to permit the State insurance regulator to administer and enforce applicable State insurance laws.
<br>(3) State insurance regulator information
<br>
<br>Upon the request of the Board or the appropriate Federal banking agency, a State insurance regulator may provide any examination or other reports, records, or other information to which such insurance regulator may have access with respect to a company which—
<br>
<br>(A) is engaged in insurance activities and regulated by such insurance regulator; and
<br>
<br>(B) is an affiliate of a depository institution or financial holding company.
<br>(c) Consultation
<br>
<br>Before making any determination relating to the initial affiliation of, or the continuing affiliation of, a depository institution or financial holding company with a company engaged in insurance activities, the appropriate Federal banking agency shall consult with the appropriate State insurance regulator of such company and take the views of such insurance regulator into account in making such determination.
<br>(d) Effect on other authority
<br>
<br>Nothing in this section shall limit in any respect the authority of the appropriate Federal banking agency with respect to a depository institution or bank holding company or any affiliate thereof under any provision of law.
<br>(e) Confidentiality and privilege
<br>(1) Confidentiality
<br>
<br>The appropriate Federal banking agency shall not provide any information or material that is entitled to confidential treatment under applicable Federal banking agency regulations, or other applicable law, to a State insurance regulator unless such regulator agrees to maintain the information or material in confidence and to take all reasonable steps to oppose any effort to secure disclosure of the information or material by the regulator. The appropriate Federal banking agency shall treat as confidential any information or material obtained from a State insurance regulator that is entitled to confidential treatment under applicable State regulations, or other applicable law, and take all reasonable steps to oppose any effort to secure disclosure of the information or material by the Federal banking agency.
<br>(2) Privilege
<br>
<br>The provision pursuant to this section of information or material by a Federal banking agency or State insurance regulator shall not constitute a waiver of, or otherwise affect, any privilege to which the information or material is otherwise subject.
<br>(f) Definitions
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:
<br>(1) Appropriate Federal banking agency; depository institution
<br>
<br>The terms "appropriate Federal banking agency" and "depository institution" have the same meanings as in section 1813 of title 12.

<br>The certificate of authority, agents' appointments and licenses, rates, approvals and other items that a licensed State allows and that are in existence immediately prior to the date that a redomesticating insurer transfers its domicile pursuant to this subchapter shall continue in full force and effect upon transfer, if the insurer remains duly qualified to transact the business of insurance in such licensed State.
<br>(d) Effectiveness of outstanding policies and contracts
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>All outstanding insurance policies and annuities contracts of a redomesticating insurer shall remain in full force and effect and need not be endorsed as to the new domicile of the insurer, unless so ordered by the State insurance regulator of a licensed State, and then only in the case of outstanding policies and contracts whose owners reside in such licensed State.
<br>(2) Forms
<br>
<br>(A) Applicable State law may require a redomesticating insurer to file new policy forms with the State insurance regulator of a licensed State on or before the effective date of the transfer.
<br>
<br>(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), a redomesticating insurer may use existing policy forms with appropriate endorsements to reflect the new domicile of the redomesticating insurer until the new policy forms are approved for use by the State insurance regulator of such licensed State.
<br>(e) Notice
<br>
<br>A redomesticating insurer shall give notice of the proposed transfer to the State insurance regulator of each licensed State and shall file promptly any resulting amendments to corporate documents required to be filed by a foreign licensed mutual insurer with the insurance regulator of each such licensed State.
<br>(f) Procedural requirements
<br>
<br>No mutual insurer may redomesticate to another State and reorganize into a mutual holding company pursuant to this section unless the State insurance regulator of the transferee domicile determines that the plan of reorganization of the insurer includes the following requirements:
<br>(1) Approval by board of directors and policyholders
<br>
<br>The reorganization is approved by at least a majority of the board of directors of the mutual insurer and at least a majority of the policyholders who vote after notice, disclosure of the reorganization and the effects of the transaction on policyholder contractual rights, and reasonable opportunity to vote, in accordance with such notice, disclosure, and voting procedures as are approved by the State insurance regulator of the transferee domicile.
<br>(2) Continued voting control by policyholders; review of public stock offering
<br>
<br>After the consummation of a reorganization, the policyholders of the reorganized insurer shall have the same voting rights with respect to the mutual holding company as they had before the reorganization with respect to the mutual insurer. With respect to an initial public offering of stock, the offering shall be conducted in compliance with applicable securities laws and in a manner approved by the State insurance regulator of the transferee domicile.
<br>(3) Award of stock or grant of options to officers and directors
<br>
<br>During the applicable period provided for under the State law of the transferee domicile following completion of an initial public offering, or for a period of six months if no such applicable period is provided, neither a stock holding company nor the converted insurer shall award any stock options or stock grants to persons who are elected officers or directors of the mutual holding company, the stock holding company, or the converted insurer, except with respect to any such awards or options to which a person is entitled as a policyholder and as approved by the State insurance regulator of the transferee domicile.
<br>(4) Policyholder rights
<br>
<br>Upon reorganization into a mutual holding company, the contractual rights of the policyholders are preserved.
<br>(5) Fair and equitable treatment of policyholders
<br>
<br>The reorganization is approved as fair and equitable to the policyholders by the insurance regulator of the transferee domicile.

<br>§6733. Effect on State laws restricting redomestication
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>Unless otherwise permitted by this subchapter, State laws of any transferor domicile that conflict with the purposes and intent of this subchapter are preempted, including but not limited to—
<br>
<br>(1) any law that has the purpose or effect of impeding the activities of, taking any action against, or applying any provision of law or regulation to, any insurer or an affiliate of such insurer because that insurer or any affiliate plans to redomesticate, or has redomesticated, pursuant to this subchapter;
<br>
<br>(2) any law that has the purpose or effect of impeding the activities of, taking action against, or applying any provision of law or regulation to, any insured or any insurance licensee or other intermediary because such person has procured insurance from or placed insurance with any insurer or affiliate of such insurer that plans to redomesticate, or has redomesticated, pursuant to this subchapter, but only to the extent that such law would treat such insured licensee or other intermediary differently than if the person procured insurance from, or placed insurance with, an insured licensee or other intermediary which had not redomesticated; and
<br>
<br>(3) any law that has the purpose or effect of terminating, because of the redomestication of a mutual insurer pursuant to this subchapter, any certificate of authority, agent appointment or license, rate approval, or other approval, of any State insurance regulator or other State authority in existence immediately prior to the redomestication in any State other than the transferee domicile.
<br>(b) Differential treatment prohibited
<br>
<br>No State law, regulation, interpretation, or functional equivalent thereof, of a State other than a transferee domicile may treat a redomesticating or redomesticated insurer or any affiliate thereof any differently than an insurer operating in that State that is not a redomesticating or redomesticated insurer.
<br>(c) Laws prohibiting operations
<br>
<br>If any licensed State fails to issue, delays the issuance of, or seeks to revoke an original or renewal certificate of authority of a redomesticated insurer promptly following redomestication, except on grounds and in a manner consistent with its past practices regarding the issuance of certificates of authority to foreign insurers that are not redomesticating, then the redomesticating insurer shall be exempt from any State law of the licensed State to the extent that such State law or the operation of such State law would make unlawful, or regulate, directly or indirectly, the operation of the redomesticated insurer, except that such licensed State may require the redomesticated insurer to—
<br>
<br>(1) comply with the unfair claim settlement practices law of the licensed State;
<br>
<br>(2) pay, on a nondiscriminatory basis, applicable premium and other taxes which are levied on licensed insurers or policyholders under the laws of the licensed State;
<br>
<br>(3) register with and designate the State insurance regulator as its agent solely for the purpose of receiving service of legal documents or process;
<br>
<br>(4) submit to an examination by the State insurance regulator in any licensed State in which the redomesticated insurer is doing business to determine the insurer's financial condition, if—
<br>
<br>(A) the State insurance regulator of the transferee domicile has not begun an examination of the redomesticated insurer and has not scheduled such an examination to begin before the end of the 1-year period beginning on the date of the redomestication; and
<br>
<br>(B) any such examination is coordinated to avoid unjustified duplication and repetition;
<br>
<br>(5) comply with a lawful order issued in—
<br>
<br>(A) a delinquency proceeding commenced by the State insurance regulator of any licensed State if there has been a judicial finding of financial impairment under paragraph (7); or
<br>
<br>(B) a voluntary dissolution proceeding;
<br>
<br>(6) comply with any State law regarding deceptive, false, or fraudulent acts or practices, except that if the licensed State seeks an injunction regarding the conduct described in this paragraph, such injunction must be obtained from a court of competent jurisdiction as provided in section 6734(a) of this title;
<br>
<br>(7) comply with an injunction issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, upon a petition by the State insurance regulator alleging that the redomesticating insurer is in hazardous financial condition or is financially impaired;
<br>
<br>(8) participate in any insurance insolvency guaranty association on the same basis as any other insurer licensed in the licensed State; and
<br>
<br>(9) require a person acting, or offering to act, as an insurance licensee for a redomesticated insurer in the licensed State to obtain a license from that State, except that such State may not impose any qualification or requirement that discriminates against a nonresident insurance licensee.

<br>
<br>The appropriate United States district court shall have exclusive jurisdiction over litigation arising under this section 1 involving any redomesticating or redomesticated insurer.
<br>(b) Severability

<br>(B) be the equivalent of a nonresident insurance producer license for purposes of authorizing the insurance producer to engage in the activities described in subparagraph (A) in any State where the member pays the licensing fee; and
