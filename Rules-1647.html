<br>(1) Creditworthiness
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The project and obligor shall be creditworthy, which shall be determined by the Secretary or the Administrator, as applicable.
<br>(B) Considerations
<br>
<br>In determining the creditworthiness of a project and obligor, the Secretary or the Administrator, as applicable, shall take into consideration relevant factors, including—
<br>
<br>(i) the terms, conditions, financial structure, and security features of the proposed financing;
<br>
<br>(ii) the dedicated revenue sources that will secure or fund the project obligations;
<br>

<br>
<br>(iv) the financial soundness and credit history of the obligor.

<br>
<br>The Secretary or the Administrator, as applicable, shall ensure that any financing for the project has appropriate security features, such as a rate covenant, supporting the project obligations to ensure repayment.
<br>(D) Rating opinion letters
<br>(i) Preliminary rating opinion letter
<br>
<br>The Secretary or the Administrator, as applicable, shall require each project applicant to provide, at the time of application, a preliminary rating opinion letter from at least 1 rating agency indicating that the senior obligations of the project (which may be the Federal credit instrument) have the potential to achieve an investment-grade rating.
<br>(ii) Final rating opinion letters
<br>
<br>The Secretary or the Administrator, as applicable, shall require each project applicant to provide, prior to final acceptance and financing of the project, final rating opinion letters from at least 2 rating agencies indicating that the senior obligations of the project have an investment-grade rating.
<br>(E) Special rule for certain combined projects
<br>
<br>The Administrator shall develop a credit evaluation process for a Federal credit instrument provided to—
<br>
<br>(i) a State infrastructure financing authority for a project under section 3905(9) of this title, which may include requiring the provision of a final rating opinion letter from at least one rating agency; or

<br>For a project described in paragraph (2) or (3) of section 3905 of this title that serves a community of not more than 25,000 individuals, the eligible project costs of a project shall be reasonably anticipated to be not less than $5,000,000.
<br>(3) Dedicated revenue sources
<br>
<br>The Federal credit instrument for the project shall be repayable, in whole or in part, from dedicated revenue sources that also secure the project obligations.
<br>(4) Public sponsorship of private entities
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>If an eligible project is carried out by an entity that is not a State or local government or an agency or instrumentality of a State or local government or a tribal government or consortium of tribal governments, the project shall be publicly sponsored.
<br>(B) Public sponsorship
<br>
<br>For purposes of this chapter, a project shall be considered to be publicly sponsored if the obligor can demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Secretary or the Administrator, as appropriate, that the project applicant has consulted with the affected State, local, or tribal government in which the project is located, or is otherwise affected by the project, and that such government supports the proposed project.
<br>(5) Use of existing financing mechanisms

<br>
<br>(i) by the date that is 180 days after the date of receipt of a notification under subparagraph (A), the State infrastructure financing authority fails to enter into an assistance agreement to provide funds for the project; or
<br>
<br>(ii) the financial assistance to be provided by the State infrastructure financing authority will be at rates and terms that are less favorable than the rates and terms for financial assistance provided under this chapter.
<br>(6) Operation and maintenance plan

<br>Findings
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 105–383, title VI, §602, Nov. 13, 1998, 112 Stat. 3447, provided that: "The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>"(1) the recent outbreak of the harmful microbe Pfiesteria piscicida in the coastal waters of the United States is one example of potentially harmful algal blooms composed of naturally occurring species that reproduce explosively and that are increasing in frequency and intensity in the Nation's coastal waters;
<br>
<br>"(2) other recent occurrences of harmful algal blooms include red tides in the Gulf of Mexico and the Southeast; brown tides in New York and Texas; ciguatera fish poisoning in Hawaii, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands; and shellfish poisonings in the Gulf of Maine, the Pacific Northwest, and the Gulf of Alaska;
<br>
<br>"(3) in certain cases, harmful algal blooms have resulted in fish kills, the deaths of numerous endangered West Indian manatees, beach and shellfish bed closures, threats to public health and safety, and concern among the public about the safety of seafood;
<br>
<br>"(4) according to some scientists, the factors causing or contributing to harmful algal blooms may include excessive nutrients in coastal waters, other forms of pollution, the transfer of harmful species through ship ballast water, and ocean currents;
<br>
<br>"(5) harmful algal blooms may have been responsible for an estimated $1,000,000,000 in economic losses during the past decade;
<br>
<br>"(6) harmful algal blooms and blooms of non-toxic algal species may lead to other damaging marine conditions such as hypoxia (reduced oxygen concentrations), which are harmful or fatal to fish, shellfish, and benthic organisms;
<br>
<br>"(7) according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the Department of Commerce, 53 percent of United States estuaries experience hypoxia for at least part of the year and a 7,000 square mile area in the Gulf of Mexico off Louisiana and Texas suffers from hypoxia;
<br>
<br>"(8) according to some scientists, a factor believed to cause hypoxia is excessive nutrient loading into coastal waters;
<br>
<br>"(9) there is a need to identify more workable and effective actions to reduce nutrient loadings to coastal waters;
<br>
<br>"(10) the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, through its ongoing research, education, grant, and coastal resource management programs, possesses a full range of capabilities necessary to support a near and long-term comprehensive effort to prevent, reduce, and control harmful algal blooms and hypoxia;
<br>
<br>"(11) funding for the research and related programs of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will aid in improving the Nation's understanding and capabilities for addressing the human and environmental costs associated with harmful algal blooms and hypoxia; and
<br>
<br>"(12) other Federal agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Agriculture, and the National Science Foundation, along with the States, Indian tribes, and local governments, conduct important work related to the prevention, reduction, and control of harmful algal blooms and hypoxia."
<br>§4001a. Consultation required
<br>
<br>In developing the assessments, reports, and plans under the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act of 1998, the Task Force shall consult with the coastal States, Indian tribes, local governments, appropriate industries (including fisheries, agriculture, and fertilizer), academic institutions, and nongovernmental organizations with expertise in coastal zone science and management.
