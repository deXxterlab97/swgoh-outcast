<br>(b) Sanctions
<br>(1) Withholding clearance
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Treasury shall withhold or revoke the clearance required by section 60105 of title 46 of any vessel subject to this section that does not have the evidence of financial responsibility required for the vessel under this section.
<br>(2) Denying entry to or detaining vessels
<br>
<br>The Secretary may—
<br>
<br>(A) deny entry to any vessel to any place in the United States, or to the navigable waters, or
<br>
<br>(B) detain at the place,
<br>
<br>any vessel that, upon request, does not produce the evidence of financial responsibility required for the vessel under this section.
<br>(3) Seizure of vessel
<br>
<br>Any vessel subject to the requirements of this section which is found in the navigable waters without the necessary evidence of financial responsibility for the vessel shall be subject to seizure by and forfeiture to the United States.
<br>(c) Offshore facilities
<br>(1) In general
<br>(A) Evidence of financial responsibility required
<br>
<br>Except as provided in paragraph (2), a responsible party with respect to an offshore facility that—
<br>
<br>(i)(I) is located seaward of the line of ordinary low water along that portion of the coast that is in direct contact with the open sea and the line marking the seaward limit of inland waters; or
<br>
<br>(II) is located in coastal inland waters, such as bays or estuaries, seaward of the line of ordinary low water along that portion of the coast that is not in direct contact with the open sea;
<br>
<br>(ii) is used for exploring for, drilling for, producing, or transporting oil from facilities engaged in oil exploration, drilling, or production; and
<br>
<br>(iii) has a worst-case oil spill discharge potential of more than 1,000 barrels of oil (or a lesser amount if the President determines that the risks posed by such facility justify it),
<br>
<br>shall establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility in the amount required under subparagraph (B) or (C), as applicable.
<br>(B) Amount required generally
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subparagraph (C), the amount of financial responsibility for offshore facilities that meet the criteria of subparagraph (A) is—
<br>
<br>(i) $35,000,000 for an offshore facility located seaward of the seaward boundary of a State; or
<br>
<br>(ii) $10,000,000 for an offshore facility located landward of the seaward boundary of a State.
<br>(C) Greater amount
<br>
<br>If the President determines that an amount of financial responsibility for a responsible party greater than the amount required by subparagraph (B) is justified based on the relative operational, environmental, human health, and other risks posed by the quantity or quality of oil that is explored for, drilled for, produced, or transported by the responsible party, the evidence of financial responsibility required shall be for an amount determined by the President not exceeding $150,000,000.
<br>(D) Multiple facilities
<br>
<br>In a case in which a person is a responsible party for more than one facility subject to this subsection, evidence of financial responsibility need be established only to meet the amount applicable to the facility having the greatest financial responsibility requirement under this subsection.
<br>(E) Definition
<br>
<br>For the purpose of this paragraph, the seaward boundary of a State shall be determined in accordance with section 1301(b) of title 43.
<br>(2) Deepwater ports
<br>
<br>Each responsible party with respect to a deepwater port shall establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to meet the maximum amount of liability to which the responsible party could be subjected under section 2704(a) of this title in a case where the responsible party would be entitled to limit liability under that section. If the Secretary exercises the authority under section 2704(d)(2) of this title to lower the limit of liability for deepwater ports, the responsible party shall establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to meet the maximum amount of liability so established. In a case in which a person is the responsible party for more than one deepwater port, evidence of financial responsibility need be established only to meet the maximum liability applicable to the deepwater port having the greatest maximum liability.
<br>(e) 1 Methods of financial responsibility
<br>
<br>Financial responsibility under this section may be established by any one, or by any combination, of the following methods which the Secretary (in the case of a vessel) or the President (in the case of a facility) determines to be acceptable: evidence of insurance, surety bond, guarantee, letter of credit, qualification as a self-insurer, or other evidence of financial responsibility. Any bond filed shall be issued by a bonding company authorized to do business in the United States. In promulgating requirements under this section, the Secretary or the President, as appropriate, may specify policy or other contractual terms, conditions, or defenses which are necessary, or which are unacceptable, in establishing evidence of financial responsibility to effectuate the purposes of this Act.
<br>(f) Claims against guarantor
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Subject to paragraph (2), a claim for which liability may be established under section 2702 of this title may be asserted directly against any guarantor providing evidence of financial responsibility for a responsible party liable under that section for removal costs and damages to which the claim pertains. In defending against such a claim, the guarantor may invoke—
<br>
<br>(A) all rights and defenses which would be available to the responsible party under this Act;
<br>
<br>(B) any defense authorized under subsection (e); and
<br>
<br>(C) the defense that the incident was caused by the willful misconduct of the responsible party.
<br>
<br>The guarantor may not invoke any other defense that might be available in proceedings brought by the responsible party against the guarantor.
<br>(2) Further requirement
<br>
<br>A claim may be asserted pursuant to paragraph (1) directly against a guarantor providing evidence of financial responsibility under subsection (c)(1) with respect to an offshore facility only if—
<br>
<br>(A) the responsible party for whom evidence of financial responsibility has been provided has denied or failed to pay a claim under this Act on the basis of being insolvent, as defined under section 101(32) of title 11, and applying generally accepted accounting principles;
<br>
<br>(B) the responsible party for whom evidence of financial responsibility has been provided has filed a petition for bankruptcy under title 11; or
<br>
<br>(C) the claim is asserted by the United States for removal costs and damages or for compensation paid by the Fund under this Act, including costs incurred by the Fund for processing compensation claims.
<br>(3) Rulemaking authority
<br>
<br>Not later than 1 year after October 19, 1996, the President shall promulgate regulations to establish a process for implementing paragraph (2) in a manner that will allow for the orderly and expeditious presentation and resolution of claims and effectuate the purposes of this Act.
<br>(g) Limitation on guarantor's liability
<br>
<br>Nothing in this Act shall impose liability with respect to an incident on any guarantor for damages or removal costs which exceed, in the aggregate, the amount of financial responsibility which that guarantor has provided for a responsible party pursuant to this section. The total liability of the guarantor on direct action for claims brought under this Act with respect to an incident shall be limited to that amount.
<br>(h) Continuation of regulations

<br>Any regulation relating to financial responsibility, which has been issued pursuant to any provision of law repealed or superseded by this Act, and which is in effect on the date immediately preceding the effective date of this Act, is deemed and shall be construed to be a regulation issued pursuant to this section.

<br>Statutory Notes and Related Subsidiaries
<br>Termination of Advisory Boards
<br>
<br>Advisory boards established after Jan. 5, 1973, to terminate not later than the expiration of the 2-year period beginning on the date of their establishment, unless, in the case of a board established by the President or an officer of the Federal Government, such board is renewed by appropriate action prior to the expiration of such 2-year period, or in the case of a board established by Congress, its duration is otherwise provided for by law. See sections 3(2) and 14 of Pub. L. 92–463, Oct. 6, 1972, 86 Stat. 770, 776, set out in the Appendix to Title 5, Government Organization and Employees.
<br>§2732. Terminal and tanker oversight and monitoring
<br>(a) Short title and findings
<br>(1) Short title
<br>
<br>This section may be cited as the "Oil Terminal and Oil Tanker Environmental Oversight and Monitoring Act of 1990".
<br>(2) Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(A) the March 24, 1989, grounding and rupture of the fully loaded oil tanker, the EXXON VALDEZ, spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil in Prince William Sound, an environmentally sensitive area;
<br>
<br>(B) many people believe that complacency on the part of the industry and government personnel responsible for monitoring the operation of the Valdez terminal and vessel traffic in Prince William Sound was one of the contributing factors to the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill;
<br>
<br>(C) one way to combat this complacency is to involve local citizens in the process of preparing, adopting, and revising oil spill contingency plans;
<br>
<br>(D) a mechanism should be established which fosters the long-term partnership of industry, government, and local communities in overseeing compliance with environmental concerns in the operation of crude oil terminals;
<br>
<br>(E) such a mechanism presently exists at the Sullom Voe terminal in the Shetland Islands and this terminal should serve as a model for others;
<br>
<br>(F) because of the effective partnership that has developed at Sullom Voe, Sullom Voe is considered the safest terminal in Europe;
<br>
<br>(G) the present system of regulation and oversight of crude oil terminals in the United States has degenerated into a process of continual mistrust and confrontation;
<br>
<br>(H) only when local citizens are involved in the process will the trust develop that is necessary to change the present system from confrontation to consensus;
<br>
<br>(I) a pilot program patterned after Sullom Voe should be established in Alaska to further refine the concepts and relationships involved; and
<br>
<br>(J) similar programs should eventually be established in other major crude oil terminals in the United States because the recent oil spills in Texas, Delaware, and Rhode Island indicate that the safe transportation of crude oil is a national problem.
<br>(b) Demonstration programs
<br>(1) Establishment
<br>
<br>There are established 2 Oil Terminal and Oil Tanker Environmental Oversight and Monitoring Demonstration Programs (hereinafter referred to as "Programs") to be carried out in the State of Alaska.

<br>Amendments
<br>
<br>1992—Subsec. (a). Pub.
