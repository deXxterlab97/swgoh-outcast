<br>Global Crop Diversity Trust
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 110–246, title III, §3202, June 18, 2008, 122 Stat. 1836, as amended by Pub. L. 113–79, title III, §3206, Feb. 7, 2014, 128 Stat. 780; Pub. L. 115–334, title III, §3310, Dec. 20, 2018, 132 Stat. 4622, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(a) Contribution.—The Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development shall contribute funds to endow the Global Crop Diversity Trust (referred to in this section as the 'Trust') to assist in the conservation of genetic diversity in food crops through the collection and storage of the germplasm of food crops in a manner that provides for—
<br>
<br>"(1) the maintenance and storage of seed collections;
<br>
<br>"(2) the documentation and cataloguing of the genetics and characteristics of conserved seeds to ensure efficient reference for researchers, plant breeders, and the public;
<br>
<br>"(3) building the capacity of seed collection in developing countries;
<br>
<br>"(4) making information regarding crop genetic data publicly available for researchers, plant breeders, and the public (including through the provision of an accessible Internet website);
<br>
<br>"(5) the operation and maintenance of a back-up facility in which are stored duplicate samples of seeds, in the case of natural or man-made disasters; and
<br>
<br>"(6) oversight designed to ensure international coordination of those actions and efficient, public accessibility to that diversity through a cost-effective system.
<br>
<br>"(b) United States Contribution Limit.—

<br>International Food Reserve
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 95–426, title VI, §604, Oct. 7, 1978, 92 Stat. 986, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(a) The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>"(1) half a billion people suffer regularly from malnutrition or undernutrition;
<br>
<br>"(2) even very modest shortfalls in crop production can result in greatly increased human suffering, and undercut the benefits of bilateral and multilateral assistance programs, in poor developing countries with chronic food deficits;
<br>
<br>"(3) increasing variability in world food production and trade presents a serious threat not only to consumers but also to producers;
<br>
<br>"(4) the World Food Conference recognized the urgent need for an international undertaking to achieve a system of world food security based largely upon strategic food reserves;
<br>
<br>"(5) the Congress through legislation has repeatedly urged the President to negotiate with other nations to establish such a system of reserves;
<br>
<br>"(6) although the nations of the world have agreed to begin discussions on a system of grain reserves to regulate food availability, agreement on a global network of nationally held reserves still eludes the international community;
<br>
<br>"(7) while some progress has taken place in the United States in creating domestic farmer held reserves, the scale of such reserves does not insure adequate protection against fluctuations in world production and price; and
<br>
<br>"(8) the United States, as the world's leading producer of foodstuffs, remains in a unique position to provide the leadership necessary to make world food security a reality.
<br>
<br>"(b) It is therefore the sense of the Congress that the President should continue his efforts directed toward achievement of an agreement establishing an international network of nationally held grain reserves which provides for supply assurance to consumers and income security to producers."
<br>
<br>Similar provisions were contained in the following prior authorization act:
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 95–105, title V, §510, Aug. 17, 1977, 91 Stat. 860.
<br>Commission on Hunger and Malnutrition
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 95–426, title VII, §711, Oct. 7, 1978, 92 Stat. 994, which authorized funds to be appropriated for fiscal years 1979 and 1980 for a commission to conduct studies on global hunger and malnutrition, which commission was to make recommendations to the President and Congress on policies to increase the capacity of the United States to reduce hunger and malnutrition, was repealed by Pub. L. 97–241, title V, §505(a)(2), Aug. 24, 1982, 96 Stat. 299.
<br>Settlement of Debt Owed the United States
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 94–161, title III, §321, Dec. 20, 1975, 89 Stat. 868, provided that: "No debt owed to the United States by any foreign country with respect to the payment of any loan made under any program funded under this Act [see Short Title of 1975 Amendment note set out under section 2151 of this title] may be settled in an amount less than the full amount of such debt unless the Congress by concurrent resolution approves of such settlement."

<br>
<br>"(a) It is the sense of the Congress that the United States should participate fully in efforts to alleviate current and future food shortages which threaten the world. To this end, the President shall—
<br>
<br>"(1) encourage, support, and expedite, studies relating to the long-range implications of the world food situation (including studies of national and world production, distribution, and utilization of agricultural commodities and other foodstuffs) and support the organizing of a world food conference under United Nations auspices in 1974;
<br>
<br>"(2) request the member nations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to explore the means for assuring equitable access by all nations to national markets and mineral and agricultural resources;
<br>
<br>"(3) consult and cooperate with appropriate international agencies, such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, in determining the need for, the feasibility of, and cost on an equitably-shared basis of, establishing an international system of strategic food reserves; and
<br>
<br>"(4) report his findings and recommendations to the Congress on the implementation of this section no later than December 31, 1974.
<br>
<br>"(b) It is further the sense of the Congress that—
<br>
<br>"(1) in making assessments which would affect or relate to the level of domestic production, the Executive Branch should include in the estimates of overall utilization the expected demands for humanitarian food assistance through such programs as are carried out under the Food for Peace Act (Public Law 480) [7 U.S.C. 1691 et seq.]; and
<br>
<br>"(2) legislation providing increased flexibility for responding to emergency and humanitarian requirements for food assistance should be considered as promptly as possible to the end that the last sentence of section 401 of the Food for Peace Act (Public Law 480) [7 U.S.C. 1731], may be amended by striking the period and inserting in lieu thereof a comma and the following: 'unless the Secretary determines that some part of the exportable supply should be used to carry out the national interest and humanitarian objectives of this Act [see Short Title of 1973 Amendment note set out under section 2151 of this title]'."

<br>"(a) Findings.—Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>"(1) The report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States stated that '[e]ducation that teaches tolerance, the dignity and value of each individual, and respect for different beliefs is a key element in any global strategy to eliminate Islamist terrorism'.
<br>
<br>"(2) The report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States concluded that ensuring educational opportunity is essential to the efforts of the United States to defeat global terrorism and recommended that the United States Government 'should offer to join with other nations in generously supporting [spending funds] . . . directly for building and operating primary and secondary schools in those Muslim states that commit to sensibly investing their own money in public education'.
<br>
<br>"(3) While Congress endorsed such a program in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (Public Law 108–458 [see Tables for classification]), such a program has not been established.
<br>
<br>"(b) Policy.—It is the policy of the United States—
<br>
<br>"(1) to work toward the goal of dramatically increasing the availability of modern basic education through public schools in predominantly Muslim countries, which will reduce the influence of radical madrassas and other institutions that promote religious extremism;
<br>
<br>"(2) to join with other countries in generously supporting the International Muslim Youth Opportunity Fund authorized under section 7114 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 [22 U.S.C. 2228], as amended by section 2012 of this Act, with the goal of building and supporting public primary and secondary schools in predominantly Muslim countries that commit to sensibly investing the resources of such countries in modern public education;
<br>
