<br>
<br>We face immediate and compelling needs for better protection of life and property from natural hazards, and for a better understanding of the total environment—an understanding which will enable us more effectively to monitor and predict its actions, and ultimately, perhaps to exercise some degree of control over them.
<br>
<br>We also face a compelling need for exploration and development leading to the intelligent use of our marine resources. The global oceans, which constitute nearly three-fourths of the surface of our planet, are today the least-understood, the least-developed, and the least-protected part of our earth. Food from the oceans will increasingly be a key element in the world's fight against hunger. The mineral resources of the ocean beds and of the oceans themselves, are being increasingly tapped to meet the growing world demand. We must understand the nature of these resources, and assure their development without either contaminating the marine environment or upsetting its balance.
<br>
<br>Establishment of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration—NOAA—within the Department of Commerce would enable us to approach these tasks in a coordinated way. By employing a unified approach to the problems of the oceans and atmosphere, we can increase our knowledge and expand our opportunities not only in those areas, but in the third major component of our environment, the solid earth, as well.
<br>
<br>Scattered through various Federal departments and agencies, we already have the scientific, technological, and administrative resources to make an effective, unified approach possible. What we need is to bring them together. Establishment of NOAA would do so.
<br>
<br>By far the largest of the components being merged would be the Commerce Department's Environmental Science Services Administration (ESSA), with some 10,000 employees (70 percent of NOAA's total personnel strength) and estimated Fiscal 1970 expenditures of almost $200 million. Placing NOAA within the Department of Commerce therefore entails the least dislocation, while also placing it within a department which has traditionally been a center for service activities in the scientific and technological area.
<br>components of noaa
<br>
<br>Under terms of Reorganization Plan No. 4, the programs of the following organizations would be moved into NOAA:
<br>
<br>—The Environmental Science Services Administration (from within the Department of Commerce).
<br>
<br>—Elements of the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries (from the Department of the Interior).
<br>
<br>—The marine sport fish program of the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife (from the Department of the Interior).
<br>
<br>—The Marine Minerals Technology Center of the Bureau of Mines (from the Department of the Interior).
<br>
<br>—The Office of Sea Grant Programs (from the National Science Foundation).
<br>
<br>—Elements of the U.S. Lake Survey (from the Department of the Army).
<br>
<br>In addition, by executive action, the programs of the following organizations would be transferred to NOAA:
<br>
<br>—The National Oceanographic Data Center (from the Department of the Navy).
<br>
<br>—The National Oceanographic Instrumentation Center (from the Department of the Navy).
<br>
<br>—The National Data Buoy Project (from the Department of Transportation).
<br>
<br>In brief, these are the principal functions of the programs and agencies to be combined:
<br>THE ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE SERVICES ADMINISTRATION
<br>
<br>(ESSA) comprises the following components:
<br>
<br>—The Weather Bureau (weather, marine, river and flood forecasting and warning).
<br>
<br>—The Coast and Geodetic Survey (earth and marine description, mapping and charting).
<br>
<br>—The Environmental Data Service (storage and retrieval of environmental data).
<br>
<br>—The National Environmental Satellite Center (observation of the global environment from earth-orbiting satellites).
<br>
<br>—The ESSA Research Laboratories (research on physical environmental problems).
<br>
<br>ESSA's activities include observing and predicting the state of the oceans, the state of the lower and upper atmosphere, and the size and shape of the earth. It maintains the nation's warning systems for such natural hazards as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes and seismic sea waves. It provides information for national defense, agriculture, transportation and industry.
<br>
<br>ESSA monitors atmospheric, oceanic and geophysical phenomena on a global basis, through an unparalleled complex of air, ocean, earth and space facilities. It also prepares aeronautical and marine maps and charts.
<br>
<br>Bureau of Commercial Fisheries and marine sport fish activities.—Those fishery activities of the Department of the Interior's U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service which are ocean related and those which are directed toward commercial fishing would be transferred. The Fish and Wildlife Service's Bureau of Commercial Fisheries has the dual function of strengthening the fishing industry and promoting conservation of fishery stocks. It conducts research on important marine species and on fundamental oceanography, and operates a fleet of oceanographic vessels and a number of laboratories. Most of its activities would be transferred. From the Fish and Wildlife Service's Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife, the marine sport fishing program would be transferred. This involves five supporting laboratories and three ships engaged in activities to enhance marine sport fishing opportunities.
<br>
<br>The Marine Minerals Technology Center is concerned with the development of marine mining technology.
<br>
<br>Office of Sea Grant Programs.—The Sea Grant Program was authorized in 1966 to permit the Federal Government to assist the academic and industrial communities in developing marine resources and technology. It aims at strengthening education and training of marine specialists, supporting applied research in the recovery and use of marine resources, and developing extension and advisory services. The Office carries out these objectives by making grants to selected academic institutions.
<br>
<br>The U.S. Lake Survey has two primary missions. It prepares and publishes navigation charts of the Great Lakes and tributary waters and conducts research on a variety of hydraulic and hydrologic phenomena of the Great Lakes' waters. Its activities are very similar to those conducted along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts by ESSA's Coast and Geodetic Survey.
<br>
<br>The National Oceanographic Data Center is responsible for the collection and dissemination of oceanographic data accumulated by all Federal agencies.
<br>
<br>The National Oceanographic Instrumentation Center provides a central Federal service for the calibration and testing of oceanographic instruments.
<br>
<br>The National Data Buoy Development Project was established to determine the feasibility of deploying a system of automatic ocean buoys to obtain oceanic and atmospheric data.
<br>role of noaa
<br>
<br>Drawing these activities together into a single agency would make possible a balanced Federal program to improve our understanding of the resources of the sea, and permit their development and use while guarding against the sort of thoughtless exploitation that in the past laid waste to so many of our precious natural assets. It would make possible a consolidated program for achieving a more comprehensive understanding of oceanic and atmospheric phenomena, which so greatly affect our lives and activities. It would facilitate the cooperation between public and private interests that can best serve the interests of all.
<br>
<br>I expect that NOAA would exercise leadership in developing a national oceanic and atmospheric program of research and development. It would coordinate its own scientific and technical resources with the technical and operational capabilities of other government agencies and private institutions. As important, NOAA would continue to provide those services to other agencies of government, industry and private individuals which have become essential to the efficient operation of our transportation systems, our agriculture and our national security. I expect it to maintain continuing and close liaison with the new Environmental Protection Agency and the Council on Environmental Quality as part of an effort to ensure that environmental questions are dealt with in their totality and that they benefit from the full range of the government's technical and human resources.
<br>
<br>Authorities who have studied this matter, including the Commission on Marine Science, Engineering and Resources, strongly recommended the creation of a National Advisory Committee for the Oceans. I agree. Consequently, I will request, upon approval of the plan, that the Secretary of Commerce establish a National Advisory Committee for the Oceans and the Atmosphere to advise him on the progress of governmental and private programs in achieving the nation's oceanic and atmospheric objectives.
<br>AN ON-GOING PROCESS
<br>
<br>The reorganizations which I am here proposing afford both the Congress and the Executive Branch an opportunity to re-evaluate the adequacy of existing program authorities involved in these consolidations. As these two new organizations come into being, we may well find that supplementary legislation to perfect their authorities will be necessary. I look forward to working with the Congress in this task.
<br>
<br>In formulating these reorganization plans, I have been greatly aided by the work of the President's Advisory Council on Executive Organization (the Ash Council), the Commission on Marine Science, Engineering and Resources (the Stratton Commission, appointed by President Johnson), my special task force on oceanography headed by Dr. James Wakelin, and by the information developed during both House and Senate hearings on proposed NOAA legislation.
<br>
<br>Many of those who have advised me have proposed additional reorganizations, and it may well be that in the future I shall recommend further changes. For the present, however, I think the two reorganizations transmitted today represent a sound and significant beginning. I also think that in practical terms, in this sensitive and rapidly developing area, it is better to proceed a step at a time—and thus to be sure that we are not caught up in a form of organizational indigestion from trying to rearrange too much at once. As we see how these changes work out, we will gain a better understanding of what further changes—in addition to these—might be desirable.
<br>
<br>Ultimately, our objective should be to insure that the nation's environmental and resource protection activities are so organized as to maximize both the effective coordination of all and the effective functioning of each.
<br>
<br>The Congress, the Administration and the public all share a profound commitment to the rescue of our natural environment, and the preservation of the Earth as a place both habitable by and hospitable to man. With its acceptance of these reorganization plans, the Congress will help us fulfill that commitment.

<br>Message of the President
<br>
<br>To the Congress of the United States:
<br>
<br>I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1970, prepared in accordance with chapter 9 of title 5 of the United States Code. The plan would transfer to the Secretary of Commerce various functions relating to the oceans and atmosphere, including commercial fishery functions, and would establish a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the Department of Commerce. My reasons for transmitting this plan are stated in a more extended accompanying message.
<br>
<br>After investigation, I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1970 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 901(a) of title 5 of the United States Code. In particular, the plan is responsive to section 901(a)(1), "to promote the better execution of the laws, the more effective management of the executive branch and of its agencies and functions, and the expeditious administration of the public business;" and section 901(a)(3) "to increase the efficiency of the operations of the Government to the fullest extent practicable."
<br>
<br>The reorganizations provided for in the plan make necessary the appointment and compensation of new officers as specified in section 2 of the plan. The rates of compensation fixed for these officers are comparable to those fixed for other officers in the executive branch who have similar responsibilities.
<br>
<br>The reorganization plan should result in the more efficient operation of the Government. It is not practical, however, to itemize or aggregate the exact expenditure reductions which will result from this action.

<br>Message of the President
<br>
<br>To the Congress of the United States:
<br>
<br>America is a nation unique in the political history of the world. More than any other nation, it is the sum of the energies and efforts of all of its people. The American tradition of voluntary involvement—of freely committing one's time and talents in the search for civic improvement and social progress—gives an extra dimension to the meaning of democracy. In the past decade the Federal Government has built on this tradition by developing channels for joining the spirit of voluntary citizen service in America with public needs, both domestically and abroad. Many of these efforts have had marked success. But the circumstances in which these efforts were conceived have changed.
<br>
<br>National and international needs have altered. The opportunities for voluntary service must be adapted and improved to meet these new needs.
<br>
<br>Recognizing that private channels of voluntary action are a vital source of strength in our national life, I have supported the establishment and development of the National Center for Voluntary Action. The National Center is a private, non-profit partner in the effort to generate and encourage volunteer service. The Center works to promote the establishment of local Voluntary Action Centers, as well as to assist in the expansion of voluntary action organizations already in existence. It stimulates voluntary action by providing information on successful voluntary efforts, and it assists in directing those who wish to volunteer services to areas and endeavors in which their services are needed.
<br>
<br>The National Center for Voluntary Action is functioning now to fill a vital need in the private voluntary sector. Now we must turn our attention to bringing government volunteer programs into line with new national priorities and new opportunities for meeting those priorities. We must take full advantage of the lessons of the past decade, and we must build on the experience of that period if we are to realize the full potential of voluntary citizen service. This is no longer a matter of choice. We cannot afford to misuse or ignore the considerable talents and energies of our people. In the coming years, the continued progress of our society is going to depend increasingly upon the willingness of more Americans to participate in voluntary service and upon our ability to channel their service effectively.
<br>
<br>One matter of consequence to the problems of properly channeling volunteer services and expanding government's role in the development of volunteer resources is the proliferation of government volunteer programs. It was perhaps inevitable that these programs would be generated almost at random across the spectrum of government concern for human needs. This occurred in a period when the Federal Government was still attempting to define its relationship with, and its purposes in, the area of voluntary service. Now the role of government has been confirmed and its responsibilities and obligations are clear. Meeting these responsibilities and obligations will be a long, difficult, and challenging adventure. But it is an adventure we can look to with excitement and with the knowledge that the only sure source of failure can be a failure of the will of the American people. I do not believe it will fail.
<br>
<br>The foundation for a greatly expanded government contribution to volunteer service already exists. Now we must consolidate that foundation in order to build on it. To accomplish this, I propose a reorganization of the present volunteer service system. Accordingly, I herewith transmit to the Congress Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1971, prepared in accordance with chapter 9 of title 5 of the United States Code. Reorganization would bring together within a single agency a number of voluntary action programs presently scattered throughout the executive branch of the Federal Government. The new agency would be called Action.
<br>COMPOSITION
<br>
<br>Under the reorganization plan Action would administer the functions of the following programs:
<br>
<br>—Volunteers in Service to America: VISTA volunteers work in domestic poverty areas to help the poor break the poverty cycle.
<br>
<br>—Auxiliary and Special Volunteer Programs in the Office of Economic Opportunity: At present the National Student Volunteer Program is administered under this authority. This program stimulates student voluntary action programs which deal with the problems of the poor.
<br>
<br>—Foster Grandparents: This program provides opportunities for the elderly poor to assist needy children.
<br>
<br>—Retired Senior Volunteer Program: RSVP provides opportunities for retired persons to perform voluntary services in their communities.
<br>

<br>
<br>After investigation I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in the accompanying reorganization plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 901(a) of title 5 of the United States Code. In particular, the plan is responsive to section 901(a)(1), "to promote the better execution of the laws, the more effective management of the executive branch and of its agencies and functions, and the expeditious administration of the public business;" and section 901(a)(3), "to increase the efficiency of the operations of the Government to the fullest extent practicable."
<br>
<br>The reorganizations provided for in the plan make necessary the appointment and compensation of new officers as specified in section 1 of the plan. The rates of compensation fixed for these officers would be comparable to those fixed for officers in the executive branch who have similar responsibilities.
<br>
<br>The reorganization plan should result in more efficient operation of the Government. It is not practical, however, to itemize or aggregate the exact expenditure reductions which would result from this action.
<br>
<br>Upon the establishment of Action, I would delegate to it the principal authority for the Peace Corps now vested in me as President and delegated to the Secretary of State. In addition, the function of the Office of Voluntary Action, now operating in the Department of Housing and Urban Development, would be transferred to the new agency by executive action.
<br>
<br>Finally, I will submit legislation which would include the transfer of the functions of the Teacher Corps from the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to the new agency. This legislation would expand authority to develop new uses of volunteer talents, it would provide a citizens' advisory board to work with the director of the new agency, and it would provide authority to match private contributions.
<br>GOALS
<br>
<br>Although reorganization is only a step, it is the essential first step toward the goal of a system of volunteer service which uses to the fullest advantages the power of all the American people to serve the purposes of the American nation.
<br>
<br>In pursuing this goal the new agency would, first, expand the testing and development of innovations in voluntary actions. Health services, housing the environment, educational development, manpower and community planning are just a few of the areas in which we would act to accomplish more through voluntary service, and I intend to ask for additional funds and additional authority for Action to explore new approaches to these and other problems.
<br>
<br>In the future, we are going to have to find new ways for more people to fulfill themselves and to lead satisfying and productive lives. The problems are of concern even now, but they must be put in perspective quickly because they will soon be upon us. I believe at least some of the answers will be found in volunteer service. Action would work to find those answers and apply them.
<br>
<br>Second, there are many Americans who want to contribute to our national life through voluntary citizen service, but who cannot serve full time. Their contributions must not be wasted. Volunteers in full-time service would work with part-time volunteers and the new agency would develop and provide opportunities for more people to give part-time service.
<br>
<br>Third, Action would bring together in one place programs which appeal predominantly to younger Americans with those that appeal to older Americans, and would work to bring the energy, the innovative spirit, the experience, and the skills of each to bear on specific problems. The generations in America share America's problems—they must share in the search for solutions so that we all may share in the benefits of our solutions.
<br>
<br>Fourth, Action would develop programs for combining foreign service with domestic service to accommodate volunteers interested in such an opportunity. I believe that young people in particular would be interested in the chance for this experience and would greatly benefit from it. I know there would be great value, for example, in permitting those who have served the needs of the poor abroad to turn their skills and experience to helping the poor at home, and vice versa. In addition, if volunteers are to reap the full benefit of serving, and if they are to be able to provide others the full benefit of their service, then we must open the doors to a fuller exchange of ideas and experiences between overseas and domestic volunteer efforts. These exchanges would considerably enhance the value of the experience gained in these endeavors by broadening the areas in which that experience is applied.
<br>
<br>Fifth, at the present time valuable professional skills offered in voluntary service are too frequently limited by narrow categorical programs when their broader application is urgently needed. For example, the contributions of businessmen made through SCORE and ACE are provided only through the Small Business Administration. We know that the skills of business can be used in many areas where they are not used presently. Action would open new channels for service and would permit a more extensive utilization of business and other vocational and professional abilities.
<br>
<br>Finally, by centralizing administrative functions of the volunteer services, the new agency would provide a more effective system of recruitment, training, and placement of full-time volunteers than the present circumstances permit. It would provide a single source of information and assistance for those who seek to volunteer full-time service. And it would permit more effective management of services than is currently possible in the administration of volunteer programs, as well as the more efficient use of resources.
<br>PRINCIPLES
<br>
<br>In restructuring our system of volunteer services, we can accomplish the goals which I have set forth. But we must do more than this. We must restructure our thinking about volunteer services. We must determine how to use our volunteer resources to accomplish more than they accomplish now. We need an increased effort to stimulate broader volunteer service, to involve more volunteers, and to involve them not simply as foot-soldiers in massive enterprises directed from the top, but in those often small and local efforts that show immediate results, that give immediate satisfaction—those efforts that return to citizens a sense of having a hand in the business of building America. Part of our rethinking of this matter must look to the past so that we may properly meet the needs of the present and prepare for the possibilities of the future.
<br>
<br>Volunteer service in poverty areas is a case in point. We already have considerable experience in dealing with the problems of poverty through the use of volunteers. Now we must build upon this experience and find new ways to use more effectively the volunteers presently serving in poverty areas, as well as in all other areas, and to stimulate new programs so that additional numbers of volunteers can assist in the solution of community and national problems.
<br>
<br>In line with this effort to build on what we have learned. Action would function with particular concern for these basic principles:
<br>
<br>—It would encourage local initiative, and would support local programs to solve local problems.
<br>
<br>—Where appropriate, the new agency would assign volunteers to assist, and work under the technical supervision of other Federal agencies, State and local agencies or organizations, and private sponsors.
<br>
<br>—The services of local part-time volunteers would be sought and supported in the effort to accomplish specific jobs. They would be assisted, when necessary, by full-time volunteers.
<br>
<br>—Universities and colleges, State, city and private organizations must be engaged in the effort to broaden opportunities for volunteer service and under the new agency they would be assisted in these efforts.
<br>
<br>—Finally, to meet the increasing need for skilled volunteers, Action would give increased emphasis to recruiting and applying the skills of trained craftsmen and professional workers.
<br>FUNDING
<br>
<br>To insure that the new agency has financial resources to begin working toward the goals I have outlined, I will seek for this agency an additional $20 million above the budget requests I have already submitted for the component agencies. These funds would be directed primarily to finding new ways to use volunteer services.
<br>CONCLUSION
<br>
<br>The early nineteenth century observer of America, Alexis de Tocqueville, was intrigued by the propensity of Americans to join together in promoting common purposes. "As soon as several of the inhabitants of the United States have taken up an opinion or a feeling which they wish to promote in the world, they look out for mutual assistance, and as soon as they have found one another out, they combine. From that moment they are no longer isolated men, but a power seen from afar * * *."
<br>
<br>Though we have seen the success of Government volunteer efforts in the past ten years, I believe voluntary citizen service is still little more than a power seen from afar. In relation to its potential, this power is virtually undeveloped. We must develop it.
<br>
<br>There are those today, as there always will be, who find infinite fault with life in this Nation and who conveniently forget that they share responsibility for the quality of life we lead. But our needs are too great for this attitude to be accepted. America belongs to all of its people. We are all responsible for the direction this Nation will take in the century ahead, for the quality of life we will lead and our children will lead. We are all responsible, whether we choose to be or not, for the survival and the success of the American experience and the American dream.
<br>
<br>So there is little room for the luxury of making complaints without making commitments.
<br>
<br>America must enlist the ideals, the energy, the experience, and the skills of its people on a larger scale than it ever has in the past. We must insure that these efforts be used to maximum advantage. We must insure that the desire to serve be linked with the opportunity to serve. We must match the vision of youth with the wisdom of experience. We must apply the understanding gained from foreign service to domestic needs, and we must extend what we learn in domestic service to other nations. And in all these endeavors, I believe, we can bring the power seen from afar to focus clearly on the problems and the promise of our time.

<br>Message of the President
<br>
<br>To the Congress of the United States:
<br>
<br>On January 5 I announced a three-part program to streamline the executive branch of the Federal Government. By concentrating less responsibility in the President's immediate staff and more in the hands of the departments and agencies, this program should significantly improve the services of the Government. I believe these reforms have become so urgently necessary that I intend, with the cooperation of the Congress, to pursue them with all of the resources of my office during the coming year.
<br>
<br>The first part of this program is a renewed drive to achieve passage of my legislative proposals to overhaul the Cabinet departments. Secondly, I have appointed three Cabinet Secretaries as Counsellors to the President with coordinating responsibilities in the broad areas of human resources, natural resources, and community development, and five Assistants to the President with special responsibilities in the areas of domestic affairs, economic affairs, foreign affairs, executive management, and operations of the White House.
<br>
<br>The third part of this program is a sharp reduction in the overall size of the Executive Office of the President and a reorientation of that office back to its original mission as a staff for top-level policy formation and monitoring of policy execution in broad functional areas. The Executive Office of the President should no longer be encumbered with the task of managing or administering programs which can be run more effectively by the departments and agencies. I have therefore concluded that a number of specialized operational and program functions should be shifted out of the Executive Office into the line departments and agencies of the Government. Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1973, transmitted herewith, would effect such changes with respect to emergency preparedness functions and scientific and technological affairs.
<br>STREAMLINING THE FEDERAL SCIENCE ESTABLISHMENT
<br>
<br>When the National Science Foundation was established by an act of the Congress in 1950, its statutory responsibilities included evaluation of the Government's scientific research programs and development of basic science policy. In the late 1950's however, with the effectiveness of the U.S. science effort under serious scrutiny as a result of sputnik, the post of Science Advisor to the President was established. The White House became increasingly involved in the evaluation and coordination of research and development programs and in science policy matters, and that involvement was institutionalized in 1962 when a reorganization plan established the Office of Science and Technology within the Executive Office of the President, through transfer of authorities formerly vested in the National Science Foundation.
<br>
<br>With advice and assistance from OST during the past decade, the scientific and technological capability of the Government has been markedly strengthened. This administration is firmly committed to sustained, broad-based national effort in science and technology, as I made plain last year in the first special message on the subject ever sent by a President to the Congress. The research and development capability of the various executive departments and agencies, civilian as well as defense, has been upgraded. The National Science Foundation has broadened from its earlier concentration on basic research support to take on a significant role in applied research as well. It has matured in its ability to play a coordinating and evaluative role within the Government and between the public and private sectors.
<br>
<br>I have therefore concluded that it is timely and appropriate to transfer to the Director of the National Science Foundation all functions presently vested in the Office of Science and Technology, and to abolish that office. Reorganization Plan No. 1 would effect these changes.
<br>
<br>The multi-disciplinary staff resources of the Foundation will provide analytic capabilities for performance of the transferred functions. In addition, the Director of the Foundation will be able to draw on expertise from all of the Federal agencies, as well as from outside the Government, for assistance in carrying out his new responsibilities.
<br>
<br>It is also my intention, after the transfer of responsibilities is effected, to ask Dr. H. Guyford Stever, the current Director of the Foundation, to take on the additional post of Science Adviser. In this capacity, he would advise and assist the White House, Office of Management and Budget, Domestic Council, and other entities within the Executive Office of the President on matters where scientific and technological expertise is called for, and would act as the President's representative in selected cooperative programs in international scientific affairs, including chairing such joint bodies as the U.S.–U.S.S.R. Joint Commission on Scientific and Technical Cooperation.
<br>
<br>In the case of national security, the Department of Defense has strong capabilities for assessing weapons needs and for undertaking new weapons development, and the President will continue to draw primarily on this source for advice regarding military technology. The President in special situations also may seek independent studies or assessments concerning military technology from within or outside the Federal establishment, using the machinery of the National Security Council for this purpose, as well as the Science Adviser when appropriate.
<br>
<br>In one special area of technology—space and aeronautics—a coordinating council has existed within the Executive Office of the President since 1958. This body, the National Aeronautics and Space Council, met a major need during the evolution of our nation's space program. Vice President Agnew has served with distinction as its chairman for the past four years. At my request, beginning in 1969, the Vice President also chaired a special Space Task Group charged with developing strategy alternatives for a balanced U.S. space program in the coming years.
<br>
<br>As a result of this work, basic policy issues in the United States space effort have been resolved, and the necessary interagency relationships have been established. I have therefore concluded, with the Vice President's concurrence, that the Council can be discontinued. Needed policy coordination can now be achieved through the resources of the executive departments and agencies, such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, augmented by some of the former Council staff. Accordingly, my reorganization plan proposes the abolition of the National Aeronautics and Space Council.
<br>A NEW APPROACH TO EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS
<br>
<br>The organization within the Executive Office of the President which has been known in recent years as the Office of Emergency Preparedness dates back, through its numerous predecessor agencies, more than 20 years. It has performed valuable functions in developing plans for emergency preparedness, in administering Federal disaster relief, and in overseeing and assisting the agencies in this area.
<br>
<br>OEP's work as a coordinating and supervisory authority in this field has in fact been so effective—particularly under the leadership of General George A. Lincoln, its director for the past four years, who retired earlier this month after an exceptional military and public service career—that the line departments and agencies which in the past have shared in the performance of the various preparedness functions now possess the capability to assume full responsibility for those functions. In the interest of efficiency and economy, we can now further streamline the Executive Office of the President by formally relocating those responsibilities and closing the Office of Emergency Preparedness.
<br>
<br>I propose to accomplish this reform in two steps. First, Reorganization Plan No. 1 would transfer to the President all functions previously vested by law in the Office or its Director, except the Director's role as a member of the National Security Council, which would be abolished; and it would abolish the Office of Emergency Preparedness.
<br>
<br>The functions to be transferred to the President from OEP are largely incidental to emergency authorities already vested in him. They include functions under the Disaster Relief Act of 1970 [former 42 U.S.C. 4401 et seq.]; the function of determining whether a major disaster has occurred within the meaning of (1) Section 7 of the Act of September 30, 1950, as amended, 20 U.S.C. 241–1, or (2) Section 762(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as added by Section 161(a) of the Education Amendments of 1972, Public Law 92–318, 86 Stat. 288 at 299 (relating to the furnishing by the Commissioner of Education of disaster relief assistance for educational purposes) [former 20 U.S.C. 1132d–1]; and functions under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862), with respect to the conduct of investigations to determine the effects on national security of the importation of certain articles.
<br>
<br>The Civil Defense Advisory Council within OEP would also be abolished by this plan, as changes in domestic and international conditions since its establishment in 1950 have now obviated the need for a standing council of this type. Should advice of the kind the Council has provided be required again in the future, State and local officials and experts in the field can be consulted on an ad hoc basis.
<br>
<br>Second, as soon as the plan became effective, I would delegate OEP's former functions as follows:
<br>
<br>All OEP responsibilities having to do with preparedness for and relief of civil emergencies and disasters would be transferred to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This would provide greater field capabilities for coordination of Federal disaster assistance with that provided by States and local communities, and would be in keeping with the objective of creating a broad, new Department of Community Development.
<br>
<br>OEP's responsibilities for measures to ensure the continuity of civil government operations in the event of major military attack would be reassigned to the General Services Administration, as would responsibility for resource mobilization including the management of national security stockpiles, with policy guidance in both cases to be provided by the National Security Council, and with economic considerations relating to changes in stockpile levels to be coordinated by the Council on Economic Policy.
<br>
<br>Investigations of imports which might threaten the national security—assigned to OEP by Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 [19 U.S.C. 1862]—would be reassigned to the Treasury Department, whose other trade studies give it a readymade capability in this field; the National Security Council would maintain its supervisory role over strategic imports.
<br>
<br>Those disaster relief authorities which have been reserved to the President in the past, such as the authority to declare major disasters, will continue to be exercised by him under these new arrangements. In emergency situations calling for rapid interagency coordination, the Federal response will be coordinated by the Executive Office of the President under the general supervision of the Assistant to the President in charge of executive management.
<br>
<br>The Oil Policy Committee will continue to function as in the past, unaffected by this reorganization, except that I will designate the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury as chairman in place of the Director of OEP. The committee will operate under the general supervision of the Assistant to the President in charge of economic affairs.
<br>DECLARATIONS
<br>
<br>After investigation, I have found that each action included in the accompanying plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in Section 901(a) of title 5 of the United States Code. In particular, the plan is responsive to the intention of the Congress as expressed in Section 901(a)(1), "to promote better execution of the laws, more effective management of the executive branch and of its agencies and functions, and expeditious administration of the public business;" and in Section 901(a)(3), "to increase the efficiency of the operations of the Government to the fullest extent practicable;" and in Section 901(a)(5), "to reduce the number of agencies by consolidating those having similar functions under a single head, and to abolish such agencies or functions as may not be necessary for the efficient conduct of the Government."
<br>
<br>While it is not practicable to specify all of the expenditure reductions and other economies which will result from the actions proposed, personnel and budget savings from abolition of the National Aeronautics and Space Council and the Office of Science and Technology alone will exceed $2 million annually, and additional savings should result from a reduction of Executive Pay Schedule positions now associated with other transferred and delegated functions.
<br>
<br>The plan has as its one logically consistent subject matter the streamlining of the Executive Office of the President and the disposition of major responsibilities currently conducted in the Executive Office of the President, which can better be performed elsewhere or abolished.
<br>
<br>The functions which would be abolished by this plan, and the statutory authorities for each, are:
<br>
<br>(1) the functions of the Director of the Office of Emergency Preparedness with respect to being a member of the National Security Council (Sec. 101, National Security Act of 1947, as amended, 50 U.S.C. 402; and Sec. 4, Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1958);
<br>
<br>(2) the functions of the Civil Defense Advisory Council (Sec. 102(a) Federal Civil Defense Act of 1950; 50 U.S.C. App. 2272(a)); and
<br>
<br>(3) the functions of the National Aeronautics and Space Council (Sec. 201, National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958; 42 U.S.C. 2471).
<br>
<br>The proposed reorganization is a necessary part of the restructuring of the Executive Office of the President. It would provide through the Director of the National Science Foundation a strong focus for Federal efforts to encourage the development and application of science and technology to meet national needs. It would mean better preparedness for and swifter response to civil emergencies, and more reliable precautions against threats to the national security. The leaner and less diffuse Presidential staff structure which would result would enhance the President's ability to do his job and would advance the interests of the Congress as well.
<br>
<br>I am confident that this reorganization plan would significantly increase the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the Federal Government. I urge the Congress to allow it to become effective.

<br>Message of the President
<br>
<br>To the Congress of the United States:
<br>
<br>Drug abuse is one of the most vicious and corrosive forces attacking the foundations of American society today. It is a major cause of crime and a merciless destroyer of human lives. We must fight it with all of the resources at our command.
<br>
<br>This Administration has declared all-out, global war on the drug menace. As I reported to the Congress earlier this month in my State of the Union message, there is evidence of significant progress on a number of fronts in that war.
<br>
<br>Both the rate of new addiction to heroin and the number of narcotic-related deaths showed an encouraging downturn last year. More drug addicts and abusers are in treatment and rehabilitation programs than ever before.
<br>
<br>Progress in pinching off the supply of illicit drugs was evident in last year's stepped-up volume of drug seizures worldwide—which more than doubled in 1972 over the 1971 level.
<br>
<br>Arrests of traffickers have risen by more than one-third since 1971. Prompt Congressional action on my proposal for mandatory minimum sentences for pushers of hard drugs will help ensure that convictions stemming from such arrests lead to actual imprisonment of the guilty.
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding these gains, much more must be done. The resilience of the international drug trade remains grimly impressive—current estimates suggest that we still intercept only a small fraction of all the heroin and cocaine entering this country. Local police still find that more than one of every three suspects arrested for street crimes is a narcotic abuser or addict. And the total number of Americans addicted to narcotics, suffering terribly themselves and inflicting their suffering on countless others, still stands in the hundreds of thousands.
<br>A UNIFIED COMMAND FOR DRUG ENFORCEMENT
<br>
<br>Seeking ways to intensify our counter-offensive against this menace, I am asking the Congress today to join with this Administration in strengthening and streamlining the Federal drug law enforcement effort.
<br>
<br>Funding for this effort has increased sevenfold during the past five years, from $36 million in fiscal year 1969 to $257 million in fiscal year 1974—more money is not the most pressing enforcement need at present. Nor is there a primary need for more manpower working on the problem, over 2100 new agents having already been added to the Federal drug enforcement agencies under this Administration, an increase of more than 250 percent over the 1969 level.
<br>
<br>The enforcement work could benefit significantly, however, from consolidation of our anti-drug forces under a single unified command. Right now the Federal Government is fighting the war on drug abuse under a distinct handicap, for its efforts are those of a loosely confederated alliance facing a resourceful, elusive, worldwide enemy. Admiral Mahan, the master naval strategist, described this handicap precisely when he wrote that "Granting the same aggregate of force, it is never as great in two hands as in one, because it is not perfectly concentrated."
<br>
<br>More specifically, the drug law enforcement activities of the United States now are not merely in two hands but in half a dozen. Within the Department of Justice, with no overall direction below the level of the Attorney General, these fragmented forces include the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, the Office for Drug Abuse Law Enforcement, the Office of National Narcotics Intelligence, and certain activities of the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration. The Treasury Department is also heavily engaged in enforcement work through the Bureau of Customs.
<br>
<br>This aggregation of Federal activities has grown up rapidly over the past few years in response to the urgent need for stronger anti-drug measures. It has enabled us to make a very encouraging beginning in the accelerated drug enforcement drive of this Administration.
<br>
<br>But it also has serious operational and organizational shortcomings. Certainly the cold-blooded underworld networks that funnel narcotics from suppliers all over the world into the veins of American drug victims are no respecters of the bureaucratic dividing lines that now complicate our anti-drug efforts. On the contrary, these modern-day slave traders can derive only advantage from the limitations of the existing organizational patchwork. Experience has now given us a good basis for correcting those limitations, and it is time to do so.
<br>
<br>I therefore propose creation of a single, comprehensive Federal agency within the Department of Justice to lead the war against illicit drug traffic.
<br>
<br>Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1973, which I am transmitting to the Congress with this message, would establish such an agency, to be called the Drug Enforcement Administration. It would be headed by an Administrator reporting directly to the Attorney General.
<br>
<br>The Drug Enforcement Administration would carry out the following anti-drug functions, and would absorb the associated manpower and budgets:
<br>
<br>—All functions of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (which would be abolished as a separate entity by the reorganization plan);
<br>
<br>—Those functions of the Bureau of Customs pertaining to drug investigations and intelligence (to be transferred from the Treasury Department to the Attorney General by the reorganization plan);
<br>
<br>—All functions of the Office for Drug Abuse Law Enforcement; and
<br>
<br>—All functions of the Office of National Narcotics Intelligence.
<br>
<br>Merger of the latter two organizations into the new agency would be effected by an executive order dissolving them and transferring their functions, to take effect upon approval of Reorganization Plan No. 2 by the Congress. Drug law enforcement research currently funded by the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration and other agencies would also be transferred to the new agency by executive action.
<br>
<br>The major responsibilities of the Drug Enforcement Administration would thus include:
<br>
<br>—development of overall Federal drug law enforcement strategy, programs, planning, and evaluation;
<br>
<br>—full investigation and preparation for prosecution of suspects for violations under all Federal drug trafficking laws;
<br>
<br>—full investigation and preparation for prosecution of suspects connected with illicit drugs seized at U.S. ports-of-entry and international borders;
<br>
<br>—conduct of all relations with drug law enforcement officials of foreign governments, under the policy guidance of the Cabinet Committee on International Narcotics Control;
<br>
<br>—full coordination and cooperation with State and local law enforcement officials on joint drug enforcement efforts; and
<br>
<br>—regulation of the legal manufacture of drugs and other controlled substances under Federal regulations.
<br>
<br>The Attorney General, working closely with the Administrator of this new agency, would have authority to make needed program adjustments. He would take steps within the Department of Justice to ensure that high priority emphasis is placed on the prosecution and sentencing of drug traffickers following their apprehension by the enforcement organization. He would also have the authority and responsibility for securing the fullest possible cooperation—particularly with respect to collection of drug intelligence—from all Federal departments and agencies which can contribute to the anti-drug work, including the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
<br>
<br>My proposals would make possible a more effective anti-drug role for the FBI, especially in dealing with the relationship between drug trafficking and organized crime. I intend to see that the resources of the FBI are fully committed to assist in supporting the new Drug Enforcement Administration.
<br>
<br>The consolidation effected under Reorganization Plan No. 2 would reinforce the basic law enforcement and criminal justice mission of the Department of Justice. With worldwide drug law enforcement responsibilities no longer divided among several organizations in two different Cabinet departments, more complete and cumulative drug law enforcement intelligence could be compiled. Patterns of international and domestic illicit drug production, distribution, and sale could be more directly compared and interpreted. Case-by-case drug law enforcement activities could be more comprehensively linked, cross-referenced, and coordinated into a single, organic enforcement operation. In short, drug law enforcement officers would be able to spend more time going after the traffickers and less time coordinating with one another.
<br>
<br>Such progress could be especially helpful on the international front. Narcotics control action plans, developed under the leadership of the Cabinet Committee on International Narcotics Control, are now being carried out by U.S. officials in cooperation with host governments in 59 countries around the world. This wide-ranging effort to cut off drug supplies before they ever reach U.S. borders or streets is just now beginning to bear fruit. We can enhance its effectiveness, with little disruption of ongoing enforcement activities, by merging both the highly effective narcotics force of overseas Customs agents and the rapidly developing international activities of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs into the Drug Enforcement Administration. The new agency would work closely with the Cabinet Committee under the active leadership of the U.S. Ambassador in each country where anti-drug programs are underway.
<br>
<br>Two years ago, when I established the Special Action Office for Drug Abuse Prevention within the Executive Office of the President, we gained an organization with the necessary resources, breadth, and leadership capacity to begin dealing decisively with the "demand" side of the drug abuse problem—treatment and rehabilitation for those who have been drug victims, and preventive programs for potential drug abusers. This year, by permitting my reorganization proposals to take effect, the Congress can help provide a similar capability on the "supply" side. The proposed Drug Enforcement Administration, working as a team with the Special Action Office, would arm Americans with a potent one-two punch to help us fight back against the deadly menace of drug abuse. I ask full Congressional cooperation in its establishment.
<br>IMPROVING PORT-OF-ENTRY INSPECTIONS
<br>
<br>No heroin or cocaine is produced within the United States; domestic availability of these substances results solely from their illegal importation. The careful and complete inspection of all persons and goods coming into the United States is therefore an integral part of effective Federal drug law enforcement.
<br>
<br>At the present time, however, Federal responsibility for conducting port-of-entry inspections is awkwardly divided among several Cabinet departments. The principal agencies involved are the Treasury Department's Bureau of Customs, which inspects goods, and the Justice Department's Immigration and Naturalization Service, which inspects persons and their papers. The two utilize separate inspection procedures, hold differing views of inspection priorities, and employ dissimilar personnel management practices.
<br>
<br>To reduce the possibility that illicit drugs will escape detection at ports-of-entry because of divided responsibility, and to enhance the effectiveness of the Drug Enforcement Administration, the reorganization plan which I am proposing today would transfer to the Secretary of the Treasury all functions currently vested in Justice Department officials to inspect persons, or the documents of persons.
<br>
<br>When the plan takes effect, it is my intention to direct the Secretary of the Treasury to use the resources so transferred—including some 1,000 employees of the Immigration and Naturalization Service—to augment the staff and budget of the Bureau of Customs. The Bureau's primary responsibilities would then include:
<br>
<br>—inspection of all persons and goods entering the United States;
<br>
<br>—valuation of goods being imported, and assessment of appropriate tariff duties;
<br>
<br>—interception of contraband being smuggled into the United States;
<br>
<br>—enforcement of U.S. laws governing the international movement of goods, except the investigation of contraband drugs and narcotics; and
<br>
<br>—turning over the investigation responsibility for all drug law enforcement cases to the Department of Justice.
<br>
<br>The reorganization would thus group most port-of-entry inspection functions in a single Cabinet department. It would reduce the need for much day-to-day interdepartmental coordination, allow more efficient staffing at some field locations, and remove the basis for damaging inter-agency rivalries. It would also give the Secretary of the Treasury the authority and flexibility to meet changing requirements in inspecting the international flow of people and goods. An important by-product of the change would be more convenient service for travellers entering and leaving the country.
<br>
<br>For these reasons, I am convinced that inspection activities at U.S. ports-of-entry can more effectively support our drug law enforcement efforts if concentrated in a single agency. The processing of persons at ports-of-entry is too closely interrelated with the inspection of goods to remain organizationally separated from it any longer. Both types of inspections have numerous objectives besides drug law enforcement, so it is logical to vest them in the Treasury Department, which has long had the principal responsibility for port-of-entry inspection of goods, including goods being transported in connection with persons. As long as the inspections are conducted with full awareness of related drug concerns it is neither necessary nor desirable that they be made a responsibility of the primary drug enforcement organization.
<br>DECLARATIONS
<br>
<br>After investigation, I have found that each action included in Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1973 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in Section 901(a) of Title 5 of the United States Code. In particular, the plan is responsive to the intention of the Congress as expressed in Section 901(a)(1): "to promote better execution of the laws, more effective management of the executive branch and of its agencies and functions, and expeditious administration of the public business;" Section 901(a)(3): "to increase the efficiency of the operations of the Government to the fullest extent practicable;" Section 901(a)(5): "to reduce the number of agencies by consolidating those having similar functions under a single head, and to abolish such agencies or functions as may not be necessary for the efficient conduct of the Government;" and Section 901(a)(6): "to eliminate overlapping and duplication of effort."
<br>
<br>As required by law, the plan has one logically consistent subject matter: consolidation of Federal drug law enforcement activities in a manner designed to increase their effectiveness.
<br>
<br>The plan would establish in the Department of Justice a new Administration designated as the Drug Enforcement Administration. The reorganizations provided for in the plan make necessary the appointment and compensation of new officers as specified in Section 5 of the plan. The rates of compensation fixed for these officers would be comparable to those fixed for officers in the executive branch who have similar responsibilities.
<br>
<br>While it is not practicable to specify all of the expenditure reductions and other economies which may result from the actions proposed, some savings may be anticipated in administrative costs now associated with the functions being transferred and consolidated.
<br>
<br>The proposed reorganization is a necessary step in upgrading the effectiveness of our Nation's drug law enforcement effort. Both of the proposed changes would build on the strengths of established agencies, yielding maximum gains in the battle against drug abuse with minimum loss of time and momentum in the transition.
<br>
<br>I am confident that this reorganization plan would significantly increase the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the Federal Government. I urge the Congress to allow it to become effective.

<br>[For Executive Orders setting effective dates of various provisions of Reorg. Plan No. 1 of 1977 pursuant to section 7 thereof, and further implementing such Reorg. Plan, see notes set out preceding 3 U.S.C. 101.]
<br>Message of the President
<br>
<br>To the Congress of the United States:
<br>
<br>I herewith transmit my plan for the Reorganization of the Executive Office of the President (EOP), Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1977. This plan is the first of a series I intend to submit under the reorganization authority vested in me by the Reorganization Act of 1977 (Public Law 95–17) [5 U.S.C. 901–912]. It adheres to the purposes set forth in Section 901(a) of the Act [5 U.S.C. 901(a)].
<br>
<br>This plan in conjunction with the other steps I am taking will:
<br>
<br>Eliminate seven of the seventeen units now within the EOP and modify the rest. There were 19 units when I took office; the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board and the Economic Policy Board have already been abolished. Thus with this plan I will have eliminated nine of 19 EOP units.
<br>
<br>Reduce EOP staffing by about 250 which includes the White House staff reduction of 134 or 28 percent which I have already ordered.
<br>
<br>Improve efficiency by centralizing administrative functions; and
<br>
<br>Improve the process by which information is provided for Presidential decisionmaking.
<br>
<br>These recommendations arise from a careful, systematic study of the EOP. They are based on the premise that the EOP exists to serve the President and should be structured to meet his needs. They will reduce waste and cost while improving the service the President, and the nation, receive from the EOP.
<br>
<br>The EOP now consists of the immediate White House Office, the Vice President's Office, the Office of Management and Budget, and fourteen other agencies. The EOP has a budget authority of about $80,000,000 and 1,712 full time employees.
<br>
<br>The White House Office concentrates on close personal support including policy and political advice and administrative and operational services. The Office of the Vice President provides similar support to him. OMB's primary mission is to develop and implement the budget; it also carries out a number of management and reorganization activities.
<br>
<br>Three EOP units have responsibility for policy development:
<br>
<br>National Security Council.
<br>
<br>Domestic Council.
<br>
<br>Council on International Economic Policy.
<br>
<br>The other 11 are more specialized offices that offer analysis and advice, help develop policy in certain areas, or carry out special projects. These are:
<br>
<br>Council of Economic Advisers.
<br>
<br>Council on Wage and Price Stability.
<br>
<br>Office of the Special Representative for Trade Negotiations.
<br>
<br>Council on Environmental Quality.
<br>
<br>Office of Science and Technology Policy.
<br>
<br>Office of Drug Abuse Policy.
<br>
<br>Office of Telecommunications Policy.
<br>
<br>Intelligence Oversight Board.
<br>
<br>Federal Property Council.
<br>
<br>Energy Resources Council.
<br>
<br>Economic Opportunity Council.
<br>
<br>To make the EOP more effective, four steps are necessary:
<br>
<br>I. Strengthen management of policy issues.
<br>
<br>II. Limit the EOP, wherever possible, to functions directly related to the President's work.
<br>
<br>III. Centralize administrative services.
<br>
<br>IV. Reduce size of White House and EOP staffs.
<br>i. strengthen process management of policy issues
<br>
<br>Perhaps the most important function of the President's staff is to make sure he has the wide variety of views and facts he needs to make decisions. By building a more orderly system for collecting information and advice, the President can make sure that he will hear all the views he should—and hear them in time. To better insure that this happens, I am taking the following actions to:
<br>
<br>Institute for domestic and economic issues, a system similar to the Presidential Review Memorandum process currently used for National Security issues.
<br>
<br>Create a committee of Presidential advisers, chaired by the Vice President, to set priorities among issues and oversee their staffing.
<br>
<br>Assure that Presidential decision memoranda on policy issues are coordinated with Cabinet and EOP advisers most involved with the issue.
<br>
<br>Consolidate under the Staff Secretary the two current White House paper circulation systems.
<br>
<br>Appoint a group of advisers to review the decisionmaking process periodically.
<br>
<br>Give the Assistant to the President for Domestic Affairs and Policy clear responsibility for managing the way in which domestic and most economic policy issues are prepared for Presidential decision.
<br>
<br>Assign follow-up responsibility for Presidential decisions as follows: immediate follow-up will be handled by the NSC or Domestic Policy Staff most directly involved in the issue; long term follow-up on selected issues will be handled by the Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental Relations.
<br>
<br>These actions recognize that the White House and Executive Office staff must use their proximity to the President to insure that the full resources of the government and the public are brought to bear on Presidential decisions in a timely fashion. It is my purpose in instituting these changes to strengthen Cabinet participation in Presidential decisions.
<br>ii. rationalize eop structure by limiting eop, wherever possible, to functions which bear a close relationship to the work of the president
<br>
<br>As the President's principal staff institution, there are several major things the EOP must do:
<br>
<br>Provide day-to-day operational support (e.g. scheduling, appointments) and help the President communicate with the public, the Congress, and the press.
<br>
<br>Manage the budget and coordinate Administration positions on matters before the Congress.
<br>
<br>Manage the Presidential decisionmaking processes efficiently and fairly, and bring the President the widest possible range of opinions.
<br>
<br>Help the President: plan and set priorities; monitor and evaluate progress toward achieving the President's objectives; understand and resolve major conflicts among line subordinates; manage crises, especially in national security matters.
<br>
<br>In order to restructure the EOP around these basic functions, the functions of seven units should be discontinued or transferred, and ten units, including the White House Office, should be retained but modified.
<br>
<br>Seven units should be discontinued or their functions transferred. These are:
<br>
<br>1. Office of Drug Abuse Policy.
<br>
<br>2. Office of Telecommunications Policy.
<br>
<br>3. Council on International Economic Policy.
<br>
<br>4. Federal Property Council.
<br>
<br>5. Energy Resources Council.
<br>
<br>6. Economic Opportunity Council.
<br>
<br>7. Domestic Council.
<br>
<br>The functions of the Office of Drug Abuse Policy (ODAP) can be performed by a smaller staff reporting to a Presidential adviser in the EOP. The Office itself will be discontinued.
<br>
<br>Much of the work done by the Office of Telecommunications Policy (OTP) can be more effectively performed outside the EOP. It is important that the EOP have the capacity to resolve differences and that the President have immediate advice on telecommunications and information policy, especially on national security, emergency preparedness and privacy issues. This only requires a small staff within EOP. The Office of Management and Budget would take responsibility for Federal telecommunications procurement and management policy and arbitration of interagency disputes about frequency allocation. All other functions except developing Presidential policy options would be transferred to a new office within the Department of Commerce, headed by a new Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information, who will perform many of the functions previously performed by the head of the OTP.
<br>
<br>I propose that the Economic Opportunity Council be discontinued; it is dormant and its only active function (preparation of the Catalogue of Federal Domestic Assistance) is being performed by OMB. Three other units are also inactive and should be discontinued: Council on International Economic Policy, the Federal Property Council, and the Energy Resources Council.
<br>
<br>The Domestic Council should be abolished. It has rarely functioned as a Council, because it is too large and its membership too diverse to make decisions efficiently. Its functions have been performed entirely by its staff. This Domestic Policy Staff should report to the Assistant to the President for Domestic Affairs and Policy. Under the policy process system described earlier, they should manage the process which coordinates the making of domestic and most economic policy. They should work closely with the Cabinet departments and agencies to insure that the views of the Cabinet and agency heads are brought to the President before decisions are made.
<br>
<br>The ten EOP units which will continue with some modification are:
<br>
<br>1. White House Office.
<br>
<br>2. Office of the Vice President.
<br>
<br>3. Office of Management and Budget.
<br>
<br>4. Council on Environmental Quality.
<br>
<br>5. Council of Economic Advisers.
<br>
<br>6. Office of Science and Technology Policy.
<br>
<br>7. Office of the Special Representative for Trade Negotiations.
<br>
<br>8. National Security Council.
<br>
<br>9. Intelligence Oversight Board.
<br>
<br>10. Council on Wage and Price Stability.
<br>
<br>The operations of the Office of the Vice President reflect the combination of constitutional, statutory, and Presidentially assigned duties that make it unique among EOP units. Because his interests and assignments cover the same range as the President's, the Vice President requires a staff with expertise in diverse areas. Its basic functions should not be changed. However, I propose that certain support functions—involving accounting, personnel services, and supply—be transferred to a centralized EOP Administrative Unit.
<br>
<br>The Office of Management and Budget would remain as a separate entity in the EOP, but some functional changes should be made. Four functions should be transferred from OMB to other parts of the government:
<br>
<br>Administration to the new EOP Central Administrative Unit;
<br>
<br>Executive Department/Labor Relations (except for Pay Agent, Executive Level Pools, and Legislative Analysis) to the Civil Service Commission;
<br>
<br>Advisory Committee Management Secretariat to the General Services Administration;
<br>
<br>Statistical Policy (except Forms Clearance) to the Department of Commerce.
<br>
<br>I have asked the OMB to reorganize its management arm to emphasize major Presidential initiatives, such as reorganization, program evaluation, paperwork reduction, and regulatory reform.
<br>
<br>The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) should remain in the EOP as an environmental adviser to the President. The CEQ's major purpose is to provide an independent assessment of our policies for improving the environment. Toward this end, it will analyze long term trends and conditions in the environment. It will advise OMB on the reorganization of natural resources functions within the Federal Government. The Council will retain the functions it now has under NEPA and Executive Order No. 11514 with the exception of routine review of the adequacy of impact statements and the administrative aspects of their receipt and handling. The EPA will take over CEQ's evaluation responsibility under the Federal Nonnuclear Energy Research Development Act of 1974 [section 5901 et seq. of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare]. The CEQ will continue to review and publish the Annual Report on Environmental Quality.
<br>
<br>The strength of the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) lies in its economic analysis of current policy choices. It also presents objective economic data, makes macroeconomic forecasts, and analyzes economic trends and their impact on the national economy. It will continue with a small reduction in staff.
<br>
<br>The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) should retain those science, engineering, and technology functions which can be so useful in helping the President and his advisers make decisions about policy and budget issues. Instead of the Intergovernmental Science, Engineering, and Technology Advisory Panels, the President should rely on an intergovernmental relations working group, chaired by the Science Adviser. The Federal Coordinating Council on Science and Technology should operate as a sub-Cabinet working group chaired by the Science Adviser. The reorganization work of the President's Committee on Science and Technology would be part of the overall reorganization effort. The responsibility for preparing certain reports should be transferred to the National Science Foundation.
<br>
<br>The proposal places manageable limits on OSTP's broad mandate while emphasizing functions that support the President.
<br>
<br>The Office of the Special Representative for Trade Negotiations (STR) is now operating effectively and will be retained essentially as is. With the difficult negotiations now underway in Geneva, the benefits of transferring the STR to another agency are outweighed by the potential reduction in its effectiveness as an international negotiator.
<br>
<br>The National Security Council (NSC) will be retained in its present form and its staff slightly reduced.
<br>
<br>Intelligence Oversight Board (IOB) should be retained to insure that abuses of the past are not repeated and to emphasize Presidential concerns regarding intelligence issues.
<br>
<br>The Council of Wage and Price Stability (COWPS) is a necessary weapon in the continuing fight against inflation and will be retained. To be sure that its work is closely coordinated with the economic analyses performed by the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), COWPS should be directed by the Chairman of CEA.
<br>iii. centralize administrative functions
<br>
<br>About 380 (22 percent) of the full-time, permanent EOP personnel perform administrative support services in EOP units. Most EOP units besides the White House and OMB are too small to provide a full complement of administrative services. They depend on the White House, OMB, GSA, other federal departments, or several of these sources for many of these services. This approach is inefficient; the quality is uneven and the coordination poor. Some services are duplicated, others inconsistently distributed (excess capacity in some units and deficiencies in others), and most too costly.
<br>
<br>I propose to combine administrative support operations into a Central Administrative Unit in EOP to provide support in administrative services common to all EOP entities. It should be a separate EOP entity because of the need to assure equal access by all other units.
<br>
<br>This consolidation will result in:
<br>
<br>Saving of roughly 40 positions and about $1.1 million improved and more innovative services.
<br>
<br>A focus for monitoring the efficiency and responsibility of administrative services.
<br>
<br>A base for an effective EOP budget/planning system through which the President can manage an integrated EOP rather than a collection of disparate units.
<br>
<br>The EOP has never before been organized as a single, unified entity serving the President. It is only by viewing it as a whole that we can improve efficiency through steps like the Central Administrative Unit.
<br>iv. reduce the size of white house and eop staffs
<br>
<br>I am reducing the White House staff by 28 percent, from the 485 I inherited from my predecessor to 351. This involves cuts in my policy and administrative staffs as well as transfers to the Central Administrative Unit.
<br>
<br>I estimate that this plan and the other steps I am taking will reduce staff levels in the EOP by about 250, from 1,712 full-time permanent positions to about 1,460 and will save the taxpayers at least $6 million.
<br>
<br>As in the rest of the government, I will be reluctant to add staff unless necessary to help me do my job better.
<br>
<br>I ask that you support me in improving the operations of the Executive Office of the President by approving the attached reorganization plan.
<br>
<br>In summary this plan would:
<br>
<br>Abolish the Domestic Council and establish a Domestic Policy Staff.
<br>
<br>Establish within the EOP a Central Administrative Unit.
<br>
<br>Transfer certain functions of the Council on Environmental Quality to the President for redelegation.
<br>
<br>Abolish the Office of Drug Abuse Policy and vest functions in the President for redelegation.
<br>
<br>Abolish the Office of Telecommunications Policy and transfer functions to the Department of Commerce and to the President for redelegation.
<br>
<br>Create an Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information.
<br>
<br>Vest some Office of Science and Technology Policy functions in the President for redelegation.
<br>
<br>Abolish the Economic Opportunity Council and vest those functions in the President for redelegation.
<br>
<br>Transfer the Committee Management Secretariat function of the Office of Management and Budget to the President for redelegation.
<br>
<br>Make other incidental transfers attendant to those mentioned above.
<br>
<br>Each of the changes set forth in the plan accompanying this message is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in Section 901(a) of Title 5 of the United States Code. I have taken care to determine that all functions abolished by the plan are done so only under statutory authority provided by Section 903(b) of Title 5 of the United States Code. The provisions in the plan for the appointment and pay of any head or officer of any agency have been found by me to be necessary.
<br>
<br>As we continue our studies of other parts of the Executive Branch, we will find more ways to improve services in the EOP and elsewhere. This plan is only a beginning, but I am confident that it represents a major step toward a more efficient government that will serve the needs of the people and the President well.

<br>
<br>[Pursuant to Ex. Ord. No. 12048, Mar. 27, 1978, 43 F.R. 13361, this Reorg. Plan is effective July 1, 1978.]
<br>Message of the President
<br>
<br>To the Congress of the United States:
<br>
<br>I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1977 to consolidate certain international communication, educational and cultural, and broadcasting activities of the United States Government. I am acting under the authority vested in me by the Reorganization Act, chapter 9 of title 5 of the United States Code. I am also acting pursuant to section 501 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1978 (Public Law 95–105) [Aug. 17, 1977, 91 Stat. 857], which provides that my recommendations for reorganizing these activities be transmitted by October 31, 1977.
<br>
<br>This reorganization will consolidate into a new agency, to be known as the Agency for International Communication, the functions now exercised by the State Department's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs and the United States Information Agency.
<br>
<br>The principal aspects of this proposal are:
<br>
<br>—The new agency will take over USIA's international communications programs (including the Voice of America) and the international educational and cultural exchange activities now conducted by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs.
<br>
<br>—The agency's Director will be the principal advisor on international information and exchange activities to the President, the National Security Council, and the Secretary of State. Under the direction of the Secretary of State, the Director will have primary responsibility within the Government for the conduct of such activities. The Director, the Deputy Director and the Associate Directors of the new agency will be confirmed by the Senate.
<br>
<br>—The two commissions that now advise USIA and the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs will be combined into a single seven-member commission. Members of this nonpartisan commission will be chosen from fields related to the agency's mission. The commissioners will be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.
<br>
<br>The purpose of this reorganization is to broaden our informational, educational and cultural intercourse with the world, since this is the major means by which our government can inform others about our country, and inform ourselves about the rest of the world.
<br>
<br>The new Agency for International Communication will play a central role in building these two-way bridges of understanding between our people and the other peoples of the world. Only by knowing and understanding each other's experiences can we find common ground on which we can examine and resolve our differences.
<br>
<br>The new agency will have two distinct but related goals:
<br>
<br>To tell the world about our society and policies—in particular our commitment to cultural diversity and individual liberty.
<br>
<br>To tell ourselves about the world, so as to enrich our own culture as well as to give us the understanding to deal effectively with problems among nations.
<br>
<br>As the world becomes more and more interdependent, such mutual understanding becomes increasingly vital. The aim of this reorganization, therefore, is a more effective dialogue among peoples of the earth. Americans—mostly immigrants or the descendants of immigrants—are particularly well suited to enter into such an undertaking. We have already learned much from those who have brought differing values, perspectives and experiences to our shores. And we must continue to learn.
<br>
<br>Thus the new agency will lay heavy emphasis on listening to others, so as to learn something of their motivations and aspirations, their histories and cultures.
<br>
<br>Several principles guided me in shaping this reorganization plan. Among the most important were:

<br>—Maintaining the integrity of the educational and cultural exchange programs is imperative. To this end, the plan retains the Board of Foreign Scholarships, whose strong leadership has done so much to insure the high quality of the educational exchange program. In addition, I intend to nominate an Associate Director who will be responsible for the administration and supervision of educational and cultural functions consolidated in the new Agency. The responsibilities presently exercised by the Department of State in relation to the Center for Technical and Cultural Interchange Between East and West, Inc., will be transferred to the new agency without alteration.
<br>
<br>—Keeping the Voice of America's news gathering and reporting functions independent and objective. The Voice's charter, enacted into law in 1976, provides that "VOA news will be accurate, objective, and comprehensive"; that VOA will "present a balanced and comprehensive projection of significant American thought and institutions"; and that VOA will present U.S. policies "clearly and effectively, and will also present responsible discussion and opinion on these policies." Under this Administration, VOA will be solely responsible for the content of news broadcasts—for there is no more valued coin than candor in the international marketplace of ideas. I also plan to nominate an Associate Director who will be responsible for the administration and supervision of the Voice of America.
<br>
<br>—The new agency's activities must be straightforward, open, candid, balanced, and representative. They will not be given over to the advancement of the views of any one group, any one party or any one Administration. The agency must not operate in a covert, manipulative or propagandistic way.
<br>
<br>—Rights of U.S. Information Agency and State Department employees must be respected. In the new agency, their career achievements will be recognized and the best possible use made of their professional skills and abilities.
<br>
<br>The Director of the new agency will assess and advise on the impact on worldwide public opinion of American foreign policy decisions. The Agency will coordinate the international information, educational, cultural and exchange programs conducted by the U.S. Government and will be a governmental focal point for private U.S. international exchange programs. It will also play a leading role within the U.S. Government in our efforts to remove barriers to the international exchange of ideas and information.
