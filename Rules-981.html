<br>
<br>(ii) if the primary source of lending capital for such lender is derived from the sale of bonds, and the constitution of the appropriate State prohibits a pledge of such State's credit as security against such bonds, the day which is one year after such 90th day.

<br>
<br>(ii) during any other period, by crediting such excess interest to the reduction of principal to the extent provided in paragraph (5) of this subsection.
<br>(2) Amount of adjustment for 10 percent loans
<br>
<br>The amount of any adjustment of interest on a loan to be made under this subsection for any quarter shall be equal to—

<br>
<br>Any adjustment amount computed pursuant to paragraphs (2) and (4) of this subsection for any quarter shall be credited, by the holder of the loan on the last day of the calendar year in which such quarter falls, to the loan account of the borrower so as to reduce the principal balance of such account. No such credit shall be made to the loan account of a borrower who on the last day of the calendar year is delinquent for more than 30 days in making a required payment on the loan, but the excess interest shall be calculated and credited to the Secretary. Any credit which is to be made to a borrower's account pursuant to this subsection shall be made effective commencing no later than 30 days following the last day of the calendar year in which the quarter falls for which the credit is being made. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require refunding any repayment of a loan. At the option of the lender, the amount of such adjustment may be distributed to the borrower either by reduction in the amount of the periodic payment on loan, by reducing the number of payments that shall be made with respect to the loan, or by reducing the amount of the final payment of the loan. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require the lender to make additional disclosures pursuant to section 1083(b) of this title.

The notice shall advise the borrower that such rate shall be calculated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph and shall provide the borrower with a substantially equivalent benefit as the adjustment otherwise provided for under this subsection. Such notice may be incorporated into the disclosure required under section 1083(b) of this title if such disclosure has not been previously made.
<br>
<br>(D) The interest rate on a loan converted to a variable rate pursuant to this paragraph shall not exceed the maximum interest rate applicable to the loan prior to such conversion.

<br>§1078. Federal payments to reduce student interest costs
<br>(a) Federal interest subsidies
<br>(1) Types of loans that qualify
<br>
<br>Each student who has received a loan for study at an eligible institution for which the first disbursement is made before July 1, 2010, and—
<br>
<br>(A) which is insured by the Secretary under this part; or
<br>
<br>(B) which is insured under a program of a State or of a nonprofit private institution or organization which was contracted for, and paid to the student, within the period specified in paragraph (5), and which—
<br>
<br>(i) in the case of a loan insured prior to July 1, 1967, was made by an eligible lender and is insured under a program which meets the requirements of subparagraph (E) of subsection (b)(1) and provides that repayment of such loan shall be in installments beginning not earlier than 60 days after the student ceases to pursue a course of study (as described in subparagraph (D) of subsection (b)(1)) at an eligible institution, or
<br>
<br>(ii) in the case of a loan insured after June 30, 1967, was made by an eligible lender and is insured under a program covered by an agreement made pursuant to subsection (b),
<br>
<br>shall be entitled to have paid on his or her behalf and for his or her account to the holder of the loan a portion of the interest on such loan under circumstances described in paragraph (2).
<br>(2) Additional requirements to receive subsidy
<br>
<br>(A) Each student qualifying for a portion of an interest payment under paragraph (1) shall—
<br>
<br>(i) have provided to the lender a statement from the eligible institution, at which the student has been accepted for enrollment, or at which the student is in attendance, which—
<br>
<br>(I) sets forth the loan amount for which the student shows financial need; and
<br>
<br>(II) sets forth a schedule for disbursement of the proceeds of the loan in installments, consistent with the requirements of section 1078–7 of this title;
<br>
<br>(ii) meet the requirements of subparagraph (B); and
<br>
<br>(iii) have provided to the lender at the time of application for a loan made, insured, or guaranteed under this part, the student's driver's number, if any.
<br>
<br>(B) For the purpose of clause (ii) of subparagraph (A), a student shall qualify for a portion of an interest payment under paragraph (1) if the eligible institution has determined and documented the student's amount of need for a loan based on the student's estimated cost of attendance, estimated financial assistance, and, for the purpose of an interest payment pursuant to this section, expected family contribution (as determined under part F), subject to the provisions of subparagraph (D).
<br>
<br>(C) For the purpose of this paragraph—
<br>
<br>(i) a student's cost of attendance shall be determined under section 1087ll of this title;
<br>
<br>(ii) a student's estimated financial assistance means, for the period for which the loan is sought—
<br>
<br>(I) the amount of assistance such student will receive under subpart 1 of part A of this subchapter (as determined in accordance with section 1091(b) of this title), subpart 3 of part A of this subchapter, and parts C and E; plus
<br>
<br>(II) other scholarship, grant, or loan assistance, but excluding—
<br>
<br>(aa) any national service education award or post-service benefit under title I of the National and Community Service Act of 1990 [42 U.S.C. 12511 et seq.]; and
<br>
<br>(bb) any veterans' education benefits as defined in section 1087vv(c) of this title; and
<br>
<br>(iii) the determination of need and of the amount of a loan by an eligible institution under subparagraph (B) with respect to a student shall be calculated in accordance with part F.
<br>
<br>(D) An eligible institution may not, in carrying out the provisions of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph, provide a statement which certifies the eligibility of any student to receive any loan under this part in excess of the maximum amount applicable to such loan.
<br>
<br>(E) For the purpose of subparagraphs (B) and (C) of this paragraph, any loan obtained by a student under section 1078–1 1 or 1078–8 of this title or a parent under section 1078–2 of this title or under any State-sponsored or private loan program for an academic year for which the determination is made may be used to offset the expected family contribution of the student for that year.
<br>(3) Amount of interest subsidy
<br>
<br>(A)(i) Subject to section 1087–1(c) of this title, the portion of the interest on a loan which a student is entitled to have paid, on behalf of and for the account of the student, to the holder of the loan pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be equal to the total amount of the interest on the unpaid principal amount of the loan—
<br>
<br>(I) which accrues prior to the date the student ceases to carry at least one-half the normal full-time academic workload (as determined by the institution), or
<br>
<br>(II) which accrues during a period in which principal need not be paid (whether or not such principal is in fact paid) by reason of a provision described in subsection (b)(1)(M) of this section or in section 1077(a)(2)(C) of this title.
<br>
<br>(ii) Such portion of the interest on a loan shall not exceed, for any period, the amount of the interest on that loan which is payable by the student after taking into consideration the amount of any interest on that loan which the student is entitled to have paid on his or her behalf for that period under any State or private loan insurance program.
<br>
<br>(iii) The holder of a loan with respect to which payments are required to be made under this section shall be deemed to have a contractual right, as against the United States, to receive from the Secretary the portion of interest which has been so determined without administrative delay after the receipt by the Secretary of an accurate and complete request for payment pursuant to paragraph (4).
<br>
<br>(iv) The Secretary shall pay this portion of the interest to the holder of the loan on behalf of and for the account of the borrower at such times as may be specified in regulations in force when the applicable agreement entered into pursuant to subsection (b) was made, or, if the loan was made by a State or is insured under a program which is not covered by such an agreement, at such times as may be specified in regulations in force at the time the loan was paid to the student.
<br>
<br>(v) A lender may not receive interest on a loan for any period that precedes the date that is—
<br>
<br>(I) in the case of a loan disbursed by check, 10 days before the first disbursement of the loan;
<br>
<br>(II) in the case of a loan disbursed by electronic funds transfer, 3 days before the first disbursement of the loan; or
<br>
<br>(III) in the case of a loan disbursed through an escrow agent, 3 days before the first disbursement of the loan.
<br>
<br>(B) If—
<br>
<br>(i) a State student loan insurance program is covered by an agreement under subsection (b),
<br>
<br>(ii) a statute of such State limits the interest rate on loans insured by such program to a rate which is less than the applicable interest rate under this part, and
<br>
<br>(iii) the Secretary determines that subsection (d) does not make such statutory limitation inapplicable and that such statutory limitation threatens to impede the carrying out of the purpose of this part,
<br>
<br>then the Secretary may pay an administrative cost allowance to the holder of each loan which is insured under such program and which is made during the period beginning on the 60th day after October 16, 1968, and ending 120 days after the adjournment of such State's first regular legislative session which adjourns after January 1, 1969. Such administrative cost allowance shall be paid over the term of the loan in an amount per year (determined by the Secretary) which shall not exceed 1 percent of the unpaid principal balance of the loan.
<br>(4) Submission of statements by holders on amount of payment
<br>
<br>Each holder of a loan with respect to which payments of interest are required to be made by the Secretary shall submit to the Secretary, at such time or times and in such manner as the Secretary may prescribe, statements containing such information as may be required by or pursuant to regulation for the purpose of enabling the Secretary to determine the amount of the payment which he must make with respect to that loan.
<br>(5) Duration of authority to make interest subsidized loans
<br>
<br>The period referred to in subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) of this subsection shall begin on November 8, 1965, and end at the close of June 30, 2010.
<br>(6) Assessment of borrower's financial condition not prohibited or required
<br>
<br>Nothing in this chapter or any other Act shall be construed to prohibit or require, unless otherwise specifically provided by law, a lender to evaluate the total financial situation of a student making application for a loan under this part, or to counsel a student with respect to any such loan, or to make a decision based on such evaluation and counseling with respect to the dollar amount of any such loan.
<br>(7) Loans that have not been consummated
<br>
<br>Lenders may not charge interest or receive interest subsidies or special allowance payments for loans for which the disbursement checks have not been cashed or for which electronic funds transfers have not been completed.
<br>(b) Insurance program agreements to qualify loans for interest subsidies
