<br>In paragraph (1)(A), the words "an Executive agency or part thereof" are coextensive with and substituted for "any executive department, commission, council, independent establishment, Government corporation, board, bureau, division, service, . . . authority, administration, or other establishment, in the executive branch of the Government" and to conform to the definition in section 105.
<br>
<br>In paragraph (1)(B), the words "an office or officer in the civil service or uniformed services in or under an Executive agency" are substituted for "office, officer, . . . in the executive branch of the Government" to conform to the definitions in sections 105, 2101, and 2104.

<br>1967 Act
<br>
<br>This section amends section 902 of title 5, United States Code, so as to preserve the application of the source statute for section 902 (sec. 7 of the Reorganization Act of 1949). In the codification of title 5 by Public Law 89–554, that application was inadvertently restricted due to the operation of section 2104 of title 5, providing a title-wide definition of "officer." Briefly, that section defines "officer" as a civil appointive officer of the Federal Government. In the Reorganization Act of 1949, the word "officer" was not defined, and has been construed to include not only civil appointive officers, but uniformed officers, the President, and officers of the government of the District of Columbia. Thus, this section amends section 902 of title 5 by inserting a paragraph providing that the title-wide definition of officer is inapplicable to chapter 9 of title 5. Also, paragraph (1)(B) of section 902 is amended so that the wording thereof is identical to that formerly appearing in section 7 of the Reorganization Act of 1949.

<br>§903. Reorganization plans
<br>
<br>(a) Whenever the President, after investigation, finds that changes in the organization of agencies are necessary to carry out any policy set forth in section 901(a) of this title, he shall prepare a reorganization plan specifying the reorganizations he finds are necessary. Any plan may provide for—
<br>
<br>(1) the transfer of the whole or a part of an agency, or of the whole or a part of the functions thereof, to the jurisdiction and control of another agency;
<br>
<br>(2) the abolition of all or a part of the functions of an agency, except that no enforcement function or statutory program shall be abolished by the plan;
<br>
<br>(3) the consolidation or coordination of the whole or a part of an agency, or of the whole or a part of the functions thereof, with the whole or a part of another agency or the functions thereof;
<br>
<br>(4) the consolidation or coordination of part of an agency or the functions thereof with another part of the same agency or the functions thereof;
<br>
<br>(5) the authorization of an officer to delegate any of his functions; or
<br>
<br>(6) the abolition of the whole or a part of an agency which agency or part does not have, or on the taking effect of the reorganization plan will not have, any functions.
<br>
<br>The President shall transmit the plan (bearing an identification number) to the Congress together with a declaration that, with respect to each reorganization included in the plan, he has found that the reorganization is necessary to carry out any policy set forth in section 901(a) of this title.
<br>
<br>(b) The President shall have a reorganization plan delivered to both Houses on the same day and to each House while it is in session, except that no more than three plans may be pending before the Congress at one time. In his message transmitting a reorganization plan, the President shall specify with respect to each abolition of a function included in the plan the statutory authority for the exercise of the function. The message shall also estimate any reduction or increase in expenditures (itemized so far as practicable), and describe any improvements in management, delivery of Federal services, execution of the laws, and increases in efficiency of Government operations, which it is expected will be realized as a result of the reorganizations included in the plan. In addition, the President's message shall include an implementation section which shall (1) describe in detail (A) the actions necessary or planned to complete the reorganization, (B) the anticipated nature and substance of any orders, directives, and other administrative and operational actions which are expected to be required for completing or implementing the reorganization, and (C) any preliminary actions which have been taken in the implementation process, and (2) contain a projected timetable for completion of the implementation process. The President shall also submit such further background or other information as the Congress may require for its consideration of the plan.
<br>
<br>(c) Any time during the period of 60 calendar days of continuous session of Congress after the date on which the plan is transmitted to it, but before any resolution described in section 909 has been ordered reported in either House, the President may make amendments or modifications to the plan, consistent with sections 903–905 of this title, which modifications or revisions shall thereafter be treated as a part of the reorganization plan originally transmitted and shall not affect in any way the time limits otherwise provided for in this chapter. The President may withdraw the plan any time prior to the conclusion of 90 calendar days of continuous session of Congress following the date on which the plan is submitted to Congress.

<br>Ratification and Affirmation of Prior Reorganization Plans as Law; Actions Taken Pursuant to Such Plans
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 98–532, Oct. 19, 1984, 98 Stat. 2705, provided that:
<br>
<br>"Section 1. The Congress hereby ratifies and affirms as law each reorganization plan that has, prior to the date of enactment of this Act [Oct. 19, 1984], been implemented pursuant to the provisions of chapter 9 of title 5, United States Code, or any predecessor Federal reorganization statute.
<br>
<br>"Sec. 2. Any actions taken prior to the date of enactment of this Act [Oct. 19, 1984] pursuant to a reorganization plan that is ratified and affirmed by section 1 shall be considered to have been taken pursuant to a reorganization expressly approved by Act of Congress."
<br>§907. Effect on other laws, pending legal proceedings, and unexpended appropriations
<br>
<br>(a) A statute enacted, and a regulation or other action made, prescribed, issued, granted, or performed in respect of or by an agency or function affected by a reorganization under this chapter, before the effective date of the reorganization, has, except to the extent rescinded, modified, superseded, or made inapplicable by or under authority of law or by the abolition of a function, the same effect as if the reorganization had not been made. However, if the statute, regulation, or other action has vested the functions in the agency from which it is removed under the reorganization plan, the function, insofar as it is to be exercised after the plan becomes effective, shall be deemed as vested in the agency under which the function is placed by the plan.
<br>
<br>(b) For the purpose of subsection (a) of this section, "regulation or other action" means a regulation, rule, order, policy, determination, directive, authorization, permit, privilege, requirement, designation, or other action.
<br>
<br>(c) A suit, action, or other proceeding lawfully commenced by or against the head of an agency or other officer of the United States, in his official capacity or in relation to the discharge of his official duties, does not abate by reason of the taking effect of a reorganization plan under this chapter. On motion or supplemental petition filed at any time within twelve months after the reorganization plan takes effect, showing a necessity for a survival of the suit, action, or other proceeding to obtain a settlement of the questions involved, the court may allow the suit, action, or other proceeding to be maintained by or against the successor of the head or officer under the reorganization effected by the plan or, if there is no successor, against such agency or officer as the President designates.
<br>
<br>(d) The appropriations or portions of appropriations unexpended by reason of the operation of the chapter may not be used for any purpose, but shall revert to the Treasury.
