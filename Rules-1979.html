<br>(I) Payment conditioned on delivery
<br>
<br>The contract shall provide that no payment may be made until delivery of a portion, acceptable to the Secretary, of the total number of units contracted for, except that, notwithstanding any other provision of law, the contract may provide that, if the Secretary determines (in the Secretary's discretion) that an advance payment, partial payment for significant milestones, or payment to increase manufacturing capacity is necessary to ensure success of a project, the Secretary shall pay an amount, not to exceed 10 percent of the contract amount, in advance of delivery. The Secretary shall, to the extent practicable, make the determination of advance payment at the same time as the issuance of a solicitation. The contract shall provide that such advance payment is required to be repaid if there is a failure to perform by the vendor under the contract. The contract may also provide for additional advance payments of 5 percent each for meeting the milestones specified in such contract, except that such payments shall not exceed 50 percent of the total contract amount. If the specified milestones are reached, the advanced payments of 5 percent shall not be required to be repaid. Nothing in this subclause shall be construed as affecting the rights of vendors under provisions of law or regulation (including the Federal Acquisition Regulation) relating to the termination of contracts for the convenience of the Government.
<br>(II) Discounted payment
<br>
<br>The contract may provide for a discounted price per unit of a product that is not licensed, cleared, or approved as described in paragraph (1)(B)(i)(III)(aa) at the time of delivery, and may provide for payment of an additional amount per unit if the product becomes so licensed, cleared, or approved before the expiration date of the contract (including an additional amount per unit of product delivered before the effective date of such licensing, clearance, or approval).
<br>(III) Contract duration
<br>
<br>The contract shall be for a period not to exceed five years, except that, in first awarding the contract, the Secretary may provide for a longer duration, not exceeding 10 years, if the Secretary determines that complexities or other difficulties in performance under the contract justify such a period. The contract shall be renewable for additional periods, none of which shall exceed five years. The Secretary shall notify the vendor within 90 days of a determination by the Secretary to renew, extend, or terminate such contract.
<br>(IV) Storage by vendor
<br>
<br>The contract may provide that the vendor will provide storage for stocks of a product delivered to the ownership of the Federal Government under the contract, for such period and under such terms and conditions as the Secretary may specify, and in such case amounts from the special reserve fund as defined in subsection (h) shall be available for costs of shipping, handling, storage, and related costs for such product.
<br>(V) Product approval
<br>
<br>The contract shall provide that the vendor seek approval, clearance, or licensing of the product from the Secretary; for a timetable for the development of data and other information to support such approval, clearance, or licensing; and that the Secretary may waive part or all of this contract term on request of the vendor or on the initiative of the Secretary.
<br>(VI) Non-stockpile transfers of security countermeasures
<br>
<br>The contract shall provide that the vendor will comply with all applicable export-related controls with respect to such countermeasure.
<br>(VII) Sales exclusivity
<br>
<br>The contract may provide that the vendor is the exclusive supplier of the product to the Federal Government for a specified period of time, not to exceed the term of the contract, on the condition that the vendor is able to satisfy the needs of the Government. During the agreed period of sales exclusivity, the vendor shall not assign its rights of sales exclusivity to another entity or entities without approval by the Secretary. Such a sales exclusivity provision in such a contract shall constitute a valid basis for a sole source procurement under section 3304(a)(1) of title 41.
<br>(VIII) Warm based surge capacity
<br>
<br>The contract may provide that the vendor establish domestic manufacturing capacity of the product to ensure that additional production of the product is available in the event that the Secretary determines that there is a need to quickly purchase additional quantities of the product. Such contract may provide a fee to the vendor for establishing and maintaining such capacity in excess of the initial requirement for the purchase of the product. Additionally, the cost of maintaining the domestic manufacturing capacity shall be an allowable and allocable direct cost of the contract.
<br>(IX) Contract terms
<br>
<br>The Secretary, in any contract for procurement under this section—
<br>
<br>(aa) may specify—
<br>
<br>(AA) the dosing and administration requirements for the countermeasure to be developed and procured;
<br>
<br>(BB) the amount of funding that will be dedicated by the Secretary for advanced research, development, and procurement of the countermeasure; and
<br>

<br>
<br>The Secretary shall establish appropriate internal controls for procurements made under this clause, including requirements with respect to documentation of the justification for the use of the authority provided under this paragraph with respect to the procurement involved.
<br>(IV) Authority to limit competition
<br>
<br>In conducting a procurement under this subparagraph, the Secretary may not use the authority provided for under subclause (I) to conduct a procurement on a basis other than full and open competition unless the Secretary determines that the mission of the BioShield Program under the Project BioShield Act of 2004 would be seriously impaired without such a limitation.
<br>(iv) Procedures other than full and open competition
<br>(I) In general
<br>
<br>In using the authority provided in section 3304(a)(1) of title 41 to use procedures other than competitive procedures in the case of a procurement under this subsection, the phrase "available from only one responsible source" in such section 3304(a)(1) shall be deemed to mean "available from only one responsible source or only from a limited number of responsible sources".

<br>The Secretary shall implement this clause in accordance with government-wide regulations implementing such section 3304(a)(1) (including requirements that offers be solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable under the circumstances, that required notices be published, and that submitted offers be considered), as such regulations apply to procurements for which an agency has authority to use procedures other than competitive procedures when the property or services needed by the agency are available from only one responsible source or only from a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the agency.
<br>(v) Premium provision in multiple award contracts
<br>(I) In general
<br>
<br>If, under this subsection, the Secretary enters into contracts with more than one vendor to procure a security countermeasure, such Secretary may, notwithstanding any other provision of law, include in each of such contracts a provision that—
<br>
<br>(aa) identifies an increment of the total quantity of security countermeasure required, whether by percentage or by numbers of units; and
<br>
<br>(bb) promises to pay one or more specified premiums based on the priority of such vendors' production and delivery of the increment identified under item (aa), in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract.
<br>(II) Determination of Government's requirement not reviewable
<br>
<br>If the Secretary includes in each of a set of contracts a provision as described in subclause (I), such Secretary's determination of the total quantity of security countermeasure required, and any amendment of such determination, is committed to agency discretion.
<br>(vi) Extension of closing date for receipt of proposals not reviewable
<br>
<br>A decision by the Secretary to extend the closing date for receipt of proposals for a procurement under this subsection is committed to agency discretion.
<br>(vii) Limiting competition to sources responding to request for information
<br>
<br>In conducting a procurement under this subsection, the Secretary may exclude a source that has not responded to a request for information under section 3306(a)(1)(B) of title 41 if such request has given notice that the Secretary may so exclude such a source.
<br>(viii) Flexibility
<br>
<br>In carrying out this section, the Secretary may, consistent with the applicable provisions of this section, enter into contracts and other agreements that are in the best interest of the Government in meeting identified security countermeasure needs, including with respect to reimbursement of the cost of advanced research and development as a reasonable, allowable, and allocable direct cost of the contract involved.
<br>(8) Interagency cooperation
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>In carrying out activities under this section, the Homeland Security Secretary and the Secretary are authorized, subject to subparagraph (B), to enter into interagency agreements and other collaborative undertakings with other agencies of the United States Government. Such agreements may allow other executive agencies to order qualified and security countermeasures under procurement contracts or other agreements established by the Secretary. Such ordering process (including transfers of appropriated funds between an agency and the Department of Health and Human Services as reimbursements for such orders for countermeasures) may be conducted under the authority of section 1535 of title 31, except that all such orders shall be processed under the terms established under this subsection for the procurement of countermeasures.
<br>(B) Limitation
<br>
<br>An agreement or undertaking under this paragraph shall not authorize another agency to exercise the authorities provided by this section to the Homeland Security Secretary or to the Secretary.

<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13944. Combating Public Health Emergencies and Strengthening National Security by Ensuring Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs Are Made in the United States
<br>
<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13944, Aug. 6, 2020, 85 F.R. 49929, provided:
<br>
<br>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:
<br>
<br>Section 1. Policy. The United States must protect our citizens, critical infrastructure, military forces, and economy against outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases and chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threats. To achieve this, the United States must have a strong Public Health Industrial Base with resilient domestic supply chains for Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs deemed necessary for the United States. These domestic supply chains must be capable of meeting national security requirements for responding to threats arising from CBRN threats and public health emergencies, including emerging infectious diseases such as COVID–19. It is critical that we reduce our dependence on foreign manufacturers for Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs to ensure sufficient and reliable long-term domestic production of these products, to minimize potential shortages, and to mobilize our Nation's Public Health Industrial Base to respond to these threats. It is therefore the policy of the United States to:
<br>
<br>(a) accelerate the development of cost-effective and efficient domestic production of Essential Medicines and Medical Countermeasures and have adequate redundancy built into the domestic supply chain for Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs;
<br>
<br>(b) ensure long-term demand for Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs that are produced in the United States;
<br>
<br>(c) create, maintain, and maximize domestic production capabilities for Critical Inputs, Finished Drug Products, and Finished Devices that are essential to protect public safety and human health and to provide for the national defense; and
<br>
<br>(d) combat the trafficking of counterfeit Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs over e-commerce platforms and from third-party online sellers involved in the government procurement process.
<br>
<br>I am therefore directing each executive department and agency involved in the procurement of Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs (agency) to consider a variety of actions to increase their domestic procurement of Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs, and to identify vulnerabilities in our Nation's supply chains for these products. Under this order, agencies will have the necessary flexibility to increase their domestic procurement in appropriate and responsible ways, while protecting our Nation's service members, veterans, and their families from increases in drug prices and without interfering with our Nation's ability to respond to the spread of COVID–19.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. Maximizing Domestic Production in Procurement. (a) Agencies shall, as appropriate, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, and in consultation with the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (FDA Commissioner) with respect to Critical Inputs, use their respective authorities under section 2304(c) of title 10, United States Code; section 3304(a) of title 41, United States Code; and subpart 6.3 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, title 48, Code of Federal Regulations, to conduct the procurement of Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs by:
<br>
<br>(i) using procedures to limit competition to only those Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs that are produced in the United States; and
<br>
<br>(ii) dividing procurement requirements among two or more manufacturers located in the United States, as appropriate.
<br>
<br>(b) Within 90 days of the date of this order [Aug. 6, 2020], the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in consultation with appropriate agency heads, shall:
<br>
<br>(i) review the authority of each agency to limit the online procurement of Essential Medicines and Medical Countermeasures to e-commerce platforms that have:
<br>
<br>(A) adopted, and certified their compliance with, the applicable best practices published by the Department of Homeland Security in its Report to the President on "Combating Trafficking in Counterfeit and Pirated Goods," dated January 24, 2020; and
<br>
<br>(B) agreed to permit the Department of Homeland Security's National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center to evaluate and confirm their compliance with such best practices; and
<br>
<br>(ii) report its findings to the President.
<br>
<br>(c) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the head of each agency shall, in consultation with the FDA Commissioner, develop and implement procurement strategies, including long-term contracts, consistent with law, to strengthen and mobilize the Public Health Industrial Base in order to increase the manufacture of Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs in the United States.
<br>
<br>(d) No later than 30 days after the FDA Commissioner has identified, pursuant to section 3(c) of this order, the initial list of Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs, the United States Trade Representative shall, to the extent permitted by law, take all appropriate action to modify United States Federal procurement product coverage under all relevant Free Trade Agreements and the World Trade Organization Agreement on Government Procurement to exclude coverage of Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs. The United States Trade Representative shall further modify United States Federal procurement product coverage, as appropriate, to reflect updates by the FDA Commissioner. After the modifications to United States Federal procurement coverage take effect, the United States Trade Representative shall make any necessary, corresponding modifications of existing waivers under section 301 of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 [19 U.S.C. 2511]. The United States Trade Representative shall notify the President, through the Director of OMB, once it has taken the actions described in this subsection.
<br>
<br>(e) No later than 60 days after the FDA Commissioner has identified, pursuant to section 3(c) of this order, the initial list of Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs, and notwithstanding the public interest exception in subsection (f)(i)(1) of this section, the Secretary of Defense shall, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, use his authority under section 225.872–-1(c) of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement to restrict the procurement of Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs to domestic sources and to reject otherwise acceptable offers of such products from sources in Qualifying Countries in instances where considered necessary for national defense reasons.
<br>
<br>(f) Subsections (a), (d), and (e) of this section shall not apply:
<br>
<br>(i) where the head of the agency determines in writing, with respect to a specific contract or order, that (1) their application would be inconsistent with the public interest; (2) the relevant Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs are not produced in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities and of a satisfactory quality; or (3) their application would cause the cost of the procurement to increase by more than 25 percent, unless applicable law requires a higher percentage, in which case such higher percentage shall apply;
<br>
<br>(ii) with respect to the procurement of items that are necessary to respond to any public health emergency declared under section 319 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 247d), any major disaster or emergency declared under the Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.), or any national emergency declared under the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.).
<br>
<br>(g) To the maximum extent permitted by law, any public interest determination made pursuant to section 2(f)(i)(1) of this order shall be construed to maximize the procurement and use of Essential Medicines and Medical Countermeasures produced in the United States.
<br>
<br>(h) The head of an agency who makes any determination pursuant to section 2(f)(i) of this order shall submit an annual report to the President, through the Director of OMB and the Assistant to the President for Trade and Manufacturing Policy, describing the justification for each such determination.
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. Identifying Vulnerabilities in Supply Chains. (a) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, through the FDA Commissioner and in consultation with the Director of OMB, shall take all necessary and appropriate action, consistent with law, to identify vulnerabilities in the supply chain for Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs and to mitigate those vulnerabilities, including by:

<br>§247d–6d. Targeted liability protections for pandemic and epidemic products and security countermeasures
<br>(a) Liability protections
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Subject to the other provisions of this section, a covered person shall be immune from suit and liability under Federal and State law with respect to all claims for loss caused by, arising out of, relating to, or resulting from the administration to or the use by an individual of a covered countermeasure if a declaration under subsection (b) has been issued with respect to such countermeasure.
<br>(2) Scope of claims for loss
<br>(A) Loss
<br>
<br>For purposes of this section, the term "loss" means any type of loss, including—
<br>
<br>(i) death;
<br>
<br>(ii) physical, mental, or emotional injury, illness, disability, or condition;
<br>
<br>(iii) fear of physical, mental, or emotional injury, illness, disability, or condition, including any need for medical monitoring; and
<br>
<br>(iv) loss of or damage to property, including business interruption loss.
<br>
<br>Each of clauses (i) through (iv) applies without regard to the date of the occurrence, presentation, or discovery of the loss described in the clause.
<br>(B) Scope
<br>
<br>The immunity under paragraph (1) applies to any claim for loss that has a causal relationship with the administration to or use by an individual of a covered countermeasure, including a causal relationship with the design, development, clinical testing or investigation, manufacture, labeling, distribution, formulation, packaging, marketing, promotion, sale, purchase, donation, dispensing, prescribing, administration, licensing, or use of such countermeasure.
<br>(3) Certain conditions
<br>
<br>Subject to the other provisions of this section, immunity under paragraph (1) with respect to a covered countermeasure applies only if—
<br>
<br>(A) the countermeasure was administered or used during the effective period of the declaration that was issued under subsection (b) with respect to the countermeasure;
<br>
<br>(B) the countermeasure was administered or used for the category or categories of diseases, health conditions, or threats to health specified in the declaration; and
<br>
<br>(C) in addition, in the case of a covered person who is a program planner or qualified person with respect to the administration or use of the countermeasure, the countermeasure was administered to or used by an individual who—
<br>
<br>(i) was in a population specified by the declaration; and
<br>
<br>(ii) was at the time of administration physically present in a geographic area specified by the declaration or had a connection to such area specified in the declaration.
<br>(4) Applicability of certain conditions
<br>
<br>With respect to immunity under paragraph (1) and subject to the other provisions of this section:
<br>
<br>(A) In the case of a covered person who is a manufacturer or distributor of the covered countermeasure involved, the immunity applies without regard to whether such countermeasure was administered to or used by an individual in accordance with the conditions described in paragraph (3)(C).
<br>
<br>(B) In the case of a covered person who is a program planner or qualified person with respect to the administration or use of the covered countermeasure, the scope of immunity includes circumstances in which the countermeasure was administered to or used by an individual in circumstances in which the covered person reasonably could have believed that the countermeasure was administered or used in accordance with the conditions described in paragraph (3)(C).
<br>(5) Effect of distribution method
<br>
<br>The provisions of this section apply to a covered countermeasure regardless of whether such countermeasure is obtained by donation, commercial sale, or any other means of distribution, except to the extent that, under paragraph (2)(E) of subsection (b), the declaration under such subsection provides that subsection (a) applies only to covered countermeasures obtained through a particular means of distribution.
<br>(6) Rebuttable presumption
<br>
<br>For purposes of paragraph (1), there shall be a rebuttable presumption that any administration or use, during the effective period of the emergency declaration by the Secretary under subsection (b), of a covered countermeasure shall have been for the category or categories of diseases, health conditions, or threats to health with respect to which such declaration was issued.
<br>(b) Declaration by Secretary
<br>(1) Authority to issue declaration
<br>
<br>Subject to paragraph (2), if the Secretary makes a determination that a disease or other health condition or other threat to health constitutes a public health emergency, or that there is a credible risk that the disease, condition, or threat may in the future constitute such an emergency, the Secretary may make a declaration, through publication in the Federal Register, recommending, under conditions as the Secretary may specify, the manufacture, testing, development, distribution, administration, or use of one or more covered countermeasures, and stating that subsection (a) is in effect with respect to the activities so recommended.
<br>(2) Contents
<br>
<br>In issuing a declaration under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall identify, for each covered countermeasure specified in the declaration—
<br>
<br>(A) the category or categories of diseases, health conditions, or threats to health for which the Secretary recommends the administration or use of the countermeasure;
<br>
<br>(B) the period or periods during which, including as modified by paragraph (3), subsection (a) is in effect, which period or periods may be designated by dates, or by milestones or other description of events, including factors specified in paragraph (6);
<br>
<br>(C) the population or populations of individuals for which subsection (a) is in effect with respect to the administration or use of the countermeasure (which may be a specification that such subsection applies without geographic limitation to all individuals);
<br>
<br>(D) the geographic area or areas for which subsection (a) is in effect with respect to the administration or use of the countermeasure (which may be a specification that such subsection applies without geographic limitation), including, with respect to individuals in the populations identified under subparagraph (C), a specification, as determined appropriate by the Secretary, of whether the declaration applies only to individuals physically present in such areas or whether in addition the declaration applies to individuals who have a connection to such areas, which connection is described in the declaration; and
<br>
<br>(E) whether subsection (a) is effective only to a particular means of distribution as provided in subsection (a)(5) for obtaining the countermeasure, and if so, the particular means to which such subsection is effective.
<br>(3) Effective period of declaration
<br>(A) Flexibility of period
<br>
<br>The Secretary may, in describing periods under paragraph (2)(B), have different periods for different covered persons to address different logistical, practical or other differences in responsibilities.
<br>(B) Additional time to be specified
<br>
<br>In each declaration under paragraph (1), the Secretary, after consulting, to the extent the Secretary deems appropriate, with the manufacturer of the covered countermeasure, shall also specify a date that is after the ending date specified under paragraph (2)(B) and that allows what the Secretary determines is—
<br>
<br>(i) a reasonable period for the manufacturer to arrange for disposition of the covered countermeasure, including the return of such product to the manufacturer; and
<br>
<br>(ii) a reasonable period for covered persons to take such other actions as may be appropriate to limit administration or use of the covered countermeasure.
<br>(C) Additional period for certain strategic national stockpile countermeasures
<br>
<br>With respect to a covered countermeasure that is in the stockpile under section 247d–6b of this title, if such countermeasure was the subject of a declaration under paragraph (1) at the time that it was obtained for the stockpile, the effective period of such declaration shall include a period when the countermeasure is administered or used pursuant to a distribution or release from the stockpile.
<br>(4) Amendments to declaration
<br>
<br>The Secretary may through publication in the Federal Register amend any portion of a declaration under paragraph (1). Such an amendment shall not retroactively limit the applicability of subsection (a) with respect to the administration or use of the covered countermeasure involved.
<br>(5) Certain disclosures
<br>
<br>In publishing a declaration under paragraph (1) in the Federal Register, the Secretary is not required to disclose any matter described in section 552(b) of title 5.
<br>(6) Factors to be considered
<br>
<br>In deciding whether and under what circumstances or conditions to issue a declaration under paragraph (1) with respect to a covered countermeasure, the Secretary shall consider the desirability of encouraging the design, development, clinical testing or investigation, manufacture, labeling, distribution, formulation, packaging, marketing, promotion, sale, purchase, donation, dispensing, prescribing, administration, licensing, and use of such countermeasure.
<br>(7) Judicial review
<br>
<br>No court of the United States, or of any State, shall have subject matter jurisdiction to review, whether by mandamus or otherwise, any action by the Secretary under this subsection.
<br>(8) Preemption of State law
<br>
<br>During the effective period of a declaration under subsection (b), or at any time with respect to conduct undertaken in accordance with such declaration, no State or political subdivision of a State may establish, enforce, or continue in effect with respect to a covered countermeasure any provision of law or legal requirement that—
<br>
<br>(A) is different from, or is in conflict with, any requirement applicable under this section; and
<br>
<br>(B) relates to the design, development, clinical testing or investigation, formulation, manufacture, distribution, sale, donation, purchase, marketing, promotion, packaging, labeling, licensing, use, any other aspect of safety or efficacy, or the prescribing, dispensing, or administration by qualified persons of the covered countermeasure, or to any matter included in a requirement applicable to the covered countermeasure under this section or any other provision of this chapter, or under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.].
<br>(9) Report to Congress
<br>
<br>Within 30 days after making a declaration under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall submit to the appropriate committees of the Congress a report that provides an explanation of the reasons for issuing the declaration and the reasons underlying the determinations of the Secretary with respect to paragraph (2). Within 30 days after making an amendment under paragraph (4), the Secretary shall submit to such committees a report that provides the reasons underlying the determination of the Secretary to make the amendment.
<br>(c) Definition of willful misconduct
<br>(1) Definition
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Except as the meaning of such term is further restricted pursuant to paragraph (2), the term "willful misconduct" shall, for purposes of subsection (d), denote an act or omission that is taken—
<br>
<br>(i) intentionally to achieve a wrongful purpose;
<br>
<br>(ii) knowingly without legal or factual justification; and
<br>
<br>(iii) in disregard of a known or obvious risk that is so great as to make it highly probable that the harm will outweigh the benefit.
<br>(B) Rule of construction
<br>
<br>The criterion stated in subparagraph (A) shall be construed as establishing a standard for liability that is more stringent than a standard of negligence in any form or recklessness.
<br>(2) Authority to promulgate regulatory definition
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall promulgate regulations, which may be promulgated through interim final rules, that further restrict the scope of actions or omissions by a covered person that may qualify as "willful misconduct" for purposes of subsection (d).
<br>(B) Factors to be considered
<br>
<br>In promulgating the regulations under this paragraph, the Secretary, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall consider the need to define the scope of permissible civil actions under subsection (d) in a way that will not adversely affect the public health.
<br>(C) Temporal scope of regulations
<br>
<br>The regulations under this paragraph may specify the temporal effect that they shall be given for purposes of subsection (d).
<br>(D) Initial rulemaking
<br>
<br>Within 180 days after December 30, 2005, the Secretary, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall commence and complete an initial rulemaking process under this paragraph.
<br>(3) Proof of willful misconduct
<br>
<br>In an action under subsection (d), the plaintiff shall have the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence willful misconduct by each covered person sued and that such willful misconduct caused death or serious physical injury.
<br>(4) Defense for acts or omissions taken pursuant to Secretary's declaration
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a program planner or qualified person shall not have engaged in "willful misconduct" as a matter of law where such program planner or qualified person acted consistent with applicable directions, guidelines, or recommendations by the Secretary regarding the administration or use of a covered countermeasure that is specified in the declaration under subsection (b), provided either the Secretary, or a State or local health authority, was provided with notice of information regarding serious physical injury or death from the administration or use of a covered countermeasure that is material to the plaintiff's alleged loss within 7 days of the actual discovery of such information by such program planner or qualified person.
<br>(5) Exclusion for regulated activity of manufacturer or distributor
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>If an act or omission by a manufacturer or distributor with respect to a covered countermeasure, which act or omission is alleged under subsection (e)(3)(A) to constitute willful misconduct, is subject to regulation by this chapter or by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.], such act or omission shall not constitute "willful misconduct" for purposes of subsection (d) if—
<br>
<br>(i) neither the Secretary nor the Attorney General has initiated an enforcement action with respect to such act or omission; or
<br>
<br>(ii) such an enforcement action has been initiated and the action has been terminated or finally resolved without a covered remedy.
<br>
<br>Any action or proceeding under subsection (d) shall be stayed during the pendency of such an enforcement action.
<br>(B) Definitions
<br>
<br>For purposes of this paragraph, the following terms have the following meanings:
<br>(i) Enforcement action
<br>
<br>The term "enforcement action" means a criminal prosecution, an action seeking an injunction, a seizure action, a civil monetary proceeding based on willful misconduct, a mandatory recall of a product because voluntary recall was refused, a proceeding to compel repair or replacement of a product, a termination of an exemption under section 505(i) or 520(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 355(i), 360j(g)], a debarment proceeding, an investigator disqualification proceeding where an investigator is an employee or agent of the manufacturer, a revocation, based on willful misconduct, of an authorization under section 564 of such Act [21 U.S.C. 360bbb–3], or a suspension or withdrawal, based on willful misconduct, of an approval or clearance under chapter V of such Act [21 U.S.C. 351 et seq.] or of a licensure under section 262 of this title.
<br>(ii) Covered remedy
<br>
<br>The term "covered remedy" means an outcome—
<br>
<br>(I) that is a criminal conviction, an injunction, or a condemnation, a civil monetary payment, a product recall, a repair or replacement of a product, a termination of an exemption under section 505(i) or 520(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 355(i), 360j(g)], a debarment, an investigator disqualification, a revocation of an authorization under section 564 of such Act [21 U.S.C. 360bbb–3], or a suspension or withdrawal of an approval or clearance under chapter 5 1 of such Act or of a licensure under section 262 of this title; and
<br>
<br>(II) that results from a final determination by a court or from a final agency action.
<br>(iii) Final
<br>
<br>The terms "final" and "finally"—
<br>
<br>(I) with respect to a court determination, or to a final resolution of an enforcement action that is a court determination, mean a judgment from which an appeal of right cannot be taken or a voluntary or stipulated dismissal; and
<br>
<br>(II) with respect to an agency action, or to a final resolution of an enforcement action that is an agency action, mean an order that is not subject to further review within the agency and that has not been reversed, vacated, enjoined, or otherwise nullified by a final court determination or a voluntary or stipulated dismissal.
<br>(C) Rules of construction
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed—
<br>
<br>(I) to affect the interpretation of any provision of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.], of this chapter, or of any other applicable statute or regulation; or
<br>
<br>(II) to impair, delay, alter, or affect the authority, including the enforcement discretion, of the United States, of the Secretary, of the Attorney General, or of any other official with respect to any administrative or court proceeding under this chapter, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.], under title 18, or under any other applicable statute or regulation.
<br>(ii) Mandatory recalls
<br>
<br>A mandatory recall called for in the declaration is not a Food and Drug Administration enforcement action.
<br>(d) Exception to immunity of covered persons
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Subject to subsection (f), the sole exception to the immunity from suit and liability of covered persons set forth in subsection (a) shall be for an exclusive Federal cause of action against a covered person for death or serious physical injury proximately caused by willful misconduct, as defined pursuant to subsection (c), by such covered person. For purposes of section 2679(b)(2)(B) of title 28, such a cause of action is not an action brought for violation of a statute of the United States under which an action against an individual is otherwise authorized.
<br>(2) Persons who can sue
<br>
<br>An action under this subsection may be brought for wrongful death or serious physical injury by any person who suffers such injury or by any representative of such a person.
<br>(e) Procedures for suit
<br>(1) Exclusive Federal jurisdiction
