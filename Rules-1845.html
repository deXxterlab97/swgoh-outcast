<br>
<br>"(1) The Philippine islands became a United States possession in 1898 when they were ceded from Spain following the Spanish-American War.
<br>
<br>"(2) During World War II, Filipinos served in a variety of units, some of which came under the direct control of the United States Armed Forces.
<br>
<br>"(3) The regular Philippine Scouts, the new Philippine Scouts, the Guerrilla Services, and more than 100,000 members of the Philippine Commonwealth Army were called into the service of the United States Armed Forces of the Far East on July 26, 1941, by an executive order of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
<br>
<br>"(4) Even after hostilities had ceased, wartime service of the new Philippine Scouts continued as a matter of law until the end of 1946, and the force gradually disbanded and was disestablished in 1950.

<br>"(5) Filipino veterans who were granted benefits prior to the enactment of the so-called Rescissions Acts of 1946 (Public Laws 79–301 [60 Stat. 6] and 79–391 [60 Stat. 221]) currently receive full benefits under laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, but under section 107 of title 38, United States Code, the service of certain other Filipino veterans is deemed not to be active service for purposes of such laws.
<br>
<br>"(6) These other Filipino veterans only receive certain benefits under title 38, United States Code, and, depending on where they legally reside, are paid such benefit amounts at reduced rates.
<br>
<br>"(7) The benefits such veterans receive include service-connected compensation benefits paid under chapter 11 of title 38, United States Code, dependency indemnity compensation survivor benefits paid under chapter 13 of title 38, United States Code, and burial benefits under chapters 23 and 24 of title 38, United States Code, and such benefits are paid to beneficiaries at the rate of $0.50 per dollar authorized, unless they lawfully reside in the United States.
<br>
<br>"(8) Dependents' educational assistance under chapter 35 of title 38, United States Code, is also payable for the dependents of such veterans at the rate of $0.50 per dollar authorized, regardless of the veterans' residency.

<br>
<br>(E) Subject to paragraph (3) of this subsection, a veteran or other person whose travel to or from a Department facility is medically required to be performed by a special mode of travel and who is determined under such regulations to be unable to defray the expenses of the travel for which payment under this section is claimed.
<br>
<br>(F) A veteran whose travel to a Department facility is incident to a scheduled compensation and pension examination.
<br>
<br>(G) A veteran with vision impairment, a veteran with a spinal cord injury or disorder, or a veteran with double or multiple amputations whose travel is in connection with care provided through a special disabilities rehabilitation program of the Department (including programs provided by spinal cord injury centers, blind rehabilitation centers, and prosthetics rehabilitation centers) if such care is provided—
<br>
<br>(i) on an in-patient basis; or
<br>
<br>(ii) during a period in which the Secretary provides the veteran with temporary lodging at a facility of the Department to make such care more accessible to the veteran.
<br>
<br>(2) The Secretary may make payments provided for in this section to or for any person not covered by paragraph (1) of this subsection for travel by such person for examination, treatment, or care. Such payments shall be made in accordance with regulations which the Secretary shall prescribe.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the Secretary shall not make payments under this section for travel performed by a special mode of travel unless (i) the travel by such mode is medically required and is authorized by the Secretary before the travel begins, or (ii) the travel by such mode is in connection with a medical emergency of such a nature that the delay incident to obtaining authorization from the Secretary to use that mode of travel would have been hazardous to the person's life or health.
<br>
<br>(B) In the case of travel by a person to or from a Department facility by special mode of travel, the Secretary may provide payment under this section to the provider of the transportation by special mode before determining the eligibility of such person for such payment if the Secretary determines that providing such payment is in the best interest of furnishing care and services. Such a payment shall be made subject to subsequently recovering from such person the amount of the payment if such person is determined to have been ineligible for payment for such travel.
<br>
<br>(C) In the case of transportation of a person to or from a Department facility by ambulance, the Secretary may pay the provider of the transportation the lesser of the actual charge for the transportation or the amount determined by the fee schedule established under section 1834(l) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395m(l)) unless the Secretary has entered into a contract for that transportation with the provider.
<br>
<br>(4) In determining for purposes of subsection (a) whether travel by air is the only practical way for a veteran to reach a Department facility, the Secretary shall consider the medical condition of the veteran and any other impediments to the use of ground transportation by the veteran.

<br>(2) In the case of a person who is determined by the Secretary to be a person who is required to make six or more one-way trips for needed examination, treatment, or care during the remainder of the calendar month in which the determination is made or during any subsequent calendar month during the one-year period following the last day of the month in which the determination is made, the amount deducted by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection from payments for trips made to or from such facility during any such month shall not exceed $18.
<br>
<br>(3) No deduction shall be made pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection in the case of a person whose travel to or from a Department facility is performed by a special mode of travel for which payment under this section is authorized under subsection (b)(3) of this section.
<br>
<br>(4) The Secretary may waive the deduction requirement of paragraph (1) of this subsection in the case of the travel of any veteran for whom the imposition of the deduction would cause severe financial hardship. The Secretary shall prescribe in regulations the conditions under which a finding of severe financial hardship is warranted for purposes of this paragraph.
<br>
<br>(d) Payment of the following expenses or allowances in connection with vocational rehabilitation, counseling, or upon termination of examination, treatment, or care, may be made before the completion of travel:
<br>
<br>(1) The mileage allowance authorized by subsection (a) of this section.
<br>
<br>(2) Actual local travel expenses.
<br>
<br>(3) The expense of hiring an automobile or ambulance, or the fee authorized for the services of a nonemployee attendant.
<br>
<br>(e)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), when any person entitled to mileage under this section requires an attendant (other than an employee of the Department) in order to perform such travel, the attendant may be allowed expenses of travel upon the same basis as such person.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) Without regard to whether an eligible veteran entitled to mileage under this section for travel to a Department facility for the purpose of medical examination, treatment, or care requires an attendant in order to perform such travel, an attendant of such veteran described in subparagraph (B) may be allowed expenses of travel (including lodging and subsistence) upon the same basis as such veteran during—
<br>
<br>(i) the period of time in which such veteran is traveling to and from a Department facility for the purpose of medical examination, treatment, or care; and
<br>
<br>(ii) the duration of the medical examination, treatment, or care episode for such veteran.
<br>
<br>(B) An attendant of a veteran described in this subparagraph is a provider of personal care services for such veteran who is approved under paragraph (6) of section 1720G(a) of this title or designated under paragraph (7) of such section 1720G(a).
<br>
<br>(C) The Secretary may prescribe regulations to carry out this paragraph. Such regulations may include provisions—
<br>
<br>(i) to limit the number of attendants that may receive expenses of travel under this paragraph for a single medical examination, treatment, or care episode of an eligible veteran; and
<br>
<br>(ii) to require such attendants to use certain travel services.
<br>
<br>(D) In this subsection, the term "eligible veteran" has the meaning given that term in section 1720G(a)(2) of this title.
<br>
<br>(f) The Secretary may provide for the purchase of printed reduced-fare requests for use by veterans and their authorized attendants when traveling at their own expense to or from any Department facility.
<br>
<br>(g)(1) Beginning one year after the date of the enactment of the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010, the Secretary may adjust the mileage rate described in subsection (a) to be equal to the mileage reimbursement rate for the use of privately owned vehicles by Government employees on official business (when a Government vehicle is available), as prescribed by the Administrator of General Services under section 5707(b) of title 5.
<br>
<br>(2) If an adjustment in the mileage rate under paragraph (1) results in a lower mileage rate than the mileage rate otherwise specified in subsection (a), the Secretary shall, not later than 60 days before the date of the implementation of the mileage rate as so adjusted, submit to Congress a written report setting forth the adjustment in the mileage rate under this subsection, together with a justification for the decision to make the adjustment in the mileage rate under this subsection.

<br>
<br>1 See References in Text note below.
<br>§114. Multiyear procurement
<br>
<br>(a) The Secretary may enter into a multiyear contract for the procurement of supplies or services if the Secretary makes each of the following determinations:
<br>
<br>(1) Appropriations are available for obligations that are necessary for total payments that would be required during the fiscal year in which the contract is entered into, plus the estimated amount of any cancellation charge payable under the contract.
<br>
<br>(2) The contract is in the best interest of the United States by reason of the effect that use of a multiyear, rather than one-year, contract would have in—
<br>
<br>(A) reducing costs;
<br>
<br>(B) achieving economies in contract administration or in any other Department activities;
<br>
<br>(C) increasing quality of performance by or service from the contractors; or
<br>
<br>(D) encouraging effective competition.
<br>
<br>(3) During the proposed contract period—
<br>
<br>(A) there will be a continuing or recurring need for the supplies or services being procured;
<br>
<br>(B) there is not a substantial likelihood of substantial changes in the need for such supplies or services in terms of the total quantity of such supplies or services or of the rate of delivery of such supplies or services; and
<br>
<br>(C) the specifications for the supplies or services are expected to be reasonably stable.
<br>
<br>(4) The risks relating to the prospective contractor's ability to perform in accordance with the specifications and other terms of the contract are not excessive.
<br>
<br>(5) The use of a multiyear contract will not inhibit small business concerns in competing for the contract.
<br>
<br>(6) In the case of the procurement of a pharmaceutical item for which a patent has expired less than four years before the date on which the solicitation of offers is issued, there is no substantial likelihood that increased competition among potential contractors would occur during the term of the contract as the result of the availability of generic equivalents increasing during the term of the contract.
<br>
<br>(b)(1) A multiyear contract authorized by this section shall contain—
<br>
<br>(A) a provision that the obligation of the United States under the contract during any fiscal year which is included in the contract period and is subsequent to the fiscal year during which the contract is entered into is contingent on the availability of sufficient appropriations (as determined by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (2)(A) of this subsection) if, at the time the contract is entered into, appropriations are not available to cover the total estimated payments that will be required during the full term of the contract; and
<br>
<br>(B) notwithstanding section 1502(a) of title 31, a provision for the payment of reasonable cancellation charges to compensate the contractor for nonrecurring, unrecovered costs, if any, if the performance is cancelled pursuant to the provision required by subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) If, during a fiscal year after the fiscal year during which a multiyear contract is entered into under this section, the Secretary determines that, in light of other funding needs involved in the operation of Department programs, the amount of funds appropriated for such subsequent fiscal year is not sufficient for such contract, the Secretary shall cancel such contract pursuant to the provisions required by paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection.
<br>
<br>(B) Cancellation charges under a multiyear contract shall be paid from the appropriated funds which were originally available for performance of the contract or the payment of cancellation costs unless such funds are not available in an amount sufficient to pay the entire amount of the cancellation charges payable under the contract. In a case in which such funds are not available in such amount, funds available for the procurement of supplies and services for use for the same purposes as the supplies or services procured through such contract shall be used to the extent necessary to pay such cost.
<br>
<br>(c) Nothing in this section shall be construed so as to restrict the Secretary's exercise of the right to terminate for convenience a contract under any other provision of law which authorizes multiyear contracting.
<br>
<br>(d) The Secretary shall prescribe regulations for the implementation of this section.
<br>
<br>(e) For the purposes of this section:
<br>
<br>(1) The term "appropriations" has the meaning given that term in section 1511 of title 31.
<br>
<br>(2) The term "multiyear contract" means a contract which by its terms is to remain in effect for a period which extends beyond the end of the fiscal year during which the contract is entered into but not beyond the end of the fourth fiscal year following such fiscal year. Such term does not include a contract for construction or for a lease of real property.
<br>
<br>(3) The term "nonrecurring, unrecovered costs" means those costs reasonably incurred by the contractor in performing a multiyear contract which (as determined under regulations prescribed under subsection (d) of this section) are generally incurred on a one-time basis.
