<br>§1604. Liability of biomaterials suppliers
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in section 1606 of this title, a biomaterials supplier shall not be liable for harm to a claimant caused by an implant unless such supplier is liable—
<br>
<br>(1) as a manufacturer of the implant, as provided in subsection (b);
<br>
<br>(2) as a seller of the implant, as provided in subsection (c); or
<br>
<br>(3) for furnishing raw materials or component parts for the implant that failed to meet applicable contractual requirements or specifications, as provided in subsection (d).
<br>(b) Liability as manufacturer
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>A biomaterials supplier may, to the extent required and permitted by any other applicable law, be liable for harm to a claimant caused by an implant if the biomaterials supplier is the manufacturer of the implant.
<br>(2) Grounds for liability
<br>
<br>The biomaterials supplier may be considered the manufacturer of the implant that allegedly caused harm to a claimant only if the biomaterials supplier—
<br>
<br>(A)(i) registered or was required to register with the Secretary pursuant to section 360 of this title and the regulations issued under such section; and
<br>
<br>(ii) included or was required to include the implant on a list of devices filed with the Secretary pursuant to section 360(j) of this title and the regulations issued under such section;
<br>
<br>(B) is the subject of a declaration issued by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (3) that states that the supplier, with respect to the implant that allegedly caused harm to the claimant, was required to—
<br>
<br>(i) register with the Secretary under section 360 of this title, and the regulations issued under such section, but failed to do so; or
<br>
<br>(ii) include the implant on a list of devices filed with the Secretary pursuant to section 360(j) of this title and the regulations issued under such section, but failed to do so; or
<br>
<br>(C) is related by common ownership or control to a person meeting all the requirements described in subparagraph (A) or (B), if the court deciding a motion to dismiss in accordance with section 1605(c)(3)(B)(i) of this title finds, on the basis of affidavits submitted in accordance with section 1605 of this title, that it is necessary to impose liability on the biomaterials supplier as a manufacturer because the related manufacturer meeting the requirements of subparagraph (A) or (B) lacks sufficient financial resources to satisfy any judgment that the court feels it is likely to enter should the claimant prevail.
<br>(3) Administrative procedures
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary may issue a declaration described in paragraph (2)(B) on the motion of the Secretary or on petition by any person, after providing—
<br>
<br>(i) notice to the affected persons; and
<br>
<br>(ii) an opportunity for an informal hearing.
<br>(B) Docketing and final decision
<br>
<br>Immediately upon receipt of a petition filed pursuant to this paragraph, the Secretary shall docket the petition. Not later than 120 days after the petition is filed, the Secretary shall issue a final decision on the petition.
<br>(C) Applicability of statute of limitations
<br>
<br>Any applicable statute of limitations shall toll during the period from the time a claimant files a petition with the Secretary under this paragraph until such time as either (i) the Secretary issues a final decision on the petition, or (ii) the petition is withdrawn.
<br>(D) Stay pending petition for declaration
<br>
<br>If a claimant has filed a petition for a declaration with respect to a defendant, and the Secretary has not issued a final decision on the petition, the court shall stay all proceedings with respect to that defendant until such time as the Secretary has issued a final decision on the petition.
<br>(c) Liability as seller
<br>
<br>A biomaterials supplier may, to the extent required and permitted by any other applicable law, be liable as a seller for harm to a claimant caused by an implant only if—
<br>
<br>(1) the biomaterials supplier—
<br>
<br>(A) held title to the implant and then acted as a seller of the implant after its initial sale by the manufacturer; or
<br>
<br>(B) acted under contract as a seller to arrange for the transfer of the implant directly to the claimant after the initial sale by the manufacturer of the implant; or
<br>
<br>(2) the biomaterials supplier is related by common ownership or control to a person meeting all the requirements described in paragraph (1), if a court deciding a motion to dismiss in accordance with section 1605(c)(3)(B)(ii) of this title finds, on the basis of affidavits submitted in accordance with section 1605 of this title, that it is necessary to impose liability on the biomaterials supplier as a seller because the related seller meeting the requirements of paragraph (1) lacks sufficient financial resources to satisfy any judgment that the court feels it is likely to enter should the claimant prevail.
<br>(d) Liability for failure to meet applicable contractual requirements or specifications
<br>
<br>A biomaterials supplier may, to the extent required and permitted by any other applicable law, be liable for harm to a claimant caused by an implant if the claimant in an action shows, by a preponderance of the evidence, that—
<br>
<br>(1) the biomaterials supplier supplied raw materials or component parts for use in the implant that either—
<br>
<br>(A) did not constitute the product described in the contract between the biomaterials supplier and the person who contracted for the supplying of the product; or
<br>
<br>(B) failed to meet any specifications that were—
<br>
<br>(i) accepted, pursuant to applicable law, by the biomaterials supplier;
<br>
<br>(ii) published by the biomaterials supplier;
<br>
<br>(iii) provided by the biomaterials supplier to the person who contracted for such product;
<br>
<br>(iv) contained in a master file that was submitted by the biomaterials supplier to the Secretary and that is currently maintained by the biomaterials supplier for purposes of premarket approval of medical devices; or
<br>
<br>(v) included in the submissions for purposes of premarket approval or review by the Secretary under section 360, 360c, 360e, or 360j of this title, and received clearance from the Secretary if such specifications were accepted, pursuant to applicable law, by the biomaterials supplier; and
<br>
<br>(2) such failure to meet applicable contractual requirements or specifications was an actual and proximate cause of the harm to the claimant.

<br>§1605. Procedures for dismissal of civil actions against biomaterials suppliers
<br>(a) Motion to dismiss
<br>
<br>A defendant may, at any time during which a motion to dismiss may be filed under applicable law, move to dismiss an action against it on the grounds that the defendant is a biomaterials supplier and one or more of the following:
<br>
<br>(1) The defendant is not liable as a manufacturer, as provided in section 1604(b) of this title.
<br>
<br>(2) The defendant is not liable as a seller, as provided in section 1604(c) of this title.
<br>
<br>(3) The defendant is not liable for furnishing raw materials or component parts for the implant that failed to meet applicable contractual requirements or specifications, as provided in section 1604(d) of this title.
<br>
<br>(4) The claimant did not name the manufacturer as a party to the action, as provided in subsection (b).
<br>(b) Manufacturer of implant shall be named a party
<br>
<br>In any civil action covered by this chapter, the claimant shall be required to name the manufacturer of the implant as a party to the action, unless—
<br>
<br>(1) the manufacturer is subject to service of process solely in a jurisdiction in which the biomaterials supplier is not domiciled or subject to a service of process; or
<br>
<br>(2) a claim against the manufacturer is barred by applicable law or rule of practice.
<br>(c) Proceeding on motion to dismiss
<br>
<br>The following rules shall apply to any proceeding on a motion to dismiss filed by a defendant under this section:
<br>(1) Effect of motion to dismiss on discovery
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subparagraph (B), if a defendant files a motion to dismiss under subsection (a), no discovery shall be permitted in connection with the action that is the subject of the motion, other than discovery necessary to determine a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, until such time as the court rules on the motion to dismiss.
<br>(B) Discovery
<br>
<br>If a defendant files a motion to dismiss under subsection (a)(3) on the grounds that it did not furnish raw materials or component parts for the implant that failed to meet applicable contractual requirements or specifications, the court may permit discovery limited to issues that are directly relevant to—
<br>
<br>(i) the pending motion to dismiss; or
<br>
<br>(ii) the jurisdiction of the court.
<br>(2) Affidavits
<br>(A) Defendant
<br>
<br>A defendant may submit affidavits supporting the grounds for dismissal contained in its motion to dismiss under subsection (a). If the motion is made under subsection (a)(1), the defendant may submit an affidavit demonstrating that the defendant has not included the implant on a list, if any, filed with the Secretary pursuant to section 360(j) of this title.
<br>(B) Claimant
<br>
<br>In response to a motion to dismiss, the claimant may submit affidavits demonstrating that—
<br>
<br>(i) the Secretary has, with respect to the defendant and the implant that allegedly caused harm to the claimant, issued a declaration pursuant to section 1604(b)(2)(B) of this title; or
<br>
<br>(ii) the defendant is a seller of the implant who is liable under section 1604(c) of this title.
<br>(3) Basis of ruling on motion to dismiss
<br>
<br>The court shall rule on a motion to dismiss filed under subsection (a) solely on the basis of the pleadings and affidavits of the parties made pursuant to this subsection. The court shall grant a motion to dismiss filed under subsection (a)—
<br>
<br>(A) unless the claimant submits a valid affidavit that demonstrates that the defendant is not a biomaterials supplier;
<br>
<br>(B) unless the court determines, to the extent raised in the pleadings and affidavits, that one or more of the following apply:
<br>
<br>(i) the defendant may be liable as a manufacturer, as provided in section 1604(b) of this title;
<br>
<br>(ii) the defendant may be liable as a seller, as provided in section 1604(c) of this title; or
<br>
<br>(iii) the defendant may be liable for furnishing raw materials or component parts for the implant that failed to meet applicable contractual requirements or specifications, as provided in section 1604(d) of this title; or
<br>
<br>(C) if the claimant did not name the manufacturer as a party to the action, as provided in subsection (b).
<br>(4) Treatment of motion as motion for summary judgment
<br>
<br>The court may treat a motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment subject to subsection (d) in order to determine whether the pleadings and affidavits, in connection with such action, raise genuine issues of material fact concerning whether the defendant furnished raw materials or component parts of the implant that failed to meet applicable contractual requirements or specifications as provided in section 1604(d) of this title.
<br>(d) Summary judgment
<br>(1) In general
<br>(A) Basis for entry of judgment
<br>
<br>If a motion to dismiss of a biomaterials supplier is to be treated as a motion for summary judgment under subsection (c)(4) or if a biomaterials supplier moves for summary judgment, the biomaterials supplier shall be entitled to entry of judgment without trial if the court finds there is no genuine issue of material fact for each applicable element set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 1604(d) of this title.
<br>(B) Issues of material fact
<br>
<br>With respect to a finding made under subparagraph (A), the court shall consider a genuine issue of material fact to exist only if the evidence submitted by the claimant would be sufficient to allow a reasonable jury to reach a verdict for the claimant if the jury found the evidence to be credible.
<br>(2) Discovery made prior to a ruling on a motion for summary judgment
<br>
<br>If, under applicable rules, the court permits discovery prior to a ruling on a motion for summary judgment governed by section 1604(d) of this title, such discovery shall be limited solely to establishing whether a genuine issue of material fact exists as to the applicable elements set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 1604(d) of this title.
<br>(3) Discovery with respect to a biomaterials supplier
<br>
<br>A biomaterials supplier shall be subject to discovery in connection with a motion seeking dismissal or summary judgment on the basis of the inapplicability of section 1604(d) of this title or the failure to establish the applicable elements of section 1604(d) of this title solely to the extent permitted by the applicable Federal or State rules for discovery against nonparties.
<br>(e) Dismissal with prejudice
<br>
<br>An order granting a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment pursuant to this section shall be entered with prejudice, except insofar as the moving defendant may be rejoined to the action as provided in section 1606 of this title.
<br>(f) Manufacturer conduct of litigation
<br>
<br>The manufacturer of an implant that is the subject of an action covered under this chapter shall be permitted to conduct litigation on any motion for summary judgment or dismissal filed by a biomaterials supplier who is a defendant under this section on behalf of such supplier if the manufacturer and any other defendant in such action enter into a valid and applicable contractual agreement under which the manufacturer agrees to bear the cost of such litigation or to conduct such litigation.

<br>(a) Impleading of dismissed defendant
<br>
<br>A court, upon motion by a manufacturer or a claimant within 90 days after entry of a final judgment in an action by the claimant against a manufacturer, and notwithstanding any otherwise applicable statute of limitations, may implead a biomaterials supplier who has been dismissed from the action pursuant to this chapter if—
<br>
<br>(1) the manufacturer has made an assertion, either in a motion or other pleading filed with the court or in an opening or closing statement at trial, or as part of a claim for contribution or indemnification, and the court finds based on the court's independent review of the evidence contained in the record of the action, that under applicable law—
<br>
<br>(A) the negligence or intentionally tortious conduct of the dismissed supplier was an actual and proximate cause of the harm to the claimant; and
<br>
<br>(B) the manufacturer's liability for damages should be reduced in whole or in part because of such negligence or intentionally tortious conduct; or
<br>
<br>(2) the claimant has moved to implead the supplier and the court finds, based on the court's independent review of the evidence contained in the record of the action, that under applicable law—
<br>
<br>(A) the negligence or intentionally tortious conduct of the dismissed supplier was an actual and proximate cause of the harm to the claimant; and
<br>
<br>(B) the claimant is unlikely to be able to recover the full amount of its damages from the remaining defendants.
<br>(b) Standard of liability
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any preliminary finding under subsection (a), a biomaterials supplier who has been impleaded into an action covered by this chapter, as provided for in this section—
<br>
<br>(1) may, prior to entry of judgment on the claim against it, supplement the record of the proceeding that was developed prior to the grant of the motion for impleader under subsection (a); and
<br>
<br>(2) may be found liable to a manufacturer or a claimant only to the extent required and permitted by any applicable State or Federal law other than this chapter.
<br>(c) Discovery
<br>
<br>Nothing in this section shall give a claimant or any other party the right to obtain discovery from a biomaterials supplier at any time prior to grant of a motion for impleader beyond that allowed under section 1605 of this title.

<br>
<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13165, Aug. 9, 2000, 65 F.R. 49469, as amended by Ex. Ord. No. 13286, §11, Feb. 28, 2003, 68 F.R. 10622, provided:
<br>
<br>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Office of National Drug Control [Policy] Reauthorization Act of 1998, (21 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), and in order to develop recommendations for Federal agency actions to address the use of drugs in sports, in particular among young people, it is hereby ordered as follows:
<br>
<br>Section 1. Policy. The use of drugs in sports has reached a level that endangers not just the legitimacy of athletic competition but also the lives and health of athletes—from the elite ranks to youth leagues. The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse issued in 1999 found that in just 1 year's time the rate of steroid use among young people rose roughly 50 percent among both sexes and across all age groups. It is the policy of my Administration to take the steps needed to help eliminate illicit or otherwise banned drug use and doping in sports at the State, national, and international level.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. Establishment of a White House Task Force on Drug Use in Sports. (a) There is established a White House Task Force on Drug Use in Sports (Task Force). The Task Force shall comprise the co-vice chairs of the White House Olympic Task Force (the "Olympic Task Force Vice Chairs"), and representatives designated by the Office of National Drug Control Policy, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Labor, the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports [now President's Council on Fitness, Sports, and Nutrition], the Office of Management and Budget, the National Security Council, the Department of State, the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Education, the Department of Justice, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Homeland Security, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.
<br>
<br>(b) The Task Force shall develop recommendations for the President on further executive and legislative actions that can be undertaken to address the problem of doping and drug use in sports. In developing the recommendations, the Task Force shall consider, among other things: (i) the health and safety of America's athletes, in particular our Nation's young people; (ii) the integrity of honest athletic competition; and (iii) the views and recommendations of State and local governments, the private sector, citizens, community groups, and nonprofit organizations, on actions to address this threat. The Task Force, through its Chairs, shall submit its recommendations to the President.
<br>
<br>(c) The Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (the Director), the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Olympic Task Force Vice Chairs or their designees shall serve as the Task Force Chairs.
<br>
<br>(d) To the extent permitted by law and at the request of the Chairs, agencies shall cooperate with and provide information to the Task Force.
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. Participation in the World Anti-Doping Agency. (a) As part of my Administration's efforts to address the problem of drug use in sports, the United States has played a leading role in the formation of a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) by the Olympic and sports community and the nations of the world. Through these efforts, the United States has been selected to serve as a governmental representative on the board of the WADA. This order will authorize the Director to serve as the United States Government's representative on the WADA board.
<br>
<br>(b) Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 1701 et seq., the Director, or in his absence his designee, is hereby authorized to take all necessary and proper actions to execute his responsibilities as United States representative to the WADA.
<br>
<br>(c) To assist the Director in carrying out these responsibilities as the United States Government representative to the WADA and to the extent permitted by law, Federal employees may serve in their official capacity, inter alia, on WADA Committees or WADA advisory committees, serving as experts to the WADA.
<br>
<br>1 So in original. Probably should be "Tribal".
<br>§1702. Office of National Drug Control Policy
<br>(a) Establishment of Office
<br>
<br>There is established in the Executive Office of the President an Office of National Drug Control Policy, which shall—
<br>
<br>(1) lead the national drug control effort, including coordinating with the National Drug Control Program agencies;
<br>
<br>(2) coordinate and oversee the implementation of the national drug control policy, including the National Drug Control Strategy;
<br>
<br>(3) assess and certify the adequacy of National Drug Control Programs and the budget for those programs;
<br>
<br>(4) evaluate the effectiveness of national drug control policy efforts, including the National Drug Control Program Agencies' 1 programs, by developing and applying specific goals and performance measurements and monitoring the agencies' program-level spending;
<br>
<br>(5) identify and respond to emerging drug threats related to illicit drug use;
<br>
<br>(6) administer the Drug-Free Communities Program, the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas Program, and other grant programs directly authorized to be administered by the Office in furtherance of the National Drug Control Strategy; and
<br>
<br>(7) facilitate broad-scale information sharing and data standardization among Federal, State, and local entities to support the national drug control efforts.
<br>(b) Repealed. Pub. L. 115–271, title VIII, §8222(1), Oct. 24, 2018, 132 Stat. 4142
<br>(c) Access by Congress
<br>
<br>The location of the Office in the Executive Office of the President shall not be construed as affecting access by Congress, or any committee of the House of Representatives or the Senate, to any—
<br>
<br>(1) information, document, or study in the possession of, or conducted by or at the direction of the Director; or
<br>
<br>(2) personnel of the Office.
<br>(d) Office of National Drug Control Policy Gift Fund
<br>(1) Establishment
<br>
<br>There is established in the Treasury of the United States a fund for the receipt of gifts, both real and personal, for the purpose of aiding or facilitating the work of the Office under section 1703(c) of this title.
<br>(2) Contributions
<br>
<br>The Office may accept, hold, and administer contributions to the Fund.
<br>(3) Use of amounts deposited
<br>
<br>Amounts deposited in the Fund are authorized to be appropriated, to remain available until expended for authorized purposes at the discretion of the Director.
<br>(4) Ethics guidelines
<br>
<br>The Director shall establish written guidelines setting forth the criteria to be used in determining whether a gift or donation should be declined under this subsection because the acceptance of the gift or donation would—
<br>
<br>(A) reflect unfavorably upon the ability of the Director or the Office, or any employee of the Office, to carry out responsibilities or official duties under this chapter in a fair and objective manner; or
<br>
<br>(B) compromise the integrity or the appearance of integrity of programs or services provided under this chapter or of any official involved in those programs or services.
<br>(5) Registry of gifts
<br>
<br>The Director shall maintain a list of—
<br>
<br>(A) the source and amount of each gift or donation accepted by the Office; and
<br>
<br>(B) the source and amount of each gift or donation accepted by a contractor to be used in its performance of a contract for the Office.
<br>(6) Report to Congress
<br>
<br>The Director shall include in the annual assessment under section 1705(g) of this title a copy of the registry maintained under paragraph (5).
