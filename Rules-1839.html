<br>§8127. Small business concerns owned and controlled by veterans: contracting goals and preferences
<br>
<br>(a) Contracting Goals.—(1) In order to increase contracting opportunities for small business concerns owned and controlled by veterans and small business concerns owned and controlled by veterans with service-connected disabilities, the Secretary shall—
<br>
<br>(A) establish a goal for each fiscal year for participation in Department contracts (including subcontracts) by small business concerns owned and controlled by veterans who are not veterans with service-connected disabilities in accordance with paragraph (2); and
<br>
<br>(B) establish a goal for each fiscal year for participation in Department contracts (including subcontracts) by small business concerns owned and controlled by veterans with service-connected disabilities in accordance with paragraph (3).
<br>
<br>(2) The goal for a fiscal year for participation under paragraph (1)(A) shall be determined by the Secretary.
<br>
<br>(3) The goal for a fiscal year for participation under paragraph (1)(B) shall be not less than the Government-wide goal for that fiscal year for participation by small business concerns owned and controlled by veterans with service-connected disabilities under section 15(g)(1) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 644(g)(1)).
<br>
<br>(4) The Secretary shall establish a review mechanism to ensure that, in the case of a subcontract of a Department contract that is counted for purposes of meeting a goal established pursuant to this section, the subcontract was actually awarded to a business concern that may be counted for purposes of meeting that goal.
<br>
<br>(b) Use of Noncompetitive Procedures for Certain Small Contracts.—Except as provided in subsection (d)(2), for purposes of meeting the goals under subsection (a), and in accordance with this section, in entering into a contract with a small business concern owned and controlled by veterans or a small business concern owned and controlled by veterans with service-connected disabilities for an amount less than the simplified acquisition threshold (as defined in section 134 of title 41), a contracting officer of the Department may use procedures other than competitive procedures.
<br>
<br>(c) Sole Source Contracts for Contracts Above Simplified Acquisition Threshold.—Except as provided in subsection (d)(2), for purposes of meeting the goals under subsection (a), and in accordance with this section, a contracting officer of the Department may award a contract to a small business concern owned and controlled by veterans or a small business concern owned and controlled by veterans with service-connected disabilities using procedures other than competitive procedures if—
<br>
<br>(1) such concern is determined to be a responsible source with respect to performance of such contract opportunity;
<br>
<br>(2) the anticipated award price of the contract (including options) will exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (as defined in section 134 of title 41) but will not exceed $5,000,000; and
<br>
<br>(3) in the estimation of the contracting officer, the contract award can be made at a fair and reasonable price that offers best value to the United States.
<br>
<br>(d) Use of Restricted Competition.—(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) and in subsections (b) and (c), for purposes of meeting the goals under subsection (a), and in accordance with this section, a contracting officer of the Department shall award contracts on the basis of competition restricted to small business concerns owned and controlled by veterans or small business concerns owned and controlled by veterans with service-connected disabilities if the contracting officer has a reasonable expectation that two or more small business concerns owned and controlled by veterans or small business concerns owned and controlled by veterans with service-connected disabilities will submit offers and that the award can be made at a fair and reasonable price that offers best value to the United States.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) and except as provided by subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, with respect to the procurement of a covered product or service, a contracting officer of the Department shall procure such product or service from a source designated under chapter 85 of title 41, and in accordance with the regulations prescribed under such chapter.
<br>
<br>(B)(i) Subject to clause (ii), subparagraph (A) shall not apply in the case of a covered product or service for which a contract was—
<br>
<br>(I) awarded under paragraph (1) after December 22, 2006; and
<br>
<br>(II) in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Department of Veterans Affairs Contracting Preference Consistency Act of 2020.
<br>
<br>(ii) Clause (i) shall cease to apply to a covered product or service described in such clause upon a determination of the Secretary that when the current contract for the covered product or service is terminated or expires there is no reasonable expectation that—
<br>
<br>(I) two or more small business concerns owned and controlled by veterans will submit offers as described in paragraph (1); and
<br>
<br>(II) the award can be made at a fair and reasonable price that offers best value to the United States.
<br>
<br>(C) In this paragraph, the term "covered product or service" means—
<br>
<br>(i) a product or service that—
<br>
<br>(I) is included on the procurement list under section 8503(a) of title 41; and
<br>
<br>(II) was included on such procurement list on or before December 22, 2006; or
<br>
<br>(ii) a product or service that—
<br>
<br>(I) is a replacement for a product or service described under clause (i);
<br>
<br>(II) is essentially the same and meeting the same requirement as the product or service being replaced; and
<br>
<br>(III) a contracting officer determines meets the quality standards and delivery schedule of the Department.
<br>
<br>(e) Eligibility of Small Business Concerns.—A small business concern may be awarded a contract under this section only if the small business concern and the veteran owner of the small business concern are listed in the database of veteran-owned businesses maintained by the Secretary under subsection (f).
<br>
<br>(f) Database of Veteran-Owned Businesses.—(1) Subject to paragraphs (2) through (6), the Secretary shall maintain a database of small business concerns owned and controlled by veterans, small business concerns owned and controlled by veterans with service-connected disabilities, and the veteran owners of such business concerns.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) To be eligible for inclusion in the database, such a veteran shall submit to the Secretary such information as the Secretary may require with respect to the small business concern or the veteran. Application for inclusion in the database shall constitute permission under section 552a of title 5 (commonly referred to as the Privacy Act) for the Secretary to access such personal information maintained by the Secretary as may be necessary to verify the information contained in the application.
<br>
<br>(B) If the Secretary receives an application for inclusion in the database from an individual whose status as a veteran cannot be verified because the Secretary does not maintain information with respect to the veteran status of the individual, the Secretary may not include the small business concern owned and controlled by the individual in the database maintained by the Secretary until the Secretary receives such information as may be necessary to verify that the individual is a veteran.
<br>
<br>(3) Information maintained in the database shall be submitted on a voluntary basis by such veterans.
<br>
<br>(4) No small business concern may be listed in the database until the Secretary has verified, using regulations issued by the Administrator of the Small Business Administration with respect to the status of the concern as a small business concern and the ownership and control of such concern, that—
<br>
<br>(A) the small business concern is owned and controlled by veterans; and
<br>
<br>(B) in the case of a small business concern for which the person who owns and controls the concern indicates that the person is a veteran with a service-connected disability, that the person is a veteran with a service-connected disability.
<br>
<br>(5) The Secretary shall make the database available to all Federal departments and agencies and shall notify each such department and agency of the availability of the database.
<br>
<br>(6) If the Secretary determines that the public dissemination of certain types of information maintained in the database is inappropriate, the Secretary shall take such steps as are necessary to maintain such types of information in a secure and confidential manner.
<br>
<br>(7) The Secretary may not issue regulations related to the status of a concern as a small business concern and the ownership and control of such small business concern.
<br>
<br>(8)(A) If a small business concern is not included in the database because the Secretary does not verify the status of the concern as a small business concern or the ownership or control of the concern, the concern may appeal the denial of verification to the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Small Business Administration (as established under section 5(i) of the Small Business Act). The decision of the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall be considered a final agency action.
<br>
<br>(B)(i) If an interested party challenges the inclusion in the database of a small business concern owned and controlled by veterans or a small business concern owned and controlled by veterans with service-connected disabilities based on the status of the concern as a small business concern or the ownership or control of the concern, the challenge shall be heard by the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Small Business Administration as described in subparagraph (A). The decision of the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall be considered final agency action.
<br>
<br>(ii) In this subparagraph, the term "interested party" means—
<br>
<br>(I) the Secretary; or
<br>
<br>(II) in the case of a small business concern that is awarded a contract, the contracting officer of the Department or another small business concern that submitted an offer for the contract that was awarded to the small business concern that is the subject of a challenge made under clause (i).
<br>
<br>(C) For each fiscal year, the Secretary shall reimburse the Administrator of the Small Business Administration in an amount necessary to cover any cost incurred by the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Small Business Administration for actions taken by the Office under this paragraph. The Administrator is authorized to accept such reimbursement. The amount of any such reimbursement shall be determined jointly by the Secretary and the Administrator and shall be provided from fees collected by the Secretary under multiple-award schedule contracts. Any disagreement about the amount shall be resolved by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
<br>
<br>(g) Enforcement Penalties for Misrepresentation.—(1) Any business concern that is determined by the Secretary to have willfully and intentionally misrepresented the status of that concern as a small business concern owned and controlled by veterans or as a small business concern owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans for purposes of this subsection shall be debarred from contracting with the Department for a period of not less than five years.
<br>

<br>
<br>(3) The debarment of a business concern under paragraph (1) includes the debarment of all principals in the business concern for a period of not less than five years.

<br>
<br>(A) specify the exact performance requirements applicable under such paragraph; and

<br>
<br>(2)(A) To be eligible for inclusion in the database, such a veteran shall submit to the Administrator such information as the Administrator may require with respect to the small business concern or the veteran.

<br>(5) If the Administrator determines that the public dissemination of certain types of information maintained in the database is inappropriate, the Administrator shall take such steps as are necessary to maintain such types of information in a secure and confidential manner.
<br>
<br>(6)(A) If a small business concern is not included in the database because the Administrator does not certify the status of the concern as a small business concern owned and controlled by veterans (under section 36A) or a small business concern owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans (under subsection (g) of this section), the concern may appeal the denial of certification to the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Administration (as established under section 5(i)). The decision of the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall be considered a final agency action.
<br>
<br>(B)(i) If an interested party challenges the inclusion in the database of a small business concern owned and controlled by veterans or a small business concern owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans based on the status of the concern as a small business concern or the ownership or control of the concern, the challenge shall be heard by the Office of Hearings and Appeals as described in subparagraph (A). The decision of the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall be considered final agency action.
<br>
<br>(ii) In this subparagraph, the term "interested party" means—
<br>
<br>(I) the Secretary of Veterans Affairs or the Administrator; or
<br>
<br>(II) in the case of a small business concern that is awarded a contract, the applicable contracting officer or another small business concern that submitted an offer for the contract that was awarded to the small business concern that is the subject of a challenge made under clause (i).

<br>(a)(1) The Secretary shall prescribe regulations for the purposes of this subchapter.
<br>
<br>(2) In those regulations, the Secretary shall prescribe for each State the number of nursing home and domiciliary beds for which assistance under this subchapter may be furnished. Such regulations shall be based on projected demand for such care 10 years after the date of the enactment of the Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act by veterans who at such time are 65 years of age or older and who reside in that State. In determining such projected demand, the Secretary shall take into account travel distances for veterans and their families.
<br>
<br>(3)(A) In those regulations, the Secretary shall establish criteria under which the Secretary shall determine, with respect to an application for assistance under this subchapter for a project described in subparagraph (B) which is from a State that has a need for additional beds as determined under subsections (a)(2) and (d)(1), whether the need for such beds is most aptly characterized as great, significant, or limited. Such criteria shall take into account the availability of beds already operated by the Secretary and other providers which appropriately serve the needs which the State proposes to meet with its application.
<br>
<br>(B) This paragraph applies to a project for the construction or acquisition of a new State home facility, a project to increase the number of beds available at a State home facility, and a project to replace beds at a State home facility.
<br>
<br>(4) The Secretary shall review and, as necessary, revise regulations prescribed under paragraphs (2) and (3) not less often than every four years.
<br>
<br>(b) The Secretary shall prescribe the following by regulation:
<br>
<br>(1) General standards of construction, repair, and equipment for facilities constructed or acquired with assistance received under this subchapter.
<br>
<br>(2) General standards for the furnishing of care in facilities which are constructed or acquired with assistance received under this subchapter, which standards shall be no less stringent than those standards prescribed by the Secretary pursuant to section 1720(b) of this title.
<br>
<br>(c) The Secretary may inspect any State facility constructed or acquired with assistance received under this subchapter at such times as the Secretary deems necessary to insure that such facility meets the standards prescribed under subsection (b)(2).
<br>
<br>(d)(1) In prescribing regulations to carry out this subchapter, the Secretary shall provide that in the case of a State that seeks assistance under this subchapter for a project described in subsection (a)(3)(B), the determination of the unmet need for beds for State homes in that State shall be reduced by the number of beds in all previous applications submitted by that State under this subchapter, including beds which have not been recognized by the Secretary under section 1741 of this title.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) Financial assistance under this subchapter for a renovation project may only be provided for a project for which the total cost of construction is in excess of $400,000 (as adjusted from time-to-time in such regulations to reflect changes in costs of construction).
<br>
<br>(B) For purposes of this paragraph, a renovation project is a project to remodel or alter existing buildings for which financial assistance under this subchapter may be provided and does not include maintenance and repair work which is the responsibility of the State.

<br>
<br>1992—Pub. L. 102–585 substituted "If, within the 20-year period beginning on the date of the approval by the Secretary of the final architectural and engineering inspection of any project" for "If, within 20 years after completion of any project" and "the facilities covered by the project cease" for "such facilities cease".
