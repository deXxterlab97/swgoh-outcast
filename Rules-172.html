<br>
<br>Paragraphs (100)–(116) are added on authority of former section 2211(g) which authorized the President to place, from Aug. 15, 1964, to Feb. 1, 1965, not more than 30 positions in Levels IV and V of the Federal Executive Salary Schedule.

<br>
<br>The deletion of paragraphs (22), (38), and (83) of 5 U.S.C. 5316 reflects (1) the termination, effective June 30, 1965, of the position of "Area Redevelopment Administrator, Department of Commerce" pursuant to Public Law 87–27 (sec. 29, 75 Stat. 63; 42 U.S.C. 2525); (2) the abolition of the position of "Chief, Weather Bureau, Department of Commerce" by 1965 Reorganization Plan No. 2 (sec. 2(a), 79 Stat. 1318); and (3) the abolition of the position of "General Counsel of the Housing and Home Finance Agency" by Public Law 89–174 (sec. 5(a), 9(c), 79 Stat. 669, 671).
