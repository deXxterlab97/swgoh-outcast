<br>
<br>(B) For purposes of this paragraph, the years of service of a member as an air weapons controller shall be computed, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, from the date the member begins training leading to a designation as an air weapons controller, but there shall be excluded from such computation any period of more than 90 days during which the member performs primary duties other than as an air weapons controller.
<br>
<br>(d)(1) In time of war, the President may suspend the payment of incentive pay for any hazardous duty described in subsection (a).
<br>
<br>(2) A member is entitled to not more than two payments of incentive pay, authorized by this section, for a period of time during which he qualifies for more than one payment of that pay.
<br>
<br>(e) A member of a uniformed service who is entitled to basic pay may be paid incentive pay under this subsection, at a monthly rate not to exceed $150, for any month during which the member performs duty involving regular participation as a firefighting crew member, as determined by the Secretary concerned.
<br>
<br>(f)(1) Under regulations prescribed by the President and to the extent provided for by appropriations, when a member of a reserve component of a uniformed service, or of the National Guard, who is entitled to compensation under section 206 of this title, performs, under orders, any duty described in subsection (a) for members entitled to basic pay, he is entitled to an increase in compensation equal to 1/30 of the monthly incentive pay authorized by subsection (b) or (c), as the case may be, for the performance of that hazardous duty by a member of a corresponding grade who is entitled to basic pay. He is entitled to the increase for as long as he is qualified for it, for each regular period of instruction, or period of appropriate duty, at which he is engaged for at least two hours, including that performed on a Sunday or holiday, or for the performance of such other equivalent training, instruction, duty, or appropriate duties, as the Secretary may prescribe under section 206(a) of this title. This subsection does not apply to a member who is entitled to basic pay under section 204 of this title for the entire month.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) If in any calendar month a member performs duty as described in paragraph (1) and while entitled to basic pay also performs hazardous duty as described in the same paragraph of subsection (a) as constitutes the predicate for his entitlement under paragraph (1), the earned units of measuring entitlement for incentive pay under this section shall be combined. If the sum of units determined under the preceding sentence equals or exceeds the minimum standard prescribed by the President for entitlement to pay specified under subsections (b) and (c) for a member of corresponding grade who is entitled to basic pay for the entire relevant month, the member shall be entitled to an increase in compensation equal to 1/30 of the monthly incentive pay authorized by subsection (b) or (c) for the performance of that hazardous duty by a member of corresponding grade who is entitled to basic pay for the entire month.
<br>
<br>(B) A member who qualifies for entitlement under this paragraph is entitled to the increase for each day in the relevant month in which he is entitled to basic pay pursuant to section 204 of this title or to compensation under section 206 of this title.
<br>
<br>(C) In this paragraph, the term "units" means the significant increments of performance prescribed as qualifying standards in regulations promulgated by the President pursuant to this section.

<br>
<br>In subsection (a), the words "is also entitled" are substituted for the words "shall, in addition thereto, be entitled". The words "For the purposes of this subsection" are inserted for clarity. The word "competent" is omitted as surplusage.
<br>
<br>In subsection (b), the words preceding the tables are substituted for section 235(b) (words preceding tables) of existing title 37. The words "Years of service computed under section 205" are inserted in the tables for clarity.
<br>
<br>In subsection (f), the words "a member of a reserve component of a uniformed service, or of the National Guard" are substituted for the enumeration of the organizations concerned in section 301(d) of existing title 37. The words "when . . . performs, under orders, any duty described in subsection (a)(1)–(11) for members entitled to basic pay" are substituted for the words "when required by competent orders to perform any hazardous duty prescribed by or pursuant to section 235 of this title for members of the uniformed services entitled to receive basic pay and when in consequence of such orders they do perform any hazardous duty so prescribed". The last sentence is substituted for section 301(e) (as applicable to (d)) of existing title 37.
<br>
<br>In subsection (g), the words "entitled to incentive pay under section 301(a)(1) of this title" are substituted for the words "flight pay". At the time of the enactment of the source statute, additional pay was authorized as "flight pay". However, the Career Compensation Act of 1949 did not authorize "flight pay" but provided incentive pay in section 204(a)(1) [now section 301(a)(1) of this revised title] for "duty as a crew member . . . involving frequent and regular participation in aerial flight". The words "before January 2 of each year" are substituted for the words "On or before January 1, annually". The word "grade" is substituted for the word "rank" to conform to the definition in section 101(15) of this revised title.

<br>
<br>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 301, 301a, and 301c of title 37, United States Code, and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:
<br>
<br>Section 1. The Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Secretary of Homeland Security with respect to the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in the Navy, with respect to members of the uniformed services under their respective jurisdictions, are hereby designated and empowered to exercise, without approval, ratification, or other action by the President, the authority vested in the President by sections 301, 301a, and 301c of title 37, United States Code. The Secretaries shall consult each other in the exercise of such authority to ensure similar treatment for similarly situated members of the uniformed services unless the needs of their respective uniformed services require differing treatment.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. Executive Order 11157 of June 22, 1964, as amended, and Executive Order 11800 of August 17, 1974, as amended, are hereby revoked.
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. This order is not intended to create, nor does it create, any right, benefit, or privilege, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party against the United States, its agencies, officers, employees, or any other person.
<br>
<br>George W. Bush.      
<br>§301a. Incentive pay: aviation career
<br>
<br>(a)(1) Subject to regulations prescribed by the President, a member of a uniformed service who is entitled to basic pay is also entitled to aviation career incentive pay in the amount set forth in subsection (b) for the frequent and regular performance of operational or proficiency flying duty required by orders.
<br>
<br>(2) Aviation career incentive pay shall be restricted to regular and reserve officers who hold, or are in training leading to, an aeronautical rating or designation and who engage and remain in aviation service on a career basis.
<br>
<br>(3) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Homeland Security with respect to the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in the Navy, or the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Health and Human Services with respect to members under their respective jurisdiction, an officer (except a flight surgeon or other medical officer) who is entitled to basic pay, holds an aeronautical rating or designation, and is qualified for aviation service under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, is entitled to continuous monthly incentive pay in the amount set forth in subsection (b) that is applicable to him. A flight surgeon or other medical officer who is entitled to basic pay, holds an aeronautical rating or designation, and is qualified for aviation service under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, is not entitled to continuous monthly incentive pay but is entitled to monthly incentive pay in the amounts set forth in subsection (b) for the frequent and regular performance of operational flying duty.
<br>
<br>(4) To be entitled to continuous monthly incentive pay, an officer must perform the prescribed operational flying duties (including flight training but excluding proficiency flying) for 8 of the first 12, and 12 of the first 18 years of the aviation service of the officer. However, if an officer performs the prescribed operational flying duties (including flight training but excluding proficiency flying) for at least 10 but less than 12 of the first 18 years of the aviation service of the officer, the officer will be entitled to continuous monthly incentive pay for the first 22 years of aviation service of the officer. Entitlement to continuous monthly incentive pay ceases for an officer (other than a warrant officer) upon completion of 25 years of aviation service, but such an officer in a pay grade below pay grade O–7 remains entitled to monthly incentive pay under subsection (b)(1) for the performance of operational flying duty.
<br>
<br>(5) If upon completion of either 12 or 18 years of aviation service it is determined that an officer has failed to perform the minimum prescribed operational flying duty requirements during the prescribed periods of time, his entitlement to continuous monthly incentive pay ceases. For the needs of the service, the Secretary concerned may permit, on a case by case basis, an officer to continue to receive continuous monthly incentive pay despite the failure of the officer to perform the prescribed operational flying duty requirements during the prescribed periods of time so long as the officer has performed those requirements for not less than 6 years of aviation service. The Secretary concerned may not delegate the authority in the preceding sentence to permit the payment of incentive pay under this subsection. If at the completion of 12 years of aviation service entitlement to continuous monthly incentive pay ceases, entitlement to that pay may again commence at the completion of 18 years of aviation service upon completion of the minimum operational flying duty requirements, such pay to continue for a period of time as prescribed in accordance with this section. However, if entitlement to continuous monthly incentive pay ceases in the case of any officer at the completion of either 12 or 18 years of aviation service, such officer remains entitled to monthly incentive pay for the performance of subsequent operational or proficiency flying duties up to the maximum period of time prescribed in accordance with this section.
<br>
<br>(6) In this section:
<br>
<br>(A) The term "aviation service" means service performed by an officer (except a flight surgeon or other medical officer) while holding an aeronautical rating or designation or while in training to receive an aeronautical rating or designation.
<br>
<br>(B) The term "operational flying duty" means flying performed under competent orders by rated or designated members while serving in assignments in which basic flying skills normally are maintained in the performance of assigned duties as determined by the Secretary concerned, and flying performed by members in training that leads to the award of an aeronautical rating or designation.
<br>
<br>(C) The term "proficiency flying duty" means flying performed under competent orders by rated or designated members while serving in assignments in which such skills would normally not be maintained in the performance of assigned duties.
<br>
<br>(D) The term "officer" includes an individual enlisted, and designated, as an aviation cadet under section 8411 of title 10.
<br>
<br>(b)(1) A member who satisfies the requirements described in subsection (a) is entitled to monthly incentive pay as follows:
<br>  Years of aviation service (including
<br>
<br> flight training) as an officer:
<br>	Monthly rate
<br>2 or less 	$125
<br>Over 2 	$156
<br>Over 3 	$188
<br>Over 4 	$206
<br>Over 6 	$650
<br>Over 14 	$840
<br>Over 22 	$585
<br>Over 23 	$495
<br>Over 24 	$385
<br>Over 25 	$250
<br>
<br>(2) An officer in a pay grade above O–6 is entitled, until the officer completes 25 years of aviation service, to be paid at the rates set forth in the table in paragraph (1), except that—
<br>
<br>(A) an officer in pay grade O–7 may not be paid at a rate greater than $200 a month; and
<br>
<br>(B) an officer in pay grade O–8 or above may not be paid at a rate greater than $206 a month.
<br>
<br>(3) For a warrant officer with over 22, 23, 24, or 25 years of aviation service who is qualified under subsection (a), the rate prescribed in the table in paragraph (1) for officers with over 14 years of aviation service shall continue to apply to the warrant officer.
<br>
<br>(4) An officer serving as an air battle manager who is entitled to aviation career incentive pay under this section and who, before becoming entitled to aviation career incentive pay, was entitled to incentive pay under section 301(a)(13) of this title, shall be paid the monthly incentive pay at the higher of the following rates:
<br>
<br>(A) The rate otherwise applicable to the member under this subsection.
<br>
<br>(B) The rate at which the member was receiving incentive pay under section 301(c)(2)(A) of this title immediately before the member's entitlement to aviation career incentive pay under this section.
<br>
<br>(c) In time of war, the President may suspend the payment of aviation career incentive pay.
<br>
<br>(d) Under regulations prescribed by the President and to the extent provided for by appropriations, when a member of a reserve component of a uniformed service, or of the National Guard, who is entitled to compensation under section 206 of this title, performs, under orders, duty described in subsection (a) for members entitled to basic pay, he is entitled to an increase in compensation equal to 1/30 of the monthly incentive pay authorized by subsection (b) for the performance of that duty by a member with corresponding years of aviation service who is entitled to basic pay. Such member is entitled to the increase for as long as he is qualified for it, for each regular period of instruction, or period of appropriate duty, at which he is engaged for at least two hours, including that performed on a Sunday or holiday, or for the performance of such other equivalent training, instruction, duty or appropriate duties, as the Secretary may prescribe under section 206(a) of this title. This subsection does not apply to a member who is entitled to basic pay under section 204 of this title.

<br>
<br>(3) To be entitled to continuous monthly submarine duty incentive pay through 26 years of service (as computed under section 205 of this title, but excluding, in the case of an officer, periods as an enlisted member before initial appointment as an officer), a member must perform operational submarine duties for at least 6 of the first 12, and at least 10 of the first 18, years of his submarine service.

<br>
<br>(4) If upon completion of either 12 or 18 years of submarine service it is determined that a member has failed to perform the minimum prescribed operational submarine duty requirements during the prescribed periods of time, his entitlement to continuous monthly submarine duty incentive pay ceases. If entitlement to continuous monthly submarine duty incentive pay ceases upon completion of 12 years of submarine service, entitlement to that pay may again commence upon completion of 18 years of submarine service if the minimum operational submarine duty requirements have been met, and such pay shall continue for the period of time prescribed in accordance with this section. However, if entitlement to continuous monthly submarine duty incentive pay ceases in the case of any member at the completion of either 12 or 18 years of submarine service or 26 years of service (as computed under section 205 of this title, but excluding, in the case of an officer, periods as an enlisted member before initial appointment as an officer), such member shall be entitled to that pay in the amount prescribed pursuant to subsection (b) for the performance of subsequent operational submarine duty, or for the performance of service as a member of a submarine operational command staff, if such member's duties require serving on a submarine during underway operations.
