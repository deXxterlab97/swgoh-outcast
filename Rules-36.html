<br>dreams and vanities there are also many words; but fear thou God.
<br>7If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and the violent perverting of justice and righteousness in the state, marvel not at the matter; for one higher than the high watcheth, and there are higher than they. 8But the profit of a land every way is a king that maketh himself servant to the field.
<br>9He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance, with increase; this also is vanity. 10When goods increase, they are increased that eat them; and what advantage is there to the owner thereof, saving the beholding of them with his eyes?
<br>11Sweet is the sleep of a labouring man, whether he eat little or much; but the satiety of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.
<br>12There is a grievous evil which I have seen under the sun, namely, riches kept by the owner thereof to his hurt; 13and those riches perish by evil adventure; and if he hath begotten a son, there is nothing in his hand. 14As he came forth of his mother’s womb, naked shall he go back as he came, and shall take nothing for his labour, which he may carry away in his hand. 15And this also is a grievous evil, that in all points as he came, so shall he go; and what profit hath he that he laboureth for the wind? 16All his days also he eateth in darkness, and he hath much vexation and sickness and wrath.
<br> 
<br>17Behold that which I have seen: it is good, yea, it is comely for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy pleasure for all his labour, wherein he laboureth under the sun, all the days of his life which God hath given him; for this is his portion. 18Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labour—this is the gift of God. 19For let him remember the days of his life that they are not many; for God answereth him in the joy of his heart.
<br>There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and   it   is   heavy upon men: 2a man to whom God giveth riches, wealth, and honour, so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a stranger eateth it; this is vanity, and it is an evil disease. 3If a man beget a hundred children, and live many years, so that the days of his years are many, but his soul have not enough of good, and moreover he have no burial; I say, that an untimely birth is better than he; 4for it cometh in vanity, and departeth in darkness, and the name thereof is covered with darkness; 5moreover it hath not seen the sun nor known it; this hath gratification rather than the other; 6yea, though he live a thousand years twice told, and enjoy no good;
<br>do not all go to one place?
<br>7All the labour of man is for his mouth,
<br>And yet the appetite is not filled.
<br> 
<br>8For what advantage hath the wise more than the fool? or the poor man that hath understanding, in walking before the living? 9Better is the seeing of the eyes than the wandering of the desire; this also is vanity and a striving after wind.
<br>10Whatsoever cometh into being, the name thereof was given long ago, and it is foreknown what man is; neither can he contend with Him that is mightier than he. 11Seeing there are many words that increase vanity, what is man the better? 12For who knoweth what is good for man in his life, all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?
<br>
<br>A good name is better than precious oil;
<br>And the day of death than the day of one’s birth.
<br>2It is better to go to the house of mourning,
<br>Than to go to the house of feasting; For that is the end of all men,
<br>And the living will lay it to his heart.
<br>3Vexation is better than laughter;
<br>For by the sadness of the countenance the heart may be gladdened.
<br>4The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning;
<br>But the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.
<br>5It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise,
<br> 
<br>Than for a man to hear the song of fools.
<br>6For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool; this also is vanity.
<br>7Surely oppression turneth a wise man into a fool;
<br>And a gift destroyeth the understanding.
<br>8Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof;
<br>And the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.
<br>9Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry;
<br>For anger resteth in the bosom of fools.
<br>10Say not thou: ‘How was it that the former days were better than these?’ for it is not out of wisdom that thou inquirest concerning this.
<br>11Wisdom is good with an inheritance,
<br>Yea, a profit to them that see the sun.
<br>12For wisdom is a defence, even as money is a defence; but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom preserveth the life of him that hath it.
<br>13Consider the work of God; for who can make that straight, which He hath made crooked? 14In the day of prosperity be joyful, and in the day of adversity consider; God hath made even the one as well as the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.
<br>15All things have I seen in the days of my vanity; there is a righteous man
<br> 
<br>that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his evil-doing. 16Be not righteous overmuch; neither make thyself overwise; why shouldest thou destroy thyself? 17Be not overmuch wicked, neither be thou foolish; why shouldest thou die before thy time? 18It is good that thou shouldest take hold of the one; yea, also from the other withdraw not thy hand; for he that feareth God shall discharge himself of them all.
<br>19Wisdom is a stronghold to the wise man more than ten rulers that are in a city. 20For there is not a righteous man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.
<br>21Also take not heed unto all words that are spoken, lest thou hear thy servant curse thee; 22for oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.
<br>23All this have I tried by wisdom; I said: ‘I will get wisdom’; but it was far from me. 24That which is is far off, and exceeding deep; who can find it out? 25I turned about, and applied my heart to know and to search out, and to seek wisdom and the reason of things, and to know wickedness to be folly, and foolishness to be madness; 26and I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands as bands; whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her. 27Behold, this have I found, saith Koheleth, adding one thing to another, to find out the
<br> 
<br>account; 28which yet my soul sought, but I found not; one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found. 29Behold, this only have I found, that God made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.
<br>
<br>Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a
<br>thing?
<br>A man’s wisdom maketh his face to shine,
<br>And the boldness of his face is changed.
<br>2I [counsel thee]: keep the king’s command, and that in regard of the oath of God. 3Be not hasty to go out of his presence; stand not in an evil thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him. 4Forasmuch as the king’s word hath power; and who may say unto him: ‘What doest thou?’
<br>5Whoso keepeth the commandment shall know no evil thing;
<br>And a wise man’s heart discerneth time and judgment.
<br>6For to every matter there is a time and judgment; for the evil of man is great upon him. 7For he knoweth not that which shall be; for even when it cometh to pass, who shall declare it unto him? 8There is no man that hath power over the wind to retain the wind; neither hath he power over the day of death; and there is no discharge in war; neither shall wickedness deliver him that is given to it. 9All this have I seen, even applied my heart
<br> 
<br>thereto, whatever the work that is done under the sun; what time one man had power over another to his hurt.
<br>10And so I saw the wicked buried, and they entered into their rest; but they that had done right went away from the holy place, and were forgotten in the city; this also is vanity. 11Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil; 12because a sinner doeth evil a hundred times, and prolongeth his days—though yet I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, that fear before Him; 13but it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow, because he feareth not before God. 14There is a vanity which is done upon the earth: that there are righteous men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there are wicked men, to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous—I said that this also is vanity. 15So I commended mirth, that a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry, and that this should accompany him in his labour all the days of his life which God hath given him under the sun.
<br>16When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth—for neither day nor night do men see sleep with their eyes—17then I beheld all the work of God, that man cannot find out the
<br> 
<br>work that is done under the sun; because though a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea further, though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.
<br>For all this I laid to my heart, even to make clear all this: that
<br>the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God; whether it be love or hatred, man knoweth it not; all is before them. 2All things come alike to all; there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth and to him that sacrificeth not; as is the good, so is the sinner, and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath. 3This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that there is one event unto all; yea also, the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead.
<br>4For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope; for a living dog is better than a dead lion. 5For the living know that they shall die; but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten. 6As well their love, as their hatred and their envy, is long ago perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun.
<br>
<br>7Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy,
<br>And drink thy wine with a merry heart;
<br> 
<br>For God hath already accepted thy works.
<br>8Let thy garments be always white; And let thy head lack no oil.
<br>9Enjoy life with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which He hath given thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity; for that is thy portion in life, and in thy labour wherein thou labourest under the sun. 10Whatsoever thy hand attaineth to do by thy strength, that do; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.
<br>11I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all. 12For man also knoweth not his time; as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare, even so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them.
<br>13This also have I seen as wisdom under the sun, and it seemed great unto me: 14there was a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it; 15now there was found in it a man poor and wise, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man. 16Then said I:
<br> 
<br>‘Wisdom	is	better	than	strength; nevertheless the poor man’s wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.’ 17The words of the wise spoken in
<br>quiet
<br>Are more acceptable than the cry of a ruler among fools.
<br>18Wisdom is better than weapons of war;
<br>But one sinner destroyeth much good.
<br>Dead flies make the ointment of the perfumer fetid and putrid;
<br>So doth a little folly outweigh wisdom and honour.
<br>2A wise man’s understanding is at his right hand;
<br>But a fool’s understanding at his left. 3Yea also, when a fool walketh by the way, his understanding faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a fool.
<br>
<br>4If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee,
<br>Leave not thy place;
<br>For gentleness allayeth great offences.
<br>5There is an evil which I have seen under the sun,
<br>Like an error which proceedeth from a ruler:
<br>6Folly is set on great heights, And the rich sit in low place.
<br>7I have seen servants upon horses,
<br>And princes walking as servants upon the earth.
<br> 
<br>8He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it;
<br>And whoso breaketh through a fence, a serpent shall bite him.
<br>9Whoso quarrieth stones shall be hurt therewith;
<br>And he that cleaveth wood is endangered thereby.
<br>10If the iron be blunt,
<br>And one do not whet the edge, Then must he put to more strength; But wisdom is profitable to direct. 11If the serpent bite before it is
<br>charmed,
<br>Then the charmer hath no advantage.
<br>
<br>12The words of a wise man’s mouth are gracious;
<br>But the lips of a fool will swallow up himself.
<br>13The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness;
<br>And the end of his talk is grievous madness.
<br>14A fool also multiplieth words;
<br>Yet man knoweth not what shall be; And that which shall be after him, Who can tell him?
<br>15The labour of fools wearieth every one of them,
<br>For he knoweth not how to go to the city.
<br>
<br>16Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a boy,
<br>And thy princes feast in the morning!
<br> 
<br>17Happy art thou, O land, when thy king is a free man,
<br>And thy princes eat in due season, In strength, and not in drunkenness!
<br>
<br>18By slothfulness the rafters sink in;
<br>And through idleness of the hands the house leaketh.
<br>
<br>19A feast is made for laughter, And wine maketh glad the life; And money answereth all things.
<br>
<br>20Curse not the king, no, not in thy thought,
<br>And curse not the rich in thy bedchamber;
<br>For a bird of the air shall carry the voice,
<br>And that which hath wings shall tell the matter.
<br>
<br>Cast thy bread upon the waters,
<br>For thou shalt find it after many days.
<br>2Divide a portion into seven, yea, even into eight;
<br>For thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth.
<br>3If the clouds be full of rain,
<br>They empty themselves upon the earth;
<br>And if a tree fall in the south, or in the north,
<br>In the place where the tree falleth, there shall it be.
<br>4He that observeth the wind shall not sow;
<br> 
<br>And he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap.
<br>5As thou knowest not what is the way of the wind,
<br>Nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child;
<br>Even so thou knowest not the work of God
<br>Who doeth all things.
<br>6In the morning sow thy seed,
<br>And in the evening withhold not thy hand;
<br>For thou knowest not which shall prosper, whether this or that,
<br>Or whether they both shall be alike good.
<br>7And the light is sweet,
<br>And a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun.
<br>8For if a man live many years, Let him rejoice in them all,
<br>And remember the days of darkness, For they shall be many.
<br>All that cometh is vanity.
<br>
<br>9Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth;
<br>And let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth,
<br>And walk in the ways of thy heart, And in the sight of thine eyes;
<br>But know thou, that for all these things
<br>God will bring thee into judgment.
<br>10Therefore remove vexation from thy heart,
<br>And put away evil from thy flesh; For childhood and youth are vanity.
<br> 
<br>Remember then thy Creator in the days of thy youth,
<br>Before the evil days come,
<br>And the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say:
<br>‘I have no pleasure in them’;
<br>2Before the sun, and the light, and the moon,
<br>And the stars, are darkened,
<br>And the clouds return after the rain;
<br>3In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble,
<br>And the strong men shall bow themselves,
<br>And the grinders cease because they are few,
<br>And those that look out shall be darkened in the windows,
<br>4And the doors shall be shut in the street,
<br>When the sound of the grinding is low;
<br>And one shall start up at the voice of a bird,
<br>And all the daughters of music shall be brought low;
<br>5Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high,
<br>And terrors shall be in the way; And the almond-tree shall blossom,
<br>And the grasshopper shall drag itself along,
<br>And the caperberry shall fail;
<br>Because man goeth to his long home,
<br>And the mourners go about the streets;
<br>6Before the silver cord is snapped asunder,
<br> 
<br>And the golden bowl is shattered,
<br>And the pitcher is broken at the fountain,
<br>And the wheel falleth shattered, into the pit;
<br>7And the dust returneth to the earth as it was,
<br>And the spirit returneth unto God who gave it.
<br>8Vanity of vanities, saith Koheleth; all is vanity.
<br>
<br>9And besides that Koheleth was wise, he also taught the people knowledge; yea, he pondered, and sought out, and set in order many proverbs. 10Koheleth sought to find out words of delight, and that which was written uprightly, even words of truth.
<br>11The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails well fastened are those that are composed in collections; they are given from one shepherd. 12And furthermore, my son, be admonished: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh.
<br>13The end of the matter, all having been heard: fear God, and keep His commandments; for this is the whole man. 14For God shall bring every work into the judgment concerning every hidden thing, whether it be good or whether it be evil.
<br>
<br>The end of the matter, all having been heard: fear God, and keep His Commandments; for this is the whole man.
<br> 
<br>אסתר
<br>ESTHER
<br> 
<br>NOW IT came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus—this		is	Ahasuerus who reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, over a hundred and seven and twenty provinces— 2that in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the castle, 3in the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the army of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him; 4when he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty, many days, even a hundred and fourscore days. 5And when these days were fulfilled, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the castle, both great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king’s palace; 6there were hangings of white, fine cotton, and blue, bordered with cords of fine linen and purple, upon silver rods and pillars of marble; the couches were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of green, and white, and shell, and onyx marble. 7And they gave them drink in vessels of gold— the vessels being diverse one from another—and	royal		wine	in abundance, according to the bounty of the king. 8And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel; for so the king had appointed to all the
<br> 
<br>officers of his house, that they should do according to every man’s pleasure. 9Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus. 10On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded		Mehuman,		Bizzetha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that ministered in the presence of Ahasuerus the king, 11to bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to show the peoples and the princes her beauty; for she was fair to look on. 12But the queen Vashti refused	to	come	at	the	king’s commandment by the chamberlains; therefore was the king very wroth, and
<br>his anger burned in him.
<br>13Then the king said to the wise men, who knew the times—for so was the king’s manner toward all that knew law and judgment; 14and the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish,	Meres,	Marsena,	and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king’s face, and sat the first in the kingdom: 15’What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, forasmuch as she hath not done the bidding of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?’ 16And Memucan   answered   before the king and the princes: ‘Vashti the
<br> 
<br>queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the peoples, that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus. 17For this deed of the queen will come abroad unto all women, to make their husbands contemptible in their eyes, when it will be said: The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not. 18And this day will the princesses of Persia and Media who have heard of the deed of the queen say the like unto all the king’s princes. So will there arise enough contempt and wrath. 19If it please the king, let there go forth a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, that Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus, and that the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she. 20And when the king’s decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his kingdom, great though it be, all the wives will give to their husbands honour, both to great and small.’ 21And the word pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan; 22for he sent letters into all the king’s provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and speak according to the language of his people.
<br> 
<br>After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was assuaged, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her. 2Then said the king’s servants that ministered unto him: ‘Let there be sought for the king young virgins fair to look on; 3and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the castle, to the house of the women, unto the custody of aHegai the king’s chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their ointments be given them; 4and let the maiden that pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti.’ And the thing
<br>pleased the king; and he did so.
<br>5There was a certain Jew in Shushan the castle, whose name was Mordecai the son of Jair the son of Shimei the son of Kish, a Benjamite, 6who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives that had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away. 7And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle’s daughter; for she had neither father nor mother, and the maiden was of beautiful form and fair to look on; and when her father and mother were dead, Mordecai took her for his own daughter.
<br>8So it came to pass, when the king’s commandment and his decree was
<br>
<br>a Heb. Hege.
<br> 
<br>published, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the castle, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was taken into the king’s house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women. 9And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her ointments, with her portions, and the seven maidens, who were meet to be given her out of the king’s house; and he advanced her and her maidens to the best place in the house of the women. 10Esther had not made known her people nor her kindred; for Mordecai had charged her that she should not tell it. 11And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women’s house, to know how Esther did, and what would become of her.
<br>12Now when the turn of every maiden was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that it had been done to her according to the law for the women, twelve months—for so were the days of their anointing accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of myrrh, and six month with sweet odours, and with other ointments of the women —13when then the maiden came unto the king, whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king’s house. 14In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king’s chamberlain, who kept the concubines; she came in unto the king no more,
<br> 
<br>except the king delighted in her, and she were called by name.
<br>15Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king’s chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her. 16So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign. 17And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti. 18Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, even Esther’s feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the bounty of the king.
<br>19And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, and Mordecai sat in the king’s gate— 20Esther had not yet made known her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her; for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him— 21in those days, while Mordecai sat in the king’s gate, two of the king’s chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those that kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hands on the king
<br> 
<br>Ahasuerus. 22And the thing became known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the queen; and Esther told the king thereof in Mordecai’s name. 23And when inquisition was made of the matter, and it was found to be so, they were both hanged on a tree; and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.
<br>
<br>After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the
<br>son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him. 2And all the king’s servants, that were in the king’s gate, bowed down, and prostrated themselves before Haman; for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not down, nor prostrated himself before him. 3Then the king’s servants, that were in the king’s gate, said unto Mordecai: ‘Why transgressest thou the king’s commandment?’ 4Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai’s words would stand; for he had told them that he was a Jew. 5And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not down, nor prostrated himself before him, then was Haman full of wrath. 6But it seemed contemptible in his eyes to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had made known to him the people of Mordecai; wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the
<br> 
<br>whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai. 7In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.
<br>8And		Haman		said	unto	king Ahasuerus: ‘There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from those of every people; neither keep they the king’s laws; therefore it profiteth not the king to suffer them. 9If it please the king, let it be written that they be destroyed; and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those that have the charge of the king’s business, to bring it into the king’s treasuries.’ 10And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews’enemy. 11And the king said unto Haman: ‘The silver is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.’ 12Then were the king’s   scribes called in the first month, on the thirteenth day thereof, and there was written, according to all that Haman commanded, unto the king’s satraps, and to  the  governors  that were  over every province, and to the princes of every	people;	to	every	province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it
<br> 
<br>written, and it was sealed with the king’s ring. 13And letters were sent by posts into all the king’s provinces, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey. 14The copy of the writing, to be given out for a decree in every province, was to be published unto all peoples, that they should be ready against that day. 15The posts went forth in haste by the king’s commandment, and the decree was given out in Shushan the castle; and the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city of Shushan was perplexed.
<br>Now when Mordecai knew all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry; 2and he came even before the king’s gate; for none might enter within the king’s gate clothed with sackcloth. 3And in every province, whithersoever	the	king’s commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and
<br>ashes.
<br>4And Esther’s maidens and her chamberlains came and told it her; and the queen was exceedingly pained; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai; and to take his sackcloth from off him;
<br> 
<br>but he accepted it not. 5Then called Esther for Hathach, one of the king’s chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and charged him to go to Mordecai, to know what this was, and why it was. 6So Hathach went forth to Mordecai unto the broad place of the city, which was before the king’s gate. 7And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and the exact sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king’s treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them. 8Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given out in Shushan to destroy them, to show it unto Esther, and to declare it unto her; and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him, for her people.
<br>9And Hathach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai. 10Then Esther spoke unto Hathach, and gave him a message unto Mordecai: 11’All the king’s servants, and the people of the king’s provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law for him, that he be put to death, except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live; but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days.’ 12And they told to Mordecai Esther’s words.
<br> 
<br>13Then Mordecai bade them to return answer unto Esther: ‘Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king’s house, more than all the Jews. 14For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then will relief and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place, but thou and thy father’s house will perish; and who knoweth whether thou art not come to royal estate for such a time as this?’ 15Then Esther bade them return answer unto Mordecai: 16’Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day; I also and my maidens will fast in like manner; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law; and if I perish, I perish.’ 17So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.
<br>Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king’s house, over against the king’s house; and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the entrance of the house. 2And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favour in his sight; and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre. 3Then said the king unto her: ‘What wilt thou, queen Esther? for whatever thy request, even to the half
<br> 
<br>of the kingdom, it shall be given thee.’ 4And Esther said: ‘If it seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him.’ 5Then the king said: ‘Cause Haman to make haste, that it may be done as Esther hath said.’ So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared. 6And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine: ‘Whatever thy petition, it shall be granted thee; and whatever thy request, even to the half of the kingdom, it shall be performed.’ 7Then answered Esther, and said: ‘My petition and my request is— 8if I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request— let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to-morrow as the king hath said.’
<br>9Then went Haman forth that day joyful and glad of heart; but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king’s gate, that he stood not up, nor moved for him, Haman was filled with wrath against Mordecai. 10Nevertheless Haman refrained himself, and went home; and he sent and fetched his friends and Zeresh his wife. 11And Haman recounted unto them the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and everything as to how the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king. 12Haman said moreover: ‘Yea, Esther the queen did
<br> 
<br>let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to-morrow also am I invited by her together with the king. 13Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.’ 14Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him: ‘Let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and in the morning speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon; then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet.’ And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made.
<br>On that night could not the king sleep; and he commanded to bring
<br>the book of records of the chronicles, and they were read before the king. 2And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s chamberlains, of those that kept the door, who had sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus. 3And the king said: ‘What honour and dignity hath been done to Mordecai for this?’ Then said the king’s servants that ministered unto him: ‘There is nothing done for him.’ 4And the king said: ‘Who is in the court?’—Now Haman was come into the outer court of the king’s house, to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.— 5And the king’s servants said unto him: ‘Behold, Haman standeth in the court.’ And the king said: ‘Let him come in.’ 6So
<br> 
<br>Haman came in. And the king said unto him: ‘What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour?’—Now Haman said in his heart: ‘Whom would the king delight to honour besides myself?’—7And Haman said unto the king: ‘For the man whom the king delighteth to honour, 8let royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and on whose head a crown royal is set; 9and let the apparel and the horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king’s most noble princes, that they may array the man therewith whom the king delighteth to honour, and cause him to ride on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him: Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honour.’ 10Then the king said to Haman: ‘Make haste, and take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth at the king’s gate; let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken.’ 11Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and caused him to ride through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him: ‘Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour.’
<br>12And Mordecai returned to the king’s gate. But Haman hasted to his house, mourning and having his head covered. 13And Haman recounted unto Zeresh his wife and all his friends
<br> 
<br>every thing that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him: ‘If Mordecai, before whom thou hast begun to fall, be of the seed of the Jews, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him.’ 14While they were yet talking with him, came the king’s chamberlains, and hastened to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared.
<br>So the king and Haman came to banquet with   Esther   the queen. 2And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine: ‘Whatever thy petition, queen Esther, it shall be granted thee; and whatever thy request, even to the half of the kingdom, it shall be performed.’ 3Then Esther the queen answered and said: ‘If I have found favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request; 4for we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my peace, for the adversary is not worthy that the
<br>king be endamaged.’
<br>5Then spoke the king Ahasuerus and said unto Esther the queen: ‘Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so?’ 6And Esther said: ‘An adversary and an enemy, even this wicked Haman.’ Then Haman was terrified before the king and the queen. 7And the king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine
<br> 
<br>and went into the palace garden; but Haman remained to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king. 8Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the couch whereon Esther was. Then said the king: ‘Will he even force the queen before me in the house?’ As the word went out of the king’s mouth, they covered Haman’s face. 9Then said Harbonah, one of the chamberlains that were before the king: ‘Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman hath made for Mordecai, who spoke good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman.’ And the king said: ‘Hang him thereon.’ 10So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king’s wrath assuaged.
<br>On	that	day	did	the	king Ahasuerus give   the   house   of Haman the Jews’enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was unto her. 2And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai.
<br>And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.
<br>3And Esther spoke yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised
<br> 
<br>against the Jews. 4Then the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre. So Esther arose, and stood before the king. 5And she said: ‘If it please the king, and if I have found favour in his sight, and the thing seem right before the king, and I be pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews that are in all the king’s provinces; 6for how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?’
<br>7Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew: ‘Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews. 8Write ye also concerning the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king’s name, and seal it with the king’s ring; for the writing which is written in the king’s name, and sealed with the king’s ring, may no man reverse.’ 9Then were the king’s scribes called at that time, in the third month, which is the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth day thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded concerning the Jews, even to the satraps, and the governors and princes of the provinces which are from India unto Ethiopia, a hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every province according to the writing thereof, and unto every people after their language, and to the Jews
<br> 
<br>according to their writing, and according to their language. 10And they wrote in the name of king Ahasuerus, and sealed it with the king’s ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, riding on swift steeds that were used in the king’s service, bred of the stud; 11that the king had granted the Jews that were in every city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, and to slay, and to cause to perish, all the forces of the people and province that would assault them, their little ones and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey, 12upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, namely, upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar. 13The copy of the writing, to be given out for a decree in every province, was to be published unto all the peoples, and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies. 14So the posts that rode upon swift steeds that were used in the king’s service went out, being hastened and pressed on by the king’s commandment; and the decree was given out in Shushan the castle.
<br>15And Mordecai went forth from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a rob of fine linen and purple; and the city of Shushan shouted and was glad. 16The Jews had light and gladness, and joy and honour. 17And in every province, and
<br> 
<br>in every city, whithersoever the king’s commandment and his decree came, the Jews had gladness and joy, a feast and a good day. And many from among the peoples of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews was fallen upon them.
<br>Now in the twelfth month, which is	the	month	Adar,	on	the thirteenth day of the same, when the king’s commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have rule over them; whereas it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them; 2the Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt; and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them was fallen upon all the peoples. 3And all the princes of the provinces, and the satraps, and the governors, and they that did the king’s business, helped the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai was fallen upon them. 4For Mordecai was great in the king’s house, and his fame went forth throughout all the provinces; for the man Mordecai waxed greater and greater. 5And the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and with slaughter and destruction, and did what they would unto them that hated them. 6And in Shushan the castle the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men. 7And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha, 8and Poratha,
<br> 
<br>and Adalia, and Aridatha, 9and Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vaizatha, 10the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Jews’enemy, slew they; but on the spoil they laid not their hand.
<br>11On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the castle was brought before the king. 12And the king said unto Esther the queen: ‘The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the castle, and the ten sons of Haman; what then have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces! Now whatever thy petition, it shall be granted thee; and whatever thy request further, it shall be done.’ 13Then said Esther: ‘If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews that are in Shushan to do to-morrow also according unto this day’s decree, and let Haman’s ten sons be hanged upon the gallows.’ 14And the king commanded it so to be done; and a decree was given out in Shushan; and they hanged Haman’s ten sons. 15And the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men in Shushan; but on the spoil they laid not their hand.
<br>16And the other Jews that were in the king’s provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and slew of them that hated them seventy and five thousand—but on the spoil they laid not their hand—
<br> 
<br>17on the thirteenth day of the month Adar, and on the fourteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness. 18But the Jews that	were	in	Shushan		assembled together on the thirteenth day thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness. 19Therefore do the Jews of the villages, that dwell in the unwalled towns, make the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another. 20And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the Jews that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both nigh and far, 21to enjoin them that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly, 22the days wherein the Jews had rest from their enemies, and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow	to		gladness,	and	from mourning into a good day; that they should make them days of feasting and gladness, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor. 23And the Jews took upon them to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written unto them; 24because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast pur, that is, the lot, to discomfit them, and to destroy them;
<br> 
<br>25but when ashe came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he had devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head; and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows. 26Wherefore they called these days Purim, after the name of pur. Therefore because of all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and that which had come unto them, 27the Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to the writing thereof, and according to the appointed time thereof, every year; 28and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish from their seed.
<br>29Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote down all the acts of power, to confirm this second letter of Purim. 30And he sent letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth, 31to confirm these days of Purim in their appointed times, according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the
<br>
<br>a That is, Esther.
<br> 
<br>queen had enjoined them, and as they had ordained for themselves and for their seed, the matters of the fastings and their cry. 32And the commandment of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.
<br>
<br>And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute   upon   the   land,   and
<br>upon the isles of the sea. 2And all the acts of his power and of his might, and
<br> 
<br>the full account of the greatness of Mordecai, how the king advanced him, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia? 3For Mordecai the Jew was next unto king Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of his brethren; seeking the good of his people and speaking peace to all his seed.
<br> 
<br>דניאל
<br>DANIEL
<br> 
<br>IN THE third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it. 2And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God; and he carried them into the land of Shinar to the house of his god, and the vessels he brought into the treasure-house of his god.		3And		the		king	spoke	unto Ashpenaz his chief officer, that he should bring in certain of the children of Israel, and of the seed royal, and of the nobles, 4youths in whom was no blemish, but fair to look on, and skilful in	all	wisdom,		and		skilful		in knowledge, and discerning in thought, and such as had ability to stand in the king’s palace; and that he should teach them the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans. 5And the king appointed for them a daily portion of the king’s food, and of the wine which he drank, and that they should be nourished three years; that at the end thereof they might stand before the king. 6Now among these were, of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. 7And the chief of the officers gave names unto them: unto Daniel he gave the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah,	of	Shadrach;		and		to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah,
<br>of Abed-nego.
<br> 
<br>8But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the king’s food, nor with the wine which he drank; therefore he requested of the chief of the officers that he might not defile himself. 9And God granted Daniel mercy and compassion in the sight of the chief of the officers. 10And the chief of the officers said unto Daniel: ‘I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your food and your drink; for why should he see your faces sad in comparison with the youths that are of your own age? so would ye endanger my head with the king.’ 11Then said Daniel to the steward, whom the chief of the officers had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael,	and   Azariah:	12’Try thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink. 13Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the youths that eat of the king’s food; and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.’ 14So he hearkened unto them in this matter, and tried them ten days. 15And at the end of ten days	their	countenances		appeared fairer, and they were fatter in flesh, than all the youths that did eat of the king’s food. 16So the steward took away their food, and the wine that they should drink, and gave them pulse. 17Now as for these four youths, God
<br> 
<br>gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom; and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams. 18And at the end of the days which the king had appointed for bringing them in, the chief of the officers brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar. 19And the king spoke with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; therefore stood they before the king. 20And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters that were in all his realm. 21And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus.
<br>And in the second year of the reign	of	Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams; and his spirit was troubled, and his sleep broke from him. 2Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the enchanters, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, to tell the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king. 3And the king said unto them: ‘I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream.’ 4Then spoke the Chaldeans to the king in Aramaic: ‘O king, live for ever! tell thy servants the dream, and we will declare the interpretation.’ 5The king answered and said to the Chaldeans: ‘The thing is certain with me; if ye make not known unto me the dream and the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall
<br> 
<br>be made a dunghill. 6But if ye declare the dream and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour; only declare unto me the dream and the interpretation thereof.’ 7They answered the second time and said: ‘Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will declare the interpretation.’ 8The king answered and said: ‘I know of a truth that ye would gain time, inasmuch as ye see the thing is certain with me, 9that, if ye make not known unto me the dream, there is but one law for you; and ye have agreed together to speak before me lying and corrupt words, till the time be changed; only tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can declare unto me the interpretation thereof.’ 10The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said: ‘There is not a man upon the earth that can declare the king’s matter; forasmuch as no great and powerful king hath asked such a thing of any magician, or enchanter, or Chaldean. 11And it is a hard thing that the king asketh, and there is none other that can declare it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.’ 12For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon. 13So the decree went forth, and the wise men were to be slain; and they sought Daniel and his companions to be slain.
<br>14Then Daniel returned answer with counsel and discretion to Arioch the
<br> 
<br>captain of the king’s guard, who was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon; 15he answered and said to Arioch the king’s captain: ‘Wherefore is the decree so peremptory from the king?’ Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel. 16Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, that he might declare unto the king the interpretation.
<br>17Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions; 18that they might ask mercy of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his companions should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. 19Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a vision of the night. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven. 20Daniel spoke and said:
<br>Blessed be the name of God From everlasting even unto
<br>everlasting;
<br>For wisdom and might are His;
<br>21And He changeth the times and the seasons;
<br>He removeth kings, and setteth up kings;
<br>He giveth wisdom unto the wise,
<br>And knowledge to them that know understanding;
<br>22He revealeth the deep and secret things;
<br>He knoweth what is in the darkness, And the light dwelleth with Him.
<br>23I thank Thee, and praise Thee,
<br> 
<br>O Thou God of my fathers, w Who hast given me wisdom and
<br>might,
<br>And hast now made known unto me what we desired of Thee;
<br>For Thou hast made known unto us the king’s matter.
<br>24Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and said thus unto him: ‘Destroy not the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will declare unto the king the interpretation.’
<br>25Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him: ‘I have found a man of the children of the captivity of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.’ 26The king spoke and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar: ‘Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?’ 27Daniel answered before the king, and said: ‘The secret which the king hath asked can neither wise men, enchanters, magicians, nor astrologers, declare unto the king; 28but there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and He hath made known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the end of days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these: 29as for thee, O king, thy thoughts came [into thy mind] upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter; and He that revealeth secrets hath made known to thee what shall
<br> 
<br>come to pass. 30But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but to the intent that the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that thou mayest know the thoughts of thy heart.
<br>31Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This image, which was mighty, and whose brightness was surpassing, stood before thee; and the appearance thereof was terrible. 32As for that image, its head was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of brass, 33its legs of iron, its feet part of iron and part of clay. 34Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon its feet that were of iron and clay, and broke them to pieces. 35Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken in pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors; and the wind carried them away, so that no place was found for them; and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth. 36This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.
<br>37Thou, O king, king of kings, unto whom the God of heaven hath given the kingdom, the power, and the strength, and the glory; 38and wheresoever the children of men, the beasts of the field, and the fowls of the heaven dwell, hath He given them into thy hand, and hath made thee to rule
<br> 
<br>over them all; thou art the head of gold. 39And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee; and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth. 40And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron; forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and beateth down all things; and as iron that crusheth all these, shall it break in pieces and crush. 41And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters’clay, and part of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom; but there shall be in it of the firmness of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay. 42And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so part of the kingdom shall be strong, and part thereof broken. 43And whereas thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves by the seed of men; but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron doth not mingle with clay. 44And in the days of those kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed; nor shall the kingdom be left to another people; it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, but it shall stand for ever. 45Forasmuch as thou sawest that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter; and the dream is certain, and the interpretation
<br> 
<br>thereof sure.’ 46Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an offering and sweet odours unto him. 47The king spoke unto Daniel, and said: ‘Of a truth it is, that your God is the God of gods, and the Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou hast been able to reveal this secret.’ 48Then the king made Daniel great, and gave him many great gifts, and made him to rule over the whole province of Babylon, and to be chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon. 49And Daniel requested of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon; but Daniel was in the gate of the king.
<br>
<br>Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height
<br>was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits; he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon. 2Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. 3Then the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the   dedication   of   the   image   that
<br> 
<br>Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up. 4And the herald cried aloud: ‘To you it is commanded, O peoples, nations, and languages, 5that at what time ye hear the sound of the horn, pipe, harp, trigon, psaltery, bagpipe, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up; 6and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.’ 7Therefore at that time, when all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, pipe, harp, trigon, psaltery, and all kinds of music, all the peoples, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
<br>8Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and brought accusation against the Jews. 9They spoke and said to Nebuchadnezzar the king: ‘O king, live for ever! 10Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the horn, pipe, harp, trigon, psaltery, and bagpipe, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image; 11and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. 12There are certain Jews whom thou hast appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they
<br> 
<br>serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.’
<br>13Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. Then were these men brought before the king. 14Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said unto them: ‘Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, that ye serve not my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up? 15Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the horn, pipe, harp, trigon, psaltery, and bagpipe, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made
<br>, well; but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is the god that shall deliver you out of my hands?’ 16Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, answered and said to the king: ‘O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer thee in this matter. 17If our God whom we serve is able to deliver us, He will deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and out of thy hand, O king. 18But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.’
<br>19Then was Nebuchadnezzar filled with fury, and the form of his visage was changed, against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; he spoke, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was wont to be heated. 20And he commanded certain  mighty men that
<br> 
<br>were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace. 21Then these men were bound in their cloaks, their tunics, and their robes, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace. 22Therefore because the king’s commandment was peremptory, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. 23And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
<br>24Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was alarmed, and rose up in haste; he spoke and said unto his ministers: ‘Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire?’ They answered and said unto the king: ‘True, O king.’ 25He answered and said: ‘Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods.’
<br>26Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace; he spoke and said: ‘Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, ye servants of God Most High, come forth, and come hither.’ Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, came forth out of the midst of the fire. 27And the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, and the king’s ministers, being gathered together, saw these men, that the fire had no power upon
<br> 
<br>their bodies, nor was the hair of their head singed, neither were their cloaks changed, nor had the smell of fire passed on them. 28Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said: ‘Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent His angel, and delivered His servants that trusted in Him, and have changed the king’s word, and have yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God. 29Therefore I make a decree, that every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill; because there is no other god that is able to deliver after this sort.’ 30Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, in the province of Babylon.
<br>
<br>31‘Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all peoples, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; peace be multiplied unto you. 32It hath seemed good unto me to declare the signs and wonders that God Most High hath wrought toward me.
<br>33How great are His signs!
<br>And how mighty are His wonders!
<br>His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom,
<br>And His dominion is from generation to generation.
<br>I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my
<br> 
<br>palace.   2I saw a dream which made me afraid; and imaginings upon my bed and the visions of my head affrighted me. 3Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream. 4Then came in the magicians, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the astrologers; and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof. 5But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and I told the dream before him: 6O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret causeth thee trouble, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof. 7Thus were the visions of my head upon my bed: I saw,
<br>And behold a tree in the midst of the earth,
<br>And the height thereof was great.
<br>8The tree grew, and was strong,
<br>And the height thereof reached unto heaven,
<br>And the sight thereof to the end of all the earth.
<br>9The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much,
<br>And in it was food for all;
<br>The beasts of the field had shadow under it,
<br> 
<br>And the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the branches thereof,
<br>And all flesh was fed of it.
<br>10I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and a holy one came down from heaven. 11He cried aloud, and said thus:
<br>Hew down the tree, and cut off its branches,
<br>Shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit;
<br>Let the beasts get away from under it,
<br>And the fowls from its branches.
<br>12Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth,
<br>Even in a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field;
<br>And let it be wet with the dew of heaven,
<br>And let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth;
<br>13Let his heart be changed from man’s,
<br>And let a beast’s heart be given unto him;
<br>And let seven times pass over him.
<br>14The matter is by the decree of the watchers,
<br>And the sentence by the word of the holy ones;
<br>To the intent that the living may know
<br>That the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men,
<br>And giveth it to whomsoever He will,
<br>And setteth up over it the lowest of men.
<br> 
<br>15This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen; and thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation, forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation; but thou art able, for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee.’
<br>
<br>16Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was appalled for a while, and his thoughts affrighted him. The king spoke and said: ‘Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation, affright thee.’ Belteshazzar answered and said: ‘My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine adversaries. 17The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth; 18whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was food for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation; 19it is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong; for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth. 20And whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from heaven, and saying: Hew down the tree, and destroy it; nevertheless leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even in a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the
<br> 
<br>beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him—21this is the interpretation, O king, and it is the decree of the Most High, which is come upon my lord the king, 22that thou shalt be driven from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and thou shalt be made to eat grass as oxen, and shalt be wet with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee; till thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever He will. 23And whereas it was commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the tree, thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule. 24Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by almsgiving, and thine iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; if there may be a lengthening of thy prosperity.’
<br>25All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar. 26At the end of twelve months he was walking upon the royal palace of Babylon. 27The king spoke, and said: ‘Is not this great Babylon, which I have built for a royal dwelling-place, by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?’ 28While the word was in the king’s mouth, there fell a voice from heaven: ‘O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken: the kingdom is departed from thee. 29And thou shalt be driven from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field; thou shalt be made to eat grass as
<br> 
<br>oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee; until thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever He will.’ 30The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar; and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hair was grown like eagles’feathers, and his nails like birds’claws.
<br>
<br>31‘And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and honoured Him that liveth for ever;
<br>For His dominion is an everlasting dominion,
<br>And His kingdom from generation to generation;
<br>32And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing;
<br>And He doeth according to His will in the host of heaven,
<br>And among the inhabitants of the earth;
<br>And none can stay His hand,
<br>Or say unto Him: What doest Thou? 33At the same time mine understanding returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my majesty and my splendour returned unto me; and my ministers and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and surpassing greatness was added unto me. 34Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and
<br> 
<br>honour the King of heaven; for all His works are truth, and His ways justice; and those that walk in pride He is able to abase.’
<br>
<br>Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand. 2Belshazzar, while he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden		and	silver	vessels	which Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king and his lords, his consorts and his concubines, might drink therein. 3Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king, and his lords, his consorts and his concubines, drank in them. 4They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone. 5In the same hour came forth fingers of a man’s hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaster of the wall of the king’s palace; and the king saw the palm of the hand that	wrote.		6Then		the	king’s countenance was changed in him, and his thoughts affrighted him; and the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another. 7The king cried aloud to bring in the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the astrologers. The king spoke and said to the wise men of Babylon: ‘Whosoever shall read this writing, and declare unto me the interpretation thereof,
<br> 
<br>shall be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall rule as one of three in the kingdom.’
<br>8Then came in all the king’s wise men: but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation. 9Then was king Belshazzar greatly affrighted, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were perplexed. 10Now the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords came into the banquet house; the queen spoke and said: ‘O king, live for ever! let not thy thoughts affright thee, nor let thy countenance be changed; 11there is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; and the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, I say, thy father, made him master of the magicians, enchanters, Chaldeans, and astrologers; 12forasmuch as a surpassing spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and declaring of riddles, and loosing of knots, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be called, and he will declare the interpretation.’
<br>13Then was Daniel brought in before the king. The king spoke and said unto Daniel: ‘Art thou Daniel, who is of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Judah? 14I have heard of thee, that
<br> 
<br>the spirit of the gods is in thee, and that light and understanding and surpassing wisdom is found in thee. 15And now the wise men, the enchanters, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known unto me the interpretation thereof; but they could not declare the interpretation of the thing. 16But I have heard of thee, that thou canst give interpretations, and loose knots; now if thou canst read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt rule as one of three in the kingdom.’
<br>17Then Daniel answered and said before the king: ‘Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; nevertheless I will read the writing unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation. 18O thou king, God Most High gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father the kingdom, and greatness, and glory, and majesty; 19and because of the greatness that He gave him, all the peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew, and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he raised up, and whom he would he put down. 20But when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit was hardened that he dealt proudly, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and his glory was taken from him; 21and he was driven from the sons of men, and his heart was
<br> 
<br>made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses; he was fed with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; until he knew that God Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and that He setteth up over it whomsoever He will. 22And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thy heart, though thou knewest all this; 23but hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of His house before thee, and thou and thy lords, thy consorts and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know; and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified; 24then was the palm of the hand sent from before Him, and this writing was inscribed. 25And this is the writing that was inscribed: MENE MENE, TEKEL UPHARSIN.
<br>26This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE, God hath numbered thy kingdom, and brought it to an end. 27TEKEL, Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting. 28PERES, thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.’ 29Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with purple, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made proclamation concerning him, that he should rule as one of three in the kingdom. 30In that night Belshazzar the Chaldean king was slain.
<br> 
<br>And Darius the Mede received the kingdom, being about threescore
<br> 
<br>according to the law of the Medes and Persians,	which	altereth	not.’
<br> 
<br>and two years old. 2It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom a hundred and twenty satraps, who should be throughout the whole kingdom; 3and over them three presidents, of whom Daniel was one; that these satraps might give account unto them, and that the king should have no damage. 4Then this Daniel distinguished himself above the presidents and the satraps, because a surpassing spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.
<br>5Then the presidents and the satraps sought to find occasion against Daniel as touching the kingdom; but they could find no occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him. 6Then said these men: ‘We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him in the matter of the law of his God.’ 7Then these presidents and satraps came tumultuously to the king, and said thus unto him: ‘King Darius, live for ever! 8All the presidents of the kingdom, the prefects and the satraps, the ministers and the governors, have consulted together that the king should establish a statute, and make a strong interdict, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions. 9Now, O king, establish the interdict, and sign the writing, that it be not changed,
<br> 
<br>10Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the interdict.
<br>11And when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house—now his windows were open in his upper chamber toward Jerusalem—and he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime. 12Then these men came tumultuously, and found Daniel making petition and supplication before his God. 13Then they came near, and spoke before the king concerning the king’s interdict: ‘Hast thou not signed an interdict, that every man that shall make petition unto any god or man within thirty days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions?’ The king answered and said: ‘The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.’ 14Then answered they and said before the king: ‘That Daniel, who is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the interdict that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day.’ 15Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him; and he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him. 16Then these men came tumultuously unto the king, and said unto the king: ‘Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians, that no interdict nor statute
<br> 
<br>which the king establisheth may be changed.’ 17Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. Now the king spoke and said unto Daniel: ‘Thy God whom thou servest continually, He will deliver thee.’ 18And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel.
<br>19Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting; neither were diversions brought before him; and his sleep fled from him.   20Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions. 21And when he came near unto the den to Daniel, he cried with a pained voice; the king spoke and said to Daniel: ‘O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?’ 22Then said Daniel unto the king: ‘O king, live for ever! 23My God hath sent His angel, and hath shut the lions’mouths, and they have not hurt me; forasmuch as before Him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt.’ 24Then was the king exceeding glad, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he had trusted in his God. 25And the king commanded,
<br> 
<br>and they brought those men that had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and they had not come to the bottom of the den, when the lions had the mastery of them, and broke all their bones in pieces.
<br>26Then king Darius wrote unto all the peoples, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth: ‘Peace be multiplied unto you. 27I make a decree, that in all the dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel;
<br>For He is the living God, And stedfast for ever,
<br>And His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed,
<br>And His dominion shall be even unto the end;
<br>28He delivereth and rescueth,
<br>And He worketh signs and wonders In heaven and in earth;
<br>Who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.’
<br>29So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
<br>
<br>In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had   a dream and visions of his head upon his bed; then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters. 2Daniel spoke and said: I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven broke forth upon the great sea. 3And four great beasts came up from
<br> 
<br>the sea, diverse one from another. 4The first was like a lion, and had eagle’s wings; I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked off, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon two feet as a man, and a man’s heart was given to it. 5And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth; and it was said thus unto it: ‘Arise, devour much flesh.’ 6After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the sides of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it. 7After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet; and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns. 8I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots; and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things. 9I beheld
<br>Till thrones were placed,
<br>And one that was ancient of days did sit:
<br>His raiment was as white snow,
<br>And the hair of his head like pure wool;
<br>His throne was fiery flames, and the wheels thereof burning fire.
<br> 
<br>10A fiery stream issued
<br>And came forth from before him; thousand thousands ministered unto him,
<br>And ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him;
<br>The judgment was set,
<br>And the books were opened.
<br>11I beheld at that time because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke, I beheld even till the beast was slain, and its body destroyed, and it was given to be burned with fire. 12And as for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away; yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.
<br>13I saw in the night visions,
<br>And, behold, there came with the clouds of heaven
<br>One like unto a son of man,
<br>And he came even to the Ancient of days,
<br>And he was brought near before Him.
<br>14And there was given him dominion,
<br>And glory, and a kingdom,
<br>That all the peoples, nations, and languages
<br>Should serve him;
<br>His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away,
<br>And his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.
<br>15As for me Daniel, my spirit was pained in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head affrighted me.
<br> 
<br>16I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things: 17’These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, that shall arise out of the earth. 18But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.’ 19Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth beast, which was diverse from all of them, exceeding terrible, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet; 20and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other horn which came up, and before which three fell; even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke great things, whose appearance was greater than that of its fellows. 21I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them; 22until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given for the saints of the Most High; and the time came, and the saints possessed the kingdom. 23Thus he said: ‘The fourth beast shall be a fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces. 24And as for the ten horns, out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise; and another shall arise after them; and he shall be diverse from the former, and he shall put down three kings.
<br> 
<br>25And he shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High; and he shall think to change the seasons and the law; and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time. 26But the judgment shall sit, and his dominions shall be taken away, to be consumed and to be destroy unto the end. 27And the kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High; their kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey them.’ 28Here is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my thoughts much affrighted me, and my countenance was changed in me; but I kept the matter in my heart.
<br>In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first. 2And I saw in the vision; now it was so, that when I saw, I was in Shushan the castle, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in the vision, and I was by the stream Ulai. 3And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the stream a ram which had two horns; and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last. 4I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; and no beasts could stand before him, neither was there any that
<br> 
<br>could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and magnified himself.
<br>5And as I was considering, behold, a he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground; and the goat had a conspicuous horn between his eyes. 6And he came to the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing before the stream, and ran at him in the fury of his power. 7And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and broke his two horns; and there was no power in the ram to stand before him; but he cast him down to the ground, and trampled upon him; and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand. 8And the he-goat magnified himself exceedingly; and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and instead of it there came up the appearance of four horns toward the four winds of heaven.
<br>9And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the beauteous land. 10And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and some of the host and of the stars it cast down to the ground, and trampled upon them. 11Yea, it magnified itself, even to the prince of the host; and from him the continual burnt-offering was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down. 12And the host was given over to it
<br> 
<br>together with the continual burnt- offering through transgression; and it cast down truth to the ground, and it wrought, and prospered. 13Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said unto that certain one who spoke: ‘How long shall be the vision concerning the continual burnt- offering, and the transgression that causes appalment, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trampled under foot?’ 14And he said unto me: ‘Unto two thousand and three hundred evenings and mornings; then shall the sanctuary be victorious.’
<br>15And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, that I sought to understand it; and, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man. 16And I heard the voice of a man between the banks of Ulai, who called, and said: ‘Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.’ 17So he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was terrified, and fell upon my face; but he said unto me: ‘Understand, O son of man; for the vision belongeth to the time of the end.’ 18Now as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face toward the ground; but he touched me, and set me upright. 19And he said: ‘Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the latter time of the indignation; for it belongeth to the appointed time of the end. 20The ram which thou sawest having the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia. 21And the
<br> 
<br>rough he-goat is the king of Greece; and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king. 22And as for that which was broken, in the place whereof four stood up, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not with his power. 23And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors have completed their transgression, there shall stand up a king of fierce countenance, and understanding stratagems. 24And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power; and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper and do; and he shall destroy them that are mighty and the people of the saints. 25And through his cunning he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and in time of security shall he destroy many; he shall also stand up against the prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand. 26And the vision of the evenings and mornings which hath been told is true; but thou, shut thou up the vision; for it belongeth to many days to come.’ 27And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; then I rose up, and did the king’s business; and I was appalled at the vision, but understood it not.
<br>
<br>In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans; 2in the first year of his reign I Daniel meditated in the books, over the number of the
<br> 
<br>years, whereof the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, that He would accomplish for the desolations of Jerusalem seventy years. 3And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes. 4And I prayed unto the LORD my God, and made confession, and said: ‘O Lord, the great and awful God, who keepest covenant and mercy with them that love Thee and keep Thy commandments, 5we have sinned, and have dealt iniquitously, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, and have turned aside from Thy commandments and from Thine ordinances; 6neither have we hearkened unto Thy servants the prophets, that spoke in Thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land. 7Unto Thee, O Lord, belongeth righteousness, but unto us confusion of face, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither Thou hast driven them, because they dealt treacherously with Thee. 8O LORD, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against Thee. 9To the Lord our God belong compassions and forgivenesses; for we have rebelled against Him; 10neither have we hearkened to the voice of the LORD our God, to walk in His laws, which He set before us by His servants the prophets.
<br> 
<br>11Yea, all Israel have transgressed Thy law, and have turned aside, so as not to hearken to Thy voice; and so there hath been poured out upon us the curse and the oath that is written in the Law of Moses the servant of God; for we have sinned against Him. 12And He hath confirmed His word, which He spoke against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil; so that under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem. 13As it is written in the Law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us; yet have we not entreated the favour of the LORD our God, that we might turn from our iniquities, and have discernment in Thy truth. 14And so the LORD hath watched over the evil, and brought it upon us; for the LORD our God is righteous in all His works which He hath done, and we have not hearkened to His voice. 15And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought Thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten Thee renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly. 16O Lord, according to all Thy righteousness, let Thine anger and Thy fury, I pray Thee, be turned away from Thy city Jerusalem, Thy holy mountain; because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and Thy people are become a reproach to all that are about us. 17Now therefore, O our God, hearken unto the prayer of Thy servant, and to his supplications,
<br> 
<br>and cause Thy face to shine upon Thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord’s sake. 18O my God, incline Thine ear, and hear; open Thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city upon which Thy name is called; for we do not present our supplications before Thee because of our righteousness, but because of Thy great compassions. 19O Lord, hear, O Lord, forgive, O Lord, attend and do, defer not; for Thine own sake, O my God, because Thy name is called upon Thy city and Thy people.’
<br>20And while I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the LORD my God for the holy mountain of my God; 21yea, while I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, approached close to me about the time of the evening offering. 22And he made me to understand, and talked with me, and said: ‘O Daniel, I am now come forth to make thee skilful of understanding. 23At the beginning of thy supplications a word went forth, and I am come to declare it; for thou art greatly beloved; therefore look into the word, and understand the vision. 24Seventy weeks are decreed upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sin, and to forgive iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal vision and prophet, and to
<br> 
<br>anoint the most holy place. 25Know therefore and discern, that from the going forth of the word to restore and to build Jerusalem unto one anointed, a prince, shall be seven weeks; and for threescore and two weeks, it shall be built again, with broad place and moat, but in troublous times. 26And after the threescore and two weeks shall an anointed one be cut off, and be no more; and the people of a prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; but his end shall be with a flood; and unto the end of the war desolations are determined. 27And he shall make a firm covenant with many for one week; and for half of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the offering to cease; and upon the wing of detestable things shall be that which causeth appalment; and that until the extermination wholly determined be poured out upon that which causeth appalment.’
<br>In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a word was revealed
<br>unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the word was true, even a great warfare; and he gave heed to the word, and had understanding of the vision. 2In those days I Daniel was mourning three whole weeks. 3I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled. 4And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Tigris, 5I lifted up mine eyes,
<br> 
<br>and looked, and behold a man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz; 6his body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as torches of fire, and his arms and his feet like in colour to burnished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude. 7And I Daniel alone saw the vision; for the men that were with me saw not the vision; howbeit a great trembling fell upon them, and they fled to hide themselves. 8So that I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me; for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength. 9Yet heard I the voice of his words; and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I fallen into a deep sleep on my face, with my face toward the ground. 10And, behold, a hand touched me, which set me tottering upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands. 11And he said unto me: ‘O Daniel, thou man greatly beloved, give heed unto the words that I speak unto thee, and stand upright; for now am I sent unto thee’; and when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling. 12Then said he unto me: ‘Fear not, Daniel; for from the first day that thou didst set thy heart to understand, and to humble thyself before thy God, thy words were heard; and I am come because of thy words. 13But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days; but, lo, Michael,
<br> 
<br>one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I was left over there beside the kings of Persia. 14Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the end of days; for there is yet a vision for the days.’
<br>15And when he had spoken unto me according to these words, I set my face toward the ground, and was dumb. 16And, behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips; then I opened my mouth, and spoke and said unto him that stood before me: ‘O my lord, by reason of the vision my pains are come upon me, and I retain no strength. 17For how can this servant of my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither was there breath left in me.’ 18Then there touched me again one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me. 19And he said: ‘O man greatly beloved, fear not! peace be unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong.’ And when he had spoken unto me, I was strengthened, and said: ‘Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.’ 20Then said he: Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia; and when I go forth, lo, the prince of Greece shall come. 21Howbeit I will declare unto thee that which is inscribed in the writing of truth; and there is none that holdeth with me against these, except Michael your prince.
<br> 
<br>And as for me, in the first year of Darius the Mede, I stood up
<br>to be a supporter and a stronghold unto him.
<br>2And now will I declare unto thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than they all; and when he is waxed strong through his riches, he shall stir up all against the realm of Greece. 3And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will. 4And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; but not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion wherewith he ruled; for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside those.
<br>5And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall be a great dominion.
<br>6And at the end of years they shall join themselves together; and the daughter of the king of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement; but she shall not retain the strength of her arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm; but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begot her, and he that obtained her in those times.
<br>7But one of the shoots of her roots shall stand up in his place, and shall come unto the army, and shall enter
<br> 
<br>into the stronghold of the king of the north, and shall deal with them, and shall prevail; 8and also their gods, with their molten images, and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold, shall he bring into captivity into Egypt; and he shall desist some years from the king of the north. 9And he shall come into the kingdom of the king of the south, but he shall return into his own land.
<br>10And his sons shall stir themselves up, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces, and he shall come on, and overflow, as he passes through; and he shall return and stir himself up, even to his stronghold. 11And the king of the south shall be moved with choler, and shall come forth and fight with him, even with the king of the north; and he shall set forth a great multitude, but the multitude shall be given into his hand. 12and the multitude shall be carried away, and his heart shall be lifted up; and he shall cast down tens of thousands; but he shall not prevail. 13And the king of the north shall again set forth a multitude, greater than the former; and he shall come on at the end of the times, even of years, with a great army and with much substance. 14And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south; also the children of the violent among thy people shall lift themselves up to establish the vision; but they shall stumble. 15And the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mound, and take a well-fortified city; and the arms
<br> 
<br>of the south shall not withstand; and as for his chosen people, there shall be no strength in them to withstand. 16But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him; and he shall stand in the beauteous land, and in his hand shall be extermination. 17And he shall set his face to come with the strength of his whole kingdom, but shall make an agreement with him; and he shall give him the daughter of women, to destroy it; but it shall not stand, neither be for him. 18After this shall he set his face unto the isles, and shall take many; but a captain shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease; yea, he shall cause his own reproach to return upon him. 19Then he shall turn his face toward the strongholds of his own land; but he shall stumble and fall, and shall not be found.
<br>20Then shall stand up in his place one that shall cause an exactor to pass through the glory of the kingdom; but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle.
<br>21And in his place shall stand up a contemptible person, upon whom had not been conferred the majesty of the kingdom; but he shall come in time of security, and shall obtain the kingdom by blandishments. 22And the arms of the flood shall be swept away from before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant. 23And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully; and he shall
<br> 
<br>come up and become strong, with a little nation. 24In time of security shall he come even upon the fattest places of the province; and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers’fathers: he shall scatter among them prey, and spoil, and substance; yea, he shall devise his devices against fortresses, but only until the time.
<br>25And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall stir himself up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand, for they shall devise devices against him. 26Yea, they that eat of his food shall destroy him, and his army shall be swept away; and many shall fall down slain. 27And as for both these kings, their hearts shall be to do mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper, for the end remaineth yet for the time appointed. 28And he shall return to his own land with great substance; and his heart shall be against the holy covenant; and he shall do his pleasure, and return to his own land.
<br>29At the time appointed he shall return, and come into the south; but it shall not be in the latter time as it was in the former. 30For ships of Kittim shall come against him, and he shall be cowed, and he shall return, and have indignation against the holy covenant, and shall do his pleasure; and he shall return, and have regard unto them that
<br> 
<br>forsake the holy covenant. 31And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall profane	the		sanctuary,	even		the stronghold, and shall take away the continual burnt-offering, and they shall set up the detestable thing that causeth appalment. 32And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall be corrupt by blandishments; but the people that know their God shall show strength, and prevail. 33And they that are wise among the people shall cause the many to understand; yet they shall stumble by the sword and by flame, by captivity and by spoil, many days. 34Now when they shall stumble, they shall be helped with a little help; but many shall join themselves unto them with blandishments. 35And some of them that are wise shall stumble, to refine among them, and to purify, and to make white, even to the time of the end; for it is yet for the time appointed. 36And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak strange things against the God of gods; and he shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished; for that which is determined shall be done. 37Neither shall he regard the gods of his fathers; and neither the desire of women, nor any god, shall he regard; for he shall magnify himself above all. 38But in his place shall he honour the god of strongholds; and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with	gold,	and	silver,	and	with precious stones, and costly things.
<br> 
<br>39And he shall deal with the strongest fortresses with the help of a foreign god; whom he shall acknowledge, shall increase glory; and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for a price.
<br>40And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him; and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow, as he passes through. 41He shall enter also into the beauteous land, and many countries shall be overthrown; but these shall be delivered out of his hand, Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon. 42He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries; and the land of Egypt shall not escape. 43But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt; and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps. 44But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall affright him; and he shall go forth with great fury to destroy and utterly to take away many. 45And he shall plant the tents of his palace between the seas and the beauteous holy mountain; and he shall come to his end, and none shall help him.
<br>And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince who standeth for the children of thy people; and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a
<br> 
<br>nation even to that same time; and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book. 2And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to reproaches and everlasting abhorrence. 3And they that are wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn the many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever. 4But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end; many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.’
<br>5Then I Daniel looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the one on the bank of the river on this side, and the other on the bank of the river on that side. 6And one said to the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river: ‘How long shall it be to the end of the wonders?’ 7And I heard the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, when he lifted up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and swore by Him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and a half; and when they have made an end of breaking in pieces the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.
<br>8And I heard, but I understood not; then said I: ‘O my Lord, what shall be the latter end of these things?’ 9And he said: ‘Go thy way, Daniel; for the words are shut up and sealed till the time of the end. 10Many shall purify
<br> 
<br>themselves, and make themselves white, and be refined; but the wicked shall do wickedly; and none of the wicked shall understand; but they that are wise shall understand. 11And from the time that the continual burnt- offering shall be taken away, and the detestable thing that causes appalment
<br> 
<br>set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days. 12Happy is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days. 13But go thou thy way till the end be; and thou shalt rest, and shalt stand up to thy lot, at the end of the days.’
<br> 
<br>עזרא
<br>EZRA
<br> 
<br>NOW IN the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of
<br>the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying: 2’Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia: All the kingdoms of the earth hath the LORD, the God of heaven, given me; and He hath charged me to build Him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. 3Whosoever there is among you of all His people—his God be with him—let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of the LORD, the God of Israel, He is the God who is in Jerusalem. 4And whosoever is left, in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill-offering for the house of God which is in Jerusalem.’
<br>5Then rose up the heads of fathers’houses of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, even all whose spirit God had stirred to go up to build the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem. 6And all they that were round about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things,
<br> 
<br>beside all that was willingly offered. 7Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his gods; 8even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah. 9And this is the number of them: thirty basins of gold, a thousand basins of silver, nine and twenty knives; 10thirty bowls of gold, silver bowls of a second sort four hundred and ten, and other vessels a thousand. 11All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred. All these did Sheshbazzar bring up, when they of the captivity were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem.
<br>Now these are the children of the province, that went up out of the captivity of those that had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away unto Babylon,	and	that	returned	unto Jerusalem and Judah, every one unto his city; 2who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar, Bigvai,

<br>58All the Nethinim, and the children of Solomon’s servants, were three hundred ninety and two.
<br>
<br>59And these were they that went up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsa, Cherub, Addan, and Immer; but they could not tell their fathers’houses, and their seed, whether they were of Israel: 60the children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred fifty and two. 61And of the children of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of Hakkoz, the children of Barzillai, who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called after their name. 62These sought their register, that is, the genealogy, but it was not found; therefore were they deemed polluted and put from the priesthood. 63And the aTirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and with Thummim.
<br>
<br>
<br>a That is, governor.
<br> 
<br>64The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore, 65beside their men-servants and their maid-servants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven; and they had two hundred singing men and singing women. 66Their horses were seven hundred thirty and six; their mules, two hundred forty and five; 67their camels, four hundred thirty and five; their asses, six thousand seven hundred and twenty.
<br>68And some of the heads of fathers’houses, when they came to the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem, offered willingly for the house of God to set it up in its place; 69they gave after their ability into the treasury of the work threescore and one thousand darics of gold, and five thousand pounds of silver, and one hundred priests’tunics.
<br>70So the priests, and the Levites, and some of the people, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinim, dwelt in their cities, and all Israel in their cities.
<br>And when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem. 2Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt-offerings thereon, as it is written in the Law of Moses the man of God.
<br> 
<br>3And they set the altar upon its bases; for fear was upon them because of the people of the countries, and they offered burnt-offerings thereon unto the LORD, even burnt-offerings morning and evening. 4And they kept the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and offered the daily burnt-offerings by number, according to the ordinance, as the duty of every day required; 5and afterward the continual burnt-offering, and the offerings of the new moons, and of all the appointed seasons of the LORD that were hallowed, and of every one that willingly offered a freewill- offering unto the LORD. 6From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt-offerings unto the LORD; but the foundation of the temple of the LORD was not yet laid. 7They gave money also unto the hewers, and to the carpenters; and food, and drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar-trees from Lebanon to the sea, unto Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.
<br>8Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the rest of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to have the oversight of the work of the house of the LORD. 9Then stood Jeshua with
<br> 
<br>his sons and his brethren, and Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to have the oversight of the workmen in the house of God; the sons of Henadad also, with their sons and their brethren the Levites. 10And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the LORD, according to the direction of David king of Israel. 11And they sang one to another in praising and giving thanks unto the LORD: ‘for He is good, for His mercy endureth for ever toward Israel.’ And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid. 12But many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers’houses, the old men that had seen the first house standing on its foundation, wept with a loud voice, when this house was before their eyes; and many shouted aloud for joy; 13so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people; for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.
<br>Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that
<br>the children of the captivity were building a temple unto the LORD, the God of Israel; 2then they drew near to Zerubbabel, and to the heads of fathers’houses, and said unto them: ‘Let us build with you; for we seek
<br> 
<br>your God, as ye do; and we do sacrifice unto Him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assyria, who brought us up hither.’ 3But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of fathers’houses of Israel, said unto them: ‘Ye have nothing to do with us to build a house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto the LORD, the God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us.’ 4Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and harried them while they were building, 5and hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia. 6And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.
<br>7And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of his companions, unto Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in the Aramaic character, and set forth in the Aramaic tongue. 8Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort— 9then wrote Rehum the commander, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions; the Dinites, and the Apharesattechites, the Tarpelites, the Apharesites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Shushanchites, the
<br> 
<br>Dehites, the Elamites, 10and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asenappar brought over, and set in the city of Samaria, and the rest that are in the country beyond the River:— ‘And now—11this is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him, even unto Artaxerxes the king—thy servants the men beyond the River—and now12be it known unto the king, that the Jews that came up from thee are come to us unto Jerusalem; they are building the rebellious and the bad city, and have finished the walls, and are digging out the foundations. 13Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and the walls finished, they will not pay tribute, impost, or toll, and so thou wilt endamage the revenue of the kings. 14Now because we eat the salt of the palace, and it is not meet for us to see the king’s dishonour, therefore have we sent and announced to the king, 15that search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers; so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time; for which cause was this city laid waste. 16We announce to the king that, if this city be builded, and the walls finished, by this means thou shalt have no portion beyond the River.’
<br>17Then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the commander, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of
<br> 
<br>their companions that dwell in Samaria, and unto the rest beyond the River: ‘Peace, and now18the letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me. 19And I decreed, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein. 20There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, who have ruled over all the country beyond the River; and tribute, impost, and toll, was paid unto them. 21Make ye now a decree to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not builded, until a decree shall be made by me. 22And take heed that ye be not slack herein; why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?’
<br>23Then when the copy of king Artaxerxes’letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power. 24Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem; and it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.
<br>Now the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem; in the name of the God of Israel prophesied they	unto	them.	2Then	rose	up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is at
<br> 
<br>Jerusalem; and with them were the prophets of God, helping them. 3At the same time came to them Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai,	and	their companions, and said thus unto them: ‘Who gave you a decree to build this house, and to finish this structure?’ 4’Then spoke we unto them after this manner [, wrote they]: What are the names of the men that build this building?’ 5But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, and they did not make them cease, till the matter should come to Darius, and then answer should be returned by letter concerning it.
<br>6The copy of the letter that Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai, and his companions the Apharesachites, who were beyond the River, sent unto Darius the king; 7they sent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus: ‘Unto Darius the king, all peace. 8Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judah, to the house of the great God, which is builded with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work goeth on with diligence and prospereth in their hands. 9Then asked we those elders, and said unto them thus: Who gave you a decree to build this house, and to finish this wall? 10We asked them their names also, to announce to thee, that we might write the names of the men that were at the head of them. 11And thus they returned us answer, saying:
<br> 
<br>We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was builded these many years ago, which a great king of Israel builded and finished. 12But because that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven, He gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon. 13But in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, Cyrus the king made a decree to build this house of God. 14And the gold and silver vessels also of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto one whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor; 15and he said unto him: Take these vessels, go, put them in the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be builded in its place. 16Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundations of the house of God which is in Jerusalem; and since that time even until now hath it been in building, and yet it is not completed. 17Now therefore, if it seem good to the king, let search be made in the king’s treasure-house there, which is at Babylon, whether it be so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.’
<br> 
<br>Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in
<br>the house of the archives, where the treasures were laid up, in Babylon. 2And there was found at Ahmetha, in the palace that is in the province of Media, a roll, and therein was thus written: ‘A record. 3In the first year of Cyrus the king, Cyrus the king made a decree: Concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, let the house be builded, the place where they offer sacrifices, and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height thereof threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof threescore cubits; 4with three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber, and let the expenses be given out of the king’s house; 5and also let the gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at Jerusalem, and brought unto Babylon, be restored, and brought back unto the temple which is at Jerusalem, every one to its place, and thou shalt put them in the house of God.’
<br>6’Now therefore, Tattenai, governor beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and your companions the Apharesachites, who are beyond the River, be ye far from thence; 7let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in its place. 8Moreover I make a decree concerning what ye shall do to these elders of the Jews for the building of this house of God; that of the king’s
<br> 
<br>goods, even of the tribute beyond the River, expenses be given with all diligence unto these men, that they be not hindered. 9And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for burnt- offerings to the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the word of the priests that are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail; 10that they may offer sacrifices of sweet savour unto the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons. 11Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this word, let a beam be pulled out from his house, and let him be lifted up and fastened thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill for this; 12and may the God that hath caused His name to dwell there overthrow all kings and peoples, that shall put forth their hand to alter the same, to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree; let it be done with all diligence.’
<br>13Then Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and their companions, because that Darius the king had thus sent, acted with all diligence. 14And the elders of the Jews builded and prospered, through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they builded and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the decree of Cyrus, and Darius, and
<br> 
<br>Artaxerxes king of Persia. 15And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.
<br>16And the children of Israel, the priests and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy. 17And they offered at the dedication of this house of God a hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin- offering for all Israel, twelve he-goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel. 18And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, which is at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses.
<br>19And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth day of the first month. 20For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves together; all of them were pure; and they killed the passover lamb for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves. 21And the children of Israel, that were come back out of the captivity, and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the nations of the land, to seek the LORD, the God of Israel, did eat, 22and kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy; for the LORD had made them joyful, and had turned the heart of the king of Assyria unto them, to strengthen their hands in
<br> 
<br>the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.
<br>
<br>Now after these things, in the reign	of	Artaxerxes	king	of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah, 2the son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub, 3the son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth, 4the son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki, 5the son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest— 6this Ezra went up from Babylon; and he was a ready scribe in the Law of Moses, which the LORD, the God of Israel, had given; and the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of the LORD his God upon him. 7And there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinim, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king. 8And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king. 9For upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him. 10For Ezra had set his heart to seek the law of the LORD, and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and
<br>ordinances.
<br>11Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave unto
<br> 
<br>Ezra the priest, the scribe, even the scribe of the words of the commandments of the LORD, and of His statutes to Israel: 12’Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, the scribe of the Law of the God of heaven, and so forth. And now13I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and their priests and the Levites, in my realm, that are minded of their own free will to go with thee to Jerusalem, go. 14Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king and his seven counsellors, to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of thy God which is in thy hand; 15and to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counsellors have freely offered unto the God of Israel, whose habitation is in Jerusalem, 16and all the silver and gold that thou shalt find in all the province of Babylon, with the freewill-offering of the people, and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem; 17therefore thou shalt with all diligence buy with this money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their meal-offerings and their drink-offerings, and shalt offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem. 18And whatsoever shall seem good to thee and to thy brethren to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do ye after the will of your God. 19And the vessels that are given thee for the service of the house of thy God, deliver thou before the God of
<br> 
<br>Jerusalem. 20And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God, which thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of the king’s treasure-house. 21And I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the treasurers that are beyond the River, that whatsoever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the Law of the God of heaven, shall require of you, it be done with all diligence, 22unto a hundred talents of silver, and to a hundred measures of wheat, and to a hundred baths of wine, and to a hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much. 23Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be done exactly for the house of the God of heaven; for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons? 24Also we announce to you, that touching any of the priests and Levites, the singers, porters, Nethinim, or servants of this house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose tribute, impost, or toll, upon them. 25And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God that is in thy hand, appoint magistrates and judges, who may judge all the people that are beyond the River, all such as know the laws of thy God; and teach ye him that knoweth them not. 26And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed upon him with all diligence, whether it be unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.’
<br> 
<br>27Blessed be the LORD, the God of our fathers, who hath put such a thing as this in the king’s heart, to beautify the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem; 28and hath extended mercy unto me before the king, and his counsellors, and before all the king’s mighty princes. And I was strengthened according to the hand of the LORD my God upon me, and I gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up with me.
<br>Now these are the heads of their fathers’houses, and this is the genealogy of them that went up with me from Babylon, in the reign of Artaxerxes the king. 2Of the sons of Phinehas, Gershom; of the sons of Ithamar, Daniel; of the sons of David, Hattush. 3Of the sons of Shecaniah: of the sons of Parosh, Zechariah; and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males a hundred and fifty. 4Of the sons of Pahath-moab, Eliehoenai the son of Zerahiah; and with him two hundred	males.	5Of	the	sons	of Shechaniah, the son of Jahaziel; and with him three hundred males. 6And of the sons of Adin, Ebed the son of Jonathan; and with him fifty males. 7And of the sons of Elam, Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah; and with him seventy males. 8And of the sons of Shephatiah, Zebadiah the son of Michael; and with him fourscore males. 9Of the sons of Joab, Obadiah the son of Jehiel; and with him two hundred and eighteen males. 10And of the sons of Shelomith, the son of Josiphiah; and with him a
<br> 
<br>hundred and threescore males. 11And of the sons of Bebai, Zechariah the son of Bebai; and with him twenty and eight males. 12And of the sons of Azgad, Johanan the son of Hakkatan; and with him a hundred and ten males. 13And of the sons of Adonikam, that were the last; and these are their names, Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah; and with them threescore males. 14And of the sons of Bigvai, Uthai and Zaccur; and with him seventy males.
<br>15And I gathered them together to the river that runneth to Ahava; and there we encamped three days; and I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi. 16Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, teachers. 17And I gave them commandment unto Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia; and I told them what they should say unto Iddo [and] his brother, who were set over the place Casiphia, that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our God. 18And according to the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of discretion, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen; 19and Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brethren and their sons, twenty; 20and of the Nethinim, whom David and the
<br> 
<br>princes had given for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinim; all of them were mentioned by name.
<br>21Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God, to seek of Him a straight way, for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance. 22For I was ashamed to ask of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way; because we had spoken unto the king, saying: ‘The hand of our God is upon all them that seek Him, for good; but His power and His wrath is against all them that forsake Him.’ 23So we fasted and besought our God for this; and He was entreated of us. 24Then I separated twelve of the chiefs of the priests, besides Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them, 25and weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering for the house of our God, which the king, and his counsellors, and his princes, and all Israel there present, had offered; 26I even weighed into their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels a hundred talents; of gold a hundred talents; 27and twenty bowels of gold, of a thousand darics; and two vessels of fine bright brass, precious as gold. 28And I said unto them: ‘Ye are holy unto the LORD, and the vessels are holy; and the silver and the gold are a freewill-offering unto the LORD, the God of your fathers. 29Watch ye, and keep them, until ye
<br> 
<br>weigh them before the chiefs of the priests and the Levites, and the princes of the fathers’houses of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the LORD.’ 30So the priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God.
<br>31Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem; and the hand of our God was upon us, and He delivered us from the hand of the enemy and lier-in-wait by the way. 32And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days. 33And on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels weighed in the house of our God into the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, the Levites; 34the whole by number and by weight; and all the weight was written at that time.
<br>35The children of the captivity, that were come out of exile, offered burnt- offerings unto the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he-goats for a sin- offering; all this was a burnt-offering unto the LORD. 36And they delivered the king’s commissions unto the king’s satraps, and to the governors beyond the River; and they furthered the people and the house of God.
<br> 
<br>Now when these things were done, the princes drew near unto
<br>me, saying: ‘The people of Israel, and the priests and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands, doing according to their abominations, even of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites. 2For they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons; so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the peoples of the lands; yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been first in this faithlessness.’ 3And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down appalled. 4Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the faithlessness of them of the captivity; and I sat appalled until the evening offering.
<br>5And at the evening offering I arose up from my fasting, even with my garment and my mantle rent; and I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands unto the LORD my God; 6and I said: ‘O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to Thee, my God; for our iniquities are increased over our head, and our guiltiness is grown up unto the heavens. 7Since the days of our fathers we have been exceeding guilty unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and
<br> 
<br>our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to spoiling, and to confusion of face, as it is this day. 8And now for a little moment grace hath been shown from the LORD our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in His holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage. 9For we are bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage, but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair the ruins thereof, and to give us a fence in Judah and in Jerusalem. 10And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken Thy commandments, 11which Thou hast commanded by Thy servants the prophets, saying: The land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land through the uncleanness of the peoples of the lands, through their abominations, wherewith they have filled it from one end to another with their filthiness. 12Now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither take their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or their prosperity for ever; that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever. 13And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great guilt, seeing that Thou our God hast punished us less than our
<br> 
<br>iniquities deserve, and hast given us such a remnant, 14shall we again break Thy commandments, and make marriages with the peoples that do these abominations? wouldest not Thou be angry with us till Thou hadst consumed us, so that there should be no remnant, nor any to escape? 15O LORD, the God of Israel, Thou art righteous; for we are left a remnant that is escaped, as it is this day; behold, we are before Thee in our guiltiness; for none can stand before Thee because of this.’
<br>Now while Ezra prayed, and made confession, weeping and
<br>casting himself down before the house of God, there was gathered together unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children; for the people wept very sore. 2And Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said unto Ezra: ‘We have broken faith with our God, and have married foreign women of the peoples of the land; yet now there is hope for Israel concerning this thing. 3Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of the LORD, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law. 4Arise; for the matter belongeth unto thee, and we are with thee; be of good courage, and do it.’
<br>5Then arose Ezra, and made the chiefs of the priests, the Levites, and
<br> 
<br>all Israel, to swear that they would do according to this word. So they swore. 6Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib; and when he came thither, he did eat no bread, nor drink water; for he mourned because of the faithlessness of them of the captivity. 7And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem; 8and that whosoever came not within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the congregation of the captivity.
<br>9Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem within the three days; it was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month; and all the people sat in the broad place before the house of God, trembling because of this matter, and for the great rain. 10And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them: ‘Ye have broken faith, and have married foreign women, to increase the guilt of Israel. 11Now therefore make confession unto the LORD, the God of your fathers, and do His pleasure; and separate yourselves from the peoples of the land, and from the foreign women.’ 12Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice: ‘As thou hast said, so it is for us to do. 13But the people are
<br> 
<br>many, and it is a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand without, neither is this a work of one day or two; for we have greatly transgressed in this matter. 14Let now our princes of all the congregation stand, and let all them that are in our cities that have married foreign women come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God be turned from us, as touching this matter.’ 15Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah stood up against this matter; and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them. 16And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest, with certain heads of fathers’houses,	after	their fathers’houses, and all of them by their names, were separated; and they sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter. 17And they were finished with all the men that had married foreign women by the first day of the first month.
<br>18And among the sons of the priests there were found that had married foreign women, namely: of the sons of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and his brethren, Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah. 19And they gave their hand that they would put away their wives; and being guilty, [they offered] a ram of the flock for their guilt. 20And of the sons of Immer: Hanani and Zebadiah. 21And of the sons of Harim: Maaseiah, and Elijah,
<br> 
<br>and Shemaiah, and Jehiel, and Uzziah. 22And of the sons of Pashhur: Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethanel, Jozabad, and Elasah. 23And of the Levites: Jozabad, and Shimei, and Kelaiah— the same is Kelita—Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer. 24And of the singers: Eliashib; and of the porters: Shallum, and Telem, and Uri. 25And of Israel: of the sons of Parosh: Ramiah, and Izziah, and Malchijah, and Mijamin, and Eleazar, and Malchijah, and Benaiah. 26And of the sons of Elam: Mattaniah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, and Abdi, and Jeremoth, and Elijah. 27And of the sons of Zattu: Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, and Jeremoth, and Zabad, and Aziza. 28And of the sons of Bebai: Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, Athlai. 29And of the sons of Bani: Meshullam, Malluch, and Adaiah, Jashub, and Sheal, and Ramoth. 30And of the sons of Pahath-moab: Adna, and Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezalel, and Binnui, and Manasseh. 31And of the sons of Harim: Eliezer, Isshijah, Malchijah, Shemaiah, Shimeon; 32Benjamin, Malluch, Shemariah. 33Of the sons of Hashum: Mattenai, Mattattah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, Shimei. 34Of the sons of Bani: Maadai, Amram, and Uel; 35Benaiah, Bedeiah, Cheluhu; 36Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib; 37Mattaniah, Mattenai, and Jaasai; 38and Bani, and Binnui, Shimei; 39Shelemiah, and Nathan, and Adaiah; 40Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai; 41Azarel, and Shelemiah, Shemariah;
<br> 
<br>42Shallum, Amariah, Joseph. 43Of the sons of Nebo: Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jaddai, and Joel, Benaiah.
<br> 
<br>44All these had taken foreign wives; and some of them had wives by whom they had children.

<br>NEHEMIAH
<br> 
<br>THE WORDS of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah.
<br>Now it came to pass in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the castle, 2that Hanani, one of my brethren, came out of Judah, he and certain men; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, that were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem. 3And they said unto me: ‘The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach; the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.’ 4And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days; and I fasted and prayed before the God of heaven, 5and said: ‘I beseech Thee, O LORD, the God of heaven, the great and awful God, that keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love Him and keep His commandments; 6let Thine ear now be attentive, and Thine eyes open, that Thou mayest hearken unto the prayer of Thy servant, which I pray before Thee at this time, day and night, for the children of Israel Thy servants,
<br> 
<br>while I confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against Thee; yea, I and my father’s house have sinned. 7We have dealt very corruptly against Thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances which Thou didst command Thy servant Moses. 8Remember, I beseech Thee, the word that Thou didst command Thy servant Moses, saying: If ye deal treacherously, I will scatter you abroad among the peoples; 9but if ye return unto Me, and keep My commandments and do them, though your dispersed were in the uttermost part of the heaven, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to cause My name to dwell there. 10Now these are Thy servants and Thy people, whom Thou hast redeemed by Thy great power, and by Thy strong hand. 11O Lord, I beseech Thee, let now Thine ear be attentive to the prayer of Thy servant, and to the prayer of Thy servants, who delight to fear Thy name; and prosper, I pray Thee, Thy servant this day, and grant him mercy
<br> 
<br>in the sight of this man.’ Now I was cupbearer to the king.
<br>And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, when wine was before him, that I took up the wine, and gave it unto the king. Now I had not	been	beforetime			sad		in	his presence. 2And the king said unto me: ‘Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart.’ Then I was very sore afraid. 3And I said unto the king: ‘Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city,		the	place	of		my		fathers’ sepulchres, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?’ 4Then the king said unto me: ‘For what dost thou make request?’ So I prayed to the God of heaven. 5And I said unto the king: ‘If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah,		unto	the		city	of	my fathers’sepulchres, that I may build it.’ 6And the king said unto me, the queen also sitting by him: ‘For how long shall thy journey be?  and when wilt thou return?’ So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time. 7Moreover I said unto the king: ‘If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the River, that they may let me pass through till I come unto Judah; 8and a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king’s park, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the castle which
<br> 
<br>appertaineth to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into.’ And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.
<br>9Then I came to the governors beyond the River, and gave them the king’s letters. Now the king had sent with me captains of the army and horsemen. 10And when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly, for that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel. 11So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days. 12And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God put into my heart to do for Jerusalem; neither was there any beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon. 13And I went out by night by the valley gate, even toward the dragon’s well, and to the dung gate, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire. 14Then I went on to the fountain gate and to the king’s pool; but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass. 15Then went I up in the night in the valley, and viewed the wall; and I turned back, and entered by the valley gate, and so returned. 16And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.
<br> 
<br>17Then said I unto them: ‘Ye see the evil case that we are in, how Jerusalem lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire; come and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach.’ 18And I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as also of the king’s words that he had spoken unto me. And they said: ‘Let us rise up and build.’ So they strengthened their hands for the good work. 19But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said: ‘What is this thing that ye do? will ye rebel against the king?’ 20Then answered I them, and said unto them: ‘The God of heaven, He will prosper us; therefore we His servants will arise and build; but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.’
<br>Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests,
<br>and they builded the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and set up the doors of it; even unto the tower of Hammeah they sanctified it, unto the tower of Hananel. 2And next unto him builded the men of Jericho. And next to them builded Zaccur the son of Imri. 3And the fish gate did the sons of Hassenaah build; they laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, the bolts thereof, and the bars thereof. 4And next unto them repaired Meremoth the son of Uriah, the son of Hakkoz. And next unto them repaired Meshullam
<br> 
<br>the son of Berechiah, the son of Meshezabel. And next unto them repaired Zadok the son of Baana. 5And next unto them the Tekoites repaired; and their nobles put not their necks to the work of their lord. 6And the gate of the old city repaired Joiada the son of Paseah and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah; they laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, and the bolts thereof, and the bars thereof. 7And next unto them repaired Melatiah the Gibeonite, and Jadon the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon, and of Mizpah, for them that appertained to the throne of the governor beyond the River. 8Next unto him repaired Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, goldsmiths. And next unto him repaired Hananiah one of the perfumers, and they restored Jerusalem even unto the broad wall. 9And next unto them repaired Rephaiah the son of Hur, the ruler of half the district of Jerusalem. 10And next unto them repaired Jedaiah the son of Harumaph, even over against his house. And next unto him repaired Hattush the son of Hashabneiah. 11Malchijah the son of Harim, and Hasshub the son of Pahath- moab, repaired another portion, and the tower of the furnaces. 12And next unto him repaired Shallum the son of Hallohesh, the ruler of half the district of Jerusalem, he and his daughters. 13The valley gate repaired Hanun, and the inhabitants of Zanoah; they built it, and set up the doors thereof, the bolts thereof, and the bars thereof, and a
<br> 
<br>thousand cubits of the wall unto the dung gate. 14And the dung gate repaired Malchijah the son of Rechab, the ruler of the district of Beth- cherem; he built it, and set up the doors thereof, the bolts thereof, and the bars thereof. 15And the fountain gate repaired Shallun the son of Colhozeh, the ruler of the district of Mizpah; he built it, and covered it, and set up the doors thereof, the bolts thereof, and the bars thereof, and the wall of the pool of Shelah by the king’s garden, even unto the stairs that go down from the city of David. 16After him repaired Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the ruler of half the district of Beth-zur, unto the place over against the sepulchres of David, and unto the pool that was made, and unto the house of the mighty men. 17After him repaired the Levites, Rehum the son of Bani. Next unto him repaired Hashabiah, the ruler of half the district of Keilah, for his district. 18After him repaired their brethren, Bavvai the son of Henadad, the ruler of half the district of Keilah. 19And next to him repaired Ezer the son of Jeshua, the ruler of Mizpah, another portion, over against the ascent to the armoury at the Turning. 20After him Baruch the son of Zaccai earnestly repaired another portion, from the Turning unto the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest. 21After him repaired Meremoth the son of Uriah the son of Hakkoz another portion, from the door of the house of Eliashib even to the end of
<br> 
<br>the house of Eliashib. 22And after him repaired the priests, the men of the Plain. 23After them repaired Benjamin and Hasshub over against their house. After them repaired Azariah the son of Maaseiah the son of Ananiah beside his own house. 24After him repaired Binnui the son of Henadad another portion, from the house of Azariah unto the Turning and unto the corner. 25Palal the son of Uzai repaired over against the Turning, and the tower that standeth out from the upper house of the king, which is by the court of the guard. After him Pedaiah the son of Parosh repaired.— 26Now the Nethinim dwelt in Ophel, unto the place over against the water gate toward the east, and the tower that standeth out.— 27After him the Tekoites repaired another portion, over against the great tower that standeth out, and unto the wall of Ophel. 28Above the horse gate repaired the priests, every one over against his own house. 29After them repaired Zadok the son of Immer over against his own house. And after him repaired Shemaiah the son of Shecaniah, the keeper of the east gate. 30After him repaired Hananiah the son of Shelemiah, and Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph, another portion. After him repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah over against his chamber. 31After him repaired Malchijah one of the goldsmiths unto the house of the Nethinim, and of the merchants, over against the gate of Hammiphkad, and
<br> 
<br>to the upper chamber of the corner. 32And between the upper chamber of the corner and the sheep gate repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants.
<br>33But it came to pass that, when Sanballat heard that we builded the wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews. 34And he spoke before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said: ‘What do these feeble Jews? will they restore at will? will they sacrifice? will they make an end this day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish, seeing they are burned?’ 35Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said: ‘Even that which they build, if a fox go up, he shall break down their stone wall.’ 36Hear, O our God; for we are despised; and turn back their reproach upon their own head, and give them up to spoiling in a land of captivity; 37and cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before Thee; for they have vexed Thee before the builders. 38So we built the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto half the height thereof; for the people had a mind to work.
<br>But it came to pass that, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem went forward, and that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth; 2and they conspired all of them together to come and fight against
<br> 
<br>Jerusalem, and to cause confusion therein. 3But we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them. 4And Judah said: ‘The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall.’ 5And our adversaries said: ‘They shall not know, neither see, till we come into the midst of them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease.’ 6And it came to pass that, when the Jews that dwelt by them came, they said unto us ten times: ‘Ye must return unto us from all places.’ 7Therefore set I in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, in the open places, I even set the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows. 8And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people: ‘Be not ye afraid of them; remember the Lord, who is great and awful, and fight for your brethren, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your houses.’
<br>9And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work. 10And it came to pass from that time forth, that half of my servants wrought in the work, and half of them held the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the coats of mail; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah. 11They that builded the wall and they that bore
<br> 
<br>burdens laded themselves, every one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other held his weapon; 12and the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and so builded. And he that sounded the horn was by me. 13And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers and to the rest of the people: ‘The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another; 14in what place soever ye hear the sound of the horn, resort ye thither unto us; our God will fight for us.’
<br>15So we wrought in the work; and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared. 16Likewise at the same time said I unto the people: ‘Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and may labour in the day.’ 17So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard that followed me, none of us put off our clothes, every one that went to the water had his weapon.
<br>
<br>Then there arose a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews. 2For there were that said: ‘We, our sons and our daughters, are many; let us get for them corn, that we may eat and live.’ 3Some also there were that said: ‘We are mortgaging our fields, and our vineyards, and our houses; let us get corn, because of the dearth.’ 4There were	also	that	said:	‘We	have
<br> 
<br>borrowed money for the king’s tribute upon our fields and our vineyards. 5Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children; and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought into bondage already; neither is it in our power to help it; for other men have our fields and our vineyards.’
<br>6And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words. 7Then I consulted with myself, and contended with the nobles and the rulers, and said unto them: ‘Ye lend upon pledge, every one to his brother.’ And I held a great assembly against them. 8And I said unto them: ‘We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, that sold themselves unto the heathen; and would ye nevertheless sell your brethren, and should they sell themselves unto us?’ Then held they their peace, and found never a word. 9Also I said: ‘The thing that ye do is not good; ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God, because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies? 10And I likewise, my brethren and my servants, have lent them money and corn. I pray you, let us leave off this exaction. 11Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their fields, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundred pieces of silver, and the corn, the wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them.’ 12Then said they: ‘We will restore them, and will
<br> 
<br>require nothing of them; so will we do, even as thou sayest.’ Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise. 13Also I shook out my lap, and said: ‘So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this promise; even thus be he shaken out, and emptied.’ And all the congregation said: ‘Amen’, and praised the LORD. And the people did according to this promise.
<br>14Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor. 15But the former governors that were before me laid burdens upon the people, and took of them for bread and wine above forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants lorded over the people; but so did not I, because of the fear of God. 16Yea, also I set hand to the work of this wall, neither bought we any land; and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work. 17Moreover there were at my table of the Jews and the rulers a hundred and fifty men, beside those that came unto us from among the nations that were round about us. 18Now that which was prepared for one day was one ox and six choice sheep, also fowls were prepared for me; and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine; yet for all this I demanded not the bread of the
<br> 
<br>governor, because the service was heavy upon this people. 19Remember unto me, O my God, for good, all that I have done for this people.
<br>Now it came to pass, when it was reported to Sanballat and Tobiah,
<br>and to Geshem the Arabian, and unto the rest of our enemies, that I had builded the wall, and that there was no breach left therein—though even unto that time I had not set up the doors in the gates— 2that Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying: ‘Come, let us meet together in one of the villages in the plain of Ono.’ But they thought to do me mischief. 3And I sent messengers unto them, saying: ‘I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down; why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?’ 4And they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner. 5Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand; 6wherein was written: ‘It is reported among the nations, and aGeshem saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel; for which cause thou buildest the wall; and thou wouldest be their king, even according to these words. 7And thou hast also appointed prophets to proclaim of thee at Jerusalem, saying: There is a king in Judah; and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words.
<br>Come now therefore, and let us take
<br>
<br>a Heb. Gashmu.
<br> 
<br>counsel together.’ 8Then I sent unto him, saying: ‘There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.’ 9For they all would have us afraid, saying: ‘Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done.’ But now, strengthen Thou my hands.
<br>10And as for me, I went unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel, who was shut up; and he said: ‘Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple; for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.’ 11And I said: ‘Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being such as I, could go into the temple and live? I will not go in.’ 12And I discerned, and, lo, God had not sent him; for he pronounced this prophecy against me, whereas Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. 13For this cause was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might taunt me. 14Remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have me put in fear.
<br>15So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days. 16And it came to pass, when all our enemies heard thereof, that all the nations that were about us feared, and were much cast
<br> 
<br>down in their own eyes; for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God. 17Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them. 18For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah to wife. 19Also they spoke of his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.
<br>Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up
<br>the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed, 2that I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the governor of the castle, charge over Jerusalem; for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many. 3And I said unto them: ‘Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand on guard, let them shut the doors, and bar ye them; and let watches be appointed of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one to be over against his house.’ 4Now the city was wide and large; but the people were few therein, and the houses were not builded. 5And my God put into my heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found the book of the genealogy of
<br> 
<br>them that came up at the first, and I found written therein:
<br>
<br>6These are the children of the province, that went up out of the captivity of those that had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and that returned unto Jerusalem and to Judah, every one unto his city; 7who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah.

<br>45The porters: the children of Shallum, the children of Ater, the children of Talmon, the children of Akkub, the children of Hatita, the children of Shobai, a hundred thirty and eight.
<br>
<br>46The Nethinim: the children of Ziha, the children of Hasupha, the children of Tabbaoth; 47the children of Keros, the children of Sia, the children of Padon; 48the children of Lebanah,
<br> 
<br>the children of Hagaba, the children of Salmai; 49the children of Hanan, the children of Giddel, the children of Gahar; 50the children of Reaiah, the children of Rezin, the children of Nekoda; 51the children of Gazzam, the children of Uzza, the children of Paseah; 52the children of Besai, the children of Meunim, the children of Nephishesim; 53the children of Bakbuk, the children of Hakupha, the children of Harhur; 54the children of Bazlith, the children of Mehida, the children of Harsha; 55the children of Barkos, the children of Sisera, the children of Temah; 56the children of Neziah, the children of Hatipha.
<br>57The children of Solomon’s servants: the children of Sotai, the children of Sophereth, the children of Perida; 58the children of Jala, the children of Darkon, the children of Giddel; 59the children of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the children of Pochereth-hazzebaim, the children of Amon.
<br>60All the Nethinim, and the children of Solomon’s servants, were three hundred ninety and two.
<br>
<br>61And these were they that went up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer; but they could not tell their fathers’houses, nor their seed, whether they were of Israel: 62the children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred forty and two. 63And of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the
<br> 
<br>children of Hakkoz, the children of Barzillai, who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called after their name. 64These sought their register, that is, the genealogy, but it was not found; therefore were they deemed polluted and put from the priesthood. 65And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and Thummim.
<br>
<br>66The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore, 67beside their men-servants and their maid-servants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven; and they had two hundred forty and five singing men and singing women. [a68Their horses were seven hundred thirty and six; their mules, two hundred forty and five;] 69their camels, four hundred thirty and five; their asses, six thousand seven hundred and twenty.
<br>70And some from among the heads of fathers’houses gave unto the work. The Tirshatha gave to the treasury a thousand darics of gold, fifty basins, five hundred and thirty priests’tunics. 71And some of the heads of fathers’houses gave into the treasury of the work twenty thousand darics of gold, and two thousand and two
<br>
<br>a This verse is placed in authorative codices in the margin.
<br> 
<br>hundred pounds of silver. 72And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand darics of gold, and two thousand pounds of silver, and threescore and seven priests’tunics.
<br>73So the priests, and the Levites, and the porters, and the singers, and some of the people, and the Nethinim, and all Israel, dwelt in their cities.
<br>
<br>And when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel were
<br>in their cities, 1all the people gathered themselves together as
<br>one man into the broad place that was before the water gate; and they spoke unto Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the Law of Moses, which the LORD had commanded to Israel. 2And Ezra the priest brought the Law before the congregation, both men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month. 3And he read therein before the broad place that was before the water gate from early morning until midday, in the presence of the men and the women, and of those that could understand; and the ears of all the people were attentive unto the book of the Law. 4And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Uriah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchijah, and Hashum,        and        Hashbaddanah,
<br> 
<br>Zechariah, and Meshullam. 5And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people—for he was above all the people—and when he opened it, all the people stood up. 6And Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God. And all the people answered: ‘Amen, Amen’, with the lifting up of their hands; and they bowed their heads, and fell down before the LORD with their faces to the ground. 7Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, even the Levites,	caused	the	people		to understand the Law; and the people stood in their place. 8And they read in the	book,		in	the		Law	of	God, distinctly; and they gave the sense, and caused them to understand the reading. 9And Nehemiah, who was the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all the people: ‘This day is holy unto the LORD your God; mourn not, nor weep.’ For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the Law. 10Then he said unto them: ‘Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto him for whom nothing is prepared; for this day is holy unto our Lord; neither be ye grieved; for the joy of the LORD is your strength.’ 11So the Levites stilled all the people, saying: ‘Hold your peace, for the day is holy; neither be ye grieved.’ 12And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great
<br> 
<br>mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared unto them.
<br>13And on the second day were gathered together the heads of fathers’houses of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, unto Ezra the scribe, even to give attention to the words of the Law. 14And they found written in the Law, how that the LORD had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month; 15and that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying: ‘Go forth unto the mount, and fetch olive branches, and branches of wild olive, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written.’ 16So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the broad place of the water gate, and in the broad place of the gate of Ephraim. 17And all the congregation of them that were come back out of the captivity made booths, and dwelt in the booths; for since the days of aJoshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness. 18Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in the book of the Law of God. And they kept the feast seven days;
<br>
<br>a Heb. Jeshua.
<br> 
<br>and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according unto the ordinance.
<br>Now in the twenty and fourth day of this   month   the   children   of Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackcloth, and earth upon them. 2And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all foreigners, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers. 3And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the Law of the LORD their God a fourth part of the day; and another fourth	part	they	confessed,	and prostrated themselves before the LORD
<br>their God.
<br>4Then stood up upon the platform of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, and cried with a loud voice unto the LORD their God. 5Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said: ‘Stand up and bless the LORD your God from everlasting to everlasting; and let them say: Blessed be Thy glorious Name, that is exalted above all blessing and praise.
<br>6Thou art the LORD, even Thou alone; Thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth and all things that are thereon, the seas and all that is in them, and Thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven worshippeth Thee. 7Thou art the LORD the God, who didst choose Abram, and broughtest
<br> 
<br>him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him the name of Abraham; 8and foundest his heart faithful before Thee, and madest a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite, and the Girgashite, even to give it unto his seed, and hast performed Thy words; for Thou art righteous; 9And Thou sawest the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest their cry by the Red Sea; 10and didst show signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land; for Thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them; and didst get Thee a name, as it is this day. 11And Thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their pursuers Thou didst cast into the depths, as a stone into the mighty waters. 12Moreover in a pillar of cloud Thou didst lead them by day; and in a pillar of fire by night, to give them light in the way wherein they should go. 13Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spokest with them from heaven, and gavest them right ordinances and laws of truth, good statutes and commandments; 14and madest known unto them Thy holy sabbath, and didst command them commandments, and statutes, and a law, by the hand of Moses Thy servant; 15and gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of
<br> 
<br>the rock for their thirst, and didst command them that they should go in to possess the land which Thou hadst lifted up Thy hand to give them.
<br>16But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their neck, and hearkened not to Thy commandments, 17and refused to hearken, neither were mindful of Thy wonders that Thou didst among them; but hardened their neck, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage; but Thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and full of compassion, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy, and forsookest them not. 18Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said: ‘This is thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations; 19yet Thou in Thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness; the pillar of cloud departed not from over them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to show them light, and the way wherein they should go. 20Thou gavest also Thy good spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not Thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst. 21Yea, forty years didst Thou sustain them in the wilderness, and they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet swelled not.
<br>22Moreover Thou gavest them kingdoms and peoples, which Thou didst allot quarter by quarter; so they possessed the land of Sihon, even the land of the king of Heshbon, and the
<br> 
<br>land of Og king of Bashan. 23Their children also didst Thou multiply as the stars of heaven, and didst bring them into the land, concerning which Thou didst say to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it. 24So the children went in and possessed the land, and Thou didst subdue before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the peoples of the land, that they might do with them as they would. 25And they took fortified cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all good things, cisterns hewn out, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit-trees in abundance; so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and luxuriated in Thy great goodness.
<br>26Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against Thee, and cast Thy law behind their back, and slew Thy prophets that did forewarn them to turn them back unto Thee, and they wrought great provocations. 27Therefore Thou didst deliver them into the hand of their adversaries, who distressed them; and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto Thee, Thou heardest from heaven; and according to Thy manifold mercies Thou gavest them saviours who might save them out of the hand of their adversaries. 28But after they had rest, they did evil again before Thee; therefore didst Thou leave them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion
<br> 
<br>over them; yet when they returned, and cried unto Thee, many times didst Thou hear from heaven, and deliver them according to Thy mercies; 29and didst forewarn them, that Thou mightest bring them back unto Thy law; yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto Thy commandments, but sinned against Thine ordinances, which if a man do, he shall live by them, and presented a stubborn shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear. 30Yet many years didst Thou extend mercy unto them, and didst forewarn them by Thy spirit through Thy prophets; yet would they not give ear; therefore gavest Thou them into the hand of the peoples of the lands. 31Nevertheless in Thy manifold mercies Thou didst not utterly consume them, nor forsake them; for Thou art a gracious and merciful God.
<br>32Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the awful God, who keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the travail seem little before Thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all Thy people, since the time of the kings of Assyria unto this day. 33Howbeit Thou art just in all that is come upon us; for Thou hast dealt truly, but we have done wickedly; 34neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept Thy law, nor hearkened unto Thy commandments and  Thy testimonies,
<br> 
<br>wherewith Thou didst testify against them. 35For they have not served Thee in their kingdom, and in Thy great goodness that Thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land which Thou gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works. 36Behold, we are servants this day, and as for the land that Thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold, we are servants in it. 37And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom Thou hast set over us because of our sins; also they have power over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress.’
<br>And yet for all this we make a sure covenant, and subscribe
<br>it; and our princes, our Levites, and our priests, set their seal unto it.
<br>2Now those that set their seal were: Nehemiah the Tirshatha, the son of
<br>Hachaliah, and Zedekiah; 3Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah; 4Pashhur, Amariah, Malchijah; 5Hattush, Shebaniah, Malluch; 6Harim, Meremoth, Obadiah; 7Daniel, Ginnethon, Baruch; 8Meshullam, Abijah, Mijamin; 9Maaziah, Bilgai, Shemaiah. These were the priests.
<br>10And the Levites: Jeshua the son of Azaniah, Binnui of the sons of Henadad, Kadmiel; 11and their brethren, Shebaniah, Hodiah, Kelita, Pelaiah, Hanan; 12Mica, Rehob, Hashabiah; 13Zaccur, Sherebiah, Shebaniah; 14Hodiah, Bani, Beninu.
<br> 
<br>15The chiefs of the people: Parosh, Pahath-moab,    Elam,    Zattu,    Bani;
<br>16Bunni,   Azgad,   Bebai;   17Adonijah,
<br>Bigvai, Adin; 18Ater, Hezekiah, Azzur;
<br>19Hodiah, Hashum, Bezai; 20Hariph, Anathoth, Nebai; 21Magpiash, Meshullam, Hezir; 22Meshezabel, Zadok, Jaddua; 23Pelatiah, Hanan, Anaiah; 24Hoshea, Hananiah, Hasshub;
<br>25Hallohesh, Pilha, Shobek; 26Rehum,
<br>Hashabnah, Maaseiah; 27and Ahiah, Hanan, Anan; 28Malluch, Harim, Baanah.
<br>29And the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the porters, the singers, the Nethinim, and all they that had separated themselves from the peoples of the lands unto the law of God, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, every one that had knowledge and understanding; 30they cleaved to their brethren, their nobles, and entered into a curse, and into an oath, to walk in God’s law, which was given by Moses the servant of God, and to observe and do all the commandments of the LORD our Lord, and His ordinances and His statutes; 31and that we would not give our daughters unto the peoples of the land, nor take their daughters for our sons; 32and if the peoples of the land bring ware or any victuals on the sabbath day to sell, that we would not buy of them on the sabbath, or on a holy day; and that we would forego the seventh year, and the exaction of every debt.
<br>33Also we made ordinances for us, to charge ourselves yearly with the
<br> 
<br>third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our God; 34for the showbread, and for the continual meal- offering, and for the continual burnt- offering, of the sabbaths, of the new moons, for the appointed seasons, and for the holy things, and for the sin- offerings to make atonement for Israel, and for all the work of the house of our God. 35And we cast lots, the priests, the Levites, and the people, for the wood-offering, to bring it into the house of our God, according to our fathers’houses, at times appointed, year by year, to burn upon the altar of the LORD our God, as it is written in the Law; 36and to bring the first-fruits of our land, and the first-fruits of all fruit of all manner of trees, year by year, unto the house of the LORD; 37also the first-born of our sons, and of our cattle, as it is written in the Law, and the firstlings of our herds and of our flocks, to bring to the house of our God, unto the priests that minister in the house of our God; 38and that we should bring the first of our dough, and our heave-offerings, and the fruit of all manner of trees, the wine and the oil, unto the priests, to the chambers of the house of our God; and the tithes of our land unto the Levites; for they, the Levites, take the tithes in all the cities of our tillage. 39And the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites, when the Levites take tithes; and the Levites shall bring up the tithe of the tithes unto the house of our God, to the chambers, into the treasure-house.
<br> 
<br>40For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring the heave- offering of the corn, of the wine, and of the oil, unto the chambers, where are the vessels of the sanctuary, and the priests that minister, and the porters, and the singers; and we will not forsake the house of our God.
<br>And the princes of the people dwelt in Jerusalem; the rest of
<br>the people also cast lots, to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem the holy city, and nine parts in the other cities. 2And the people blessed all the men that willingly offered themselves to dwell in Jerusalem.
<br>3Now these are the chiefs of the province that dwelt in Jerusalem; but in the cities of Judah dwelt every one in his possession in their cities, to wit, Israelites, the priests, and the Levites, and the Nethinim, and the children of Solomon’s servants. 4And in Jerusalem dwelt certain of the children of Judah, and of the children of Benjamin.
<br>Of the children of Judah: Athaiah the son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah, the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalalel, of the children of Perez; 5and Maaseiah the son of Baruch, the son of Colhozeh, the son of Hazaiah, the son of Adaiah, the son of Joiarib, the son of Zechariah, the son of the Shilonite. 6All the sons of Perez that dwelt in Jerusalem were four hundred threescore and eight valiant men.
<br>7And these are the sons of Benjamin: Sallu the son of Meshullam,
<br> 
<br>the son of Joed, the son of Pedaiah, the son of Kolaiah, the son of Maaseiah, the son of Ithiel, the son of Jeshaiah. 8And after him Gabbai, Sallai, nine hundred twenty and eight. 9And Joel the son of Zichri was their overseer; and Judah the son of Hassenuah was second over the city.
<br>10Of the priests: Jedaiah the son of Joiarib, Jachin, 11Seraiah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the ruler of the house of God, 12and their brethren that did the work of the house, eight hundred twenty and two; and Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son of Pelaliah, the son of Amzi, the son of Zechariah, the son of Pashhur, the son of Malchijah, 13and his brethren, chiefs of fathers’houses, two hundred forty and two; and Amashsai the son of Azarel, the son of Ahzai, the son of Meshillemoth, the son of Immer, 14and their brethren, mighty men of valour, a hundred twenty and eight; and their overseer was Zabdiel, the son of Haggedolim.
<br>15And of the Levites: Shemaiah the son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Bunni; 16and Shabbethai and Jozabad, of the chiefs of the Levites, who had the oversight of the outward business of the house of God; 17and Mattaniah the son of Mica, the son of Zabdi, the son of Asaph, who was the chief to begin the thanksgiving in prayer, and Bakbukiah, the second among his brethren; and Abda the son of
<br> 
<br>Shammua, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun. 18All the Levites in the holy city were two hundred fourscore and four.
<br>19Moreover the porters, Akkub, Talmon, and their brethren, that kept watch at the gates, were a hundred seventy and two.
<br>20And the residue of Israel, of the priests, the Levites, were in all the cities of Judah, every one in his inheritance. 21But the Nethinim dwelt in Ophel; and Ziha and Gishpa were over the Nethinim.
<br>22The overseer also of the Levites at Jerusalem was Uzzi the son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Mica, of the sons of Asaph, the singers, over the business of the house of God. 23For there was a commandment from the king concerning them, and a sure ordinance concerning the singers, as every day required. 24And Pethahiah the son of Meshezabel, of the children of Zerah the son of Judah, was at the king’s hand in all matters concerning the people. 25And for the villages, with their fields, some of the children of Judah dwelt in Kiriath-arba and the towns thereof, and in Dibon and the towns thereof, and in Jekabzeel and the villages thereof; 26and in Jeshua, and in Moladah, and Beth-pelet; 27and in Hazar-shual, and in Beer-sheba and the towns thereof; 28and in Ziklag, and in Meconah and in the towns thereof; 29and in En-rimmon, and in Zorah, and in Jarmuth; 30Zanoah, Adullam, and
<br> 
<br>their villages, Lachish and the fields thereof, Azekah and the towns thereof. So they encamped from Beer-sheba unto the valley of Hinnom.
<br>31And the children of Benjamin from Geba onward, at Michmas and Aijah, and at Beth-el and the towns thereof; 32at Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah;
<br>33Hazor,   Ramah,   Gittaim;   34Hadid,
<br>Zeboim, Neballat; 35Lod, and Ono, Ge- harashim. 36And of the Levites, certain courses in Judah were joined to Benjamin.
<br>Now these are the priests and the Levites that went up with Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua:	Seraiah,	Jeremiah,		Ezra; 2Amariah,				Malluch,		Hattush; 3Shecaniah, Rehum, Meremoth; 4Iddo, Ginnethoi,			Abijah;	5Mijamin, Maadiah,			Bilgah;		6Shemaiah,		and Joiarib,		Jedaiah;			7Sallu,			Amok, Hilkiah, Jedaiah. These were the chiefs of the priests and their brethren in the
<br>days of Jeshua.
<br>8Moreover the Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah, who was over the thanksgiving, he and his brethren. 9Also Bakbukiah and Unni, their brethren, were over against them in wards.
<br>10And Jeshua begot Joiakim, and Joiakim begot Eliashib, and Eliashib begot Joiada, 11and Joiada begot Jonathan and Jonathan begot Jaddua.
<br>12And in the days of Joiakim were priests, heads of fathers’houses: of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah,
<br> 
<br>Hananiah; 13of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan; 14of Melicu, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph; 15of Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai; 16of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam; 17of Abijah, Zichri; of Miniamin; of Moadiah, Piltai; 18of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan; 19and of Joiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi; 20of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber; 21of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethanel.
<br>22The Levites in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan, and Jaddua, were recorded heads of fathers’houses; also the priests, in the reign of Darius the Persian.
<br>23The sons of Levi, heads of fathers’houses, were written in the book of the chronicles, even until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib. 24And the chiefs of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brethren over against them, to praise and give thanks, according to the commandment of David the man of God, ward against ward. 25Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub, were porters keeping the ward at the store-houses of the gates. 26These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest the scribe.
<br>
<br>27And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites
<br> 
<br>out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and with harps. 28And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both out of the Plain round about Jerusalem, and from the villages of the Netophathites; 29also from Beth-gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth; for the singers had builded them villages round about Jerusalem. 30And the priests and the Levites purified themselves; and they purified the people, and the gates, and the wall. 31Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and appointed two great companies that gave thanks and went in procession: on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate; 32and after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah; 33and Azariah,	Ezra,	and	Meshullam, 34Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah; 35and certain of the priests’sons with trumpets: Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph; 36and his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God; and Ezra the scribe was before them; 37and by the fountain gate, and straight before them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of the wall, above the house of David, even unto
<br> 
<br>the water gate eastward. 38And the other company of them that gave thanks went to meet them, and I after them, with the half of the people, upon the wall, above the tower of the furnaces, even unto the broad wall; 39and above the gate of Ephraim, and by the gate of the old city and by the fish gate, and the tower of Hananel, and the tower of Hammeah, even unto the sheep gate; and they stood still in the gate of the guard. 40So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me; 41and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets; 42and Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer. 43And they offered great sacrifices that day, and rejoiced; for God had made them rejoice with great joy; and the women also and the children rejoiced; so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.
<br>
<br>44And on that day were men appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the heave-offerings, for the first-fruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them, according to the fields of the cities, the portions appointed by the law for the priests and Levites; for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that took their stations. 45And they kept the ward
<br> 
<br>of their God, and the ward of the purification, and so did the singers and the porters, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon his son. 46For in the days of David and Asaph of old there were chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God. 47And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, as every day required; and they hallowed for the Levites; and the Levites hallowed for the sons of Aaron.
<br>On that day they read in the book of Moses in the hearing
<br>of the people; and therein was found written, that an Ammonite and a Moabite should not enter into the assembly of God for ever; 2because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, to curse them; howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing. 3And it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the alien mixture.
<br>
<br>4Now before this, Eliashib the priest, who was appointed over the chambers of the house of our God, being allied unto Tobiah, 5had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the meal- offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the wine, and the oil, which were given by
<br> 
<br>commandment to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the heave- offerings for the priests. 6But in all this time I was not at Jerusalem; for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I went unto the king, and after certain days asked I leave of the king; 7and I came to Jerusalem, and understood the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God. 8And it grieved me sore; therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber. 9Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers; and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meal-offerings and the frankincense.
<br>10And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them; so that the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were fled every one to his field. 11Then contended I with the rulers, and said: ‘Why is the house of God forsaken?’ And I gathered them together, and set them in their place. 12Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the wine and the oil unto the treasuries. 13And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah; and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were counted faithful, and their office was to distribute unto their brethren. 14Remember me, O my God,
<br> 
<br>concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the wards thereof.
<br>15In those days saw I in Judah some treading winepresses on the sabbath, and bringing in heaps of corn, and lading asses therewith; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day; and I forewarned them in the day wherein they sold victuals. 16There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, who brought in fish, and all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem. 17Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them: ‘What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day? 18Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.’
<br>19And it came to pass that, when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut, and commanded that they should not be opened till after the sabbath; and some of my servants set I over the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day. 20So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice. 21Then I forewarned them, and said unto them: ‘Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay
<br> 
<br>hands on you.’ From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath. 22And I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember unto me, O my God, this also, and spare me according to the greatness of Thy mercy.
<br>23In those days also saw I the Jews that had married women of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab; 24and their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews’language, but according to the language of each people. 25And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God: ‘Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons, or for yourselves. 26Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among
<br> 
<br>many nations was there no king like him, and he was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel; nevertheless even him did the foreign women cause to sin. 27Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to break faith with our God in marrying foreign women?’
<br>28And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite; therefore I chased him from me. 29Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.
<br>30Thus cleansed I them from everything foreign, and appointed wards for the priests and for the Levites, every one in his work; 31and for the wood-offering, at times appointed, and for the first-fruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.

<br> 
<br>utterly, unto this day, and dwelt in their stead; because there was pasture there for their flocks. 42And some of them, even of the sons of Simeon, five hundred men, went to mount Seir, having for their captains Pelatiah, and Neariah, and Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi. 43And they smote the remnant	of	the	Amalekites	that escaped, and dwelt there unto this day. And the sons of Reuben the first- born of Israel—for he was the
<br>first-born; but, forasmuch as he defiled his father’s couch, his birthright was given unto the sons of Joseph the son of Israel, yet not so that he was to be reckoned in the genealogy as first- born. 2For Judah prevailed above his brethren, and of him came he that is the prince; but the birthright was Joseph’s— 3the sons of Reuben the first-born of Israel: Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. 4The sons of Joel: Shemaiah his son, Gog his son, Shimei his son; 5Micah his son, Reaiah his son, Baal his son; 6Beerah his son, whom Tillegath-pilneser king of Assyria carried away captive; he was prince of the Reubenites. 7And his brethren by their families, when the genealogy of their generations was reckoned: the chief Jeiel, and Zechariah, 8and Bela the son of Azaz, the son of Shema, the son of Joel, who dwelt in Aroer, even unto Nebo and Baal-meon; 9and eastward he dwelt even unto the entrance of the wilderness from the river Euphrates; because their cattle were multiplied in
