<br>(7) to reduce the environmental impacts of freight movement on the National Highway Freight Network.
<br>
<br>(c) Establishment of National Highway Freight Network.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—The Administrator shall establish a National Highway Freight Network in accordance with this section to strategically direct Federal resources and policies toward improved performance of the Network.
<br>
<br>(2) Network components.—The National Highway Freight Network shall consist of—
<br>
<br>(A) the primary highway freight system, as designated under subsection (d);

<br>
<br>(D) Input.—In redesignating the primary highway freight system, the Administrator shall provide an opportunity for State freight advisory committees, as applicable, to submit additional miles for consideration.
<br>
<br>(E) Factors for redesignation.—In redesignating the primary highway freight system, the Administrator shall consider—
<br>
<br>(i) changes in the origins and destinations of freight movement in, to, and from the United States;
<br>
<br>(ii) changes in the percentage of annual daily truck traffic in the annual average daily traffic on principal arterials;
<br>
<br>(iii) changes in the location of key facilities;
<br>
<br>(iv) land and water ports of entry;
<br>
<br>(v) access to energy exploration, development, installation, or production areas;
<br>
<br>(vi) access to other freight intermodal facilities, including rail, air, water, and pipelines facilities;
<br>
<br>(vii) the total freight tonnage and value moved via highways;
<br>
<br>(viii) significant freight bottlenecks, as identified by the Administrator;
<br>
<br>(ix) the significance of goods movement on principal arterials, including consideration of global and domestic supply chains;
<br>
<br>(x) critical emerging freight corridors and critical commerce corridors; and
<br>
<br>(xi) network connectivity.
<br>
<br>(e) Critical Rural Freight Corridors.—
<br>
<br>(1) In general.—A State may designate a public road within the borders of the State as a critical rural freight corridor if the public road is not in an urbanized area and—
<br>
<br>(A) is a rural principal arterial roadway and has a minimum of 25 percent of the annual average daily traffic of the road measured in passenger vehicle equivalent units from trucks (Federal Highway Administration vehicle class 8 to 13);
<br>
<br>(B) provides access to energy exploration, development, installation, or production areas;
<br>
<br>(C) connects the primary highway freight system, a roadway described in subparagraph (A) or (B), or the Interstate System to facilities that handle more than—
<br>
<br>(i) 50,000 20-foot equivalent units per year; or
<br>
<br>(ii) 500,000 tons per year of bulk commodities;
<br>
<br>(D) provides access to—
<br>
<br>(i) a grain elevator;
<br>
<br>(ii) an agricultural facility;
<br>
<br>(iii) a mining facility;
<br>
<br>(iv) a forestry facility; or
<br>
<br>(v) an intermodal facility;
<br>
<br>(E) connects to an international port of entry;
<br>
<br>(F) provides access to significant air, rail, water, or other freight facilities in the State; or
<br>
<br>(G) is, in the determination of the State, vital to improving the efficient movement of freight of importance to the economy of the State.
<br>
<br>(2) Limitation.—A State may designate as critical rural freight corridors a maximum of 150 miles of highway or 20 percent of the primary highway freight system mileage in the State, whichever is greater.
<br>
<br>(f) Critical Urban Freight Corridors.—
<br>
<br>(1) Urbanized area with population of 500,000 or more.—In an urbanized area with a population of 500,000 or more individuals, the representative metropolitan planning organization, in consultation with the State, may designate a public road within the borders of that area of the State as a critical urban freight corridor.
<br>
<br>(2) Urbanized area with a population less than 500,000.—In an urbanized area with a population of less than 500,000 individuals, the State, in consultation with the representative metropolitan planning organization, may designate a public road within the borders of that area of the State as a critical urban freight corridor.
<br>
<br>(3) Requirements for designation.—A designation may be made under paragraph (1) or (2) if the public road—
<br>
<br>(A) is in an urbanized area, regardless of population; and
