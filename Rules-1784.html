<br>§1725. Reimbursement for emergency treatment
<br>
<br>(a) General Authority.—(1) Subject to subsections (c) and (d), the Secretary shall reimburse a veteran described in subsection (b) for the reasonable value of emergency treatment furnished the veteran in a non-Department facility.
<br>
<br>(2) In any case in which reimbursement is authorized under subsection (a)(1), the Secretary, in the Secretary's discretion, may, in lieu of reimbursing the veteran, make payment of the reasonable value of the furnished emergency treatment directly—
<br>
<br>(A) to a hospital or other health care provider that furnished the treatment; or
<br>
<br>(B) to the person or organization that paid for such treatment on behalf of the veteran.
<br>
<br>(b) Eligibility.—(1) A veteran referred to in subsection (a)(1) is an individual who is an active Department health-care participant who is personally liable for emergency treatment furnished the veteran in a non-Department facility.
<br>
<br>(2) A veteran is an active Department health-care participant if—
<br>
<br>(A) the veteran is enrolled in the health care system established under section 1705(a) of this title; and
<br>
<br>(B) the veteran received care under this chapter within the 24-month period preceding the furnishing of such emergency treatment.
<br>
<br>(3) A veteran is personally liable for emergency treatment furnished the veteran in a non-Department facility if the veteran—
<br>
<br>(A) is financially liable to the provider of emergency treatment for that treatment;
<br>
<br>(B) has no entitlement to care or services under a health-plan contract (determined, in the case of a health-plan contract as defined in subsection (f)(2)(B) or (f)(2)(C), without regard to any requirement or limitation relating to eligibility for care or services from any department or agency of the United States);
<br>
<br>(C) has no other contractual or legal recourse against a third party that would, in whole, extinguish such liability to the provider; and
<br>
<br>(D) is not eligible for reimbursement for medical care or services under section 1728 of this title.
<br>
<br>(c) Limitations on Reimbursement.—(1) The Secretary, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, shall—
<br>
<br>(A) establish the maximum amount payable under subsection (a);
<br>
<br>(B) delineate the circumstances under which such payments may be made, to include such requirements on requesting reimbursement as the Secretary shall establish; and
<br>
<br>(C) provide that in no event may a payment under that subsection include any amount for which the veteran is not personally liable.
<br>
<br>(2) Subject to paragraph (1), the Secretary may provide reimbursement under this section only after the veteran or the provider of emergency treatment has exhausted without success all claims and remedies reasonably available to the veteran or provider against a third party for payment of such treatment.
<br>
<br>(3) Payment by the Secretary under this section on behalf of a veteran to a provider of emergency treatment shall, unless rejected and refunded by the provider within 30 days of receipt, extinguish any liability on the part of the veteran for that treatment. Neither the absence of a contract or agreement between the Secretary and the provider nor any provision of a contract, agreement, or assignment to the contrary shall operate to modify, limit, or negate the requirement in the preceding sentence.
<br>
<br>(4)(A) If the veteran has contractual or legal recourse against a third party that would only, in part, extinguish the veteran's liability to the provider of the emergency treatment, and payment for the treatment may be made both under subsection (a) and by the third party, the amount payable for such treatment under such subsection shall be the amount by which the costs for the emergency treatment exceed the amount payable or paid by the third party, except that the amount payable may not exceed the maximum amount payable established under paragraph (1)(A).
<br>
<br>(B) In any case in which a third party is financially responsible for part of the veteran's emergency treatment expenses, the Secretary shall be the secondary payer.
<br>
<br>(C) A payment in the amount payable under subparagraph (A) shall be considered payment in full and shall extinguish the veteran's liability to the provider.
<br>
<br>(D) The Secretary may not reimburse a veteran under this section for any copayment or similar payment that the veteran owes the third party or for which the veteran is responsible under a health-plan contract.
<br>
<br>(d) Independent Right of Recovery.—(1) In accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, the United States shall have the independent right to recover any amount paid under this section when, and to the extent that, a third party subsequently makes a payment for the same emergency treatment.
<br>
<br>(2) Any amount paid by the United States to the veteran (or the veteran's personal representative, successor, dependents, or survivors) or to any other person or organization paying for such treatment shall constitute a lien in favor of the United States against any recovery the payee subsequently receives from a third party for the same treatment.
<br>
<br>(3) Any amount paid by the United States to the provider that furnished the veteran's emergency treatment shall constitute a lien against any subsequent amount the provider receives from a third party for the same emergency treatment for which the United States made payment.
<br>
<br>(4) The veteran (or the veteran's personal representative, successor, dependents, or survivors) shall ensure that the Secretary is promptly notified of any payment received from any third party for emergency treatment furnished to the veteran. The veteran (or the veteran's personal representative, successor, dependents, or survivors) shall immediately forward all documents relating to such payment, cooperate with the Secretary in the investigation of such payment, and assist the Secretary in enforcing the United States right to recover any payment made under subsection (c)(3).
<br>
<br>(e) Waiver.—The Secretary, in the Secretary's discretion, may waive recovery of a payment made to a veteran under this section that is otherwise required by subsection (d)(1) when the Secretary determines that such waiver would be in the best interest of the United States, as defined by regulations prescribed by the Secretary.
<br>

<br>
<br>(1) The term "emergency treatment" means medical care or services furnished, in the judgment of the Secretary—
<br>
<br>(A) when Department or other Federal facilities are not feasibly available and an attempt to use them beforehand would not be reasonable;

<br>(a)(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, in any case in which the United States is required by law to furnish or pay for care or services under this chapter for a non-service-connected disability described in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the United States has the right to recover or collect from a third party the reasonable charges of care or services so furnished or paid for to the extent that the recipient or provider of the care or services would be eligible to receive payment for such care or services from such third party if the care or services had not been furnished or paid for by a department or agency of the United States.
<br>
<br>(2) Paragraph (1) of this subsection applies to a non-service-connected disability—

<br>(B) that is incurred as the result of a motor vehicle accident to which applies a State law that requires the owners or operators of motor vehicles registered in that State to have in force automobile accident reparations insurance;
<br>
<br>(C) that is incurred as the result of a crime of personal violence that occurred in a State, or a political subdivision of a State, in which a person injured as the result of such a crime is entitled to receive health care and services at such State's or subdivision's expense for personal injuries suffered as the result of such crime;
<br>
<br>(D) that is incurred by an individual who is entitled to care (or payment of the expenses of care) under a health-plan contract; or

<br>
<br>(i) has a service-connected disability; and
<br>
<br>(ii) is entitled to care (or payment of the expenses of care) under a health-plan contract.
<br>
<br>(3) In the case of a health-plan contract that contains a requirement for payment of a deductible or copayment by the individual—
<br>
<br>(A) the individual's not having paid such deductible or copayment with respect to care or services furnished under this chapter shall not preclude recovery or collection under this section; and
<br>
<br>(B) the amount that the United States may collect or recover under this section shall be reduced by the appropriate deductible or copayment amount, or both.
<br>
<br>(b)(1) As to the right provided in subsection (a) of this section, the United States shall be subrogated to any right or claim that the individual (or the individual's personal representative, successor, dependents, or survivors) may have against a third party.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) In order to enforce any right or claim to which the United States is subrogated under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the United States may intervene or join in any action or proceeding brought by the individual (or the individual's personal representative, successor, dependents, or survivors) against a third party.
<br>
<br>(B) The United States may institute and prosecute legal proceedings against the third party if—
<br>
<br>(i) an action or proceeding described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph is not begun within 180 days after the first day on which care or services for which recovery is sought are furnished to the individual by the Secretary under this chapter;
<br>

<br>
<br>(c)(1) The Secretary may compromise, settle, or waive any claim which the United States has under this section.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) The Secretary, after consultation with the Comptroller General of the United States, shall prescribe regulations for the purpose of determining reasonable charges for care or services under subsection (a)(1) of this section. Any determination of such charges shall be made in accordance with such regulations.
<br>
<br>(B) Such regulations shall provide that reasonable charges for care or services sought to be recovered or collected from a third-party liable under a health-plan contract may not exceed the amount that such third party demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary it would pay for the care or services if provided by facilities (other than facilities of departments or agencies of the United States) in the same geographic area.
<br>
<br>(C) Not later than 45 days after the date on which the Secretary prescribes such regulations (or any amendment to such regulations), the Comptroller General shall submit to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and the House of Representatives the Comptroller General's comments on and recommendations regarding such regulations (or amendment).
<br>
<br>(d) Any contract or agreement into which the Secretary enters with a person under section 3718 of title 31 for collection services to recover indebtedness owed the United States under this section shall provide, with respect to such services, that such person is subject to sections 5701 and 7332 of this title.

<br>(1) may not be denied such care or services by reason of this section; and
<br>
<br>(2) may not be required by reason of this section to make any copayment or deductible payment in order to receive such care.

<br>(B) that the provision of such care or services to the individual meets criteria generally applicable under the health-plan contract involved.
