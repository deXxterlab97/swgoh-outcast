<br>8551.
<br>General provisions.
<br>
<br>        
<br>§8501. Findings
<br>
<br>Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>(1) The illicit nuclear activities of the Government of Iran, combined with its development of unconventional weapons and ballistic missiles and its support for international terrorism, represent a threat to the security of the United States, its strong ally Israel, and other allies of the United States around the world.
<br>
<br>(2) The United States and other responsible countries have a vital interest in working together to prevent the Government of Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability.
<br>
<br>(3) The International Atomic Energy Agency has repeatedly called attention to Iran's illicit nuclear activities and, as a result, the United Nations Security Council has adopted a range of sanctions designed to encourage the Government of Iran to suspend those activities and comply with its obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at Washington, London, and Moscow July 1, 1968, and entered into force March 5, 1970 (commonly known as the "Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty").
<br>
<br>(4) The serious and urgent nature of the threat from Iran demands that the United States work together with its allies to do everything possible—diplomatically, politically, and economically—to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability.
<br>
<br>(5) The United States and its major European allies, including the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, have advocated that sanctions be strengthened should international diplomatic efforts fail to achieve verifiable suspension of Iran's uranium enrichment program and an end to its nuclear weapons program and other illicit nuclear activities.
<br>
<br>(6) The Government of Iran continues to engage in serious, systematic, and ongoing violations of human rights, including suppression of freedom of expression and religious freedom, illegitimately prolonged detention, torture, and executions. Such violations have increased in the aftermath of the fraudulent presidential election in Iran on June 12, 2009.
<br>
<br>(7) The Government of Iran has been unresponsive to President Obama's unprecedented and serious efforts at engagement, revealing that the Government of Iran is not interested in a diplomatic resolution, as made clear, for example, by the following:
<br>
<br>(A) Iran's apparent rejection of the Tehran Research Reactor plan, generously offered by the United States and its partners, of potentially great benefit to the people of Iran, and endorsed by Iran's own negotiators in October 2009.
<br>
<br>(B) Iran's ongoing clandestine nuclear program, as evidenced by its work on the secret uranium enrichment facility at Qom, its subsequent refusal to cooperate fully with inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, and its announcement that it would build 10 new uranium enrichment facilities.
<br>
<br>(C) Iran's official notification to the International Atomic Energy Agency that it would enrich uranium to the 20 percent level, followed soon thereafter by its providing to that Agency a laboratory result showing that Iran had indeed enriched some uranium to 19.8 percent.
<br>
<br>(D) A February 18, 2010, report by the International Atomic Energy Agency expressing "concerns about the possible existence in Iran of past or current undisclosed activities related to the development of a nuclear payload for a missile. These alleged activities consist of a number of projects and sub-projects, covering nuclear and missile related aspects, run by military-related organizations.".
<br>
<br>(E) A May 31, 2010, report by the International Atomic Energy Agency expressing continuing strong concerns about Iran's lack of cooperation with the Agency's verification efforts and Iran's ongoing enrichment activities, which are contrary to the longstanding demands of the Agency and the United Nations Security Council.
<br>
<br>(F) Iran's announcement in April 2010 that it had developed a new, faster generation of centrifuges for enriching uranium.
<br>
<br>(G) Iran's ongoing arms exports to, and support for, terrorists in direct contravention of United Nations Security Council resolutions.
<br>
<br>(H) Iran's July 31, 2009, arrest of 3 young citizens of the United States on spying charges.
<br>
<br>(8) There is an increasing interest by State governments, local governments, educational institutions, and private institutions, business firms, and other investors to disassociate themselves from companies that conduct business activities in the energy sector of Iran, since such business activities may directly or indirectly support the efforts of the Government of Iran to achieve a nuclear weapons capability.
<br>
<br>(9) Black market proliferation networks continue to flourish in the Middle East, allowing countries like Iran to gain access to sensitive dual-use technologies.
<br>
<br>(10) Economic sanctions imposed pursuant to the provisions of this Act, the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996, as amended by this Act, and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), and other authorities available to the United States to impose economic sanctions to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, are necessary to protect the essential security interests of the United States.

<br>§8513. Mandatory sanctions with respect to financial institutions that engage in certain transactions
<br>(a) Findings
<br>
<br>Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>(1) The Financial Action Task Force is an intergovernmental body whose purpose is to develop and promote national and international policies to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.
<br>
<br>(2) Thirty-three countries, plus the European Commission and the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf, belong to the Financial Action Task Force. The member countries of the Financial Action Task Force include the United States, Canada, most countries in western Europe, Russia, the People's Republic of China, Japan, South Korea, Argentina, and Brazil.
<br>
<br>(3) In 2008 the Financial Action Task Force extended its mandate to include addressing "new and emerging threats such as proliferation financing", meaning the financing of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and published "guidance papers" for members to assist them in implementing various United Nations Security Council resolutions dealing with weapons of mass destruction, including United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1737 (2006) and 1803 (2008), which deal specifically with proliferation by Iran.
<br>
<br>(4) The Financial Action Task Force has repeatedly called on members—
<br>
<br>(A) to advise financial institutions in their jurisdictions to give special attention to business relationships and transactions with Iran, including Iranian companies and financial institutions;
<br>
<br>(B) to apply effective countermeasures to protect their financial sectors from risks relating to money laundering and financing of terrorism that emanate from Iran;
<br>
<br>(C) to protect against correspondent relationships being used by Iran and Iranian companies and financial institutions to bypass or evade countermeasures and risk-mitigation practices; and
<br>
<br>(D) to take into account risks relating to money laundering and financing of terrorism when considering requests by Iranian financial institutions to open branches and subsidiaries in their jurisdictions.
<br>
<br>(5) At a February 2010 meeting of the Financial Action Task Force, the Task Force called on members to apply countermeasures "to protect the international financial system from the ongoing and substantial money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risks" emanating from Iran.
<br>(b) Sense of Congress regarding the imposition of sanctions on the Central Bank of Iran
<br>
<br>Congress—
<br>
<br>(1) acknowledges the efforts of the United Nations Security Council to impose limitations on transactions involving Iranian financial institutions, including the Central Bank of Iran; and
<br>
<br>(2) urges the President, in the strongest terms, to consider immediately using the authority of the President to impose sanctions on the Central Bank of Iran and any other Iranian financial institution engaged in proliferation activities or support of terrorist groups.
<br>(c) Prohibitions and conditions with respect to certain accounts held by foreign financial institutions
<br>(1) In general
<br>

<br>
<br>(B) facilitates the activities of—
<br>
<br>(i) a person subject to financial sanctions pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1737 (2006), 1747 (2007), 1803 (2008), or 1929 (2010), or any other resolution that is agreed to by the Security Council and imposes sanctions with respect to Iran; or
<br>
<br>(ii) a person acting on behalf of or at the direction of, or owned or controlled by, a person described in clause (i);
<br>
<br>(C) engages in money laundering to carry out an activity described in subparagraph (A) or (B);
<br>

<br>§8513a. Imposition of sanctions with respect to the financial sector of Iran
<br>(a) Findings
<br>
<br>Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>(1) On November 21, 2011, the Secretary of the Treasury issued a finding under section 5318A of title 31 that identified Iran as a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern.
<br>
<br>(2) In that finding, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Department of the Treasury wrote, "The Central Bank of Iran, which regulates Iranian banks, has assisted designated Iranian banks by transferring billions of dollars to these banks in 2011. In mid-2011, the CBI transferred several billion dollars to designated banks, including Saderat, Mellat, EDBI and Melli, through a variety of payment schemes. In making these transfers, the CBI attempted to evade sanctions by minimizing the direct involvement of large international banks with both CBI and designated Iranian banks.".
<br>
<br>(3) On November 22, 2011, the Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, David Cohen, wrote, "Treasury is calling out the entire Iranian banking sector, including the Central Bank of Iran, as posing terrorist financing, proliferation financing, and money laundering risks for the global financial system.".
<br>(b) Designation of financial sector of Iran as of primary money laundering concern
<br>
<br>The financial sector of Iran, including the Central Bank of Iran, is designated as a primary money laundering concern for purposes of section 5318A of title 31 because of the threat to government and financial institutions resulting from the illicit activities of the Government of Iran, including its pursuit of nuclear weapons, support for international terrorism, and efforts to deceive responsible financial institutions and evade sanctions.
<br>(c) Freezing of assets of Iranian financial institutions
<br>
<br>The President shall, pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), block and prohibit all transactions in all property and interests in property of an Iranian financial institution if such property and interests in property are in the United States, come within the United States, or are or come within the possession or control of a United States person.
<br>(d) Imposition of sanctions with respect to the Central Bank of Iran and other Iranian financial institutions
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Except as specifically provided in this subsection, beginning on the date that is 60 days after December 31, 2011, the President—
<br>
<br>(A) shall prohibit the opening, and prohibit or impose strict conditions on the maintaining, in the United States of a correspondent account or a payable-through account by a foreign financial institution that the President determines has knowingly conducted or facilitated any significant financial transaction with the Central Bank of Iran or another Iranian financial institution designated by the Secretary of the Treasury for the imposition of sanctions pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.); and
<br>
<br>(B) may impose sanctions pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) with respect to the Central Bank of Iran.
<br>(2) Exception for sales of agricultural commodities, food, medicine, and medical devices
<br>
<br>The President may not impose sanctions under paragraph (1) with respect to any person for conducting or facilitating a transaction for the sale of agricultural commodities, food, medicine, or medical devices to Iran.
<br>(3) Applicability of sanctions with respect to foreign central banks
<br>
<br>Except as provided in paragraph (4), sanctions imposed under paragraph (1)(A) shall apply with respect to a central bank of a foreign country, only insofar as it engages in a financial transaction for the sale or purchase of petroleum or petroleum products to or from Iran conducted or facilitated on or after that date that is 180 days after December 31, 2011.
<br>(4) Applicability of sanctions with respect to petroleum transactions
<br>(A) Report required
<br>
<br>Not later than October 25, 2012, and the last Thursday of every other month thereafter, the Administrator of the Energy Information Administration, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of State, and the Director of National Intelligence, shall submit to Congress a report on the availability and price of petroleum and petroleum products produced in countries other than Iran in the 2-month period preceding the submission of the report.
<br>(B) Determination required
<br>
<br>Not later than 90 days after December 31, 2011, and every 180 days thereafter, the President shall make a determination, based on the reports required by subparagraph (A), of whether the price and supply of petroleum and petroleum products produced in countries other than Iran is sufficient to permit purchasers of petroleum and petroleum products from Iran to reduce significantly in volume their purchases from Iran.
<br>(C) Application of sanctions
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subparagraph (D), sanctions imposed under paragraph (1)(A) shall apply with respect to a financial transaction conducted or facilitated by a foreign financial institution on or after the date that is 180 days after December 31, 2011, for the purchase of petroleum or petroleum products from Iran if the President determines pursuant to subparagraph (B) that there is a sufficient supply of petroleum and petroleum products from countries other than Iran to permit a significant reduction in the volume of petroleum and petroleum products purchased from Iran by or through foreign financial institutions.
<br>(D) Exception
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>Sanctions imposed pursuant to paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to a financial transaction described in clause (ii) conducted or facilitated by a foreign financial institution if the President determines and reports to Congress, not later than 90 days after the date on which the President makes the determination required by subparagraph (B), and every 180 days thereafter, that the country with primary jurisdiction over the foreign financial institution—
<br>
<br>(I) has significantly reduced reduced 1 its volume of crude oil purchases from Iran during the period beginning on the date on which the President submitted the last report with respect to the country under this subparagraph; or
<br>
<br>(II) in the case of a country that has previously received an exception under this subparagraph, has, after receiving the exception, reduced its crude oil purchases from Iran to zero.
<br>(ii) Financial transactions described
<br>
<br>A financial transaction conducted or facilitated by a foreign financial institution is described in this clause if—
<br>
<br>(I) the financial transaction is only for trade in goods or services between the country with primary jurisdiction over the foreign financial institution and Iran; and
<br>
<br>(II) any funds owed to Iran as a result of such trade are credited to an account located in the country with primary jurisdiction over the foreign financial institution.
<br>(5) Waiver
<br>
<br>The President may waive the imposition of sanctions under paragraph (1) for a period of not more than 120 days, and may renew that waiver for additional periods of not more than 120 days, if the President—
<br>
<br>(A) determines that such a waiver is in the national security interest of the United States; and
<br>
<br>(B) submits to Congress a report—
<br>
<br>(i) providing a justification for the waiver;
<br>
<br>(ii) certifying that the country with primary jurisdiction over the foreign financial institution otherwise subject to the sanctions faced exceptional circumstances that prevented the country from being able to reduce significantly its purchases of petroleum and petroleum products from Iran; and
<br>
<br>(iii) that includes any concrete cooperation the President has received or expects to receive as a result of the waiver.
<br>(e) Multilateral diplomacy initiative
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The President shall—
<br>
<br>(A) carry out an initiative of multilateral diplomacy to persuade countries purchasing oil from Iran—
<br>
<br>(i) to limit the use by Iran of revenue from purchases of oil to purchases of non-luxury consumers goods from the country purchasing the oil; and
<br>
<br>(ii) to prohibit purchases by Iran of—
<br>
<br>(I) military or dual-use technology, including items—

<br>(aa) in the Annex to the Missile Technology Control Regime Guidelines;
<br>
<br>(bb) in the Annex on Chemicals to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction, done at Paris January 13, 1993, and entered into force April 29, 1997 (commonly known as the "Chemical Weapons Convention");
<br>
<br>(cc) in Part 1 or 2 of the Nuclear Suppliers Group Guidelines; or
<br>
<br>(dd) on a control list of the Wassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies; or
<br>
<br>(II) any other item that could contribute to Iran's conventional, nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons program; and
<br>
<br>(B) conduct outreach to petroleum-producing countries to encourage those countries to increase their output of crude oil to ensure there is a sufficient supply of crude oil from countries other than Iran and to minimize any impact on the price of oil resulting from the imposition of sanctions under this section.
<br>(2) Report required
<br>
<br>Not later than 180 days after December 31, 2011, and every 180 days thereafter, the President shall submit to Congress a report on the efforts of the President to carry out the initiative described in paragraph (1)(A) and conduct the outreach described in paragraph (1)(B) and the results of those efforts.
