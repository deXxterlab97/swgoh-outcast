<br>Giving his daughter a handmaid, named Zelpha. Now when Jacob had gone in to her according to custom, when morning was come he saw it was Lia.
<br>And he said to his father in law: What is it that thou didst mean to do? did not I serve thee for Rachel? why hast thou deceived me?
<br>Laban answered: It is not the custom in this place, to give the younger in marriage first. 27 Make up the week of days of this match: and I will give thee her also, for the service that
<br>thou shalt render me other seven years.
<br>He yielded to his pleasure: and after the week was past, he married Rachel:
<br>To whom her father gave Bala, for her ser- vant.
<br>And having at length obtained the mar- riage he wished for, he preferred the love of the latter before the former, and served with him other seven years.
<br>And the Lord seeing that he despised Lia, opened her womb, but her sister remained bar- ren.
<br>And she conceived and bore a son, and called his name Ruben, saying: The Lord saw my affliction: now my husband will love me.
<br>And again she conceived and bore a son, and said: Because the Lord heard that I was
<br> 
<br>despised, he hath given this also to me: and she called his name Simeon.
<br>And she conceived the third time, and bore another son, and said: Now also my husband will be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons: and therefore she called his name Levi.
<br>The fourth time she conceived and bore a son, and said: Now will I praise the Lord: and for this she called him Juda. And she left bearing.
<br>
<br>Chapter 30
<br>
<br>And Rachel seeing herself without children, en- vied her sister, and said to her husband: Give me children, otherwise I shall die.
<br>And Jacob being angry with her, answered: Am I as God, who hath deprived thee of the fruit of thy womb?
<br>But she said: I have here my servant Bala: go in unto her, that she may bear upon my knees, and I may have children by her.
<br>And she gave him Bala in marriage: who,
<br>When her husband had gone in unto her, conceived and bore a son.
<br>And Rachel said: The Lord hath judged for me, and hath heard my voice, giving me a son; and therefore she called his name Dan.
<br>And again Bala conceived, and bore another, 8 For whom Rachel said: God hath compared me with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she
<br>called him Nephthali.
<br>Lia perceiving that she had left of bearing, gave Zelpha, her handmaid, to her husband.
<br>And when she had conceived, and brought forth a son,
<br>She said: Happily. And therefore called his name Gad.
<br>Zelpha also bore another.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>And Lia said: This is for my happiness: for women will call me blessed. Therefore she called him Aser.
<br>And Ruben going out in the time of the wheat harvest into the field, found mandrakes: which he brought to his mother Lia. And Rachel said: Give me part of thy son’s mandrakes.
<br>She answered: Dost thou think it a small matter, that thou hast taken my husband from me, unless thou take also my son’s mandrakes? Rachel said: He shall sleep with thee this night, for thy son’s mandrakes.
<br>And when Jacob returned at even from the field, Lia went out to meet him, and said: Thou shalt come in unto me, because I have hired thee for my son’s mandrakes. And he slept with her that night.
<br>And God heard her prayers; and she con- ceived: and bore a fifth son:
<br>And said: God hath given me a reward, because I gave my handmaid to my husband. And she called his name Issachar.
<br>And Lia conceived again, and bore the sixth son,
<br>And said: God hath endowed me with a good dowry; this turn also my husband will be with me, because I have borne him six sons: and therefore she called his name Zabulon.
<br>After whom she bore a daughter, named Dina.
<br>The Lord also remembering Rachel, heard her, and opened her womb.
<br>And she conceived, and bore a son, saying: God hath taken away my reproach.
<br>And she called his name Joseph: saying: The Lord give me also another son.
<br>And when Joseph was born, Jacob said to his father in law: Send me away, that I may return into my country, and to my land.
<br> 
<br>Give me my wives, and my children, for whom I have served thee, that I may depart: thou knowest the service that I have rendered thee.
<br>Laban said to him: Let me find favour in thy sight: I have learned, by experience, that God hath blessed me for thy sake.
<br>Appoint thy wages which I shall give thee. 29 But he answered: Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how great thy possession hath
<br>been in my hands.
<br>Thou hadst but little before I came to thee, and now thou art become rich: and the Lord hath blessed thee at my coming. It is reasonable, therefore, that I should now provide also for my own house.
<br>And Laban said: What shall I give thee? But he said: I require nothing; but if thou wilt do what I demand, I will feed and keep thy sheep again.
<br>Go round through all thy flocks, and sepa- rate all the sheep of divers colours, and speckled; and all that is brown and spotted, and of divers colours, as well among the sheep as among the goats, shall be my wages.
<br>And my justice shall answer for me tomor- row before thee, when the time of the bargain shall come; and all that is not of divers colours, and spotted, and brown, as well among the sheep as among the goats, shall accurse me of theft.
<br>And Laban said: I like well what thou de- mandest.
<br>And he separated the same day the she goats, and the sheep, and the he goats, and the rams of divers colours, and spotted; and all the flock of one colour, that is, of white and black fleece, he deliverdd into the hands of his sons.
<br>And he set the space of three days journey betwixt himself and his son in law, who fed the rest of his flock.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>And Jacob took green rods of poplar, and of almond, and of plane trees, and pilled them in part: so when the bark was taken off, in the parts that were pilled, there appeared whiteness: but the parts that were whole, remained green: and by this means the colour was divers.
<br>And he put them in the troughs, where the water was poured out; that when the flocks should come to drink, they might have the rods before their eyes, and in the sight of them might conceive.
<br>And it came to pass, that in the very heat of coition, the sheep beheld the rods, and brought forth spotted, and of divers colours, and speckled.
<br>And Jacob separated the flock, and put the rods in the troughs before the eyes of the rams; and all the white and the black were Laban’s, and the rest were Jacob’s, when the flocks were separated one from the other.
<br>So when the ewes went first to ram, Ja- cob put the rods in the troughs of water before the eyes of the rams, and of the ewes, that they might conceive while they were looking upon them.
<br>But when the later coming was, and the last conceiving, he did not put them. And those that were lateward, became Laban’s; and they of the first time, Jacob’s.
<br>And the man was enriched exceedingly, and he had many flocks, maidservants and menser- vants, camels and asses.
<br>
<br>Chapter 31
<br>But after that he had heard the words of the sons of Laban, saying: Jacob hath taken away all that was our father’s, and being enriched by his substance is become great.
<br> 
<br>And perceiving also, that Laban’s counte- nance was not towards him as yesterday and the other day.
<br>Especially the Lord saying to him: Return into the land of thy fathers and to thy kindred, and I will be with thee.
<br>He sent, and called Rachel and Lia into the field, where he fed the flocks,
<br>And said to them: I see your father’s coun- tenance is not towards me as yesterday and the other day: but the God of my father hath been with me.
<br>And you know that I have served your father to the uttermost of my power.
<br>Yea your father hath also overreached me, and hath changed my wages ten times: and yet God hath not suffered him to hurt me.
<br>If at any time, he said: The speckled shall be thy wages: all the sheep brought forth speckled: but when he said on the contrary: Thou shalt take all the white one for thy wages: all the flocks brought forth white ones.
<br>And God hath taken your father’s sub- stance, and given it to me.
<br>For after the time came of the ewes conceiv- ing, I lifted up my eyes, and saw in my sleep, that the males which leaped upon the females were of divers colours, and spotted, and speckled.
<br>And the angel of God said to me in my sleep: Jacob. And I answered: Here I am.
<br>And he said: Lift up thy eyes, and see that all the males leaping upon the females, are of divers colours, spotted and speckled. For I have seen all that Laban hath done to thee.
<br>I am the God of Bethel, where thou didst anoint the stone, and make a vow to me. Now therefore arise, and go out of this land, and re- turn into thy native country.
<br>And Rachel and Lia answered: Have we any thing left among the goods and inheritance
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>of our father’s house?
<br>Hath he not counted us as strangers, and sold us, and eaten up the price of us?
<br>But God hath taken our father’s riches, and delivered them to us, and to our children: where- fore, do all that God hath commanded thee.
<br>Then Jacob rose up, and having set his children and wives upon camels, went his way.
<br>And he took all his substance, and flocks, and whatsoever he had gotten in Mesopotamia, and went forward to Isaac, his father, to the land of Chanaan.
<br>At that time Laban was gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel stole away her father’s idols.
<br>And Jacob would not confess to his father in law that he was flying away.
<br>And when he was gone, together with all that belonged to him, and having passed the river, was going on towards mount Galaad,
<br>It was told Laban on the third day, that Jacob fled.
<br>And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days; and overtook him in the mount of Galaad.
<br>And he saw in a dream God, saying to him: Take heed thou speak not any thing harshly against Jacob.
<br>Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain: and when he, with his brethren, had overtaken him, he pitched his tent in the same mount of Galaad.
<br>And he said to Jacob: Why hast thou done thus, to carry away, without my knowledge, my daughters as captives taken with the sword?
<br>Why wouldst thou run away privately, and not acquaint me, that I might have brought thee on the way with joy, and with songs, and with timbrels, and with harps?
<br>Thou hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and daughters; thou hast done foolishly; and now
<br> 
<br>indeed,
<br>It is in my power to return thee evil; but the God of your father said to me yesterday: Take heed thou speak not any thing harshly against Jacob.
<br>Suppose thou didst desire to go to thy friends, and hadst a longing after thy father’s house: why hast thou stolen away my gods?
<br>Jacob answered: That I departed unknown to thee, it was for fear lest thou wouldst take away thy daughters by force.
<br>But, whereas, thou chargest me with theft: with whomsoever thou shalt find thy gods, let him be slain before our brethren. Search, and if thou find any of thy things with me, take them away. Now when he said this, he knew not that Rachel had stolen the idols.
<br>So Laban went into the tent of Jacob, and of Lia, and of both the handmaids, and found them not. And when he was entered into Rachel’s tent,
<br>She, in haste, hid the idols under the camel’s furniture, and sat upon them: and when he had searched all the tent, and found nothing, 35 She said: Let not my lord be angry that
<br>I cannot rise up before thee, because it has now happened to me according to the custom of women. So his careful search was in vain.
<br>And Jacob being angry, said in a chiding manner: For what fault of mine, and for what offence on my part hast thou so hotly pursued me,
<br>And searched all my household stuff? What hast thou found of all the substance of thy house? lay it here before my brethren, and thy brethren, and let them judge between me and thee.
<br>Have I, therefore, been with thee twenty years? thy ewes and goats were not barren, the rams of thy flocks I did not eat:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Neither did I shew thee that which the beast had torn; I made good all the damage: whatsoever was lost by theft, thou didst exact it of me:
<br>Day and night was I parched with heat, and with frost, and sleep departed from my eyes.
<br>And in this manner have I served thee in thy house twenty years, fourteen for thy daugh- ters, and six for thy flocks: thou hast changed also my wages ten times.
<br>Unless the God of my father, Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had stood by me, peradven- ture now thou hadst sent me away naked: God beheld my affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesterday.
<br>Laban answered him: The daughters are mine, and the children, and thy flocks, and all things that thou seest are mine: what can I do to my children, and grandchildren?
<br>Come, therefore, let us enter into a league; that it may be for a testimony between me and thee.
<br>And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a title.
<br>And he said to his brethren: Bring hither stones. And they, gathering stones together, made a heap, and they ate upon it.
<br>And Laban called it, The witness heap; and Jacob, The hillock of testimony: each of them according to the propriety of his language.
<br>And Laban said: This heap shall be a wit- ness between me and thee this day, and therefore the name thereof was called Galaad, that is, The witness heap.
<br>The Lord behold and judge between us, when we shall be gone one from the other.
<br>If thou afflict my daughters, and if thou bring in other wives over them: none is witness of our speech but God, who is present and be- holdeth.
<br> 
<br>And he said again to Jacob: Behold this heap, and the stone which I have set up between me and thee,
<br>Shall be a witness: this heap, I say, and the stone, be they for a testimony, if either I shall pass beyond it going towards thee, or thou shalt pass beyond it thinking harm to me.
<br>The God of Abraham, and the God of Na- chor, the God of their father, judge betweeen us. And Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac: 54 And after he had offered sacrifices in the mountain, he called his brethren to eat bread.
<br>And when they had eaten, they lodged there:
<br>55 But Laban arose in the night, and kissed his sons and daughters, and blessed them: and returned to his place.
<br>
<br>Chapter 32
<br>Jacob also went on the journey he had begun: and the angels of God met him.
<br>And when he saw them, he said: These are the camps of God, and he called the name of that place Mahanaim, that is, Camps.
<br>And he sent messengers before him to Esau, his brother, to the land of Seir, to the country of Edom:
<br>And he commanded them, saying: Thus shall ye speak to my lord Esau: Thus saith thy brother Jacob: I have sojourned with Laban, and have been with him until this day:
<br>I have oxen, and asses, and sheep, and menservants, and womenservants: and now I send a message to my lord, that I may find favour in thy sight.
<br>And the messengers returned to Jacob, say- ing: We came to Esau, thy brother, and behold he cometh with speed to meet thee with four hundred men.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Then Jacob was greatly afraid; and in his fear divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and the sheep, and the oxen, and the camels, into two companies,
<br>Saying: If Esau come to one company, and destroy it, the other company that is left, shall escape.
<br>And Jacob said: O God of my fahter Abra- ham, and God of my father Isaac: O Lord who saidst to me, Return to thy land, and to the place of thy birth, and I will do well for thee.
<br>I am not worthy of the least of all thy mer- cies, and of thy truth which thou hast fulfilled to thy servant. With my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I return with two companies.
<br>Deliver me from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am greatly afraid of him; lest perhaps he come, and kill the mother with the children. 12 Thou didst say, that thou wouldst do well by me, and multiply my seed like the sand of the
<br>sea, which connot be numbered for multitude.
<br>And when he had slept there that night, he set apart, of the things which he had, presents for his brother Esau,
<br>Two hundred she goats, twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,
<br>Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and twenty bulls, twenty she asses, and ten of their foals.
<br>And he sent them by the hands of his ser- vants, every drove by itself, and he said to his servants: Go before me, and let there be a space between drove and drove.
<br>And he commanded the first, saying: If thou meet my brother Esau, and he ask thee: Whose art thou? or whither goest thou? or whose are these before thee?
<br>Thou shalt answer: Thy servant Jacob’s: he hath sent them as a present to my lord Esau; and he cometh after us.
<br> 
<br>In like manner he commanded the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying: Speak ye the same words to Esau, when ye find him.
<br>And ye shall add: Thy servant Jacob him- self also followeth after us; for he said: I will appease him with the presents that go before, and afterwards I will see him, perhaps he will be gracious to me.
<br>So the presents went before him, but him- self lodged that night in the camp.
<br>And rising early, he took his two wives and his two handmaids, with his eleven sons, and passed over the ford of Jaboc.
<br>And when all things were brought over that belonged to him,
<br>He remained alone; and behold, a man wrestled with him till morning.
<br>And when he saw that he could not over- come him, he touched the sinew of his thigh, and forthwith it shrank.
<br>And he said to him: Let me go, for it is break of day.   He answered: I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.
<br>And he said: What is thy name? He an- swered: Jacob.
<br>But he said: Thy name shall not be called Jacob, but Israel; for if thou hast been strong against God, how much more shalt thou prevail against men?
<br>Jacob asked him: Tell me by what name art thou called? He answered: Why dost thou ask my name? And he blessed him in the same place.
<br>And Jacob called the name of the place Phanuel, saying: I have seen God face to face, and my soul has been saved.
<br>And immediately the sun rose upon him, after he was past Phanuel; but he halted on his foot.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Therefore the children of Israel, unto this day, eat not the sinew, that shrank in Jacob’s thigh: because he touched the sinew of his thigh and it shrank.
<br>
<br>Chapter 33
<br>And Jacob lifting up his eyes, saw Esau coming, and with him four hundred men: and he divided the children of Lia and of Rachel, and of the two handmaids.
<br>And he put both the handmaids and their children foremost: and Lia and her children in the second place: and Rachel and Joseph last.
<br>And he went forward and bowed down with his face to the ground seven times, until his brother came near.
<br>Then Esau ran to meet his brother, and em- braced him: and clasping him fast about the neck, and kissing him, wept.
<br>And lifting up his eyes, he saw the women and their children, and said: What mean these? And do they belong to thee? He answered: They are the children which God hath given to me, thy servant.
<br>Then the handmaids and their children came near and bowed themselves.
<br>Lia also, with her children, came near and bowed down in like manner; and last of all, Joseph and Rachel bowed down.
<br>And Esau said: What are the droves that I met? He answered: That I might find favour before my lord.
<br>But he said: I have plenty, my brother, keep what is thine for thyself.
<br>And Jacob said: Do not so I beseech thee, but if I have found favour in thy eyes, receive a little present at my hands: for I have seen thy face, as if I should have seen the countenance of
<br> 
<br>God: be gracious to me,
<br>And take the blessing which I have brought thee, and which God hath given me, who giveth all things. He took it with much ado at his brother’s earnest pressing him,
<br>And said: Let us go on together, and I will accompany thee in thy journey.
<br>And Jacob said: My lord, thou knowest that I have with me tender children, and sheep, and kine with young: which if I should cause to be overdriven, in one day all the flocks will die.
<br>14 May it please my lord to go before his ser- vant: and I will follow softly after him, as I shall see my children to be able, until I come to my lord in Seir.
<br>Esau answered: I beseech thee, that some of the people, at least, who are with me, may stay to accompany thee in the way. And he said: There is no necessity: I want nothing else but only to find favour, my lord, in thy sight.
<br>So Esau returned that day, the way that he came, to Seir.
<br>And Jacob came to Socoth: where having built a house, and pitched tents, he called the name of the place Socoth, that is, Tents.
<br>And he passed over to Salem, a city of the Sichemites, which is in the land of Chanaan, af- ter he returned from Mesopotamia of Syria: and he dwelt by the town.
<br>And he bought that part of the field, in which he pitched his tents, of the children of Hemor, the father of Sichem, for a hundred lambs.
<br>And raising an altar there, he invoked upon it the most mighty God of Israel.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 34
<br>And Dina the daughter of Lia went out to see the women of that country.
<br>And when Sichem the son of Hemor the Hevite, the prince of that land, saw her, he was in love with her: and took her away, and lay with her, ravishing the virgin.
<br>And his soul was fast knit unto her; and whereas she was sad, he comforted her with sweet words.
<br>And going to Hemor his father, he said: Get me this damsel to wife.
<br>But when Jacob had heard this, his sons being absent, and employed in feeding the cattle, he held his peace till they came back.
<br>And when Hemor the father of Sichem was come out to speak to Jacob,
<br>Behold his sons came from the field: and hearing what had passed, they were exceeding angry, because he had done a foul thing in Israel, and committed an unlawful act, in ravishing Ja- cob’s daughter.
<br>And Hemor spoke to them: The soul of my son Sichem has a longing for your daughter: give her him to wife:
<br>And let us contract marriages one with an- other: give us your daughters, and take you our daughters.
<br>And dwell with us: the land is at your command, till, trade, and possess it.
<br>Sichem also said to her father and to her brethren: Let me find favour in your sight, and whatsoever you shall appoint I will give:
<br>Raise the dowry, and ask gifts, and I will gladly give what you shall demand: only give me this damsel to wife.
<br>The sons of Jacob answered Sichem and his father deceitfully, being enraged at the deflower- ing of their sister:
<br> 
<br>We cannot do what you demand, nor give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; which with us is unlawful and abominable.
<br>But in this we may be allied with you, if you will be like us, and all the male sex among you be circumcised:
<br>Then will we mutually give and take your daughters, and ours; and we will dwell with you, and will be one people:
<br>But if you will not be circumcised, we will take our daughter and depart.
<br>Their offer pleased Hemor, and Sichem, his son:
<br>And the young man made no delay, but forthwith fulfilled what was required: for he loved the damsel exceedingly, and he was the greatest man in all his father’s house.
<br>And going into the gate of the city, they spoke to the people:
<br>These men are peaceable, and are willing to dwell with us: let them trade in the land, and till it, which being large and wide wanteth men to till it: we shall take their daughters for wives, and we will give them ours.
<br>One thing there is for which so great a good is deferred: We must circumcise every male among us, following the manner of the nation.
<br>And their substance, and cattle, and all that they possess, shall be ours; only in this let us condescend, and by dwelling together, we shall make one people.
<br>And they all agreed, and circumcised all the males.
<br>And behold the third day, when the pain of the wound was greatest: two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, the brothers of Dina, taking their swords, entered boldly into the city and slew all the men.
<br>And they killed also Hemor and Sichem, and took away their sister Dina out of Sichem’s
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>house.
<br>And when they were gone out, the other sons of Jacob came upon the slain; and plun- dered the city in revenge of the rape.
<br>And they took their sheep, and their herds, and their asses, wasting all they had in their houses and in their fields.
<br>And their children and wives they took captive.
<br>And when they had boldly perpetrated these things, Jacob said to Simeon and Levi: You have troubled me, and made me hateful to the Chanaanites and Pherezites, the inhabitants of this land. We are few: they will gather them- selves together and kill me; and both I, and my house shall be destroyed.
<br>They answered: Should they abuse our sis- ter as a strumpet?
<br>
<br>Chapter 35
<br>In the mean time God said to Jacob: Arise and go up to Bethel, and dwell there, and make there an altar to God, who appeared to thee when thou didst flee from Esau, thy brother.
<br>And Jacob having called together all his household, said: Cast away the strange gods that are among you, and be cleansed, and change your garments.
<br>Arise, and let us go up to Bethel, that we may make there an altar to God; who heard me in the day of my affliction, and accompained me in my journey.
<br>So they gave him all the strange gods they had, and the earrings which were in their ears: and he buried them under the turpentine tree, that is behind the city of Sichem.
<br>And when they were departed, the terror of God fell upon all the cities round about, and
<br> 
<br>they durst not pursue after them as they went away.
<br>And Jacob came to Luza, which is in the land of Chanaan, surnamed Bethel: he and all the people that were with him.
<br>And he built there an altar, and called the name of that place, The house of God: for there God appeared to him when he fled from his brother.
<br>At the same time Debora, the nurse of Re- becca, died, and was buried at the foot of Bethel, under an oak, and the name of that place was called, The oak of weeping.
<br>And God appeared again to Jacob, after he returned from Mesopotamia of Syria, and he blessed him,
<br>Saying: Thou shalt not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name. And he called him Israel.
<br>And said to him: I am God almighty, in- crease thou and be multiplied. Nations and peo- ples of nations shall be from thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins.
<br>And the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I will give to thee, and to thy seed after thee.
<br>And he departed from him.
<br>But he set up a monument of stone, in the place where God had spoken to him: pouring drink fferings upon it, and pouring oil thereon:
<br>And calling the name of that place Bethel. 16 And going forth from thence, he came in the spring time to the land which leadeth to
<br>Ephrata: wherein when Rachel was in travail,
<br>By reason of her hard labour, she began to be in danger, and the midwife said to her: Fear not, for thou shalt have this son also.
<br>And when her soul was departing for pain, and death was now at hand, she called the name of her son Benoni, that is, the son of my pain:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>but his father called him Benjamin, that is, the son of the right hand.
<br>So Rachel died, and was buried in the high- way that leadeth to Ephrata, this is Bethlehem. 20 And Jacob erected a pillar over her sepul- chre: this is the pillar of Rachel’s monument, to
<br>this day.
<br>Departing thence, he pitched his tent be- yond the Flock tower.
<br>And when he dwelt in that country, Ruben went, and slept with Bala the concubine of his father: which he was not ignorant of. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve.
<br>The sons of Lia: Ruben the first born, and Simeon, and Levi, and Juda, and Issachar, and Zabulon.
<br>The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.
<br>The sons of Bala, Rachel’s handmaid: Dan and Nephthali.
<br>The sons of Zelpha, Lia’s handmaid: Gad and Aser: these are the sons of Jacob, that were born to him in Mesopotamia of Syria.
<br>And he came to Isaac his father in Mam- bre, the city of Arbee, this is Hebron: wherein Abraham and Isaac sojourned.
<br>And the days of Isaac were a hundred and eighty years.
<br>And being spent with age he died, and was gathered to his people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
<br>
<br>Chapter 36
<br>And these are the generations of Esau, the same is Edom.
<br>2 Esau took wives of the daughters of Chanaan: Ada the daughter of Elon the Hethite, and Oolibama the daughter of Ana, the daughter of Sebeon the Hevite:
<br> 
<br>And Basemath, the daughter of Ismael, sis- ter of Nabajoth.
<br>And Ada bore Eliphaz: Basemath bore Rahuel.
<br>Oolibama bore Jehus, and Ihelon, and Core. These are the sons of Esau, that were born to him in the land of Chanaan.
<br>And Esau took his wives, and his sons and daughters, and every soul of his house, and his substance, and cattle, and all that he was able to acquire in the land of Chanaan: and went into another country, and departed from his brother Jacob.
<br>For they were exceeding rich, and could not dwell together: neither was the land in which they sojourned able to bear them, for the multi- tude of their flocks.
<br>And Esau dwelt in mount Seir: he is Edom.
<br>And these are the generations of Esau, the father of Edom, in mount Seir.
<br>And these the names of his sons: Eliphaz the son of Ada, the wife of Esau: and Rahuel, the son of Basemath, his wife.
<br>And Eliphaz had sons: Theman, Omar, Sepho, and Gatham and Cenez.
<br>And Thamna was the concubine of Eliphaz, the son of Esau: and she bore him Amalech. These are the sons of Ada, the wife of Esau.
<br>And the sons of Rahuel were Nahath and Zara, Samma and Meza. These were the sons of Basemath, the wife of Esau.
<br>And these were the sons of Oolibama, the daughter of Ana, the daughter of Sebeon, the wife of Esau, whom she bore to him, Jehus, and Ihelon, and Core.
<br>These were dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz, the firstborn of Esau: duke The- man, duke Omar, duke Sepho, duke Cenez,
<br>Duke Core, duke Gatham, duke Amalech: these are the sons of Eliphaz, in the land of
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Edom, and these the sons of Ada.
<br>And these were the sons of Rahuel, the son of Esau: duke Nahath, duke Zara, duke Samma, duke Meza. And these are the dukes of Rahuel, in the land of Edom: these the sons of Basemath, the wife of Esau.
<br>And these the sons of Oolibama, the wife of Esau: duke Jehus, duke Ihelon, duke Core. These are the dukes of Oolibama, the daughter of Ana, and wife of Esau.
<br>These are the sons of Esau, and these the dukes of them: the same is Edom.
<br>These are the sons of Seir, the Horrite, the inhabitants of the land: Lotan, and Sobal, and Sebeon, and Ana,
<br>And Dison, and Eser, and Disan. These are dukes of the Horrites, the sons of Seir, in the land of Edom.
<br>And Lotan had sons:   Hori and Heman.
<br>And the sister of Lotan was Thamna.
<br>And these the sons of Sobal: Alvan, and Manahat, and Ebal, and Sepho, and Onam.
<br>And these the sons of Sebeon: Aia and Ana. This is Ana that found the hot waters in the wilderness, when he fed the asses of Sebeon, his father:
<br>And he had a son Dison, and a daughter Oolibama.
<br>And these were the sons of Dison: Hamdan, and Eseban, and Jethram, and Charan.
<br>These also were the sons of Eser: Balaan, and Zavan, and Acan.
<br>And Dison had sons: Hus and Aram.
<br>These were dukes of the Horrites: duke Lotan, duke Sobal, duke Sebeon, duke Ana,
<br>Duke Dison, duke Eser, duke Disan: these were dukes of the Horrites that ruled in the land of Seir.
<br>And the kings that ruled in the land of Edom, before the children of Israel had a king,
<br> 
<br>were these:
<br>Bela the son of Beor, and the name of his city Denaba.
<br>And Bela died, and Jobab, the son of Zara, of Bosra, reigned in his stead.
<br>And when Jobab was dead, Husam, of the land of the Themanites, reigned in his stead.
<br>And after his death, Adad, the son of Badad, reigned in his stead, who defeated the Madianites in the country of Boab; and the name of his city was Avith.
<br>And when Adad was dead, there reigned in his stead, Semla, of Masreca.
<br>And he being dead, Saul, of the river Ro- hoboth, reigned in his stead.
<br>And when he also was dead, Balanan, the son of Achobor, succeeded to the kingdom.
<br>This man also being dead, Adar reigned in his place; and the name of his city was Phau: and his wife was called Meetabel, the daughter of Matred, daughter of Mezaab.
<br>And these are the names of the dukes of Esau in their kindreds, and places, and callings: duke Thamna, duke Alva, duke Jetheth,
<br>Duke Oolibama, duke Ela, duke Phinon, 42 Duke Cenez, duke Theman, duke Mabsar, 43 Duke Magdiel, duke Hiram: these are the
<br>dukes of Edom dwelling in the land of their gov- ernment; the same is Esau, the father of the Edomites.
<br>
<br>Chapter 37
<br>And Jacob dwelt in the land of Chanaan, wherein his father sojourned.
<br>2 And these are his generations: Joseph, when he was sixteen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren, being but a boy: and he was with the sons of Bala and of Zelpha his father’s
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>wives: and he accused his brethren to his father of a most wicked crime.
<br>3	Now Israel loved Joseph above all his sons, because he had him in his old age: and he made him a coat of divers colours.
<br>4	And his brethren seeing that he was loved by his father, more than all his sons, hated hem, and could not speak peaceably to him.
<br>5	Now it fell out also that he told his brethren a dream, that he had dreamed: which occasioned them to hate him the more.
<br>6	And he said to them: Hear my dream which I dreamed.
<br>7	I thought we were binding sheaves in the field: and my sheaf arose as it were, and stood, and your sheaves standing about bowed down before my sheaf.
<br>8	His brethren answered: Shalt thou be our king? or shall we be subject to thy dominion? Therefore this matter of his dreams and words ministered nourishment to their envy and ha- tred.
<br>9	He dreamed also another dream, which he told his brethren, saying: I saw in a dream, as it were the sun, and the moon, and eleven stars worshipping me.
<br>10	And when he had told this to his fa- ther, and brethren, his father rebuked him and said: What meaneth this dream that thou hast dreamed? shall I and thy mother, and thy brethren worship thee upon the earth?
<br>11	His brethren therefore envied him: but his father considered the thing with himself.
<br>12	And when his brethren abode in Sechem, feeding their father’s flocks,
<br>13	Israel said to him: Thy brethren feed the sheep in Sichem: come, I will send thee to them. And when he answered:
<br>14	I am ready: he said to him: Go, and see if all things be well with thy brethren, and the
<br> 
<br>cattle: and bring me word again what is doing. So being sent from the vale of Hebron, he came to Sichem:
<br>15	And a man found him there wandering in the field, and asked what he sought.
<br>16	But he answered: I seek my brethren, tell me where they feed the flocks.
<br>17	And the man said to him: They are de- parted from this place: for I heard them say: Let us go to Dothain. And Joseph went forward after his brethren, and found them in Dothain.
<br>18	And when they saw him afar off, before he came nigh them, they thought to kill him:
<br>19	And said one to another: Behold the dreamer cometh.
<br>20	Come, let us kill him, and cast him into some old pit: and we will say: Some evil beast hath devoured him: and then it shall appear what his dreams avail him:
<br>21	And Ruben hearing this, endeavoured to deliver him out of their hands, and said:
<br>22	Do not take away his life, nor shed his blood: but cast him into this pit, that is in the wilderness, and keep your hands harmless: now he said this, being desirous to deliver him out of their hands and to restore him to his father.
<br>23	And as soon as he came to his brethren, they forthwith stript him of his outside coat, that was of divers colours:
<br>24	And cast him into an old pit where there was not water.
<br>25	And sitting down to eat bread,   they saw some Ismaelites on their way coming from Galaad, with their camels, carrying spices, and balm, and myrrh to Egypt.
<br>26	And Juda said to his brethren: What will it profit us to kill our brother, and conceal his blood?
<br>27	It is better that he be sold to the Ismaelites, and that our hands be not defiled: for he is our
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>brother and our flesh. His brethren agreed to his words.
<br>28	And when the Madianite merchants passed by, they drew him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ismaelites, for twenty pieces of silver: and they led him into Egypt.
<br>29	And Ruben returning to the pit, found not the boy:
<br>30	And rending his garments he went to his brethren, and said: The boy doth not appear, and whither shall I go?
<br>31	And they took his coat, and dipped it in the blood of a kid, which they had killed:
<br>32	Sending some to carry it to their father, and to say: This we have found: see whether it be thy son’s coat, or not.
<br>33	And the father acknowledging it, said: It is my son’s coat, an evil wild beast hath eaten him, a beast hath devoured Joseph.
<br>34	And tearing his garments, he put on sack- cloth, mourning for his son a long time.
<br>35	And all his children being gathered to- gether to comfort their father in his sorrow, he would not receive comfort, but said: I will go down to my son into hell, mourning. And whilst he continued weeping,
<br>36	The Madianites sold Joseph in Egypt to Putiphar, an eunuch of Pharao, captain of the soldiers.
<br>
<br>Chapter 38
<br>
<br>At that time Juda went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Odollamite, named Hiras.
<br>And he saw there the daughter of a man of Chanaan, called Sue: and taking her to wife, he went in unto her.
<br> 
<br>And she conceived, and bore a son, and called his name Her.
<br>And conceiving again, she bore a son, and called him Onan.
<br>She bore also a third: whom she called Sela. After whose birth, she ceased to bear any more. 6 And Juda took a wife for Her, his first born,
<br>whose name was Thamar.
<br>And Her, the first born of Juda, was wicked in the sight of the Lord: and was slain by him.
<br>Juda, therefore, said to Onan his son: Go in to thy brother’s wife and marry her, that thou mayst raise seed to thy brother.
<br>He knowing that the children should not be his, when he went in to his brother’s wife, he spilled his seed upon the ground, lest children should be born in his brother’s name.
<br>And therefore the Lord slew him, because he did a detestable thing:
<br>Wherefore Juda said to Thamar his daughter-in-law: Remain a widow in thy father’s house, till Sela my son grow up: for he was afraid lest he also might die, as his brethren did. She went her way, and dwelt in her father’s house.
<br>And after many days were past: the daugh- ter of Sue the wife of Juda died: and when he had taken comfort after his mourning, he went up to Thamnas, to the shearers of his sheep, he and Hiras the Odollamite, the shepherd of his flock.
<br>And it was told Thamar that her father-in- law was come up to Thamnas to shear his sheep. 14 And she put off the garments of her widow- hood, and took a veil: and changing her dress, sat in the cross way, that leadeth to Thamnas: because Sela was grown up, and she had not been
<br>married to him.
<br>15 When Juda saw her, he thought she was a harlot: for she had covered her face, lest she should be known.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>16	And going to her, he said: Suffer me to lie with thee: for he knew her not to be his daughter-in-law. And she answered: What wilt thou give me to enjoy my company?
<br>17	He said: I will send thee a kid out of the flock. And when she said again: I will suffer what thou wilt, if thou give me a pledge, till thou send what thou promisest.
<br>18	Juda said: What wilt thou have for a pledge? She answered: Thy ring and bracelet, and the staff which thou holdest in thy hand. The woman therefore at one copulation con- ceived.
<br>19	And she arose and went her way: and putting off the apparel which she had taken, put on the garments of her widowhood.
<br>20	And Juda sent a kid by his shepherd, the Odollamite, that he might receive the pledge again, which he had given to the woman: but he, not finding her,
<br>21	Asked the men of that place: Where is the woman that sat in the cross way? And when they all made answer: There was no harlot in this place,
<br>22	He returned to Juda, and said to him: I have not found her; moreover, the men of that place said to me, that there never sat a harlot there.
<br>23	Juda said: Let her take it to herself, surely she cannot charge us with a lie, I sent the kid which I promised: and thou didst not find her.
<br>24	And behold, after three months, they told Juda, saying: Thamar, thy daughter-in-law, hath played the harlot, and she appeareth to have a big belly. And Juda said: Bring her out that she may be burnt.
<br>25	But when she was led to execution, she sent to her father in law, saying: By the man, to whom these things belong, I am with child. See whose ring, and bracelet, and staff this is.
<br> 
<br>26	But he acknowledging the gifts, said: She is juster than I: because I did not give her to Sela, my son. However he knew her no more.
<br>27	And when she was ready to be brought to bed, there appeared twins in her womb: and in the very delivery of the infants, one put forth a hand, whereon the midwife tied a scarlet thread, saying:
<br>28	This shall come forth the first.
<br>29	But he drawing back his hand, the other came forth: and the woman said: Why is the partition divided for thee? and therefore called his name Phares.
<br>30	Afterwards his brother came out, on whose hand was the scarlet thread: and she called his name Zara.
<br>
<br>Chapter 39
<br>And Joseph was brought into Egypt, and Putiphar, an eunuch of Pharao, chief captain of the army, an Egyptian, bought him of the Is- maelites, by whom he was brought.
<br>And the Lord was with him, and he was a prosperous man in all things: and he dwelt in his master’s house:
<br>Who knew very well that the Lord was with him, and made all that he did to prosper in his hand.
<br>And Joseph found favour in the sight of his master, and ministered to him: and being set over all by him, he governed the house commit- ted to him, and all things that were delivered to him:
<br>And the Lord blessed the house of the Egyp- tian for Joseph’s sake, and multiplied all his sub- stance, both at home and in the fields.
<br>Neither knew he any other thing, but the bread which he ate. And Joseph was of a beau-
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>tiful countenance, and comely to behold.
<br>And after many days, his mistress cast her eyes on Joseph, and said: Lie with me.
<br>But he in no wise consenting to that wicked act said to her: Behold, my master hath deliv- ered all things to me, and knoweth not what he hath in his own house:
<br>Neither is there any thing which is not in my power, or that he hath not delivered to me, but thee, who art his wife; how then can I do this wicked thing, and sin against my God?
<br>With such words as these day by day, both the woman was importunate with the young man, and he refused the adultery.
<br>Now it happened on a certain day, that Joseph went into the house, and was doing some business, without any man with him:
<br>And she catching the skirt of his garment, said: Lie with me. But he leaving the garment in her hand, fled, and went out.
<br>And when the woman saw the garment in her hands, and herself disregarded,
<br>She called to her the men of her house, and said to them: See, he hath brought in a Hebrew, to abuse us: he came in to me, to lie with me; and when I cried out,
<br>And he heard my voice, he left the garment that I held, and got him out.
<br>For a proof therefore of her fidelity, she kept the garment, and shewed it to her husband when he returned home:
<br>And said: The Hebrew servant, whom thou hast brought, came to me to abuse me.
<br>And when he heard me cry, he left the gar- ment which I held, and fled out.
<br>His master hearing these things, and giving too much credit to his wife’s words, was very angry,
<br>And cast Joseph into the prison, where the king’s prisoners were kept, and he was there shut
<br> 
<br>up.
<br>But the Lord was with Joseph, and having mercy upon him gave him favour in the sight of the chief keeper of the prison:
<br>Who delivered into his hand all the prison- ers that were kept in custody: and whatsoever was done, was under him.
<br>Neither did he himself know any thing, hav- ing committed all things to him: for the Lord was with him, and made all that he did to pros- per.
<br>
<br>Chapter 40
<br>After this, it came to pass, that two eunuchs, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, offended their lord.
<br>2 And Pharao being angry with them, (now the one was chief butler, the other chief baker,) 3 He sent them to the prison of the commander of the soldiers, in which Joseph also was prisoner. 4 But the keeper of the prison delivered them to Joseph, and he served them. Some little time
<br>passed, and they were kept in custody.
<br>And they both dreamed a dream the same night, according to the interpretation agreeing to themselves:
<br>And when Joseph was come into them in the morning, and saw them sad,
<br>He asked them, saying: Why is your coun- tenance sadder today than usual?
<br>They answered: We have dreamed a dream, and there is nobody to interpret it to us. And Joseph said to them: Doth not interpretation belong to God? Tell me what you have dreamed: 9 The chief butler first told his dream: I saw
<br>before me a vine,
<br>10 On which were three branches, which by little and little sent out buds, and after the blos-
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>soms brought forth ripe grapes:
<br>11 And the cup of Pharao was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into the cup which I held, and I gave the cup to Pharao. 12 Joseph answered: This is the interpretation of the dream: The three branches, are yet three
<br>days:
<br>After which Pharao will remember thy ser- vice, and will restore thee to thy former place: and thou shalt present him the cup according to thy office, as before thou was wont to do.
<br>Only remember me when it shall be well with thee, and do me this kindness: to put Pharao in mind to take me out of this prison:
<br>For I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews, and here without any fault was cast into the dungeon.
<br>The chief baker seeing that he had wisely interpreted the dream, said: I also dreamed a dream, That I had three baskets of meal upon my head:
<br>And that in one basket which was upper- most, I carried all meats that are made by the art of baking, and that the birds ate out of it.
<br>Joseph answered: This is the interpretation of the dream: The three baskets, are yet three days:
<br>After which Pharao will take thy head from thee, and hang thee on a cross, and the birds shall tear thy flesh.
<br>The third day after this was the birthday of Pharao: and he made a great feast for his servants, and at the banquet remembered the chief butler, and the chief baker.
<br>And he restored the one to his place, to present him the cup:
<br>The other he hanged on a gibbet, that the truth of the interpreter might be shewn.
<br>But the chief butler, when things prospered with him, forgot his interpreter.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 41
<br>
<br>After two years Pharao had a dream. He thought he stood by the river,
<br>Out of which came up seven kine, very beau- tiful and fat: and they fed in marshy places.
<br>Other seven also came up out of the river, ill favoured, and lean fleshed: and they fed on the very bank of the river, in green places:
<br>And they devoured them, whose bodies were very beautiful and well conditioned. So Pharao awoke.
<br>He slept again, and dreamed another dream: Seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk full and fair:
<br>Then seven other ears sprung up thin and blasted,
<br>And devoured all the beauty of the former.
<br>Pharao awaked after his rest:
<br>And when morning was come, being struck with fear, he sent to all the interpreters of Egypt, and to all the wise men: and they being called for, he told them his dream, and there was not any one that could interpret it.
<br>Then at length the chief butler remember- ing, said: I confess my sin:
<br>The king being angry with his servants, commanded me and the chief baker to be cast into the prison of the captain of the soldiers.
<br>Where in one night both of us dreamed a dream forboding things to come.
<br>There was there a young man a Hebrew, servant to the same captain of the soldiers: to whom we told our dreams,
<br>And we heard what afterwards the event of the thing proved to be so. For I was restored to my office: and he was hanged upon a gibbet. 14 Forthwith at the king’s command Joseph was brought out of the prison, and they shaved
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>him: and changing his apparel brought him in to him.
<br>And he said to him: I have dreamed dreams, and there is no one that can expound them: Now I have heard that thou art very wise at interpreting them:
<br>Joseph answered: Without me, God shall give Pharao a prosperous answer.
<br>So Pharao told what he had dreamed: Methought I stood upon the bank of the river,
<br>And seven kine came up out of the river, exceeding beautiful and full of flesh: and they grazed on green places in a marshy pasture.
<br>And behold, there followed these, other seven kine,  so very ill favoured and lean,  that I never saw the like in the land of Egypt:
<br>And they devoured and consumed the for- mer,
<br>And yet gave no mark of their being full: but were as lean and ill favoured as before. I awoke, and then fell asleep again,
<br>And dreamed a dream: Seven ears of corn grew up upon one stalk, full and very fair.
<br>Other seven also thin and blasted, sprung of the stalk:
<br>And they devoured the beauty of the for- mer: I told this dream to the conjecturers, and there is no man that can expound it.
<br>Joseph answered: The king’s dream is one: God hath shewn to Pharao what he is about to do.
<br>The seven beautiful kine, and the seven full ears, are seven years of plenty: and both contain the same meaning of the dream.
<br>And the seven lean and thin kine that came up after them, and the seven thin ears that were blasted with the burning wind, are seven years of famine to come:
<br>Which shall be fulfilled in this order.
<br> 
<br>Behold, there shall come seven years of great plenty in the whole land of Egypt:
<br>After which shall follow other seven years of so great scarcity, that all the abundance before shall be forgotten: for the famine shall consume all the land,
<br>And the greatness of the scarcity shall de- stroy the greatness of the plenty.
<br>And for that thou didst see the second time a dream pertaining to the same thing: it is a token of the certainty, and that the word of God cometh to pass, and is fulfilled speedily.
<br>Now therefore let the king provide a wise and industrious man, and make him ruler over the land of Egypt:
<br>That he may appoint overseers over all the countries: and gather into barns the fifth part of the fruits, during the seven fruitful years,
<br>That shall now presently ensue: and let all the corn be laid up, under Pharao’s hands, and be reserved in the cities.
<br>And let it be in readiness, against the famine of seven years to come, which shall op- press Egypt, and the land shall not be consumed with scarcity.
<br>The counsel pleased Pharao, and all his servants.
<br>And he said to them: Can we find such another man, that is full of the spirit of God?
<br>He said therefore to Joseph: Seeing God hath shewn thee all that thou hast said, can I find one wiser and one like unto thee?
<br>Thou shalt be over my house, and at the commandment of thy mouth all the people shall obey: only in the kingly throne will I be above thee.
<br>And again Pharao said to Joseph: Behold, I have appointed thee over the whole land of Egypt.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>And he took his ring from his own hand, and gave it into his hand: and he put upon him a robe of silk, and put a chain of gold about his neck.
<br>And he made him go up into his second chariot, the crier proclaiming that all should bow their knee before him, and that they should know he was made governor over the whole land of Egypt.
<br>And the king said to Joseph: I am Pharao: without thy commandment no man shall move hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.
<br>And he turned his name, and called him in the Egyptian tongue the saviour of the world. And he gave him to wife Aseneth, the daughter of Putiphare, priest of Heliopolis. Then Joseph went out to the land of Egypt.
<br>(Now he was thirty years old when he stood before king Pharao), and he went round all the countries of Egypt.
<br>And the fruitfulness of the seven years came: and the corn being bound up into sheaves, was gathered together into the barns of Egypt.
<br>And all the abundance of grain was laid up in every city.
<br>And there was so great abundance of wheat, that it was equal to the sand of the sea, and the plenty exceeded measure.
<br>And before the famine came, Joseph had two sons born: whom Aseneth, the daughter of Putiphare, priest of Heliopolis, bore unto him.
<br>And he called the name of the firstborn Manasses, saying: God hath made me to forget all my labours, and my father’s house.
<br>And he named the second Ephraim, saying: God hath made me to grow in the land of my poverty.
<br>Now when the seven years of plenty that had been in Egypt were passed:
<br>The seven years of scarcity, which Joseph
<br> 
<br>had foretold, began to come: and the famine prevailed in the whole world, but there was bread in all the land of Egypt.
<br>And when there also they began to be fam- ished, the people cried to Pharao, for food. And he said to them: Go to Joseph: and do all that he shall say to you.
<br>And the famine increased daily in all the land: and Joseph opened all the barns, and sold to the Egyptians: for the famine had oppressed them also.
<br>And all provinces came into Egypt, to buy food, and to seek some relief of their want.
<br>
<br>Chapter 42
<br>And Jacob hearing that food was sold in Egypt, said to his sons: Why are ye careless?
<br>I have heard that wheat is sold in Egypt: Go ye down, and buy us necessaries, that we may live, and not be consumed with want.
<br>So the ten brethren of Joseph went down, to buy corn in Egypt:
<br>Whilst Benjamin was kept at home by Ja- cob, who said to his brethren: Lest perhaps he take any harm in the journey.
<br>And they entered into the land of Egypt with others that went to buy. For the famine was in the land of Chanaan.
<br>And Joseph was governor in the land of Egypt, and corn was sold by his direction to the people. And when his brethren had bowed down to him,
<br>And he knew them, he spoke as it were to strangers, somewhat roughly, asking them: Whence came you? They answered: From the land of Chanaan, to buy necessaries of life.
<br>And though he knew his brethren, he was not known by them.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>And remembering the dreams, which for- merly he had dreamed, he said to them: You are spies. You are come to view the weaker parts of the land.
<br>But they said: It is not so, my lord; but thy servants are come to buy food.
<br>We are all the sons of one man: we are come as peaceable men, neither do thy servants go about any evil.
<br>And he answered them: It is otherwise: you are come to consider the unfenced parts of this land.
<br>But they said: We thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Chanaan: the youngest is with our father, the other is not living.
<br>He saith, This is it that I said: You are spies.
<br>I shall now presently try what you are: by the health of Pharao, you shall not depart hence, until your youngest brother come.
<br>Send one of you to fetch him: and you shall be in prison, till what you have said be proved, whether it be true or false: or else by the health of Pharao you are spies.
<br>So he put them in prison three days.
<br>And the third day he brought them out of prison, and said: Do as I have said, and you shall live: for I fear God.
<br>If you be peaceable men, let one of your brethren be bound in prison:  and go ye your ways, and carry the corn that you have bought, unto your houses.
<br>And bring your youngest brother to me, that I may find your words to be true, and you may not die.  They did as he had said.
<br>And they talked one to another: We de- serve to suffer these things, because we have sinned against our brother, seeing the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would
<br> 
<br>not hear: therefore is this affliction come upon us.
<br>And Ruben, one of them, said: Did not I say to you: Do not sin against the boy; and you would not hear me? Behold his blood is required.
<br>And they knew not that Joseph under- stood, because he spoke to them by an inter- preter.
<br>And he turned himself away a little while, and wept: and returning, he spoke to them.
<br>And taking Simeon, and binding him in their presence, he commanded his servants to fill their sacks with wheat, and to put every man’s money again in their sacks, and to give them besides provisions for the way: and they did so. 26 But they having loaded their asses with the
<br>corn went their way.
<br>And one of them opening his sack, to give his beast provender in the inn, saw the money in the sack’s mouth,
<br>And said to his brethren: My money is given me again; behold it is in the sack. And they were astonished, and troubled, and said to one another: What is this that God hath done unto us?
<br>And they came to Jacob their father in the land of Chanaan, and they told him all things that had befallen them, saying:
<br>The lord of the land spoke roughly to us, and took us to be spies of the country.
<br>And we answered him: We are peaceable men, and we mean no plot.
<br>We are twelve brethren born of one father: one is not living, the youngest is with our father in the land of Chanaan.
<br>And he said to us: Hereby shall I know that you are peaceable men: Leave one of your brethren with me, and take ye necessary provi- sion for your houses, and go your ways,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>And bring your youngest brother to me, that I may know you are not spies: and you may receive this man again, that is kept in prison: and afterwards may have leave to buy what you will.
<br>When they had told this, they poured out their corn, and every man found his money tied in the mouth of his sack: and all being aston- ished together,
<br>Their father Jacob said: You have made me to be without children: Joseph is not living, Simeon is kept in bonds, and Benjamin you will take away: all these evils are fallen upon me.
<br>And Ruben answered him: Kill my two sons, if I bring him not again to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will restore him to thee. 38 But he said: My son shall not go down with you: his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if any mischief befall him in the land to which you go, you will bring down my grey hairs with
<br>sorrow to hell.
<br>
<br>Chapter 43
<br>In the mean time the famine was heavy upon all the land.
<br>And when they had eaten up all the corn, which they had brought out of Egypt, Jacob said to his sons: Go again, and buy us a little food.
<br>Juda answered: The man declared unto us with the attestation of an oath, saying: You shall not see my face, unless you bring your youngest brother with you.
<br>If therefore thou wilt send him with us, we will set out together, and will buy necessaries for thee.
<br>But if thou wilt not, we will not go: for the man, as we have often said, declared unto us, saying: You shall not see my face without your
<br> 
<br>youngest brother.
<br>Israel said to them: You have done this for my misery, in that you told him you had also another brother.
<br>But they answered: The man asked us in or- der concerning our kindred: if our father lived: if we had a brother: and we answered him reg- ularly, according to what he demanded: could we know that he would say: Bring hither your brother with you?
<br>And Juda said to his father: Send the boy with me, that we may set forward, and may live: lest both we and our children perish.
<br>I take the boy upon me, require him at my hand: unless I bring him again, and restore him to thee, I will be guilty of sin against thee for ever.
<br>If delay had not been made, we had been here again the second time.
<br>Then Israel said to them: If it must needs be so, do what you will: take of the best fruits of the land in your vessels, and carry down presents to the man, a little balm, and honey, and storax, myrrh, turpentine, and almonds.
<br>And take with you double money, and carry back what you found in your sacks, lest perhaps it was done by mistake.
<br>And take also your brother, and go to the man.
<br>And may my almighty God make him favourable to you: and send back with you your brother, whom he keepeth, and this Benjamin: and as for me I shall be desolate without chil- dren.
<br>So the men took the presents, and dou- ble money, and Benjamin: and went down into Egypt, and stood before Joseph.
<br>And when he had seen them, and Benjamin with them, he commanded the steward of his house, saying: Bring in the men into the house,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>and kill victims, and prepare a feast: because they shall eat with me at noon.
<br>He did as he was commanded, and brought the men into the house.
<br>And they being much afraid, said there one to another: Because of the money, which we carried back the first time in our sacks, we are brought in: that he may bring upon us a false accusation, and by violence make slaves of us and our asses.
<br>Wherefore, going up to the steward of the house, at the door,
<br>They said: Sir, we desire thee to hear us.
<br>We came down once before to buy food:
<br>And when we had bought, and were come to the inn, we opened our sacks, and found our money in the mouths of the sacks: which we have now brought again in the same weight.
<br>And we have brought other money besides, to buy what we want: we cannot tell who put it in our bags.
<br>But he answered: Peace be with you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks. For the money, which you gave me, I have for good. And he brought Simeon out to them.
<br>And having brought them into the house, he fetched water, and they washed their feet, and he gave provender to their asses.
<br>But they made ready the presents, against Joseph came at noon: for they had heard that they should eat bread there.
<br>Then Joseph came in to his house, and they offered him the presents, holding them in their hands; and they bowed down with their face to the ground.
<br>But he courteously saluting them again, asked them, saying: Is the old man your father in health, of whom you told me? Is he yet living?
<br> 
<br>And they answered: Thy servant our fa- ther, is in health; he is yet living. And bowing themselves, they made obeisance to him.
<br>And Joseph lifting up his eyes, saw Ben- jamin, his brother by the same mother, and said: Is this your young brother, of whom you told me? And he said: God be gracious to thee, my son.
<br>And he made haste, because his heart was moved upon his brother, and tears gushed out: and going into his chamber, he wept.
<br>And when he had washed his face, coming out again, he refrained himself, and said: Set bread on the table.
<br>And when it was set on, for Joseph apart, and for his brethren apart, for the Egyptians also that ate with him apart, (for it is unlawful for the Egyptians to eat with the Hebrews, and they think such a feast profane):
<br>They sat before him, the firstborn accord- ing to his birthright, and the youngest according to his age. And they wondered very much;
<br>Taking the messes which they received of him: and the greater mess came to Benjamin, so that it exceeded by five parts. And they drank, and were merry with him.
<br>
<br>Chapter 44
<br>And Joseph commanded the steward of his house, saying: Fill their sacks with corn, as much as they can hold: and put the money of every one in the top of his sack.
<br>And in the mouth of the younger’s sack put my silver cup, and the price which he gave for the wheat.  And it was so done.
<br>And when the morning arose, they were sent away with their asses.
<br>And when they were now departed out of the city, and had gone forward a little way: Joseph
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>sending for the steward of his house, said: Arise, and pursue after the men: and when thou hast overtaken them, say to them: Why have you re- turned evil for good?
<br>The cup which you have stolen, is that in which my lord drinketh, and in which he is wont to divine: you have done a very evil thing.
<br>He did as he had commanded him. And having overtaken them, he spoke to them the same words.
<br>And they answered: Why doth our lord speak so, as though thy servants had commit- ted so heinous a fact?
<br>The money, that we found in the top of our sacks, we brought back to thee from the land of Chanaan: how then should it be that we should steal out of thy lord’s house, gold or silver?
<br>With whomsoever of thy servants shall be found that which thou seekest, let him die, and we will be the bondmen of my lord.
<br>And he said to them: Let it be according to your sentence: with whomsoever it shall be found, let him be my servant, and you shall be blameless.
<br>Then they speedily took down their sacks to the ground, and every man opened his sack.
<br>Which when he had searched, beginning at the eldest, and ending at the youngest, he found the cup in Benjamin’s sack.
<br>Then they rent their garments, and loading their asses again, returned into the town.
<br>And Juda at the head of his brethren went in to Joseph (for he was not yet gone out of the place) and they all together fell down before him on the ground.
<br>And he said to them: Why would you do so? know you not that there is no one like me in the science of divining.
<br>And Juda said to him: What shall we an- swer my lord? or what shall we say, or be able
<br> 
<br>justly to allege?   God hath found out the iniq- uity of thy servants: behold, we are all bondmen to my lord, both we, and he with whom the cup was found.
<br>Joseph answered: God forbid that I should do so: he that stole the cup, he shall be my bondman: and go you away free to your father. 18 Then Juda coming nearer, said boldly: I beseech thee, my lord, let thy servant speak a word in thy ears, and be not angry with thy ser-
<br>vant: for after Pharao thou art.
<br>My lord. Thou didst ask thy servants the first time: Have you a father or a brother.
<br>And we answered thee, my lord: We have a father an old man, and a young boy, that was born in his old age; whose brother by the mother is dead; and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him tenderly.
<br>And thou saidst to thy servants: Bring him hither to me, and I will set my eyes on him.
<br>We suggested to my lord: The boy cannot leave his father: for if he leave him, he will die.
<br>And thou saidst to thy servants: Except your youngest brother come with you, you shall see my face no more.
<br>Therefore when we were gone up to thy servant our father, we told him all that my lord had said.
<br>And our father said: Go again, and buy us a little wheat.
<br>And we said to him: We cannot go: if our youngest brother go down with us, we will set out together: otherwise, without him we dare not see the man’s face.
<br>Whereunto he answered: You know that my wife bore me two.
<br>One went out, and you said: A beast de- voured him; and hitherto he appeareth not.
<br>If you take this also, and any thing befall him in the way, you will bring down my grey
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>hairs with sorrow unto hell.
<br>Therefore, if I shall go to thy servant, our father, and the boy be wanting, (whereas his life dependeth upon the life of him,)
<br>And he shall see that he is not with us, he will die, and thy servants shall bring down his grey hairs with sorrow unto hell.
<br>Let me be thy proper servant, who took him into my trust, and promised, saying: If I bring him not again, I will be guilty of sin against my father for ever.
<br>Therefore I, thy servant, will stay instead of the boy in the service of my lord, and let the boy go up with his brethren.
<br>For I cannot return to my father without the boy, lest I be a witness of the calamity that will oppress my father.
<br>
<br>Chapter 45
<br>Joseph could no longer refrain himself before many that stood by: whereupon he commanded that all should go out, and no stranger be present at their knowing one another.
<br>And he lifted up his voice with weeping, which the Egyptians, and all the house of Pharao heard.
<br>And he said to his brethren: I am Joseph: Is my father yet living? His brethren could not answer him, being struck with exceeding great fear.
<br>And he said mildly to them: Come nearer to me. And when they were come near him, he said: I am Joseph, your brother, whom you sold into Egypt.
<br>Be not afraid, and let it not seem to you a hard case that you sold me into these countries: for God sent me before you into Egypt for your preservation.
<br> 
<br>For it is two years since the famine began to be upon the land, and five years more remain, wherein there can be neither ploughing nor reap- ing.
<br>And God sent me before, that you may be preserved upon the earth, and may have food to live.
<br>Not by your counsel was I sent hither, but by the will of God: who hath made me as it were a father to Pharao, and lord of his whole house, and governor in all the land of Egypt.
<br>Make haste, and go ye up to my father, and say to him: Thus saith thy son Joseph: God hath made me lord of the whole land of Egypt; come down to me, linger not.
<br>And thou shalt dwell in the land of Gessen: and thou shalt be near me, thou and thy sons, and thy sons’ sons, thy sheep, and thy herds, and all things that thou hast.
<br>And there I will feed thee, (for there are yet five years of famine remaining) lest both thou perish, and thy house, and all things that thou hast.
<br>Behold, your eyes, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, see that it is my mouth that speaketh to you.
<br>You shall tell my father of all my glory, and all things that you have seen in Egypt: make haste and bring him to me.
<br>And falling upon the neck of his brother Benjamin, he embraced him and wept: and Ben- jamin in like manner wept also on his neck.
<br>And Joseph kissed all his brethren, and wept upon every one of them: after which they were emboldened to speak to him.
<br>And it was heard, and the fame was spread abroad in the king’s court: The brethren of Joseph are come; and Pharao with all his family was glad.
<br>And he spoke to Joseph that he should give
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>orders to his brethren, saying: Load your beasts, and go into the land of Chanaan,
<br>And bring away from thence your father and kindred, and come to me; and I will give you all the good things of Egypt, that you may eat the marrow of the land.
<br>Give orders also that they take wagons out of the land of Egypt, for the carriage of their children and their wives; and say: Take up your father, and make haste to come with all speed:
<br>And leave nothing of your household stuff; for all the riches of Egypt shall be yours.
<br>And the sons of Israel did as they were bid. And Joseph gave them wagons according to Pharao’s commandment: and provisions for the way.
<br>He ordered also to be brought out for every one of them two robes: but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, with five robes of the best:
<br>Sending to his father as much money and raiment; adding besides, ten he asses, to carry off all the riches of Egypt, and as many she asses, carrying wheat and bread for the journey.
<br>So he sent away his brethren, and at their departing said to them: Be not angry in the way. 25 And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Chanaan, to their father Jacob. 26 And they told him, saying: Joseph,   thy son, is living; and he is ruler in all the land of Egypt. Which when Jacob heard, he awaked as it were out of a deep sleep, yet did not believe
<br>them.
<br>They, on the other side, told the whole order of the thing. And when he saw the wagons, and all that he had sent, his spirit revived,
<br>And he said: It is enough for me if Joseph, my son, be yet living: I will go and see him before I die.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 46
<br>And Israel taking his journey, with all that he had, came to the well of the oath, and killing victims there to the God of his father Isaac,
<br>He heard him, by a vision in the night, call- ing him, and saying to him: Jacob, Jacob. And he answered him: Lo, here I am.
<br>God said to him: I am the most mighty God of thy father; fear not, go down into Egypt, for I will make a great nation of thee there.
<br>I will go down with thee thither, and will bring thee back again from thence: Joseph also shall put his hands upon thy eyes.
<br>And Jacob rose up from the well of the oath: and his sons took him up, with their children and wives in the wagons, which Pharao had sent to carry the old man,
<br>And all that he had in the land of Chanaan: and he came into Egypt with all his seed;
<br>His sons, and grandsons, daughters, and all his offspring together.
<br>And these are the names of the children of Israel, that entered into Egypt, he and his chil- dren. His firstborn Ruben,
<br>The sons of Ruben: Henoch and Phallu, and Hesron and Charmi.
<br>The sons of Simeon: Jamuel and Jamin and Ahod, and Jachin and Sohar, and Saul, the son of a woman of Chanaan.
<br>The sons of Levi: Gerson and Caath, and Merari.
<br>The sons of Juda: Her and Onan, and Sela, and Phares and Zara. And Her and Onan died in the land of Chanaan. And sons were born to Phares: Hesron and Hamul.
<br>The sons of Issachar: Thola and Phua, and Job and Semron.
<br>The sons of Zabulon: Sared, and Elon, and Jahelel.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>These are the sons of Lia, whom she bore in Mesopotamia of Syria, with Dina, his daughter. All the souls of her sons and daughters, thirty- three.
<br>The sons of Gad: Sephion and Haggi, and Suni and Esebon, and Heri and Arodi, and Areli. 17 The sons of Aser: Jamne and Jesua, and Jessuri and Beria, and Sara their sister. The
<br>sons of Beria: Heber and Melchiel.
<br>These are the sons of Zelpha, whom Laban gave to Lia, his daughter. And these she bore to Jacob, sixteen souls.
<br>The sons of Rachel, Jacob’s wife: Joseph and Benjamin.
<br>And sons were born to Joseph, in the land of Egypt, whom Aseneth, the daughter of Putiphare, priest of Heliopolis, bore him: Man- asses and Ephraim.
<br>The sons of Benjamin: Bela and Bechor, and Asbel and Gera, and Naaman and Echi, and Ross and Mophim, and Ophim and Ared.
<br>These are the sons of Rachel, whom she bore to Jacob:  all the souls, fourteen.
<br>The sons of Dan: Husim.
<br>The sons of Nephthali: Jaziel and Guni, and Jeser and Sallem.
<br>These are the sons of Bala, whom Laban gave to Rachel, his daughter: and these she bore to Jacob: all the souls, seven.
<br>All the souls that went with Jacob into Egypt, and that came out of his thigh, besides his sons’ wives, sixty-six.
<br>And the sons of Joseph, that were born to him in the land of Egypt, two souls. All the souls of the house of Jacob, that entered into Egypt, were seventy.
<br>And he sent Juda before him to Joseph, to tell him; and that he should meet him in Gessen.
<br>And when he was come thither, Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet
<br> 
<br>his father in the same place: and seeing him, he fell upon his neck, and embracing him, wept.
<br>And the father said to Joseph: Now shall I die with joy, becuase I have seen thy face, and leave thee alive.
<br>And Joseph said to his brethren, and to all his father’s house: I will go up, and will tell Pharao, and will say to him: My brethren, and my father’s house, that were in the land of Chanaan, are come to me:
<br>And the men are shepherds, and their oc- cupation is to feed cattle; their flocks, and herds, and all they have, they have brought with them. 33 And when he shall call you, and shall say:
<br>What is your occupation?
<br>34 You shall answer: We, thy servants, are shepherds, from our infancy until now, both we and our fathers. And this you shall say, that you may dwell in the land of Gessen, because the Egyptians have all shepherds in abomination.
<br>
<br>Chapter 47
<br>
<br>Then Joseph went in and told Pharao, saying: My father and brethren, their sheep and their herds, and all that they possess, are come out of the land of Chanaan: and behold they stay in the land of Gessen.
<br>Five men also, the last of his brethren, he presented before the king:
<br>And he asked them: What is your occu- pation? They answered: We, thy servants, are shepherds, both we and our fathers.
<br>We are come to sojourn in thy land, because there is no grass for the flocks of thy servants, the famine being very grievous in the land of Chanaan: and we pray thee to give orders that we thy servants may be in the land of Gessen.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>The king therefore said to Joseph: Thy fa- ther and thy brethren are come to thee.
<br>The land of Egypt is before thee: and make them dwell in the best place, and give them the land of Gessen. And if thou knowest that there are industrious men among them, make them rulers over my cattle.
<br>After this Joseph brought in his father to the king, and presented him before him: and he blessed him.
<br>And being asked by him: How many are the days of the years of thy life?
<br>He answered: The days of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty years, few, and evil, and they are not come up to the days of the pilgrimage of my fathers.
<br>And blessing the king, he went out.
<br>But Joseph gave a possession to his fa- ther and his brethren in Egypt, in the best place of the land, in Ramesses, as Pharao had com- manded.
<br>And he nourished them, and all his father’s house, allowing food to every one.
<br>For in the whole world there was want of bread, and a famine had oppressed the land, more especially of Egypt and Chanaan;
<br>Out of which he gathered up all the money for the corn which they bought, and brought it in to the king’s treasure.
<br>And when the buyers wanted money, all Egypt came to Joseph, saying: Give us bread: why should we die in thy presence, having now no money?
<br>And he answered them: Bring me your cat- tle, and for them I will give you food, if you have no money.
<br>And when they had brought them, he gave them food in exchange for their horses, and sheep, and oxen, and asses: and he maintained them that year for the exchange of their cattle.
<br> 
<br>And they came the second year, and said to him: We will not hide from our lord, how that our money is spent, and our cattle also are gone: neither art thou ignorant that we have nothing now left but our bodies and our lands.
<br>Why therefore shall we die before thy eyes? we will be thine, both we and our lands: buy us to be the king’s servants, and give us seed, lest for want of tillers the land be turned into a wilderness.
<br>So Joesph bought all the land of Egypt, every man selling his possessions, because of the greatness of the famine. And he brought it into Pharao’s hands:
<br>And all its people from one end of the bor- ders of Egypt, even to the other end thereof,
<br>Except the land of the priests, which had been given them by the king: to whom also a certain allowance of food was given out of the public stores, and therefore they were not forced to sell their possessions.
<br>Then Joseph said to the people: Behold, as you see, both you and your lands belong to Pharao; take seed and sow the fields,
<br>That you may have corn. The fifth part you shall give to the king; the other four you shall have for seed, and for food for your families and children.
<br>And they answered: our life is in thy hand; only let my lord look favourably upon us, and we will gladly serve the king.
<br>From that time unto this day, in the whole land of Egypt, the fifth part is paid to the kings, and it is become as a law, except the land of the priests, which was free from this covenant.
<br>So Israel dwelt in Egypt, that is, in the land of Gessen, and possessed it; and grew, and was multiplied exceedingly.
<br>And he lived in it seventeen years: and all the days of his life came to a hundred and forty-
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>seven years.
<br>And when he saw that the day of his death drew nigh, he called his son Joseph, and said to him: If I have found favour in thy sight, put thy hand under my thigh; and thou shalt shew me this kindness and truth, not to bury me in Egypt.
<br>But I will sleep with my fathers, and thou shalt take me away out of this land, and bury me in the burying place of my ancestors. And Joseph answered him: I will do what thou hast commanded.
<br>And he said: Swear then to me. And as he was swearing, Israel adored God, turning to the bed’s head.
<br>
<br>Chapter 48
<br>After these things, it was told Joseph that his father was sick; and he set out to go to him, taking his two sons Manasses and Ephraim.
<br>And it was told the old man: Behold thy son Joseph cometh to thee. And being strengthened, he sat on his bed.
<br>And when Joseph was come in to him, he said: God almighty apppeared to me at Luza, which is in the land of Chanaan, and he blessed me,
<br>And said: I will cause thee to increase and multiply, and I will make of thee a multitude of people: and I will give this land to thee, and to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession. 5 So thy two sons, who were born to thee in the land of Egypt before I came hither to thee, shall be mine: Ephraim and Manasses shall be
<br>reputed to me as Ruben and Simeon.
<br>But the rest whom thou shalt have after them, shall be thine, and shall be called by the name of their brethren in their possessions.
<br> 
<br>For, when I came out of Mesopotamia, Rachel died from me in the land of Chanaan in the very journey, and it was spring time: and I was going to Ephrata, and I buried her near the way of Ephrata, which by another name is called Bethlehem.
<br>Then seeing his sons, he said to him: Who are these?
<br>He answered: They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said: Bring them to me, that I may bless them.
<br>For Israel’s eyes were dim by reason of his great age, and he could not see clearly. And when they were brought to him, he kissed and embraced them,
<br>And said to his son: I am not deprived of seeing thee; moreover God hath shewn me thy seed.
<br>And when Joseph had taken them from his father’s lap, he bowed down with his face to the ground.
<br>And he set Ephraim on his right hand, that is, towards the left hand of Israel; but Manasses on his left hand, to wit, towards his father’s right hand, and brought them near to him.
<br>But he, stretching forth his right hand, put it upon the head of Ephraim, the younger brother; and the left upon the head of Manasses, who was the elder, changing his hands.
<br>And Jacob blessed the sons of Joseph, and said: God, in whose sight my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, God that feedeth me from my youth until this day:
<br>The angel that delivereth me from all evils, bless these boys: and let my name be called upon them, and the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and may they grow into a multitude upon the earth.
<br>And Joseph seeing that his father had put his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, was
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>much displeased: and taking his father’s hand, he tried to lift it from Ephraim’s head, and to remove it to the head of Manasses.
<br>And he said to his father: It should not be so, my father; for this is the firstborn, put thy right hand upon his head.
<br>But he refusing, said: I know, my son, I know: and this also shall become a people, and shall be multiplied; but his younger brother shall be greater than he; and his seed shall grow into nations.
<br>And he blessed them at that time, saying: In thee shall Israel be blessed, and it shall be said: God do to thee as to Ephraim, and as to Manasses. And he set Ephraim before Manasses. 21 And he said to Joseph, his son: Behold I die, and God will be with you, and will bring
<br>you back into the land of your fathers.
<br>22 I give thee a portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorrhite with my sword and bow.
<br>
<br>Chapter 49
<br>And Jacob called his sons, and said to them: Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you the things that shall befall you in the last days. 2 Gather yourselves together, and hear, O ye
<br>sons of Jacob, hearken to Israel, your father:
<br>Ruben, my firstborn, thou art my strength, and the beginning of my sorrow; excelling in gifts, greater in command.
<br>Thou art poured out as water, grow thou not; because thou wentest up to thy father’s bed, and didst defile his couch.
<br>Simeon and Levi brethren: vessels of iniq- uity waging war.
<br>Let not my soul go into their counsel, nor my glory be in their assembly: because in their
<br> 
<br>fury they slew a man, and in their selfwill they undermined a wall.
<br>Cursed be their fury, because it was stub- born: and their wrath, because it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and will scatter them in Israel.
<br>Juda, thee shall thy brethren praise: thy hand shall be on the necks of thy enemies; the sons of thy father shall bow down to thee.
<br>Juda is a lion’s whelp: to the prey, my son, thou art gone up: resting thou hast couched as a lion, and as a lioness, who shall rouse him?
<br>The sceptre shall not be taken away from Juda, nor a ruler from his thigh, till he come that is to be sent, and he shall be the expectation of nations.
<br>Tying his foal to the vineyard, and his ass, O my son, to the vine. He shall wash his robe in wine, and his garment in the blood of the grape. 12 His eyes are more beautiful than wine, and
<br>his teeth whiter than milk.
<br>Zabulon shall dwell on the seashore, and in the road of ships, reaching as far as Sidon.
<br>Issachar shall be a strong ass, lying down between the borders.
<br>He saw rest that it was good: and the land that it was excellent: and he bowed his shoulder to carry, and became a servant under tribute.
<br>Dan shall judge his people like another tribe in Israel.
<br>Let Dan be a snake in the way, a serpent in the path, that biteth the horse’s heels, that his rider may fall backward.
<br>I will look for thy salvation, O Lord.
<br>Gad, being girded, shall fight before him: and he himself shall be girded backward.
<br>Aser, his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield dainties to kings.
<br>Nephthali, a hart let loose, and giving words of beauty.

<br>Joseph is a growing son, a growing son and comely to behold: the daughters run to and fro upon the wall;
<br>But they that held darts, provoked him, and quarrelled with him, and envied him.
<br>His bow rested upon the strong, and the bands of his arms and his hands were loosed, by the hands of the mighty one of Jacob: thence he came forth a pastor, the stone of Israel.
<br>The God of thy father shall be thy helper, and the Almighty shall bless thee with the bless- ings of heaven above, with the blessings of the deep that lieth beneath, with the blessings of the breasts and of the womb.
<br>The blessings of thy father are strength- ened with the blessings of his fathers: until the desire of the everlasting hills should come: may they be upon the head of Joseph, and upon the crown of the Nazarite among his brethren.
<br>Benjamin a ravenous wolf, in the morning shall eat the prey, and in the evening shall divide the spoil.
<br>All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: these things their father spoke to them, and he blessed every one with their proper blessings.
<br>And he charged them, saying: I am now going to be gathered to my people: bury me with my fathers in the double cave, which is in the field of Ephron the Hethite,
<br>Over against Mambre, in the land of Chanaan, which Abraham bought together with the field, of Ephron the Hethite, for a possession to bury in.
<br>There they buried him, and Sara his wife: there was Isaac buried with Rebecca, his wife: there also Lia doth lie buried.
<br>And when he had ended the command- ments, wherewith he instructed his sons, he drew up his feet upon the bed, and died: and he was gathered to his people.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 50
<br>And when Joseph saw this, he fell upon his fa- ther’s face, weeping and kissing him.
<br>And he commanded his servants, the physi- cians, to embalm his father.
<br>And while they were fulfilling his commands, there passed forty days: for this was the man- ner with bodies that were embalmed, and Egypt mourned for him seventy days.
<br>And the time of the mourning being expired, Joseph spoke to the family of Pharao: If I have found favour in your sight, speak in the ears of Pharao:
<br>For my father made me swear to him, saying: Behold I die; thou shalt bury me in my sepulchre which I have digged for myself in the land of Chanaan. So I will go up and bury my father, and return.
<br>And Pharao said to him: Go up and bury thy father according as he made thee swear.
<br>So he went up, and there went with him all the ancients of Pharao’s house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt.
<br>And the house of Joseph with his brethren, except their children, and their flocks and herds, which they left in the land of Gessen.
<br>He had also in his train chariots and horse- men: and it was a great company.
<br>And they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is situated beyond the Jordan: where celebrating the exequies with a great and vehement lamentation, they spent full seven days.
<br>And when the inhabitants of Chanaan saw this, they said: This is a great mourning to the Egyptians. And therefore the name of that place was called, The mourning of Egypt.
<br>So the sons of Jacob did as he had com- manded them.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>And carrying him into the land of Chanaan, they buried him in the double cave, which Abraham had bought together with the field for a possession of a burying place, of Eh- pron, the Hethite, over against Mambre.
<br>And Joseph returned into Egypt with his brethren, and all that were in his company, after he had buried his father.
<br>Now he being dead, his brethren were afraid, and talked one with another: Lest per- haps he should remember the wrong he suffered, and requite us all the evil that we did to him.
<br>And they sent a message to him, saying: Thy father commanded us before he died,
<br>That we should say thus much to thee from him: I beseech thee to forget the wickedness of thy brethren, and the sin and malice they prac- tised against thee: we also pray thee, to forgive the servants of the God of thy father this wicked- ness. And when Joseph heard this, he wept.
<br>And his brethren came to him; and wor- shipping prostrate on the ground, they said: We are thy servants.
<br>And he answered them: Fear not: can we resist the will of God?
<br>You thought evil against me: but God turned it into good, that he might exalt me, as at present you see, and might save many people. 21 Fear not: I will feed you and your children.
<br>And he comforted them, and spoke gently and mildly.
<br>And he dwelt in Egypt with all his father’s house; and lived a hundred and ten years. And he saw the children of Ephraim to the third gen- eration. The children also of Machir, the sons of Manasses, were born on Joseph’s knees.
<br>After which he told his brethren: God will visit you after my death, and will make you go up out of this land, to the land which he swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
<br> 
<br>And he made them swear to him, saying: God will visit you, carry my bones with you out of this place:
<br>And he died, being a hundred and ten years old. And being embalmed, he was laid in a coffin in Egypt.

<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>These are the names of the children of Israel, that went into Egypt with Jacob: they went in every man with his household:
<br>Ruben, Simeon, Levi, Juda,
<br>Issachar, Zabulon, and Benjamin,
<br>Dan, and Nephthali, Gad and Aser.
<br>And all the souls that came out of Jacob’s thigh, were seventy:  but Joseph was in Egypt.
<br>After he was dead, and all his brethren, and all that generation,
<br>The children of Israel increased, and sprung up into multitudes, and growing exceedingly strong they filled the land.
<br>In the mean time there arose a new king over Egypt, that knew not Joseph:
<br>And he said to his people: Behold the peo- ple of the children of Israel are numerous and stronger than we.
<br>Come let us wisely oppress them, lest they multiply: and if any war shall rise against us, join with our enemies, and having overcome us, depart out of the land.
<br>Therefore he set over them masters of the works, to afflict them with burdens: and they built for Pharao cities of tabernacles, Phithom, and Ramesses.
<br>But the more they oppressed them, the more they were multiplied and increased.
<br>And the Egyptians hated the children of Israel, and afflicted them and mocked them:
<br> 
<br>
<br>And they made their life bitter with hard works in clay and brick, and with all manner of service, wherewith they were overcharged in the works of the earth.
<br>And the king of Egypt spoke to the mid- wives of the Hebrews: of whom one was called Sephora, the other Phua,
<br>Commanding them: When you shall do the office of midwives to the Hebrew women, and the time of delivery is come: if it be a man child, kill it: if a woman, keep it alive.
<br>But the midwives feared God, and did not do as the king of Egypt had commanded, but saved the men children.
<br>They answered: The Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women: for they themselves are skilful in the office of a midwife; and they are delivered before we come to them.
<br>Therefore God dealt well with the mid- wives: and the people multiplied and grew ex- ceedingly strong.
<br>And because the midwives feared God, he built them houses.
<br>Pharao therefore charged all his people, saying: Whatsoever shall be born of the male sex, ye shall cast into the river: whatsoever of the female, ye shall save alive.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 2
<br>After this there went a man of the house of Levi; and took a wife of his own kindred.
<br>2 And she conceived, and bore a son: and seeing him a goodly child, hid him three months. 3 And when she could hide him no longer, she took a basket made of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and pitch: and put the little babe therein, and laid him in the sedges by the river’s
<br>brink,
<br>His sister standing afar off, and taking notice what would be done.
<br>And behold the daughter of Pharao came down to wash herself in the river: and her maids walked by the river’s brink. And when she saw the basket in the sedges she sent one of her maids for it: and when it was brought,
<br>She opened it, and seeing within it an infant crying, having compassion on it, she said: This is one of the babes of the Hebrews.
<br>And the child’s sister said to her: Shall I go, and call to thee a Hebrew woman, to nurse the babe?
<br>She answered: Go. The maid went and called her mother.
<br>And Pharao’s daughter said to her: Take this child, and nurse him for me: I will give thee thy wages.   The woman took and nursed the child: and when he was grown up, she deliv- ered him to Pharao’s daughter.
<br>And she adopted him for a son, and called him Moses, saying: Because I took him out of the water.
<br>In those days, after Moses was grown up, he went out to his brethren: and saw their affliction, and an Egyptian striking one of the Hebrews, his brethren.
<br>And when he had looked about this way and that way, and saw no one there, he slew the
<br> 
<br>Egyptian and hid him in the sand.
<br>And going out the next day, he saw two Hebrews quarrelling: and he said to him that did the wrong: Why strikest thou thy neighbour?
<br>But he answered: Who hath appointed thee prince and judge over us? wilt thou kill me, as thou didst yesterday kill the Egyptian? Moses feared, and said: How is this come to be known?
<br>And Pharao heard of this word, and sought to kill Moses: but he fled from his sight, and abode in the land of Madian, and he sat down by a well.
<br>And the priest of Madian had seven daugh- ters, who came to draw water: and when the troughs were filled, desired to water their father’s flocks.
<br>And the shepherds came and drove them away: and Moses arose, and defending the maids, watered their sheep.
<br>19 They answered: A man of Egypt delivered us from the hands of the shepherds: and he drew water also with us, and gave the sheep to drink. 20 But he said: Where is he? why have you let the man go? call him that he may eat bread. 21 And Moses swore that he would dwell with him. And he took Sephora his daughter to wife: 22 And she bore him a son, whom he called Gersam, saying: I have been a stranger in a for- eign country. And she bore another, whom he called Eliezer, saying: For the God of my father, my helper, hath delivered me out of the hand of
<br>Pharao.
<br>Now after a long time the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel groaning, cried out because of the works: and their cry went up unto God from the works.
<br>And he heard their groaning, and remem- bered the covenant which he made with Abra- ham, Isaac, and Jacob.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>And the Lord looked upon the children of Israel, and he knew them.
<br>
<br>Chapter 3
<br>Now Moses fed the sheep of Jethro, his father in law, the priest of Madian: and he drove the flock to the inner parts of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, Horeb.
<br>And the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he saw that the bush was on fire, and was not burnt.
<br>And Moses said: I will go, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.
<br>And when the Lord saw that he went for- ward to see, he called to him out of the midst of the bush. and said: Moses, Moses. And he answered: Here I am.
<br>And he said: Come not nigh hither, put off the shoes from thy feet; for the place, whereon thou standest, is holy ground.
<br>And he said:  I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Moses hid his face: for he durst not look at God.
<br>And the Lord said to him: I have seen the affliction of my people in Egypt, and I have heard their cry because of the rigour of them that are over the works;
<br>And knowing their sorrow, I am come down to deliver them out of the hands of the Egyp- tians, and to bring them out of that land into a good and spacious land, into a land that floweth with milk and honey, to the places of the Chanaanite, and Hethite, and Amorrhite, and Pherezite, and Hevite, and Jebusite.
<br>For the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have seen their affliction, where- with they are oppressed by the Egyptians.
<br> 
<br>But come, and I will send thee to Pharao, that thou mayst bring forth my people, the chil- dren of Israel, out of Egypt.
<br>And Moses said to God: Who am I that I should go to Pharao, and should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?
<br>And he said to him: I will be with thee; and this thou shalt have for a sign that I have sent thee: When thou shalt have brought my people out of Egypt, thou shalt offer sacrifice to God upon this mountain.
<br>Moses said to God: Lo, I shall go to the children of Israel, and say to them: The God of your fathers hath sent me to you. If they shall say to me: What is his name? What shall I say to them?
<br>God said to Moses: I AM WHO AM. He said: Thus shalt thou say to the children of Is- rael: HE WHO IS, hath sent me to you.
<br>And God said again to Moses: Thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel: The Lord God of your fathers the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob hath sent me to you; this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.
<br>Go and gather together the ancients of Is- rael, and thou shalt say to them: The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham,  the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared to me, saying: Visiting I have visited you; and I have seen all that hath befallen you in Egypt.
<br>And I have said the word to bring you forth out of the affliction of Egypt, into the land of the Chanaanite, and Hethite, and Amorrhite, and Pherezite, and Hevite, and Jebusite, to a land that floweth with milk and honey.
<br>But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go, but by a mighty hand.
<br>For I will stretch forth my hand, and will strike Egypt with all my wonders which I will do
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>in the midst of them: after these he will let you go.
<br>And I will give favour to this people, in the sight of the Egyptians: and when you go forth, you shall not depart empty:
<br>But every woman shall ask of her neigh- bour, and of her that is in her house, vessels of silver and of gold, and raiment: and you shall put them on your sons and daughters, and shall spoil Egypt.
<br>
<br>Chapter 4
<br>Moses answered, and said: They will not believe me, nor hear my voice, but they will say: The Lord hath not appeared to thee.
<br>Then he said to him: What is that thou holdest in thy hand? He answered: A rod.
<br>And the Lord said: Cast it down upon the ground. He cast it down, and it was turned into a serpent, so that Moses fled from it.
<br>And the Lord said: Put out thy hand, and take it by the tail. He put forth his hand, and took hold of it, and it was turned into a rod.
