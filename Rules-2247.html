<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>If the chief State election official determines that the State is unable to meet the requirement under subsection (a)(8)(A) with respect to an election for Federal office due to an undue hardship described in paragraph (2)(B), the chief State election official shall request that the Presidential designee grant a waiver to the State of the application of such subsection.

<br>
<br>(A) a recognition that the purpose of such subsection is to allow absent uniformed services voters and overseas voters enough time to vote in an election for Federal office;
<br>
<br>(B) an explanation of the hardship that indicates why the State is unable to transmit absent uniformed services voters and overseas voters an absentee ballot in accordance with such subsection;
<br>
<br>(C) the number of days prior to the election for Federal office that the State requires absentee ballots be transmitted to absent uniformed services voters and overseas voters; and
<br>
<br>(D) a comprehensive plan to ensure that absent uniformed services voters and overseas voters are able to receive absentee ballots which they have requested and submit marked absentee ballots to the appropriate State election official in time to have that ballot counted in the election for Federal office, which includes—
<br>
<br>(i) the steps the State will undertake to ensure that absent uniformed services voters and overseas voters have time to receive, mark, and submit their ballots in time to have those ballots counted in the election;
<br>
<br>(ii) why the plan provides absent uniformed services voters and overseas voters sufficient time to vote as a substitute for the requirements under such subsection; and
<br>
<br>(iii) the underlying factual information which explains how the plan provides such sufficient time to vote as a substitute for such requirements.
<br>(2) Approval of waiver request
<br>
<br>After consulting with the Attorney General, the Presidential designee shall approve a waiver request under paragraph (1) if the Presidential designee determines each of the following requirements are met:
<br>
<br>(A) The comprehensive plan under subparagraph (D) of such paragraph provides absent uniformed services voters and overseas voters sufficient time to receive absentee ballots they have requested and submit marked absentee ballots to the appropriate State election official in time to have that ballot counted in the election for Federal office.
<br>
<br>(B) One or more of the following issues creates an undue hardship for the State:
<br>
<br>(i) The State's primary election date prohibits the State from complying with subsection (a)(8)(A).
<br>
<br>(ii) The State has suffered a delay in generating ballots due to a legal contest.
<br>
<br>(iii) The State Constitution prohibits the State from complying with such subsection.
<br>(3) Timing of waiver
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided under subparagraph (B), a State that requests a waiver under paragraph (1) shall submit to the Presidential designee the written waiver request not later than 90 days before the election for Federal office with respect to which the request is submitted. The Presidential designee shall approve or deny the waiver request not later than 65 days before such election.
<br>(B) Exception
<br>
<br>If a State requests a waiver under paragraph (1) as the result of an undue hardship described in paragraph (2)(B)(ii), the State shall submit to the Presidential designee the written waiver request as soon as practicable. The Presidential designee shall approve or deny the waiver request not later than 5 business days after the date on which the request is received.
<br>(4) Application of waiver
<br>
<br>A waiver approved under paragraph (2) shall only apply with respect to the election for Federal office for which the request was submitted. For each subsequent election for Federal office, the Presidential designee shall only approve a waiver if the State has submitted a request under paragraph (1) with respect to such election.
<br>(h) Tracking marked ballots
<br>
<br>The chief State election official, in coordination with local election jurisdictions, shall develop a free access system by which an absent uniformed services voter or overseas voter may determine whether the absentee ballot of the absent uniformed services voter or overseas voter has been received by the appropriate State election official.
<br>(i) Prohibiting refusal to accept applications for failure to meet certain requirements
<br>
<br>A State shall not refuse to accept and process any otherwise valid voter registration application or absentee ballot application (including the official post card form prescribed under section 20301 of this title) or marked absentee ballot submitted in any manner by an absent uniformed services voter or overseas voter solely on the basis of the following:

<br>(1) In completing the ballot, the absent uniformed services voter or overseas voter may designate a candidate by writing in the name of the candidate or by writing in the name of a political party (in which case the ballot shall be counted for the candidate of that political party).
<br>
<br>(2) In the case of the offices of President and Vice President, a vote for a named candidate or a vote by writing in the name of a political party shall be counted as a vote for the electors supporting the candidate involved.
<br>
<br>(3) Any abbreviation, misspelling, or other minor variation in the form of the name of a candidate or a political party shall be disregarded in determining the validity of the ballot, if the intention of the voter can be ascertained.
<br>(d) Second ballot submission; instruction to absent uniformed services voter or overseas voter
<br>
<br>An absent uniformed services voter or overseas voter who submits a Federal write-in absentee ballot and later receives a State absentee ballot, may submit the State absentee ballot. The Presidential designee shall assure that the instructions for each Federal write-in absentee ballot clearly state that an absent uniformed services voter or overseas voter who submits a Federal write-in absentee ballot and later receives and submits a State absentee ballot should make every reasonable effort to inform the appropriate State election official that the voter has submitted more than one ballot.
<br>(e) Use of approved State absentee ballot in place of Federal write-in absentee ballot
<br>
<br>The Federal write-in absentee ballot shall not be valid for use in a general, special, primary, or runoff election for Federal office if the State involved provides a State absentee ballot that—
<br>
<br>(1) at the request of the State, is approved by the Presidential designee for use in place of the Federal write-in absentee ballot; and
<br>
<br>(2) is made available to absent uniformed services voters and overseas voters at least 60 days before the deadline for receipt of the State ballot under State law.
<br>(f) Prohibiting refusal to accept ballot for failure to meet certain requirements
<br>
<br>A State shall not refuse to accept and process any otherwise valid Federal write-in absentee ballot submitted in any manner by an absent uniformed services voter or overseas voter solely on the basis of the following:

<br>(1) Notarization requirements.
<br>
<br>(2) Restrictions on paper type, including weight and size.
<br>
<br>(3) Restrictions on envelope type, including weight and size.
<br>(g) Certain States exempted
<br>
<br>A State is not required to permit use of the Federal write-in absentee ballot, if, on and after August 28, 1986, the State has in effect a law providing that—
<br>
<br>(1) a State absentee ballot is required to be available to any voter described in section 20310(5)(A) of this title at least 90 days before the general, special, primary, or runoff election for Federal office involved; and

<br>(a) Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) the right of citizens of the United States to vote is a fundamental right;
<br>
<br>(2) it is the duty of the Federal, State, and local governments to promote the exercise of that right; and
<br>
<br>(3) discriminatory and unfair registration laws and procedures can have a direct and damaging effect on voter participation in elections for Federal office and disproportionately harm voter participation by various groups, including racial minorities.
<br>(b) Purposes
<br>
<br>The purposes of this chapter are—
<br>
<br>(1) to establish procedures that will increase the number of eligible citizens who register to vote in elections for Federal office;
<br>
<br>(2) to make it possible for Federal, State, and local governments to implement this chapter in a manner that enhances the participation of eligible citizens as voters in elections for Federal office;
<br>
<br>(3) to protect the integrity of the electoral process; and
<br>
<br>(4) to ensure that accurate and current voter registration rolls are maintained.
