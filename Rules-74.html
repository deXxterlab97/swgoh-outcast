<br>39	Now when many sacrileges had been com- mitted by Lysimachus in the temple, by the counsel of Menelaus, and the rumour of it was spread abroad, the multitude gathered them- selves together against Lysimachus, a great quantity of gold being already carried away.
<br>40	Wherefore the multitude making an insur- rection, and their minds being filled with anger, Lysimachus armed about three thousand men, and began to use violence, one Tyrannus being captain, a man far gone both in age and in mad- ness.
<br>41	But when they perceived the attempt of Lysimachus, some caught up stones, some strong clubs, and some threw ashes upon Lysimachus.
<br>42	And many of them were wounded, and some struck down to the ground, but all were put to flight: and as for the sacrilegious fellow himself, they slew him beside the treasury.
<br>43	Now concerning these matters, an accusa- tion was laid against Menelaus.
<br>44	And when the king was come to Tyre, three men were sent from the ancients to plead the cause before him.
<br>45	But Menelaus being convicted, promised Ptolemee to give him much money to persuade the king to favour him.
<br>46	So Ptolemee went to the king in a certain court where he was, as it were to cool himself, and brought him to be of another mind:
<br>47	So Menelaus, who was guilty of all the evil, was acquitted by him of the accusations: and those poor men, who, if they had pleaded their cause even before Scythians, should have been judged innocent, were condemned to death.
<br>48	Thus they that persecuted the cause for the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>city, and for the people, and the sacred vessels, did soon suffer unjust punishment.
<br>49	Wherefore even the Tyrians, being moved with indignation, were very liberal towards their burial.
<br>50	And so through the covetousness of them that were in power, Menelaus continued in au- thority, increasing in malice to the betraying of the citizens.
<br>
<br>Chapter 5
<br>At the same time Antiochus prepared for a sec- ond journey into Egypt.
<br>2	And it came to pass, that through the whole city of Jerusalem, for the space of forty days, there were seen horsemen running in the air, in gilded raiment, and armed with spears, like bands of soldiers.
<br>3	And horses set in order by ranks, running one against another, with the shakings of shields, and a multitude of men in helmets, with drawn swords, and casting of darts, and glittering of golden armour, and of harnesses of all sorts.
<br>4	Wherefore all men prayed that these prodi- gies might turn to good.
<br>5	Now when there was gone forth a false ru- mour as though Antiochus had been dead, Jason taking with him no fewer than a thousand men, suddenly assaulted the city: and though the cit- izens ran together to the wall, the city at length was taken, and Menelaus fled into the castle.
<br>6	But Jason slew his countrymen without mercy, not considering that prosperity against one’s own kindred is a very great evil, thinking they had been enemies, and not citizens, whom he conquered.
<br>7	Yet he did not get the principality, but re- ceived confusion at the end, for the reward of his
<br> 
<br>treachery, and fled again into the country of the Ammonites.
<br>8	At the last, having been shut up by Are- tas, the king of the Arabians, in order for his destruction, flying from city to city, hated by all men, as a forsaker of the laws and execrable, as an enemy of his country and countrymen, he was thrust out into Egypt:
<br>9	And he that had driven many out of their country perished in a strange land, going to Lacedemon, as if for kindred sake he should have refuge there:
<br>10	But he that had cast out many unburied, was himself cast forth both unlamented and un- buried, neither having foreign burial, nor being partaker of the sepulchre of his fathers.
<br>11	Now when these things were done, the king suspected that the Jews would forsake the al- liance: whereupon departing out of Egypt with a furious mind, he took the city by force of arms, 12 And commanded the soldiers to kill, and not to spare any that came in their way, and to
<br>go up into the houses to slay.
<br>13	Thus there was a slaughter of young and old, destruction of women and children, and killing of virgins and infants.
<br>14	And there were slain in the space of three whole days fourscore thousand, forty thousand were made prisoners, and as many sold.
<br>15	But this was not enough, he presumed also to enter into the temple, the most holy in all the world Menelaus, that traitor to the laws, and to his country, being his guide.
<br>16	And taking in his wicked hands the holy vessels, which were given by other kings and cities, for the ornament and the glory of the place, he unworthily handled and profaned them. 17 Thus Antiochus going astray in mind, did not consider that God was angry for a while, because of the sins of the inhabitants of the city:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>and therefore this contempt had happened to the place:
<br>18	Otherwise had they not been involved in many sins, as Heliodorus, who was sent by king Seleucus to rob the treasury, so this man also, as soon as he had come, had been forthwith scourged, and put back from his presumption.
<br>19	But God did not choose the people for the place’s sake, but the place for the people’s sake. 20 And, therefore, the place also itself was made partaker of the evils of the people: but afterwards shall communicate in the good things thereof, and as it was forsaken in the wrath of Almighty God, shall be exalted again with great
<br>glory, when the great Lord shall be reconciled.
<br>21	So when Antiochus had taken away out of the temple a thousand and eight hundred talents, he went back in all haste to Antioch, thinking through pride that he might now make the land navigable, and the sea passable on foot: such was the haughtiness of his mind.
<br>22	He left also governors to afflict the people: at Jerusalem, Philip, a Phrygian by birth, but in manners more barbarous than he that set him there:
<br>23	And in Gazarim, Andronicus and Menelaus, who bore a more heavy hand upon the citizens than the rest.
<br>24	And whereas he was set against the Jews, he sent that hateful prince, Apollonius, with an army of two and twenty thousand men, com- manding him to kill all that were of perfect age, and to sell the women and the younger sort.
<br>25	Who, when he was come to Jerusalem, pre- tending peace, rested till the holy day of the sabbath: and then the Jews keeping holiday, he commanded his men to take arms.
<br>26	And he slew all that were come forth to flee: and running through the city with armed men, he destroyed a very great multitude.
<br> 
<br>27	But Judas Machabeus, who was the tenth, had withdrawn himself into a desert place, and there lived amongst wild beasts in the mountains with his company: and they continued feeding on herbs, that they might not be partakers of the pollution.
<br>
<br>Chapter 6
<br>But not long after the king sent a certain old man of Antioch, to compel the Jews to depart from the laws of their fathers and of God:
<br>2	And to defile the temple that was in Jerusalem, and to call it the temple of Jupiter Olympius: and that in Garazim of Jupiter Hos- pitalis, according as they were that inhabited the place.
<br>3	And very bad was this invasion of evils, and grievous to all.
<br>4	For the temple was full of the riot and rev- ellings of the Gentiles: and of men lying with lewd women. And women thrust themselves of their accord into the holy places, and brought in things that were not lawful.
<br>5	The altar also was filled with unlawful things, which were forbidden by the laws.
<br>6	And neither were the sabbaths kept, nor the solemn days of the fathers observed, neither did any man plainly profess himself to be a Jew.
<br>7	But they were led by bitter constraint on the king’s birthday to the sacrifices: and when the feast of Bacchus was kept, they were com- pelled to go about crowned with ivy in honour of Bacchus.
<br>8	And there went out a decree into the neigh- bouring cities of the Gentiles, by the suggestion of the Ptolemeans, that they also should act in like manner against the Jews, to oblige them to sacrifice:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>9	And whosoever would not conform them- selves to the ways of the Gentiles, should be put to death: then was misery to be seen.
<br>10	For two women were accused to have cir- cumcised their children: whom, when they had openly led about through the city, with the in- fants hanging at their breasts, they threw down headlong from the walls.
<br>11	And others that had met together in caves that were near, and were keeping the sabbath day privately, being discovered by Philip, were burnt with fire, because they made a conscience to help themselves with their hands, by reason of the religious observance of the day.
<br>12	Now I beseech those that shall read this book, that they be not shocked at these calami- ties, but that they consider the things that hap- pened, not as being for the destruction, but for the correction of our nation.
<br>13	For it is a token of great goodness, when sinners are not suffered to go on in their ways for a long time, but are presently punished.
<br>14	For, not as with other nations, (whom the Lord patiently expecteth, that when the day of judgment shall come, he may punish them in the fulness of their sins:)
<br>15	Doth he also deal with us, so as to suffer our sins to come to their height, and then take vengeance on us.
<br>16	And therefore he never withdraweth his mercy from us: but though he chastise his people with adversity he forsaketh them not.
<br>17	But let this suffice in a few words for a warning to the readers. And now we must come to the narration.
<br>18	Eleazar one of the chief of the scribes, a man advanced in years, and of a comely coun- tenance, was pressed to open his mouth to eat swine’s flesh.
<br>19	But he, choosing rather a most glorious
<br> 
<br>death than a hateful life, went forward voluntar- ily to the torment.
<br>20	And considering in what manner he was to come to it, patiently bearing, he determined not to do any unlawful things for the love of life.
<br>21	But they that stood by, being moved with wicked pity, for the old friendship they had with the man, taking him aside, desired that flesh might be brought which it was lawful for him to eat, that he might make as if he had eaten, as the king had commanded, of the flesh of the sacrifice:
<br>22	That by so doing he might be delivered from death; and for the sake of their old friend- ship with the man, they did him this courtesy.
<br>23	But he began to consider the dignity of his age, and his ancient years, and the inbred hon- our of his grey head, and his good life and con- versation from a child; and he answered without delay, according to the ordinances of the holy law made by God, saying, that he would rather be sent into the other world.
<br>24	For it doth not become our age, said he, to dissemble: whereby many young persons might think that Eleazar, at the age of fourscore and ten years, was gone over to the life of the hea- thens:
<br>25	And so they, through my dissimulation, and for a little time of a corruptible life, should be deceived, and hereby I should bring a stain and a curse upon my old age.
<br>26	For though, for the present time, I should be delivered from the punishments of men, yet should I not escape the hand of the Almighty neither alive nor dead.
<br>27	Wherefore, by departing manfully out of this life, I shall shew myself worthy of my old age:
<br>28	And I shall leave an example of fortitude to young men, if with a ready mind and constancy
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>I suffer an honourable death, for thc most ven- erable and most holy laws. And having spoken thus, he was forthwith carried to execution.
<br>29	And they that led him, and had been a little before more mild, were changed to wrath for the words he had spoken, which they thought were uttered out of arrogancy.
<br>30	But when be was now ready to die with the stripes, he groaned: and said: O Lord, who hast the holy knowledge, thou knowest mani- festly that whereas I might be delivered from death, I suffer grievous pains in body: but in soul am well content to suffer these things, be- cause I fear thee.
<br>31	Thus did this man die, leaving not only to young men, but also to the whole nation, the memory of his death, for an example of virtue and fortitude.
<br>
<br>Chapter 7
<br>It came to pass also, that seven brethren, to- gether with their mother, were apprehended, and compelled by the king to eat swine’s flesh against the law, for which end they were tormented with whips and scourges.
<br>2	But one of them, who was the eldest, said thus: What wouldst thou ask, or learn of us? we are ready to die, rather than to transgress the laws of God, received from our fathers.
<br>3	Then the king being angry, commanded fry- ingpans and brazen caldrons to be made hot: which forthwith being heated,
<br>4	He commanded to cut out the tongue of him that had spoken first: and the skin of his head being drawn off, to chop off also the extremities of his hands and feet, the rest of his brethren and his mother looking on.
<br>6 And when he was now maimed in all parts,
<br> 
<br>he commanded him, being yet alive, to be brought to the fire, and to be fried in the fry- ingpan: and while he was suffering therein long torments, the rest, together with the mother, ex- horted one another to die manfully,
<br>6	Saying: The Lord God will look upon the truth, and will take pleasure in us, as Moses de- clared in the profession of the canticle; And in his servants he will take pleasure.
<br>7	So when the first was dead after this manner, they brought the next to make him a mocking stock: and when they had pulled off the skin of his head with the hair, they asked him if he would eat, before he were punished throughout the whole body in every limb.
<br>8	But he answered in his own language, and said: I will not do it. Wherefore he also, in the next place, received the torments of the first:
<br>9	And when he was at the last gasp, he said thus: Thou indeed, O most wicked man, de- stroyest us out of this present life: but the King of the world will raise us up, who die for his laws, in the resurrection of eternal life.
<br>10	After him the third was made a mocking- stock, and when he was required, he quickly put forth his tongue, and courageously stretched out his hands:
<br>11	And said with confidence: These I have from heaven, but for the laws of God I now de- spise them, because I hope to receive them again from him.
<br>12	So that the king, and they that were with him, wondered at the young man’s courage, be- cause he esteemed the torments as nothing.
<br>13	And after he was thus dead, they tor- mented the fourth in the like manner.
<br>14	And when he was now ready to die, he spoke thus: It is better, being put to death by men, to look for hope from God, to be raised up again by him; for, as to thee, thou shalt have no
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>resurrection unto life.
<br>15	And when they had brought the fifth, they tormented him. But he, looking upon the king,
<br>16	Said: Whereas thou hast power among men though thou art corruptible, thou dost what thou wilt but think not that our nation is for- saken by God.
<br>17	But stay patiently a while, and thou shalt see his great power, in what manner he will tor- ment thee and thy seed.
<br>18	After him they brought the sixth, and he being ready to die, spoke thus: Be not deceived without cause: for we suffer these things for ourselves, having sinned against our God, and things worthy of admiration are done to us:
<br>19	But do not think that thou shalt escape un- punished, for that thou hast attempted to fight against God.
<br>20	Now the mother was to be admired above measure, and worthy to be remembered by good men, who beheld her seven sons slain in the space of one day, and bore it with a good courage, for the hope that she had in God:
<br>21	And she bravely exhorted every one of them in her own language, being filled with wis- dom; and joining a man’s heart to a woman’s thought,
<br>22	She said to them: I know not how you were formed in my womb; for I neither gave you breath, nor soul, nor life, neither did I frame the limbs of every one of you.
<br>23	But the Creator of the world, that formed the nativity of man, and that found out the ori- gin of all, he will restore to you again, in his mercy, both breath and life, as now you despise yourselves for the sake of his laws.
<br>24	Now Antiochus, thinking himself despised, and withal despising the voice of the upbraider, when the youngest was yet alive, did not only exhort him by words, but also assured him with
<br> 
<br>an oath, that he would make him a rich and a happy man, and, if he would turn from the laws of his fathers, would take him for a friend, and furnish him with things necessary.
<br>25	But when the young man was not moved with these things, the king called the mother, and counselled her to deal with the young man to save his life.
<br>26	And when he had exhorted her with many words she promised that she would counsel her son.
<br>27	So bending herself towards him, mocking the cruel tyrant, she said in her own language: My son have pity upon me, that bore thee nine months in my womb, and gave thee suck three years, and nourished thee, and brought thee up unto this age.
<br>28	I beseech thee, my son, look upon heaven and earth, and all that is in them, and con- sider that God made them out of nothing, and mankind also:
<br>29	So thou shalt not fear this tormentor, but being made a worthy partner with thy brethren, receive death, that in that mercy I may receive thee again with thy brethren.
<br>30	While she was yet speaking these words, the young man said: For whom do you stay? I will not obey the commandment of the king, but the commandment of the law which was given us by Moses.
<br>31	But thou that hast been the author of all mischief against the Hebrews, shalt not escape the hand of God.
<br>32	For we suffer thus for our sins.
<br>33	And though the Lord, our God, is angry with us a little while, for our chastisement and correction, yet he will be reconciled again to his servants.
<br>34	But thou, O wicked, and of all men most flagitious, be not lifted up without cause with
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>vain hopes, whilst thou art raging against his servants.
<br>35	For thou hast not yet escaped the judgment of the Almighty God, who beholdeth all things. 36 For my brethren having now undergone a short pain, are under the covenant of eternal life: but thou, by the judgment of God, shalt receive
<br>just punishment for thy pride.
<br>37	But I, like my brethren, offer up my life and my body for the laws of our fathers: calling upon God to be speedily merciful to our nation, and that thou by torments and stripes mayst confess that he alone is God.
<br>38	But in me, and in my brethren, the wrath of the Almighty, which hath justly been brought upon all our nation, shall cease.
<br>39	Then the king being incensed with anger, raged against him more cruelly than all the rest, taking it grievously that he was mocked.
<br>40	So this man also died undefiled, wholly trusting in the Lord.
<br>41	And last of all, after the sons, the mother also was consumed.
<br>42	But now there is enough said of the sacri- fices and of the excessive cruelties.
<br>
<br>Chapter 8
<br>But Judas Machabeus, and they that were with him, went privately into the towns: and calling together their kinsmen and friends, and taking unto them such as continued in the Jews’ reli- gion, they assembled six thousand men.
<br>2	And they called upon the Lord, that he would look upon his people that was trodden down by all and would have pity on the temple, that was defiled by the wicked:
<br>3	That he would have pity also upon the city that was destroyed, that was ready to be made
<br> 
<br>even with the ground, and would hear the voice of the blood that cried to him:
<br>4	That he would remember also the most un- just deaths of innocent children, and the blas- phemies offered to his name, and would shew his indignation on this occasion.
<br>5	Now when Machabeus had gathered a multi- tude, he could not be withstood by the heathens: for the wrath of the Lord was turned into mercy. 6 So coming unawares upon the towns and cities, he set them on fire, and taking posses- sion of the most commodious places, he made
<br>no small slaughter of the enemies:
<br>7	And especially in the nights he went upon these expeditions, and the fame of his valour was spread abroad every where.
<br>8	Then Philip seeing that the man gained ground by little and little, and that things for the most part succeeded prosperously with him, wrote to Ptolemee, the governor of Celesyria and Phenicia, to send aid to the king’s affairs.
<br>9	And he with all speed sent Nicanor, the son of Patroclus, one of his special friends, giving him no fewer than twenty thousand armed men of different nations, to root out the whole race of the Jews, joining also with him Gorgias, a good soldier, and of great experience in matters of war.
<br>11	Wherefore he sent immediately to the cities upon the sea coast, to invite men together to buy up the Jewish slaves, promising that they should have ninety slaves for one talent, not reflecting on the vengeance which was to follow him from the Almighty.
<br>12	Now when Judas found that Nicanor was coming, he imparted to the Jews that were with him, that the enemy was at hand.
<br>13	And some of them being afraid, and dis- trusting the justice of God, fled away.
<br>14	Others sold all that they had left, and
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>withal besought the Lord, that he would deliver them from the wicked Nicanor, who had sold them before he came near them:
<br>15	And if not for their sakes, yet for the covenant that he had made with their fathers, and for the sake of his holy and glorious name that was invoked upon them.
<br>16	But Machabeus calling together seven thousand that were with him, exhorted them not to be reconciled to the enemies, nor to fear the multitude of the enemies who came wrongfully against them, but to fight manfully:
<br>17	Setting before their eyes the injury they had unjustly done the holy place, and also the injury they had done to the city, which had been shamefully abused, besides their destroying the ordinances of the fathers.
<br>18	For, said he, they trust in their weapons, and in their boldness: but we trust in the Almighty Lord, who at a beck can utterly de- stroy both them that come against us, and the whole world.
<br>19	Moreover, he put them in mind also of the helps their fathers had received from God: and how, under Sennacherib, a hundred and eighty- five thousand had been destroyed.
<br>20	And of the battle that they had fought against the Galatians, in Babylonia; how they, being in all but six thousand, when it came to the point, and the Macedonians, their companions, were at a stand, slew a hundred and twenty thou- sand, because of the help they had from heaven, and for this they received many favours.
<br>21	With these words they were greatly encour- aged and disposed even to die for the laws and their country.
<br>22	So he appointed his brethren captains over each division of his army; Simon, and Joseph, and Jonathan, giving to each one fifteen hundred men.
<br> 
<br>23	And after the holy book had been read to them by Esdras, and he had given them for a watchword, The help of God: himself leading the first band, he joined battle with Nicanor:
<br>24	And the Almighty being their helper, they slew above nine thousand men: and hav- ing wounded and disabled the greater part of Nicanor’s army, they obliged them to fly.
<br>25	And they took the money of them that came to buy them, and they pursued them on every side.
<br>26	But they came back for want of time: for it was the day before the sabbath: and therefore they did not continue the pursuit.
<br>27	But when they had gathered together their arms and their spoils, they kept the sabbath: blessing the Lord who had delivered them that day, distilling the beginning of mercy upon them. 28 Then after the sabbath they divided the spoils to the feeble and the orphans, and the widows, and the rest they took for themselves
<br>and their servants.
<br>29	When this was done, and they had all made a common supplication, they besought the mer- ciful Lord, to be reconciled to his servants unto the end.
<br>30	Moreover, they slew above twenty thou- sand of them that were with Timotheus and Bac- chides, who fought against them, and they made themselves masters of the high strong holds: and they divided amongst them many spoils, giving equal portions to the feeble, the fatherless, and the widows; yea, and the aged also
<br>31	And when they had carefully gathered to- gether their arms, they laid them all up in conve- nient places, and the residue of their spoils they carried to Jerusalem:
<br>32	They slew also Philarches, who was with Timotheus, a wicked man, who had many ways afflicted the Jews.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>33	And when they kept the feast of the victory at Jerusalem, they burnt Callisthenes, that had set fire to the holy gates, who had taken refuge in a certain house, rendering to him a worthy reward for his impieties:
<br>34	But as for that most wicked man, Nicanor, who had brought a thousand merchants to the sale of the Jews,
<br>35	Being, through the help of the Lord, brought down by them, of whom he had made no account, laying aside his garment of glory, flee- ing through the midland country, he came alone to Antioch, being rendered very unhappy by the destruction of his army.
<br>36	And he that had promised to levy the trib- ute for the Romans, by the means of the captives of Jerusalem, now professed that the Jews had God for their protector, and therefore they could not be hurt, because they followed the laws ap- pointed by him.
<br>
<br>Chapter 9
<br>At that time Antiochus returned with dishonour out of Persia.
<br>2	For he had entered into the city called Perse- polis, and attempted to rob the temple, and to oppress the city, but the multitude running to- gether to arms, put them to flight: and so it fell out that Antiochus being put to flight, returned with disgrace.
<br>3	Now when he was come about Ecbatana, he received the news of what had happened to Nicanor and Timotheus.
<br>4	And swelling with anger, he thought to re- venge upon the Jews the injury done by them that had put him to flight. And therefore he commanded his chariot to be driven, without stopping in his journey, the judgment of heaven
<br> 
<br>urging him forward, because he had spoken so proudly, that he would come to Jerusalem, and make it a common burying place of the Jews.
<br>5	But the Lord, the God of Israel, that seeth all things, struck him with an incurable and an invisible plague. For as soon as he had ended these words, a dreadful pain in his bowels came upon him, and bitter torments of the inner parts. 6 And indeed very justly, seeing he had tor- mented the bowels of others with many and new torments, albeit he by no means ceased from his
<br>malice.
<br>7	Moreover, being filled with pride, breathing out fire in his rage against the Jews, and com- manding the matter to be hastened, it happened as he was going with violence, that he fell from the chariot, so that his limbs were much pained by a grievous bruising of the body.
<br>8	Thus he that seemed to himself to command even the waves of the sea, being proud above the condition of man, and to weigh the heights of the mountains in a balance, now being cast down to the ground, was carried in a litter, bearing witness to the manifest power of God in himself: 9 So that worms swarmed out of the body of this man, and whilst he lived in sorrow and pain, his flesh fell off, and the filthiness of his smell was
<br>noisome to the army.
<br>10 And the man that thought a little before he could reach to the stars of heaven, no man could endure to carry, for the intolerable stench. 11 And by this means, being brought from his great pride, he began to come to the knowledge of himself, being admonished by the scourge of
<br>God, his pains increasing every moment.
<br>12	And when he himself could not now abide his own stench, he spoke thus: It is just to be subject to God, and that a mortal man should not equal himself to God.
<br>13	Then this wicked man prayed to the Lord,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>of whom he was not like to obtain mercy.
<br>14	And the city, to which he was going in haste to lay it even with the ground, and to make it a common burying place, he now desireth to make free:
<br>15	And the Jews, whom he said he would not account worthy to be so much as buried, but would give them up to be devoured by the birds and wild beasts, and would utterly destroy them with their children, he now promiseth to make equal with the Athenians.
<br>16	The holy temple also, which before he had spoiled, he promised to adorn with goodly gifts, and to multiply the holy vessels, and to allow out of his revenues the charges pertaining to the sacrifices.
<br>17	Yea also, that he would become a Jew him- self, and would go through every place of the earth, and declare the power of God.
<br>18	But his pains not ceasing, (for the just judgment of God was come upon him) despair- ing of life, he wrote to the Jews, in the manner of a supplication, a letter in these words:
<br>19	To his very good subjects the Jews, Anti- ochus, king and ruler, wisheth much health, and welfare, and happiness.
<br>20	If you and your children are well, and if all matters go with you to your mind, we give very great thanks.
<br>21	As for me, being infirm, but yet kindly re- membering you, returning out of the places of Persia, and being taken with a grievous disease, I thought it necessary to take care for the com- mon good:
<br>22	Not distrusting my life, but having great hope to escape the sickness.
<br>23	But considering that my father also, at what time he led an army into the higher coun- tries, appointed who should reign after him:
<br>24	To the end that if any thing contrary to
<br> 
<br>expectation should fall out, or any bad tidings should be brought, they that were in the coun- tries, knowing to whom the whole government was left, might not be troubled.
<br>25	Moreover, considering that neighbouring princes, and borderers, wait for opportunities, and expect what shall be the event, I have ap- pointed my son, Antiochus, king, whom I often recommended to many of you, when I went into the higher provinces: and I have written to him what I have joined here below.
<br>26	I pray you, therefore, and request of you, that, remembering favours both public and pri- vate, you will every man of you continue to be faithful to me and to my son.
<br>27	For I trust that he will behave with moder- ation and humanity, and following my intentions, will be gracious unto you.
<br>28	Thus the murderer and blasphemer being grievously struck, as himself had treated oth- ers, died a miserable death in a strange country, among the mountains.
<br>29	But Philip, that was brought up with him, carried away his body: and out of fear of the son of Antiochus, went into Egypt to Ptolemee Philometor.
<br>
<br>Chapter 10
<br>But Machabeus, and they that were with him, by the protection of the Lord, recovered the temple and the city again.
<br>2	But he threw down the altars which the hea- thens had set up in the streets, as also the tem- ples of the idols.
<br>3	And having purified the temple, they made another altar: and taking fire out of the fiery stones, they offered sacrifices after two years, and set forth incense, and lamps, and the loaves of
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>proposition.
<br>4	And when they had done these things, they besought the Lord, lying prostrate on the ground, that they might no more fall into such evils; but if they should at any time sin, that they might be chastised by him more gently, and not be delivered up to barbarians and blasphe- mous men.
<br>5	Now upon the same day that the temple had been polluted by the strangers on the very same day it was cleansed again; to wit, on the five and twentieth day of the month of Casleu.
<br>6	And they kept eight days with joy, after the manner of the feast of the tabernacles, remem- bering that not long before they had kept the feast of the tabernacles when they were in the mountains, and in dens like wild beasts.
<br>7	Therefore they now carried boughs and green branches and palms, for him that had given them good success in cleansing his place.
<br>8	And they ordained by a common statute, and decree, that all the nation of the Jews should keep those days every year.
<br>9	And this was the end of Antiochus, that was called the Illustrious.
<br>10	But now we will repeat the acts of Eupator, the son of that wicked Antiochus, abridging the account of the evils that happened in the wars.
<br>11	For when he was come to the crown, he appointed over the affairs of his realm one Lysias, general of the army of Phenicia and Syria.
<br>12	For Ptolemee, that was called Macer, was determined to be strictly just to the Jews and especially by reason of the wrong that had been done them, and to deal peaceably with them.
<br>13	But being accused for this to Eupator by his friends, and being oftentimes called traitor, because he had left Cyprus, which Philometor had committed to him, and coming over to An- tiochus the Illustrious, had revolted also from
<br> 
<br>him, he put an end to his life by poison.
<br>14	But Gorgias, who was governor of the holds, taking with him the strangers, often fought against the Jews.
<br>15	And the Jews that occupied the most com- modious holds, received those that were driven out of Jerusalem, and attempted to make war.
<br>16	Then they that were with Machabeus, be- seeching the Lord by prayers to be their helper, made a strong attack upon the strong holds of the Idumeans:
<br>17	And assaulting them with great force, won the holds, killed them that came in the way, and slew altogether no fewer than twenty thousand.
<br>18	And whereas some were fled into very strong towers, having all manner of provision to sustain a siege,
<br>19	Machabeus left Simon and Joseph, and Zacheus, and them that were with them, in suf- ficient number to besiege them, and departed to those expeditions which urged more.
<br>20	Now they that were with Simon, being led with covetousness, were persuaded for the sake of money by some that were in the towers: and taking seventy thousand didrachmas, let some of them escape.
<br>21	But when it was told Machabeus what was done, he assembled the rulers of the people, and accused those men that they had sold their brethren for money, having let their adversaries escape.
<br>22	So he put these traitors to death, and forth- with took the two towers.
<br>23	And having good success in arms, and all things he took in hand, he slew more than twenty thousand in the two holds.
<br>24	But Timotheus, who before had been over- come by the Jews, having called together a mul- titude of foreign troops, and assembled horsemen out of Asia, came as though he would take Judea
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>by force of arms.
<br>26 But Machabeus, and they that were with him, when he drew near, prayed to the Lord, sprinkling earth upon their heads, and girding their loins with haircloth,
<br>26	And lying prostrate at the foot of the altar, besought him to be merciful to them, and to be an enemy to their enemies, and an adversary to their adversaries, as the law saith.
<br>27	And so after prayer taking their arms, they went forth further from the city, and when they were come very near the enemies they rested.
<br>28	But as soon as the sun was risen both sides joined battle: the one part having, with their val- our, the Lord for a surety of victory, and success: but the other side making their rage their leader in battle.
<br>29	But when they were in the heat of the en- gagement, there appeared to the enemies from heaven five men upon horses, comely, with golden bridles, conducting the Jews:
<br>30	Two of them took Machabeus between them, and covered him on every side with their arms, and kept him safe; but cast darts and fire- balls against the enemy, so that they fell down, being both confounded with blindness, and filled with trouble.
<br>31	And there were slain twenty thousand five hundred, and six hundred horsemen.
<br>32	But Timotheus fled into Gazara, a strong hold where Chereas was governor.
<br>33	Then Machabeus, and they that were with him cheerfully laid siege to the fortress four days. 34 But they that were within, trusting to the strength of the place, blasphemed exceedingly,
<br>and cast forth abominable words.
<br>35	But when the fifth day appeared, twenty young men of them that were with Machabeus, inflamed in their minds, because of the blas- phemy, approached manfully to the wall, and
<br> 
<br>pushing forward with fierce courage, got up upon it:
<br>36	Moreover, others also getting up after them, went to set fire to the towers and the gates, and to burn the blasphemers alive.
<br>37	And having for two days together pillaged and sacked the fortress, they killed Timotheus, who was found hid in a certain place: they slew also his brother Chereas, and Apollophanes.
<br>38	And when this was done, they blessed the Lord with hymns and thanksgiving, who had done great things in Israel, and given them the victory.
<br>
<br>Chapter 11
<br>A short time after this Lysias, the king’s lieu- tenant, and cousin, and who had chief charge over all the affairs, being greatly displeased with what had happened,
<br>2	Gathered together fourscore thousand men, and all the horsemen, and came against the Jews, thinking to take the city, and make it a habita- tion of the Gentiles:
<br>3	And to make a gain of the temple, as of the other temples of the Gentiles and to set the high priesthood to sale every year:
<br>4	Never considering the power of God, but puffed up in mind, and trusting in the multi- tude of his foot soldiers, and the thousands of his horsemen, and his fourscore elephants.
<br>5	So he came into Judea, and approaching to Bethsura, which was in a narrow place, the space of five furlongs from Jerusalem, he laid siege to that fortress.
<br>6	But when Machabeus, and they that were with him, understood that the strong holds were besieged, they and all the people besought the Lord with lamentations and tears, that he would
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>send a good angel to save Israel.
<br>7	Then Machabeus himself first taking his arms, exhorted the rest to expose themselves to- gether with him, to the danger, and to succour their brethren.
<br>8	And when they were going forth together with a willing mind, there appeared at Jerusalem a horseman going before them in white clothing, with golden armour, shaking a spear.
<br>9	Then they all together blessed the merciful Lord, and took great courage: being ready to break through not only men, but also the fiercest beasts, and walls of iron.
<br>10	So they went on courageously, having a helper from heaven, and the Lord, who shewed mercy to them.
<br>11	And rushing violently upon the enemy, like lions, they slew of them eleven thousand foot- men, and one thousand six hundred horsemen:
<br>12	And put all the rest to flight; and many of them being wounded, escaped naked: Yea, and Lysias himself fled away shamefully, and es- caped.
<br>13	And as he was a man of understanding, considering with himself the loss he had suffered, and perceiving that the Hebrews could not be overcome, because they relied upon the help of the Almighty God, he sent to them:
<br>14	And promised that he would agree to all things that are just, and that he would persuade the king to be their friend.
<br>15	Then Machabeus consented to the request of Lysias, providing for the common good in all things; and whatsoever Machabeus wrote to Lysias, concerning the Jews, the king allowed of. 16 For there were letters written to the Jews from Lysias, to this effect: Lysias, to the people
<br>of the Jews, greeting.
<br>17 John, and Abesalom, who were sent from you, delivering your writings, requested that I
<br> 
<br>would accomplish those things which were signi- fied by them.
<br>18	Therefore whatsoever things could be re- ported to the king, I have represented to him: and he hath granted as much as the matter per- mitted.
<br>19	If, therefore, you will keep yourselves loyal in affairs, hereafter also I will endeavour to be a means of your good.
<br>20	But as concerning other particulars, I have given orders by word both to these, and to them that are sent by me, to commune with you.
<br>21	Fare ye well. In the year one hundred and forty-eight, the four and twentieth day of the month of Dioscorus.
<br>22	But the king’s letter contained these words King Antiochus to Lysias, his brother, greeting. 23 Our father being translated amongst the gods we are desirous that they that are in our realm should live quietly, and apply themselves
<br>diligently to their own concerns.
<br>24	And we have heard that the Jews would not consent to my father to turn to the rites of the Greeks but that they would keep to their own manner of living and therefore that they request us to allow them to live after their own laws.
<br>25	Wherefore being desirous that this nation also should be at rest, we have ordained and decreed, that the temple should be restored to them, and that they may live according to the custom of their ancestors.
<br>26	Thou shalt do well, therefore, to send to them, and grant them peace, that our pleasure being known, they may be of good comfort, and look to their own affairs.
<br>27	But the king’s letter to the Jews was in this manner: King Antiochus to the senate of the Jews, and to the rest of the Jews, greeting.
<br>28	If you are well, you are as we desire: we ourselves also are well.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>29	Menelaus came to us, saying that you de- sired to come down to your countrymen, that are with us.
<br>30	We grant, therefore, a safe conduct to all that come and go, until the thirtieth day of the month of Xanthicus,
<br>31	That the Jews may use their own kind of meats, and their own laws, as before: and that none of them any manner of ways be molested for things which have been done by ignorance.
<br>32	And we have sent also Menelaus to speak to you.
<br>33	Fare ye well. In the year one hundred and forty-eight, the fifteenth day of the month of Xanthicus.
<br>34	The Romans also sent them a letter, to this effect: Quintus Memmius, and Titus Manilius, ambassadors of the Romans, to the people of the Jews, greeting.
<br>35	Whatsoever Lysias, the king’s cousin, hath granted to you, we also have granted.
<br>36	But touching such things as he thought should be referred to the king, after you have diligently conferred among yourselves, send some one forthwith, that we may decree as it is con- venient for you: for we are going to Antioch.
<br>37	And therefore make haste to write back, that we may know of what mind you are.
<br>38	Fare ye well. In the year one hundred and forty-eight, the fifteenth day of the month of Xanthicus.
<br>
<br>Chapter 12
<br>When these covenants were made, Lysias went to the king, and the Jews gave themselves to husbandry.
<br>2	But they that were behind, viz. Timo- theus, and Apollonius, the son of Genneus, also
<br> 
<br>Hieronymus, and Demophon, and besides them Nicanor, the governor of Cyprus, would not suf- fer them to live in peace, and to be quiet.
<br>3	The men of Joppe also were guilty of this kind of wickedness: they desired the Jews, who dwelt among them, to go with their wives and children into the boats, which they had prepared, as though they had no enmity to them.
<br>4	Which when they had consented to, accord- ing to the common decree of the city, suspecting nothing, because of the peace: when they were gone forth into the deep, they drowned no fewer than two hundred of them.
<br>5	But as soon as Judas heard of this cruelty done to his countrymen, he commanded the men that were with him: and after having called upon God, the just judge,
<br>6	He came against those murderers of his brethren, and set the haven on fire in the night, burnt the boats, and slew with the sword them that escaped from the fire.
<br>7	And when he had done these things in this manner, he departed as if he would return again, and root out all the Joppites.
<br>8	But when he understood that the men of Jamnia also designed to do in like manner to the Jews that dwelt among them,
<br>9	He came upon the Jamnites also by night, and set the haven on fire, with the ships, so that the light of the fire was seen at Jerusalem, two hundred and forty furlongs off.
<br>10	And when they were now gone from thence nine furlongs, and were marching towards Tim- otheus, five thousand footmen, and five hundred horsemen of the Arabians, set upon them.
<br>11	And after a hard fight, in which, by the help of God, they got the victory, the rest of the Arabians being overcome, besought Judas for peace, promising to give him pastures, and to assist him in other things.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>12	And Judas thinking that they might be profitable indeed in many things, promised them peace, and after having joined hands, they de- parted to their tents.
<br>13	He also laid siege to a certain strong city, encompassed with bridges and walls, and inhab- ited by multitudes of different nations, the name of which is Casphin.
<br>14	But they that were within it, trusting in the strength of the walls, and the provision of victuals, behaved in a more negligent manner, and provoked Judas with railing and blasphem- ing, and uttering such words as were not to be spoken.
<br>15	But Machabeus calling upon the great Lord of the world, who without any rams or engines of war threw down the walls of Jericho, in the time of Josue, fiercely assaulted the walls.
<br>16	And having taken the city by the will of the Lord, he made an unspeakable slaughter, so that a pool adjoining, of two furlongs broad, seemed to run with the blood of the slain.
<br>17	From thence they departed seven hundred and fifty furlongs, and came to Characa, to the Jews that are called Tubianites.
<br>18	But as for Timotheus, they found him not in those places, for before he had dispatched any thing he went back, having left a very strong garrison in a certain hold:
<br>19	But Dositheus, and Sosipater, who were captains with Machabeus, slew them that were left by Timotheus in the hold, to the number of ten thousand men.
<br>20	And Machabeus having set in order about him six thousand men, and divided them by bands, went forth against Timotheus, who had with him a hundred and twenty thousand foot- men, aad two thousand five hundred horsemen. 21 Now when Timotheus had knowledge of the coming of Judas,  he sent the women and chil-
<br> 
<br>dren, and the other baggage, before him into a fortress, called Carnion: for it was impregnable, and hard to come at, by reason of the straitness of the places.
<br>22	But when the first band of Judas came in sight, the enemies were struck with fear, by the presence of God, who seeth all things, and they were put to flight one from another, so that they were often thrown down by their own compan- ions, and wounded with the strokes of their own swords.
<br>23	But Judas pursued them close, punishing the profane, of whom he slew thirty thousand men.
<br>24	And Timotheus himself fell into the hands of the band of Dositheus and Sosipater, and with many prayers he besought them to let him go with his life, because he had the parents and brethren of many of the Jews, who, by his death, might happen to be deceived.
<br>25	And when he had given his faith that he would restore them according to the agreement, they let him go without hurt, for the saving of their brethren.
<br>26	Then Judas went away to Carnion, where he slew five and twenty thousand persons.
<br>27	And after he had put to flight and de- stroyed these, he removed his army to Ephron, a strong city, wherein there dwelt a multitude of divers nations: and stout young men standing upon the walls, made a vigorous resistance: and in this place there were many engines of war, and a provision of darts.
<br>28	But when they had invocated the Almighty, who with his power breaketh the strength of the enemies, they took the city: and slew five and twenty thousand of them that were within.
<br>29	From thence they departed to Scythopolis, which lieth six hundred furlongs from Jerusalem.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>30	But the Jews that were among the Scythopolitans testifying that they were used kindly by them, and that even in the times of their adversity they had treated them with hu- manity:
<br>31	They gave them thanks, exhorting them to be still friendly to their nation, and so they came to Jerusalem, the feast of the weeks being at hand.
<br>32	And after Pentecost they marched against Gorgias, the governor of Idumea.
<br>33	And he came out with three thousand foot- men and four hundred horsemen.
<br>34	And when they had joined battle, it hap- pened that a few of the Jews were slain.
<br>35	But Dositheus, a horseman, one of Ba- cenor’s band, a valiant man, took hold of Gor- gias: and when he would have taken him alive, a certain horseman of the Thracians came upon him, and cut off his shoulder: and so Gorgias escaped to Maresa.
<br>36	But when they that were with Esdrin had fought long, and were weary, Judas called upon the Lord to be their helper, and leader of the battle:
<br>37	Then beginning in his own language, and singing hymns with a loud voice, he put Gor- gias’s soldiers to flight.
<br>38	So Judas having gathered together his army, came into the city Odollam: and when the seventh day came, they purified themselves according to the custom, and kept the sabbath in the same place.
<br>39	And the day following Judas came with his company, to take away the bodies of them that were slain, and to bury them with their kinsmen, in the sepulchres of their fathers.
<br>40	And they found under the coats of the slain, some of the donaries of the idols of Jamnia, which the law forbiddeth to the Jews: so that all
<br> 
<br>plainly saw, that for this cause they were slain. 41 Then they all blessed the just judgment of the Lord, who had discovered the things that
<br>were hidden.
<br>42	And so betaking themselves to prayers, they besought him, that the sin which had been committed might be forgotten. But the most valiant Judas exhorted the people to keep them- selves from sin, forasmuch as they saw before their eyes what had happened, because of the sins of those that were slain.
<br>43	And making a gathering, he sent twelve thousand drachms of silver to Jerusalem for sac- rifice to be offered for the sins of the dead, think- ing well and religiously concerning the resurrec- tion.
<br>44	(For if he had not hoped that they that were slain should rise again, it would have seemed superfluous and vain to pray for the dead,)
<br>45	And because he considered that they who had fallen asleep with godliness, had great grace laid up for them.
<br>46	It is therefore a holy and wholesome thought to pray for the dead, that they may be loosed from sins.
<br>
<br>Chapter 13
<br>In the year one hundred and forty-nine, Judas understood that Antiochus Eupator was coming with a multitude against Judea,
<br>2	And with him Lysias, the regent, who had charge over the affairs of the realm, having with him a hundred and ten thousand footmen, five thousand horsemen, twenty-two elephants, and three hundred chariots.
<br>3	Menelaus also joined himself with them: and with great deceitfulness besought Antiochus, not
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>for the welfare of his country, but in hopes that he should be appointed chief ruler.
<br>4	But the King of kings stirred up the mind of Antiochus against the sinner, and upon Lysias suggesting that he was the cause of all the evils, he commanded (as the custom is with them) that he should be apprehended and put to death in the same place.
<br>5	Now there was in that place a tower fifty cubits high, having a heap of ashes on every side: this had a prospect steep down.
<br>6	From thence he commanded the sacrilegious wretch to be thrown down into the ashes, all men thrusting him forward unto death.
<br>7	And by such a law it happened that Menelaus the transgressor of the law, was put to death: not having so much as burial in the earth.
<br>8	And indeed very justly, for insomuch as he had committed many sins against the altar of God, the fire and ashes of which were holy: he was condemned to die in ashes.
<br>9	But the king, with his mind full of rage, came on to shew himself worse to the Jews than his father was.
<br>10	Which when Judas understood, he com- manded the people to call upon the Lord day and night, that as he had always done, so now also he would help them:
<br>11	Because they were afraid to be deprived of the law, and of their country, and of the holy temple: and that he would not suffer the people, that had of late taken breath for a little while, to be again in subjection to blasphemous nations.
<br>12	So when they had all done this together, and had craved mercy of the Lord with weeping and fasting, lying prostrate on the ground for three days continually, Judas exhorted them to make themselves ready.
<br>13	But he, with the ancients, determined be-
<br> 
<br>fore the king should bring his army into Judea, and make himself master of the city, to go out, and to commit the event of the thing to the judg- ment of the Lord.
<br>14	So committing all to God, the Creator of the world, and having exhorted his people to fight manfully, and to stand up even to death for the laws, the temple, the city, their country, and citizens: he placed his army about Modin.
<br>15	And having given his company for a watch- word, The victory of God, with most valiant cho- sen young men, he set upon the king’s quarter by night, and slew four thousand men in the camp, and the greatest of the elephants, with them that had been upon him,
<br>16	And having filled the camp of the enemies with exceeding great fear and tumult, they went off with good success.
<br>17	Now this was done at the break of day, by the protection and help of thc Lord.
<br>18	But the king having taken a taste of the hardiness of the Jews, attempted to take the strong places by policy:
<br>19	And he marched with his army to Beth- sura, which was a strong hold of the Jews: but he was repulsed, he failed, he lost his men.
<br>20	Now Judas sent necessaries to them that were within
<br>21	But Rhodocus, one of the Jews’ army, dis- closed the secrets to the enemies, so he was sought out, and taken up, and put iu prison.
<br>22	Again the king treated with them that were in Bethsura: gave his right hand: took theirs: and went away.
<br>23	He fought with Judas: and was overcome. And when he understood that Philip, who had been left over the affairs, had rebelled at An- tioch, he was in a consternation of mind, and intreating the Jews, and yielding to them, he swore to all things that seemed reasonable, and,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>being reconciled, offered sacrifice, honoured the temple, and left gifts.
<br>24	He embraced Machabeus, and made him governor and prince from Ptolemais unto the Gerrenians.
<br>25	But when he was come to Ptolemais, the men of that city were much displeased with the conditions of the peace, being angry for fear they should break the covenant.
<br>26	Then Lysias went up to the judgment seat, and set forth the reason, and appeased the peo- ple, and returned to Antioch: and thus matters went with regard to the king’s coming and his return.
<br>
<br>Chapter 14
<br>But after the space of three years Judas, and they that were with him, understood that Demetrius, the son of Seleucus, was come up with a great power, and a navy by the haven of Tripolis, to places proper for his purpose,
<br>2 And had made himself master of the coun- tries against Antiochus, and his general, Lysias. 3 Now one Alcimus, who had been chief priest, but had wilfully defiled himself in the time of mingling with the heathens, seeing that there
<br>was no safety for him, nor access to the altar,
<br>4	Came to king Demetrius in the year one hundred and fifty, presenting unto him a crown of gold, and a palm, and besides these, some boughs that seemed to belong to the temple. And that day indeed he held his peace.
<br>5	But having gotten a convenient time to fur- ther his madness, being called to counsel by Demetrius, and asked what the Jews relied upon, and what were their counsels,
<br>6	He answered thereunto: They among the Jews that are called Assideans, of whom Judas
<br> 
<br>Machabeus is captain, nourish wars, and raise seditions, and will not suffer the realm to be in peace.
<br>7	For I also being deprived of my ancestor’s glory (I mean of the high priesthood) am now come hither:
<br>8	Principally indeed out of fidelity to the king’s interests, but in the next place also to pro- vide for the good of my countrymen: for all our nation suffereth much from the evil proceedings of these men.
<br>9	Wherefore, O king, seeing thou knowest all these things, take care, I beseech thee, both of the country, and of our nation, according to thy humanity which is known to all men.
<br>10	For as long as Judas liveth it is not possible that the state should be quiet.
<br>11	Now when this man had spoken to this ef- fect the rest also of the king’s friends, who were enemies of Judas, incensed Demetrius against him.
<br>12	And forthwith he sent Nicanor, the com- mander over the elephants, governor into Judea: 13 Giving him in charge, to take Judas him- self: and disperse all them that were with him, and to make Alcimus the high priest of the great
<br>temple.
<br>14	Then the Gentiles who had fled out of Judea, from Judas, came to Nicanor by flocks, thinking the miseries and calamities of the Jews to be the welfare of their affairs.
<br>15	Now when the Jews heard of Nicanor’s coming, and that the nations were assembled against them, they cast earth upon their heads, and made supplication to him who chose his peo- ple to keep them for ever, and who protected his portion by evident signs.
<br>16	Then at the commandment of their cap- tain, they forthwith removed from the place where they were, and went to the town of
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Dessau, to meet them.
<br>17	Now Simon, the brother of Judas, had joined battle with Nicanor: but was frightened with the sudden coming of the adversaries.
<br>18	Nevertheless Nicanor hearing of the val- our of Judas’s companions, and the greatness of courage, with which they fought for their coun- try, was afraid to try the matter by the sword.
<br>19	Wherefore he sent Posidonius, and Theodotius and Matthias before to present and receive the right hands.
<br>20	And when there had been a consultation thereupon, and the captain had acquainted the multitude with it, they were all of one mind to consent to covenants.
<br>21	So they appointed a day upon which they might comne together by themselves: and seats were brought out, and set for each one.
<br>22	But Judas ordered armed men to be ready in convenient places, lest some mischief might be suddenly practised by the enemies: so they made an agreeable conference.
<br>23	And Nicanor abode in Jerusalem, and did no wrong, but sent away the flocks of the multi- tudes that had been gathered together.
<br>24	And Judas was always dear to him from the heart, and he was well affected to the man.
<br>25	And he desired him to marry a wife, and to have children. So he married: he lived quietly, and they lived in common.
<br>26	But Alcimus seeing the love they had one to another, and the covenants, came to Demetrius, and told him that Nicanor had assented to the foreign interest, for that he meant to make Ju- das, who was a traitor to the kingdom, his suc- cessor.
<br>27	Then the king, being in a rage, and pro- voked with this man’s wicked accusation, wrote to Nicanor, signifying that he was greatly dis- pleased with the covenant of friendship: and that
<br> 
<br>he commanded him nevertheless to send Mach- abeus prisoner in all haste to Antioch.
<br>28	When this was known, Nicanor was in a consternation, and took it grievously that he should make void the articles that were agreed upon, having received no injury from the man.
<br>29	But because he could not oppose the king, he watched an opportunity to comply with the orders
<br>30	But when Machabeus perceived that Nicanor was more stern to him, and that when they met together as usual he behaved himself in a rough manner; and was sensible that this rough behaviour came not of good, he gathered together a few of his men, and hid himself from Nicanor.
<br>31	But he finding himself notably prevented by the man, came to the great and holy tem- ple: and commanded the priests that were offer- ing the accustomed sacrifices, to deliver him the man.
<br>32	And when they swore unto him, that they knew not where the man was whom he sought, he stretched out his hand to the temple,
<br>33	And swore, saying: Unless you deliver Ju- das prisoner to me, I will lay this temple of God even with the ground, and will beat down the al- tar, and I will dedicate this temple to Bacchus.
<br>34	And when he had spoken thus, he departed. But the priests stretching forth their hands to heaven, called upon him that was ever the de- fender of their nation, saying in this manner:
<br>35	Thou, O Lord of all things, who wantest nothing, wast pleased that the temple of thy habitation should be amongst us.
<br>36	Therefore now, O Lord, the holy of all holies, keep this house for ever undefiled, which was lately cleansed.
<br>37	Now Razias, one of the ancients of Jerusalem, was accused to Nicanor, a man that
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>was a lover of the city, and of good report, who for his kindness was called the father of the Jews. 38 This man, for a long time, had held fast his purpose of keeping himself pure in the Jews’ religion, and was ready to expose his body and
<br>life, that he might persevere therein.
<br>39	So Nicanor being willing to declare the ha- tred that he bore the Jews, sent five hundred soldiers to take him.
<br>40	For he thought by ensnaring him to hurt the Jews very much.
<br>41	Now as the multitude sought to rush into his house, and to break open the door, and to set fire to it, when he was ready to be taken, he struck himself with his sword:
<br>42	Choosing to die nobly rather than to fall into the hands of the wicked, and to suffer abuses unbecoming his noble birth.
<br>43	But whereas through haste he missed of giving a sure wound, and the crowd was breaking into the doors, he ran boldly to the wall, and manfully threw himself down to the crowd:
<br>44	But they quickly making room for his fall, he came upon the midst of the neck.
<br>45	And as he had yet breath in him, being in- flamed in mind, he arose: and while his blood ran down with a great stream, and he was grievously wounded, he ran through the crowd:
<br>46	And standing upon a steep rock, when he was now almost without blood, grasping his bowels, with both hands he cast them upon the throng, calling upon the Lord of life and spirit, to restore these to him again: and so he departed this life.
<br>
<br>Chapter 15
<br>But when Nicanor understood that Judas was in the places of Samaria, he purposed to set upon
<br> 
<br>him with all violence, on the sabbath day.
<br>2	And when the Jews that were constrained to follow him, said: Do not act so fiercely and barbarously, but give honour to the day that is sanctified: and reverence him that beholdeth all things:
<br>3	That unhappy man asked, if there were a mighty One in heaven, that had commanded the sabbath day to be kept.
<br>4	And when they answered: There is the living Lord himself in heaven, the mighty One, that commanded the seventh day to be kept.
<br>5	Then he said: And I am mighty upon the earth, and I command to take arms, and to do the king’s business. Nevertheless he prevailed not to accomplish his design.
<br>6	So Nicanor being puffed up with exceeding great pride, thought to set up a public monument of his victory over Judas.
<br>7	But Machabeus ever trusted with all hope that God would help them.
<br>8	And he exhorted his people not to fear the coming of the nations, but to remember the help they had before received from heaven, and now to hope for victory from the Almighty.
<br>9	And speaking to them out of the law, and the prophets, and withal putting them in mind of the battles they had fought before, he made them more cheerful:
<br>10	Then after he had encouraged them, he shewed withal the falsehood of the Gentiles, and their breach of oaths.
<br>11	So he armed every one of them, not with defence of shield and spear, but with very good speeches, and exhortations, and told them a dream worthy to be believed, whereby he re- joiced them all.
<br>12	Now the vision was in this manner. Onias, who had been high priest, a good and virtuous man, modest in his looks, gentle in his manners,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>and graceful in speech, and who from a child was exercised in virtues holding up his hands, prayed for all the people of the Jews:
<br>13	After this there appeared also another man, admirable for age, and glory, and environed with great beauty and majesty:
<br>14	Then Onias answering, said: This is a lover of his brethren, and of the people of Israel: this is he that prayeth much for the people, and for all the holy city, Jeremias, the prophet of God.
<br>15	Whereupon Jeremias stretched forth his right hand, and gave to Judas a sword of gold, saying:
<br>16	Take this holy sword, a gift from God, wherewith thou shalt overthrow the adversaries of my people Israel.
<br>17	Thus being exhorted with the words of Ju- das, which were very good, and proper to stir up the courage, and strengthen the hearts of the young men, they resolved to fight, and to set upon them manfully: that valour might decide the matter, because the holy city, and the temple were in danger.
<br>18	For their concern was less for their wives, and children, and for their brethren, and kins- folks: but their greatest and principal fear was for the holiness of the temple.
<br>19	And they also that were in the city, had no little concern for them that were to be engaged in battle.
<br>20	And now when all expected what judgment would be given, and the enemies were at hand, and the army was set in array, the beasts and the horsemen ranged in convenient places,
<br>21	Machabeus considering the coming of the multitude, and the divers preparations of ar- mour, and the fierceness of the beasts, stretch- ing out his hands to heaven, called upon the Lord, that worketh wonders, who giveth victory to them that are worthy,  not according to the
<br> 
<br>power of their arms, but according as it seemeth good to him.
<br>22	And in his prayer he said after this manner: Thou, O Lord, who didst send thy angel in the time of Ezechias, king of Juda, and didst kill a hundred and eighty-five thousand of the army of Sennacherib:
<br>23	Send now also, O Lord of heaven, thy good angel before us, for the fear and dread of the greatness of thy arm,
<br>24	That they may be afraid, who come with blasphemy against thy holy people. And thus he concluded his prayer.
<br>25	But Nicanor, and they that were with him came forward, with trumpets and songs.
<br>26	But Judas,  and they that were with him, encountered them, calling upon God by prayers: 27 So fighting with their hands, but praying to the Lord with their hearts, they slew no less than five and thirty thousand, being greatly cheered
<br>with the presence of God.
<br>28	And when the battle was over, and they were returning with joy, they understood that Nicanor was slain in his armour.
<br>29	Then making a shout, and a great noise, they blessed the Almighty Lord in their own lan- guage.
<br>30	And Judas, who was altogether ready, in body and mind, to die for his countrymen, com- manded that Nicanor’s head, and his hand, with the shoulder, should be cut off, and carried to Jerusalem.
<br>31	And when he was come thither, having called together his countrymen, and the priests to the altar, he sent also for them that were in the castle,
<br>32	And shewing them the head of Nicanor, and the wicked hand, which he had stretched out, with proud boasts, against the holy house of the Almighty God,
<br> 
<br>
<br>33	He commanded also, that the tongue of the wicked Nicanor should be cut out, and given by pieces to birds, and the hand of the furious man to be hanged up over against the temple.
<br>34	Then all blessed the Lord of heaven, say- ing: Blessed be he that hath kept his own place undefiled.
<br>35	And he hung up Nicanor’s head in the top of the castle, that it might be an evident and manifest sign of the help of God.
<br>36	And they all ordained by a common de- cree, by no means to let this day pass without solemnity:
<br>37	But to celebrate the thirteenth day of the month of Adar, called in the Syrian language, the day before Mardochias’ day.
<br>38	So these things being done with relation to Nicanor, and from that time the city being possessed by the Hebrews, I also will here make an end of my narration.
<br>39	Which if I have done well, and as it be- cometh the history, it is what I desired: but if not so perfectly, it must be pardoned me.
<br>40	For as it is hurtful to drink always wine, or always water, but pleasant to use sometimes the one, and sometimes the other: so if the speech be always nicely framed, it will not be grateful to the readers. But here it shall be ended.

<br>The Holy Gospel Of Jesus Christ, According to St. Matthew
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham:
<br>2	Abraham begot Isaac. And Isaac begot Ja- cob. And Jacob begot Judas and his brethren.
<br>3	And Judas begot Phares and Zara of Thamar. And Phares begot Esron. And Esron begot Aram.
<br>4	And Aram begot Aminadab. And Am- inadab begot Naasson. And Naasson begot Salmon.
<br>5	And Salmon begot Booz of Rahab. And Booz begot Obed of Ruth. And Obed begot Jesse.
<br>6	And Jesse begot David the king. And David the king begot Solomon, of her that had been the wife of Urias.
<br>7	And Solomon begot Roboam. And Roboam begot Abia. And Abia begot Asa.
<br>8	And Asa begot Josaphat. And Josaphat be- got Joram. And Joram begot Ozias.
<br>9	And Ozias begot Joatham. And Joatham begot Achaz. And Achaz begot Ezechias.
<br>10	And Ezechias begot Manasses. And Manesses begot Amon. And Amon begot Josias.
<br>11	And Josias begot Jechonias and his brethren in the transmigration of Babylon.
<br>12	And after the transmigration of Babylon,
<br> 
<br>Jechonias begot Salathiel. And Salathiel begot Zorobabel.
<br>13	And Zorobabel begot Abiud. And Abiud begot Eliacim. And Eliacim begot Azor.
<br>14	And Azor begot Sadoc. And Sadoc begot Achim. And Achim begot Eliud.
<br>15	And Eliud begot Eleazar. And Eleazar be- got Mathan. And Mathan begot Jacob.
<br>16	And Jacob begot Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.
<br>17	So all the generations, from Abraham to David, are fourteen generations. And from David to the transmigration of Babylon, are fourteen generations: and from the transmigra- tion of Babylon to Christ are fourteen genera- tions.
<br>18	Now the generation of Christ was in this wise.   When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child, of the Holy Ghost.
<br>19	Whereupon Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing publicly to expose her, was minded to put her away privately.
<br>20	But while he thought on these things, be- hold the angel of the Lord appeared to him in his sleep, saying: Joseph, son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife, for that which is conceived in her, is of the Holy Ghost.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>21	And she shall bring forth a son: and thou shalt call his name JESUS. For he shall save his people from their sins.
<br>22	Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which the Lord spoke by the prophet, saying:
<br>23	Behold a virgin shall be with child, and bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.
<br>24	And Joseph rising up from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him, and took unto him his wife.
<br>25	And he knew her not till she brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.
<br>
<br>Chapter 2
<br>When Jesus therefore was born in Bethlehem of Juda, in the days of king Herod, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem.
<br>2	Saying, Where is he that is born king of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the east, and are come to adore him.
<br>3	And king Herod hearing this, was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
<br>4	And assembling together all the chief priests and the scribes of the people, he inquired of them where Christ should be born.
<br>5	But they said to him: In Bethlehem of Juda.
<br>For so it is written by the prophet:
<br>6	And thou Bethlehem the land of Juda art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come forth the captain that shall rule my people Israel.
<br>7	Then Herod, privately calling the wise men, learned diligently of them the time of the star which appeared to them;
<br>8	And sending them into Bethlehem, said: Go
<br> 
<br>and diligently inquire after the child, and when you have found him, bring me word again, that I also may come to adore him.
<br>9	Who having heard the king, went their way; and behold the star which they had seen in the east, went before them, until it came and stood over where the child was.
<br>10	And seeing the star they rejoiced with ex- ceeding great joy.
<br>11	And entering into the house, they found the child with Mary his mother, and falling down they adored him; and opening their treasures, they offered him gifts; gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
<br>12	And having received an answer in sleep that they should not return to Herod, they went back another way into their country.
<br>13	And after they were departed, behold an angel of the Lord appeared in sleep to Joseph, saying: Arise, and take the child and his mother, and fly into Egypt: and be there until I shall tell thee. For it will come to pass that Herod will seek the child to destroy him.
<br>14	Who arose, and took the child and his mother by night, and retired into Egypt: and he was there until the death of Herod:
<br>15	That it might be fulfilled which the Lord spoke by the prophet, saying: Out of Egypt have I called my son.
<br>16	Then Herod perceiving that he was deluded by the wise men, was exceeding angry; and send- ing killed all the men children that were in Beth- lehem, and in all the borders thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men.
<br>17	Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremias the prophet, saying:
<br>18	A voice in Rama was heard, lamentation and great mourning; Rachel bewailing her chil- dren, and would not be comforted, because they
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>are not.
<br>19	But when Herod was dead, behold an angel of the Lord appeared in sleep to Joseph in Egypt, 20 Saying: Arise, and take the child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel. For they
<br>are dead that sought the life of the child.
<br>21	Who arose, and took the child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.
<br>22	But hearing that Archelaus reigned in Judea in the room of Herod his father, he was afraid to go thither: and being warned in sleep retired into the quarters of Galilee.
<br>23	And coming he dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was said by prophets: That he shall be called a Nazarene.
<br>
<br>Chapter 3
<br>
<br>And in those days cometh John the Baptist preaching in the desert of Judea.
<br>2	And saying: Do penance: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
<br>3	For this is he that was spoken of by Isaias the prophet, saying: A voice of one crying in the desert, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight his paths.
<br>4	And the same John had his garment of camels’ hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins: and his meat was locusts and wild honey.
<br>5	Then went out to him Jerusalem and all Judea, and all the country about Jordan:
<br>6	And were baptized by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.
<br>7	And seeing many of the Pharisees and Sad- ducees coming to his baptism, he said to them: Ye brood of vipers, who hath shewed you to flee from the wrath to come?
<br> 
<br>8	Bring forth therefore fruit worthy of penance.
<br>9	And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for our father. For I tell you that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.
<br>10	For now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that doth not yield good fruit, shall be cut down, and cast into the fire.
<br>11	I indeed baptize you in the water unto penance, but he that shall come after me, is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear; he shall baptize you in the Holy Ghost and fire.
<br>12	Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thor- oughly cleanse his floor and gather his wheat into the barn; but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.
<br>13	Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to the Jor- dan, unto John, to be baptized by him.
<br>14	But John stayed him, saying: I ought to be baptized by thee, and comest thou to me?
<br>15	And Jesus answering, said to him: Suffer it to be so now. For so it becometh us to fulfill all justice. Then he suffered him.
<br>16	And Jesus being baptized, forthwith came out of the water: and lo, the heavens were opened to him: and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him.
<br>17	And behold a voice from heaven, saying: This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
<br>
<br>Chapter 4
<br>
<br>Then Jesus was led by the spirit into the desert, to be tempted by the devil.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>2	And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, afterwards he was hungry.
<br>3	And the tempter coming said to him: If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.
<br>4	Who answered and said: It is written, Not in bread alone doth man live, but in every word that proceedeth from the mouth of God.
<br>5	Then the devil took him up into the holy city, and set him upon the pinnacle of the temple, 6 And said to him: If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down, for it is written: That he hath given his angels charge over thee, and in their hands shall they bear thee up, lest perhaps thou
<br>dash thy foot against a stone.
<br>7	Jesus said to him: It is written again: Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.
<br>8	Again the devil took him up into a very high mountain, and shewed him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them,
<br>9	And said to him: All these will I give thee, if falling down thou wilt adore me.
<br>10	Then Jesus saith to him: Begone, Satan: for it is written, The Lord thy God shalt thou adore, and him only shalt thou serve.
<br>11	Then the devil left him; and behold angels came and ministered to him.
<br>12	And when Jesus had heard that John was delivered up, he retired into Galilee:
<br>13	And leaving the city Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capharnaum on the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim;
<br>14	That it might be fulfilled which was said by Isaias the prophet:
<br>15	Land of Zabulon and land of Nephthalim, the way of the sea beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles:
<br>16	The people that sat in darkness, hath seen great light: and to them that sat in the region of the shadow of death, light is sprung up.
<br> 
<br>17	From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say: Do penance, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
<br>18	And Jesus walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea (for they were fishers).
<br>19	And he saith to them: Come ye after me, and I will make you to be fishers of men.
<br>20	And they immediately leaving their nets, followed him.
<br>21	And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets: and he called them. 22 And they forthwith left their nets and fa-
<br>ther, and followed him.
<br>23	And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom: and healing all manner of sickness and every infirmity, among the people.
<br>24	And his fame went throughout all Syria, and they presented to him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and such as were possessed by devils, and lu- natics, and those that had palsy, and he cured them:
<br>25	And much people followed him from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judea, and   from   be- yond the Jordan.
<br>
<br>Chapter 5
<br>And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain, and when he was set down, his disci- ples came unto him.
<br>2 And opening his mouth, he taught them, saying:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>3	Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
<br>4	Blessed are the meek: for they shall possess the land.
<br>5	Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.
<br>6	Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after justice: for they shall have their fill.
<br>7	Blessed are the merciful: for they shall ob- tain mercy.
<br>8	Blessed are the clean of heart: for they shall see God.
<br>9	Blesses are the peacemakers: for they shall be called children of God.
<br>10	Blessed are they that suffer persecution for justice’ sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 11 Blessed are ye when they shall revile you, and persecute you, and speak all that is evil
<br>against you, untruly, for my sake:
<br>12	Be glad and rejoice, for your reward is very great in heaven. For so they persecuted the prophets that were before you.
<br>13	You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt lose its savour, wherewith shall it be salted? It is good for nothing any more but to be cast out, and to be trodden on by men.
<br>14	You are the light of the world. A city seated on a mountain cannot be hid.
<br>15	Neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel, but upon a candlestick, that it may shine to all that are in the house.
<br>16	So let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.
<br>17	Do not think that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets. I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.
<br>18	For amen I say unto you, till heaven and earth pass, one jot, or one tittle shall not pass of the law, till all be fulfilled.
<br> 
<br>19	He therefore that shall break one of these least commandments, and shall so teach men, shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven. But he that shall do and teach, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
<br>20	For I tell you, that unless your justice abound more than that of the scribes and Phar- isees, you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.
<br>21	You have heard that it was said to them of old: Thou shalt not kill. And whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment.
<br>22	But I say to you, that whosoever is angry with his brother, shall be in danger of the judg- ment. And whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council. And whosoever shall say, Thou Fool, shall be in dan- ger of hell fire.
<br>23	If therefore thou offer thy gift at the altar, and there thou remember that thy brother hath any thing against thee;
<br>24	Leave there thy offering before the altar, and go first to be reconciled to thy brother: and then coming thou shalt offer thy gift.
<br>25	Be at agreement with thy adversary be- times, whilst thou art in the way with him: lest perhaps the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.
<br>26	Amen I say to thee, thou shalt not go out from thence till thou repay last farthing.
<br>27	You have heard that it was said to them of old: Thou shalt not commit adultery.
<br>28	But I say to you, that whosoever shall look on a woman to lust after her, hath already com- mitted adultery with her in his heart.
<br>29	And if thy right eye scandalize thee, pluck it out and cast it from thee. For it is expedient for thee that one of thy members should perish, rather than that thy whole body be cast into
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>hell.
<br>30	And if thy right hand scandalize thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is expedient for thee that one of thy members should perish, rather than that thy whole body be cast into hell.
<br>31	And it hath been said, Whoseoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a bill of di- vorce.
<br>32	But I say to you, that whosoever shall put away his wife, excepting for the cause of forni- cation, maketh her to commit adultery: and he that shall marry her that is put away, commit- teth adultery.
<br>33	Again you have heard that it was said to them of old, Thou shalt not forswear thyself: but thou shalt perform thy oaths to the Lord.
<br>34	But I say to you not to swear at all, neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God:
<br>35	Nor by the earth, for it is his footstool: nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great king: 36 Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, be- cause thou canst not make one hair white or
<br>black.
<br>37	But let your speech be yea, yea: no, no: and that which is over and above these, is of evil.
<br>38	You have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.
<br>39	But I say to you not to resist evil: but if one strike thee on thy right cheek, turn to him also the other:
<br>40	And if a man will contend with thee in judgment, and take away thy coat, let go thy cloak also unto him.
<br>41	And whosoever will force thee one mile, go with him other two,
<br>42	Give to him that asketh of thee and from him that would borrow of thee turn not away.
<br> 
<br>43	You have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thy en- emy.
<br>44	But I say to you, Love your enemies: do good to them that hate you: and pray for them that persecute and calumniate you:
<br>45	That you may be the children of your Fa- ther who is in heaven, who maketh his sun to rise upon the good, and bad, and raineth upon the just and the unjust.
<br>46	For if you love them that love you, what reward shall you have? do not even the publicans this?
<br>47	And if you salute your brethren only, what do you more? do not also the heathens this?
<br>48	Be you therefore perfect, as also your heav- enly Father is perfect.
<br>
<br>Chapter 6
<br>Take heed that you do not your justice before men, to be seen by them: otherwise you shall not have a reward of your Father who is in heaven.
<br>2	Therefore when thou dost an almsdeed, sound not a trumpet before thee, as the hyp- ocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be honoured by men. Amen I say to you, they have received their reward.
<br>3	But when thou dost alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth.
<br>4	That thy alms may be in secret, and thy Father who seeth in secret will repay thee.
<br>5	And when ye pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites, that love to stand and pray in the synagogues and corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men: Amen I say to you, they have received their reward.
<br>6	But thou when thou shalt pray, enter into thy chamber, and having shut the door, pray to
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>thy Father in secret: and thy Father who seeth in secret will repay thee.
<br>7	And when you are praying, speak not much, as the heathens. For they think that in their much speaking they may be heard.
<br>8	Be not you therefore like to them, for your Father knoweth what is needful for you, before you ask him.
<br>9	Thus therefore shall you pray: Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
<br>10	Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
<br>11	Give us this day our supersubstantial bread.
<br>12	And forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.
<br>13	And lead us not into temptation. But de- liver us from evil. Amen.
<br>14	For if you will forgive men their offences, your heavenly Father will forgive you also your offences.
<br>15	But if you will not forgive men, neither will your Father forgive you your offences.
<br>16	And when you fast, be not as the hyp- ocrites, sad. For they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Amen I say to you, they have received their reward.
<br>17	But thou, when thou fastest anoint thy head, and wash thy face;
<br>18	That thou appear not to men to fast, but to thy Father who is in secret: and thy Father who seeth in secret, will repay thee.
<br>19	Lay not up to yourselves treasures on earth: where the rust, and moth consume, and where thieves break through and steal.
<br>20	But lay up to yourselves treasures in heaven: where neither the rust nor   moth doth consume, and where thieves do not break through, nor steal.
<br> 
<br>21	For where thy treasure is, there is thy heart also.
<br>22	The light of thy body is thy eye. If thy eye be single, thy whole body shall be lightsome.
<br>23	But if thy eye be evil thy whole body shall be darksome. If then the light that is in thee, be darkness: the darkness itself how great shall it be!
<br>24	No man can serve two masters. For either he will hate the one, and love the other: or he will sustain the one, and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.
<br>25	Therefore I say to you, be not solicitous for your life, what you shall eat, nor for your body, what you shall put on. Is not the life more than the meat: and the body more than the raiment? 26 Behold the birds of the air, for they neither sow, nor do they reap, nor gather into barns: and your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are not you
<br>of much more value than they?
<br>27	And which of you by taking thought, can add to his stature by one cubit?
<br>28	And for raiment why are you solicitous? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they labour not, neither do they spin.
<br>29	But I say to you, that not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these.
<br>30	And if the grass of the field, which is to day, and to morrow is cast into the oven, God doth so clothe: how much more you, O ye of little faith? 31 Be not solicitous therefore, saying, What shall we eat: or what shall we drink, or where-
<br>with shall we be clothed?
<br>32	For after all these things do the heathens seek. For your Father knoweth that you have need of all these things.
<br>33	Seek ye therefore first the kingdom of God, and his justice, and all these things shall be added unto you.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>34	Be not therefore solicitous for to morrow; for the morrow will be solicitous for itself. Suffi- cient for the day is the evil thereof.
<br>
<br>Chapter 7
<br>Judge not, that you may not be judged,
<br>2	For with what judgment you judge, you shall be judged: and with what measure you mete, it shall be measured to you again.
<br>3	Any why seest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye; and seest not the beam that is in thy own eye?
<br>4	Or how sayest thou to thy brother: Let me cast the mote out of thy eye; and behold a beam is in thy own eye?
<br>5	Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam in thy own eye, and then shalt thou see to cast out the mote out of thy brother’s eye.
<br>6	Give not that which is holy to dogs; neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest perhaps they trample them under their feet, and turning upon you, they tear you.
<br>7	Ask, and it shall be given you: seek, and you shall find: knock, and it shall be opened to you. 8 For every one that asketh, receiveth: and he that seeketh, findeth: and to him that knocketh,
<br>it shall be opened.
<br>9	Or what man is there among you, of whom if his son shall ask bread, will he reach him a stone?
<br>10	Or if he shall ask him a fish, will he reach him a serpent?
<br>11	If you then being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children: how much more will your Father who is in heaven, give good things to them that ask him?
<br>12	All things therefore whatsoever you would that men should do to you, do you also to them.
<br> 
<br>For this is the law and the prophets.
<br>13	Enter ye in at the narrow gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction, and many there are who go in thereat.
<br>14	How narrow is the gate, and strait is the way that leadeth to life: and few there are that find it!
<br>15	Beware of false prophets, who come to you in the clothing of sheep, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
<br>16	By their fruits you shall know them. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?
<br>17	Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit, and the evil tree bringeth forth evil fruit.
<br>18	A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can an evil tree bring forth good fruit.
<br>19	Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, shall be cut down, and shall be cast into the fire.
<br>20	Wherefore by their fruits you shall know them.
<br>21	Not every one that saith to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven: but he that doth the will of my Father who is in heaven, he shall enter into the kingdom of heaven.
<br>22	Many will say to me in that day: Lord, Lord, have not we prophesied in thy name, and cast out devils in thy name, and done many mir- acles in thy name?
<br>23	And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, you that work iniq- uity.
<br>24	Every one therefore that heareth these my words, and doth them, shall be likened to a wise man that built his house upon a rock,
<br>25	And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and they beat upon that house, and it fell not, for it was founded on a rock.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>26	And every one that heareth these my words, and doth them not, shall be like a foolish man that built his house upon the sand,
<br>27	And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and they beat upon that house, and it fell, and great was the fall thereof.
<br>28	And it came to pass when Jesus had fully ended these words, the people were in admiration at his doctrine.
<br>29	For he was teaching them as one having power, and not as the scribes and Pharisees.
<br>
<br>Chapter 8
<br>And when he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him:
<br>2	And behold a leper came and adored him, saying: Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
<br>3	And Jesus stretching forth his hand, touched him, saying: I will, be thou made clean. And forthwith his leprosy was cleansed.
<br>4	And Jesus saith to him: See thou tell no man: but go, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift which Moses commanded for a testimony unto them.
<br>5	And when he had entered into Capharnaum, there came to him a centurion, beseeching him, 6 And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home
<br>sick of the palsy, and is grieviously tormented.
<br>7	And Jesus saith to him: I will come and heal him.
<br>8	And the centurion making answer, said: Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldst en- ter under my roof: but only say the word, and my servant shall be healed.
<br>9	For I also am a man subject to author- ity, having under me soldiers; and I say to this, Go, and he goeth, and to another, Come, and
<br> 
<br>he cometh, and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.
<br>10	And Jesus hearing this, marvelled; and said to them that followed him: Amen I say to you, I have not found so great faith in Israel.
<br>11	And I say to you that many shall come from the east and the west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven:
<br>12	But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into the exterior darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
<br>13	And Jesus said to the centurion: Go, and as thou hast believed, so be it done to thee. And the servant was healed at the same hour.
<br>14	And when Jesus was come into Peter’s house, he saw his wife’s mother lying, and sick of a fever:
<br>15	And he touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she arose and ministered to them.
<br>16	And when evening was come, they brought to him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word: and all that were sick he healed:
<br>17	That it might be fulfilled, which was spo- ken by the prophet Isaias, saying: He took our infirmities, and bore our diseases.
<br>18	And Jesus seeing great multitudes about him, gave orders to pass over the water.
<br>19	And a certain scribe came and said to him: Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou shalt go.
<br>20	And Jesus saith to him: The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air nests: but the son of man hath not where to lay his head.
<br>21	And another of his disciples said to him: Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.
<br>22	But Jesus said to him: Follow me, and let the dead bury their dead.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>23	And when he entered into the boat, his disciples followed him:
<br>24	And behold a great tempest arose in the sea, so that the boat was covered with waves, but he was asleep.
<br>25	And they came to him, and awaked him, saying: Lord, save us, we perish.
<br>26	And Jesus saith to them: Why are you fearful, O ye of little faith? Then rising up he commanded the winds, and the sea, and there came a great calm.
<br>27	But the men wondered, saying: What man- ner of man is this, for the winds and the sea obey him?
<br>28	And when he was come on the other side of the water, into the country of the Gerasens, there met him two that were possessed with devils, coming out of the sepulchres, exceeding fierce, so that none could pass by that way.
<br>29	And behold they cried out, saying: What have we to do with thee, Jesus Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time?
<br>30	And there was, not far from them, an herd of many swine feeding.
<br>31	And the devils besought him, saying: If thou cast us out hence, send us into the herd of swine.
<br>32	And he said to them: Go. But they going out went into the swine, and behold the whole herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea: and they perished in the waters.
<br>33	And they that kept them fled: and coming into the city, told every thing, and concerning them that had been possessed by the devils.
<br>34	And behold the whole city went out to meet Jesus, and when they saw him, they besought him that he would depart from their coasts.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 9
<br>And entering into a boat, he passed over the wa- ter and came into his own city.
<br>2	And behold they brought to him one sick of the palsy lying in a bed. And Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the man sick of the palsy: Be of good heart, son, thy sins are forgiven thee.
<br>3	And behold some of the scribes said within themselves: He blasphemeth.
<br>4	And Jesus seeing their thoughts, said: Why do you think evil in your hearts?
<br>5	Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins are for- given thee: or to say, Arise, and walk?
<br>6	But that you may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (then said he to the man sick of palsy,) Arise, take up thy bed, and go into thy house.
<br>7	And he arose, and went into his house.
<br>8	And the multitude seeing it, feared, and glo- rified God that gave such power to men.
<br>9	And when Jesus passed on from hence, he saw a man sitting in the custom house, named Matthew; and he saith to him: Follow me. And he rose up and followed him.
<br>10	And it came to pass as he was sitting at meat in the house, behold many publicans and sinners came, and sat down with Jesus and his disciples.
<br>11	And the Pharisees seeing it, said to his dis- ciples: Why doth your master eat with publicans and sinners?
<br>12	But Jesus hearing it, said: They that are in health need not a physician, but they that are ill.
<br>13	Go then and learn what this meaneth, I will have mercy and not sacrifice. For I am not come to call the just, but sinners.
<br>14	Then came to him the disciples of John, saying: Why do we and the Pharisees fast often,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>but thy disciples do not fast?
<br>15	And Jesus said to them: Can the children of the bridegroom mourn, as long as the bride- groom is with them? But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then they shall fast.
<br>16	And nobody putteth a piece of raw cloth unto an old garment. For it taketh away the fullness thereof from the garment, and there is made a greater rent.
<br>17	Neither do they put new wine into old bot- tles. Otherwise the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish. But new wine they put into new bottles: and both are preserved.
<br>18	And he was speaking these things unto them, behold a certain ruler came up, and adored him, saying: Lord, my daughter is even now dead; but come, lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.
<br>19	And Jesus rising up followed him, with his disciples.
<br>20	And behold a woman who was troubled with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment.
<br>21	For she said within herself: If I shall touch only his garment, I shall be healed.
<br>22	But Jesus turning and seeing her, said: Be of good heart, daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour.
<br>23	And when Jesus was come into the house of the ruler, and saw the minstrels and the mul- titude making a rout,
<br>24	He said: Give place, for the girl is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.
<br>25	And when the multitude was put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand. And the maid arose.
<br> 
<br>26	And the fame hereof went abroad into all that country.
<br>27	And as Jesus passed from thence, there fol- lowed him two blind men crying out and saying, Have mercy on us, O Son of David.
<br>28	And when he was come to the house, the blind men came to him. And Jesus saith to them, Do you believe, that I can do this unto you? They say to him, Yea, Lord.
<br>29	Then he touched their eyes, saying, Ac- cording to your faith, be it done unto you.
<br>30	And their eyes were opened, and Jesus strictly charged them, saying, See that no man know this.
<br>31	But they going out, spread his fame abroad in all that country.
<br>32	And when they were gone out, behold they brought him a dumb man, possessed with a devil. 33 And after the devil was cast out, the dumb man spoke, and the multitudes wondered, say-
<br>ing, Never was the like seen in Israel.
<br>34	But the Pharisees said, By the prince of devils he casteth out devils.
<br>35	And Jesus went about all the cities, and towns, teaching in their synagogues, and preach- ing the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease, and every infirmity.
<br>36	And seeing the multitudes, he had compas- sion on them: because they were distressed, and lying like sheep that have no shepherd.
<br>37	Then he saith to his disciples, The harvest indeed is great, but the labourers are few.
<br>38	Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he send forth labourers into his harvest.
<br>
<br>Chapter 10
<br>And having called his twelve disciples together, he gave them power over unclean spirits, to cast
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>them out, and to heal all manner of diseases, and all manner of infirmities.
<br>2	And the names of the twelve apostles are these: The first, Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother,
<br>3	James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew the publican, and James the son of Alpheus, and Thaddeus,
<br>4	Simon the Cananean, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.
<br>5	These twelve Jesus sent: commanding them, saying: Go ye not into the way of the Gentiles, and into the city of the Samaritans enter ye not. 6 But go ye rather to the lost sheep of the
<br>house of Israel.
<br>7	And going, preach, saying: The kingdom of heaven is at hand.
<br>8	Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out devils: freely have you received, freely give.
<br>9	Do not possess gold, nor silver, nor money in your purses:
<br>10	Nor scrip for your journey, nor two coats, nor shoes, nor a staff; for the workman is worthy of his meat.
<br>11	And into whatsoever city or town you shall enter, inquire who in it is worthy, and there abide till you go thence.
<br>12	And when you come into the house, salute it, saying: Peace be to this house.
<br>13	And if that house be worthy, your peace shall come upon it; but if it be not worthy, your peace shall return to you.
<br>14	And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words: going forth out of that house or city shake off the dust from your feet.
<br>15	Amen I say to you, it shall be more tolera- ble for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.
<br> 
<br>16	Behold I send you as sheep in the midst of wolves. Be ye therefore wise as serpents and simple as doves.
<br>17	But beware of men. For they will deliver you up in councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues.
<br>18	And you shall be brought before governors, and before kings for my sake, for a testimony to them and to the Gentiles:
<br>19	But when they shall deliver you up, take no thought how or what to speak: for it shall be given you in that hour what to speak.
<br>20	For it is not you that speak, but the Spirit of your Father that speaketh in you.
<br>21	The brother also shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the son: and the children shall rise up against their parents, and shall put them to death.
<br>22	And you shall be hated by all men for my name’s sake: but he that shall persevere unto the end, he shall be saved.
<br>23	And when they shall persecute you in this city, flee into another. Amen I say to you, you shall not finish all the cities of Israel, till the Son of man come.
<br>24	The disciple is not above the master, nor the servant above his lord.
<br>25	It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the goodman of the house Beelzebub, how much more them of his household?
<br>26	Therefore fear them not. For nothing is covered that shall not be revealed: nor hid, that shall not be known.
<br>27	That which I tell you in the dark, speak ye in the light: and that which you hear in the ear, preach ye upon the housetops.
<br>28	And fear ye not them that kill the body, and are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him that can destroy both soul and body in hell.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>29	Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and not one of them shall fall on the ground with- out your Father.
<br>30	But the very hairs of your head are all num- bered.
<br>31	Fear not therefore: better are you than many sparrows.
<br>32	Every one therefore that shall confess me before men, I will also confess him before my Father who is in heaven.
<br>33	But he that shall deny me before men, I will also deny him before my Father who is in heaven.
<br>34	Do not think that I came to send peace upon earth: I came not to send peace, but the sword.
<br>35	For I came to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.
<br>36	And as a man’s enemies shall be they of his own household.
<br>37	He that loveth father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me; and he that loveth son or daughter more than me, is not worthy of me. 38 And he that taketh not up his cross, and
<br>followeth me, is not worthy of me.
<br>39	He that findeth his life, shall lose it: and he that shall lose his life for me, shall find it.
<br>40	He that receiveth you, receiveth me: and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that sent me. 41 He that receiveth a prophet in the name of
<br>a prophet, shall receive the reward of a prophet: and he that receiveth a just man in the name of a just man, shall receive the reward of a just man.
<br>42 And whosoever shall give to drink to one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, amen I say to you, he shall not lose his reward.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 11
<br>And it came to pass,   when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples, he passed from thence, to teach and preach in their cities.
<br>2	Now when John had heard in prison the works of Christ: sending two of his disciples he said to him:
<br>3	Art thou he that art to come, or look we for another?
<br>4	And Jesus making answer said to them: Go and relate to John what you have heard and seen. 5 The blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead rise again, the
<br>poor have the gospel preached to them.
<br>6	And blessed is he that shall not be scandal- ized in me.
<br>7	And when they went their way, Jesus be- gan to say to the multitudes concerning John: What went you out into the desert to see? a reed shaken with the wind?
<br>8	But what went you out to see? a man clothed in soft garments? Behold they that are clothed in soft garments, are in the houses of kings.
<br>9	But what went you out to see? a prophet? yea I tell you, and more than a prophet.
<br>10	For this is he of whom it is written: Be- hold I send my angel before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.
<br>11	Amen I say to you, there hath not risen among them that are born of women a greater than John the Baptist: yet he that is the lesser in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
<br>12	And from the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent bear it away.
<br>13	For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>14	And if you will receive it, he is Elias that is to come.
<br>15	He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
<br>16	But whereunto shall I esteem this genera- tion to be like? It is like to children sitting in the market place.
<br>17	Who crying to their companions say: We have piped to you, and you have not danced: we have lamented, and you have not mourned.
<br>18	For John came neither eating nor drinking; and they say: He hath a devil.
<br>19	The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say: Behold a man that is a glutton and a wine drinker, a friend of publicans and sinners. And wisdom is justified by her children.
