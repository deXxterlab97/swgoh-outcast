<br>Section, act Mar. 3, 1925, ch. 462, 43 Stat. 1144, which abolished office of surveyor general and transferred its functions to Field Surveying Service under Supervisor of Surveys, was superseded by Reorg. Plan No. 3 of 1946, §403, eff. July 16, 1946, 11 F.R. 7876, 60 Stat. 1100. See note set out under section 1 of this title.
<br>
<br>The office of surveyor general abolished in certain States by acts July 31, 1876, ch. 246, 19 Stat. 121, and Oct. 2, 1888, ch. 1069, 25 Stat. 525, and discontinued in others pursuant to R.S. §2218.
<br>
<br>So far as they were not already superseded or obsolete by reason of abolition or discontinuance of the office, or otherwise, the following provisions were superseded by former provisions of this section:
<br>
<br>R.S. §2207, providing for appointment of surveyors general in States and territories therein named, and acts Apr. 10, 1890, ch. 77, §1, 26 Stat. 53, and July 24, 1897, ch. 14, §2, 30 Stat. 215, providing for surveyors general in North and South Dakota and Alaska;
<br>
<br>R.S. §§2208 to 2211; acts Apr. 10, 1890, ch. 77, §2, 26 Stat. 53; July 24, 1897, ch. 14, §3, 30 Stat. 215, concerning salaries of particular surveyors general;

<br>Act Mar. 3, 1893, ch. 211, 27 Stat. 709, relative to consolidation of offices of two or more surveyors general; and provisions of act May 24, 1922, ch. 199, 42 Stat. 556, and prior acts concerning detail of clerks from office of one surveyor general to another.
<br>§52. Surveying duties
<br>
<br>The Secretary of the Interior or such officer as he may designate shall engage a sufficient number of skillful surveyors as his deputies, to whom he is authorized to administer the necessary oaths upon their appointments. He shall have authority to frame regulations for their direction, not inconsistent with law or the instructions of the Bureau of Land Management, and to remove them for negligence or misconduct in office.
<br>
<br>Second. He shall cause to be surveyed, measured, and marked, without delay, all base and meridian lines through such points and perpetuated by such monuments, and such other correction parallels and meridians as may be prescribed by law or by instructions from the Bureau of Land Management, in respect to the public lands to which the Indian title has been or may be extinguished.
<br>
<br>Third. He shall cause to be surveyed all private land claims after they have been confirmed by authority of Congress, so far as may be necessary to complete the survey of the public lands.
<br>
<br>Fourth. He shall transmit to the officer, as the Secretary of the Interior may designate, of the respective land offices general and particular plats of all lands surveyed by him for each land district; and he shall forward copies of such plats to such officer as the Secretary may designate.
<br>
<br>Fifth. He shall, so far as is compatible with the desk duties of his office, occasionally inspect the surveying operations while in progress in the field, sufficiently to satisfy himself of the fidelity of the execution of the work according to contract, and the actual and necessary expenses incurred by him while so engaged shall be allowed; and where it is incompatible with his other duties for the Secretary of the Interior or such officer as he may designate to devote the time necessary to make a personal inspection of the work in progress, then he is authorized to depute a confidential agent to make such examination; and the actual and necessary expenses of such person shall be allowed and paid for that service, and $5 a day during the examination in the field; but such examination shall not be protracted beyond thirty days; and in no case longer than is actually necessary; and when the Secretary or such officer, or any person employed in his office at a regular salary, is engaged in such special service, he shall receive only his necessary expenses in addition to his regular salary.
<br>
<br>(R.S. §2223; Mar. 3, 1925, ch. 462, 43 Stat. 1144; 1946 Reorg. Plan No. 3, §403, eff. July 16, 1946, 11 F.R. 7876, 60 Stat. 1100.)

<br>
<br>References to Supervisor of Surveys and Commissioner of General Land Office changed to Secretary of the Interior or such officer as he may designate, reference to manager changed to officer designated by Secretary of the Interior, and "Bureau of Land Management" substituted for "General Land Office" on authority of section 403 of Reorg. Plan No. 3 of 1946. See note set out under section 1 of this title.

<br>§53. Powers devolved on Secretary of the Interior on turning over of papers to States
<br>
<br>In all cases where, as provided in section 54 of this title, the field notes, maps, records, and other papers appertaining to land titles in any State are turned over to the authorities of such State, the same authority, powers, and duties in relation to the survey, resurvey, or subdivision of the lands therein, and all matters and things connected therewith, as previously exercised by the surveyor general, whose district included such State, shall be vested in, and devolved upon, the Secretary of the Interior or such officer as he may designate.

<br>The original text of R.S. §2218 provided for completion of surveys "in the several surveying-districts for which surveyors general have been, or may be, appointed" and also provided that "the surveyor general thereof shall be required to deliver over" all papers appertaining to land titles within the district, "and the office of surveyor general in every such district shall thereafter cease and be discontinued." The references to the surveyors general were omitted in view of act Mar. 3, 1925 (classified to section 51 of this title) abolishing office of surveyor general and transferring its activities to the Field Surveying Service, under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Supervisor of Surveys. See, also, Transfer of Functions note below.
