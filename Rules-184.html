<br>(2) the head of the agency concerned authorizes storage of the household goods and personal effects in the public interest or for reasons of economy.

<br>
<br>The amendment of subsection (a) of 5 U.S.C. 5726 reflects the addition of a new subsection (c).
<br>
<br>Subsection (b) of 5 U.S.C. 5726 was derived from subsection (e) of section 1 of the Administrative Expenses Act of 1946, as amended (74 Stat. 796). In the codification of subsection (e), the words "7,000 pounds net weight" were substituted for "the maximum weight limitation provided by subsection (a)". During the pendency of the codification bill, section 1(a)(2) of Public Law 89–516, amended subsection (a) of section 1 of the Administrative Expenses Act of 1946 to increase the maximum weight limitation from 7,000 to 11,000 pounds. Thus, the amendment of subsection (b) is necessary to reflect the current weight limitation applicable.
<br>
<br>In subsection (c), the word "employee" is substituted for "civilian officer or employee" to conform to the definitions in 5 U.S.C. 5721(2) and 2105. The words "including a new appointee and a student trainee to the extent authorized by section 5723 of this title" are substituted for "including any new appointee in accordance with section 7(b) of this Act, as amended" for clarity and to reflect the codification of section 7(b) in 5 U.S.C. 5723. The words "continental United States" are coextensive with and substituted for "continental United States, excluding Alaska" on authority of the definition of "continental United States" in 5 U.S.C. 5721(3). The words "head of the agency concerned" are substituted for "head of the Executive Department or agency concerned" to conform to the definition in 5 U.S.C. 5721(1). In the penultimate sentence, the words "sections 5723(a) and 5724(a) of this title" are substituted for "section 1 or 7(b) of this Act" to reflect the codification of sections 1 and 7(b) in 5 U.S.C. 5723(a) and 5724(a); and the word "officer" is omitted as included in "employee". In the last sentence, the words "under this subsection" are inserted for clarity.
<br>
<br>Subsection (b) of section 25 of the Administrative Expenses Act of 1946 (added by section 2 of Public Law 89–516) is omitted as executed.

<br>§5727. Transportation of motor vehicles
<br>
<br>(a) Except as specifically authorized by statute, an authorization in a statute or regulation to transport the effects of an employee or other individual at Government expense is not an authorization to transport an automobile.
<br>
<br>(b) Under regulations prescribed under section 5738 of this title, the privately owned motor vehicle of an employee, including a new appointee and a student trainee to the extent authorized by sections 5722 and 5723 of this title, may be transported at Government expense to, from, and between the continental United States and a post of duty outside the continental United States, or between posts of duty outside the continental United States, when—
<br>
<br>(1) the employee is assigned to the post of duty for other than temporary duty; and
<br>
<br>(2) the head of the agency concerned determines that it is in the interest of the Government for the employee to have the use of a motor vehicle at the post of duty.
<br>
<br>(c) Under regulations prescribed under section 5738 of this title, the privately owned motor vehicle or vehicles of an employee, including a new appointee or a student trainee for whom travel and transportation expenses are authorized under section 5723 of this title, may be transported at Government expense to a new official station of the employee when the agency determines that such transport is advantageous and cost-effective to the Government.
<br>
<br>(d) An employee may transport only one motor vehicle under subsection (b) of this section during a 4-year period, except when the head of the agency concerned determines that replacement of the motor vehicle during the period is necessary for reasons beyond the control of the employee and is in the interest of the Government, and authorizes in advance the transportation under subsection (b) of this section of one additional privately owned motor vehicle as a replacement. When an employee has remained in continuous service outside the continental United States during the 4-year period after the date of transportation under subsection (b) of this section of his motor vehicle, the head of the agency concerned may authorize transportation under subsection (b) of this section of a replacement for that motor vehicle.
<br>
<br>(e) When the head of an agency authorizes transportation under subsection (b) or (c) of this section of a privately owned motor vehicle, the transportation may be by—
<br>
<br>(1) commercial means, if available at reasonable rates and under reasonable conditions; or
<br>
<br>(2) Government means on a space-available basis.
<br>
<br>(f)(1) This section, except subsection (a), does not apply to—
<br>
<br>(A) the Foreign Service of the United States; or

<br>
<br>The words "a military department" are inserted to preserve the application of the source law. Before enactment of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (63 Stat. 578), the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force were Executive departments. The National Security Act Amendments of 1949 established the Department of Defense as an Executive Department including the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force as military departments, not as Executive departments. However, the source law for this section, which was in effect in 1949, remained applicable to the Secretaries of the military departments by virtue of section 12(g) of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (63 Stat. 591), which is set out in the reviser's note for section 301.

<br>
<br>Subsection (a) is based on the words "department, independent establishment, agency, or federally owned or controlled corporation, hereinafter called department" in former section 103a. The terms "Executive agency" and "military department" include a department, independent establishment, agency, or federally owned or controlled corporation in the executive branch because of the definitions in sections 105 and 102.
<br>
<br>The words "a military department" are included to preserve the application of the source law. Before enactment of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (63 Stat. 578), the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force were Executive departments. The National Security Act Amendments of 1949 established the Department of Defense as an Executive Department including the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force, as military departments, not as Executive departments. However, the source law for this section, which was in effect in 1949, remained applicable to the Secretaries of the military departments by virtue of section 12(g) of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (63 Stat. 591), which is set out in the reviser's note for section 301.
<br>
<br>Subsection (b) is restated for clarity and conciseness and to eliminate redundancy. In paragraphs (1) and (2), the words "outside the United States" are coextensive with and substituted for "in a Territory or possession of the United States or in a foreign country".
<br>
<br>Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.

If the case involves the activity in connection with which he is employed, the travel expenses are paid from the appropriation otherwise available for travel expenses of the employee under proper certification by a certifying official of the agency concerned. If the case does not involve its activity, the employing agency may advance or pay the travel expenses of the employee, and later obtain reimbursement from the agency properly chargeable with the travel expenses.
<br>
<br>(b) An employee as defined by section 2105 of this title (except an individual whose pay is disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate or the Chief Administrative Officer of the House of Representatives) summoned, or assigned by his agency, to testify in his official capacity or produce official records, on behalf of a party other than the United States, is entitled to travel expenses under subchapter I of this chapter, except to the extent that travel expenses are paid to the employee for his appearance by the court, authority, or party which caused him to be summoned.

<br>
<br>(b) The Office of Personnel Management may authorize the head of an agency to pay a bonus under this section to an individual only if—
<br>
<br>(1) the position to which such individual is appointed (as described in paragraph (2)(A)) or to which such individual moves or must relocate (as described in paragraph (2)(B)) is likely to be difficult to fill in the absence of such a bonus; and

<br>
<br>(d)(1) Except as provided in subsection (e), a bonus under this section shall not exceed 25 percent of the annual rate of basic pay of the employee at the beginning of the service period multiplied by the number of years (including a fractional part of a year, as determined under regulations of the Office) in the required service period of the employee involved.

<br>
<br>(2) in no event exceed 100 percent of the annual rate of basic pay of the employee at the beginning of the service period.
<br>
<br>Nothing in this subsection shall be considered to permit the waiver of any requirement under subsection (c).
