<br>30	Her young ones shall suck up blood: and wheresoever the carcass shall be, she is immedi- ately there.
<br>31	And the Lord went on, and said to Job:
<br>32	Shall he that contendeth with God be so easily silenced? surely he that reproveth God, ought to answer him.
<br>33	Then Job answered the Lord, and said:
<br>34	What can I answer, who hath spoken in- considerately? I will lay my hand upon my mouth.
<br>35	One thing I have spoken, which I wish I had not said: and another, to which I will add no more.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 40
<br>And the Lord answering Job out of the whirl- wind, said:
<br>2	Gird up thy loins like a man: I will ask thee, and do thou tell me.
<br>3	Wilt thou make void my judgment: and con- demn me, that thou mayst be justified?
<br>4	And hast thou an arm like God, and canst thou thunder with a voice like him?
<br>5	Clothe thyself with beauty, and set thyself up on high, and be glorious, and put on goodly garments.
<br>6	Scatter the proud in thy indignation, and behold every arrogant man, and humble him.
<br>7	Look on all that are proud, and confound them, and crush the wicked in their place,
<br>8	Hide them in the dust together, and plunge their faces into the pit.
<br>9	Then I will confess that thy right hand is able to save thee.
<br>10	Behold behemoth whom I made with thee, he eateth grass like an ox.
<br>11	His strength is in his loins, and his force in the navel of his belly.
<br>12	He setteth up his tail like a cedar, the sinews of his testicles are wrapped together.
<br>13	His bones are like pipes of brass, his gristle like plates of iron.
<br>14	He is the beginning of the ways of God, who made him, he will apply his sword.
<br>15	To him the mountains bring forth grass: there all the beasts of the field shall play.
<br>16	He sleepeth under the shadow, in the covert of the reed, and in moist places.
<br>17	The shades cover his shadow, the willows of the brook shall compass him about.
<br>18	Behold, he will drink up a river, and not wonder: and he trusteth that the Jordan may run into his mouth.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>19	In his eyes as with a hook he shall take him, and bore through his nostrils with stakes.
<br>20	Canst thou draw out the leviathan with a hook, or canst thou tie his tongue with a cord?
<br>21	Canst thou put a ring in his nose, or bore through his jaw with a buckle?
<br>22	Will he make many supplications to thee, or speak soft words to thee?
<br>23	Will he make a covenant with thee, and wilt thou take him to be a servant for ever,
<br>24	Shalt thou play with him as with a bird, or tie him up for thy handmaids?
<br>25	Shall friends cut him in pieces, shall mer- chants divide him?
<br>26	Wilt thou fill nets with his skin, and the cabins of fishes with his head?
<br>27	Lay thy hand upon him: remember the battle, and speak no more.
<br>28	Behold his hope shall fail him, and in the sight of all he shall be cast down.
<br>
<br>Chapter 41
<br>
<br>I will not stir him up, like one that is cruel, for who can resist my countenance?
<br>2	Who hath given me before that I should re- pay him? All things that are under heaven are mine.
<br>3	I will not spare him, nor his mighty words, and framed to make supplication.
<br>4	Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can go into the midst of his mouth?
<br>5	Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about.
<br>6	His body is like molten shields, shut close up with scales pressing upon one another.
<br>7	One is joined to another, and not so much as any air can come between them:
<br> 
<br>8	They stick one to another and they hold one another fast, and shall not be separated.
<br>9	His sneezing is like the shining of fire, and his eyes like the eyelids of the morning.
<br>10	Out of his mouth go forth lamps, like torches of lighted fire.
<br>11	Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, like that of a pot heated and boiling.
<br>12	His breath kindleth coals, and a flame cometh forth out of his mouth.
<br>13	In his neck strength shall dwell, and want goeth before his face.
<br>14	The members of his flesh cleave one to an- other: he shall send lightnings against him, and they shall not be carried to another place.
<br>15	His heart shall be as hard as a stone, and as firm as a smith’s anvil,
<br>16	When he shall raise him up, the angels shall fear, and being affrighted shall purify them- selves.
<br>17	When a sword shall lay at him, it shall not be able to hold, nor a spear, nor a breastplate.
<br>18	For he shall esteem iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.
<br>19	The archer shall not put him to flight, the stones of the sling are to him like stubble.
<br>20	As stubble will he esteem the hammer, and he will laugh him to scorn who shaketh the spear. 21 The beams of the sun shall be under him,
<br>and he shall strew gold under him like mire.
<br>22	He shall make the deep sea to boil like a pot, and shall make it as when ointments boil.
<br>23	A path shall shine after him, he shall es- teem the deep as growing old.
<br>24	There is no power upon earth that can be compared with him who was made to fear no one,
<br>25	He beholdeth every high thing, he is king over all the children of pride.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 42
<br>Then Job answered the Lord, and said:
<br>2	I know that thou canst do all things, and no thought is hid from thee.
<br>3	Who is this that hideth counsel without knowledge? Therefore I have spoken unwisely, and things that above measure exceeded my knowledge.
<br>4	Hear, and I will speak: I will ask thee, and do thou tell me.
<br>5	With the hearing of the ear, I have heard thee, but now my eye seeth thee.
<br>6	Therefore I reprehend myself, and do penance in dust and ashes.
<br>7	And after the Lord had spoken these words to Job, he said to Eliphaz the Themanite: My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends, because you have not spoken the thing that is right before me, as my servant Job hath.
<br>8	Take unto you therefore seven oxen and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and of- fer for yourselves a holocaust, and my servant Job shall pray for you: his face I will accept, that folly be not imputed to you: for you have not spoken right things before me, as my servant Job hath.
<br>9	So Eliphaz the Themanite, and Baldad the Suhite, and Sophar the Naamathite went, and did as the Lord had spoken to them, and the Lord accepted the face of Job.
<br>10	The Lord also was turned at the penance of Job, when he prayed for his friends. And the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before.
<br>11	And all his brethren came to him, and all his sisters, and all that knew him before, and they ate bread with him in his house: and be- moaned him, and comforted him upon all the evil that God had brought upon him. And every
<br> 
<br>man gave him one ewe, and one earring of gold. 12 And the Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning. And he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses. 13 And he had seven sons, and three daugh-
<br>ters.
<br>14	And he called the name of one Dies, and the name of the second Cassia, and the name of the third Cornustibii.
<br>15	And there were not found in all the earth women so beautiful as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.
<br>16	And Job lived after these things, a hundred and forty years, and he saw his children, and his children’s children, unto the fourth generation, and he died an old man, and full of days.

<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>Blessed is the man who hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners, nor sat in the chair of pestilence:
<br>2	But his will is in the law of the Lord, and on his law he shall meditate day and night.
<br>3	And he shall be like a tree which is planted near the running waters, which shall bring forth its fruit, in due season. And his leaf shall not fall off: and all whatsoever he shall do shall prosper.
<br>4	Not so the wicked, not so: but like the dust, which the wind driveth from the face of the earth.
<br>5	Therefore the wicked shall not rise again in judgment: nor sinners in the council of the just. 6 For the Lord knoweth the way of the just:
<br>and the way of the wicked shall perish.
<br>
<br>Chapter 2
<br>Why have the Gentiles raged, and the prople de- vised vain things?
<br>2	The kings of the earth stood up, and the princes met together, against the Lord, and against his Christ.
<br>3	Let us break their bonds asunder: and let us cast away their yoke from us.
<br>4	He that dwelleth in heaven shall laugh at them: and the Lord shall deride them.
<br>5	Then shall he speak to them in his anger, and trouble them in his rage.
<br> 
<br>
<br>6	But I am appointed king by him over Sion, his holy mountain, preahing his comandment.
<br>7	The Lord hath said to me: Thou art my son, this day have I begotten thee.
<br>8	Ask of me, and I will give thee the Gentiles for thy inheritance, and the utmost parts of the earth for thy possession.
<br>9	Thou shalt rule them with a rod of iron, and shalt break them in pieces like a potter’s vessel. 10 And now, O ye kings, understand: receive
<br>instruction, you that judge the earth.
<br>11	Serve ye the Lord with fear: and rejoice unto him with trembling.
<br>12	Embrace discipline, lest at any time the Lord be angry, and you perish from the just way. 13 When his wrath shall be kindled in a short
<br>time, blessed are all they that trust in him.
<br>
<br>Chapter 3
<br>The psalm of David when he fled from the face of his son Absalom.
<br>2 Many say to my soul: There is no salavation for him in his God.
<br>4	But thou, O Lord, art my protector, my glory, and the lifter up of my head.
<br>5	I have cried to the Lord with my voice: and he hath heard me from his holy hill.
<br>6	I have slept and have taken my rest: and I have risen up, because the Lord hath protected me.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>7	I will not fear thousands of the people sur- rounding me: arise, O Lord; save me, O my God.
<br>8	For thou hast struck all them who are my adversaries without cause: thou hast broken the teeth of sinners.
<br>9	Salvation is of the Lord: and thy blessing is upon thy people.
<br>
<br>
<br>Chapter 4
<br>
<br>Unto the end, in verses. A psalm for David.
<br>2	When I called upon him, the God of my justice heard me: when I was in distress, thou hast enlarged me. Have mercy on me: and hear my prayer.
<br>3	O ye sons of men, how long will you be dull of heart? why do you love vanity, and seek after lying?
<br>4	Know ye also that the Lord hath made his holy one wonderful: the Lord will hear me when I shall cry unto him.
<br>5	Be ye angry, and sin not: the things you say in your hearts, be sorry for them upon your beds.
<br>6	Offer up the sacrifice of justice, and trust in the Lord: many say, Who sheweth us good things?
<br>7	The light of thy countenance, O Lord, is signed upon us: thou hast given gladness in my heart.
<br>8	By the fruit of their corn, their wine, and oil, they rest:
<br>9	In peace in the self same I will sleep, and I will rest:
<br>10	For thou, O Lord, singularly hast settled me in hope.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 5
<br>
<br>Unto the end, for her that obtaineth the inheri- tance. A psalm for David.
<br>2	Give ear, O Lord, to my words, understand my cry.
<br>3	Hearken to the voice of my prayer, O my King and my God.
<br>4	For to thee will I pray: O Lord, in the morn- ing thou shalt hear my voice.
<br>5	In the morning I will stand before thee, and I will see: because thou art not a God that willest iniquity.
<br>6	Neither shall the wicked dwell near thee: nor shall the unjust abide before thy eyes.
<br>7	Thou hatest all the workers of iniquity: thou wilt destroy all that speak a lie. The bloody and the deceitful man the Lord will abhor.
<br>8	But as for me in the multitude of thy mercy, I will come into thy house; I will worship towards thy holy temple, in thy fear.
<br>9	Conduct me, O Lord, in thy justice: because of my enemies, direct my way in thy sight.
<br>10	For there is no truth in their mouth: their heart is vain.
<br>11	Their throat is an open sepulchre: they dealt deceitfully with their tongues: judge them, O God. Let them fall from their devices: ac- cording to the multitude of their wickednesses cast them out: for they have provoked thee, O Lord.
<br>12	But let all them be glad that hope in thee: they shall rejoice for ever, and thou shalt dwell in them. And all they that love thy name shall glory in thee.
<br>13	For thou wilt bless the just. O Lord, thou hast crowned us, as with a shield of thy good will.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 6
<br>Unto the end, in verses, a psalm for David, for the octave.
<br>2	O Lord, rebuke me not in thy indignation, nor chastise me in thy wrath.
<br>3	Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am weak: heal me, O Lord, for my bones are troubled.
<br>4	And my soul is troubled exceedingly: but thou, O Lord, how long?
<br>5	Turn ot me, O Lord, and deliver my soul: O save me for thy mercy’s sake.
<br>5 For there is no one indeath, that is mindful of thee: and who shall confess to thee in hell?
<br>7	I have laboured in my groanings, every night I will wash my bed: I will water my couch with my tears.
<br>8	My eye is troubled through indignation: I have grown old amongst all my enemies.
<br>9	Depart from em, all ye workers of iniquity: for the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping. 10 The Lord hath heard my supplication: the
<br>Lord hath received my prayer.
<br>11 Let all my enemies be ashamed, and be very much troubled: let them be turned back, and be ashamed very speedily.
<br>
<br>Chapter 7
<br>The psalm of David, which he sung to the Lord, for the words of Chusi, the son of Jemini.
<br>2	O Lord, my God, in thee have I put my trust; same me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me.
<br>3	Lest at any time he seize upon my soul like a lion, while there is no one to redeem me, nor to save.
<br>4	O Lord, my God, if I have done this thing, if there be iniquity in my hands:
<br> 
<br>5	If I have rendered to them that repaid me evils, let me deservedly fall empty before my en- emies.
<br>6	Let the enemy pursue my soul, and take it, and tread down my life, on the earth, and bring down my glory to the dust.
<br>7	Rise up, O Lord, in thy anger: and be thou exalted in the borders of my enemies. And arise, O Lord, my God, in the precept which thou hast commanded:
<br>8	And a congregation of people shall surround thee. And for their sakes return thou on high.
<br>9	The Lord judgeth the people. Judge me, O Lord, according to my justice, and according to my innocence in me.
<br>10	The wickedness of sinners shall be brought to nought; and thou shalt direct the just: the searcher of hearts and reins is God. Just
<br>11	Is my help from the Lord; who saveth the upright of heart.
<br>12	God is a just judge, strong and patient: is he angry every day?
<br>13	Except you will be converted, he will bran- dish his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.
<br>14	And in it he hath prepared to instruments of death, he hath made ready his arrows for them that burn.
<br>15	Behold he hath been in labour iwht in- justice: he hath conceived sorrow, and brought forth iniquity.
<br>16	He hath opened a pit and dug it: and he is fallen into the hole he made.
<br>17	His sorrow shall be turned on his own head: and his iniquity shall come down upon his crown. 18 I will give glory to the Lord according to
<br>his justice: and will sing to the name of the Lord
<br>the most high.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 8
<br>
<br>Unto the end, for the presses: a psalm for David.
<br>2	O Lord, our Lord, how admirable is thy name in the whole earth! For thy magnificence is elevated above the heavens.
<br>3	Out of the mouth of infants and of sucklings thou hast perfected praise, because of thy en- emies, that thou mayst destroy the enemy and the avenger.
<br>4	For I will behold thy heavens, the works of thy fingers: the moon and the stars which thou hast founded.
<br>5	What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him?
<br>6	Thou hast made him a little less than the angels, thou hast crowned him with glory and honour:
<br>7	And hast set him over the works of thy hands.
<br>8	Thou hast subjected all things under his feet, all sheep and oxen: moreover, the beasts also of the fields.
<br>9	The birds of the air, and the fishes of the sea, that pass through the paths of the sea.
<br>10	O Lord, our Lord, how admirable is thy name in the whole earth!
<br>
<br>Chapter 9
<br>
<br>Unto the end, for the hidden things of the Son. A psalm for David.
<br>2	I will give lpraise to thee, O Lord, with my whole heart: I will relate all thy wonders.
<br>3	I will be glad, and rejoice inthee: I will sing to thy name, O thou most high.
<br>4	When my enemy shall be turned back: they shall be weakened, and perish before thy face.
<br> 
<br>5	For thou hast maintained my judgment and my cause: thou hast sat on the throne, who judgest justice.
<br>6	Thou hast rebuked the Gentiles, and thw wicked one hath perished; thou hast blotted out their name for ever and ever.
<br>7	The swords of the enemy have failed unto the end: and their cities thou hast destroyed. Their memory hath perished with a noise:
<br>8	But the Lord remaineth for ever. He hath prepared his throne in judgment:
<br>9	And he shall judge the world in equity, he shall judge the lpeople in justice.
<br>10	And the Lord is become a refuge for the poor: a helper in due time in tribulation.
<br>11	And let them trust in thee who know thy name: for thou hast not forsaken them that seek thee, O Lord.
<br>12	Sing ye to the Lord, who dwelleth in Sion: declare his ways among the Gentiles:
<br>13	For requiring their blood, he hath remem- bered them: he hath not forgotten the cry of the poor.
<br>14	Have mercy on me, O Lord: see my humil- iation which I suffer from my enemies.
<br>15	Thou that liftest me up from the gates of death, that I may declare all thy praises in the gates of the daughter of Sion.
<br>16	I will rejoice in thy salvation: the Gentiles have stuck fast in the destruction which they pre- pared. Their foot hath been taken in the very snare which they hid.
<br>17	The Lord shall be known when he exe- cuteth judgments: the sinner hath been caught in the works of his own hands.
<br>18	The wicked shall be turned into hell, all the nations that forget God.
<br>19	For the poor man shall not be forgotten to the end: the patience of the poor shall not perish for ever.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>20	Arise, O Lord, let not man be strength- ened: let the Gentiles be judged in thy sight.
<br>21	Appoint, O Lord, a lawgiver over them: that the Gentiles may know themselves to be but men.
<br>Why, O Lord, hast thou retired afar off? why dost thou slight us in our wants, in the time of trouble?
<br>2	Whilst the wicked man is proud, the poor is set on fire: they are caught in the counsels which they devise.
<br>3	For the sinner is praised in the desires of his soul: and the unjust man is blessed.
<br>4	The sinner hath provoked the Lord, accord- ing to the multitude of his wrath, he will not seek him:
<br>5	God is not before his eyes: his ways are filthy at all times. Thy judgments are removed form his sight: he shall rule over all his enemies.
<br>6	For he hath said in his heart: I shall not be moved from generation to generation, and shall be without evil.
<br>7	His mouth is full of cursing, and of bitter- ness, and of deciet: under his tongue are labour and sorrow.
<br>8	He sitteth in ambush with the rich, in private places, that he may kill the innocent.
<br>9	His eyes are upon the poor man: he lieth in wait, in secret, like a lion in his den. He lieth in ambush, that he may catch the poor man: so catch the poor, whilst he draweth him to him.
<br>10	In his net he will bring him down, he will crouch and fall, when he shall have power over the poor.
<br>11	For he hath said in his heart: God hath forgotten, he hath turned away his face, not to see to the end.
<br>12	Arise, O Lord God, let thy hand be exalted: forget not the poor.
<br> 
<br>13	Wherefore hath the wicked provoked God? for he hath said in his heart: He will not require it.
<br>14	Thou seest it, for thou considerest labour and sorrow: that thou mayst deliver them into thy hands. To thee is the poor man left: thou wilt be a helper to the orphan.
<br>15	Break thou the arm of the sinner and of the malignant: his sin shall be sought, and shall not be found.
<br>16	The Lord shall reign to eternity, yea, for ever and ever: ye Gentiles shall perish from his land.
<br>17	The Lord hath heard the desire of the poor: thy ear hath heard the preparatgion of their heart.
<br>18	To judge for the fatherless and for the hum- ble, that man may no more presume to magnify himself upon earth.
<br>
<br>Chapter 10
<br>Unto the end. A psalm to David.
<br>2	In the Lord I put my trust: how then do you say to my soul: Get thee away from hence to the mountain, like a sparrow.
<br>3	For, lo, the wicked have bent their bow: they have prepared their arows in the quiver, to shoot in the dark the upright of heart.
<br>4	For they have destroyed the things which thou hast made: but what has the just man done?
<br>5	The Lord is in his holy temple, the Lord’s throne is in heaven. His eyes look on the poor man: his eyelids examine the sons of men.
<br>6	The Lord trieth the just and the wicked: but he that loveth iniquity, hateth his own soul.
<br>7	He shall rain snares upon sinners: fire and brimstone, and storms of winds, shall be the por-
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>tion of their cup.
<br>8	For the Lord is just, and hath loved justice: his countenance hath beheld righteousness.
<br>
<br>Chapter 11
<br>Unto the end: for the octave, a psalm for David. 2 Save me, O Lord, for there is now no saint: truths are decayed from among the children of
<br>men.
<br>3 They have spoken vain things, every one to his neighbour: with deceitful lips, and with a double heart have they spoken.
<br>4 May the Lord destroy all deceitful lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things.
<br>5	Who have said: We will magnify our tongue: our lips are our own: who is Lord over us?
<br>6	By reason of the misery of the needy, and the groans of the poor, now will I arise, saith the Lord. I will set him in safety: I will deal confidently in his regard.
<br>7	The words of the Lord are pure words: as silver tried by the fire, purged from the earth, refined seven times.
<br>8	Thou, O Lord, wilt preserve us: and keep us from this generation for ever.
<br>9	The wicked walk round about: according to thy highness, thou hast multiplied the children of men.
<br>
<br>Chapter 12
<br>Unto the end, a psalm for David. How long, O Lord, wilt thou forget me unto the end? how long dost thou turn away thy face from me?
<br>2	How long shall I take counsels in my soul, sorrow in my heart all the day?
<br>3	How long shall my enemy be exalted over Me?
<br> 
<br>4	Consider, and hear me, O Lord, my God. Enlighten my eyes, that I never sleep in death:
<br>5	Lest at any time my enemy say: I have pre- vailed against him. They that trouble me, will rejoice when I am moved:
<br>6	But I have trusted in thy mercy. My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation: I will sing to the Lord, who giveth me good things: yea, I will sing to the name of the Lord, the most high.
<br>
<br>Chapter 13
<br>Unto the end, a psalm for David. The fool hath said in his heart: There is no God. They are cor- rupt, and are become abominable in their ways: there is none that doth good, no not one.
<br>2	The Lord hath looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there be any that understand and seek God.
<br>3	They are all gone aside, they are become un- profitable together: there is none that doth good: no not one. Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they acted deceitfully: the poison of asps is under their lips. Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness; their feet are swift to shed blood. Destruction and unhappi- ness in their ways; and the way of peace they have not known: there is no fear of God before their eyes.
<br>4	Shall not all they know that work iniquity, who devour my people as they eat bread?
<br>5	They have not called upon the Lord: there have they trembled for fear, where there was no fear.
<br>6	For the Lord is in the just generation: you have confounded the counsel of the poor man; but the Lord is his hope.
<br>7	Who shall give out of Sion the salvation of Israel? when the Lord shall have turned away
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
<br>
<br>Chapter 14
<br>A psalm for David. Lord, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle? or who shall rest in thy holy hill?
<br>2	He that walketh without blemish, and wor- keth justice:
<br>3	He that speaketh truth in his heart, who hath not used deceit in his tongue: Nor hath done evil to his neighbour: nor taken up a re- proach against his neighbours.
<br>4	In his sight the malignant is brought to noth- ing: but he glorifieth them that fear the Lord. He that sweareth to his neighbour, and deceiveth not;
<br>5	He that hath not put out his money to usury, nortaken bribes against the innocent: He that doth these things, chall not be moved for ever.
<br>
<br>Chapter 15
<br>The inscription of a title to David himself. Pre- serve me, O Lord, for I have put my trust in thee.
<br>2	I have said to the Lord, thou art my God, for thou hast no need of my goods.
<br>3	To the saints, who are in his land, he hath made wonderful all my desires in them.
<br>4	Their infirmities were multiplied: afterwards they made haste. I will not gather together their meetings for bloodofferings: nor will I be mindful of their names by my lips.
<br>5	The Lord is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup: it is thou that wilt restore my inheritance to me.
<br>6	The lines are fallen unto me in goodly places: for my inheritance is goodly to me.
<br> 
<br>7	I will bless the Lord, who hath given me un- derstanding: moreover, my reins also have cor- rected me even till night.
<br>8	I set the Lord always in my sight: for he is at my right hand, that I be not moved.
<br>9	Therefore my heart hath been glad, and my tongue hath rejoiced: moreover, my flesh also shall rest in hope.
<br>10	Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; nor wilt thou give thy holy one to see corruption. 11 Thou hast made known to me the ways of life, thou shalt fill me with joy with thy counte- nance: at thy right hand are delights even to the
<br>end.
<br>
<br>Chapter 16
<br>The prayer of David. Hear, O Lord, my justice: attend to my supplication. Give ear unto my prayer, which proceedeth not from deceitful lips. 2 Let my judgment come forth from thy coun- tenance: let thy eyes behold the things that are
<br>equitable.
<br>3	Thou hast proved my heart, and visited it by night, thou hast tried me by fire: and iniquity hath not been found in me.
<br>4	That my mouth may not speak the works of men: for the sake of the words of thy lips, I have kept hard ways.
<br>5	Perfect thou my goings in thy paths: that my footsteps be not moved.
<br>6	I have cried to thee, for thou, O God, hast heard me: O incline thy ear unto me, and hear my words.
<br>7	Shew forth thy wonderful mercies; thou who savest them that trust in thee.
<br>8	From them that resist thy right hand keep me, as the apple of thy eye. Protect me under the shadow of thy wings.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>9	From the face of the wicked who have af- flicted me. My enemies have surrounded my soul:
<br>10	They have shut up their fat: their mouth hath spoken proudly.
<br>11	They have cast me forth, and now they have surrounded me: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth.
<br>12	They have taken me, as a lion prepared for the prey; and as a young lion dwelling in secret places.
<br>13	Arise, O Lord, disappoint him and sup- plant him; deliver my soul from the wicked one; thy sword
<br>14	From the enemies of thy hand. O Lord, divide them from the few of the earth in their life: their belly is filled from thy hidden stores. They are full of children: and they have left to their little ones the rest of their substance.
<br>15	But as for me, I will appear before thy sight in justice: I shall be satisfied when thy glory shall appear.
<br>
<br>Chapter 17
<br>Unto the end, for David, the servant of the Lord, who spoke to the Lord the words of this canticle, in the day that the Lord delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul: and he said:
<br>2	I will love thee, O Lord, my strength:
<br>3	The Lord is my firmament, my refuge, and my deliverer. My God is my helper, and in him will I put my trust. My protector, and the horn of my salvation, and my support.
<br>4	Praising, I will call upon the Lord: and I shall be saved from my enemies.
<br>5	The sorrows of death surrounded me: and the torrents of iniquity troubled me.
<br> 
<br>6	The sorrows of hell encompassed me: and the snares of death prevented me.
<br>7	In my affliction I called upon the Lord, and I cried to my God: And he heard my voice from his holy temple: and my cry before him came into his ears.
<br>8	The earth shook and trembled: the founda- tions of the mountains were troubled and were moved, because he was angry with them.
<br>9	There went up a smoke in his wrath: and a fire flamed from his face: coals were kindled by it.
<br>10	He bowed the heavens, and came down, and darkness was under his feet.
<br>11	And he ascended upon the cherubim, and he flew; he flew upon the wings of the winds.
<br>12	And he made darkness his covert, his pavil- ion round about him: dark waters in the clouds of the air.
<br>13	At the brightness that was before him the clouds passed, hail and coals of fire.
<br>14	And the Lord thundered from heaven, and the Highest gave his voice: hail and coals of fire. 15 And he sent forth his arrows, and he scat- tered them: he multiplied lightnings, and trou-
<br>bled them.
<br>16	Then the fountains of waters appeared, and the foundations of the world were discovered: At thy rebuke, O Lord, at the blast of the spirit of thy wrath.
<br>17	He sent from on high, and took me: and received me out of many waters.
<br>18	He delivered me from my strongest ene- mies, and from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me.
<br>19	They prevented me in the day of my afflic- tion: and the Lord became my rotector.
<br>20	And he brought me forth into a large place: he saved me, because he was well pleased with me.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>21	And the Lord will reward me according to my justice; and will repay me according to the cleanness of my hands:
<br>22	Because I have kept the ways of the Lord; and have not done wickedly against my God.
<br>23	For all his judgments are in my sight: and his justices I have not put away from me.
<br>24	And I shall be spotless with him: and shall keep myself from my iniquity.
<br>25	And the Lord will reward me according to my justice: and according to the cleanness of my hands before his eyes.
<br>26	With the holy thou wilt be holy; and with the innocent man thou wilt be innocent:
<br>27	And withe the elect thou wilt be elect: and with the perverse thou wilt be perverted.
<br>28	For thou wilt save the humble people; but wilt bring down the eyes of the proud.
<br>29	For thou lightest my lamp, O Lord: O my God, enlighten my darkness.
<br>30	For by thee I shall be delivered from temp- tation; and through my God I shall go over a wall.
<br>31	As for my God, his way is undefiled: the words of the Lord are fire-tried: he is the pro- tector of all that trust in him.
<br>32	For who is God but the Lord? or who is God but our God?
<br>33	God, who hath girt me with strength; and made my way blameless.
<br>34	Who hath made my feet like the feet of harts: and who setteth me upon high places.
<br>35	Who teacheth my hands to war: and thou hast made my arms like a brazen bow.
<br>36	And thou hast given me the protection of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath held me up: And thy discipline hath corrected me unto the end: and thy discipline, the same shall teach me.
<br> 
<br>37	Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; and my feet are not weakened.
<br>38	I will pursue after my enemies, and over- take them: and I will not turn again till they are consumed.
<br>39	I will break them, and they shall not be able to stand: they shall fall under my feet.
<br>40	And thou hast girded me with strength unto battle; and hast subdued under me them that rose up against me.
<br>41	And thou hast made my enemies furn their back upon me, and hast destroyed them that hated me.
<br>42	They cried, but there was none to save them, to the Lord: but he heard them not.
<br>43	And I shall beat them as small as the dust before the wind; I shall bring them to nought, like the dirt in the streets.
<br>44	Thou wilt deliver me from the contradic- tions of the people; thou wilt make me head of the Gentiles.
<br>45	A people which I knew not, hath seerved me: at the hearing of the ear they have obeyed me.
<br>46	The children that are strangers have lied to me, strange children have faded away, and have halted from their paths.
<br>47	The Lord liveth, and blessed by my God, and let the God of my salvation be exalted.
<br>48	O God, who avengest me, and subduest the people under me, my deliverer from my enraged enemies.
<br>49	And thou wilt lift me up above them that rise up against me: from the unjust man thou wilt deliver me.
<br>50	Therefore will I give glory to thee, O Lord, among the nations, and I will sing a psalm to thy name.
<br>51	Giving great deliverance to his king, and shewing mercy to David, his anointed: and to
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>his seed for ever.
<br>
<br>Chapter 18
<br>Unto the end. APsalm Chapter for David.
<br>2	The heavens shew forth the glory of God, and the firmament declareth the work of his hands.
<br>3	Day to day uttereth speech, and night to night sheweth knowledge.
<br>4	There are no speeches nor languages, where their voices are not heard.
<br>5	Their sound hath gone forth into all the earth: and their words unto the ends of the world.
<br>6	He hath set his tabernacle in the sun: and he as a bridegroom coming out of his bridechamber, Hath rejoiced as a giant to run the way:
<br>7	His going out is from the end of heaven, And his circuit even to the end thereof: and ther is no one that can hide himself from his heat.
<br>8	The law of the Lord is unspotted, convert- ing souls: the testimony of the Lord is faithful, giving wisdom to little ones.
<br>9	The justices of the Lord are right, rejoicing hearts: the commandment of the Lord is light- some, enlightening the eyes.
<br>10	The fear of the Lord is holy, enduring for ever and ever: the judgments of the Lord are true, justified in themselves.
<br>11	More to be desired than gold and many precious stones: and sweeter than honey and the honeycomb.
<br>12	For thy servant keepeth them, and in keep- ing them there is a great reward.
<br>13	Who can understand sins? from my secret ones cleanse me, O Lord:
<br>14	And from those of others spare thy servant. If they shall  have no  dominion over  me, then
<br> 
<br>shall I be without spot: and I shall be cleansed form the greatest sin.
<br>15	And the words of my mouth shall be such as may please: and the meditation of my heart always in thy sight. O Lord, my helper and my Redeemer.
<br>
<br>Chapter 19
<br>Unto the end. A psalm for David.
<br>2 May the Lord hear thee in the day of tribula- tion: may the name of the God of Jacob protect thee.
<br>3 May he send thee help from the sanctuary: and defend thee outof Sion.
<br>4 May he be mindful of all thy sacrifices: and may thy whole burntoffering be made fat.
<br>5 May he give thee according to thy own heart; and confirm all thy counsels.
<br>6	We will rejoice in thy salvation; and in the name of our God we shall be exalted.
<br>7	The Lord fulfil all thy petitions: now have I known that the Lord hath saved his anointed. He will hear him from his holy heaven: the salvation of his right hand is in powers.
<br>8	Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will call upon the name of the Lord, our God.
<br>9	They are bound, and have fallen: but we are risen, and are set upright. O Lord, save the king: and hear us in the day that we shall call upon thee.
<br>
<br>Chapter 20
<br>Unto the end. A psalm for David.
<br>2	In thy strength, O Lord, the king shall joy; and in thy salvation he shall rejoice exceedingly.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>3	Thou hast given him his heart’s desire: and hast not withholden from him the will of his lips. 4 For thou hast prevented him with belssings of sweetness: thou hast set on his head a crown
<br>of precious stones.
<br>5	He asked life of thee: and thou hast given him length of days for ever and ever.
<br>6	His glory is great in thy salvation: glory and great beauty shalt thou lay upon hom.
<br>7	For thou shalt give him to be a blessing for ever and ever: thou shalt make him joyful in gladness with thy countenance.
<br>8	For the king hopeth in the Lord: andthrough the mercy of the most High he whall not be moved.
<br>9	Let thy hand be found by all thy enemies: let thy right hand find out all them that hate thee.
<br>10	Thou shalt make them as an oven of fire, in the time of thy anger: the Lord shall trouble them in his wrath, and fire shall devour them.
<br>11	Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth: and their seed from among the children of men.
<br>12	For they have intended evils against thee: they have devised counsels which they have not been able to establish.
<br>13	For thou shalt make them turn their back: in thy remnants thou shalt prepare their face.
<br>14	Be thou exalted, O Lord, in thy own strength: we will sing and praise thy power.
<br>
<br>Chapter 21
<br>Unto the end, for the morning protection, a psalm for David.
<br>2	O God my God, look upon me: why hast thou forsaken me?   Far from my salvation are the words of my sins.
<br> 
<br>3	O my God, I shall cry by day, and thou wilt not hear: and by night, and it shall not be reputed as folly in me.
<br>4	But thou dwellest in the holy place, the praise of Israel.
<br>5	In thee have our fathers hoped: they have hoped, and thou hast delivered them.
<br>6	They cried to thee, and they were saved: they trusted in thee, and were not confounded.
<br>7	Bukt I am a worm, and no man: the re- proach of men, and the outcast of the prople.
<br>8	All they that saw me have laughed me to scorn: they have spoken with the lips, and wagged the head.
<br>9	He hoped in the Lord, let him deliver him: let him save him, seeing he delighteth in him.
<br>10	For thou art he that hast drawn me out of the womb: my hope from the breasts of my mother.
<br>11	I was cast upon thee from the womb. From my mother’s womb thou art my God,
<br>12	Depart not from me. For tribulation is very near: for there is none to help me.
<br>13	Many calves have surrounded me: fat bulls have besieged me.
<br>14	They have opened their mouths against me, as a lion ravening and roaring.
<br>15	I am poured out like water; and all my bones are scattered. My heart is become like wax melting in the midast of my bowels.
<br>16	My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue hath cleaved to my jaws: and thou hast brought me down into the dust of death.
<br>17	For many dogs have encompassed me: the council of the malignant hath besieged me. They have dug my hands and feet.
<br>18	They have numbered all my bones. And they have looked and stared upon me.
<br>19	They lparted my garments amongst them; and upon my vesture they cast lots.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>20	But thou, O Lord, remove not thy help to a distance from me; look towards my defence.
<br>21	Deliver, O God, my soul from the sword: my only one from the hand of the dog.
<br>22	Save me from the lion’s mouth; and my lowness from the horns of the unicorns.
<br>23	I will declare thy name to my brethren: in the midst of the church will I praise thee.
<br>24	Ye that fear the Lord, praise him: all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him.
<br>25	Let all the seed of Israel fear him: because he hath not slighted nor despised the supplica- tion of the poor man. Neither hath he turned away his face form me: and when I cried to him he heard me.
<br>26	With thee is my praise in a great church: I will pay my vows in the sight of them that fear him.
<br>27	The poor shall eat and shall be filled: and they shall praise the Lord that seek him: their hearts shall live for ever and ever.
<br>28	All the ends of the earth shall remember, and shall be converted to the Lord: And all the kindreds of the Gentiles shall adore in his sight.
<br>29	For the kingdom is the Lord’s; and he shall have dominion over the nations.
<br>30	All the fat ones of the earth have eaten and have adored: all they that go down to the earth shall fall before him.
<br>31	And to him my soul shall live: and my seed shall serve him.
<br>32	There shall be declared to the Lord a gener- ation to come: and the heavens shall shew forth his justice to a people that shall be born, which the Lord hath made.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 22
<br>A psalm for David. The Lord ruleth me: and I shall want nothing.
<br>2 He hath set me in a place of pasture. He hath brought me up, on the water of refreshment: 3 He hath converted my soul. He hath led me on the paths of justice, for his own name’s sake. 4 For though I should walk in the midst of the shadow of death, I will fear no evils, for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they have
<br>comforted me.
<br>5	Thou hast prepared a table before me against them that afflict me. Thou hast anointed my head with oil; and my chalice which ine- breateth me, how goodly is it!
<br>6	And thy mercy will follow me all the days of my life. And that I may dwell in the house of the Lord unto length of days.
<br>
<br>Chapter 23
<br>On the first day of the week, a psalm for David. The earth is the Lord’s and the fulness thereof: the world, and all they that dwell therein.
<br>2	For he hath founded it upon the seas; and hath prepared it upon the rivers.
<br>3	Who shall ascend into the mountain of the Lord: or who shall stand in his holy place?
<br>4	The innocent in hands, and clean of heart, who hath not taken his soul in vain, nor sworn deceitfully to his neighbour.
<br>5	He shall receive a blessing from the Lord, and mercy from God his Saviour.
<br>6	This is the generation of them that seek him, of them that seek the face of the God of Jacob. 7 Lift up your gates, O ye princes, and be ye lifted up, O eternal gates: and the King of Glory
<br>shall enter in.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>8	Who is this King of Glory? the Lord who is strong and mighty: the Lord mighty in battle.
<br>9	Lift up your gates, O ye princes, and be ye lifted up, O eternal gates: and the King of Glory shall enter in.
<br>10	Who is this King of Glory? the Lord of hosts, he is the King of Glory.
<br>
<br>Chapter 24
<br>Unto the end, a psalm for David. To thee, O Lord, have I lifted up my soul.
<br>2	In thee, O my God, I put my trust; let me not be ashamed.
<br>3	Neither let my enemies laugh at me: for none of them that wait on thee shall be confounded.
<br>4	Let all them be confounded that act unjust things without cause.   Shew, O Lord, thy ways to me, and teach me thy paths.
<br>5	Direct me in thy truth, and teach me; for thou art God my Saviour; and on thee have I waited all the day long.
<br>6	Remember, O Lor, thy bowels of compas- sion; and thy mercies that are from the begin- ning of the world.
<br>7	The sins of my youth and my ignorances do not remember. According to thy mercy remem- ber thou me: for thy goodness’ sake, O Lord.
<br>8	The Lord is sweet and righteous: therefore he will give a law to sinners in the way.
<br>9	He will guide themild in judgment: he will teach the meek his ways.
<br>10	All the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth, to them that seek after his covenant and his testimonies.
<br>11	For thy name’s sake, O Lrod, thou wilt pardon my sin: for it is great.
<br>12	Who is the man that feareth the Lord? He hath appointed him a law in the way he hath
<br> 
<br>chosen.
<br>13	His soul shall dwell in good things: and his seed shall inherit the land.
<br>14	The Lord is a firmament to them that fear him: and his covenant shall be made manifest to them.
<br>15	My eyes are ever towards the Lord: for he shall pluck my feet out of the snare.
<br>16	Look thou upon me, and have mercy on me; for I am alone and poor.
<br>17	The troubles of my heart are multiplied: deliver me from my necessities.
<br>18	See my abjection and my labour; and for- give me all my sins.
<br>19	Consider my enemies for they are multi- plied, and have hated me with an unjust hatred. 20 Deep thou my soul, and deliver me: I shall
<br>not be ashamed, for I have hoped in thee.
<br>21	The innocent and the upright have adhered to me: because I have waited on thee.
<br>22	Deliver Israel, O God, from all his tribula- tions.
<br>
<br>Chapter 25
<br>Unto the end, a psalm for David. Judge me, O Lord, for I have walked in my innocence: and I have put my trust in the Lord, and shall not be weakened.
<br>2	Prove me, O Lord, and try me; burn my reins and my heart.
<br>3	For thy mercy is before my eyes; and I am well pleased with thy truth.
<br>4	I have not sat with the council of vanity: nei- ther will I go in with the doers of unjust things. 5 I have hated the assembly of the malignant;
<br>and with the wicked I will not sit.
<br>6 I will wash my hands among the innocent; and will compass thy altar, O Lord:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>7	That I may hear the voice of thy praise: and tell of all thy wondrous works.
<br>8	I have loved, O Lord, the beauty of thy house; and the place where thy glory dwelleth.
<br>9	Take not away my soul, O God, with the wicked: nor my life with bloody men:
<br>10	In whose hands are iniquities: their right hand is filled with gifts.
<br>11	But as for me, I have walked in my inno- cence: redeem me, and have mercy on me.
<br>12	My foot hath stood in the direct way: in the churches I will bless thee, O Lord.
<br>
<br>Chapter 26
<br>
<br>The psalm of David before he was anointed. The Lord is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear? The Lord is the protector of my life: of whom shall I be afraid?
<br>2	Whilst the wicked draw near against me, to eat my flesh. My enemies that trouble me, have themselves been weakened, and have fallen.
<br>3	If armies in camp should stand to gether against me, my heart shall not fear. If a bat- tle should rise up against me, in this will I be confident.
<br>4	One thing I have asked of the Lord, this will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life. That I may see the delight of the Lord, and may visit his temple.
<br>5	For he hath hidden me in his tabernacle; in the day of evils, he hath protected me in the secret place of his tabernacle.
<br>6	He hath exalted me upon a rock: and now he hath lifted up my head above my enemies. I have gone round, and have offered up in his tabernacle a sacrifice of jubilation: I will sing, and recite a psalm to the Lord.
<br> 
<br>7	Hear, O Lord, my voice, with which I have cried to thee: have mercy on me and hear me.
<br>8	My heart hath said to thee: My face hath sought thee: thy face, O Lord, will I still seek.
<br>9	Turn not away thy face from me; decline not in thy wrath from thy servant. Be thou my helper, forsake me not; do not thou despise me, O God my Saviour.
<br>10	For my father and my mother have left me: but the Lord hath taken me up.
<br>11	Set me, O Lord, a law in thy way, and guide me in the right path, because of my enemies.
<br>12	Deliver me not over to the will of them that trouble me; for unjust witnesses have risen up against me; and iniquity hath lied to itself.
<br>13	I believe to see the good things of the Lord in the land of the living.
<br>14	Expect the Lord, do manfully, and let thy heart take courage, and wait thou for the Lord.
<br>
<br>Chapter 27
<br>A psalm for David himself. Unto thee will I cry, O Lord: O my God, be not thou silent to me: lest if thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down into the pit.
<br>2	Hear, O Lord, the voice of my supplication, when I pray to thee; when I lift up my hands to thy holy temple.
<br>3	Draw me not away together with the wicked; and with the workers of iniquity destroy me not: Who speak peace with their neighbour, but evils are in their hearts.
<br>4	Give them according to their works, and according to the wickedness of their inventions. According to the works of their hands give thou to them: render to them their reward.
<br>5	Because they have not understood the works of the Lord, and the operations of his hands:
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>thou shalt destroy them, and shalt not build them up.
<br>6	Blessed be the Lord, for he hath heard the voice of my supplication.
<br>7	The Lord is my helper andmy protector: in him hath my heart confided, and I have been helped. And my flesh hath flourished again, and with my will I will give praise to him.
<br>8	The Lord is the strength of his people, and the protector of the salvation of his anointed.
<br>9	Save, O Lord, thy people, and bless thy in- heritance: and rule them and exalt them for ever.
<br>
<br>Chapter 28
<br>A psalm for David, at the finishing of the taber- nacle. Bring to the Lord, O ye children of God: bring to the Lord the offspring of rams.
<br>2	Bring to the Lord glory and honour: bring to the Lord glory to his name: adore ye the Lord in his holy court.
<br>3	The voice of the Lord is upon the waters; the God of majesty hath thundered, The Lord is upon many waters.
<br>4	The voice of the Lord is in power; the voice of the Lord in magnificence.
<br>5	The voice of the Lord breaketh the cedars: yea, the Lord shall break the cedars of Libanus. 6 And shall reduce them to pieces, as a calf of
<br>Libanus, and as the beloved son of unicorns.
<br>7	The voice of the Lord divideth the flame of fire:
<br>8	The voice of the Lord shaketh the desert: and the Lord shall shake the desert of Cades.
<br>9	The voice of the Lord prepareth the stags: and he will discover the thick woods: and in his temple all shall speak his glory.
<br>10	The Lord maketh the flood to dwell: and the Lord shall sit king for ever. The Lord will
<br> 
<br>give strength to his people: the Lord will bless his people with peace.
<br>
<br>Chapter 29
<br>
<br>A psalm of a canticle, at the dedication of David’s house.
<br>2	I will extol thee, O Lord, for thou hast up- held me: and hast not made my enemies to re- joice over me.
<br>3	O Lord my God, I have cried to thee, and thou hast healed me.
<br>4	Thou hast brought forth, O Lord, my soul from hell: thou hast saved me from them that go down into the pit.
<br>5	Sing to the Lord, O ye his saints: and give praise to the memory of his holiness.
<br>6	For wrath is in his indignation; and life in his good will. In the evening weeping shall have place, and in the morning gladness.
<br>7	And in my abundance I said: I shall never be moved.
<br>8	O Lord, in thy favour, thou gavest strength to my beauty. Thou turnedst away thy face from me, and I became troubled.
<br>9	To thee, O Lord, will I cry: and I will make supplication to my God.
<br>10	What profit is there in my blood, whilst I go down to corruption? Shall dust confess to thee, or declare thy truth?
<br>11	The Lord hath heard, and hath had mercy on me: the Lord became my helper.
<br>12	Thou hast turned for me my mourning into joy: thou hast cut my sackcloth, and hast com- passed me with gladness:
<br>13	To the end that my glory may sing to thee, and I may not regret: O Lord my God, I will give praise to thee for ever.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 30
<br>Unto the end, a psalm for David, in an ecstasy.
<br>2	In thee, O Lord, have I hoped, let me never be confounded: deliver me in thy justice.
<br>3	Bow down thy ear to me: make haste to deliver me. Be thou unto me a God, a protector, and a house of refuge, to save me.
<br>4	For thou art my strength and my refuge; and for thy name’s sake thou wilt lead me, and nourish me.
<br>5	Thou wilt bring me out of this snare, which they have hidden for me: for thou art my pro- tector.
<br>6	Into thy hands I commend my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O Lord, the God of truth.
<br>7	Thou hast hated them that regard vanities, to no purpose. But I have hoped in the Lord:
<br>8	I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy. For thou hast regarded my humility, thou hast saved my soul out of distresses.
<br>9	And thou hast not shut me up in the hands of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a spacious place.
<br>10	Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am af- flicted: my eye is troubled with wrath, my soul, and my belly:
<br>11	For my life is wasted with grief: and my years in sighs. My strength is weakened through poverty and my bones are disturbed.
<br>12	I am become a reproach among all my en- emies, and very much to my neighbours; and a fear to my acquaintance. They that saw me without fled from me.
<br>13	I am forgotten as one dead from the heart.
<br>I am become as a vessel that is destroyed.
<br>14	For I have heard the blame of many that dwell round about. While they assembled to- gether against me, they consulted to take away my life.
<br> 
<br>15	But I have put my trust in thee, O Lord: I said: Thou art my God.
<br>16	My lots are in thy hands. Deliver me out of the hands of my enemies; and from them that persecute me.
<br>17	Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; save me in thy mercy.
<br>18	Let me not be confounded, O Lord,   for I have called upon thee. Let the wicked be ashamed, and be brought down to hell.
<br>19	Let deceitful lips be made dumb. Which speak iniquity against the just, with pride and abuse.
<br>20	O how great is the multitude of thy sweet- ness, O Lord, which thou hast hidden for them that fear thee! Which thou hast wrougth for them that hope inthee, in the sight of the sons of men.
<br>21	Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy face, from the disturbance of men. Thoushalt protect them in thy tabernacle form the contra- diction of tongues.
<br>22	Blessed be the Lord, for he hath shewn his wonderful mercy to me in a fortified city.
<br>23	But I said in the excess of my mind: I am cast away from before thy eyes. Therefore thou hast heard the voice of my prayer, when I cried to thee.
<br>24	O love the Lord, all ye his saints: for the Lord will require truth, and will repay them abundantly that act proudly.
<br>25	Do ye manfully, and let your heart be strengthened, all ye that hope in the Lord.
<br>
<br>Chapter 31
<br>To David himself, understanding. Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>2	Blessed is the man to whom the Lord hath not inputed sin, and in whose spirit there is no guile.
<br>3	Because I was silent my bones grew old; whilst I cried out all the day long.
<br>4	For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: I am turned in my anguish, whilst the thorn is fastened.
<br>5	I have acknowledged my sin to thee, and my injustice I have not concealed. I said I will confess against my self my injustice to the Lord: and thou hast forgiven the wickedness of my sin. 6 For this shall every one that is holy pray to thee in a seasonable time. And yet in a flood of many waters, they shall not come nigh unto him. 7 Thou art my fefuge from the trouble which hath eencompassed me: my joy, deliver me from
<br>them that surround me.
<br>8	I will give thee understanding, and I will instruct thee in this way, in which thou shalt go: I will fix my eyes upon thee.
<br>9	Do not become like the horse and the mule, who have no understanding. With bit and bridle bind fast their jaws, who come not near unto thee.
<br>10	Many are the scourges of the sinner, but mercy shall encompass him that hopeth in the Lord.
<br>11	Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, ye just, and glory, all ye right of heart.
<br>
<br>Chapter 32
<br>
<br>A psalm for David. Rejoice in the Lord, O ye just: praise becometh the upright.
<br>2	Give praise to the Lord on the harp; sing to him with the psaltery, the instrument of ten strings.
<br> 
<br>3	Sing to him a new canticle, sing well unto him with a loud noise.
<br>4	For the word of the Lord is right, and all his works are done with faithfulness.
<br>5	He loveth mercy and judgment; the earth is full of the mercy of the Lord.
<br>6	By the word of the Lord the heavens were established; and all the power of them by the spirit of his mouth:
<br>7	Gathering together the waters of the sea, as in a vessel; laying up the depths in storehouses. 8 Let all the earth fear the Lord, and let all
<br>the inhabitants of the world be in awe of him.
<br>9	For he spoke and they were made: he com- manded and they were created.
<br>10	The Lord bringeth to nought the counsels of nations; and he rejecteth the devices of people, and casteth away the counsels of princes.
<br>11	But the counsel of the Lord standeth for ever: the thoughts of his heart to all generations.
<br>12	Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord: the people whom he hath chosen for his inheritance.
<br>13	The Lord hath looked from heaven: he hath beheld all the sons of men.
<br>14	From his habitation which he hath pre- pared, he hath looked upon all that dwell on the earth.
<br>15	He who hath made the hearts of every one of them: who understandeth all their works.
<br>16	The king is not saved by a great army: nor shall the giant be saved by his own great strength.
<br>17	Vain is the horse for safety: neither shall he be saved by the abundance of his strength.
<br>18	Behold the eyes of the Lord are on them that fear him: and on them that hope in his mercy.
<br>19	To deliver their souls from death; and feed them in famine.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>20	Our soul waiteth for the Lord: for he is our helper and protector.
<br>21	For in him our heart shall rejoice: and in his holy name we have trusted.
<br>22	Let thy mercy, O Lord, be upon us, as we have hooped in thee.
<br>
<br>Chapter 33
<br>
<br>For David, when he changed his countenance before Achimelech, who dismissed him, and he went his way. [1 Kings 21.]
<br>2	I will belss the Lord at all times, his praise shall be always in my mouth.
<br>3	In the Lord shall my soul be praised: let the meek hear and rejoice.
<br>4	O magnify the Lord with me; and let us extol his name together.
<br>5	I sought the Lord, and he heard me; and he delivered me from all my troubles.
<br>6	Come ye to him and be enlightened: and your faces shall not be confounded.
<br>7	This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him: and saved him out of all his troubles.
<br>8	The angel of the Lord shall encamp round about them that fear him: and shall deliver them.
<br>9	O taste, and see that the Lord is sweet: blessed is the man that hopeth in him.
<br>10	Fear the Lord, all ye his saints: for there is no want to them that fear him.
<br>11	The rich have wanted, and have suffered hunger: but they that seek the Lord shall not be deprived of any good.
<br>12	Come, children, hearken to me: I will teach you the fear of the Lord.
<br>13	Who is the man that desireth life: who liveth to see good days?
<br> 
<br>14	Keep thy tongue form evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.
<br>15	Tkurn away from evil and do good: seek after peace and pursue it.
<br>16	The eyes of the Lord are upon the just: and his ears unto their prayers.
<br>17	But the countenance of the Lord is against them that do evil things: to cut off the remem- brance of them from the earth.
<br>18	The just cried, and the Lord heard them: and delivered them out of all their troubles.
<br>19	The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a contrite heart: and he will save the humble of spirit.
<br>20	Many are the afflictions of the just; but out of them all will the Lord deliver them.
<br>21	The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a contrite heart: and he will save the humble of spirit.
<br>22	The death of the wicked is very evil: and they that hate the just shall be guilty.
<br>23	The Lord will redeem the souls of his ser- vants: and none of them that trust in him shall offend.
<br>
<br>Chapter 34
<br>
<br>For David himself. Judge thou, O Lord, them that wrong me: overthrow them that fight against me.
<br>2	Take hold of arms and shield: and rise up to help me.
<br>3	Bring out the sword, and shut up the way against them that persecute me: say to my soul: I am thy salvation.
<br>4	Let them be confounded and ashamed that seek after my soul. Let them be turned back and be confounded that devise evil against me.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>5	Let them become as dust before the wind: and let the angel of the Lord straiten them.
<br>6	Let their way become dark and slippery; and let the angel of the Lord pursue them.
<br>7	For without cause they have hidden their net for me unto destruction: without cause they have upbraided my soul.
<br>8	Let the snae which he knoweth not come upon him: and let the net which he hath hidden catch him: and into that very snare let them fall. 9 But my soul shall rejoice in the Lord; and
<br>shall be delighted in his salvation.
<br>10	All my bones shall say: Lord, who is like to thee? Who deliverest the poor from the hand of them that are stronger than he; the needy and the poor from them that strip him.
<br>11	Unjust witnesses rising up have asked me things I knew not.
<br>12	They repaid me evil for good: to the de- priving me of my soul.
<br>13	But as for me, when they were troublesome to me, I was clothed with haircloth. I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer shall be turned into my bosom.
<br>14	As a neighbour and as an own brother, so did I please: as one mourning and sorrowful so was I humbled.
<br>15	But they rejoiced against me, and came together: scourges were gathered together upon me, and I knew not.
<br>16	They were separated, and repented not: they tempted me, they scoffed at me with scorn: they gnashed ukpon me with their teeth.
<br>17	Lord, when wilt thou look upon me? rescue thou my soul from their malice: my only one from the lions.
<br>18	I will give thanks to thee in a great church; I will praise thee in a strong people.
<br>19	Let not them that are my enemies wrong- fully rejoice over me: who have hated me without
<br> 
<br>cause, and wink with the eyes.
<br>20	For they spoke indeed peaceably to me; and speaking in the anger of the earth they devised guile.
<br>21	And they opened their mouth wide against me; they said: Well done, well done, our eyes have seen it.
<br>22	Thou hast seen, O Lord, be not thou silent: O Lord, depart not from me.
<br>23	Arise, and be attentive to my judgment: to my cause, my God, and my Lord.
<br>24	Judge me, O Lord my God according to thy justice, and let them not rejoice over me.
<br>25	Let them not say in their hearts: It is well, it is well, to our mind: neither let them say: We have swallowed him up.
<br>26	Let them blush: and be ashamed to gether, who rejoice at my evils. Let them be clothed with confusion and shame, who speak great things against me.
<br>27	Let them rejoice and be glad, who are well pleased with my justice, and let them say always: The Lord be magnified, who delights in the peace of his servant.
<br>28	And my tongue shall meditate thy justice, thy praise all the day long.
<br>
<br>Chapter 35
<br>Unto the end, for the servant of God, David him- self.
<br>2	The unjust hath said within himself, that he would sin: there is no fear of God before his eyes.
<br>3	For in his sight he hath done deceitfully, that his iniquity may be found unto hatred.
<br>4	The words of his mouth are iniquity and guile: he would not understand that he might do well.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>5	He hath devised iniquity on his bed, he hath set himself on every way that is not good: but evil he hath not hated.
<br>6	O Lord, thy mercy is in heaven, and thy truth reacheth even to the clouds.
<br>7	Thy justice is as the mountains of God, thy judgments are a great deep. Men and beasts thou wilt preserve, O Lord:
<br>8	O how hast thou multiplied thy mercy, O God! But the children of men shall put their trust under the covert of thy wings.
<br>9	They shall be inebriated with the plenty of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the torrent of thy pleasure.
<br>10	For with thee is the fountain of life; and in thy light we shall see light.
<br>11	Extend thy mercy to them that know thee, and thy justice to them that are right in heart.
<br>12	Let not the foot of pride come to me, and let not the hand of the sinner move me.
<br>13	There the workers of iniquity are fallen, they are cast out, and could not stand.
<br>
<br>Chapter 36
<br>Be not emulous of evildoers; nor envy them that work iniquity.
<br>2	For they shall shortly wither away as grass, and as the green herbs shall quickly fall.
<br>3	Trust in the Lord, and do good, and dwell in the land, and thou shalt be fed with its riches. 4 Delight in the Lord, and he will give thee
<br>the requests of thy heart.
<br>5	Commit thy way to the Lord, and trust in him, and he will do it.
<br>6	And he will bring forth thy justice as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday.
<br>7	Be subject to the Lord and pray to him. Envy not the man who prospereth in his way;
<br> 
<br>the man who doth unjust things.
<br>8	Cease from anger, and leave rage; have no emulation to do evil.
<br>9	For evildoers shall be cut off: but they that wait upon the Lord, they shall inherit the land. 10 For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: and thou shalt seek his place, and shalt
<br>not find it.
<br>11	But the meek shall inherit the land, and shall delight in abundance of peace.
<br>12	The sinner shall watch the just man: and shall gnash upon him with his teeth.
<br>13	But the Lord shall laugh at him: for he foreseeth that his day shall come.
<br>14	The wicked have drawn out the sword: they have bent their bow. To cast down the poor and needy, to kill the upright of heart.
<br>15	Let their sword enter into their own hearts, andlet their bow be broken.
<br>16	Better is a little to the just, than the great riches of the wicked.
<br>17	For the arms of the wicked shall be broken in pieces; but the Lord strengtheneth the just.
<br>18	The Lord knoweth the days of the unde- filed; and their inheritance shall be for ever.
<br>19	They shall not be confounded in the evil time; and in the days of famine they shall be filled:
<br>20	Because the wicked shall perish. And the enemies of the Lord, presently after they shall be honoured and exalted, shall come to nothing and vanish like smoke.
<br>21	The sinner shall borrow, and not pay again; but the just sheweth mercy and shall give.
<br>22	For such as bless him shall inherit the land: but such as curse him shall perish.
<br>23	With the Lord shall the steps of a man be directed, and he shall like well his way.
<br>24	When he shall fall he shall not be bruised, for the Lord putteth his hand under him.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>25	I have been young and now am old; and I have not seen the just forsaken, nor his seed seeking bread.
<br>26	He sheweth mercy, and lendeth all the day long; and his seed shall be in blessing.
<br>27	Decline from evil and do good, and dwell for ever and ever.
<br>28	For the Lord loveth judgment, and will not forsake his saints: they shall be preserved for ever. The unjust shall be punished, and the seed of the wicked shall perish.
<br>29	But the just shall inherit the land, and shall dwell therein for evermore.
<br>30	The mouth of the just shall meditate wis- dom: and his tongue shall speak judgment.
<br>31	The law of his God is in his heart, and his steps shall not be supplanted.
<br>32	The wicked watcheth the just man, and seeketh to put him to death,
<br>33	But the Lord will not leave him in his hands; nor condemn him when he shall be judged.
<br>34	Expect the Lord and keep his way: and he will exalt thee to inherit the land: when the sinners shall perish thou shalt see.
<br>35	I have seen the wicked highly exalted, and lifted ukp like the cedars of Libanus.
<br>36	And I passed by, and lo, he was not: and I sought him and his place was not found.
<br>37	Keep innocence, and behold justice: for there are remnants for the peaceable man.
<br>38	But the unjust shall be destroyed to gether: the remnants of the wicked shall perish.
<br>39	But the salvation of the just is from the Lord, and he is their protector in the time of trouble.
<br>40	And the Lord will help them and deliver them: and he will rescue them from the wicked, and save them because they have hoped in him.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 37
<br>
<br>A psalm for David, for a remembrance of the sabbath.
<br>2	Rebuke me not, O Lord, in thy indignation; nor chastise me in thy wrath.
<br>3	For thy arrows are fastened in me: and thy hand hath been strong upon me.
<br>4	There is no health in my flesh, because of thy wrath: there is no peace for my bones, because of my sins.
<br>5	For my iniquities are gone over my head: and as a heavy burden are become heavy upon me.
<br>6	My sores are putrified and corrupted, be- cause of my foolishness.
<br>7	I am bcome miserable, and am bowed down even to the end: I walked sorrowfull all the day long.
<br>8	For my loins are filled with illusions; and there isno health in my flesh.
<br>9	I am afflicted and humbled exceedingly: I roared with the groaning of my heart.
<br>10	Lord, all my desire is before thee, and my groaning is not hidden from thee.
<br>11	My heart is troubled, my strength hath left me, and the light of my eyes itself is not with me. 12 My friends and my neighbours have drawn near, and stood against me. And they that were
<br>near me stood afar off:
<br>13 And they that sought my soul used vio- lence. And they that sought evils to me spoke vain things, and studied deceits all the day long. 14 But I, as a deaf man, heard not: and as a
<br>dumb man not opening his mouth.
<br>15	And I became as a man that heareth not: and that hath no reproofs in his mouth.
<br>16	For in thee, O Lord, have I hoped: thou wilt hear me, O Lord my God.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>17	For I said: Lest at any time my enemies rejoice over me: and whilst my feet are moved, they speak great things against me.
<br>18	For I am ready for scourges: and my sorrow is continually before me.
<br>19	For I will declare my iniquity: and I will think formy sin.
<br>20	But my enemies live, and are stronger than I: and they that hate me wrongfully are ultiplied. 21 They that render evil for good, have de-
<br>tracted me, because I followed goodness.
<br>22	For sake me not, O Lord my God: do not thou depart from me.
<br>23	Attend unto my help, O Lord, the God of my salvation.
<br>
<br>Chapter 38
<br>
<br>Unto the end, for Idithun himself, a canticle of David.
<br>2	I said: I will take heed to my ways: that I sin not with my tongue. I have set a guard to my mouth, when the sinner stood against me.
<br>3	I was dumb, and was humbled, and kept silence from good things: and my sorrow was renewed.
<br>4	My heart grew hot within me: and in my meditqation a fire shall flame out.
<br>5	I spoke with my tongue: O Lord, make me know my end. And what is the number of my days: that I may know what is wanting to me.
<br>6	Behold thou hast made my days measurable. and my substance is as nothing before thee. And indeed all things are vantiy: every man living.
<br>7	Surely man passeth as an image: yea, and he is disquieted in vain. He storeth up: and he knoweth not for whom he shall gather these things.
<br> 
<br>8	And now what is my hope? is it not the Lord? and my substance is with thee.
<br>9	Deliver thou me from all my iniquities: thou hast made me a reproach to the fool.
<br>10	I was dumb, and I opened not my mouth, because thou hast done it.
<br>11	Remove thy scourges from me. The strength of thy hand hath made me faint in re- bukes:
<br>12	Thou hast corrected man for iniquity. And thou hast made his soul to waste away like a spider: surely in vain is any man disquieted.
<br>13	Hear my prayer, O Lord, and my supplica- tion: give ear to my tears. Be no silent: for I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner as all my fathers were.
<br>14	O forgive me, that I may be refreshed, be- fore I go hence, and be no more.
<br>
<br>Chapter 39
<br>Unto the end, a psalm for David himself.
<br>2	With expectation I have waited for the Lord, and he was attentive to me.
<br>3	And he heard my prayers, and brought me out of the pit of misery and the mire of dregs. And he set my feet upon a rock, and directed my steps.
<br>4	And he put a new canticle into my mouth, a song to our God. Many shall see, and shall fear: and they shall hope in the Lord.
<br>5	Blessed is the man whose trust is in the name of the Lord; and who hath not had regard to vanities, and lying follies.
<br>6	Thou hast multiplied thy wonderful works, O Lord my God: and in thy thoughts there is no one like to thee. I have declared and I have spoken they are multiplied above number.
<br>7	Sacrifice and oblation thou didst not desire;
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>but thou hast pierced ears for me. Burnt offering and sin offering thou didst not require:
<br>8	Then said I, Behold I come. In the head of the book it is written of me
<br>9	That I should do thy will: O my God, I have desired it, and thy law in the midst of my heart.
<br>10	I have declared thy justice in a great church, lo, I will not restrain my lips: O Lord, thou knowest it.
<br>11	I have not hid thy justice within my heart: I have declared thy truth and thy salvation. I have not concealed thy mercy and thy truth from a great council.
<br>12	Withhold not thou, O Lord, thy tender mercies from me: thy mercy and thy truth have always upheld me.
<br>13	For evils without number have surrounded me; my iniquities have overtaken me, and I was not able to see. They are multiplied above the hairs of my head: and my heart hath forsaken me.
<br>14	Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me. look down, O Lord, to help me.
<br>15	Let them be confounded and ashamed to- gether, that seek after my soul to take it away. Let them be turned backward and be ashamed that desire evils to me.
<br>16	Let them immediately bear their confusion, that say to me: ’T is well, t’ is well.
<br>17	Let all that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let such as love thy salvation say always: The Lord be magnified.
<br>18	But I am a beggar and poor:   the Lord is careful for me. Thou art my helper and my protector: O my God, be not slack.
<br>
<br>Chapter 40
<br>Unto the end, a psalm for David himself.
<br> 
<br>2	Blessed is he that understandeth concerning the needy and the poor: the Lord will deliver him in the evil day.
<br>3	The Lord preserve him and give him life, and make him blessed upon the earth: and deliver him not up to the will of his enemies.
<br>4	The Lord help him on his bed of sorrow: thou hast turned all his couch in his sickness.
<br>5	I said: O Lord, be thou merciful to me: heal my soul, for I have sinned against thee.
<br>6	My enemies have spoken evils against me: when shall he die and his name perish?
<br>7	And if he came in to see me, he spoke vain things: his heart gathered together iniquity to itself. He went out and spoke to the same pur- pose.
<br>8	All my enemies whispered together against me: they devised evils to me.
<br>9	They determined against me an unjust word: shall he that sleepeth rise again no more?
<br>10	For even the man of my peace, in whom I trusted, who ate my bread, hath greatly sup- planted me.
<br>11	But thou, O Lord, have mercy on me, and raise my up again: and I will requite them.
<br>12	By this I know, that thou hast had a good will for me: because my enemy shall not rejoice over me.
<br>13	But thou hast upheldme by reason of my innocence: and hast established me in thy sight for ever.
<br>14	Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel from eternity to eternity. So be it. So be it.
<br>
<br>Chapter 41
<br>
<br>Unto the end, understanding for the sons of Core.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>2	As the hart panteth after the fountains of water; so my soul panteth after thee, O God.
<br>3	My soul hath thirsted after the strong living God; when shall I come and appear before the face of God?
<br>4	My tears have been my bread day and night, whilst it is said to me daily: Where is thy God?
<br>5	These things I remembered, and poured out my soul in me: for I shall go over into the place of the wonderful tabernacle, even to the house of God: With the voice of joy and praise; the noise of one feasting.
<br>6	Why art thou sad, O my soul? and why dost thou trouble me? Hope in God, for I will still give praise to him: the salvation of my coun- tenance,
<br>7	And my God. My soul is troubled within my self: therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan and Hermoniim, from the little hill.
<br>8	Deep calleth on deep, at the noise of thy flood-gates. All thy heights and thy billows have passed over me.
<br>9	In the daytime the Lord hath commanded hismercy; and a canticle to him in the night. With me is prayer to the God of my life.
<br>10	I will say to God: Thou art my support. Why hast thou forgotten me? and why go I mourning, whilst my enemy afflicteth me?
<br>11	Whilst my bones are broken, my enemies who troubleme have reproached me; Whilst they say to me day be day: Where is thy God?
<br>12	Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why dost thou disquiet me? Hope thou in God, for I will still give praise to him: the salvation of my countenance, and my God.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 42
<br>A psalm for David. Judge me, O God, and dis- tinguish my cause from the nation that is not holy: deliver me from the unjust and deceitful man.
<br>2	For thou art God my strrength: why hast thou cast me off? and why do I go sorrowful whilst the enemy afflicteth me?
<br>3	Sent forth thy light and thy truth: they have conducted me, and brought me unto thy holy hill, and into thy tabernacles.
<br>4	And I will go in to the altar of God: to God who giveth joy to my youth.
<br>5	To thee, O God my God, I will give praise upon the harp: why art thou sad, O my soul? and why dost thou disquiet me?
<br>6	Hope in God, for I will still give pralise to him: the salvation of my countenance, and my God.
<br>
<br>Chapter 43
<br>Unto the end, for the sons of Core, to give un- derstanding.
<br>2	We have heard, O God, with our ears: our fathers have declared to us, The work thou hast wrought in their days, and in the days of old.
<br>3	Thy hand destroyed the Gentiles, and thou plantedst them: thou didst aflict the people and cast them out.
<br>4	For they got not the possession of the land by their own sword: neither did their own arm save them. But thy right hand and thy arm, and the light of thy countenance: because thou wast pleased with them.
<br>5	Thou art thyself my king andmy God, who commandest the saving of Jacob.
<br>6	Through thee we will push down our enemies
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>with the horn: and through thy name we will despise them that rise up against us.
<br>7	For I will not trust in my bow: neither shall my sword save me.
<br>8	But thou hast saved us from them that afflict us: and hast put them to shame that hate us.
<br>9	In God shall we glory all the day long: and in thy name we will give praise for ever.
<br>10	But now thou hast cast us off, and put us to shame: and thou , O God, wilt not go out with our armies.
<br>11	Thou hast made kus turn our back to our enemies: and they that hated us plundered for themselves.
<br>12	Thou hast given us up like sheep to be eaten: thou hast scattered us among the nations. 13 Thou hast sold thy people for no price: and there was no reckoning in the exchange of them. 14 Thou hast made us a reproach to our neigh- bours, a scoff and derision to them that are
<br>round about us.
<br>15	Thou hast made us a byword among the Gentiles: a shaking of the head among the peo- ple.
<br>16	All the day long myu shame is before me: and the confusion of my face hath covered me,
<br>17	At the voice of him that reproacheth and detracteth me: at the face of the enemy and per- secutor.
<br>18	All these things have come upon us, yet we have not forgotten thee: and we have not done wickedly in thy covenant.
<br>19	And our heart hath not turned back: nei- ther hast thou turned aside our steps from thy way.
<br>20	For thou hast humbled us in the place of affliction: and the shadow of death hath covered us.
<br>21	If we have forgotten the name of our God, and if we have spread forth our hands to a
<br> 
<br>strange god:
<br>22	Shall not God search out thesethings: for he knoweth the secrets of the heart. Because for thy sake we are killed all the day long: we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.
<br>23	Arise, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, and cast us not off to the end.
<br>24	Why turnest thou thy face away? and for- gettest our want and our trouble?
<br>25	For our soul is humbled down to the dust: our belly cleaveth to the earth.
<br>26	Arise, O Lord, help us and redeem us for thy name’s sake.
<br>
<br>Chapter 44
<br>Unto the end, for them that shall be changed, for the sons of Core, for understanding. A canticle for the Beloved.
<br>2	My heart hath uttered a good word: I speak my works to the king: My tongue is the pen of a scrivener that writeth swiftly.
<br>3	Thou art beautiful above the sons of men: grace is poured abroad in thy lips; therefore hath God blessed thee for ever.
<br>4	Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O thou most mighty.
<br>5	With thy comeliness and thy beauty set out, proceed prosperously, and reign.   Because of truth and meekness and justice: and thy right hand shall conduct thee wonderfully.
<br>6	Thy arrows are sharp: under thee shall peo- ple fall, into the hearts of the king’s enemies.
<br>7	Thy throne, O God, is forever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a sceptre of upright- ness.
<br>8	Thou hast loved justice, and hated iniquity: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>9	Myrrh and stacte and cassia perfume thy garments, from the ivory houses: out of which
<br>10	The daughters of kings have delighted thee in thy glory. The queen stood on thy right hand, in gilded clothing; surrounded with variety.
<br>11	Hearken, O daughter, and see, and incline thy ear: and forget thy people and thy father’s house.
<br>12	And the king shall greatly desire thy beauty; for he is the Lord thy God, and him they shall adore.
