<br>§12302. Standard numbering system
<br>
<br>(a) The Secretary shall prescribe by regulation a standard numbering system for vessels to which this chapter applies. On application by a State, the Secretary shall approve a State numbering system that is consistent with the standard numbering system. In carrying out its numbering system, a State shall adopt any definitions of relevant terms prescribed by regulations of the Secretary.
<br>
<br>(b) A State with an approved numbering system is the issuing authority within the meaning of this chapter. The Secretary is the issuing authority in a State in which a State numbering system has not been approved.
<br>
<br>(c) When a vessel is numbered in a State, it is deemed in compliance with the numbering system of a State in which it temporarily is operated.
<br>
<br>(d) When a vessel is removed to a new State of principal operation, the issuing authority of that State shall recognize the validity of the number issued by the original State for 60 days.
<br>
<br>(e) If a State has a numbering system approved after the Secretary issues a number, the State shall recognize the validity of the number issued by the Secretary for one year.
<br>
<br>(f) When the Secretary decides that a State numbering system is not being carried out consistent with the standard numbering system or the State has changed the system without the Secretary's approval, the Secretary may withdraw approval after giving notice to the State, in writing, stating the reasons for the withdrawal.

<br>§12304. Certificates of numbers
<br>
<br>(a) A certificate of number is granted for a number issued under this chapter. The certificate shall be pocketsized, shall be at all times available for inspection on the vessel for which issued when the vessel is in operation, and may be valid for not more than 3 years. The certificate of number for a vessel less than 26 feet in length and leased or rented to another for the latter's noncommercial operation of less than 7 days may be retained on shore by the vessel's owner or representative at the place from which the vessel departs or returns to the possession of the owner or the owner's representative. A vessel that does not have the certificate of number on board shall be identified when in operation, and comply with requirements, as the issuing authority prescribes.
<br>
<br>(b) The owner of a vessel numbered under this chapter shall provide—
<br>
<br>(1) the issuing authority notice of the transfer of any part of the owner's interest in the vessel or of the destruction or abandonment of the vessel, within a reasonable time after the transfer, destruction, or abandonment; and
<br>
<br>(2) notice of a change of address within a reasonable time of the change, as prescribed by regulation.

<br>
<br>(c) When a civil penalty of not more than $200 has been assessed under this chapter, the Secretary may refer the matter of collection of the penalty directly to the United States magistrate judge of the jurisdiction in which the person liable may be found for collection procedures under supervision of the district court and under an order issued by the court delegating this authority under section 636(b) of title 28.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Section 101 of H.R. 3105, as amended, adds a new chapter 125 to title 46, United States Code, to establish a vessel identification system for all vessels of the United States. This would include vessels documented under chapter 121 of title 46, numbered under chapter 123 of that title, or titled under the law of a State. This new chapter consists of new sections 12501–12507 as follows.
<br>§12501. Establishment of a vessel identification system
<br>
<br>(a) The Secretary of Transportation shall establish a vessel identification system to make available information under section 12503 of this title for use by the public for law enforcement and other purposes relating to—
<br>
<br>(1) the ownership of documented vessels;
<br>
<br>(2) the ownership of vessels numbered under chapter 123 of this title; and
<br>
<br>(3) the ownership of vessels titled under the law of a State.
<br>
<br>(b) The vessel identification system shall include information prescribed by the Secretary including—
<br>
<br>(1) identifying a vessel;
<br>
<br>(2) identifying the owner of the vessel, including—
<br>
<br>(A) the owner's social security number or, if that number is not available, other means of identification acceptable to the Secretary; or
<br>
<br>(B) for an owner other than an individual—
<br>
<br>(i) the owner's taxpayer identification number; or
<br>
<br>(ii) if the owner does not have a taxpayer identification number, the social security number of an individual who is a corporate officer, general partner, or individual trustee of the owner and who signed the application for documentation or numbering for the vessel;
<br>
<br>(3) identifying the State in which it is titled or numbered;
<br>
<br>(4) indicating whether the vessel is numbered or titled, or both;
<br>
<br>(5) if titled in a State, indicating where evidence of a lien or other security interest may be found against the vessel in that State; and
<br>
<br>(6) information assisting law enforcement officials.
<br>
<br>(c) The Secretary may maintain information under this chapter in connection with any other information system maintained by the Secretary.
<br>
<br>(Added Pub. L. 100–710, title I, §101(a), Nov. 23, 1988, 102 Stat. 4735; amended Pub. L. 101–225, title III, §302(1), Dec. 12, 1989, 103 Stat. 1922; Pub. L. 101–595, title VI, §603(10), Nov. 16, 1990, 104 Stat. 2993.)
<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>Revised section 12501
<br>
<br>Subsection (a) of section 12501 requires the Secretary of Transportation to establish a system of information concerning vessels of the United States for law enforcement and other purposes. The Secretary is required to make available information from the system relating to the ownership of vessels documented under chapter 121 of title 46, numbered under chapter 123 of that title, and titled under the law of a State. The information is available under section 12503 for use by the public, similarly under the Ship Mortgage Act, 1920.
<br>
<br>Subsection (b) lists the vessel identification information which is required to be maintained by the Secretary. The Secretary has the authority to prescribe other information to be maintained in addition to the items listed. For example, the Secretary may identify vessels issued fisheries permits by the Department of Commerce. The Secretary may also monitor transactions involving vessels that require approval by the Secretary under section 9 of the Shipping Act, 1916 (46 App. U.S.C. 808) before interest or control in the vessel may be transferred to a noncitizen.
<br>
<br>Subsection (c) clarifies that the Secretary has the flexibility to maintain this system in connection with any other information system maintained by the Secretary, including the Federal Aviation Administration system containing aircraft ownership information. This would also permit the Secretary to combine various systems and data bases maintained by the Secretary such as documentation and numbering of vessels, and safety, casualty, and law enforcement statistics.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>Revised section 12502
<br>
<br>Subsection (a) of this section requires the Secretary to maintain a unique numbering system for vessels of the United States. The Secretary may use existing vessel numbering systems such as the hull identification number for this purpose, but must ensure that no two existing vessels of the United States have the same number. The Secretary should consider and propose the use of a 17-digit number to implement this requirement. This subsection also requires the Secretary to maintain a system of signal letters and to record vessel names for documented vessels. The Secretary is authorized to establish other vessel identification markings for vessels of the United States, such as hailing ports.
<br>
<br>Subsections (b), (c), (d), and (e) contain other requirements and restrictions concerning vessel identification markings.
<br>
<br>This section consolidates the requirements of sections 12114, 12115, 12116, and 12118 of title 46. For this reason, section 106 of this bill repeals those sections.

<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>Revised section 12503
<br>
<br>Subsection (a) of section 12503 allows a State or approved State delegee to make vessel identification information available to the Secretary. Participation in the system is voluntary on the part of a State. A benefit to boat purchasers and financiers in States with approved titling systems participating in this system is that vessel mortgages or financing instruments made in those States are deemed to be preferred mortgages under chapter 313 of title 46, United States Code (as codified and enacted by this Act).
<br>
<br>Under subsection (a), the Secretary may prescribe the manner and form in which the information is made available by the States. In this regard, the Committee intends that the Secretary employ the most efficient, up-to-date computer technology in maintaining information made available from the States to avoid duplication of effort in maintaining information and to reduce the costs of the system. In addition to the vessel identification information made available by States under paragraphs (1)–(6), the Secretary and a State may agree that the State make available other information. For example, the purpose for which a vessel is routinely used would be valuable information for the system.
<br>
<br>The Committee intends that most of the information in the system will become available directly and exclusively from the States to the greatest extent possible. However, under subsection (b), the Secretary may accept information from others under conditions and in a manner and form prescribed by the Secretary. Thus, if the Secretary discovers a valuable and reliable source of data that can be conveniently made available to the system, the Secretary can approve it.
<br>
<br>Under paragraph (c)(1), the Secretary must maintain information on a State-titled vessel with a preferred mortgage that moves to a nonparticipating, nontitle State, until the mortgage is discharged or the vessel is sold. Under paragraph (c)(2), the Secretary must accept information submitted under section 31321 of title 46 (as enacted by this Act) concerning a discharge of a preferred mortgage on a vessel title under State law. This would be necessary if the vessel moves to a nonparticipating State, and information on that vessel would not be provided to the system by that State. This subsection will allow the Secretary to keep the vessel information system current on these matters and purge files no longer required to be maintained.

<br>For law enforcement or other purposes and under conditions prescribed by the Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary—
<br>
<br>(1) shall make available information in the vessel identification system to a State making information available under section 12503(a) of this title; and
<br>
<br>(2) may make available information in the vessel identification system to others.
<br>
<br>(Added Pub. L. 100–710, title I, §101(a), Nov. 23, 1988, 102 Stat. 4736; amended Pub. L. 101–225, title III, §302(3), Dec. 12, 1989, 103 Stat. 1923.)
<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>Revised section 12504
<br>
<br>This section requires that the Secretary make available information maintained in the vessel identification system to a State participating in the system for law enforcement or other purposes. The Secretary may make available information in the system to others, under conditions the Secretary may prescribe. At first, the Secretary may elect to deal only with the States. However, the Committee firmly expects that information will be made available through computer terminals in satellite offices or direct computer access by modem. In this manner, boating organizations or financial or documentation services could retrieve data without paper transactions for a fee.

<br>Section effective Jan. 1, 1989, with certain exceptions and qualifications, see section 107 of Pub. L. 100–710, set out as a note under section 31301 of this title.
<br>§12505. Fees
<br>
<br>(a) The Secretary of Transportation may charge a fee under section 9701 of title 31 for providing information to or requesting information from the vessel identification system, except to—
<br>
<br>(1) an agency; or
<br>
<br>(2) a State making information available to the Secretary under section 12503(a) of this title.
<br>
<br>(b) The Secretary shall deposit amounts transferred or collected under this section in the general fund of the Treasury as proprietary receipts of the Secretary and ascribed to the vessel identification system.
<br>
<br>(Added Pub. L. 100–710, title I, §101(a), Nov. 23, 1988, 102 Stat. 4737; amended Pub. L. 101–595, title VI, §603(11), Nov. 16, 1990, 104 Stat. 2993.)
<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>Revised section 12505
<br>
<br>This section contains the authority for the Secretary to charge a fee under the user charge law, 31 U.S.C. 9701, for providing information to or requesting information from the vessel identification system. Fees may not be charged under this subsection to an agency or a State that is participating in the vessel identification system maintained by the Secretary.
<br>
<br>Under subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary may collect an annual fee of not more than $1.00 from the owner of a vessel of the United States under 31 U.S.C. 9701 for the vessel identification system. Since vessel owners will benefit from the vessel identification system, such as from documentation of ownership data and stolen vessel tracking, this fee is designed as a maintenance charge to owners for this service. The collection of the annual fee may be delayed by the Secretary, and an agency, State, or person may be employed to collect the fee under subsection (c). The Committee expects that the Secretary will make agreements with States to collect this fee at the time of vessel registrations. The term of these registrations varies from one to three years as permitted by chapter 123 of title 46.
<br>
<br>Under subsection (d) of this section, if a State is employed to collect the fee, the State may retain one-half of the amounts collected, and must transfer the remainder to the Secretary. The amounts retained by a State may be used to cover the costs of making vessel identification information available to the Secretary. This includes upgrading or establishing titling systems as well as making improvements and other changes to vessel numbering systems to make information available. Because States are allowed to make improvements to their vessel titling and numbering systems with the amounts retained under this section, the costs of those programs may decrease. This could result in a corresponding decrease in State numbering fees and offset vessel identification system fees paid by vessel owners.

<br>
<br>1990—Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 101–595 redesignated subsec. (e) as (b) and struck out former subsec. (b) which read as follows: "In addition to any fee under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary may collect an annual fee of not more than $1.00 from the owner of each vessel of the United States under section 9701 of title 31 for maintaining the vessel identification system. However, the collection of that fee may be delayed under conditions prescribed by the Secretary."
<br>
<br>Subsecs. (c), (d). Pub. L. 101–595 struck out subsecs. (c) and (d) which read as follows:
<br>
<br>"(c) The Secretary may employ any agency, State, or person to collect the fee established under subsection (b) of this section.
<br>
<br>"(d) If a State is employed to collect a fee under subsection (c) of this section, the State may retain one-half of the amounts collected. A State shall transfer one-half of the amounts collected under subsection (b) of this section to the Secretary."

<br>
<br>Editorial Notes
<br>Amendments
<br>
<br>2018—Pub. L. 115–282, title VI, §601(c)(4)(A), Dec. 4, 2018, 132 Stat. 4289, struck out item 13110 "National Boating Safety Advisory Council".
<br>
<br>2006—Pub. L. 109–304, §16(b)(3), Oct. 6, 2006, 120 Stat. 1705, added item 13101 and redesignated former items 13101 to 13106 as 13102 to 13107, respectively.
<br>
<br>1998—Pub. L. 105–178, title VII, §7405(c)(2), June 9, 1998, 112 Stat. 488, substituted "appropriations" for "contract spending" in item 13106.
<br>
<br>1984—Pub. L. 98–369, div. A, title X, §1016(c)(2), July 18, 1984, 98 Stat. 1020, struck out item 13107 "National Recreational Boating Safety and Facilities Improvement Fund".
<br>§13101. Definitions
<br>
<br>In this chapter:
<br>
<br>(1) Eligible State.—The term "eligible State" means a State that has a State recreational boating safety program accepted by the Secretary.
<br>
<br>(2) State Recreational Boating Safety Program.—The term "State recreational boating safety program" means education, assistance, and enforcement activities conducted for maritime casualty prevention, reduction, and reporting for recreational boating.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 109–304, §16(b)(2), Oct. 6, 2006, 120 Stat. 1705.)
<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>Section 16 of the bill [H.R. 1442, which became Pub. L. 109–304] moves the definitions relating to the recreational boating safety program from section 2102(a)(1) and (3) to chapter 131 because the terms only appear in chapter 131.
<br>
<br>Section 16 of the bill also eliminates the special definitions of "State" and "United States" in section 2102(a)(2) as including the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands because the Trust Territory has been terminated. See the definitions of "State" and "United States" in section 2101, which are being moved to chapter 1 and being made applicable title-wide. Those definitions already include the Northern Mariana Islands, the only component of the former Trust Territory still under United States sovereignty.

<br>§13102. State recreational boating safety programs
<br>
<br>(a) To encourage greater State participation and uniformity in boating safety efforts, and particularly to permit the States to assume the greater share of boating safety education, assistance, and enforcement activities, the Secretary shall carry out a national recreational boating safety program. Under this program, the Secretary shall make contracts with, and allocate and distribute amounts to, eligible States to assist them in developing, carrying out, and financing State recreational boating safety programs.
<br>
<br>(b) The Secretary shall establish guidelines and standards for the program. In doing so, the Secretary—
<br>
<br>(1) shall consider, among other things, factors affecting recreational boating safety by contributing to overcrowding and congestion of waterways, such as the increasing number of recreational vessels operating on those waterways and their geographic distribution, the availability and geographic distribution of recreational boating facilities in and among applying States, and State marine casualty and fatality statistics for recreational vessels;
<br>
<br>(2) shall consult with the Secretary of the Interior to minimize duplication with the purposes and expenditures of chapter 2003 of title 54, United States Code,1 the Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Act of 1950 (16 U.S.C. 777–777k), and with the guidelines developed under those Acts; and
<br>
<br>(3) shall maintain environmental standards consistent with the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1451–1464) and other laws and policies of the United States intended to safeguard the ecological and esthetic quality of the waters and wetlands of the United States.
<br>
<br>(c) A State whose recreational boating safety program has been approved by the Secretary is eligible for allocation and distribution of amounts under this chapter to assist that State in developing, carrying out, and financing its program. Matching amounts shall be allocated and distributed among eligible States by the Secretary as provided by section 13104 of this title.

<br>§13103. Program acceptance
<br>
<br>(a) The Secretary shall make a contract with, and allocate and distribute amounts from the Sport Fish Restoration and Boating Trust Fund established by section 9504 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 9504) to, a State that has an approved State recreational boating safety program, if the State demonstrates to the Secretary's satisfaction that—
<br>
<br>(1) the program submitted by that State is consistent with this chapter and chapters 61 and 123 of this title;
<br>
<br>(2) amounts distributed will be used to develop and carry out a State recreational boating safety program containing the minimum requirements of subsection (c) of this section;
<br>
<br>(3) sufficient State matching amounts are available from general State revenue, undocumented vessel numbering and license fees, State marine fuels taxes, or from a fund constituted from the proceeds of those taxes and established to finance a State recreational boating safety program; and
<br>
<br>(4) the program submitted by that State designates a State lead authority or agency that will carry out or coordinate carrying out the State recreational boating safety program supported by financial assistance of the United States Government in that State, including the requirement that the designated State authority or agency submit required reports that are necessary and reasonable to carry out properly and efficiently the program and that are in the form prescribed by the Secretary.
<br>
<br>(b) Amounts of the Government (except amounts from sources referred to in subsection (a)(3) of this section) may not be used to provide a State's share of the costs of the program described under this section. State matching amounts committed to a program under this chapter may not be used to constitute the State's share of matching amounts required by another program of the Government.
<br>
<br>(c) The Secretary shall approve a State recreational boating safety program, and the program is eligible to receive amounts authorized to be expended under section 13107 of this title, if the program includes—
<br>
<br>(1) a vessel numbering system approved or carried out by the Secretary under chapter 123 of this title;
<br>
<br>(2) a cooperative boating safety assistance program with the Coast Guard in that State;
<br>
<br>(3) sufficient patrol and other activity to ensure adequate enforcement of applicable State boating safety laws and regulations;
<br>
<br>(4) an adequate State boating safety education program, that includes the dissemination of information concerning the hazards of operating a vessel when under the influence of alcohol or drugs; and
<br>
<br>(5) a system, approved by the Secretary, for reporting marine casualties required under section 6102 of this title.
<br>
<br>(d) The Secretary's approval under this section is a contractual obligation of the Government for the payment of a proportionate share of the cost of carrying out the program.

<br>
<br>(1) During the second quarter of a fiscal year and on the basis of computations made under section 13106 of this title and submitted by the States for the preceding fiscal year, the Secretary shall determine the percentage of the amounts available to which each eligible State is entitled for the next fiscal year.
<br>

<br>
<br>(3) If the Secretary determines that an amount made available to a State for a prior fiscal year is greater or less than the amount that should have been made available to the State for the prior fiscal year, because of later or more accurate State expenditure information, the amount for the current fiscal year may be increased or decreased by the appropriate amount.
<br>
<br>(b) The Secretary shall schedule the payment of amounts, consistent with the program purposes and applicable regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of amounts from the Treasury and the subsequent disbursement of the amounts by a State.
<br>
<br>(c) The Secretary shall notify a State authority or agency that further payments will be made to the State only when the program complies with the prescribed standards or a failure to comply substantially with standards is corrected if the Secretary, after reasonable notice to the designated State authority or agency, finds that—
<br>
<br>(1) the State recreational boating safety program submitted by the State and accepted by the Secretary has been so changed that it no longer complies with this chapter or standards prescribed by regulations; or
<br>
<br>(2) in carrying out the State recreational boating safety program, there has been a failure to comply substantially with the standards prescribed by regulations.
<br>
<br>(d) The Secretary shall provide for the accounting, budgeting, and other fiscal procedures that are necessary and reasonable to carry out this section properly and efficiently. Records related to amounts allocated under this chapter shall be made available to the Secretary and the Comptroller General to conduct audits.
