<br>§1503. Denial of rights and privileges as national
<br>(a) Proceedings for declaration of United States nationality
<br>
<br>If any person who is within the United States claims a right or privilege as a national of the United States and is denied such right or privilege by any department or independent agency, or official thereof, upon the ground that he is not a national of the United States, such person may institute an action under the provisions of section 2201 of title 28 against the head of such department or independent agency for a judgment declaring him to be a national of the United States, except that no such action may be instituted in any case if the issue of such person's status as a national of the United States (1) arose by reason of, or in connection with any removal proceeding under the provisions of this chapter or any other act, or (2) is in issue in any such removal proceeding. An action under this subsection may be instituted only within five years after the final administrative denial of such right or privilege and shall be filed in the district court of the United States for the district in which such person resides or claims a residence, and jurisdiction over such officials in such cases is conferred upon those courts.
<br>(b) Application for certificate of identity; appeal
<br>
<br>If any person who is not within the United States claims a right or privilege as a national of the United States and is denied such right or privilege by any department or independent agency, or official thereof, upon the ground that he is not a national of the United States, such person may make application to a diplomatic or consular officer of the United States in the foreign country in which he is residing for a certificate of identity for the purpose of traveling to a port of entry in the United States and applying for admission. Upon proof to the satisfaction of such diplomatic or consular officer that such application is made in good faith and has a substantial basis, he shall issue to such person a certificate of identity. From any denial of an application for such certificate the applicant shall be entitled to an appeal to the Secretary of State, who, if he approves the denial, shall state in writing his reasons for his decision. The Secretary of State shall prescribe rules and regulations for the issuance of certificates of identity as above provided. The provisions of this subsection shall be applicable only to a person who at some time prior to his application for the certificate of identity has been physically present in the United States, or to a person under sixteen years of age who was born abroad of a United States citizen parent.
<br>(c) Application for admission to United States under certificate of identity; revision of determination
<br>
<br>A person who has been issued a certificate of identity under the provisions of subsection (b), and while in possession thereof, may apply for admission to the United States at any port of entry, and shall be subject to all the provisions of this chapter relating to the conduct of proceedings involving aliens seeking admission to the United States. A final determination by the Attorney General that any such person is not entitled to admission to the United States shall be subject to review by any court of competent jurisdiction in habeas corpus proceedings and not otherwise. Any person described in this section who is finally denied admission to the United States shall be subject to all the provisions of this chapter relating to aliens seeking admission to the United States.

<br>§1522. Authorization for programs for domestic resettlement of and assistance to refugees
<br>(a) Conditions and considerations
<br>
<br>(1)(A) In providing assistance under this section, the Director shall, to the extent of available appropriations, (i) make available sufficient resources for employment training and placement in order to achieve economic self-sufficiency among refugees as quickly as possible, (ii) provide refugees with the opportunity to acquire sufficient English language training to enable them to become effectively resettled as quickly as possible, (iii) insure that cash assistance is made available to refugees in such a manner as not to discourage their economic self-sufficiency, in accordance with subsection (e)(2), and (iv) insure that women have the same opportunities as men to participate in training and instruction.
<br>
<br>(B) It is the intent of Congress that in providing refugee assistance under this section—
<br>
<br>(i) employable refugees should be placed on jobs as soon as possible after their arrival in the United States;
<br>
<br>(ii) social service funds should be focused on employment-related services, English-as-a-second-language training (in nonwork hours where possible), and case-management services; and
<br>
<br>(iii) local voluntary agency activities should be conducted in close cooperation and advance consultation with State and local governments.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) The Director and the Federal agency administering subsection (b)(1) shall consult regularly (not less often than quarterly) with State and local governments and private nonprofit voluntary agencies concerning the sponsorship process and the intended distribution of refugees among the States and localities before their placement in those States and localities.
<br>
<br>(B) The Director shall develop and implement, in consultation with representatives of voluntary agencies and State and local governments, policies and strategies for the placement and resettlement of refugees within the United States.
<br>
<br>(C) Such policies and strategies, to the extent practicable and except under such unusual circumstances as the Director may recognize, shall—
<br>
<br>(i) insure that a refugee is not initially placed or resettled in an area highly impacted (as determined under regulations prescribed by the Director after consultation with such agencies and governments) by the presence of refugees or comparable populations unless the refugee has a spouse, parent, sibling, son, or daughter residing in that area,
<br>
<br>(ii) provide for a mechanism whereby representatives of local affiliates of voluntary agencies regularly (not less often than quarterly) meet with representatives of State and local governments to plan and coordinate in advance of their arrival the appropriate placement of refugees among the various States and localities, and
<br>
<br>(iii) take into account—
<br>
<br>(I) the proportion of refugees and comparable entrants in the population in the area,
<br>
<br>(II) the availability of employment opportunities, affordable housing, and public and private resources (including educational, health care, and mental health services) for refugees in the area,
<br>
<br>(III) the likelihood of refugees placed in the area becoming self-sufficient and free from long-term dependence on public assistance, and
<br>
<br>(IV) the secondary migration of refugees to and from the area that is likely to occur.
<br>
<br>(D) With respect to the location of placement of refugees within a State, the Federal agency administering subsection (b)(1) shall, consistent with such policies and strategies and to the maximum extent possible, take into account recommendations of the State.
<br>
<br>(3) In the provision of domestic assistance under this section, the Director shall make a periodic assessment, based on refugee population and other relevant factors, of the relative needs of refugees for assistance and services under this subchapter and the resources available to meet such needs. The Director shall compile and maintain data on secondary migration of refugees within the United States and, by State of residence and nationality, on the proportion of refugees receiving cash or medical assistance described in subsection (e). In allocating resources, the Director shall avoid duplication of services and provide for maximum coordination between agencies providing related services.
<br>
<br>(4)(A) No grant or contract may be awarded under this section unless an appropriate proposal and application (including a description of the agency's ability to perform the services specified in the proposal) are submitted to, and approved by, the appropriate administering official. Grants and contracts under this section shall be made to those agencies which the appropriate administering official determines can best perform the services. Payments may be made for activities authorized under this subchapter in advance or by way of reimbursement. In carrying out this section, the Director, the Secretary of State, and any such other appropriate administering official are authorized—
<br>
<br>(i) to make loans, and
<br>
<br>(ii) to accept and use money, funds, property, and services of any kind made available by gift, devise, bequest, grant, or otherwise for the purpose of carrying out this section.
<br>
<br>(B) No funds may be made available under this subchapter (other than under subsection (b)(1)) to States or political subdivisions in the form of block grants, per capita grants, or similar consolidated grants or contracts. Such funds shall be made available under separate grants or contracts—
<br>
<br>(i) for medical screening and initial medical treatment under subsection (b)(5),
<br>
<br>(ii) for services for refugees under subsection (c)(1),
<br>
<br>(iii) for targeted assistance project grants under subsection (c)(2), and
<br>
<br>(iv) for assistance for refugee children under subsection (d)(2).
<br>
<br>(C) The Director may not delegate to a State or political subdivision his authority to review or approve grants or contracts under this subchapter or the terms under which such grants or contracts are made.
<br>
<br>(5) Assistance and services funded under this section shall be provided to refugees without regard to race, religion, nationality, sex, or political opinion.
<br>
<br>(6) As a condition for receiving assistance under this section, a State must—
<br>
<br>(A) submit to the Director a plan which provides—
<br>
<br>(i) a description of how the State intends to encourage effective refugee resettlement and to promote economic self-sufficiency as quickly as possible,
<br>
<br>(ii) a description of how the State will insure that language training and employment services are made available to refugees receiving cash assistance,
<br>
<br>(iii) for the designation of an individual, employed by the State, who will be responsible for insuring coordination of public and private resources in refugee resettlement,
<br>
<br>(iv) for the care and supervision of and legal responsibility for unaccompanied refugee children in the State, and

<br>
<br>(B) meet standards, goals, and priorities, developed by the Director, which assure the effective resettlement of refugees and which promote their economic self-sufficiency as quickly as possible and the efficient provision of services; and

<br>
<br>(7) The Secretary, together with the Secretary of State with respect to assistance provided by the Secretary of State under subsection (b), shall develop a system of monitoring the assistance provided under this section. This system shall include—
<br>
<br>(A) evaluations of the effectiveness of the programs funded under this section and the performance of States, grantees, and contractors;

<br>(C) data collection on the services provided and the results achieved.

<br>
<br>to make grants to, and contracts with, public or private nonprofit agencies for initial resettlement (including initial reception and placement with sponsors) of refugees in the United States. Grants to, or contracts with, private nonprofit voluntary agencies under this paragraph shall be made consistent with the objectives of this subchapter, taking into account the different resettlement approaches and practices of such agencies. Resettlement assistance under this paragraph shall be provided in coordination with the Director's provision of other assistance under this subchapter. Funds provided to agencies under such grants and contracts may only be obligated or expended during the fiscal year in which they are provided (or the subsequent fiscal year or such subsequent fiscal period as the Federal contracting agency may approve) to carry out the purposes of this subsection.
<br>
<br>(B) If the President determines that the Director should not administer the program under this paragraph, the authority of the Director under the first sentence of subparagraph (A) shall be exercised by such officer as the President shall from time to time specify.

<br>

<br>
<br>(4) The Secretary shall—

<br>
<br>(2)(A) The Director is authorized to make grants to States for assistance to counties and similar areas in the States where, because of factors such as unusually large refugee populations (including secondary migration), high refugee concentrations, and high use of public assistance by refugees, there exists and can be demonstrated a specific need for supplementation of available resources for services to refugees.
<br>
<br>(B) Grants shall be made available under this paragraph—

<br>(2)(A) The Director is authorized to provide assistance, reimbursement to States, and grants to and contracts with public and private nonprofit agencies, for the provision of child welfare services, including foster care maintenance payments and services and health care, furnished to any refugee child (except as provided in subparagraph (B)) during the thirty-six month period beginning with the first month in which such refugee child is in the United States.
<br>
<br>(B)(i) In the case of a refugee child who is unaccompanied by a parent or other close adult relative (as defined by the Director), the services described in subparagraph (A) may be furnished until the month after the child attains eighteen years of age (or such higher age as the State's child welfare services plan under part B of title IV of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 620 et seq.] prescribes for the availability of such services to any other child in that State).
<br>
<br>(ii) The Director shall attempt to arrange for the placement under the laws of the States of such unaccompanied refugee children, who have been accepted for admission to the United States, before (or as soon as possible after) their arrival in the United States. During any interim period while such a child is in the United States or in transit to the United States but before the child is so placed, the Director shall assume legal responsibility (including financial responsibility) for the child, if necessary, and is authorized to make necessary decisions to provide for the child's immediate care.
<br>
<br>(iii) In carrying out the Director's responsibilities under clause (ii), the Director is authorized to enter into contracts with appropriate public or private nonprofit agencies under such conditions as the Director determines to be appropriate.

<br>
<br>(1) The Director is authorized to provide assistance, reimbursement to States, and grants to, and contracts with, public or private nonprofit agencies for 100 per centum of the cash assistance and medical assistance provided to any refugee during the thirty-six month period beginning with the first month in which such refugee has entered the United States and for the identifiable and reasonable administrative costs of providing this assistance.
<br>
<br>(2)(A) Cash assistance provided under this subsection to an employable refugee is conditioned, except for good cause shown—
<br>
<br>(i) on the refugee's registration with an appropriate agency providing employment services described in subsection (c)(1)(A)(i), or, if there is no such agency available, with an appropriate State or local employment service;
<br>
<br>(ii) on the refugee's participation in any available and appropriate social service or targeted assistance program (funded under subsection (c)) providing job or language training in the area in which the refugee resides; and
<br>
<br>(iii) on the refugee's acceptance of appropriate offers of employment.
<br>
<br>(B) Cash assistance shall not be made available to refugees who are full-time students in institutions of higher education (as defined by the Director after consultation with the Secretary of Education).
<br>
<br>(C) In the case of a refugee who—
<br>
<br>(i) refuses an offer of employment which has been determined to be appropriate either by the agency responsible for the initial resettlement of the refugee under subsection (b) or by the appropriate State or local employment service,
<br>
<br>(ii) refuses to go to a job interview which has been arranged through such agency or service, or
<br>
<br>(iii) refuses to participate in a social service or targeted assistance program referred to in subparagraph (A)(ii) which such agency or service determines to be available and appropriate,
<br>
<br>cash assistance to the refugee shall be terminated (after opportunity for an administrative hearing) for a period of three months (for the first such refusal) or for a period of six months (for any subsequent refusal).
<br>
<br>(3) The Director shall develop plans to provide English training and other appropriate services and training to refugees receiving cash assistance.
<br>
<br>(4) If a refugee is eligible for aid or assistance under a State program funded under part A of title IV or under title XIX of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 601 et seq., 1396 et seq.], or for supplemental security income benefits (including State supplementary payments) under the program established under title XVI of that Act [42 U.S.C. 1381 et seq.], funds authorized under this subsection shall only be used for the non-Federal share of such aid or assistance, or for such supplementary payments, with respect to cash and medical assistance provided with respect to such refugee under this paragraph.
<br>
<br>(5) The Director is authorized to allow for the provision of medical assistance under paragraph (1) to any refugee, during the one-year period after entry, who does not qualify for assistance under a State plan approved under title XIX of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.] on account of any resources or income requirement of such plan, but only if the Director determines that—
<br>
<br>(A) this will (i) encourage economic self-sufficiency, or (ii) avoid a significant burden on State and local governments; and
<br>
<br>(B) the refugee meets such alternative financial resources and income requirements as the Director shall establish.
<br>
<br>(6) As a condition for receiving assistance, reimbursement, or a contract under this subsection and notwithstanding any other provision of law, a State or agency must provide assurances that whenever a refugee applies for cash or medical assistance for which assistance or reimbursement is provided under this subsection, the State or agency must notify promptly the agency (or local affiliate) which provided for the initial resettlement of the refugee under subsection (b) of the fact that the refugee has so applied.
<br>
<br>(7)(A) The Secretary shall develop and implement alternative projects for refugees who have been in the United States less than thirty-six months, under which refugees are provided interim support, medical services, support services, and case management, as needed, in a manner that encourages self-sufficiency, reduces welfare dependency, and fosters greater coordination among the resettlement agencies and service providers. The Secretary may permit alternative projects to cover specific groups of refugees who have been in the United States 36 months or longer if the Secretary determines that refugees in the group have been significantly and disproportionately dependent on welfare and need the services provided under the project in order to become self-sufficient and that their coverage under the projects would be cost-effective.
<br>
<br>(B) Refugees covered under such alternative projects shall be precluded from receiving cash or medical assistance under any other paragraph of this subsection or under title XIX or part A of title IV of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq., 601 et seq.].
<br>
<br>(C) The Secretary shall report to Congress not later than October 31, 1985, on the results of these projects and on any recommendations respecting changes in the refugee assistance program under this section to take into account such results.
<br>
<br>(D) To the extent that the use of such funds is consistent with the purposes of such provisions, funds appropriated under section 1524(a) of this title, part A of title IV of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.], or title XIX of such Act [42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.], may be used for the purpose of implementing and evaluating alternative projects under this paragraph.
<br>
<br>(8) In its provision of assistance to refugees, a State or political subdivision shall consider the recommendations of, and assistance provided by, agencies with grants or contracts under subsection (b)(1).
<br>(f) Assistance to States and counties for incarceration of certain Cuban nationals; priority for removal and return to Cuba
<br>
<br>(1) The Attorney General shall pay compensation to States and to counties for costs incurred by the States and counties to confine in prisons, during the fiscal year for which such payment is made, nationals of Cuba who—
<br>
<br>(A) were paroled into the United States in 1980 by the Attorney General,
<br>
<br>(B) after such parole committed any violation of State or county law for which a term of imprisonment was imposed, and
<br>
<br>(C) at the time of such parole and such violation were not aliens lawfully admitted to the United States—
<br>
<br>(i) for permanent residence, or
<br>
<br>(ii) under the terms of an immigrant or a nonimmigrant visa issued,
<br>
<br>under this chapter.
<br>
<br>(2) For a State or county to be eligible to receive compensation under this subsection, the chief executive officer of the State or county shall submit to the Attorney General, in accordance with rules to be issued by the Attorney General, an application containing—
<br>
<br>(A) the number and names of the Cuban nationals with respect to whom the State or county is entitled to such compensation, and
<br>
<br>(B) such other information as the Attorney General may require.
<br>
<br>(3) For a fiscal year the Attorney General shall pay the costs described in paragraph (1) to each State and county determined by the Attorney General to be eligible under paragraph (2); except that if the amounts appropriated for the fiscal year to carry out this subsection are insufficient to cover all such payments, each of such payments shall be ratably reduced so that the total of such payments equals the amounts so appropriated.
<br>
<br>(4) The authority of the Attorney General to pay compensation under this subsection shall be effective for any fiscal year only to the extent and in such amounts as may be provided in advance in appropriation Acts.
<br>
<br>(5) It shall be the policy of the United States Government that the President, in consultation with the Attorney General and all other appropriate Federal officials and all appropriate State and county officials referred to in paragraph (2), shall place top priority on seeking the expeditious removal from this country and the return to Cuba of Cuban nationals described in paragraph (1) by any reasonable and responsible means, and to this end the Attorney General may use the funds authorized to carry out this subsection to conduct such policy.

Until the Secretary is so satisfied, no further payments shall be made to the State educational agency under such title, or payments by the State educational agency under such title shall be limited to local educational agencies or other entities (in the case of funds under title IV) whose actions did not cause or were not involved in the failure, as the case may be.

<br>"state entitlements
<br>
<br>"Sec. 201. (a) The Secretary shall, in accordance with the provisions of this title, make grants to State educational agencies for fiscal year 1981, and for each subsequent fiscal year, for the purposes of assisting local educational agencies of that State in providing basic education for eligible participants enrolled in elementary or secondary public schools. Payments made under this title to any State shall be used in accordance with applications approved under section 202 for public educational services for eligible participants enrolled in the elementary and secondary public schools under the jurisdiction of the local educational agencies of that State.
<br>
<br>"(b)(1) As soon as possible after the date of the enactment of the Consolidated Refugee Education Assistance Act [Aug. 13, 1981], the Secretary shall establish a formula (reflecting the availability of the full amount authorized for this title under section 203(b)) by which to determine the amount of the grant which each State educational agency is entitled to receive under this title for any fiscal year. The formula established by the Secretary shall take into account the number of years that an eligible participant assisted under this title has resided within the United States and the relative costs, by grade level, of providing education for elementary and secondary school children. On the basis of the formula the Secretary shall allocate among the State educational agencies, for each fiscal year, the amounts available to carry out this title, subject to such reductions or adjustments as may be required under paragraph (2) or subsection (c). Funds shall be allocated among State educational agencies pursuant to the formula without regard to variations in educational costs among different geographical areas.
<br>
<br>"(2) The amount of the grant to which a State educational agency is otherwise entitled for any fiscal year, as determined under paragraph (1), shall be reduced by the amounts made available for such fiscal year under any other Federal law for expenditure within the State for the same purposes as those for which funds are made available under this title, except that the reduction shall be made only to the extent that (A) such amounts are made available for such purposes specifically because of the refugee, parolee, or asylee status of the individuals to be served by such funds, and (B) such amounts are made available to provide assistance to individuals eligible for services under this title. The amount of the reduction required under this paragraph shall be determined by the Secretary in a manner consistent with subsection (c).
<br>
<br>"(3) For the purpose of this subsection, the term 'State' does not include Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. The entitlements of such jurisdictions shall be determined in the manner specified in section 103, but for purposes of this title and section 105 any payments made under section 103 for the purposes set forth in section 201(a) shall be considered to be payments under this title.
<br>
<br>"(c) Determinations by the Secretary under this title for any period with respect to the number of eligible participants and the amount of the reduction under subsection (b)(2) shall be made, whenever actual satisfactory data are not available, on the basis of estimates. No such determination shall operate because of an underestimate or overestimate to deprive any State educational agency of its entitlement to any payment (or the amount thereof) under this title to which such agency would be entitled had such determination been made on the basis of accurate data.
<br>"applications
<br>
<br>"Sec. 202. (a) No State educational agency shall be entitled to any payment under this title for any period unless that agency submits an application to the Secretary at such time, in such manner, and containing or accompanied by such information, as the Secretary may reasonably require. Each such application shall—

<br>
<br>"(2) provide assurances that such payments will be distributed among local educational agencies within that State in accordance with the formula established by the Secretary under section 201, subject to any reductions in payments for those local educational agencies identified under paragraph (3) to which funds described by section 201(b)(2) are made available for the same purposes under other Federal laws;
<br>
<br>"(3) specify the amount of funds described by section 201(b)(2) which are made available under other Federal laws for expenditure within the State for the same purposes as those for which funds are made available under this title and the local educational agencies to which such funds are made available;

<br>"(4) provide assurances that the State educational agency will not finally disapprove in whole or in part any application for funds received under this title without first affording the local educational agency submitting the application for such funds reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing; and
<br>
<br>"(5) provide for making such reports as the Secretary may reasonably require to carry out this title.
<br>
<br>"(b) The Secretary shall approve an application which meets the requirements of subsection (a). The Secretary shall not finally disapprove an application of a State educational agency except after reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing on the record to such agency.
<br>"payments and authorizations

<br>
<br>"(B) the amount equal to the product of (i) the number of eligible participants enrolled during the period for which the determination is made in elementary or secondary public schools under the jurisdiction of each local educational agency described under paragraph (2) within that State, or in any elementary or secondary nonpublic school within the district served by each such local educational agency, who have been eligible participants at least one year but not more than two years, multiplied by (ii) $500; and
<br>
<br>"(C) the product of (i) the number of eligible participants enrolled during the period for which the determination is made in elementary or secondary public schools under the jurisdiction of each local educational agency described under paragraph (2) within that State, or in any elementary or secondary nonpublic school within the district served by each such local educational agency, who have been eligible participants more than two years but not more than three years, multiplied by (ii) $300.
<br>
<br>"(2) The local educational agencies referred to in paragraph (1) are those local educational agencies in which the sum of the number of eligible participants who are enrolled in elementary or secondary public schools under the jurisdiction of such agencies, or in elementary or secondary nonpublic schools within the districts served by such agencies, during the fiscal year for which the payments are to be made under this title, and are receiving supplementary educational services during such period, is equal to—
<br>
<br>"(A) at least 500; or
<br>
<br>"(B) at least 5 percent of the total number of students enrolled in such public or nonpublic schools during such fiscal year;
<br>
<br>whichever number is less. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, the local educational agencies referred to in paragraph (1) shall include local educational agencies eligible to receive assistance by reason of the last sentence of section 3(b) and section 3(c)(2)(B) of the Act of September 30, 1950 (Public Law 874, Eighty-first Congress) [formerly 20 U.S.C. 238(b) and (c)(2)(B)], relating to Federal impact aid, subject to paragraph (5) of this subsection.
<br>
<br>"(3) The amount of the grant to which a State educational agency is otherwise entitled for any fiscal year, as determined under paragraph (1), shall be reduced by the amounts made available under any other Federal law to agencies or other entities for educational, or education-related, services or activities within the State because of the significant concentration of eligible participants. The amount of the reduction required under this paragraph shall be determined by the Secretary in a manner consistent with subsection (c).
<br>
<br>"(4) For the purpose of this subsection, the term 'State' does not include Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. The entitlements of such jurisdictions shall be determined in the manner specified in section 103, but for purposes of this title and section 105 any payments made under section 103 for the purposes set forth in section 302 shall be considered to be payments under this title.
<br>
<br>"(5) The amount of the grant to which a State educational agency is entitled as a result of the last sentence of paragraph (2) shall be limited to eligible participants who meet the requirements of section 101(4).
<br>
<br>"(c) Determinations by the Secretary under this title for any period with respect to the number of eligible participants and the amount of the reduction under subsection (b)(3) shall be made, whenever actual satisfactory data are not available, on the basis of estimates. No such determination shall operate because of an underestimate or overestimate to deprive any State educational agency of its entitlement to any payment (or the amount thereof) under this title to which such agency would be entitled had such determination been made on the basis of accurate data.
<br>
<br>"(d) Whenever the Secretary determines that any amount of a payment made to a State under this title for a fiscal year will not be used by such State for carrying out the purpose for which the payment was made, the Secretary shall make such amount available for carrying out such purpose to one or more other States to the extent the Secretary determines that such other States will be able to use such additional amount for carrying out such purpose. Any amount made available to a State from an appropriation for a fiscal year in accordance with the preceding sentence shall, for purposes of this title, be regarded as part of such State's payment (as determined under subsection (b)) for such year, but shall remain available until the end of the succeeding fiscal year.
