<br>All officers and directors, and those employees and paid consultants of eligible institutions, eligible lenders, guaranty agencies, loan servicing agencies, accrediting agencies or associations, State licensing agencies or boards, and entities acting as secondary markets (including the Student Loan Marketing Association), who are engaged in making decisions as to the administration of any program or funds under this subchapter or as to the eligibility of any entity or individual to participate under this subchapter, shall report to the Secretary, in such manner and at such time as the Secretary shall require, on any financial interest which such individual may hold in any other entity participating in any program assisted under this subchapter.

<br>§1085. Definitions for student loan insurance program
<br>
<br>As used in this part:
<br>(a) Eligible institution
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Except as provided in paragraph (2), the term "eligible institution" means an institution of higher education, as defined in section 1002 of this title, except that, for the purposes of sections 1077(a)(2)(C)(i) and 1078(b)(1)(M)(i) of this title, an eligible institution includes any institution that is within this definition without regard to whether such institution is participating in any program under this subchapter and includes any institution ineligible for participation in any program under this part pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection.
<br>(2) Ineligibility based on high default rates
<br>
<br>(A) An institution whose cohort default rate is equal to or greater than the threshold percentage specified in subparagraph (B) for each of the three most recent fiscal years for which data are available shall not be eligible to participate in a program under this part for the fiscal year for which the determination is made and for the two succeeding fiscal years, unless, within 30 days of receiving notification from the Secretary of the loss of eligibility under this paragraph, the institution appeals the loss of its eligibility to the Secretary. The Secretary shall issue a decision on any such appeal within 45 days after its submission. Such decision may permit the institution to continue to participate in a program under this part if—
<br>
<br>(i) the institution demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the Secretary's calculation of its cohort default rate is not accurate, and that recalculation would reduce its cohort default rate for any of the three fiscal years below the threshold percentage specified in subparagraph (B);
<br>
<br>(ii) there are exceptional mitigating circumstances within the meaning of paragraph (5); or
<br>
<br>(iii) there are, in the judgment of the Secretary, other exceptional mitigating circumstances that would make the application of this paragraph inequitable.
<br>
<br>During such appeal, the Secretary may permit the institution to continue to participate in a program under this part. If an institution continues to participate in a program under this part, and the institution's appeal of the loss of eligibility is unsuccessful, the institution shall be required to pay to the Secretary an amount equal to the amount of interest, special allowance, reinsurance, and any related payments made by the Secretary (or which the Secretary is obligated to make) with respect to loans made under this part to students attending, or planning to attend, that institution during the pendency of such appeal.
<br>
<br>(B) For purposes of determinations under subparagraph (A), the threshold percentage is—
<br>
<br>(i) 35 percent for fiscal year 1991 and 1992;
<br>
<br>(ii) 30 percent for fiscal year 1993;
<br>
<br>(iii) 25 percent for fiscal year 1994 through fiscal year 2011; and
<br>
<br>(iv) 30 percent for fiscal year 2012 and any succeeding fiscal year.
<br>
<br>(C) Until July 1, 1999, this paragraph shall not apply to any institution that is—
<br>
<br>(i) a part B institution within the meaning of section 1061(2) of this title;
<br>
<br>(ii) a tribally controlled college or university, as defined in section 1801(a)(4) of title 25; or
<br>
<br>(iii) a Navajo Community College under the Navajo Community College Act.
<br>
<br>(D) Notwithstanding the first sentence of subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall restore the eligibility to participate in a program under subpart 1 of part A, part B, or part E of an institution that did not appeal its loss of eligibility within 30 days of receiving notification if the Secretary determines, on a case-by-case basis, that the institution's failure to appeal was substantially justified under the circumstances, and that—
<br>
<br>(i) the institution made a timely request that the appropriate guaranty agency correct errors in the draft data used to calculate the institution's cohort default rate;
<br>
<br>(ii) the guaranty agency did not correct the erroneous data in a timely fashion; and
<br>
<br>(iii) the institution would have been eligible if the erroneous data had been corrected by the guaranty agency.
<br>(3) Appeals for regulatory relief
<br>
<br>An institution whose cohort default rate, calculated in accordance with subsection (m), is equal to or greater than the threshold percentage specified in paragraph (2)(B)(iv) for any two consecutive fiscal years may, not later than 30 days after the date the institution receives notification from the Secretary, file an appeal demonstrating exceptional mitigating circumstances, as defined in paragraph (5). The Secretary shall issue a decision on any such appeal not later than 45 days after the date of submission of the appeal. If the Secretary determines that the institution demonstrates exceptional mitigating circumstances, the Secretary may not subject the institution to provisional certification based solely on the institution's cohort default rate.
<br>(4) Appeals based upon allegations of improper loan servicing
<br>
<br>An institution that—
<br>
<br>(A) is subject to loss of eligibility for the Federal Family Education Loan Program pursuant to paragraph (2)(A) of this subsection;
<br>
<br>(B) is subject to loss of eligibility for the Federal Supplemental Loans for Students pursuant to section 1078–1(a)(2) 1 of this title; or
<br>
<br>(C) is an institution whose cohort default rate equals or exceeds 20 percent for the most recent year for which data are available;
<br>
<br>may include in its appeal of such loss or rate a defense based on improper loan servicing (in addition to other defenses). In any such appeal, the Secretary shall take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that such institution has access for a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 30 days, to a representative sample (as determined by the Secretary) of the relevant loan servicing and collection records used by a guaranty agency in determining whether to pay a claim on a defaulted loan or by the Department in determining an institution's default rate in the loan program under part D of this subchapter. The Secretary shall reduce the institution's cohort default rate to reflect the percentage of defaulted loans in the representative sample that are required to be excluded pursuant to subsection (m)(1)(B).
<br>(5) Definition of mitigating circumstances
<br>
<br>(A) For purposes of this subsection, an institution of higher education shall be treated as having exceptional mitigating circumstances that make application of paragraph (2) inequitable, and that provide for regulatory relief under paragraph (3), if such institution, in the opinion of an independent auditor, meets the following criteria:
<br>
<br>(i) For a 12-month period that ended during the 6 months immediately preceding the fiscal year for which the cohort of borrowers used to calculate the institution's cohort default rate is determined, at least two-thirds of the students enrolled on at least a half-time basis at the institution—
<br>
<br>(I) are eligible to receive a Federal Pell Grant award that is at least equal to one-half the Federal Pell Grant amount, determined under section 1070a(b)(2)(A) of this title, for which a student would be eligible based on the student's enrollment status; or
<br>
<br>(II) have an adjusted gross income that when added with the adjusted gross income of the student's parents (unless the student is an independent student), of less than the poverty level, as determined by the Department of Health and Human Services.
<br>
<br>(ii) In the case of an institution of higher education that offers an associate, baccalaureate, graduate or professional degree, 70 percent or more of the institution's regular students who were initially enrolled on a full-time basis and were scheduled to complete their programs during the same 12-month period described in clause (i)—
<br>
<br>(I) completed the educational programs in which the students were enrolled;
<br>
<br>(II) transferred from the institution to a higher level educational program;
<br>
<br>(III) at the end of the 12-month period, remained enrolled and making satisfactory progress toward completion of the student's educational programs; or
<br>
<br>(IV) entered active duty in the Armed Forces of the United States.
<br>
<br>(iii)(I) In the case of an institution of higher education that does not award a degree described in clause (ii), had a placement rate of 44 percent or more with respect to the institution's former regular students who—
<br>
<br>(aa) remained in the program beyond the point the students would have received a 100 percent tuition refund from the institution;
<br>
<br>(bb) were initially enrolled on at least a half-time basis; and
<br>
<br>(cc) were originally scheduled, at the time of enrollment, to complete their educational programs during the same 12-month period described in clause (i).
<br>
<br>(II) The placement rate shall not include students who are still enrolled and making satisfactory progress in the educational programs in which the students were originally enrolled on the date following 12 months after the date of the student's last date of attendance at the institution.
<br>
<br>(III) The placement rate is calculated by determining the percentage of all those former regular students who—
<br>
<br>(aa) are employed, in an occupation for which the institution provided training, on the date following 12 months after the date of their last day of attendance at the institution;
<br>
<br>(bb) were employed, in an occupation for which the institution provided training, for at least 13 weeks before the date following 12 months after the date of their last day of attendance at the institution; or
<br>
<br>(cc) entered active duty in the Armed Forces of the United States.
<br>
<br>(IV) The placement rate shall not include as placements a student or former student for whom the institution is the employer.
<br>
<br>(B) For purposes of determining a rate of completion and a placement rate under this paragraph, a student is originally scheduled, at the time of enrollment, to complete the educational program on the date when the student will have been enrolled in the program for the amount of time normally required to complete the program. The amount of time normally required to complete the program for a student who is initially enrolled full-time is the period of time specified in the institution's enrollment contract, catalog, or other materials, for completion of the program by a full-time student. For a student who is initially enrolled less than full-time, the period is the amount of time it would take the student to complete the program if the student remained enrolled at that level of enrollment throughout the program.
<br>(6) Reduction of default rates at certain minority institutions
<br>(A) Beneficiaries of exception required to establish management plan
<br>
<br>After July 1, 1999, any institution that has a cohort default rate that equals or exceeds 25 percent for each of the three most recent fiscal years for which data are available and that relies on the exception in subparagraph (B) to continue to be an eligible institution shall—
<br>
<br>(i) submit to the Secretary a default management plan which the Secretary, in the Secretary's discretion, after consideration of the institution's history, resources, dollars in default, and targets for default reduction, determines is acceptable and provides reasonable assurance that the institution will, by July 1, 2004, have a cohort default rate that is less than 25 percent;
<br>
<br>(ii) engage an independent third party (which may be paid with funds received under section 1059d of this title or part B of subchapter III) to provide technical assistance in implementing such default management plan; and
<br>
<br>(iii) provide to the Secretary, on an annual basis or at such other intervals as the Secretary may require, evidence of cohort default rate improvement and successful implementation of such default management plan.
<br>(B) Discretionary eligibility conditioned on improvement
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding the expiration of the exception in paragraph (2)(C), the Secretary may, in the Secretary's discretion, continue to treat an institution described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph as an eligible institution for each of the 1-year periods beginning on July 1 of 1999 through 2003, only if the institution submits by the beginning of such period evidence satisfactory to the Secretary that—
<br>
<br>(i) such institution has complied and is continuing to comply with the requirements of subparagraph (A); and
<br>
<br>(ii) such institution has made substantial improvement, during each of the preceding 1-year periods, in the institution's cohort default rate.
<br>(7) Default prevention and assessment of eligibility based on high default rates
<br>(A) First year
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>An institution whose cohort default rate is equal to or greater than the threshold percentage specified in paragraph (2)(B)(iv) in any fiscal year shall establish a default prevention task force to prepare a plan to—
<br>
<br>(I) identify the factors causing the institution's cohort default rate to exceed such threshold;
<br>
<br>(II) establish measurable objectives and the steps to be taken to improve the institution's cohort default rate; and
<br>
<br>(III) specify actions that the institution can take to improve student loan repayment, including appropriate counseling regarding loan repayment options.
<br>(ii) Technical assistance
<br>
<br>Each institution subject to this subparagraph shall submit the plan under clause (i) to the Secretary, who shall review the plan and offer technical assistance to the institution to promote improved student loan repayment.
<br>(B) Second consecutive year
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>An institution whose cohort default rate is equal to or greater than the threshold percentage specified in paragraph (2)(B)(iv) for two consecutive fiscal years, shall require the institution's default prevention task force established under subparagraph (A) to review and revise the plan required under such subparagraph, and shall submit such revised plan to the Secretary.
<br>(ii) Review by the Secretary
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall review each revised plan submitted in accordance with this subparagraph, and may direct that such plan be amended to include actions, with measurable objectives, that the Secretary determines, based on available data and analyses of student loan defaults, will promote student loan repayment.
<br>(8) Participation rate index
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>An institution that demonstrates to the Secretary that the institution's participation rate index is equal to or less than 0.0625 for any of the 3 most recent fiscal years for which data is available shall not be subject to paragraph (2). The participation rate index shall be determined by multiplying the institution's cohort default rate for loans under this part or part D, or weighted average cohort default rate for loans under this part and part D, by the percentage of the institution's regular students, enrolled on at least a half-time basis, who received a loan made under this part or part D for a 12-month period ending during the 6 months immediately preceding the fiscal year for which the cohort of borrowers used to calculate the institution's cohort default rate is determined.
<br>(B) Data
<br>
<br>An institution shall provide the Secretary with sufficient data to determine the institution's participation rate index within 30 days after receiving an initial notification of the institution's draft cohort default rate.
<br>(C) Notification
<br>
<br>Prior to publication of a final cohort default rate for an institution that provides the data described in subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall notify the institution of the institution's compliance or noncompliance with subparagraph (A).

<br>(l) Default
<br>
<br>Except as provided in subsection (m), the term "default" includes only such defaults as have existed for (1) 270 days in the case of a loan which is repayable in monthly installments, or (2) 330 days in the case of a loan which is repayable in less frequent installments.
<br>(m) Cohort default rate
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>(A) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the term "cohort default rate" means, for any fiscal year in which 30 or more current and former students at the institution enter repayment on loans under section 1078, 1078–1,1 or 1078–8 of this title received for attendance at the institution, the percentage of those current and former students who enter repayment on such loans (or on the portion of a loan made under section 1078–3 of this title that is used to repay any such loans) received for attendance at that institution in that fiscal year who default before the end of the second fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the students entered repayment. The Secretary shall require that each guaranty agency that has insured loans for current or former students of the institution afford such institution a reasonable opportunity (as specified by the Secretary) to review and correct errors in the information required to be provided to the Secretary by the guaranty agency for the purposes of calculating a cohort default rate for such institution, prior to the calculation of such rate.
<br>
<br>(B) In determining the number of students who default before the end of such second fiscal year, the Secretary shall include only loans for which the Secretary or a guaranty agency has paid claims for insurance. In considering appeals with respect to cohort default rates pursuant to subsection (a)(3), the Secretary shall exclude, from the calculation of the number of students who entered repayment and from the calculation of the number of students who default, any loans which, due to improper servicing or collection, would, as demonstrated by the evidence submitted in support of the institution's timely appeal to the Secretary, result in an inaccurate or incomplete calculation of such cohort default rate.
<br>
<br>(C) For any fiscal year in which fewer than 30 of the institution's current and former students enter repayment, the term "cohort default rate" means the percentage of such current and former students who entered repayment on such loans (or on the portion of a loan made under section 1078–3 of this title that is used to repay any such loans) in any of the three most recent fiscal years, who default before the end of the second fiscal year following the year in which they entered repayment.
<br>(2) Special rules
<br>
<br>(A) In the case of a student who has attended and borrowed at more than one school, the student (and such student's subsequent repayment or default) is attributed to each school for attendance at which the student received a loan that entered repayment in the fiscal year.
<br>
<br>(B) A loan on which a payment is made by the school, such school's owner, agent, contractor, employee, or any other entity or individual affiliated with such school, in order to avoid default by the borrower, is considered as in default for purposes of this subsection.
