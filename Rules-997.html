<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, an institution may not condition the packaging or receipt of Federal financial aid on the completion of additional requests for financial information beyond the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, unless such information is required for verification, a determination of independence, or professional judgement.

(referred to individually in this chapter as an "apprenticeship", except in section 171); 1
<br>

<br>
<br>Each eligible institution may certify student eligibility for a loan by an eligible lender under part B of this subchapter prior to completing the review for accuracy of the information submitted by the applicant required by regulations issued under this subchapter, if—
<br>
<br>(1) checks for the loans are mailed to the eligible institution prior to disbursements;
<br>
<br>(2) the disbursement is not made until the review is complete; and
<br>
<br>(3) the eligible institution has no evidence or documentation on which the institution may base a determination that the information submitted by the applicant is incorrect.
<br>(f) Loss of eligibility for violation of loan limits
<br>
<br>(1) No student shall be eligible to receive any grant, loan, or work assistance under this subchapter if the eligible institution determines that the student fraudulently borrowed in violation of the annual loan limits under part B, part D, or part E of this subchapter in the same academic year, or if the student fraudulently borrowed in excess of the aggregate maximum loan limits under such part B, part D, or part E.
<br>
<br>(2) If the institution determines that the student inadvertently borrowed amounts in excess of such annual or aggregate maximum loan limits, such institution shall allow the student to repay any amount borrowed in excess of such limits prior to certifying the student's eligibility for further assistance under this subchapter.
<br>(g) Verification of immigration status
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall implement a system under which the statements and supporting documentation, if required, of an individual declaring that such individual is in compliance with the requirements of subsection (a)(5) shall be verified prior to the individual's receipt of a grant, loan, or work assistance under this subchapter.
<br>(2) Special rule
<br>
<br>The documents collected and maintained by an eligible institution in the admission of a student to the institution may be used by the student in lieu of the documents used to establish both employment authorization and identity under section 1324a(b)(1)(B) of title 8 to verify eligibility to participate in work-study programs under part C of this subchapter.
<br>(3) Verification mechanisms
<br>
<br>The Secretary is authorized to verify such statements and supporting documentation through a data match, using an automated or other system, with other Federal agencies that may be in possession of information relevant to such statements and supporting documentation.
<br>(4) Review
<br>
<br>In the case of such an individual who is not a citizen or national of the United States, if the statement described in paragraph (1) is submitted but the documentation required under paragraph (2) is not presented or if the documentation required under paragraph (2)(A) is presented but such documentation is not verified under paragraph (3)—
<br>
<br>(A) the institution—
<br>
<br>(i) shall provide a reasonable opportunity to submit to the institution evidence indicating a satisfactory immigration status, and
<br>
<br>(ii) may not delay, deny, reduce, or terminate the individual's eligibility for the grant, loan, or work assistance on the basis of the individual's immigration status until such a reasonable opportunity has been provided; and
<br>
<br>(B) if there are submitted documents which the institution determines constitute reasonable evidence indicating such status—
<br>
<br>(i) the institution shall transmit to the Immigration and Naturalization Service either photostatic or other similar copies of such documents, or information from such documents, as specified by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, for official verification,
<br>
<br>(ii) pending such verification, the institution may not delay, deny, reduce, or terminate the individual's eligibility for the grant, loan, or work assistance on the basis of the individual's immigration status, and
<br>
<br>(iii) the institution shall not be liable for the consequences of any action, delay, or failure of the Service to conduct such verification.

<br>
<br>The Secretary shall not take any compliance, disallowance, penalty, or other regulatory action against an institution of higher education with respect to any error in the institution's determination to make a student eligible for a grant, loan, or work assistance based on citizenship or immigration status—
<br>
<br>(1) if the institution has provided such eligibility based on a verification of satisfactory immigration status by the Immigration and Naturalization Service,
<br>
<br>(2) because the institution, under subsection (g)(4)(A)(i), was required to provide a reasonable opportunity to submit documentation, or
<br>
<br>(3) because the institution, under subsection (g)(4)(B)(i), was required to wait for the response of the Immigration and Naturalization Service to the institution's request for official verification of the immigration status of the student.
<br>(i) Validity of loan guarantees for loan payments made before immigration status verification completed
<br>

<br>(1) a guaranty is made under this subchapter for a loan made with respect to an individual,
<br>

<br>
<br>(3) amounts are paid under the loan subject to such guaranty, and
<br>
<br>(4) there is a subsequent determination that, because of an unsatisfactory immigration status, the individual is not eligible for the loan,
<br>
<br>the official of the institution making the determination shall notify and instruct the entity making the loan to cease further payments under the loan, but such guaranty shall not be voided or otherwise nullified with respect to such payments made before the date the entity receives the notice.

<br>(n) Data base matching
<br>
<br>To enforce the Selective Service registration provisions of section 3811(f) of title 50, the Secretary shall conduct data base matches with the Selective Service, using common demographic data elements. Appropriate confirmation, through an application output document or through other means, of any person's registration shall fulfill the requirement to file a separate statement of compliance. In the absence of a confirmation from such data matches, an institution may also use data or documents that support either the student's registration, or the absence of a registration requirement for the student, to fulfill the requirement to file a separate statement of compliance. The mechanism for reporting the resolution of nonconfirmed matches shall be prescribed by the Secretary in regulations.
<br>(o) Study abroad
<br>
<br>Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to limit or otherwise prohibit access to study abroad programs approved by the home institution at which a student is enrolled.

<br>
<br>(2) If there is a determination by the Secretary that the social security number provided to an eligible institution by a student is incorrect, the institution shall deny or terminate the student's eligibility for any grant, loan, or work assistance under this subchapter until such time as the student provides documented evidence of a social security number that is determined by the institution to be correct.
<br>
<br>(3) If there is a determination by the Secretary that the social security number provided to an eligible institution by a student is incorrect, and a correct social security number cannot be provided by such student, and a loan has been guaranteed for such student under part B of this subchapter, the institution shall notify and instruct the lender and guaranty agency making and guaranteeing the loan, respectively, to cease further disbursements of the loan, but such guaranty shall not be voided or otherwise nullified with respect to such disbursements made before the date that the lender and the guaranty agency receives such notice.
<br>
<br>(4) Nothing in this subsection shall permit the Secretary to take any compliance, disallowance, penalty, or other regulatory action against—
