<br>§20917. Checking system for social networking websites
<br>(a) In general
<br>(1) Secure system for comparisons
<br>
<br>The Attorney General shall establish and maintain a secure system that permits social networking websites to compare the information contained in the National Sex Offender Registry with the Internet identifiers of users of the social networking websites, and view only those Internet identifiers that match. The system—
<br>
<br>(A) shall not require or permit any social networking website to transmit Internet identifiers of its users to the operator of the system, and
<br>
<br>(B) shall use secure procedures that preserve the secrecy of the information made available by the Attorney General, including protection measures that render the Internet identifiers and other data elements indecipherable.
<br>(2) Provision of information relating to identity
<br>
<br>Upon receiving a matched Internet identifier, the social networking website may make a request of the Attorney General for, and the Attorney General shall provide promptly, information related to the identity of the individual that has registered the matched Internet identifier. This information is limited to the name, sex, resident address, photograph, and physical description.
<br>(b) Qualification for use of system
<br>
<br>A social networking website seeking to use the system shall submit an application to the Attorney General which provides—
<br>
<br>(1) the name and legal status of the website;
<br>
<br>(2) the contact information for the website;
<br>
<br>(3) a description of the nature and operations of the website;
<br>
<br>(4) a statement explaining why the website seeks to use the system;
<br>
<br>(5) a description of policies and procedures to ensure that—
<br>
<br>(A) any individual who is denied access to that website on the basis of information obtained through the system is promptly notified of the basis for the denial and has the ability to challenge the denial of access; and
<br>
<br>(B) if the social networking website finds that information is inaccurate, incomplete, or cannot be verified, the site immediately notifies the appropriate State registry and the Department of Justice, so that they may delete or correct that information in the respective State and national databases;
<br>
<br>(6) the identity and address of, and contact information for, any contractor that will be used by the social networking website to use the system; and
<br>
<br>(7) such other information or attestations as the Attorney General may require to ensure that the website will use the system—
<br>
<br>(A) to protect the safety of the users of such website; and
<br>
<br>(B) for the limited purpose of making the automated comparison described in subsection (a).
<br>(c) Searches against the system
<br>(1) Frequency of use of the system
<br>
<br>A social networking website approved by the Attorney General to use the system may conduct searches under the system as frequently as the Attorney General may allow.
<br>(2) Authority of Attorney General to suspend use
<br>
<br>The Attorney General may deny, suspend, or terminate use of the system by a social networking website that—
<br>
<br>(A) provides false information in its application for use of the system;
<br>
<br>(B) may be using or seeks to use the system for any unlawful or improper purpose;
<br>
<br>(C) fails to comply with the procedures required under subsection (b)(5); or
<br>
<br>(D) uses information obtained from the system in any way that is inconsistent with the purposes of this Act.
<br>(3) Limitation on release of Internet identifiers
<br>(A) No public release
<br>
<br>Neither the Attorney General nor a social networking website approved to use the system may release to the public any list of the Internet identifiers of sex offenders contained in the system.
<br>(B) Additional limitations
<br>
<br>The Attorney General shall limit the release of information obtained through the use of the system established under subsection (a) by social networking websites approved to use such system.
<br>(C) Strict adherence to limitation
<br>
<br>The use of the system established under subsection (a) by a social networking website shall be conditioned on the website's agreement to observe the limitations required under this paragraph.
<br>(D) Rule of construction
<br>
<br>This subsection shall not be construed to limit the authority of the Attorney General under any other provision of law to conduct or to allow searches or checks against sex offender registration information.
<br>(4) Payment of fee
<br>
<br>A social networking website approved to use the system shall pay any fee established by the Attorney General for use of the system.
<br>(5) Limitation on liability
<br>(A) In general
<br>
<br>A civil claim against a social networking website, including any director, officer, employee, parent, contractor, or agent of that social networking website, arising from the use by such website of the National Sex Offender Registry, may not be brought in any Federal or State court.
<br>(B) Intentional, reckless, or other misconduct
<br>
<br>Subparagraph (A) does not apply to a claim if the social networking website, or a director, officer, employee, parent, contractor, or agent of that social networking website—
<br>
<br>(i) engaged in intentional misconduct; or
<br>
<br>(ii) acted, or failed to act—
<br>
<br>(I) with actual malice;
<br>
<br>(II) with reckless disregard to a substantial risk of causing injury without legal justification; or
<br>
<br>(III) for a purpose unrelated to the performance of any responsibility or function described in paragraph (3).
<br>(C) Minimizing access
<br>
<br>A social networking website shall minimize the number of employees that are provided access to the Internet identifiers for which a match has been found through the system.
<br>(6) Rule of construction
<br>
<br>Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any Internet website, including a social networking website, to use the system, and no Federal or State liability, or any other actionable adverse consequence, shall be imposed on such website based on its decision not to do so.

<br>§20927. Failure of jurisdiction to comply
<br>(a) In general
<br>
<br>For any fiscal year after the end of the period for implementation, a jurisdiction that fails, as determined by the Attorney General, to substantially implement this subchapter shall not receive 10 percent of the funds that would otherwise be allocated for that fiscal year to the jurisdiction under subpart 1 of part E of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3750 et seq.).1
<br>(b) State constitutionality
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>When evaluating whether a jurisdiction has substantially implemented this subchapter, the Attorney General shall consider whether the jurisdiction is unable to substantially implement this subchapter because of a demonstrated inability to implement certain provisions that would place the jurisdiction in violation of its constitution, as determined by a ruling of the jurisdiction's highest court.
<br>(2) Efforts
<br>
<br>If the circumstances arise under paragraph (1), then the Attorney General and the jurisdiction shall make good faith efforts to accomplish substantial implementation of this subchapter and to reconcile any conflicts between this subchapter and the jurisdiction's constitution. In considering whether compliance with the requirements of this subchapter would likely violate the jurisdiction's constitution or an interpretation thereof by the jurisdiction's highest court, the Attorney General shall consult with the chief executive and chief legal officer of the jurisdiction concerning the jurisdiction's interpretation of the jurisdiction's constitution and rulings thereon by the jurisdiction's highest court.
<br>(3) Alternative procedures
<br>
<br>If the jurisdiction is unable to substantially implement this subchapter because of a limitation imposed by the jurisdiction's constitution, the Attorney General may determine that the jurisdiction is in compliance with this chapter if the jurisdiction has made, or is in the process of implementing 2 reasonable alternative procedures or accommodations, which are consistent with the purposes of this chapter.
<br>(4) Funding reduction
<br>
<br>If a jurisdiction does not comply with paragraph (3), then the jurisdiction shall be subject to a funding reduction as specified in subsection (a).
<br>(c) Reallocation
<br>
<br>Amounts not allocated under a program referred to in this section to a jurisdiction for failure to substantially implement this subchapter shall be reallocated under that program to jurisdictions that have not failed to substantially implement this subchapter or may be reallocated to a jurisdiction from which they were withheld to be used solely for the purpose of implementing this subchapter.
<br>(d) Rule of construction
<br>
<br>The provisions of this subchapter that are cast as directions to jurisdictions or their officials constitute, in relation to States, only conditions required to avoid the reduction of Federal funding under this section.
