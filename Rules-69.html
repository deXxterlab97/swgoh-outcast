<br>2	Son of man, what shall be made of the wood of the vine, out of all the trees of the woods that are among the trees of the forests?
<br>3	Shall wood be taken of it, to do any work, or shall a pin be made of it for any vessel to hang thereon?
<br>4	Behold it is cast into the fire for fuel: the fire hath consumed both ends thereof, and the midst thereof is reduced to ashes: shall it be useful for any work?
<br>5	Even when it was whole it was not fit for work: how much less, when the fire hath de- voured and consumed it, shall any work be made of it?
<br>6	Therefore thus saith the Lord God: As the vine tree among the trees of the forests which I have given to the fire to be consumed, so will I deliver up the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
<br> 
<br>7	And I will set my face against them: they shall go out from fire, and fire shall consume them: and you shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have set my face against them.
<br>8	And I shall have made their land a wilder- ness, and desolate, because they have been trans- gressors, saith the Lord God.
<br>
<br>Chapter 16
<br>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
<br>2	Son of man, make known to Jerusalem her abominations.
<br>3	And thou shalt say: Thus saith the Lord God to Jerusalem: Thy root, and thy nativity is of the land of Chanaan, thy father was an Am- orrhite, and thy mother a Cethite.
<br>4	And when thou wast born, in the day of thy nativity thy navel was not cut, neither wast thou washed with water for thy health, nor salted with salt, nor swaddled with clouts.
<br>5	No eye had pity on thee to do any of these things for thee, out of compassion to thee: but thou wast cast out upon the face of the earth in the abjection of thy soul, in the day that thou wast born.
<br>6	And passing by thee, I saw that thou wast trodden under foot in thy own blood: and I said to thee when thou wast in thy blood: Live: I have said to thee: Live in thy blood.
<br>7	I caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field: and thou didst increase and grow great, and advancedst, and camest to woman’s orna- ment: thy breasts were fashioned, and thy hair grew: and thou was naked, and full of confusion. 8 And I passed by thee, and saw thee: and behold thy time was the time of lovers: and I spread my garment over thee, and covered thy ignominy. and I swore to thee, and I entered
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord God: and thou becamest mine.
<br>9	And I washed thee with water, and cleansed away thy blood from thee: and I anointed thee with oil.
<br>10	And I clothed thee with embroidery, and shod thee with violet coloured shoes: and I girded thee about with fine linen, and clothed thee with fine garments.
<br>11	I decked thee also with ornaments, and put bracelets on thy hands, and a chain about thy neck.
<br>12	And I put a jewel upon thy forehead and earrings in thy ears, and a beautiful crown upon thy head.
<br>13	And thou wast adorned with gold, and sil- ver, and wast clothed with fine linen, and em- broidered work, and many colours: thou didst eat fine flour, and honey, and oil, and wast made exceeding beautiful: and wast advanced to be a queen.
<br>14	And thy renown went forth among the nations for thy beauty: for thou wast perfect through my beauty, which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord God.
<br>15	But trusting in thy beauty, thou playedst the harlot because of thy renown, and thou hast prostituted thyself to every passenger, to be his. 16 And taking of thy garments thou hast made thee high places sewed together on each side: and hast played the harlot upon them, as hath
<br>not been done before, nor shall be hereafter.
<br>17	And thou tookest thy beautiful vessels, of my gold, and my silver, which I gave thee, and thou madest thee images of men, and hast com- mitted fornication with them.
<br>18	And thou tookest thy garments of divers colours, and coveredst them: and settest my oil and my sweet incense before them.
<br>19	And my bread which I gave thee, the fine
<br> 
<br>flour, and oil, and honey, wherewith I fed thee, thou hast set before them for a sweet odour; and it was done, saith the Lord God.
<br>20	And thou hast taken thy sons, and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne to me: and hast sacrificed the same to them to be devoured. Is thy fornication small?
<br>21	Thou hast sacrificed and given my children to them, consecrating them by fire.
<br>22	And after all thy abominations, and forni- cations, thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked, and full of confusion, trodden under foot in thy own blood. 23 And it came to pass after all thy wickedness
<br>(woe, woe to thee, saith the Lord God)
<br>24	That thou didst also build thee a common stew, and madest thee a brothel house in every street.
<br>25	At every head of the way thou hast set up a sign of thy prostitution: and hast made thy beauty to be abominable: and hast prostituted thyself to every one that passed by, and hast multiplied thy fornications.
<br>26	And thou hast committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours, men of large bod- ies, and hast multiplied thy fornications to pro- voke me.
<br>27	Behold, I will stretch out my hand upon thee, and will take away thy justification: and I will deliver thee up to the will of the daughters of the Philistines that hate thee, that are ashamed of thy wicked way.
<br>28	Thou hast also committed fornication with the Assyrians, because thou wast not yet satis- fied: and after thou hadst played the harlot with them, even so thou wast not contented.
<br>29	Thou hast also multiplied thy fornications in the land of Chanaan with the Chaldeans: and neither so wast thou satisfied.
<br>30	Wherein shall I cleanse thy heart, saith
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Lord God: seeing thou dost all these the works of a shameless prostitute?
<br>31	Because thou hast built thy brothel house at the head of every way, and thou hast made thy high place in every street: and wast not as a harlot that by disdain enhanceth her price,
<br>32	But is an adulteress, that bringeth in strangers over her husband.
<br>33	Gifts are given to all harlots: but thou hast given hire to all thy lovers, and thou hast given them gifts to come to thee from every side, to commit fornication with thee.
<br>34	And it hath happened in thee contrary to the custom of women in thy fornications, and after thee there shall be no such fornication, for in that thou gavest rewards, and didst not take rewards, the contrary hath been done in thee.
<br>35	Therefore, O harlot, hear the word of the Lord.
<br>36	Thus saith the Lord God: Because thy money hath been poured out, and thy shame dis- covered through thy fornications with thy lovers, and with the idols of thy abominations, by the blood of thy children whom thou gavest them:
<br>37	Behold, I will gather together all thy lovers with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all whom thou hast loved, with all whom thou hast hated: and I will gather them together against thee on every side, and will discover thy shame in their sight, and they shall see all thy nakedness. 38 And I will judge thee as adulteresses, and they that shed blood are judged: and I will give
<br>thee blood in fury and jealousy.
<br>39	And I will deliver thee into their hands, and they shall destroy thy brothel house, and throw down thy stews: and they shall strip thee of thy garments, and shall take away the vessels of thy beauty: and leave thee naked, and full of disgrace.
<br>40	And they shall bring upon thee a multi-
<br> 
<br>tude, and they shall stone thee with stones, and shall slay thee with their swords.
<br>41	And they shall burn thy houses with fire, and shall execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women: and thou shalt cease from fornication, and shalt give no hire any more.
<br>42	And my indignation shall rest in thee: and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will cease and be angry no more.
<br>43	Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast provoked me in all these things: wherefore I also have turned all thy ways upon thy head, saith the Lord God, and I have not done according to thy wicked deeds in all thy abominations.
<br>44	Behold every one that useth a common proverb, shall use this against thee, saying: As the mother was, so also is her daughter.
<br>45	Thou art thy mother’s daughter, that cast off her husband, and her children: and thou art the sister of thy sisters, who cast off their hus- bands, and their children: your mother was a Cethite, and your father an Amorrhite.
<br>46	And thy elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand: and thy younger sister that dwelleth at thy right hand is Sodom, and her daughters.
<br>47	But neither hast thou walked in their ways, nor hast thou done a little less than they accord- ing to their wickednesses: thou hast done almost more wicked things than they in all thy ways.
<br>48	As I live, saith the Lord God, thy sister Sodom herself, and her daughters, have not done as thou hast done, and thy daughters.
<br>49	Behold this was the iniquity of Sodom thy sister, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance, and the idleness of her, and of her daughters: and they did not put forth their hand to the needy, and the poor.
<br>50	And they were lifted up, and committed
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>abominations before me: and I took them away as thou hast seen.
<br>51	And Samaria committed not half thy sins: but thou hast surpassed them with thy crimes, and hast justified thy sisters by all thy abomina- tions which thou hast done.
<br>52	Therefore do thou also bear thy confusion, thou that hast surpassed thy sisters with thy sins, doing more wickedly than they: for they are justified above thee, therefore be thou also confounded, and bear thy shame, thou that hast justified thy sisters.
<br>53	And I will bring back and restore them by bringing back Sodom, with her daughters, and by bringing back Samaria, and her daughters: and I will bring those that return of thee in the midst of them.
<br>54	That thou mayest bear thy shame, and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done, comforting them.
<br>55	And thy sister Sodom and her daughters shall return to their ancient state: and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their ancient state: and thou and thy daughters shall return to your ancient state.
<br>56	And Sodom thy sister was not heard of in thy mouth, in the day of thy pride,
<br>57	Before thy malice was laid open: as it is at this time, making thee a reproach of the daugh- ters of Syria, and of all the daughters of Pales- tine round about thee, that encompass thee on all sides.
<br>58	Thou hast borne thy wickedness, and thy disgrace, saith the Lord God.
<br>59	For thus saith the Lord God: I will deal with thee, as thou hast despised the oath, in breaking the covenant:
<br>60	And I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth: and I will establish with thee an everlasting covenant.
<br> 
<br>61	And thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed: when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thy elder and thy younger: and I will give them to thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant. 62 And I will establish my covenant with thee:
<br>and thou shalt know that I am the Lord,
<br>63 That thou mayest remember, and be con- founded, and mayest no more open thy mouth because of thy confusion, when I shall be paci- fied toward thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord God.
<br>
<br>Chapter 17
<br>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
<br>2	Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable to the house of Israel,
<br>3	And say: Thus saith the Lord God; A large eagle with great wings, long-limbed, full of feath- ers, and of variety, came to Libanus, and took away the marrow of the cedar.
<br>4	He cropped off the top of the twigs thereof: and carried it away into the land of Chanaan, and he set it in a city of merchants.
<br>5	And he took of the seed of the land, and put it in the ground for seed, that it might take a firm root over many waters: he planted it on the surface of the earth.
<br>6	And it sprung up and grew into a spread- ing vine of low stature, and the branches thereof looked towards him: and the roots thereof were under him. So it became a vine, and grew into branches, and shot forth sprigs.
<br>7	And there was another large eagle, with great wings, and many feathers: and behold this vine, bending as it were her roots towards him, stretched forth her branches to him, that he might water it by the furrows of her plantation. 8 It was planted in a good ground upon many
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>waters, that it might bring forth branches, and bear fruit, that it might become a large vine.
<br>9	Say thou: Thus saith the Lord God: Shall it prosper then? shall he not pull up the roots thereof, and strip off its fruit, and dry up all the branches it hath shot forth, and make it wither: and this without a strong arm, or many people to pluck it up by the root?
<br>10	Behold, it is planted: shall it prosper then? shall it not be dried up when the burning wind shall touch it, and shall it not wither in the fur- rows where it grew?
<br>11	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
<br>12	Say to the provoking house: Know you not what these things mean? Tell them: Behold the king of Babylon cometh to Jerusalem: and he shall take away the king and the princes thereof and carry them with him to Babylon.
<br>13	And he shall take one of the king’s seed, and make a covenant with him, and take an oath of him. Yea, and he shall take away the mighty men of the land,
<br>14	That it may be a low kingdom and not lift itself up, but keep his covenant and observe it.
<br>15	But he hath revolted from him and sent ambassadors to Egypt, that it might give him horses, and much people. And shall he that hath done thus prosper, or be saved? and shall he escape that hath broken the covenant?
<br>16	As I live, saith the Lord God: In the place where the king dwelleth that made him king, whose oath he hath made void, and whose covenant he broke, even in the midst of Babylon shall he die.
<br>17	And not with a great army, nor with much people shall Pharao fight against him: when he shall cast up mounts, and build forts, to cut off many souls.
<br>18	For he had despised the oath, breaking his
<br> 
<br>covenant, and behold he hath given his hand: and having done all these things, he shall not escape.
<br>19	Therefore thus saith the Lord God: As I live, I will lay upon his head the oath he hath despised, and the covenant he hath broken.
<br>20	And I will spread my net over him, and he shall be taken in my net: and I will bring him into Babylon, and will judge him there for the transgression by which he hath despised me.
<br>21	And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword: and the residue shall be scat- tered into every wind: and you shall know that I the Lord have spoken.
<br>22	Thus saith the Lord God: I myself will take of the marrow of the high cedar, and will set it: I will crop off a tender twig from the top of the branches thereof, and I will plant it on a mountain high and eminent.
<br>23	On the high mountains of Israel will I plant it, and it shall shoot forth into branches and shall bear fruit, and it shall become a great cedar: and all birds shall dwell under it, and every fowl shall make its nest under the shadow of the branches thereof.
<br>24	And all the trees of the country shall know that I the Lord have brought down the high tree, and exalted the low tree: and have dried up the green tree, and have caused the dry tree to flour- ish. I the Lord have spoken and have done it.
<br>
<br>Chapter 18
<br>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: What is the meaning?
<br>2	That you use among you this parable as a proverb in the land of Israel, saying: The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the teeth of the chil- dren are set on edge.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>3	As I live, saith the Lord God, this parable shall be no more to you a proverb in Israel.
<br>4	Behold all souls are mine: as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, the same shall die.
<br>5	And if a man be just, and do judgment and justice,
<br>6	And hath not eaten upon the mountains, nor lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel: and hath not defiled his neighbour’s wife, nor come near to a menstruous woman:
<br>7	And hath not wronged any man: but hath restored the pledge to the debtor, hath taken nothing away by violence: hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment:
<br>8	Hath not lent upon usury, nor taken any increase: hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, and hath executed true judgment between man and man:
<br>9	Hath walked in my commandments, and kept my judgments, to do truth: he is just, he shall surely live, saith the Lord God.
<br>10	And if he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that hath done some one of these things:
<br>11	Though he doth not all these things, but that eateth upon the mountains, and that de- fileth his neighbour’s wife:
<br>12	That grieveth the needy and the poor, that taketh away by violence, that restoreth not the pledge, and that lifteth up his eyes to idols, that comitteth abomination:
<br>13	That giveth upon usury, and that taketh an increase: shall such a one live? he shall not live. Seeing he hath done all these detestable things, he shall surely die, his blood shall be upon him. 14 But if he beget a son, who, seeing all his father’s sins, which he hath done, is afraid, and
<br>shall not do the like to them:
<br> 
<br>15 That hath not eaten upon the mountains, nor lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, and hath not defiled his neighbour’s wife: 16 And hath not grieved any man, nor with- holden the pledge, nor taken away with violence, but hath given his bread to the hungry, and cov-
<br>ered the naked with a garment:
<br>17	That hath turned away his hand from in- juring the poor, hath not taken usury and in- crease, but hath executed my judgments, and hath walked in my commandments: this man shall not die for the iniquity of his father, but living he shall live.
<br>18	As for his father, because he oppressed and offered violence to his brother, and wrought evil in the midst of his people, behold he is dead in his own iniquity.
<br>19	And you say: Why hath not the son borne the iniquity of his father? Verily, because the son hath wrought judgment and justice, hath kept all my commandments, and done them, living, he shall live.
<br>20	The soul that sinneth, the same shall die: the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, and the father shall not bear the iniquity of the son: the justice of the just shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.
<br>21	But if the wicked do penance for all his sins which he hath committed, and keep all my commandments, and do judgment, and justice, living he shall live, and shall not die.
<br>22	I will not remember all his iniquities that he hath done: in his justice which he hath wrought, he shall live.
<br>23	Is it my will that a sinner should die, saith the Lord God, and not that he should be con- verted from his ways, and live?
<br>24	But if the just man turn himself away from his justice, and do iniquity according to all the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>abominations which the wicked man useth to work, shall he live? all his justices which he hath done, shall not be remembered: in the prevarica- tion, by which he hath prevaricated, and in his sin, which he hath committed, in them he shall die.
<br>25	And you have said: The way of the Lord is not right. Hear ye, therefore, O house of Israel: Is it my way that is not right, and are not rather your ways perverse?
<br>26	For when the just turneth himself away from his justice, and comitteth iniquity, he shall die therein: in the injustice that he hath wrought he shall die.
<br>27	And when the wicked turneth himself away from his wickedness, which he hath wrought, and doeth judgment, and justice: he shall save his soul alive.
<br>28	Because he considereth and turneth away himself from all his iniquities which he hath wrought, he shall surely live, and not die.
<br>29	And the children of Israel say: The way of the Lord is not right. Are not my ways right, O house of Israel, and are not rather your ways perverse?
<br>30	Therefore will I judge every man according to his ways, O house of Israel, saith the Lord God. Be converted, and do penance for all your iniquities: and iniquity shall not be your ruin.
<br>31	Cast away from you all your transgressions, by which you have transgressed, and make to yourselves a new heart, and a new spirit: and why will you die, O house of Israel?
<br>32	For I desire not the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord God, return ye and live.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 19
<br>Moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,
<br>2	And say: Why did thy mother the lioness lie down among the lions, and bring up her whelps in the midst of young lions?
<br>3	And she brought out one of her whelps, and he became a lion: and he learned to catch the prey, and to devour men.
<br>4	And the nations heard of him, and took him, but not without receiving wounds: and they brought him in chains into the land of Egypt.
<br>5	But she seeing herself weakened, and that her hope was lost, took one of her young lions, and set him up for a lion.
<br>6	And he went up and down among the lions, and became a lion: and he learned to catch the prey, and to devour men.
<br>7	He learned to make widows, and to lay waste their cities: and the land became desolate, and the fulness thereof by the noise of his roaring.
<br>8	And the nations came together against him on every side out of the provinces, and they spread their net over him, in their wounds he was taken.
<br>9	And they put him into a cage, they brought him in chains to the king of Babylon: and they cast him into prison, that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel.
<br>10	Thy mother is like a vine in thy blood planted by the water: her fruit and her branches have grown out of many waters.
<br>11	And she hath strong rods to make scep- tres for them that bear rule, and her stature was exalted among the branches: and she saw her height in the multitude of her branches.
<br>12	But she was plucked up in wrath, and cast on the ground, and the burning wind dried up her fruit: her strong rods are withered, and dried
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>up: the fire hath devoured her.
<br>13	And now she is transplanted into the desert, in a land not passable, and dry.
<br>14	And a fire is gone out from a rod of her branches, which hath devoured her fruit: so that she now hath no strong rod, to be a sceptre of rulers. This is a lamentation, and it shall be for a lamentation.
<br>
<br>Chapter 20
<br>And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, the tenth day of the month: there came men of the ancients of Israel to inquire of the Lord, and they sat before me.
<br>2	And the word of the Lord came to me, say- ing:
<br>3	Son of man, speak to the ancients of Israel and say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: Are you come to inquire of me? As I live, I will not answer you, saith the Lord God.
<br>4	If thou judgest them, if thou judgest, O son of man, declare to them the abominations of their fathers.
<br>5	And say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: In the day when I chose Israel, and lifted up my hand for the race of the house of Jacob: and appeared to them in the land of Egypt, and lifted up my hand for them, saying: I am the Lord your God:
<br>6	In that day I lifted up my hand for them to bring them out of the land of Egypt, into a land which I had provided for them, flowing with milk and honey, which excelled amongst all lands.
<br>7	And I said to them: Let every man cast away the scandals of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I am the Lord your God. 8 But they provoked me, and would not hear- ken to me: they did not every man cast away the
<br> 
<br>abominations of his eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt: and I said I would pour out my indignation upon them, and accomplish my wrath against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.
<br>9	But I did otherwise for my name’s sake, that it might not be violated before the nations, in the midst of whom they were, and among whom I made myself known to them, to bring them out of the land of Egypt.
<br>10	Therefore I brought them out from the land of Egypt, and brought them into the desert.
<br>11	And I gave them my statutes, and I shewed them my judgments, which if a man do, he shall live in them.
<br>12	Moreover I gave them also my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them: and that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them.
<br>13	But the house of Israel provoked me in the desert: they walked not in my statutes, and they cast away my judgments, which if a man do he shall live in them: and they grievously violated my sabbaths. I said therefore that I would pour out my indignation upon them in the desert, and would consume them.
<br>14	But I spared them for the sake of my name, lest it should be profaned before the nations, from which I brought them out, in their sight.
<br>15	So I lifted up my hand over them in the desert, not to bring them into the land which I had given them flowing with milk and honey, the best of all lands.
<br>16	Because they cast off my judgments, and walked not in my statutes, and violated my sab- baths: for their heart went after idols.
<br>17	Yet my eye spared them, so that I de- stroyed them not: neither did I consume them in the desert.
<br>18	And I said to their children in the wilder-
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>ness: Walk not in the statutes of your fathers, and observe not their judgments, nor be ye de- filed with their idols:
<br>19	I am the Lord your God: walk ye in my statutes, and observe my judgments, and do them.
<br>20	And sanctify my sabbaths, that they may be a sign between me and you: and that you may know that I am the Lord your God.
<br>21	But their children provoked me, they walked not in my commandments, nor observed my judgments to do them: which if a man do, he shall live in them: and they violated my sab- baths: and I threatened to pour out my indig- nation upon them, and to accomplish my wrath in them in the desert.
<br>22	But I turned away my hand, and wrought for my name’s sake, that it might not be violated before the nations, out of which I brought them forth in their sight.
<br>23	Again I lifted up my hand upon them in the wilderness, to disperse them among the nations, and scatter them through the countries:
<br>24	Because they had not done my judgments, and had cast off my statutes, and had violated my sabbaths, and their eyes had been after the idols of their fathers.
<br>25	Therefore I also gave them statutes that were not good, and judgments, in which they shall not live.
<br>26	And I polluted them in their own gifts, when they offered all that opened the womb, for their offences: and they shall know that I am the Lord.
<br>27	Wherefore speak to the house of Israel, O son of man, and say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: Moreover in this also your fathers blaspheme me, when they had despised and con- temned me;
<br>28	And I had brought them into the land, for
<br> 
<br>which I lifted up my hand to give it them: they saw every high hill, and every shady tree, and there they sacrificed their victims: and there they presented the provocation of their offer- ings, and there they set their sweet odours, and poured forth their libations.
<br>29	And I said to them: What meaneth the high place to which you go? and the name thereof was called High-place even to this day.
<br>30	Wherefore say to the house of Israel: Thus saith the Lord God: Verily, you are defiled in the way of your fathers, and you commit fornication with their abominations.
<br>31	And you defile yourselves with all your idols unto this day, in the offering of your gifts, when you make your children pass through the fire: and shall I answer you, O house of Israel? As I live, saith the Lord God, I will not answer you.
<br>32	Neither shall the thought of your mind come to pass, by which you say: We will be as the Gentiles, and as the families of the earth, to worship stocks and stones.
<br>33	As I live, saith the Lord God, I will reign over you with a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out.
<br>34	And I will bring you out from the people, and I will gather you out of the countries, in which you are scattered, I will reign over you with a strong hand and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out.
<br>35	And I will bring you into the wilderness of people, and there will I plead with you face to face.
<br>36	As I pleaded against your fathers in the desert of the land of Egypt; even so will I judge you, saith the Lord God.
<br>37	And I will make you subject to my sceptre, and will bring you into the bands of the covenant. 38 And I will pick out from among you the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>transgressors, and the wicked, and will bring them out of the land where they sojourn, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and you shall know that I am the Lord.
<br>39	And as for you, O house of Israel: thus saith the Lord God: Walk ye every one after your idols, and serve them.   But if in this also you hear me not, but defile my holy name any more with your gifts, and with your idols;
<br>40	In my holy mountain, in the high mountain of Israel, saith the Lord God, there shall all the house of Israel serve me; all of them I say, in the land in which they shall please me, and there will I require your firstfruits, and the chief of your tithes with all your sanctifications.
<br>41	I will accept of you for an odour of sweet- ness, when I shall have brought you out from the people, and shall have gathered you out of the lands into which you are scattered, and I will be sanctified in you in the sight of the nations.
<br>42	And you shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have brought you into the land of Israel, into the land for which I lifted up my hand to give it to your fathers.
<br>43	And there you shall remember your ways, and all your wicked doings with which you have been defiled; and you shall be displeased with yourselves in your own sight, for all your wicked deeds which you committed.
<br>44	And you shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have done well by you for my own name’s sake, and not according to your evil ways, nor according to your wicked deeds, O house of Israel, saith the Lord God.
<br>45	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
<br>46	Son of man, set thy face against the way of the south, and drop towards the south, and prophesy against the forest of the south field.
<br>47	And say to the south forest: Hear the word
<br> 
<br>of the Lord: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold I will kindle a fire in thee, and will burn in thee every green tree, and every dry tree: the flame of the fire shall not be quenched: and every face shall be burned in it, from the south even to the north.
<br>48	And all flesh shall see, that I the Lord have kindled it, and it shall not be quenched.
<br>49	And I said: Ah, ah, ah, O Lord God: they say of me: Doth not this man speak by parables?
<br>
<br>Chapter 21
<br>
<br>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
<br>2	Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and let thy speech flow towards the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel:
<br>3	And say to the land of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God: Behold I come against thee, and I will draw forth my sword out of its sheath, and will cut off in thee the just, and the wicked.
<br>4	And forasmuch as I have cut off in thee the just and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of its sheath against all flesh, from the south even to the north.
<br>5	That all flesh may know that I the Lord have drawn my sword out of its sheath not to be turned back.
<br>6	And thou, son of man, mourn with the breaking of thy loins, and with bitterness sigh before them.
<br>7	And when they shall say to thee: Why mournest thou? thou shalt say: For that which I hear: because it cometh, and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be made feeble, and ev- ery spirit shall faint, and water shall run down every knee: behold it cometh, and it shall be done, saith the Lord God.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>8	And the word of the Lord came to me, say- ing:
<br>9	Son of man, prophesy, and say: Thus saith the Lord God: Say: The sword, the sword is sharpened, and furbished.
<br>10	It is sharpened to kill victims: it is fur- bished that it may glitter: thou removest the sceptre of my son, thou hast cut down every tree. 11 And I have given it to be furbished, that
<br>it may be handled: this sword is sharpened, and it is furbished, that it may be in the hand of the slayer.
<br>12	Cry, and howl, O son of man, for this sword is upon my people, it is upon all the princes of Israel, that are fled: they are delivered up to the sword with my people, strike therefore upon thy thigh,
<br>13	Because it is tried: and that when it shall overthrow the sceptre, and it shall not be, saith the Lord God.
<br>14	Thou therefore, O son of man, prophesy, and strike thy hands together, and let the sword be doubled, and let the sword of the slain be tripled: this is the sword of a great slaughter, that maketh them stand amazed,
<br>15	And languish in heart, and that multiplieth ruins. In all their gates I have set the dread of the sharp sword, the sword that is furbished to glitter, that is made ready for slaughter.
<br>16	Be thou sharpened, go to the right hand, or to the left, which way soever thou hast a mind to set thy face.
<br>17	And I will clap my hands together, and will satisfy my indignation: I the Lord have spoken. 18 And the word of the Lord came to me,
<br>saying:
<br>19 And thou son of man, set thee two ways, for the sword of the king of Babylon to come: both shall come forth out of one land: and with his hand he shall draw lots, he shall consult at
<br> 
<br>the head of the way of the city.
<br>20	Thou shalt make a way that the sword may come to Rabbath of the children of Ammon, and to Juda unto Jerusalem the strong city.
<br>21	For the king of Babylon stood in the high- way, at the head of two ways, seeking divination, shuffling arrows: he inquired of the idols, and consulted entrails.
<br>22	On his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to set battering rams, to open the mouth in slaughter, to lift up the voice in howl- ing, to set engines against the gates, to cast up a mount, to build forts.
<br>23	And he shall be in their eyes as one consult- ing the oracle in vain, and imitating the leisure of sabbaths: but he will call to remembrance the iniquity that they may be taken.
<br>24	Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Be- cause you have remembered your iniquity, and have discovered your prevarications, and your sins have appeared in all your devices: because, I say, You have remembered, you shall be taken with the hand.
<br>25	But thou profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come that hath been appointed in the time of iniquity:
<br>26	Thus saith the Lord God: Remove the dia- dem, take off the crown: is it not this that hath exalted the low one, and brought down him that was high?
<br>27	I will shew it to be iniquity, iniquity, iniq- uity: but this was not done till he came to whom judgment belongeth, and I will give it him.
<br>28	And thou son of man, prophesy, and say: Thus saith the Lord God concerning the children of Ammon, and concerning their reproach, and thou shalt say: O sword, O sword, come out of the scabbard to kill, be furbished to destroy, and to glitter,
<br>29	Whilst they see vain things in thy regard,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>and they divine lies: to bring thee upon the necks of the wicked that are wounded, whose appointed day is come in the time of iniquity.
<br>30	Return into thy sheath. I will judge thee in the place wherein thou wast created, in the land of thy nativity.
<br>31	And I will pour out upon thee my indig- nation: in the fire of my rage will I blow upon thee, and will give thee into the hands of men that are brutish and contrive thy destruction.
<br>32	Thou shalt be fuel for the fire, thy blood shall be in the midst of the land, thou shalt be forgotten: for I the Lord have spoken it.
<br>
<br>Chapter 22
<br>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
<br>2	And thou son of man, dost thou not judge, dost thou not judge the city of blood?
<br>3	And thou shalt shew her all her abomina- tions, and shalt say: Thus saith the Lord God: This is the city that sheddeth blood in the midst of her, that her time may come: and that hath made idols against herself, to defile herself.
<br>4	Thou art become guilty in thy blood which thou hast shed: and thou art defiled in thy idols which thou hast made: and thou hast made thy days to draw near, and hast brought on the time of thy years: therefore have I made thee a re- proach to the Gentiles, and a mockery to all countries.
<br>5	Those that are near, and those that are far from thee, shall triumph over thee: thou filthy one, infamous, great in destruction.
<br>6	Behold the princes of Israel, every one hath employed his arm in thee to shed blood.
<br>7	They have abused father and mother in thee, they have oppressed the stranger in the midst of thee, they have grieved the fatherless and widow
<br> 
<br>in thee.
<br>8	Thou hast despised my sanctuaries, and pro- faned my sabbaths.
<br>9	Slanderers have been in thee to shed blood, and they have eaten upon the mountains in thee, they have committed wickedness in the midst of thee.
<br>10	They have discovered the nakedness of their father in thee, they have humbled the un- cleanness of the menstruous woman in thee.
<br>11	And every one hath committed abomina- tion with his neighbour’s wife, and the father in law hath wickedly defiled his daughter in law, the brother hath oppressed his sister the daughter of his father in thee.
<br>12	They have taken gifts in thee to shed blood: thou hast taken usury and increase, and hast covetously oppressed thy neighbours: and thou hast forgotten me, saith the Lord God.
<br>13	Behold, I have clapped my hands at thy covetousness, which thou hast exercised: and at the blood that hath been shed in the midst of thee.
<br>14	Shall thy heart endure, or shall thy hands prevail in the days which I will bring upon thee: I the Lord have spoken, and will do it.
<br>15	And I will disperse thee in the nations, and will scatter thee among the countries, and I will put an end to thy uncleanness in thee.
<br>16	And I will possess thee in the sight of the Gentiles, and thou shalt know that I am the Lord.
<br>17	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
<br>18	Son of man, the house of Israel is become dross to me: all these are brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace: they are become the dross of silver.
<br>19	Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Be- cause you are all turned into dross, therefore be-
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>hold I will gather you together in the midst of Jerusalem.
<br>20	As they gather silver, and brass, and tin, and iron, and lead in the midst of the furnace: that I may kindle a fire in it to melt it: so will I gather you together in my fury and in my wrath, and will take my rest, and I will melt you down. 21 And will gather you together, and will burn you in the fire of my wrath, and you shall be
<br>melted in the midst thereof.
<br>22	As silver is melted in the midst of the fur- nace, so shall you be in the midst thereof: and you shall know that I am the Lord, when I have poured out my indignation upon you.
<br>23	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
<br>24	Son of man, say to her: Thou art a land that is unclean, and not rained upon in the day of wrath.
<br>25	There is a conspiracy of prophets in the midst thereof: like a lion that roareth and catch- eth the prey, they have devoured souls, they have taken riches and hire, they have made many wid- ows in the midst thereof.
<br>26	Her priests have despised my law, and have defiled my sanctuaries: they have put no differ- ence between holy and profane: nor have distin- guished between the polluted and the clean: and they have turned away their eyes from my sab- baths, and I was profaned in the midst of them. 27 Her princes in the midst of her, are like wolves ravening the prey to shed blood, and to destroy souls, and to run after gains through cov-
<br>etousness.
<br>28 And her prophets have daubed them with- out tempering the mortar, seeing vain things, and divining lies unto them, saying: Thus saith the Lord God: when the Lord hath not spoken. 29 The people of the land have used oppres- sion, and committed robbery: they afflicted the
<br> 
<br>needy and poor, and they oppressed the stranger by calumny without judgment.
<br>30	And I sought among them for a man that might set up a hedge, and stand in the gap before me in favour of the land, that I might not destroy it: and I found none.
<br>31	And I poured out my indignation upon them, in the fire of my wrath I consumed them: I have rendered their way upon their own head, saith the Lord God.
<br>
<br>Chapter 23
<br>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
<br>2	Son of man, there were two women, daugh- ters of one mother.
<br>3	And they committed fornication in Egypt, in their youth they committed fornication: there were their breasts pressed down, and the teats of their virginity were bruised.
<br>4	And their names were Oolla the elder, and Ooliba her younger sister: and I took them, and they bore sons and daughters. Now for their names, Samaria is Oolla, and Jerusalem is Ooliba.
<br>5	And Oolla committed fornication against me, and doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians that came to her,
<br>6	Who were clothed with blue, princes, and rulers, beautiful youths, all horsemen, mounted upon horses.
<br>7	And she committed her fornications with those chosen men, all sons of the Assyrians: and she defiled herself with the uncleanness of all them on whom she doted.
<br>8	Moreover also she did not forsake her forni- cations which she had committed in Egypt: for they also lay with her in her youth, and they bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>out their fornication upon her.
<br>9	Therefore have I delivered her into the hands of her lovers, into the hands of the sons of the Assyrians, upon whose lust she doted.
<br>10	They discovered her disgrace, took away her sons and daughters, and slew her with the sword: and they became infamous women, and they executed judgments in her.
<br>11	And when her sister Ooliba saw this, she was mad with lust more than she: and she car- ried her fornication beyond the fornication of her sister.
<br>12	Impudently prostituting herself to the chil- dren of the Assyrians, the princes, and rulers that came to her, clothed with divers colours, to the horsemen that rode upon horses, and to young men all of great beauty.
<br>13	And I saw that she was defiled, and that they both took one way.
<br>14	And she increased her fornications: and when she had seen men painted on the wall, the images of the Chaldeans set forth in colours,
<br>15	And girded with girdles about their reins, and with dyed turbans on their heads, the re- semblance of all the captains, the likeness of the sons of Babylon, and of the land of the Chaldeans wherein they were born,
<br>16	She doted upon them with the lust of her eyes, and she sent messengers to them into Chaldea.
<br>17	And when the sons of Babylon were come to her to the bed of love, they defiled her with their fornications, and she was polluted by them, and her soul was glutted with them.
<br>18	And she discovered her fornications, and discovered her disgrace: and my soul was alien- ated from her, as my soul was alienated from her sister.
<br>19	For she multiplied her fornications, remem- bering the days of her youth, in which she played
<br> 
<br>the harlot in the land of Egypt.
<br>20	And she was mad with lust after lying with them whose flesh is as the flesh of asses: and whose issue as the issue of horses.
<br>21	And thou hast renewed the wickedness of thy youth, when thy breasts were pressed in Egypt, and the paps of thy virginity broken.
<br>22	Therefore, Ooliba, thus saith the Lord God: Behold I will raise up against thee all thy lovers with whom thy soul hath been glut- ted: and I will gather them together against thee round about.
<br>23	The children of Babylon, and all the Chaldeans, the nobles, and the kings, and princes, all the sons of the Assyrians, beauti- ful young men, all the captains, and rulers, the princes of princes, and the renowned horsemen. 24 And they shall come upon thee well ap- pointed with chariot and wheel, a multitude of people: they shall be armed against thee on ev- ery side with breastplate, and buckler, and hel- met: and I will set judgment before them, and
<br>they shall judge thee by their judgments.
<br>25	And I will set my jealousy against thee, which they shall execute upon thee with fury: they shall cut off thy nose and thy ears: and what remains shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons, and thy daughters, and thy residue shall be devoured by fire.
<br>26	And they shall strip thee of thy garments, and take away the instruments of thy glory.
<br>27	And I will put an end to thy wickedness in thee, and thy fornication brought out of the land of Egypt: neither shalt thou lift up thy eyes to them, nor remember Egypt any more.
<br>28	For thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I will deliver thee into the hands of them whom thou hatest, into their hands with whom thy soul hath been glutted.
<br>29	And they shall  deal with  thee in hatred,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>and they shall take away all thy labours, and shall let thee go naked, and full of disgrace, and the disgrace of thy fornication shall be discov- ered, thy wickedness, and thy fornications.
<br>30	They have done these things to thee, be- cause thou hast played the harlot with the na- tions among which thou wast defiled with their idols.
<br>31	Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister and I will give her cup into thy hand.
<br>32	Thus saith the Lord God: Thou shalt drink thy sister’s cup, deep and wide: thou shalt be had in derision and scorn, which containeth very much.
<br>33	Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness, and sorrow: with the cup of grief and sadness, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.
<br>34	And thou shalt drink it, and shalt drink it up even to the dregs, and thou shalt devour the fragments thereof, thou shalt rend thy breasts: because I have spoken it, saith the Lord God.
<br>35	Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Be- cause thou hast forgotten me, and hast cast me off behind thy back, bear thou also thy wicked- ness, and thy fornications.
<br>36	And the Lord spoke to me, saying: Son of man, dost thou judge Oolla, and Ooliba, and dost thou declare to them their wicked deeds?
<br>37	Because they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands, and they have com- mitted fornication with their idols: moreover also their children, whom they bore to me, they have offered to them to be devoured.
<br>38	Yea, and they have done this to me. They polluted my sanctuary on the same day, and pro- faned my sabbaths.
<br>39	And when they sacrificed their children to their idols, and went into my sanctuary the same day to profane it: they did these things even in the midst of my house.
<br> 
<br>40	They sent for men coming from afar, to whom they had sent a messenger: and behold they came: for whom thou didst wash thyself, and didst paint thy eyes, and wast adorned with women’s ornaments.
<br>41	Thou sattest on a very fine bed, and a table was decked before thee: whereupon thou didst set my incense, and my ointment.
<br>42	And there was in her the voice of a mul- titude rejoicing: and to some that were brought of the multitude of men, and that came from the desert, they put bracelets on their hands, and beautiful crowns on their heads.
<br>43	And I said to her that was worn out in her adulteries: Now will this woman still continue in her fornication.
<br>44	And they went in to her, as to a harlot: so went they in unto Oolla, and Ooliba, wicked women.
<br>45	They therefore are just men: these shall judge them as adulteresses are judged, and as shedders of blood are judged: because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.
<br>46	For thus saith the Lord God: Bring a multi- tude upon them, and deliver them over to tumult and rapine:
<br>47	And let the people stone them with stone, and let them be stabbed with their swords: they shall kill their sons and daughters, and their houses they shall burn with fire.
<br>48	And I will take away wickedness out of the land: and all women shall learn, not to do ac- cording to the wickedness of them.
<br>49	And they shall render your wickedness upon you, and you shall bear the sins of your idols: and you shall know that I am the Lord God.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 24
<br>And the word of the Lord came to me in the ninth year, in the tenth month, the tenth day of the month, saying:
<br>2	Son of man, write thee the name of this day, on which the king of Babylon hath set himself against Jerusalem to day.
<br>3	And thou shalt speak by a figure a parable to the provoking house, and say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: Set on a pot, set it on, I say, and put water in it.
<br>4	Heap together into it the pieces thereof, every good piece, the thigh and the shoulder, choice pieces and full of bones.
<br>5	Take the fattest of the flock, and lay together piles of bones under it: the seething thereof is boiling hot, and the bones thereof are thoroughly sodden in the midst of it.
<br>6	Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose rust is in it, and its rust is not gone out of it: cast it out piece by piece, there hath no lot fallen upon it.
<br>7	For her blood is in the midst of her, she hath shed it upon the smooth rock: she hath not shed it upon the ground, that it might be covered with dust.
<br>8	And that I might bring my indignation upon her, and take my vengeance: I have shed her blood upon the smooth rock, that it should not be covered.
<br>9	Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Woe to the bloody city, of which I will make a great bonfire.
<br>10	Heap together the bones, which I will burn with fire: the flesh shall be consumed, and the whole composition shall be sodden, and the bones shall be consumed.
<br>11	Then set it empty upon burning coals, that it may be hot, and the brass thereof may be
<br> 
<br>melted: and let the filth of it be melted in the midst thereof, and let the rust of it be consumed. 12 Great pains have been taken, and the great
<br>rust thereof is not gone out, not even by fire.
<br>13	Thy uncleanness is execrable:   because I desired to cleanse thee, and thou art not cleansed from thy filthiness: neither shalt thou be cleansed, before I cause my indignation to rest in thee.
<br>14	I the Lord have spoken: it shall come to pass, and I will do it: I will not pass by, nor spare, nor be pacified: I will judge thee according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, saith the Lord.
<br>15	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
<br>16	Son of man, behold I take from thee the desire of thy eyes with a stroke, and thou shall not lament, nor weep; neither shall thy tears run down.
<br>17	Sigh in silence, make no mourning for the dead: let the tire of thy head be upon thee, and thy shoes on thy feet, and cover not thy face, nor eat the meat of mourners.
<br>18	So I spoke to the people in the morning, and my wife died in the evening: and I did in the morning as he had commanded me.
<br>19	And the people said to me: Why dost thou not tell us what these things mean that thou doest?
<br>20	And I said to them: The word of the Lord came to me, saying:
<br>21	Speak to the house of Israel: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold I will profane my sanctuary, the glory of your realm, and the thing that your eyes desire, and for which your soul feareth: your sons, and your daughters, whom you have left, shall fall by the sword.
<br>22	And you shall do as I have done: you shall not cover your faces, nor shall you eat the meat
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>of mourners.
<br>23	You shall have crowns on your heads, and shoes on your feet: you shall not lament nor weep, but you shall pine away for your iniqui- ties, and every one shall sigh with his brother.
<br>24	And Ezechiel shall be unto you for a sign of things to come: according to all that he hath done, so shall you do, when this shall come to pass: and you shall know that I am the Lord God.
<br>25	And thou, O son of man, behold in the day wherein I will take away from them their strength, and the joy of their glory, and the de- sire of their eyes, upon which their souls rest, their sons and their daughters.
<br>26	In that day when he that escapeth shall come to thee, to tell thee:
<br>27	In that day, I say, shall thy mouth be opened to him that hath escaped, and thou shalt speak, and shalt be silent no more: and thou shalt be unto them for a sign of things to come, and you shall know that I am the Lord.
<br>
<br>Chapter 25
<br>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
<br>2	Son of man, set thy face against the children of Ammon, and thou shalt prophesy of them.
<br>3	And thou shalt say to the children of Am- mon: Hear ye the word of the Lord God: Thus saith the Lord God: Because thou hast said: Ha, ha, upon my sanctuary, because it was profaned: and upon the land of Israel, because it was laid waste: and upon the house of Juda, because they are led into captivity:
<br>4	Therefore will I deliver thee to the men of the east for an inheritance, and they shall place their sheepcotes in thee, and shall set up their tents in thee: they shall eat thy fruits: and they
<br> 
<br>shall drink thy milk.
<br>5	And I will make Rabbath a stable for camels, and the children of Ammon a couching place for flocks: and you shall know that I am the Lord.
<br>6	For thus saith the Lord God: Because thou hast clapped thy hands and stamped with thy foot, and hast rejoiced with all thy heart against the land of Israel:
<br>7	Therefore behold I will stretch forth my hand upon thee, and will deliver thee to be the spoil of nations, and will cut thee off from among the people, and destroy thee out of the lands, and break thee in pieces: and thou shalt know that I am the Lord.
<br>8	Thus saith the Lord God: Because Moab and Seir have said: Behold the house of Juda is like all other nations:
<br>9	Therefore behold I will open the shoulder of Moab from the cities, from his cities, I say, and his borders, the noble cities of the land of Bethiesimoth, and Beelmeon, and Cariathaim,
<br>10	To the people of the east with the chil- dren of Ammon, and I will give it them for an inheritance: that there may be no more any re- membrance of the children of Ammon among the nations.
<br>11	And I will execute judgments in Moab: and they shall know that I am the Lord.
<br>12	Thus saith the Lord God: Because Edom hath taken vengeance to revenge herself of the children of Juda, and hath greatly offended, and hath sought revenge of them:
<br>13	Therefore thus saith the Lord God: I will stretch forth my hand upon Edom, and will take away out of it man and beast, and will make it desolate from the south: and they that are in Dedan shall fall by the sword.
<br>14	And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel: and they shall do in Edom according to my wrath, and my fury: and
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord God.
<br>15	Thus saith the Lord God: Because the Philistines have taken vengeance, and have re- venged themselves with all their mind, destroy- ing and satisfying old enmities:
<br>16	Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Behold I will stretch forth my hand upon the Philistines, and will kill the killers, and will destroy the rem- nant of the sea coast.
<br>17	And I will execute great vengeance upon them, rebuking them in fury: and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall lay my vengeance upon them.
<br>
<br>Chapter 26
<br>And it came to pass in the eleventh year, the first day of the month, that the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
<br>2	Son of man, because Tyre hath said of Jerusalem: Aha, the gates of the people are bro- ken, she is turned to me: I shall be filled, now she is laid waste.
<br>3	Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Behold I come against thee, O Tyre, and I will cause many nations to come up to thee, as the waves of the sea rise up.
<br>4	And they shall break down the walls of Tyre, and destroy the towers thereof: and I will scrape her dust from her, and make her like a smooth rock.
<br>5	She shall be a drying place for nets in the midst of the sea, because I have spoken it, saith the Lord God: and she shall be a spoil to the nations.
<br>6	Her daughters also that are in the field, shall be slain by the sword: and they shall know that I am the Lord.
<br> 
<br>7	For thus saith the Lord God: Behold I will bring against Tyre Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, the king of kings, from the north, with horses, and chariots, and horsemen, and compa- nies, and much people.
<br>8	Thy daughters that are in the field, he shall kill with the sword: and he shall compass thee with forts, and shall cast up a mount round about: and he shall lift up the buckler against thee.
<br>9	And he shall set engines of war and batter- ing rams against thy walls, and shall destroy thy towers with his arms.
<br>10	By reason of the multitude of his horses, their dust shall cover thee: thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and wheels, and chariots, when they shall go in at thy gates, as by the entrance of a city that is destroyed.
<br>11	With the hoofs of his horses he shall tread down all thy streets, thy people he shall kill with the sword, and thy famous statues shall fall to the ground.
<br>12	They shall waste thy riches, they shall make a spoil of thy merchandise: and they shall destroy thy walls, and pull down thy fine houses: and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber, and thy dust in the midst of the waters.
<br>13	And I will make the multitude of thy songs to cease, and the sound of thy harps shall be heard no more.
<br>14	And I will make thee like a naked rock, thou shalt be a drying place for nets, neither shalt thou be built any more: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord God.
<br>15	Thus saith the Lord God to Tyre: Shall not the islands shake at the sound of thy fall, and the groans of thy slain when they shall be killed in the midst of thee?
<br>16	Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones: and take off their
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>robes, and cast away their broidered garments, and be clothed with astonishment: they shall sit on the ground, and with amazement shall won- der at thy sudden fall.
<br>17	And taking up a lamentation over thee, they shall say to thee: How art thou fallen, that dwellest in the sea, renowned city that wast strong in the sea, with thy inhabitants whom all did dread?
<br>18	Now shall the ships be astonished in the day of thy terror: and the islands in the sea shall be troubled because no one cometh out of thee. 19 For thus saith the Lord God: When I shall make thee a desolate city like the cities that are not inhabited: and shall bring the deep upon
<br>thee, and many waters shall cover thee:
<br>20	And when I shall bring thee down with those that descend into the pit to the everlasting people, and shall set thee in the lowest parts of the earth, as places desolate of old, with them that are brought down into the pit, that thou be not inhabited: and when I shall give glory in the land of the living,
<br>21	I will bring thee to nothing, and thou shalt not be, and if thou be sought for, thou shalt not be found any more for ever, saith the Lord God.
<br>
<br>Chapter 27
<br>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
<br>2	Thou therefore, O son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyre:
<br>3	And say to Tyre that dwelleth at the entry of the sea, being the mart of the people for many islands: Thus saith the Lord God: O Tyre, thou hast said: I am of perfect beauty,
<br>4	And situate in the heart of the sea. Thy neighbours, that built thee, have perfected thy beauty:
<br> 
<br>5	With fir trees of Sanir they have built thee with all sea planks: they have taken cedars from Libanus to make thee masts.
<br>6	They have cut thy oars out of the oaks of Basan: and they have made thee benches of In- dian ivory and cabins with things brought from the islands of Italy.
<br>7	Fine broidered linen from Egypt was woven for thy sail, to be spread on thy mast: blue and purple from the islands of Elisa, were made thy covering.
<br>8	The inhabitants of Sidon, and the Arabians were thy rowers: thy wise men, O Tyre, were thy pilots.
<br>9	The ancients of Gebal, and the wise men thereof furnished mariners for the service of thy various furniture: all the ships of the sea, and their mariners were thy factors.
<br>10	The Persians, and Lydians, and the Libyans were thy soldiers in thy army: they hung up the buckler and the helmet in thee for thy or- nament.
<br>11	The men of Arad were with thy army upon thy walls round about: the Pygmeans also that were in thy towers, hung up their quivers on thy walls round about: they perfected thy beauty.
<br>12	The Carthaginians thy merchants supplied thy fairs with a multitude of all kinds of riches, with silver, iron, tin, and lead,
<br>13	Greece, Thubal, and Mosoch, they were thy merchants, they brought to thy people slaves and vessels of brass.
<br>14	From the house of Thogorma they brought horses, and horsemen, and mules to thy market. 15 The men of Dedan were thy merchants: many islands were the traffic of thy hand, they exchanged for thy price teeth of ivory and ebony. 16 The Syrian was thy merchant: by reason of the multitude of thy works, they set forth pre- cious stories, and purple, and broidered works,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>and fine linen, and silk, and chodchod in thy market.
<br>17	Juda and the land of Israel, they were thy merchants with the best corn: they set forth balm, and honey, and oil and rosin in thy fairs.
<br>18	The men of Damascus were thy merchants in the multitude of thy works, the multitude of divers riches, in rich wine, in wool of the best colour.
<br>19	Dan, and Greece, and Mosel have set forth in thy marts wrought iron: stacte, and calamus were in thy market.
<br>20	The men of Dedan were thy merchants in tapestry for seats.
<br>21	Arabia, and all the princes of Cedar, they were the merchants of thy hand: thy merchants came to thee with lambs, and rams, and kids.
<br>22	The sellers of Saba, and Reema, they were thy merchants: with all the best spices, and pre- cious stones, and gold, which they set forth in thy market.
<br>23	Haran, and Chene, and Eden were thy mer- chants; Saba, Assur, and Chelmad sold to thee. 24 They were thy merchants in divers man- ners, with bales  of blue cloth, and of embroi- dered work, and of precious riches, which were wrapped up and bound with cords: they had
<br>cedars also in thy merchandise.
<br>25	The ships of the sea, were thy chief in thy merchandise: and thou wast replenished, and glorified exceedingly in the heart of the sea.
<br>26	Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters: the south wind hath broken thee in the heart of the sea.
<br>27	Thy riches, and thy treasures, and thy manifold furniture, thy mariners, and thy pilots, who kept thy goods, and were chief over thy peo- ple: thy men of war also, that were in thee, with all thy multitude that is in the midst of thee: shall fall in the heart of the sea in the day of thy
<br> 
<br>ruin.
<br>28	Thy fleets shall be troubled at the sound of the cry of thy pilots.
<br>29	And all that handled the oar shall come down from their ships: the mariners, and all the pilots of the sea shall stand upon the land:
<br>30	And they shall mourn over thee with a loud voice and shall cry bitterly: and they shall cast up dust upon their heads and shall be sprinkled with ashes.
<br>31	And they shall shave themselves bald for thee, and shall be girded with haircloth: and they shall weep for thee with bitterness of soul, with most bitter weeping.
<br>32	And they shall take up a mournful song for thee, and shall lament thee: What city is like Tyre, which is become silent in the midst of the sea?
<br>33	Which by thy merchandise that went from thee by sea didst fill many people: which by the multitude of thy riches, and of thy people didst enrich the kings of the earth.
<br>34	Now thou art destroyed by the sea, thy riches are in the bottom of the waters, and all the multitude that was in the midst of thee is fallen.
<br>35	All the inhabitants of the islands are as- tonished at thee: and all their kings being struck with the storm have changed their countenance.
<br>36	The merchants of people have hissed at thee: thou art brought to nothing, and thou shalt never be any more.
<br>
<br>Chapter 28
<br>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
<br>2 Son of man, say to the prince of Tyre: Thus saith the Lord God: Because thy heart is lifted up, and thou hast said: I am God, and I sit in
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>the chair of God in the heart of the sea: whereas thou art a man, and not God: and hast set thy heart as if it were the heart of God.
<br>3	Behold thou art wiser than Daniel: no secret is hid from thee.
<br>4	In thy wisdom and thy understanding thou hast made thyself strong: and hast gotten gold an silver into thy treasures.
<br>5	By the greatness of thy wisdom, and by thy traffic thou hast increased thy strength: and thy heart is lifted up with thy strength.
<br>6	Therefore, thus saith the Lord God: Because thy heart is lifted up as the heart of God:
<br>7	Therefore behold, I will bring upon thee strangers: the strongest of the nations: and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom, and they shall defile thy beauty.
<br>8	They shall kill thee, and bring thee down: and thou shalt die the death of them that are slain in the heart of the sea.
<br>9	Wilt thou yet say before them that slay thee: I am God; whereas thou art a man, and not God, in the hand of them that slay thee?
<br>10	Thou shalt die the death of the uncircum- cised by the hand of strangers: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord God.
<br>11	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyre:
<br>12	And say to him: Thus saith the Lord God: Thou wast the seal of resemblance, full of wis- dom, and perfect in beauty.
<br>13	Thou wast in the pleasures of the par- adise of God: every precious stone was thy cov- ering: the sardius, the topaz, and the jasper, the chrysolite, and the onyx, and the beryl, the sap- phire, and the carbuncle, and the emerald: gold the work of thy beauty: and thy pipes were pre- pared in the day that thou wast created.
<br> 
<br>14	Thou a cherub stretched out, and protect- ing, and I set thee in the holy mountain of God, thou hast walked in the midst of the stones of fire.
<br>15	Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day of thy creation, until iniquity was found in thee.
<br>16	By the multitude of thy merchandise, thy inner parts were filled with iniquity, and thou hast sinned: and I cast thee out from the moun- tain of God, and destroyed thee, O covering cherub, out of the midst of the stones of fire.
<br>17	And thy heart was lifted up with thy beauty: thou hast lost thy wisdom in thy beauty, I have cast thee to the ground: I have set thee before the face of kings, that they might behold thee.
<br>18	Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thy iniquities, and by the iniquity of thy traffic: therefore I will bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, to devour thee, and I will make thee as ashes upon the earth in the sight of all that see thee.
<br>19	All that shall see thee among the nations, shall be astonished at thee: thou art brought to nothing, and thou shalt never be any more.
<br>20	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
<br>21	Son of man, set thy face against Sidon: and thou shalt prophesy of it,
<br>22	And shalt say: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold I come against thee, Sidon, and I will be glorified in the midst of thee: and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall execute judgments in her, and shall be sanctified in her. 23 And I will send into her pestilence, and blood in her streets: and they shall fall being slain by the sword on all sides in the midst thereof: and they shall know that I am the Lord. 24 And the house of Israel shall have no more a
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>stumblingblock of bitterness, nor a thorn causing pain on every side round about them, of them that are against them: and they shall know that I am the Lord God.
<br>25	Thus saith the Lord God: When I shall have gathered together the house of Israel out of the people among whom they are scattered: I will be sanctified in them before the Gentiles: and they shall dwell in their own land, which I gave to my servant Jacob.
<br>26	And they shall dwell therein secure, and they shall build houses, and shall plant vine- yards, and shall dwell with confidence, when I shall have executed judgments upon all that are their enemies round about: and they shall know that I am the Lord their God.
<br>
<br>Chapter 29
<br>In the tenth year, the tenth month, the eleventh day of the month, the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
<br>2	Son of man, set thy face against Pharao king of Egypt: and thou shalt prophesy of him, and of all Egypt:
<br>3	Speak, and say: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I come against thee, Pharao king of Egypt, thou great dragon that liest in the midst of thy rivers, and sayest: The river is mine, and I made myself.
<br>4	But I will put a bridle in thy jaws: and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick to thy scales: and I will draw thee out of the midst of thy rivers, and all thy fish shall stick to thy scales.
<br>5	And I will cast thee forth into the desert, and all the fish of thy river: thou shalt fall upon the face of the earth, thou shalt not be taken up, nor gathered together: I have given thee for
<br> 
<br>meat to the beasts of the earth, and to the fowls of the air.
<br>6	And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the Lord: because thou hast been a staff of a reed to the house of Israel.
<br>7	When they took hold of thee with the hand thou didst break, and rent all their shoulder: and when they leaned upon thee, thou brokest, and weakenest all their loins.
<br>8	Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I will bring the sword upon thee:   and cut off man and beast out of thee.
<br>9	And the land of Egypt shall become a desert, and a wilderness: and they shall know that I am the Lord, because thou hast said: The river is mine, and I made it.
<br>10	Therefore, behold I come against thee, and thy rivers: and I will make the land of Egypt ut- terly desolate, and wasted by the sword, from the tower of Syene, even to the borders of Ethiopia. 11 The foot of man shall not pass through it, neither shall the foot of beasts go through it: nor
<br>shall it be inhabited during forty years.
<br>12	And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the lands that are desolate, and the cities thereof in the midst of the cites that are destroyed, and they shall be desolate for forty years: and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.
<br>13	For thus saith the Lord God: At the end of forty years I will gather the Egyptians from the people among whom they had been scattered.
<br>14	And I will bring back the captivity of Egypt, and will place them in the land of Pha- tures, in the land of their nativity, and they shall be there a low kingdom:
<br>15	It shall be the lowest among other king- doms, and it shall no more be exalted over the nations, and I will diminish them that they shall
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>rule no more over the nations.
<br>16	And they shall be no more a confidence to the house of Israel, teaching iniquity, that they may flee, and follow them: and they shall know that I am the Lord God.
<br>17	And it came to pass in the seven and twen- tieth year in the first month, in the first of the month: that the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
<br>18	Son of man, Nabuchodonosor king of Baby- lon hath made his army to undergo hard service against Tyre: every head was made bald, and every shoulder was peeled and there hath been no reward given him, nor his army for Tyre, for the service that he rendered me against it.
<br>19	Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Be- hold, I will set Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon in the land of Egypt: and he shall take her multitude, and take the booty thereof for a prey, and rifle the spoils thereof: and it shall be wages for his army.
<br>20	And for the service that he hath done me against it: I have given him the land of Egypt, because he hath laboured for me, saith the Lord God.
<br>21	In that day a horn shall bud forth to the house of Israel, and I will give thee an open mouth in the midst of them: and they shall know that I am the Lord.
<br>
<br>Chapter 30
<br>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
<br>2	Son of man prophesy, and say: Thus saith the Lord God:  Howl ye, Woe, woe to the day:
<br>3	For the day is near, yea the day of the Lord is near: a cloudy day, it shall be the time of the nations.
<br>4	And the sword shall come upon Egypt:
<br> 
<br>and there shall be dread in Ethiopia, when the wounded shall fall in Egypt, and the multitude thereof shall be taken away, and the foundations thereof shall be destroyed.
<br>5	Ethiopia, and Libya, and Lydia, and all the rest of the crowd, and Chub, and the children of the land of the covenant, shall fall with them by the sword.
<br>6	Thus saith the Lord God: They also that uphold Egypt shall fall, and the pride of her em- pire shall be brought down: from the tower of Syene shall they fall in it by the sword, saith the Lord the God of hosts.
<br>7	And they shall be desolate in the midst of the lands that are desolate, and the cities thereof shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted. 8 And they shall know that I am the Lord: when I shall have set a fire in Egypt, and all the
<br>helpers thereof shall be destroyed.
<br>9	In that day shall messengers go forth from my face in ships to destroy the confidence of Ethiopia, and there shall be dread among them in the day of Egypt: because it shall certainly come.
<br>10	Thus saith the Lord God: I will make the multitude of Egypt to cease by the hand of Nabu- chodonosor the king of Babylon.
<br>11	He and his people with him, the strongest of nations, shall be brought to destroy the land: and they shall draw their swords upon Egypt: and shall fill the land with the slain.
<br>12	And I will make the channels of the rivers dry, and will deliver the land into the hand of the wicked: and will lay waste the land and all that is therein by the hands of strangers, I the Lord have spoken it.
<br>13	Thus saith the Lord God: I will also de- stroy the idols, and I will make an end of the idols of Memphis: and there shall: be no more a prince of the land of Egypt and I will cause a
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>terror in the land of Egypt.
<br>14	And I will destroy the land of Phatures, and will make a fire in Taphnis, and will execute judgments in Alexandria.
<br>15	And I will pour out my indignation upon Pelusium the strength of Egypt, and will cut off the multitude of Alexandria.
<br>16	And I will make a fire in Egypt: Pelusium shall be in pain like a woman in labour, and Alexandria shall be laid waste, and in Memphis there shall be daily distresses.
<br>17	The young men of Heliopolis, and of Bubas- tus shall fall by the sword, and they themselves shall go into captivity.
<br>18	And in Taphnis the day shall be darkened, when I shall break there the sceptres of Egypt, and the pride of her power shall cease in her: a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall be led into captivity.
<br>19	And I will execute judgments in Egypt: and they shall know that I am the Lord.
<br>20	And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month, in the seventh day of the month, that the word of the Lord came, me, saying:
<br>21	Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharao king of Egypt: and behold it is not bound up, to be healed, to be tied up with clothes, and swathed with linen, that it might recover strength, and hold the sword.
<br>22	Therefore, thus saith the Lord God: Be- hold, I come against Pharao king of Egypt, and I will break into pieces his strong arm, which is already broken: and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand:
<br>23	And I will disperse Egypt among the na- tions, and scatter them through the countries.
<br>24	And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and will put my sword in his hand: and I will break the arms of Pharao, and they shall groan bitterly being slain before his face.
<br> 
<br>25	And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharao shall fall: and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have given my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall have stretched it forth upon the land of Egypt.
<br>26	And I will disperse Egypt among the na- tions, and will scatter them through the coun- tries, and they shall know that I am the Lord.
<br>
<br>Chapter 31
<br>And it came to pass, in the eleventh year, the third month the first day of the month, that the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
<br>2	Son of man, speak to Pharao king of Egypt, and to his people: To whom art thou like in thy greatness?
<br>3	Behold, the Assyrian like a cedar in Libanus, with fair branches, and full of leaves, of a high stature, and his top was elevated among the thick boughs.
<br>4	The waters nourished him, the deep set him tip on high, the streams thereof ran round about his roots, and it sent, forth its rivulets to all the trees of the country.
<br>5	Therefore was his height exalted above all the trees of the country and his branches were multiplied, and his boughs were elevated because of many waters.
<br>6	And when he had spread forth his shadow, all the fowls of the air made their nests in his boughs, and all the beasts of the forest brought forth their young under his branches, and the as- sembly of many nations dwelt under his shadow. 7 And he was most beautiful for his greatness, and for the spreading of his branches: for his root
<br>was near great waters.
<br>8 The cedars in the paradise of God were not
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>higher than he, the fir trees did not equal his top, neither were the plane trees to be compared with him for branches: no tree in the paradise of God was like him in his beauty.
<br>9	For I made him beautiful and thick set with many branches: and all the trees of pleasure, that were in the paradise of God, envied him.
<br>10	Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Be- cause he was exalted in height, and shot up his top green and thick, and his heart was lifted up in his height:
<br>11	I have delivered him into the hands of the mighty one of the nations, he shall deal with him: I have cast him out according to his wickedness. 12 And strangers, and the most cruel of the nations shall cut him down, and cast him away upon the mountains, and his boughs shall fall in every valley, and his branches shall be broken on every rock of the country: and all the people of the earth shall depart from his shadow, and
<br>leave him.
<br>13	All the fowls of the air dwelt upon his ruins, and all the beasts of the field were among his branches.
<br>14	For which cause none of the trees by the waters shall exalt themselves for their height: nor shoot up their tops among the thick branches and leaves, neither shall any of them that are wa- tered stand up in their height: for they are all delivered unto death to the lowest parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down into the pit.
<br>15	Thus saith the Lord God: In the day when he went down to hell, I brought in mourning, I covered him with the deep: and I withheld its rivers, and restrained the many waters: Libanus grieved for him, and all the trees of the field trembled.
<br>16	I shook the nations with the sound of his fall, when I brought him down to hell with them
<br> 
<br>that descend into the pit: and all the trees of pleasure, the choice and best in Libanus, all that were moistened with waters, were comforted in the lowest parts of the earth.
<br>17	For they also shall go down with him to hell to them that are slain by the sword; and the arm of every one shall sit down under his shadow in the midst of the nations.
<br>18	To whom art thou like, O thou that art famous and lofty among the trees of pleasure? Behold, thou art brought down with the trees of pleasure to the lowest parts of the earth: thou shalt sleep in the midst of the uncircumcised, with them that are slain by the sword: this is Pharao, and all his multitude, saith the Lord God.
<br>
<br>Chapter 32
<br>And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first day of the month, that the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
<br>2	Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharao the king of Egypt, and say to him: Thou art like the lion of the nations, and the dragon that is in the sea: and thou didst push with the horn in thy rivers, and didst trouble the wa- ters with thy feet, and didst trample upon their streams.
<br>3	Therefore, thus saith the Lord God: I will spread out my net over thee with the multitude of many people, and I will draw thee up in my net.
<br>4	And I will throw thee out on the land, I will cast thee away into the open field and I will cause all the fowls of the air to dwell upon thee, and I will fill the beasts of all the earth with thee.
<br>5	And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and will fill thy hills with thy corruption,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>6	And I will water the earth with thy stinking blood upon the mountains, and the valleys shall be filled with thee.
<br>7	And I will cover the heavens, when thou shalt be put out, and I will make the stars thereof dark: I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give her light.
<br>8	I will make all the lights of heaven to mourn over thee and I will cause darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord God, when thy wounded shall fall in the midst of the land, saith the Lord God.
<br>9	And I shall provoke to anger the heart of many people, when I shall have brought in thy destruction among the nations upon the lands, which thou knowest not.
<br>10	And I will make many people to be amazed at thee, and their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee, when my sword shall begin to fly upon their faces: and they shall be astonished on a sudden, every one for his own life, in the day of their ruin.
<br>11	For thus saith the Lord God: The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee,
<br>12	By the swords of the mighty I will over- throw thy multitude: all these nations are invin- cible: and they shall waste the pride of Egypt, and the multitude thereof shall be destroyed.
<br>13	I will destroy also all the beasts thereof that were beside the great waters: and the foot of man shall trouble them no more, neither shall the hoof of beasts trouble them.
<br>14	Then will I make their waters clear, and cause their rivers to run like oil, saith the Lord God:
<br>15	When I shall have made the land of Egypt desolate: and the land shall be destitute of her fulness, when I shall have struck all the inhabi- tants thereof and they shall know that I am the Lord.
<br> 
<br>16	This is the lamentation, and they shall lament therewith: the daughters of the nations shall lament therewith for Egypt, and for the multitude thereof they shall lament therewith, saith the Lord God.
<br>17	And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth day of the month, that the word of the Lord came to me saying:
<br>18	Son of man, sing a mournful song for the multitude of Egypt: and cast her down, both her, and the daughters of the mighty nations to the lowest part of the earth, with them that go down into the pit.
<br>19	Whom dost thou excel in beauty? go down and sleep with the uncircumcised.
<br>20	They shall fall in the midst of them that are slain with the sword: the sword is given, they have drawn her down, and all her people.
<br>21	The most mighty among the strong ones shall speak to him from the midst of hell, they that went down with his helpers and slept uncir- cumcised, slain by the sword.
<br>22	Assur is there, and all his multitude: their graves are round about him, all of them slain, and that fell by the sword.
<br>23	Whose graves are set in the lowest parts of the pit: and his multitude lay round about his grave: all of them slain, and fallen by the sword, they that heretofore spread terror in the land of the living.
<br>24	There is Elam and all his multitude round about his grave, all of them slain, and fallen by the sword; that went down uncircumcised to the lowest parts of the earth: that caused their terror in the land of the living, and they have borne their shame with them that go down into the pit.
<br>25	In the midst of the slain they have set him a bed among all his people: their graves are round about him: all these are uncircumcised, and slain
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>by the sword: for they spread their terror in the land of the living, and have borne their shame with them that descend into the pit: they are laid in the midst of the slain.
<br>26	There is Mosoch, and Thubal, and all their multitude: their graves are round about him: all of them uncircumcised and slain, and fallen by the sword: though they spread their terror in the land of the living.
<br>27	And they shall not sleep with the brave, and with them that fell uncircumcised, that went down to hell with their weapons, and laid their swords under their heads, and their iniquities were in their bones, because they were the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.
<br>28	So thou also shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and shalt sleep with them that are slain by the sword.
<br>29	There is Edom, and her kings, and all her princes, who with their army are joined with them that are slain by the sword: and have slept with the uncircumcised, and with them that go down into the pit.
<br>30	There are all the princes of the north, and all the hunters: who were brought down with the slain, fearing, and confounded in their strength: who slept uncircumcised with them that are slain by the sword, and have borne their shame with them that go down into the pit.
<br>31	Pharao saw them, and he was comforted concerning all his multitude, which was slain by the sword: Pharao, and all his army, saith the Lord God:
<br>32	Because I have spread my terror in the land of the living, and he hath slept in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that are slain by the sword: Pharao and all his multitude, saith the Lord God.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 33
<br>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
<br>2	Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say to them: When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man, one of their meanest, and make him a watchman over them:
<br>3	And he sees the sword coming upon the land, and sound the trumpet, and tell the people:
<br>4	Then he that heareth the sound of the trum- pet, whosoever he be, and doth not look to him- self, if the sword come, and cut him off: his blood shall be upon his own head.
<br>5	He heard the sound of the trumpet, and did not look to himself, his blood shall be upon him: but if he look to himself, he shall save his life.
<br>6	And if the watchman see the sword coming, and sound not the trumpet: and the people look not to themselves, and the sword come, and cut off a soul from among them: he indeed is taken away in his iniquity, but I will require his blood at the hand of the watchman.
<br>7	So thou, O son of man, I have made thee a watchman to the house of Israel: therefore thou shalt hear the word from my mouth, and shalt tell it them from me.
<br>8	When I say to the wicked: O wicked man, thou shalt surely die: if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked man from his way: that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but I will require his blood at thy hand.
<br>9	But if thou tell the wicked man, that he may be converted from his ways, and he be not con- verted from his way he shall die in his iniquity: but thou hast delivered thy soul.
<br>10	Thou therefore, O son of man, say to the house of Israel: Thus you have spoken, saying: Our iniquities, and our sins are upon us, and we pine away in them: how then can we live?
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>11	Say to them: As I live, saith the Lord God, I desire not the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way, and live. Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways: and why will you die, O house of Israel?
<br>12	Thou therefore, O son of man, say to the children of thy people: The justice of the just shall not deliver him, in what day soever he shall sin: and the wickedness of the wicked shall not hurt him, in what day soever he shall turn from his wickedness: and the just shall not be able to live in his justice, in what day soever he shall sin.
<br>13	Yea, if I shall say to the just that he shall surely live, and he, trusting in his justice, com- mit iniquity: all his justices shall be forgotten, and his iniquity, which he hath committed, in the same shall he die.
<br>14	And it I shall say to the wicked: Thou shalt surely die: and he do penance for his sin, and do judgment and justice,
<br>15	And if that wicked man restore the pledge, and render what he had robbed, and walk in the commandments of life, and do no unjust thing: he shall surely live, and shall not die.
<br>16	None of his sins, which he hath committed, shall be imputed to him: he hath done judgment and justice, he shall surely live.
<br>17	And the children of thy people have said: The way of the Lord is not equitable: whereas their own way is unjust.
<br>18	For when the just shall depart from his jus- tice, and commit iniquities, he shall die in them. 19 And when the wicked shall depart from his wickedness, and shall do judgments, and justice,
<br>he shall live in them.
<br>20	And you say: The way of the Lord is not right, I will judge every one of you according to his ways, O house of Israel.
<br>21	And it came to pass in the twelfth year of
<br> 
<br>our captivity, in the tenth month, in the fifth day of the month, that there came to me one that was fled from Jerusalem, saying: The city is laid waste.
<br>22	And the hand of the Lord had been upon me in the evening, before he that was fled came: and he opened my mouth till he came to me in the morning, and my mouth being opened, I was silent no more.
<br>23	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
<br>24	Son of man, they that dwell in these ru- inous places in the land of Israel, speak, saying: Abraham was one, and he inherited the land, but we are many, the land is given us in possession. 25 Therefore say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: You that eat with the blood and lift up your eyes to your uncleannesses, and that shed blood: shall you possess the land by inheritance? 26 You stood on your swords, you have com- mitted abominations, and every one hath defiled his neighbours wife; and shall you possess the
<br>land by inheritance?
<br>27	Say thou thus to them: Thus saith the Lord God: As I live, they that dwell in the ruinous places, shall fall by the sword: and he that is in the field, shall be given to the beasts to be devoured: and they that are in holds, and caves, shall die of the pestilence.
<br>28	And I will make the land a wilderness, and a desert, and the proud strength thereof shall fail, and the mountains of Israel shall be deso- late, because there is none to pass by them,
<br>29	And they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have made their land waste and des- olate, for all their abominations which they have committed.
<br>30	And thou son of man: the children of thy people, that talk of thee by the walls, and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>each man to his neighbour, saying: Come, and let us hear what is the word that cometh forth from the Lord.
<br>31	And they come to thee, as if people were coming in, and my people sit before thee: and hear thy words, and do them not: for they turn them into a song of their mouth, and their heart goeth after their covetousness.
<br>32	And thou art to them as a musical song which is sung with a sweet and agreeable voice: and they hear thy words, and do them not.
<br>33	And when that which was foretold shall come to pass, for behold it is coming, then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them.
<br>
<br>Chapter 34
<br>And the word of the Lord came to me, it saying: 2 Son of man, prophesy concerning the shep- herds of Israel: prophesy, and say to the shep- herds: Thus saith the Lord God: Woe to the shepherds of Israel, that fed themselves: should
<br>not the flocks be fed by the shepherds?
<br>3	You ate the milk, and you clothed yourselves with the wool, and you killed that which was fat: but my flock you did not feed.
<br>4	The weak you have not strengthened, and that which was sick you have not healed, that which was broken you have not bound up, and that which was driven away you have not brought again, neither have you sought that which was lost: but you ruled over them with rigour, and with a high hand.
<br>5	And my sheep were scattered, because there was no shepherd and they became the prey of all the beasts of the field, and were scattered.
<br>6	My sheep have wandered in every mountain, and in every high hill: and my flocks were scat-
<br> 
<br>tered upon the face of the earth, and there was none that sought them, there was none, I say, that sought them.
<br>7	Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the Lord:
<br>8	As I live, saith the Lord God, forasmuch as my flocks have been made a spoil, and my sheep are become a prey to all the beasts of the field, because there was no shepherd: for my shepherds did not seek after my flock, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my flocks:
<br>9	Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the Lord:
<br>10	Thus saith the Lord God: Behold I myself come upon the shepherds, I will require my flock at their hand, and I will cause them to cease from feeding the flock any more, neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more: and I will deliver my flock from their mouth, and it shall no more be meat for them.
<br>11	For thus saith the Lord God: Behold I my- self will seek my sheep, and will visit them.
<br>12	As the shepherd visiteth his flock in the day when he shall be in the midst of his sheep that were scattered, so will I visit my sheep, and will deliver them out of all the places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day. 13 And I will bring them out from the peoples, and will gather them out of the countries, and will bring them to their own land: and I will feed them in the mountains of Israel, by the rivers,
<br>and in all the habitations of the land.
<br>14	I will feed them in the most fruitful pas- tures, and their pastures shall be in the high mountains of Israel: there shall they rest on the green grass, and be fed in fat pastures upon the mountains of Israel.
<br>15	I will feed my sheep: and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord God.
<br>16	I will seek that which was lost: and that
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>which was driven away, I will bring again: and I will bind up that which was broken, and I will strengthen that which was weak, and that which was fat and strong I will preserve, and I will feed them in judgment.
<br>17	And as for you, O my flocks, thus saith the Lord God: Behold I judge between cattle and cattle, of rams and of he goats.
<br>18	Was it not enough for you to feed upon good pastures? but you must also tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures: and when you drank the clearest water, you troubled the rest with your feet.
<br>19	And my sheep were fed with that which you had trodden with your feet: and they drank what your feet had troubled.
<br>20	Therefore thus saith the Lord God to you: Behold, I myself will judge between the fat cattle and the lean.
<br>21	Because you thrusted with sides and shoul- ders, and struck all the weak cattle with your horns, till they were scattered abroad:
<br>22	I will save my flock, and it shall be no more a spoil, and I will judge between cattle and cat- tle.
<br>23	And I WILL SET UP ONE SHEPHERD
<br>OVER THEM, and he shall feed them, even my servant David: he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.
<br>24	And I the Lord will be their God: and my servant David the prince in the midst of them: I the Lord have spoken it.
<br>25	And I will make a covenant of peace with them, and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land: and they that dwell in the wilderness shall sleep secure in the forests.
<br>26	And I will make them a blessing round about my hill: and I will send down the rain in its season, there shall be showers of blessing. 27 And the tree of the field shall yield its fruit,
<br> 
<br>and the earth shall yield her increase, and they shall be in their land without fear: and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have bro- ken the bonds of their yoke, and shall have de- livered them out of the hand of those that rule over them.
<br>28	And they shall be no more for a spoil to the nations, neither shall the beasts of the earth devour them: but they shall dwell securely with- out, any terror.
<br>29	And I will raise up for them a bud of renown: and they shall be no more consumed with famine in the land, neither shall they bear any more the reproach of the Gentiles.
<br>30	And they shall know that I the Lord their God am with them, and that they are my people the house of Israel:  saith the Lord God.
<br>31	And you my flocks, the flocks of my pasture are men: and I am the Lord your God, saith the Lord God.
<br>
<br>Chapter 35
<br>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
<br>2	Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy concerning it, and say to it:
<br>3	Thus saith the Lord God: Behold I come against thee, mount Seir, and I will stretch forth my hand upon thee, and I will make thee deso- late and waste.
<br>4	I will destroy thy cities, and thou shalt be desolate: and thou shalt know that I am the Lord.
<br>5	Because thou hast been an everlasting en- emy, and hast shut up the children of Israel in the hands of the sword in the time of their afflic- tion, in the time of their last iniquity.
<br>6	Therefore as I live, saith the Lord God, I will deliver thee up to blood, and blood shall pursue
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>thee: and whereas thou hast hated blood, blood shall pursue thee.
<br>7	And I will make mount Seir waste and deso- late: and I will take away from it him that goeth and him that returneth.
<br>8	And I will fill his mountains with his men that are slain: in thy hills, and in thy valleys, and in thy torrents they shall fall that are slain with the sword.
<br>9	I will make thee everlasting desolations, and thy cities shall not be inhabited: and thou shalt know that I am the Lord God.
<br>10	Because thou hast said: The two nations, and the two lands shall be mine, and I will pos- sess them by inheritance: whereas the Lord was there.
<br>11	Therefore as I live, saith the Lord God, I will do according to thy wrath, and according to thy envy, which thou hast exercised in hatred to them: and I will be made known by them, when I shall have judged thee.
<br>12	And thou shalt know that I the Lord have heard all thy reproaches, that thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying. They are desolate, they are given to us to consume.
<br>13	And you rose up against me with your mouth, and have derogated from me by your words: I have heard them.
<br>14	Thus saith the Lord God: When the whole earth shall rejoice, I will make thee a wilderness.
<br>15	As thou hast rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was laid waste, so will I do to thee: thou shalt be laid waste, O mount Seir, and all Idumea: and they shall know that I am the Lord.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 36
<br>And thou son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, and say: Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord:
<br>2	Thus saith the Lord God: Because the en- emy hath said to you: Aha, the everlasting heights are given to us for an inheritance.
<br>3	Therefore prophesy, and say: Thus saith the Lord God: Because you have been desolate, and trodden under foot on every side, and made an inheritance to the rest of the nations, and are become the subject of the talk, and the reproach of the people:
<br>4	Therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord God: Thus saith the Lord God to the mountains, and to the hills, to the brooks, and to the valleys, and to desolate places, and ruinous walls, and to the cities that are forsaken, that are spoiled, and derided by the rest of the nations round about.
<br>5	Therefore thus saith the Lord God: In the fire of my zeal I have spoken of the rest of the nations, and of all Edom, who have taken my land to themselves, for an inheritance with joy, and with all the heart, and with the mind: and have cast it out to lay it waste.
<br>6	Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains, and to the hills, to the ridges, and to the valleys: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold I have spoken in my zeal, and in my indignation, because you have borne the shame of the Gentiles.
<br>7	Therefore thus saith the Lord God: I have lifted up my hand, that the Gentiles who are round about you, shall themselves bear their shame.
<br>8	But as for you, O mountains of Israel, shoot ye forth your branches, and yield your fruit to my people of Israel: for they are at hand to come.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>9	For I, I am for you, and I will turn to you, and you shall be ploughed and sown.
<br>10	And I will multiply men upon you, and all the house of Israel: and the cities ball be inhab- ited, and the ruinous places shall be repaired.
<br>11	And I will make you abound with men and with beasts: and they shall be multiplied, and increased: and I will settle you as from the be- ginning, and will give you greater gifts, than you had from the beginning: and you shall know that I am the Lord.
<br>12	And I will bring men upon you, my peo- ple Israel, and they shall possess thee for their inheritance: and thou shalt be their inheritance, and shalt no more henceforth be without them. 13 Thus saith the Lord God: Because thy say of you: Thou art a devourer of men, and one
<br>that suffocatest thy nation:
<br>14	Therefore thou shalt devour men no more nor destroy thy nation any more, saith the Lord God.
<br>15	Neither will I cause men to hear in thee the shame of the nations any more, nor shalt thou bear the reproach of the people, nor lose thy nation any more, saith the Lord God.
<br>16	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
<br>17	Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it with their ways, and with their doings: their way was before me like the uncleanness of a menstruous woman.
<br>18	And I poured out my indignation upon them for the blood which they had shed upon the land, and with their idols they defiled it.
<br>19	And I scattered them among the nations, and they are dispersed through the countries: I have judged them according to their ways, and their devices.
<br>20	And when they entered among the nations whither they went, they profaned my holy name,
<br> 
<br>when it was said of them: This is the people of the Lord, and they are come forth out of his land. 21 And I have regarded my own holy name, which the house of Israel hath profaned among
<br>the nations to which they went in.
<br>22	Therefore thou shalt say to the house of Israel: Thus saith the Lord God: It is not for your sake that I will do this, O house of Israel, but for my holy name’s sake, which you have profaned among the nations whither you went.
<br>23	And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the Gentiles, which you have profaned in the midst of them: that the Gentiles may know that I am the Lord, saith the Lord of hosts, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.
<br>24	For I will take you from among the Gen- tiles, and will gather you together out of all the countries, and will bring you into your own land. 25 And I will pour upon you clean water, and you shall be cleansed from all your filthiness, and
<br>I will cleanse you from all your idols.
<br>26	And I will give you a new heart, and put a new spirit within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and will give you a heart of flesh.
<br>27	And I will put my spirit in the midst of you: and I will cause you to walk in my com- mandments, and to keep my judgments, and do them.
<br>28	And you shall dwell in the land which I gave to your fathers, and you shall be my people, and I will be your God.
<br>29	And I will save you from all your unclean- nesses: and I will call for corn, and will multiply it, and will lay no famine upon you.
<br>30	And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that you bear no more the reproach of famine among the nations. 31 And you shall remember your wicked ways,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>and your doings that were not good: and your iniquities, and your wicked deeds shall displease you.
<br>32	It is not for your sakes that I will do this, saith the Lord God, be it known to you: be confounded, and ashamed at your own ways, O house of Israel.
<br>33	Thus saith the Lord God: In the day that I shall cleanse you from all your iniquities, and shall cause the cities to be inhabited, and shall repair the ruinous places,
<br>34	And the desolate land shall be tilled, which before was waste in the sight of all that passed by,
<br>35	They shall say: This land that was un- tilled is become as a garden of pleasure: and the cities that were abandoned, and desolate, and destroyed, are peopled and fenced.
<br>36	And the nations, that shall be left round about you, shall know that I the Lord have built up what was destroyed, and planted what was desolate, that I the Lord have spoken and done it.
<br>37	Thus saith the Lord God: Moreover in this shall the house of Israel find me, that I will do it for them: I will multiply them as a flock of men, 38 As a holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts: so shall the waste cities be full of flocks of men: and they shall know that I
<br>am the Lord.
<br>
<br>Chapter 37
<br>The hand of the Lord was upon me, and brought me forth in the spirit of the Lord: and set me down in the midst of a plain that was full of bones.
<br>2 And he led me about through them on every side: now they were very many upon the face of
<br> 
<br>the plain, and they were exceeding dry.
<br>3	And he said to me: Son of man, dost thou think these bones shall live and I answered: O Lord God, thou knowest.
<br>4	And he said to me: Prophesy concerning these bones; and say to them: Ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord.
<br>5	Thus saith the Lord God to these bones: Behold, I will send spirit into you, and you shall live.
<br>6	And I will lay sinews upon you, and will cause flesh to grow over you, and will cover you with skin: and I will give you spirit and you shall live, and you shall know that I am the Lord.
<br>7	And I prophesied as he had commanded me: and as I prophesied there was a noise, and behold a commotion: and the bones came together, each one, its joint.
<br>8	And I saw, and behold the sinews, and the flesh came up upon them: and the skin was stretched out over them, but there was no spirit in them.
<br>9	And he said to me: Prophesy to the spirit, prophesy, O son of man, and say to the spirit: Thus saith the Lord God: Come, spirit, from the four winds, and blow upon these slain, and let them live again.
<br>10	And I prophesied as he had commanded me: and the spirit came into them, and they lived: and they stood up upon their feet, an ex- ceeding great army.
<br>11	And he said to me: Son of man: All these bones are the house of Israel: they say: Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost, and we are cut off.
<br>12	Therefore prophesy, and say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold I will open your graves, and will bring you out of your sepulchres, O my people: and will bring you into the land of Israel.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>13	And you shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have opened your sepulchres, and shall have brought you out of your graves, O my people:
<br>14	And shall have put my spirit in you, and you shall live, and I shall make you rest upon your own land: and you shall know that I the Lord have spoken, and done it, saith the Lord God:
<br>15	And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
<br>16	And thou son of man, take thee a stick: and write upon it: Of Juda, and of the chil- dren of Israel his associates: and take another stick and write upon it: For Joseph the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel, and of his associates.
<br>17	And join them one to the other into one stick, and they shall become one in thy hand.
<br>18	And when the children of thy people shall speak to thee, saying: Wilt thou not tell us what thou meanest by this?
<br>19	Say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Is- rael that are associated with him, and I will put them together with the stick of Juda, and will make them one stick: and they shall be one in his hand.
<br>20	And the sticks whereon thou hast written, shall be in thy hand, before their eyes.
<br>21	And thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I will take of the children of Israel from the midst of the nations whither they are gone: and I will gather them on every side, and will bring them to their own land.
<br>22	And I will make them one nation in the land on the mountains of Israel, and one king shall be king over them all: and they shall no more be two nations, neither shall they be di-
<br> 
<br>vided any more into two kingdoms.
<br>23	Nor shall they be defiled any more with their idols, nor with their abominations, nor with all their iniquities: and I will save them out of all the places in which they have sinned, and I will cleanse them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.
<br>24	And my servant David shall be king over them, and they shall have one shepherd: they shall walk in my judgments, and shall keep my commandments, and shall do them.
<br>25	And they shall dwell in the land which I gave to my servant Jacob, wherein your fathers dwelt, and they shall dwell in it, they and their children, and their children’s children, for ever: and David my servant shall be their prince for ever.
<br>26	And I will make a covenant of peace with them, it shall be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will establish them, and will multi- ply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for ever.
<br>27	And my tabernacle shall be with them: and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. 28 And the nations shall know that I am the Lord the sanctifier of Israel, when my sanctuary
<br>shall be in the midst of them for ever.
<br>
<br>Chapter 38
<br>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
<br>2 Son of man, set thy face against Gog, the land of Magog, the chief prince of Mosoch and Thubal: and prophesy of him,
<br>4 And I will turn thee about, and I will put a bit in thy jaws: and I will bring thee forth, and all thy army, horses and horsemen all clothed with coats of mail, a great multitude, armed with spears and shields and swords.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>5	The Persians, Ethiopians, and Libyans with them, all with shields and helmets.
<br>6	Gomer,   and   all   his   bands,   the   house of Thogorma, the northern parts and all his strength, and many peoples with thee.
<br>7	Prepare and make thyself ready, and all thy multitude that is assembled about thee, and be thou commander over them.
<br>8	After many days thou shalt be visited: at the end of years thou shalt come to the land that is returned from the sword, and is gathered out of many nations, to the mountains of Israel which have been continually waste: but it hath been brought forth out of the nations, and they shall all of them dwell securely in it.
<br>9	And thou shalt go up and come like a storm, and like a cloud to cover the land, thou and all thy bands and many people with thee.
<br>10	Thus saith the Lord God: In that day projects shall enter into thy heart, and thou shalt conceive a mischievous design.
<br>11	And thou shalt say: I will go up to the land which is without a wall, I will come to them that are at rest, and dwell securely: all these dwell without a wall, they have no bars nor gates:
<br>12	To take spoils, and lay hold on the prey, to lay thy hand upon them that had been wasted, and afterwards restored, and upon the people that is gathered together out of the nations, which hath begun to possess and to dwell in the midst of the earth.
<br>13	Saba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tharsis, and all the lions thereof shall say to thee: Art thou come to take spoils? behold, thou hast gathered thy multitude to take a prey, to take silver, and gold, and to carry away goods and substance, and to take rich spoils.
<br>14	Therefore, thou son of man, prophesy and say to Gog: Thus saith the Lord God: Shalt thou not know, in that day, when my people of Israel
<br> 
<br>shall dwell securely?
<br>15	And thou shalt come out of thy place from the northern parts, thou and many people with thee, all of them riding upon horses, a great com- pany and a mighty army.
<br>16	And thou shalt come upon my people of Israel like a cloud, to cover the earth. Thou shalt be in the latter days, and I will bring thee upon my land: that the nations may know me, when I shall be sanctified in thee, O Gog, before their eyes.
<br>17	Thus saith the Lord God: Thou then art he, of whom I have spoken in the days of old, by my servants the prophets of Israel, who prophe- sied in the days of those times that I would bring thee upon them.
<br>18	And it shall come to pass in that day, in the day of the coming of Gog upon the land of Israel, saith the Lord God, that my indignation shall come up in my wrath.
<br>19	And I have spoken in my zeal, and in the fire of my anger, that in that day there shall be a great commotion upon the land of Israel:
<br>20	So that the fishes of the sea, and the birds of the air, and the beasts of the field, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the ground, and all men that are upon the face of the earth, shall be moved at my presence: and the moun- tains shall be thrown down, and the hedges shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground.
<br>21	And I will call in the sword against him in all my mountains, saith the Lord God: every man’s sword shall be pointed against his brother. 22 And I will judge him with pestilence, and with blood, and with violent rain, and vast hail- stones: I will rain fire and brimstone upon him, and upon his army, and upon the many nations
<br>that are with him.
<br>23 And I will be magnified, and I will be sanc- tified: and I will be known in the eyes of many
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>nations and they shall know that I am the Lord.
<br>
<br>Chapter 39
<br>And thou, son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I come against thee, O Gog, the chief prince of Mosoch and Thubal.
<br>2	And I will turn thee round, and I will lead thee out, and will make thee go up from the northern parts: and will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel.
<br>3	And I will break thy bow in thy left hand, and I will cause thy arrows to fall out of thy right hand.
<br>4	Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou and all thy bands, and thy nations that are with thee: I have given thee to the wild beasts, to the birds, and to every fowl, and to the beasts of the earth to be devoured.
<br>5	Thou shalt fall upon the face of the field: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord God.
<br>6	And I will send a fire on Magog, and on them that dwell confidently in the islands: and they shall know that I am the Lord.
<br>7	And I will make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel, and my holy name shall be profaned no more: and the Gentiles shall know that I am the Lord, the Holy One of Israel. 8 Behold it cometh, and it is done, saith the Lord God: this is the day whereof I have spoken. 9 And the inhabitants shall go forth of the cities of Israel, and shall set on fire and burn the weapons, the shields, and the spears, the bows and the arrows, and the handstaves and the pikes: and they shall burn them with fire
<br>seven years.
<br>10	And they shall not bring wood out of the countries, nor cut down out of the forests: for
<br> 
<br>they shall burn the weapons with fire, and shall make a prey of them to whom they had been a prey, and they shall rob those that robbed them, saith the Lord God.
<br>11	And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give Gog a noted place for a sepulchre in Israel: the valley of the passengers on the east of the sea, which shall cause astonishment in them that pass by: and there shall they bury Gog, and all his multitude, and it shall be called the valley of the multitude of Gog.
<br>12	And the house of Israel shall bury them for seven months to cleanse the land.
<br>13	And all the people of the land shall bury him, and it shall be unto them a noted day, wherein I was glorified, saith the Lord God.
<br>14	And they shall appoint men to go contin- ually about the land, to bury and to seek out them that were remaining upon the face of the earth, that they may cleanse it: and after seven months they shall begin to seek.
<br>15	And they shall go about passing through the land: and when they shall see the bone of a man, they shall set up sign by it, till the buriers bury it in the valley, of the multitude of Gog.
<br>16	And the name of the city shall be Amona, and they shall cleanse the land.
<br>17	And thou, O son of man, saith the Lord God, say to every fowl, and to all the birds, and to all the beasts of the field: Assemble your- selves, make haste, come together from every side to my victim, which I slay for you, a great victim upon the mountains of Israel: to eat flesh, and drink blood.
<br>18	You shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and you shall drink the blood of the princes of the earth, of rams, and of lambs, and of he goats, and bullocks, and of all that are well fed and fat. 19 And you shall eat the fat till you be full, and shall drink blood till you be drunk of the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>victim which I shall slay for you.
<br>20	And you shall be filled at my table with horses, and mighty horsemen, and all the men of war, saith the Lord God.
<br>21	And I will set my glory among the nations: and all nations shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid upon them.
<br>22	And the house of Israel shall know that I am the Lord their God from that day and for- ward.
<br>23	And the nations shall know that the house of Israel were made captives for their iniquity, because they forsook me, and I hid my face from them: and I delivered them into the hands of their enemies, and they fell all by the sword.
<br>24	I have dealt with them according to their uncleanness, and wickedness, and hid my face from them.
<br>25	Therefore, thus saith the Lord God: Now will I bring back the captivity of Jacob, and will have mercy on all the house of Israel and I will be jealous for my holy name.
<br>26	And they shall bear their confusion,  and all the transgressions wherewith they have trans- gressed against me, when they shall dwell in their land securely fearing no man:
<br>27	And I shall have brought them back from among the nations, and shall have gathered them together out of the lands of their enemies, and shall be sanctified in them, in the sight of many nations.
<br>28	And they shall know that I am the Lord their God, because I caused them to be carried away among the nations; and I have gathered them together unto their own land, and have not left any of them there.
<br>29	And I will hide my face no more from them, for I have poured out my spirit upon all the house of Israel, saith the Lord God.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 40
<br>In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, the tenth day of the month, the fourteenth year after the city was destroyed: in the selfsame day the hand of the Lord was upon me, and he brought me thither. 2 In the visions of God he brought me into the land of Israel, and set me upon a very high mountain: upon which there was as the building
<br>of a city, bending towards the south.
<br>3	And he brought me in thither, and behold a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed in his hand, and he stood in the gate.
<br>4	And this man said to me: Son of man, see with thy eyes, and hear with thy ears, and set thy heart upon all that I shall shew thee: for thou art brought hither that they may be shewn to thee: declare all that thou seest, to the house of Israel.
<br>5	And behold there was a wall on the out- side of the house round about, and in the man’s hand a measuring reed of six cubits and a hand- breadth: and he measured the breadth of the building one reed, and the height one reed.
<br>6	And he came to the gate that looked toward the east, and he went up the steps thereof: and he measured the breadth of the threshold of the gate one reed, that is, one threshold was one reed broad;
<br>7	And every little chamber was one reed long, and one reed broad: and between the little cham- bers were five cubits:
<br>8	And the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within, was one reed.
<br>9	And he measured the porch of the gate eight cubits, and the front thereof two cubits: and the porch of the gate was inward.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>10	And the little chambers of the gate that looked eastward were three on this side, and three on that side: all three were of one measure, and the fronts of one measure, on both parts.
<br>11	And he measured the breadth of the thresh- old of the gate ten cubits: and the length of the gate thirteen cubits:
<br>12	And the border before the little chambers one cubit: and one cubit was the border on both sides: and the little chambers were six cubits on this side and that side.
<br>13	And he measured the gate from the roof of one little chamber to the roof of another, in breadth five and twenty cubits: door against door.
<br>14	He made also fronts of sixty cubits: and to the front the court of the gate on every side round about.
<br>15	And before the face of the gate which reached even to the face of the porch of the inner gate, fifty cubits.
<br>16	And slanting windows in the little cham- bers, and in their fronts, which were within the gate on every side round about: and in like man- ner there were also in the porches windows round about within, and before the fronts the represen- tation of palm trees.
<br>17	And he brought me into the outward court, and behold there were chambers, and a pavement of stone in the court round about: thirty cham- bers encompassed the pavement.
<br>18	And the pavement in the front of the gates according to the length of the gates was lower.
<br>19	And he measured the breadth from the face of the lower gate to the front of the inner court without, a hundred cubits to the east, and to the north.
<br>20	He measured also both the length and the breadth of the gate of the outward court, which looked northward.
<br> 
<br>21	And the little chambers thereof three on this side, and three on that side: and the front thereof, and the porch thereof according to the measure of the former gate, fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.
<br>22	And the windows thereof, and the porch, and the gravings according to the measure of the gate that looked to the east, and they went up to it by seven steps, and a porch was before it.
<br>23	And the gate of the inner court was over against the gate of the north, and that of the east: and he measured from gate to gate a hun- dred cubits.
<br>24	And he brought me out to the way of the south, and behold the gate that looked to the south: and he measured the front thereof, and the porch thereof according to the former mea- sures.
<br>25	And the windows thereof, and the porches round about, as the other windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.
<br>26	And there were seven steps to go up to it: and a porch before the doors thereof: and there were graven palm trees, one on this side, and another on that side in the front thereof.
<br>27	And there was a gate of the inner court towards the south: and he measured from gate to gate towards the south, a hundred cubits.
<br>28	And he brought me into the inner court at the south gate: and he measured the gate according to the former measures.
<br>29	The little chamber thereof, and the front thereof, and the porch thereof with the same measures: and the windows thereof, and the porch thereof round about it was fifty cubits in length, and five and twenty cubits in breadth.
<br>30	And the porch round about was five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits broad.
<br>31	And the porch thereof to the outward
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>court, and the palm trees thereof in the front: and there were eight steps to go up to it.
<br>32	And he brought me into the inner court by the way of the east: and he measured the gate according to the former measures.
<br>33	The little chamber thereof, and the front thereof, and the porch thereof as before: and the windows thereof, and the porches thereof round about it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.
<br>34	And the porch thereof, that is, of the out- ward court: and the graven palm trees in the front thereof on this side and on that side: and the going up thereof was by eight steps.
<br>35	And he brought me into the gate that looked to the north: and he measured accord- ing to the former measures.
<br>36	The little chamber thereof, and the front thereof, and the porch thereof, and the windows thereof round about it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.
<br>37	And the porch thereof looked to the out- ward court: and the graving of palm trees in the front thereof was on this side and on that side: and the going up to it was by eight steps.
<br>38	And at every chamber was a door in the forefronts of the gates: there they washed the holocaust.
<br>39	And in the porch of the gate were two ta- bles on this side, and two tables on that side: that the holocaust, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering might be slain thereon.
<br>40	And on the outward side, which goeth up to the entry of the gate that looketh toward the north, were two tables: and at the other side before the porch of the gate were two tables,
<br>41	Four tables were on this side, and four ta- bles on that side at the sides of the gate were eight tables, upon which they slew the victims.
