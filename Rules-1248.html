<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13317. Volunteers for Prosperity
<br>
<br>Ex. Ord. No. 13317, Sept. 25, 2003, 68 F.R. 56515, as amended by Ex. Ord. No. 13418, Dec. 14, 2006, 71 F.R. 75647, provided:
<br>
<br>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to encourage volunteer service by highly skilled Americans to support major initiatives by the United States for promoting health and prosperity around the world, it is hereby ordered as follows:
<br>
<br>Section 1. (a) Policy. A part of USA Freedom Corps, "Volunteers for Prosperity" is a call to service to support major U.S. initiatives that promote health and prosperity around the world. Deploying highly skilled volunteers abroad is an efficient way to use our resources consistent with the objectives of the United States Government's global prosperity agenda. United States volunteers will help to achieve the objectives of the global prosperity agenda, including providing clean water to the poor, promoting democratic governance, developing economic freedom, promoting free and open markets, stemming the spread of HIV/AIDS and controlling malaria.
<br>
<br>The investment of Federal resources to enable U.S. volunteers to work with nongovernmental and voluntary service organizations overseas is a preferred use of our resources and also will help leverage private sector resources. United States citizens who are skilled professionals and who volunteer, when matched with organizations working on specific U.S. prosperity initiatives overseas, can provide invaluable support for these initiatives and will supplement and complement the traditions and accomplishments of the Peace Corps.
<br>
<br>United States prosperity initiatives that can benefit from volunteer service include, but are not limited to, the Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the Digital Freedom Initiative, the Water for the Poor Initiative, the Trade for African Development and Enterprise Initiative, the Middle East Partnership Initiative, and the President's Malaria Initiative.
<br>
<br>Volunteer service in support of other initiatives, consistent with U.S. foreign policy, shall be considered as well.
<br>
<br>(b) Applicability. The following agencies are subject to the requirements of this order: the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Department of State, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Health and Human Services, and such other Federal agencies as the President may designate in the future.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. Establishment. (a) Agencies subject to this order shall each establish within their respective organizations an Office for Volunteers for Prosperity (Office) or, as appropriate, an operating unit within an office.
<br>
<br>(b) Each agency subject to this order shall provide its Office or unit with appropriate staff, administrative support, and resources to meet its responsibilities under this order.
<br>
<br>(c) Each of these Offices or units shall begin operations no later than 30 days from the date of this order.
<br>
<br>(d) Agencies subject to this order shall consider, in evaluating grant applications for assistance activities to be implemented abroad, the applicant's use of highly skilled U.S. volunteers to support U.S. prosperity objectives and initiatives.
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. Purpose. To the extent permitted by law, the purpose of the Offices will be to promote, expand, and enhance well-defined volunteer service opportunities for highly skilled U.S. professionals who wish to work with nongovernmental and voluntary service organizations around the world in support of major U.S. prosperity initiatives as identified in section 1 of this order. Such promotion, expansion, and enhancement would include actively participating in the design and selection processes for grants within their agencies, tracking the use of U.S. private volunteer organizations by their agencies, and coordinating with White House Offices including the USA Freedom Corps, the Office of National AIDS Policy, and the Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives, as appropriate.
<br>
<br>Sec. 4. Funding. Agencies subject to this order are hereby directed to use their best efforts to use funds available for the U.S. prosperity initiatives listed in section 1 of this order to provide appropriate support to organizations that use highly skilled U.S. volunteers to accomplish the objectives identified in those initiatives.
<br>
<br>Sec. 5. Coordination. The USAID shall serve as the inter-agency coordinator for the Volunteers for Prosperity initiative. In that capacity, the USAID shall coordinate the activities that fall within the scope of the initiative and report on the progress of the initiative to the USA Freedom Corps Office, within the White House Office. The reports shall be submitted within 180 days after the date of this order and annually thereafter. The USA Freedom Corps Council shall encourage consistency in policies and practices within the agencies subject to this order, as appropriate, for purposes related to the Volunteers for Prosperity initiative.
<br>
<br>Sec. 6. Administration. The actions directed by this order shall be carried out subject to the availability of appropriations, to the extent permitted by law, and consistent with the agencies' missions.
<br>
<br>Sec. 7. Judicial Review. This order is intended only to improve the internal management of the executive branch of the Federal Government, and it is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity, against the United States, its departments, agencies, or other entities, its officers or employees, or any other person.

<br>§8402. Findings
<br>
<br>Congress finds the following:
<br>
<br>(1) The people of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the United States share a long history of friendship and comity, and the interests of both nations are well-served by strengthening and deepening this friendship.
<br>
<br>(2) Since 2001, the United States has contributed more than $15,000,000,000 to Pakistan, of which more than $10,000,000,000 has been security-related assistance and direct payments.
<br>
<br>(3) With the free and fair election of February 18, 2008, Pakistan returned to civilian rule, reversing years of political tension and mounting popular concern over military rule and Pakistan's own democratic reform and political development.
<br>
<br>(4) Pakistan is a major non-NATO ally of the United States and has been a valuable partner in the battle against al Qaeda and the Taliban, but much more remains to be accomplished by both nations.
<br>
<br>(5) The struggle against al Qaeda, the Taliban, and affiliated terrorist groups has led to the deaths of several thousand Pakistani civilians and members of the security forces of Pakistan over the past seven years.
<br>
<br>(6) Despite killing or capturing hundreds of al Qaeda operatives and other terrorists—including major al Qaeda leaders, such as Khalid Sheikh Muhammad, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, and Abu Faraj al-Libi—the FATA, parts of the NWFP, Quetta in Balochistan, and Muridke in Punjab remain a sanctuary for al Qaeda, the Afghan Taliban, the Terikh-e Taliban and affiliated groups from which these groups organize terrorist actions against Pakistan and other countries.
<br>
<br>(7) The security forces of Pakistan have struggled to contain a Taliban-backed insurgency, recently taking direct action against those who threaten Pakistan's security and stability, including military operations in the FATA and the NWFP.
<br>
<br>(8) On March 27, 2009, President Obama noted, "Multiple intelligence estimates have warned that al Qaeda is actively planning attacks on the United States homeland from its safe-haven in Pakistan.".
<br>
<br>(9) According to a Government Accountability Office report (GAO–08–622), "since 2003, the [A]dministration's national security strategies and Congress have recognized that a comprehensive plan that includes all elements of national power—diplomatic, military, intelligence, development assistance, economic, and law enforcement support—was needed to address the terrorist threat emanating from the FATA" and that such a strategy was also mandated by section 7102(b)(3) of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (Public Law 108–458; 22 U.S.C. 2656f note) and section 2042(b)(2) of the Implementing the 1 Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (Public Law 110–53; 22 U.S.C. 2375 note).
<br>
<br>(10) During 2008 and 2009, the people of Pakistan have been especially hard hit by rising food and commodity prices and severe energy shortages, with 2/3 of the population living on less than $2 a day and 1/5 of the population living below the poverty line according to the United Nations Development Program.
<br>
<br>(11) Economic growth is a fundamental foundation for human security and national stability in Pakistan, a country with more than 175,000,000 people, an annual population growth rate of two percent, and a ranking of 136 out of 177 countries in the United Nations Human Development Index.
<br>
<br>(12) The 2009 Pakistani military offensive in the NWFP and the FATA displaced millions of residents in one of the gravest humanitarian crises Pakistan has faced, and despite the heroic efforts of Pakistanis to respond to the needs of the displaced millions and facilitate the return of many, it has highlighted the need for Pakistan to develop an effective national counterinsurgency strategy.
<br>
<br>(Pub. L. 111–73, §3, Oct. 15, 2009, 123 Stat. 2061.)
<br>
<br>1 So in original. The word "the" probably should not appear.
<br>§8403. Statement of principles
<br>
<br>Congress declares that the relationship between the United States and Pakistan should be based on the following principles:
<br>
<br>(1) Pakistan is a critical friend and ally to the United States, both in times of strife and in times of peace, and the two countries share many common goals, including combating terrorism and violent radicalism, solidifying democracy and rule of law in Pakistan, and promoting the social and economic development of Pakistan.
<br>
<br>(2) United States assistance to Pakistan is intended to supplement, not supplant, Pakistan's own efforts in building a stable, secure, and prosperous Pakistan.
<br>
<br>(3) The United States requires a balanced, integrated, countrywide strategy for Pakistan that provides assistance throughout the country and does not disproportionately focus on security-related assistance or one particular area or province.
<br>
<br>(4) The United States supports Pakistan's struggle against extremist elements and recognizes the profound sacrifice made by Pakistan in the fight against terrorism, including the loss of more than 1,900 soldiers and police since 2001 in combat with al Qaeda, the Taliban, and other extremist and terrorist groups.
<br>
<br>(5) The United States intends to work with the Government of Pakistan—
<br>
<br>(A) to build mutual trust and confidence by actively and consistently pursuing a sustained, long-term, multifaceted relationship between the two countries, devoted to strengthening the mutual security, stability, and prosperity of both countries;
<br>
<br>(B) to support the people of Pakistan and their democratic government in their efforts to consolidate democracy, including strengthening Pakistan's parliament, helping Pakistan reestablish an independent and transparent judicial system, and working to extend the rule of law in all areas in Pakistan;
<br>
<br>(C) to promote sustainable long-term development and infrastructure projects, including in healthcare, education, water management, and energy programs, in all areas of Pakistan, that are sustained and supported by each successive democratic government in Pakistan;
<br>
<br>(D) to ensure that all the people of Pakistan, including those living in areas governed by the Frontier Crimes Regulation, have access to public, modernized education and vocational training to enable them to provide for themselves, for their families, and for a more prosperous future for their children;
<br>
<br>(E) to support the strengthening of core curricula and the quality of schools across Pakistan, including madrassas, in order to improve the prospects for Pakistani children's futures and eliminate incitements to violence and intolerance;
<br>
<br>(F) to encourage and promote public-private partnerships in Pakistan in order to bolster ongoing development efforts and strengthen economic prospects, especially with respect to opportunities to build civic responsibility and professional skills of the people of Pakistan, including support for institutions of higher learning with international accreditation;
<br>
<br>(G) to expand people-to-people engagement between the two countries, through increased educational, technical, and cultural exchanges and other methods;
<br>
<br>(H) to encourage the development of local analytical capacity to measure program effectiveness and progress on an integrated basis, especially across the areas of United States assistance and payments to Pakistan, and increase accountability for how such assistance and payments are being spent;
<br>
<br>(I) to assist Pakistan's efforts to improve counterterrorism financing and anti-money laundering regulatory structure in order to achieve international standards and encourage Pakistan to apply for "Financial Action Task Force" observer status and adhere to the United Nations International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism;
<br>
<br>(J) to strengthen Pakistan's counterinsurgency and counterterrorism strategy to help prevent any territory of Pakistan from being used as a base or conduit for terrorist attacks in Pakistan or elsewhere;
<br>
<br>(K) to strengthen Pakistan's efforts to develop strong and effective law enforcement and national defense forces under civilian leadership;
<br>
<br>(L) to achieve full cooperation in matters of counter-proliferation of nuclear materials and related networks;
<br>
<br>(M) to strengthen Pakistan's efforts to gain control of its under-governed areas and address the threat posed by any person or group that conducts violence, sabotage, or other terrorist activities in Pakistan or its neighboring countries; and
<br>
<br>(N) to explore means to consult with and utilize the relevant expertise and skills of the Pakistani-American community.
<br>

<br>Statutory Notes and Related Subsidiaries
<br>Malala Yousafzai Scholarship
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 116–338, Jan. 13, 2021, 134 Stat. 5122, provided that:
<br>"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
<br>
<br>"This Act may be cited as the 'Malala Yousafzai Scholarship Act'."
<br>"SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
<br>
<br>"Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>"(1) In late 2008, Malala Yousafzai began making the case for access to education for women and girls despite objections from the Pakistani Taliban. On October 9, 2012, Malala was shot in the head by Pakistani Taliban on her way home from school.
<br>
<br>"(2) In 2013, Malala Yousafzai and her father Ziauddin Yousafzai co-founded the Malala Fund. The Malala Fund works to secure 12 years of free, safe, and quality education for all girls. Completion of a full 12-year cycle of primary and secondary education ensures a pipeline of girls able to pursue higher education.
<br>
<br>"(3) On July 12, 2013, Malala delivered a speech before the United Nations General Assembly calling for expanded access to education for women and girls across the globe. She said, '[L]et us wage a glorious struggle against illiteracy, poverty, and terrorism. Let us pick up our books and our pens. They are the most powerful weapons * * *. Education is the only solution.'.
<br>
<br>"(4) On October 10, 2014, Malala Yousafzai became the co-recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize for her 'struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education'.
<br>
<br>"(5) According to the United Nations 2016 Global Education Monitoring Report, more than 130 million girls worldwide are out of school. 15 million girls of primary-school age will never enter a classroom. As of 2016, at least 500 million adult women across the globe are illiterate.
<br>
<br>"(6) According to the World Bank, 'Girls' education is a strategic development priority. Better educated women tend to be healthier, participate more in the formal labor market, earn higher incomes, * * * marry at a later age, and enable better health care and education for their children, should they choose to become mothers. All these factors combined can help lift households, communities, and nations out of poverty.'.
<br>
<br>"(7) In 2015, all United Nations Member States, including the United States, adopted quality education, including access to higher education, and gender equality as sustainable development goals to be attained by 2030. One of the education goal targets is to 'ensure equal access for all women and men to affordable and quality technical, vocational and tertiary education, including university'.
<br>
<br>"(8) In January 2010, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton stated, 'We will open the doors of education to all citizens, but especially to girls and women * * *. We are doing all of these things because we have seen that when women and girls have the tools to stay healthy and the opportunity to contribute to their families' well-being, they flourish and so do the people around them.[']
<br>
<br>"(9) In February 2019, the White House launched the Women's Global Development and Prosperity Initiative to advance women's economic empowerment across the globe and reach more than 100,000 women.
<br>
<br>"(10) The World Economic Forum ranks Pakistan the second lowest among all countries in the world evaluated for gender equality. On educational attainment for women, Pakistan is ranked the tenth lowest.
<br>
<br>"(11) In Pakistan, the rate of higher education enrollment beyond high school for girls and women is just 9 percent as reported by the World Bank. The global rate is 40 percent. Less than 6 percent of women 25 and older in Pakistan attain a bachelor's degree or equivalent as of 2016.
<br>
<br>"(12) Factors such as poverty, early marriage, disability, ethnicity, and religion can contribute to the lack of educational opportunities for women in marginalized communities.
<br>
<br>"(13) According to the World Bank, 'Higher education benefits both individuals and society. Economic returns for college graduates are the highest in the entire educational system—an average 17 percent increase in earnings per year of schooling as compared with 10 percent for primary school.'.
<br>
<br>"(14) The United States provides critical foreign assistance to Pakistan's education sector to improve access to and the quality of basic and higher education. Since 2010, the United States Agency for International Development (referred to in this Act as 'USAID') has awarded more than 6,000 scholarships for young women to receive higher education in Pakistan.
<br>
<br>"(15) The Merit and Needs-Based Scholarship Program administered by USAID awards scholarships to academically talented, financially needy Pakistani students from all regions, including female students from rural areas of the country, to pursue bachelor's or master's degrees at participating Pakistani universities.
<br>"SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.
<br>
<br>"(a) In General.—It is the sense of Congress that—
<br>
<br>"(1) every individual should have the opportunity to pursue a full cycle of primary, secondary, and higher education;
<br>
<br>"(2) every individual, regardless of gender, socio-economic status, ethnicity, or religion should have the opportunity to pursue an education without fear of discrimination;
<br>
<br>"(3) educational exchanges promote institutional linkages between the United States and Pakistan; and
<br>
<br>"(4) recipients of scholarships referred to in section 4 should commit to improving their local communities.
<br>
<br>"(b) Continued Support for Educational Initiatives in Pakistan.—Congress encourages the Department of State and USAID to continue their support for initiatives led by the Government of Pakistan and civil society that promote education in Pakistan, especially education for women, in accordance with USAID's 2018 Education Policy.
<br>"SEC. 4. MERIT AND NEEDS-BASED SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM.
<br>
<br>"(a) In General.—The USAID Administrator shall award at least 50 percent of the number of scholarships under the Merit and Needs-Based Scholarship Program (referred to in this Act as the 'Program') to women for each of the calendar years 2020 through 2022.
<br>
<br>"(b) Limitations.—
<br>
<br>"(1) Criteria.—The scholarships available under subsection (a) may only be awarded in accordance with other scholarship eligibility criteria already established by USAID.
<br>
<br>"(2) Academic disciplines.—Scholarships authorized under subsection (a) shall be awarded for a range of disciplines to improve the employability of graduates and to meet the needs of the scholarship recipients.
<br>
<br>"(3) Other scholarships.—The USAID Administrator shall make every effort to award 50 percent of the scholarships available under the Program to Pakistani women.
<br>
<br>"(c) Leveraging Investment.—The USAID Administrator shall, to the greatest extent practicable, consult with and leverage investments by the Pakistani private sector and Pakistani diaspora communities in the United States as part of USAID's greater effort to improve the quality of, expand access to, and ensure sustainability of education programs in Pakistan.
<br>"SEC. 5. ANNUAL CONGRESSIONAL BRIEFING.
<br>
<br>"(a) In General.—The USAID Administrator shall designate appropriate USAID officials to brief the appropriate congressional committees, not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act [Jan. 13, 2021], and annually thereafter for the next 3 years, on the implementation of section 4.
<br>
<br>"(b) Contents.—The briefing described in subsection (a) shall include, among other relevant information, for the most recently concluded fiscal year—
<br>
<br>"(1) the total number of scholarships that were awarded through the Program, including a breakdown by gender;
<br>
<br>"(2) the disciplines of study chosen by the scholarship recipients;
<br>
<br>"(3) the percentage of the scholarships that were awarded to students seeking a bachelor's degree or a master's degree, respectively;
<br>
<br>"(4) the percentage of scholarship recipients who voluntarily dropped out of school or were involuntarily pushed out of the program for failure to meet program requirements; and
<br>
<br>"(5) the percentage of scholarship recipients who dropped out of school due to retaliation for seeking an education, to the extent that such information is available."
