<br>
<br>(1) shall be tried in the district in which such offense was committed; or

<br>
<br>"(1) the district at which the person enters the United States; or

<br>§70505. Failure to comply with international law as a defense
<br>
<br>A person charged with violating section 70503 of this title, or against whom a civil enforcement proceeding is brought under section 70508, does not have standing to raise a claim of failure to comply with international law as a basis for a defense. A claim of failure to comply with international law in the enforcement of this chapter may be made only by a foreign nation. A failure to comply with international law does not divest a court of jurisdiction and is not a defense to a proceeding under this chapter.

<br>
<br>(a) In General.—Property described in section 511(a) of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 881(a)) that is used or intended for use to commit, or to facilitate the commission of, an offense under section 70503 or 70508 of this title may be seized and forfeited in the same manner that similar property may be seized and forfeited under section 511 of that Act (21 U.S.C. 881).
<br>
<br>(b) Prima Facie Evidence of Violation.—Practices commonly recognized as smuggling tactics may provide prima facie evidence of intent to use a vessel to commit, or to facilitate the commission of, an offense under section 70503 of this title, and may support seizure and forfeiture of the vessel, even in the absence of controlled substances aboard the vessel. The following indicia, among others, may be considered, in the totality of the circumstances, to be prima facie evidence that a vessel is intended to be used to commit, or to facilitate the commission of, such an offense:
<br>
<br>(1) The construction or adaptation of the vessel in a manner that facilitates smuggling, including—
<br>
<br>(A) the configuration of the vessel to ride low in the water or present a low hull profile to avoid being detected visually or by radar;
<br>
<br>(B) the presence of any compartment or equipment that is built or fitted out for smuggling, not including items such as a safe or lock-box reasonably used for the storage of personal valuables;
<br>
<br>(C) the presence of an auxiliary tank not installed in accordance with applicable law or installed in such a manner as to enhance the vessel's smuggling capability;
<br>
<br>(D) the presence of engines that are excessively over-powered in relation to the design and size of the vessel;
<br>
<br>(E) the presence of materials used to reduce or alter the heat or radar signature of the vessel and avoid detection;
<br>
<br>(F) the presence of a camouflaging paint scheme, or of materials used to camouflage the vessel, to avoid detection; or
<br>
<br>(G) the display of false vessel registration numbers, false indicia of vessel nationality, false vessel name, or false vessel homeport.
<br>
<br>(2) The presence or absence of equipment, personnel, or cargo inconsistent with the type or declared purpose of the vessel.
<br>
<br>(3) The presence of excessive fuel, lube oil, food, water, or spare parts, inconsistent with legitimate vessel operation, inconsistent with the construction or equipment of the vessel, or inconsistent with the character of the vessel's stated purpose.
<br>
<br>(4) The operation of the vessel without lights during times lights are required to be displayed under applicable law or regulation and in a manner of navigation consistent with smuggling tactics used to avoid detection by law enforcement authorities.
<br>
<br>(5) The failure of the vessel to stop or respond or heave to when hailed by government authority, especially where the vessel conducts evasive maneuvering when hailed.
<br>
<br>(6) The declaration to government authority of apparently false information about the vessel, crew, or voyage or the failure to identify the vessel by name or country of registration when requested to do so by government authority.
<br>
<br>(7) The presence of controlled substance residue on the vessel, on an item aboard the vessel, or on an individual aboard the vessel, of a quantity or other nature that reasonably indicates manufacturing or distribution activity.
<br>
<br>(8) The use of petroleum products or other substances on the vessel to foil the detection of controlled substance residue.
<br>
<br>(9) The presence of a controlled substance in the water in the vicinity of the vessel, where given the currents, weather conditions, and course and speed of the vessel, the quantity or other nature is such that it reasonably indicates manufacturing or distribution activity.

<br>
<br>(c) Defenses.—
<br>

<br>

<br>
<br>(b) When Suitable Vessel Not Available.—The Secretary of Homeland Security may authorize a foreign vessel to engage in salvaging operations in a particular locality if, on investigation, the Secretary is satisfied that there is not available in that locality a suitable vessel that is—

<br>(c) Time Limit on Bringing Actions.—A civil action to recover remuneration for giving aid or salvage services must be brought within 2 years after the date the aid or salvage services were given, unless the court in which the action is brought is satisfied that during that 2-year period there had not been a reasonable opportunity to seize the aided or salvaged vessel within the jurisdiction of the court or within the territorial waters of the country of the plaintiff's residence or principal place of business.

<br>
<br>In this chapter:
<br>
<br>(1) Container.—The term "container" has the meaning given that term in the Convention.
<br>
<br>(2) Convention.—The term "Convention" means the International Convention for Safe Containers, and its annexes, done at Geneva, Switzerland, December 2, 1972.
<br>
<br>(3) International transport.—The term "international transport" means the transportation of a container between—
<br>
<br>(A) a place in a foreign country and a place in the jurisdiction of the United States; or
<br>
<br>(B) two places outside the United States by United States carriers.
<br>
<br>(4) Owner.—The term "owner" includes the lessee or bailee of a container if a written lease or bailment provides for the lessee or bailee to exercise the owner's responsibility for maintaining and examining the container.

<br>
<br>In the definition of "international transport", subparagraphs (A) and (B) are substituted for 46 App. U.S.C. 1501(d)(1)–(3) to eliminate unnecessary words.
<br>
<br>In the definition of "owner", the words "includes the lessee or bailee of a container if a written lease or bailment provides for the lessee or bailee to exercise the owner's responsibility for maintaining and examining the container" are substituted for "means a person who owns a container, or, if a written lease or bailment provides for the lessee or bailee to exercise the owner's responsibility for maintaining and examining the container, the lessee or bailee of a container, to the extent such agreement so provides" to eliminate unnecessary words.
<br>
<br>The definition of "Secretary" is omitted because a complete reference to the appropriate Secretary is used the first time the Secretary is named in each section. Throughout this chapter, the phrase "Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating" is substituted for "Secretary of Transportation" because the Coast Guard has been transferred to the Department of Homeland Security (except when operating as a service in the Navy) by section 888 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Pub. L. 107–296, 116 Stat. 2249).

<br>§80502. Application of Convention
<br>
<br>The Convention applies to an owner of a container used in international transport if the owner is domiciled or has its principal office in the United States.

<br>(3) provide a method for developing, collecting, and disseminating information about container safety and the international transport of containers.
<br>
<br>(c) Safety Approval Plates.—If the owner of a container without a safety approval plate establishes that the container satisfies the standards of the Convention, the Secretary may authorize a safety approval plate to be attached to the container.
<br>

<br>
<br>(e) Encouraging Intermodal Transport.—To the maximum extent possible, the Secretary shall encourage the development and use of intermodal transport, using containers built to facilitate economical, safe, and expeditious handling of containerized cargo without intermediate reloading when it is being transported over land, air, and sea areas.

<br>(A) does not have a safety approval plate attached to it; or
<br>
<br>(B) has a safety approval plate attached but there is significant evidence that the container is in a condition that creates an obvious risk to safety;
