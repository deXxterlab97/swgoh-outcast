<br>(c) Rights of defendants

<br>
<br>Subsec. (a)(6). Pub. L. 111–211, §234(a)(2)(A), inserted "(except as provided in subsection (b))" after "assistance of counsel for his defense". Amendment was executed to reflect the probable intent of Congress, notwithstanding errors in the directory language in quoting the text to be inserted.
<br>
<br>Subsec. (a)(7). Pub. L. 111–211, §234(a)(2)(B), added par. (7) and struck out former par. (7) which read as follows: "require excessive bail, impose excessive fines, inflict cruel and unusual punishments, and in no event impose for conviction of any one offense any penalty or punishment greater than imprisonment for a term of one year and a fine of $5,000, or both;".
<br>

<br>The term "domestic violence" means violence committed by a current or former spouse or intimate partner of the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the victim as a spouse or intimate partner, or by a person similarly situated to a spouse of the victim under the domestic- or family- violence laws of an Indian tribe that has jurisdiction over the Indian country where the violence occurs.
<br>(3) Indian country
<br>
<br>The term "Indian country" has the meaning given the term in section 1151 of title 18.
<br>(4) Participating tribe

<br>(6) Special domestic violence criminal jurisdiction
<br>
<br>The term "special domestic violence criminal jurisdiction" means the criminal jurisdiction that a participating tribe may exercise under this section but could not otherwise exercise.

<br>
<br>The term "spouse or intimate partner" has the meaning given the term in section 2266 of title 18.
<br>(b) Nature of the criminal jurisdiction
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in addition to all powers of self-government recognized and affirmed by sections 1301 and 1303 of this title, the powers of self-government of a participating tribe include the inherent power of that tribe, which is hereby recognized and affirmed, to exercise special domestic violence criminal jurisdiction over all persons.
<br>(2) Concurrent jurisdiction
<br>
<br>The exercise of special domestic violence criminal jurisdiction by a participating tribe shall be concurrent with the jurisdiction of the United States, of a State, or of both.
<br>(3) Applicability
<br>
<br>Nothing in this section—
<br>
<br>(A) creates or eliminates any Federal or State criminal jurisdiction over Indian country; or
<br>
<br>(B) affects the authority of the United States or any State government that has been delegated authority by the United States to investigate and prosecute a criminal violation in Indian country.
<br>(4) Exceptions
<br>(A) Victim and defendant are both non-Indians
<br>(i) In general
<br>
<br>A participating tribe may not exercise special domestic violence criminal jurisdiction over an alleged offense if neither the defendant nor the alleged victim is an Indian.
<br>(ii) Definition of victim
<br>
<br>In this subparagraph and with respect to a criminal proceeding in which a participating tribe exercises special domestic violence criminal jurisdiction based on a violation of a protection order, the term "victim" means a person specifically protected by a protection order that the defendant allegedly violated.
<br>(B) Defendant lacks ties to the Indian tribe
<br>
<br>A participating tribe may exercise special domestic violence criminal jurisdiction over a defendant only if the defendant—
<br>
<br>(i) resides in the Indian country of the participating tribe;

<br>(ii) is employed in the Indian country of the participating tribe; or
<br>
<br>(iii) is a spouse, intimate partner, or dating partner of—

<br>
<br>(ii) was issued against the defendant;
<br>
<br>(iii) is enforceable by the participating tribe; and
<br>
<br>(iv) is consistent with section 2265(b) of title 18.

<br>
<br>(1) all applicable rights under this Act;
<br>
<br>(2) if a term of imprisonment of any length may be imposed, all rights described in section 1302(c) of this title;
<br>
<br>(3) the right to a trial by an impartial jury that is drawn from sources that—
<br>
<br>(A) reflect a fair cross section of the community; and
<br>
<br>(B) do not systematically exclude any distinctive group in the community, including non-Indians; and
<br>
<br>(4) all other rights whose protection is necessary under the Constitution of the United States in order for Congress to recognize and affirm the inherent power of the participating tribe to exercise special domestic violence criminal jurisdiction over the defendant.
<br>(e) Petitions to stay detention
<br>(1) In general
<br>
<br>A person who has filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in a court of the United States under section 1303 of this title may petition that court to stay further detention of that person by the participating tribe.
<br>(2) Grant of stay
<br>
<br>A court shall grant a stay described in paragraph (1) if the court—
<br>
<br>(A) finds that there is a substantial likelihood that the habeas corpus petition will be granted; and
<br>
<br>(B) after giving each alleged victim in the matter an opportunity to be heard, finds by clear and convincing evidence that under conditions imposed by the court, the petitioner is not likely to flee or pose a danger to any person or the community if released.
<br>(3) Notice
<br>
<br>An Indian tribe that has ordered the detention of any person has a duty to timely notify such person of his rights and privileges under this subsection and under section 1303 of this title.

<br>§1403. Preparation of plan
<br>(a) Prerequisites for final preparation
<br>
<br>The Secretary shall prepare a plan which shall best serve the interests of all those entities and individuals entitled to receive funds of each Indian judgment. Prior to the final preparation of the plan, the Secretary shall—
<br>
<br>(1) receive and consider any resolution or communication, together with any suggested use or distribution plan, which any affected Indian tribe may wish to submit to him; and
<br>
<br>(2) hold a hearing of record, after appropriate public notice, to obtain the testimony of leaders and members of the Indian tribe which may receive any portion, or be affected by the use or distribution, of such funds, in the area in which such Indian tribe is located and at a time which shall best serve the convenience of the eligible members thereof.
<br>(b) Guidelines
<br>
<br>In preparing a plan for the use or distribution of the funds of each Indian judgment, the Secretary shall, among other things, be assured that—
<br>
<br>(1) legal, financial, and other expertise of the Department of the Interior has been made fully available in an advisory capacity to the Indian tribe which is entitled to such funds to assist it to develop and communicate to the Secretary pursuant to clause (1) of subsection (a) of this section its own suggested plan for the distribution and use of such funds;
<br>
<br>(2) the needs and desires of any groups or individuals who are in a minority position, but who are also entitled to receive such funds, have been fully ascertained and considered;
<br>
<br>(3) the interests of minors and other legally incompetent persons who are entitled to receive any portion of such funds as are subsequently distributed to them are and will be protected and preserved; 1 Provided, That such funds may be disbursed to the parents or legal guardian of such minors or legal incompetents in such amounts as may be necessary for the minor or legal incompetent's health, education, welfare, or emergencies under a plan or plans approved by the Secretary and the tribal governing body of the Indian tribe involved.2
<br>
<br>(4) any provision, including enrollment provisions, of the constitution, bylaws, rules, and procedures of such tribe which may affect the distribution or other use of such funds are in full accord with the principles of fairness and equity;
<br>
<br>(5) a significant portion of such funds shall be set aside and programed to serve common tribal needs, educational requirements, and such other purposes as the circumstances of the affected Indian tribe may justify, except not less than 20 per centum of such funds shall be so set aside and programed unless the Secretary determines that the particular circumstances of the pertinent Indian tribe clearly warrant otherwise: Provided, That in the development of such plan the Secretary shall survey past and present plans of the tribe for economic development, shall consider long range benefits which might accrue to the tribe from such plans, and shall encourage programing of funds for economic development purposes where appropriate; and
<br>
<br>(6) methods exist and will be employed to insure the proper performance of the plan once it becomes effective under section 1405 of this title.
