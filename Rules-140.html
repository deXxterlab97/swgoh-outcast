<br>Historical and Revision Notes
<br>
<br>The section is supplied to avoid the necessity for defining "independent establishment" each time it is used in this title.
<br>
<br>Certain agencies are not independent establishments under the definition since they are constituent agencies or parts of an independent establishment. However, these agencies would continue to be subject to the provisions of this title applicable to the independent establishment of which they are a constituent or part. Also, the definition does not expand or abridge any rights or authority possessed by these agencies as no substantive changes are intended, see section 7(a) of the bill.

<br>
<br>Aug. 12, 1958, Pub. L. 85–619, 72 Stat. 547.
<br>
<br>The words "Executive department" are substituted for "department" as the definition of "department" applicable to this section is coextensive with the definition of "Executive department" in section 101. The words "not inconsistent with law" are omitted as surplusage as a regulation which is inconsistent with law is invalid.
<br>
<br>The words "or military department" are inserted to preserve the application of the source law. Before enactment of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (63 Stat. 578), the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force were Executive departments. The National Security Act Amendments of 1949 established the Department of Defense as an Executive Department including the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force as military departments, not as Executive departments. However, the source law for this section, which was in effect in 1949, remained applicable to the Secretaries of the military departments by virtue of section 12(g) of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (63 Stat. 591), which provided:
<br>
<br>"All laws, orders, regulations, and other actions relating to the National Military Establishment, the Departments of the Army, the Navy, or the Air Force, or to any officer or activity of such establishment or such departments, shall, except to the extent inconsistent with the provisions of this Act, have the same effect as if this Act had not been enacted; but, after the effective date of this Act, any such law, order, regulation, or other action which vested functions in or otherwise related to any officer, department, or establishment, shall be deemed to have vested such function in or relate to the officer, or department, executive or military, succeeding the officer, department, or establishment in which such function was vested. For purposes of this subsection the Department of Defense shall be deemed the department succeeding the National Military Establishment, and the military departments of Army, Navy, and Air Force shall be deemed the departments succeeding the Executive Departments of Army, Navy, and Air Force."
<br>
<br>This section was part of title IV of the Revised Statutes. The Act of July 26, 1947, ch. 343, §201(d), as added Aug. 10, 1949, ch. 412, §4, 63 Stat. 579 (former 5 U.S.C. 171–1), which provides "Except to the extent inconsistent with the provisions of this Act [National Security Act of 1947], the provisions of title IV of the Revised Statutes as now or hereafter amended shall be applicable to the Department of Defense" is omitted from this title but is not repealed.
<br>
<br>Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.

The words "Executive department" are substituted for "departments" as the definition of "department" applicable to this section is coextensive with the definition of "Executive department" in section 101. So much as related to the Armed Forces is omitted as superseded by section 636 of title 14 and section 936(b) of title 10.

<br>§304. Subpenas
<br>
<br>(a) The head of an Executive department or military department or bureau thereof in which a claim against the United States is pending may apply to a judge or clerk of a court of the United States to issue a subpena for a witness within the jurisdiction of the court to appear at a time and place stated in the subpena before an individual authorized to take depositions to be used in the courts of the United States, to give full and true answers to such written interrogatories and cross-interrogatories as may be submitted with the application, or to be orally examined and cross-examined on the subject of the claim.
<br>
<br>(b) If a witness, after being served with a subpena, neglects or refuses to appear, or, appearing, refuses to testify, the judge of the district in which the subpena issued may proceed, on proper process, to enforce obedience to the subpena, or to punish for disobedience, in the same manner as a court of the United States may in case of process of subpena ad testificandum issued by the court.

<br>(b) 	5 U.S.C. 96. 	R.S. §186.
<br>
<br>In subsection (a), the words "Executive department" are substituted for "department" as the definition of "department" applicable to this section is coextensive with the definition of "Executive department" in section 101. The word "thereof" is added to reflect the proper relationship between "department" and "bureau" as reflected in title IV of the Revised Statutes of 1878. The words "in any State, District, or Territory" are omitted as unnecessary. The word "individual" is substituted for "officer" as the definition of "officer" in section 2104 is narrower than the word "officer" in R.S. §184 which word includes "officers" as defined in section 2104 as well as notaries public who are not "officers" under section 2104, but are "officers" as that word is used in R.S. §184.
<br>
<br>In subsection (a), the words "or military department" are inserted to preserve the application of the source law. Before enactment of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (63 Stat. 578), the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force were Executive departments. The National Security Act Amendments of 1949 established the Department of Defense as an Executive Department including the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force as military departments, not as Executive departments. However, the source law for this section, which was in effect in 1949, remained applicable to the Secretaries of the military departments by virtue of section 12(g) of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (63 Stat. 591), which is set out in the reviser's note for section 301.
<br>
<br>This section was part of title IV of the Revised Statutes. The Act of July 26, 1947, ch. 343, §201(d), as added Aug. 10, 1949, ch. 412, §4, 63 Stat. 579 (former 5 U.S.C. 171–1), which provides "Except to the extent inconsistent with the provisions of this Act [National Security Act of 1947], the provisions of title IV of the Revised Statutes as now or hereafter amended shall be applicable to the Department of Defense" is omitted from this title but is not repealed.

<br>§305. Systematic agency review of operations
<br>
<br>(a) For the purpose of this section, "agency" means an Executive agency, but does not include—
<br>
<br>(1) a Government controlled corporation;
<br>
<br>(2) the Tennessee Valley Authority;
<br>
<br>(3) the Virgin Islands Corporation;
<br>
<br>(4) the Atomic Energy Commission;
<br>
<br>(5) the Central Intelligence Agency;
<br>
<br>(6) the Panama Canal Commission; or
<br>
<br>(7) the National Security Agency, Department of Defense.
<br>
<br>(b) Under regulations prescribed and administered by the President, each agency shall review systematically the operations of each of its activities, functions, or organization units, on a continuing basis.
<br>
<br>(c) The purpose of the reviews includes—
<br>
<br>(1) determining the degree of efficiency and economy in the operation of the agency's activities, functions, or organization units;
<br>
<br>(2) identifying the units that are outstanding in those respects; and
<br>
<br>(3) identifying the employees whose personal efforts have caused their units to be outstanding in efficiency and economy of operations.

<br>
<br>Subsection (a) is based in part on former sections 1081 and 1082, which are carried into section 5102.
<br>
<br>In subsection (a)(1), the exception of "a Government controlled corporation" is added to preserve the application of this section to "corporations wholly owned by the United States". This is necessary as the defined term "Executive agency" includes the defined term "Government corporation" and the latter includes both Government owned and controlled corporations. Thus the exclusion of Government controlled corporations, which are distinct from wholly owned corporations, operates to preserve the application of this section to wholly owned corporations. The exception for the Inland Waterways Corporation in former section 1082(13) is omitted on authority of the Act of July 19, 1963, Pub. L. 88–67, 77 Stat. 81. The exceptions for Production Credit Corporations and Federal Intermediate Credit Banks in former section 1082(18) and (19) are omitted as they are no longer "corporations wholly owned by the United States". Under the Farm Credit Act of 1956, 70 Stat. 659, the Production Credit Corporations were merged in the Federal Intermediate Credit Banks, and pursuant to that Act the Federal Intermediate Credit Banks have ceased to be corporations wholly owned by the United States.
<br>
<br>In subsection (a)(7), the words "Panama Canal Company" are substituted for "Panama Railroad Company" on authority of the Act of Sept. 26, 1950, ch. 1049, §2(a)(2), 64 Stat. 1038.
