<br>29	And the king of Israel said to Josaphat: I will change my dress, and so I will go to the battle, but put thou on thy own garments. And the king of Israel having changed his dress, went to the battle.
<br>30	Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of his cavalry, saying: Fight ye not with small, or great, but with the king of Israel only.
<br>31	So when the captains of the cavalry saw Josaphat, they said: This is the king of Israel. And they surrounded him to attack him: but he cried to the Lord, and he helped him, and turned them away from him.
<br>32	For when the captains of the cavalry saw, that he was not the king of Israel, they left him.
<br>33	And it happened that one of the people shot an arrow at a venture, and struck the king of Israel between the neck and the shoulders, and he said to his chariot man: Turn thy hand, and carry me out of the battle, for I am wounded.
<br>34	And the fight was ended that day: but the king of Israel stood in his chariot against the Syrians until the evening, and died at the sunset.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 19
<br>And Josaphat king of Juda returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem.
<br>2	And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer met him, and said to him: Thou helpest the ungodly, and thou art joined in friendship with them that hate the Lord, and therefore thou didst deserve indeed the wrath of the Lord:
<br>3	But good works are found in thee, because thou hast taken away the groves out of the land of Juda, and hast prepared thy heart to seek the Lord the God of thy fathers.
<br>4	And Josaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again to the people from Bersabee to mount Ephraim, and brought them back to the Lord the God of their fathers.
<br>5	And he set judges of the land in all the fenced cities of Juda, in every place.
<br>6	And charging the judges, he said: Take heed what you do: for you exercise not the judgment of man, but of the Lord: and whatsoever you judge, it shall redound to you.
<br>7	Let the fear of the Lord be with you, and do all things with diligence: for there is no iniquity with the Lord our God, nor respect of persons, nor desire of gifts.
<br>8	In Jerusalem also Josaphat appointed Levites, and priests and chiefs of the families of Israel, to judge the judgment and the cause of the Lord for the inhabitants thereof.
<br>9	And he charged them, saying, Thus shall you do in the fear of the Lord faithfully, and with a perfect heart.
<br>10	Every cause that shall come to you of your brethren, that dwell in their cities, be- tween kindred and kindred, wheresoever there is question concerning the law, the command- ment, the ceremonies, the justifications: shew it them, that they may not sin against the Lord,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>and that wrath may not come upon you and your brethren: and so doing you shall not sin.
<br>11	And Amarias the priest your high priest shall be chief in the things which regard God: and Zabadias the son of Ismahel, who is ruler in the house of Juda, shall be over those matters which belong to the king’s office: and you have before you the Levites for masters, take courage and do diligently, and the Lord will be with you in good things.
<br>
<br>
<br>Chapter 20
<br>
<br>After this the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them of the Ammonites, were gathered together to fight against Josaphat. 2 And there came messengers, and told Jos- aphat, saying: There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea, and out of Syria, and behold they are in Asasonthamar,
<br>which is Engaddi.
<br>3	And Josaphat being seized with fear betook himself wholly to pray to the Lord, and he pro- claimed a fast for all Juda.
<br>4	And Juda gathered themselves together to pray to the Lord: and all came out of their cities to make supplication to him.
<br>5	And Josaphat stood in the midst of the as- sembly of Juda, and Jerusalem, in the house of the Lord before the new court,
<br>6	And said: O Lord God of our fathers, thou art God in heaven, and rulest over all the king- doms and nations, in thy hand is strength and power, and no one can resist thee.
<br>7	Didst not thou our God kill all the inhab- itants of this land before thy people Israel, and gavest it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for ever?
<br> 
<br>8	And they dwelt in it, and built in it a sanc- tuary to thy name, saying:
<br>9	If evils fall upon us, the sword of judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we will stand in thy presence before this house, in which thy name is called upon: and we will cry to thee in our afflictions, and thou wilt hear, and save us.
<br>10	Now therefore behold the children of Am- mon, and of Moab, and mount Seir, through whose lands thou didst not allow Israel to pass, when they came out of Egypt, but they turned aside from them, and slew them not,
<br>11	Do the contrary, and endeavour to cast us out of the possession which thou hast delivered to us.
<br>12	O our God, wilt thou not then judge them? as for us we have not strength enough, to be able to resist this multitude, which cometh violently upon us. But as we know not what to do, we can only turn our eyes to thee.
<br>13	And all Juda stood before the Lord with their little ones, and their wives, and their chil- dren.
<br>14	And Jahaziel the son of Zacharias, the son of Banaias, the son of Jehiel, the son of Math- anias, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, was there, upon whom the spirit of the Lord came in the midst of the multitude,
<br>15	And he said: Attend ye, all Juda, and you that dwell in Jerusalem, and thou king Josaphat: Thus saith the Lord to you: Fear ye not, and be not dismayed at this multitude: for the battle is not yours, but God’s.
<br>16	To morrow you shall go down against them: for they will come up by the ascent named Sis, and you shall find them at the head of the tor- rent, which is over against the wilderness of Jeruel.
<br>17	It shall not be you that shall fight, but only stand with confidence, and you shall see the help
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>of the Lord over you, O Juda, and Jerusalem: fear ye not, nor be you dismayed: to morrow you shall go out against them, and the Lord will be with you.
<br>18	Then Josaphat, and Juda, and all the in- habitants of Jerusalem fell flat on the ground before the Lord, and adored him.
<br>19	And the Levites of the sons of Caath, and of the sons of Core praised the Lord the God of Israel with a loud voice, on high.
<br>20	And they rose early in the morning, and went out through the desert of Thecua: and as they were marching, Josaphat standing in the midst of them, said: Hear me, ye men of Juda, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem: believe in the Lord your God, and you shall be secure: be- lieve his prophets, and all things shall succeed well.
<br>21	And he gave counsel to the people, and appointed the singing men of the Lord, to praise him by their companies, and to go before the army, and with one voice to say: Give glory to the Lord, for his mercy endureth for ever.
<br>22	And when they began to sing praises, the Lord turned their ambushments upon them- selves, that is to say, of the children of Ammon, and of Moab, and of mount Seir, who were come out to fight against Juda, and they were slain.
<br>23	For the children of Ammon, and of Moab, rose up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, to kill and destroy them: and when they had made an end of them, they turned also against one another, and destroyed one another.
<br>24	And when Juda came to the watch tower, that looketh toward the desert, they saw afar off all the country, for a great space, full of dead bodies, and that no one was left that could es- cape death.
<br>25	Then Josaphat came, and all the people with him to take away the spoils of the dead,
<br> 
<br>and they found among the dead bodies, stuff of various kinds, and garments, and most precious vessels: and they took them for themselves, inso- much that they could not carry all, nor in three days take away the spoils, the booty was so great. 26 And on the fourth day they were assembled in the valley of Blessing: for there they blessed the Lord, and therefore they called that place
<br>the valley of Blessing until this day.
<br>27	And every man of Juda, and the inhab- itants of Jerusalem returned, and Josaphat at their head, into Jerusalem with great joy, be- cause the Lord had made them rejoice over their enemies.
<br>28	And they came into Jerusalem with psalteries, and harps, and trumpets into the house of the Lord.
<br>29	And the fear of the Lord fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands when they heard that the Lord had fought against the enemies of Israel.
<br>30	And the kingdom of Josaphat was quiet, and God gave him peace round about.
<br>31	And Josaphat reigned over Juda, and he was five and thirty years old, when he began to reign: and he reigned five and twenty years in Jerusalem: and the name of his mother was Azuba the daughter of Selahi.
<br>32	And he walked in the way of his father Asa and departed not from it, doing the things that were pleasing before the Lord.
<br>33	But yet he took not away the high places, and the people had not yet turned their heart to the Lord the God of their fathers.
<br>34	But the rest of the acts of Josaphat, first and last, are written in the words of Jehu the son of Hanani, which he digested into the books of the kings of Israel.
<br>35	After these things Josaphat king of Juda made friendship with Ochozias king of Israel, whose works were very wicked.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>36	And he was partner with him in making ships, to go to Tharsis: and they made the ships in Asiongaber.
<br>37	And Eliezer the son of Dodau of Maresa prophesied to Josaphat, saying: Because thou hast made a league with Ochozias, the Lord hath destroyed thy works, and the ships are broken, and they could not go to Tharsis.
<br>
<br>Chapter 21
<br>And Josaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with them in the city of David: and Jo- ram his son reigned in his stead.
<br>2	And he had brethren the sons of Josaphat, Azarias, and Jahiel, and Zacharias, and Azaria, and Michael, and Saphatias, all these were the sons of Josaphat king of Juda.
<br>3	And their father gave them great gifts of sil- ver, and of gold, and pensions, with strong cities in Juda: but the kingdom he gave to Joram, be- cause he was the eldest.
<br>4	So Joram rose up over the kingdom of his father: and when he had established himself, he slew all his brethren with the sword, and some of the princes of Israel.
<br>5	Joram was two and thirty years old when he began to reign: and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
<br>6	And he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, as the house of Achab had done: for his wife was a daughter of Achab, and he did evil in the sight of the Lord.
<br>7	But the Lord would not destroy the house of David: because of the covenant which he had made with him: and because he had promised to give a lamp to him, and to his sons for ever.
<br>8	In those days Edom revolted, from being subject to Juda, and made themselves a king.
<br> 
<br>9	And Joram went over with his princes, and all his cavalry with him, and rose in the night, and defeated the Edomites who had surrounded him, and all the captains of his cavalry.
<br>10	However Edom revolted, from being un- der the dominion of Juda unto this day: at that time Lobna also revolted, from being under his hand. For he had forsaken the Lord the God of his fathers.
<br>11	Moreover he built also high places in the cities of Juda, and he made the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication, and Juda to transgress.
<br>12	And there was a letter brought him from Eliseus the prophet, in which it was written: Thus saith the Lord the God of David thy fa- ther: Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Josaphat thy father nor in the ways of Asa king of Juda,
<br>13	But hast walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and hast made Juda and the inhab- itants of Jerusalem to commit fornication, im- itating the fornication of the house of Achab, moreover also thou hast killed thy brethren, the house of thy father, better men than thyself,
<br>14	Behold the Lord will strike thee with a great plague, with all thy people, and thy chil- dren, and thy wives, and all thy substance.
<br>15	And thou shalt be sick of a very grievous disease of thy bowels, till thy vital parts come out by little and little every day.
<br>16	And the Lord stirred up against Joram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, who border on the Ethiopians.
<br>17	And they came up into the land of Juda, and wasted it, and they carried away all the sub- stance that was found in the king’s house,  his sons also, and his wives: so that there was no son left him but Joachaz, who was the youngest. 18 And besides all this the Lord struck him
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>with an incurable disease in his bowels.
<br>19	And as day came after day, and time rolled on, two whole years passed: then after being wasted with a long consumption, so as to void his very bowels, his disease ended with his life. And he died of a most wretched illness, and the people did not make a funeral for him according to the manner of burning, as they had done for his ancestors.
<br>20	He was two and thirty years old when he began his reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. And he walked not rightly, and they buried him in the city of David: but not in the sepulchres of the kings.
<br>
<br>Chapter 22
<br>And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ochozias his youngest son king in his place: for the rovers of the Arabians, who had broke in upon the camp, had killed all that were his elder broth- ers. So Ochozias the son of Joram king of Juda reigned.
<br>2	Ochozias was forty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother was Athalia the daughter of Amri.
<br>3	He also walked in the ways of the house of Achab: for his mother pushed him on to do wickedly.
<br>4	So he did evil in the sight of the Lord, as the house of Achab did: for they were his counsellors after the death of his father, to his destruction. 5 And he walked after their counsels. And he went with Joram the son of Achab king of Israel, to fight against Hazael king of Syria, at Ramoth
<br>Galaad: and the Syrians wounded Joram.
<br>6	And he returned to be healed in Jezrahel: for he received many wounds in the foresaid battle.
<br> 
<br>And Ochozias the son of Joram king of Juda, went down to visit Joram the son of Achab in Jezrahel where he lay sick.
<br>7	For it was the will of God against Ochozias that he should come to Joram: and when he was come should go out also against Jehu the son of Namsi, whom the Lord had anointed to destroy the house of Achab.
<br>8	So when Jehu was rooting out the house of Achab, he found the princes of Juda, and the sons of the brethren of Ochozias, who served him, and he slew them.
<br>9	And he sought for Ochozias himself, and took him lying hid in Samaria: and when he was brought to him, he killed him, and they buried him: because he was the son of Josaphat, who had sought the Lord with all his heart. And there was no more hope that any one should reign of the race of Ochozias.
<br>10	For Athalia his mother, seeing that her son was dead, rose up, and killed all the royal family of the house of Joram.
<br>11	But Josabeth the king’s daughter took Joas the son of Ochozias, and stole him from among the king’s sons that were slain. And she hid him with his nurse in a bedchamber: now Josabeth that hid him, was daughter of king Joram, wife of Joiada the high priest, and sister of Ochozias, and therefore Athalia did not kill him.
<br>12	And he was with them hid in the house of God six years, during which Athalia reigned over the land.
<br>
<br>Chapter 23
<br>And in the seventh year Joiada being encour- aged, took the captains of hundreds, to wit, Azarias the son of Jeroham, and Ismahel the son of Johanan, and Azarias the son of Obed, and
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Maasias the son of Adaias, and Elisaphat the son of Zechri: and made a covenant with them. 2 And they went about Juda, and gathered together the Levites out of all the cities of Juda, and the chiefs of the families of Israel, and they
<br>came to Jerusalem.
<br>3	And all the multitude made a covenant with the king in the house of God: and Joiada said to them: Behold the king’s son shall reign, as the Lord hath said of the sons of David.
<br>4	And this is the thing that you shall do:
<br>5	A third part of you that come to the sab- bath, of the priests, and of the Levites, and of the porters shall be at the gates: and a third part at the king’s house: and a third at the gate that is called the Foundation: but let all the rest of the people be in the courts of the house of the Lord.
<br>6	And let no one come into the house of the Lord, but the priests, and they that minister of the Levites: let them only come in, because they are sanctified: and let all the rest of the people keep the watches of the Lord.
<br>7	And let the Levites be round about the king, every man with his arms; and if any other come into the temple, let him be slain; and let them be with the king, both coming in, and going out. 8 So the Levites, and all Juda did according to all that Joiada the high priest had commanded: and they took every one his men that were under him, and that came in by the course of the sab- bath, with those who had fulfilled the sabbath, and were to go out. For Joiada the high priest permitted not the companies to depart,  which were accustomed to succeed one another every
<br>week.
<br>9 And Joiada the priest gave to the captains the spears, and the shields, and targets of king David, which he had dedicated in the house of the Lord.
<br> 
<br>10	And he set all the people with swords in their hands from the right side of the temple, to the left side of the temple, before the altar, and the temple, round about the king.
<br>11	And they brought out the king’s son, and put the crown upon him, and the testimony, and gave him the law to hold in his hand, and they made him king: and Joiada the high priest and his sons anointed him: and they prayed for him, and said:  God save the king.
<br>12	Now when Athalia heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came in to the people, into the temple of the Lord.
<br>13	And when she saw the king standing upon the step in the entrance, and the princes, and the companies about him, and all the people of the land rejoicing, and sounding with trumpets, and playing on instruments of divers kinds, and the voice of those that praised, she rent her gar- ments, and said: Treason, treason.
<br>14	And Joiada the high priest going out to the captains, and the chiefs of the army, said to them: Take her forth without the precinct of the temple, and when she is without let her be killed with the sword. For the priest commanded that she should not be killed in the house of the Lord. 15 And they laid hold on her by the neck: and when she was come within the horse gate of the
<br>palace, they killed her there.
<br>16	And Joiada made a covenant between him- self and all the people, and the king, that they should be the people of the lord.
<br>17	And all the people went into the house of Baal, and destroyed it: and they broke down his altars and his idols: and they slew Mathan the priest of Baal before the altars.
<br>18	And Joiada appointed overseers in the house of the Lord, under the hands of the priests, and the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house of the Lord: to offer holocausts to the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Lord, as it is written in the law of Moses, with joy and singing, according to the disposition of David.
<br>19	He appointed also porters in the gates of the house of the Lord, that none who was un- clean in any thing should enter in.
<br>20	And he took the captains of hundreds, and the most valiant men, and the chiefs of the peo- ple, and all the people of the land, and they brought down the king from the house of the Lord, and brought him through the upper gate into the king’s house, and set him on the royal throne.
<br>21	And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet: but Athalia was slain with the sword.
<br>
<br>Chapter 24
<br>Joas was seven years old when he began to reign: and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem: the name of his mother was Sebia of Bersabee.
<br>2	And he did that which is good before the Lord all the days of Joiada the priest.
<br>3	And Joiada took for him two wives, by whom he had sons and daughters.
<br>4	After this Joas had a mind to repair the house of the Lord.
<br>5	And he assembled the priests, and the Levites, and said to them: Go out to the cities of Juda, and gather of all Israel money to repair the temple of your God, from year to year: and do this with speed: but the Levites were negligent. 6 And the king called Joiada the chief, and said to him: Why hast thou not taken care to oblige the Levites to bring in out of Juda and Jerusalem the money that was appointed by Moses the servant of the Lord for all the multi- tude of Israel to bring into the tabernacle of the
<br> 
<br>testimony?
<br>7	For that wicked woman Athalia, and her children have destroyed the house of God, and adorned the temple of Baal with all the things that had been dedicated in the temple of the Lord.
<br>8	And the king commanded, and they made a chest: and set it by the gate of the house of the Lord on the outside.
<br>9	And they made a proclamation in Juda and Jerusalem, that every man should bring to the Lord the money which Moses the servant of God appointed for all Israel, in the desert.
<br>10	And all the princes, and all the people re- joiced: and going in they contributed and cast so much into the chest of the Lord, that it was filled.
<br>11	And when it was time to bring the chest before the king by the hands of the Levites, (for they saw there was much money,) the king’s scribe, and he whom the high priest had ap- pointed went in: and they poured out the money that was in the chest: and they carried back the chest to its place: and thus they did from day to day, and there was gathered an immense sum of money.
<br>12	And the king and Joiada gave it to those who were over the works of the house of the Lord: but they hired with it stonecutters, and artificers of every kind of work to repair the house of the Lord: and such as wrought in iron and brass, to uphold what began to be falling.
<br>13	And the workmen were diligent, and the breach of the walls was closed up by their hands, and they set up the house of the Lord in its for- mer state, and made it stand firm.
<br>14	And when they had finished all the works, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Joiada: and with it were made vessels for the temple for the ministry, and for holo-
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>causts and bowls, and other vessels of gold and silver: and holocausts were offered in the house of the Lord continually all the days of Joiada.
<br>15	But Joiada grew old and was full of days, and died when he was a hundred and thirty years old.
<br>16	And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good to Israel, and to his house.
<br>17	And after the death of Joiada, the princes of Juda went in, and worshipped the king: and he was soothed by their services and hearkened to them.
<br>18	And they forsook the temple of the Lord the God of their fathers, and served groves and idols, and wrath came upon Juda and Jerusalem for this sin.
<br>19	And he sent prophets to them to bring them back to the Lord, and they would not give ear when they testified against them.
<br>20	The spirit of God then came upon Zacharias the son of Joiada the priest, and he stood in the sight of the people, and said to them: Thus saith the Lord God: Why transgress you the commandment of the Lord which will not be for your good, and have forsaken the Lord, to make him forsake you?
<br>21	And they gathered themselves together against him, and stoned him at the king’s com- mandment in the court of the house of the Lord. 22 And king Joas did not remember the kind- ness that Joiada his father had done to him, but killed his son. And when he died, he said: The
<br>Lord see, and require it.
<br>23	And when a year was come about, the army of Syria came up against him: and they came to Juda and Jerusalem, and killed all the princes of the people, and they sent all the spoils to the king of Damascus.
<br>24	And whereas there came a very small num-
<br> 
<br>ber of the Syrians, the Lord delivered into their hands an infinite multitude, because they had forsaken the Lord the God of their fathers: and on Joas they executed shameful judgments.
<br>25	And departing they left him in great dis- eases: and his servants rose up against him, for revenge of the blood of the son of Joiada the priest, and they slew him in his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchres of the kings.
<br>26	Now the men that conspired against him were Zabad the son of Semmaath an Am- monitess, and Jozabad the son of Semarith a Moabitess.
<br>27	And concerning his sons, and the sum of money which was gathered under him, and the repairing the house of God, they are writ- ten more diligently in the book of kings: and Amasias his son reigned in his stead.
<br>
<br>Chapter 25
<br>Amasias was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem, the name of his mother was Joadan of Jerusalem.
<br>2	And he did what was good in the sight of the Lord: but yet not with a perfect heart.
<br>3	And when he saw himself strengthened in his kingdom, he put to death the servants that had slain the king his father.
<br>4	But he slew not their children, as it is writ- ten in the book of the law of Moses, where the Lord commanded, saying: The fathers shall not be slain for the children, nor the children for their fathers, but every man shall die for his own sin.
<br>5	Amasias therefore gathered Juda together, and appointed them by families, and captains
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>of thousands and of hundreds in all Juda, and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and upwards, and found three hundred thousand young men that could go out to battle, and could hold the spear and shield.
<br>6	He hired also of Israel a hundred thousand valiant men, for a hundred talents of silver.
<br>7	But a man of God came to him,  and said: O king, let not the army of Israel go out with thee, for the Lord is not with Israel, and all the children of Ephraim:
<br>8	And if thou think that battles consist in the strength of the army, God will make thee to be overcome by the enemies: for it belongeth to God both to help, and to put to flight.
<br>9	And Amasias said to the man of God: What will then become of the hundred talents which I have given to the soldiers of Israel? and the man of God answered him: The Lord is rich enough to be able to give thee much more than this.
<br>10	Then Amasias separated the army, that came to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: but they being much enraged against Juda, re- turned to their own country.
<br>11	And Amasias taking courage led forth his people, and went to the vale of saltpits, and slew of the children of Seir ten thousand.
<br>12	And other ten thousand men the sons of Juda took, and brought to the steep of a certain rock, and cast them down headlong from the top, and they all were broken to pieces.
<br>13	But that army which Amasias had sent back, that they should not go with him to bat- tle, spread themselves among the cities of Juda, from Samaria to Beth-horon, and having killed three thousand took away much spoil.
<br>14	But Amasias after he had slain the Edomites, set up the gods of the children of Seir, which he had brought thence, to be his gods, and adored them, and burnt incense to them.
<br> 
<br>15	Wherefore the Lord being angry against Amasias, sent a prophet to him, to say to him: Why hast thou adored gods that have not deliv- ered their own people out of thy hand?
<br>16	And when he spoke these things, he an- swered him: Art thou the king’s counsellor? be quiet, lest I kill thee. And the prophet depart- ing, said: I know that God is minded to kill thee, because thou hast done this evil, and moreover hast not hearkened to my counsel.
<br>17	Then Amasias king of Juda taking very bad counsel, sent to Joas the son of Joachaz the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying: Come, let us see one another.
<br>18	But he sent back the messengers, saying: The thistle that is in Libanus, sent to the cedar in Libanus, saying: Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and behold the beasts that were in the wood of Libanus passed by and trod down the thistle.
<br>19	Thou hast said: I have overthrown Edom, and therefore thy heart is lifted up with pride: stay at home, why dost thou provoke evil against thee, that both thou shouldst fall and Juda with thee.
<br>20	Amasias would not hearken to him, be- cause it was the Lord’s will that he should be delivered into the hands of enemies, because of the gods of Edom.
<br>21	So Joas king of Israel went up, and they presented themselves to be seen by one another: and Amasias king of Juda was in Bethsames of Juda:
<br>22	And Juda fell before Israel, and they fled to their dwellings.
<br>23	And Joas king of Israel took Amasias king of Juda, the son of Joas, the son of Joachaz, in Bethsames, and brought him to Jerusalem: and broke down the walls thereof from the gate of Ephraim, to the gate of the corner, four hundred
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>cubits.
<br>24	And he took all the gold, and silver, and all the vessels, that he found in the house of God, and with Obededom, and in the treasures of the king’s house, moreover also the sons of the hostages, he brought back to Samaria.
<br>25	And Amasias the son of Joas king of Juda lived, after the death of Joas the son of Joachaz king of Israel, fifteen years.
<br>26	Now the rest of the acts of Amasias, the first and last, are written in the book of the kings of Juda and Israel.
<br>27	And after he revolted from the Lord, they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem. And he fled into Lachis, and they sent, and killed him there.
<br>28	And they brought him back upon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of David.
<br>
<br>Chapter 26
<br>And all the people of Juda took his son Ozias, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of Amasias his father.
<br>2	He built Ailath, and restored it to the do- minion of Juda, after that the king slept with his fathers.
<br>3	Ozias was sixteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two and fifty years in Jerusalem: the name of his mother was Jechelia of Jerusalem.
<br>4	And he did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, according to all that Amasias his father had done.
<br>5	And he sought the Lord in the days of Zacharias that understood and saw God: and as long as he sought the Lord, he directed him in all things.
<br> 
<br>6	Moreover he went forth and fought against the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Geth, and the wall of Jabnia, and the wall of Azotus: and he built towns in Azotus, and among the Philistines.
<br>7	And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians, that dwelt in Gurbaal, and against the Ammonites.
<br>8	And the Ammonites gave gifts to Ozias: and his name was spread abroad even to the entrance of Egypt for his frequent victories.
<br>9	And Ozias built towers in Jerusalem over the gate of the corner, and over the gate of the valley, and the rest, in the same side of the wall, and fortified them.
<br>10	And he built towers in the wilderness, and dug many cisterns, for he had much cattle both in the plains, and in the waste of the desert: he had also vineyards and dressers of vines in the mountains, and in Carmel: for he was a man that loved husbandry.
<br>11	And the army of his fighting men, that went out to war, was under the hand of Jehiel the scribe, and Maasias the doctor, and under the hand of Henanias, who was one of the king’s captains.
<br>12	And the whole number of the chiefs by the families of valiant men were two thousand six hundred.
<br>13	And the whole army under them three hun- dred and seven thousand five hundred: who were fit for war, and fought for the king against the enemy.
<br>14	And Ozias prepared for them, that is, for the whole army, shields, and spears, and helmets, and coats of mail, and bows, and slings to cast stones.
<br>15	And he made in Jerusalem engines of di- verse kinds, which he placed in the towers, and in the corners of the walls, to shoot arrows,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>and great stones:   and his name went forth far abroad, for the Lord helped him, and had strengthened him.
<br>16	But when he was made strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction, and he neglected the Lord his God: and going into the temple of the Lord, he had a mind to burn incense upon the altar of incense.
<br>17	And immediately Azarias the priest going in after him, and with him fourscore priests of the Lord, most valiant men,
<br>18	Withstood the king and said: It doth not belong to thee, Ozias, to burn incense to the Lord, but to the priests, that is, to the sons of Aaron, who are consecrated for this ministry: go out of the sanctuary, do not despise: for this thing shall not be accounted to thy glory by the Lord God.
<br>19	And Ozias was angry, and holding in his hand the censer to burn incense, threatened the priests. And presently there rose a leprosy in his forehead before the priests, in the house of the Lord at the altar of incense.
<br>20	And Azarias the high priest, and all the rest of the priests looked upon him, and saw the leprosy in his forehead, and they made haste to thrust him out. Yea himself also being fright- ened, hasted to go out, because he had quickly felt the stroke of the Lord.
<br>21	And Ozias the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and he dwelt in a house apart being full of the leprosy, for which he had been cast out of the house of the Lord. And Joatham his son governed the king’s house, and judged the people of the land.
<br>22	But the rest of the acts of Ozias first and last were written by Isaias the son of Amos, the prophet.
<br>23	And Ozias slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the field of the royal sepulchres,
<br> 
<br>because he was a leper: and Joatham his son reigned in his stead.
<br>
<br>
<br>Chapter 27
<br>
<br>Joatham was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: the name of his mother was Jerusa the daughter of Sadoc.
<br>2	And he did that which was right before the Lord, according to all that Ozias his father had done, only that he entered not into the temple of the Lord, and the people still transgressed.
<br>3	He built the high gate of the house of the Lord, and on the wall of Ophel he built much.
<br>4	Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Juda, and castles and towers in the forests.
<br>5	He fought against the king of the children of Ammon, and overcame them, and the children of Ammon gave him at that time a hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and as many measures of barley: so much did the children of Ammon give him in the second and third year.
<br>6	And Joatham was strengthened, because he had his way directed before the Lord his God.
<br>7	Now the rest of the acts of Joatham, and all his wars, and his works, are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Juda.
<br>8	He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.
<br>9	And Joatham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Achaz his son reigned in his stead.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 28
<br>Achaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: he did not that which was right in the sight of the Lord as David his father had done,
<br>2	But walked in the ways of the kings of Israel; moreover also he cast statues for Baalim.
<br>3	It was he that burnt incense in the valley of Benennom, and consecrated his sons in the fire according to the manner of the nations, which the Lord slew at the coming of the children of Israel.
<br>4	He sacrificed also, and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.
<br>5	And the Lord his God delivered him into the hands of the king of Syria, who defeated him, and took a great booty out of his kingdom, and carried it to Damascus: he was also delivered into the hands of the king of Israel, who over- threw him with a great slaughter.
<br>6	For Phacee the son of Romelia slew of Juda a hundred and twenty thousand in one day, all valiant men, because they had forsaken the Lord the God of their fathers.
<br>7	At the same time Zechri a powerful man of Ephraim, slew Maasias the king’s son, and Ezricam the governor of his house, and Elcana who was next to the king.
<br>8	And the children of Israel carried away of their brethren two hundred thousand women, boys, and girls, and an immense booty: and they brought it to Samaria.
<br>9	At that time there was a prophet of the Lord there, whose name was Oded: and he went out to meet the army that came to Samaria, and said to them: Behold the Lord the God of your fathers being angry with Juda, hath delivered them into your hands, and you have butchered
<br> 
<br>them cruelly, so that your cruelty hath reached up to heaven.
<br>10	Moreover you have a mind to keep un- der the children of Juda and Jerusalem for your bondmen and bondwomen, which ought not to be done: for you have sinned in this against the Lord your God.
<br>11	But hear ye my counsel, and release the captives that you have brought of your brethren, because a great indignation of the Lord hangeth over you.
<br>12	Then some of the chief men of the sons of Ephraim, Azarias the son of Johanan, Barachias the son of Mosollamoth, Ezechias the son of Sel- lum, and Amasa the son of Adali, stood up against them that came from the war.
<br>13	And they said to them: You shall not bring in the captives hither, lest we sin against the Lord. Why will you add to our sins, and heap up upon our former offences? for the sin is great, and the fierce anger of the Lord hangeth over Israel.
<br>14	So the soldiers left the spoils, and all that they had taken, before the princes and all the multitude.
<br>15	And the men, whom we mentioned above, rose up and took the captives, and with the spoils clothed all them that were naked: and when they had clothed and shod them, and re- freshed them with meat and drink, and anointed them because of their labour, and had taken care of them, they set such of them as could not walk, and were feeble, upon beasts, and brought them to Jericho the city of palm trees to their brethren, and they returned to Samaria.
<br>16	At that time king Achaz sent to the king of the Assyrians asking help.
<br>17	And the Edomites came and slew many of Juda, and took a great booty.
<br>18	The Philistines also spread themselves
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>among the cities of the plains, and to the south of Juda: and they took Bethsames, and Aialon, and Gaderoth, and Socho, and Thamnan, and Gamzo, with their villages, and they dwelt in them.
<br>19	For the Lord had humbled Juda because of Achaz the king of Juda, for he had stripped it of help, and had contemned the Lord.
<br>20	And he brought against him Thelgathphal- nasar king of the Assyrians, who also afflicted him, and plundered him without any resistance. 21 And Achaz stripped the house of the Lord, and the house of the kings, and of the princes, and gave gifts to the king of the Assyrians, and
<br>yet it availed him nothing.
<br>22	Moreover also in the time of his distress he increased contempt against the Lord: king Achaz himself by himself,
<br>23	Sacrificed victims to the gods of Damascus that struck him, and he said: The gods of the kings of Syria help them, and I will appease them with victims, and they will help me; whereas on the contrary they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.
<br>24	Then Achaz having taken away all the ves- sels of the house of God, and broken them, shut up the doors of the temple of God, and made himself altars in all the corners of Jerusalem.
<br>25	And in all the cities of Juda he built altars to burn frankincense, and he provoked the Lord the God of his fathers to wrath.
<br>26	But the rest of his acts, and all his works first and last are written in the book of the kings of Juda and Israel.
<br>27	And Achaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of Jerusalem: for they received him not into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel. And Ezechias his son reigned in his stead.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 29
<br>Now Ezechias began to reign, when he was five and twenty years old, and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem: the name of his mother was Abia, the daughter of Zacharias.
<br>2	And he did that which was pleasing in the sight of the Lord, according to all that David his father had done.
<br>3	In the first year and month of his reign he opened the doors of the house of the Lord, and repaired them.
<br>4	And he brought the priests and the Levites, and assembled them in the east street.
<br>5	And he said to them: Hear me, ye Levites, and be sanctified, purify the house of the Lord the God of your fathers, and take away all filth out of the sanctuary.
<br>6	Our fathers have sinned and done evil in the sight of the Lord God, forsaking him: they have turned away their faces from the tabernacle of the Lord, and turned their backs.
<br>7	They have shut up the doors that were in the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burnt incense, nor offered holocausts in the sanc- tuary of the God of Israel.
<br>8	Therefore the wrath of the Lord hath been stirred up against Juda and Jerusalem, and he hath delivered them to trouble, and to destruc- tion, and to be hissed at, as you see with your eyes.
<br>9	Behold, our fathers are fallen by the sword, our sons, and our daughters, and wives are led away captives for this wickedness.
<br>10	Now therefore I have a mind that we make a covenant with the Lord the God of Israel, and he will turn away the wrath of his indignation from us.
<br>11	My sons, be not negligent: the Lord hath chosen you to stand before him, and to minister
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>to him, and to worship him, and to burn incense to him.
<br>12	Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azarias, of the sons of Caath: and of the sons of Merari, Cis the son of Abdi, and Azarias the son of Jalaleel. And of the sons of Gerson, Joah the son of Zemma, and Eden the son of Joah.
<br>13	And of the sons of Elisaphan, Samri, and Jahiel. Also of the sons of Asaph, Zacharias, and Mathanias.
<br>14	And of the sons of Heman, Jahiel, and Se- mei: and of the sons of Idithun, Semeias, and Oziel.
<br>15	And they gathered together their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and went in according to the commandment of the king, and the pre- cept of the Lord, to purify the house of God.
<br>16	And the priests went into the temple of the Lord to sanctify it, and brought out all the un- cleanness that they found within to the entrance of the house of the Lord, and the Levites took it away, and carried it out abroad to the torrent Cedron.
<br>17	And they began to cleanse on the first day of the first month, and on the eighth day of the same month they came into the porch of the tem- ple of the Lord, and they purified the temple in eight days, and on the sixteenth day of the same month they finished what they had begun.
<br>18	And they went in to king Ezechias, and said to him: We have sanctified all the house of the Lord, and the altar of holocaust, and the vessels thereof, and the table of proposition with all its vessels,
<br>19	And all the furniture of the temple, which king Achaz in his reign had defiled, after his transgression; and behold they are all set forth before the altar of the Lord.
<br>20	And king Ezechias rising early, assembled
<br> 
<br>all the rulers of the city, and went up into the house of the Lord:
<br>21	And they offered together seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he goats for sin, for the kingdom, for the sanctuary, for Juda: and he spoke to the priests the sons of Aaron, to offer them upon the altar of the Lord. 22 Therefore they killed the bullocks, and the priests took the blood, and poured it upon the altar; they killed also the rams, and their blood they poured also upon the altar, and they killed the lambs, and poured the blood upon the altar. 23 And they brought the he goats for sin be- fore the king, and the whole multitude, and they
<br>laid their hand upon them:
<br>24	And the priests immolated them, and sprinkled their blood before the altar for an expi- ation of all Israel: for the king had commanded that the holocaust and the sin offering should be made for all Israel.
<br>25	And he set the Levites in the house of the Lord with cymbals, and psalteries, and harps ac- cording to the regulation of David the king, and of Gad the seer, and of Nathan the prophet: for it was the commandment of the Lord by the hand of his prophets.
<br>26	And the Levites stood, with the instru- ments of David, and the priests with trumpets.
<br>27	And Ezechias commanded that they should offer holocausts upon the altar: and when the holocausts were offered, they began to sing praises to the Lord, and to sound with trumpets, and divers instruments which David the king of Israel had prepared.
<br>28	And all the multitude adored, and the singers, and the trumpeters, were in their office till the holocaust was finished.
<br>29	And when the oblation was ended, the king, and all that were with him bowed down and adored.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>30	And Ezechias and the princes commanded the Levites to praise the Lord with the words of David, and Asaph the seer: and they praised him with great joy, and bowing the knee adored. 31 And Ezechias added, and said: You have filled your hands to the Lord, come and offer vic- tims, and praises in the house of the Lord. And all the multitude offered victims, and praises,
<br>and holocausts with a devout mind.
<br>32	And the number of the holocausts which the multitude offered, was seventy bullocks, a hundred rams, and two hundred lambs.
<br>33	And they consecrated to the Lord six hun- dred oxen, and three thousand sheep.
<br>34	But the priests were few, and were not enough to flay the holocausts: wherefore the Levites their brethren helped them, till the work was ended, and priests were sanctified, for the Levites are sanctified with an easier rite than the priests.
<br>35	So there were many holocausts, and the fat of peace offerings, and the libations of holo- causts: and the service of the house of the Lord was completed.
<br>36	And Ezechias, and all the people rejoiced because the ministry of the Lord was accom- plished. For the resolution of doing this thing was taken suddenly.
<br>
<br>Chapter 30
<br>And Ezechias sent to all Israel and Juda: and he wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasses, that they should come to the house of the Lord in Jerusalem, and keep the phase to the Lord the God of Israel,
<br>2	For the king, taking counsel, and the princes, and all the assembly of Jerusalem, decreed to keep the phase the second month.
<br> 
<br>3	For they could not keep it in its time; be- cause there were not priests enough sanctified, and the people was not as yet gathered together to Jerusalem.
<br>4	And the thing pleased the king, and all the people.
<br>5	And they decreed to send messengers to all Israel from Bersabee even to Dan, that they should come, and keep the phase to the Lord the God of Israel in Jerusalem: for many had not kept it as it is prescribed by the law.
<br>6	And the posts went with letters by com- mandment of the king, and his princes, to all Israel and Juda, proclaiming according to the king’s orders: Ye children of Israel, turn again to the Lord the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Israel: and he will return to the remnant of you that have escaped the hand of the king of the Assyrians.
<br>7	Be not like your fathers, and brethren, who departed from the Lord the God of their fathers, and he hath given them up to destruction, as you see.
<br>8	Harden not your necks, as your fathers did: yield yourselves to the Lord, and come to his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified forever: serve the Lord the God of your fathers, and the wrath of his indignation shall be turned away from you.
<br>9	For if you turn again to the Lord, your brethren, and children shall find mercy before their masters, that have led them away captive, and they shall return into this land: for the Lord your God is merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if you return to him.
<br>10	So the posts went speedily from city to city, through the land of Ephraim, and of Manasses, even to Zabulon, whilst they laughed at them and mocked them.
<br>11	Nevertheless some men of Aser, and of
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Manasses, and of Zabulon, yielding to the coun- sel, came to Jerusalem.
<br>12	But the hand of God was in Juda, to give them one heart to do the word of the Lord, ac- cording to the commandment of the king, and of the princes.
<br>13	And much people were assembled to Jerusalem to celebrate the solemnity of the un- leavened bread in the second month:
<br>14	And they arose and destroyed the altars that were in Jerusalem, and took away all things in which incense was burnt to idols and cast them into the torrent Cedron.
<br>15	And they immolated the phase on the four- teenth day of the second month. And the priests and the Levites being at length sanctified offered holocausts in the house of the Lord.
<br>16	And they stood in their order according to the disposition and law of Moses the man of God: but the priests received the blood which was to be poured out, from the hands of the Levites,
<br>17	Because a great number was not sanctified: and therefore the Levites immolated the phase for them that came not in time to be sanctified to the Lord.
<br>18	For a great part of the people from Ephraim, and Manasses, and Issachar, and Zab- ulon, that had not been sanctified, ate the phase otherwise than it is written: and Ezechias prayed for them, saying: The Lord who is good will shew mercy,
<br>19	To all them, who with their whole heart, seek the Lord the God of their fathers: and will not impute it to them that they are not sancti- fied.
<br>20	And the Lord heard him, and was merciful to the people.
<br>21	And the children of Israel, that were found at Jerusalem, kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great joy, praising the Lord ev-
<br> 
<br>ery day. the Levites also, and the priests, with instruments that agreed to their office.
<br>22	And Ezechias spoke to the heart of all the Levites, that had good understanding concern- ing the Lord: and they ate during the seven days of the solemnity, immolating victims of peace of- ferings, and praising the Lord the God of their fathers.
<br>23	And it pleased the whole multitude to keep other seven days: which they did with great joy. 24 For Ezechias the king of Juda had given to the multitude a thousand bullocks, and seven thousand sheep: and the princes had given the people a thousand bullocks, and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests was sanc-
<br>tified.
<br>25	And all the multitude of Juda with the priests and Levites, and all the assembly, that came out of Israel; and the proselytes of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Juda were full of joy.
<br>26	And there was a great solemnity in Jerusalem, such as had not been in that city since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel.
<br>27	And the priests and the Levites rose up and blessed the people: and their voice was heard: and their prayer came to the holy dwelling place of heaven.
<br>
<br>Chapter 31
<br>And when these things had been duly celebrated, all Israel that were found in the cities of Juda, went out, and they broke the idols, and cut down the groves, demolished the high places, and de- stroyed the altars, not only out of all Juda and Benjamin, but out of Ephraim also and Man- asses, till they had utterly destroyed them: then all the children of Israel returned to their pos-
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>sessions and cities.
<br>2	And Ezechias appointed companies of the priests, and the Levites, by their courses, every man in his own office, to wit, both of the priests, and of the Levites, for holocausts, and for peace offerings, to minister, and to praise, and to sing in the gates of the camp of the Lord.
<br>3	And the king’s part was, that of his proper substance the holocaust should be offered always morning and evening, and on the sabbaths, and the new moons and the other solemnities, as it is written in the law of Moses.
<br>4	He commanded also the people that dwelt in Jerusalem, to give to the priests, and the Levites their portion, that they might attend to the law of the Lord.
<br>5	Which when it was noised abroad in the ears of the people, the children of Israel offered in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil, and honey: and brought the tithe of all things which the ground bringeth forth.
<br>6	Moreover the children of Israel and Juda, that dwelt in the cities of Juda, brought in the tithes of oxen, and sheep, and the tithes of holy things, which they had vowed to the Lord their God: and carrying them all, made many heaps. 7 In the third month they began to lay the foundations of the heaps, and in the seventh
<br>month, they finished them.
<br>8	And when Ezechias and his princes came in, they saw the heaps, and they blessed the Lord and the people of Israel.
<br>9	And Ezechias asked the priests and the Levites, why the heaps lay so.
<br>10	Azarias the chief priest of the race of Sadoc answered him, saying: Since the firstfruits began to be offered in the house of the Lord, we have eaten, and have been filled, and abundance is left, because the Lord hath blessed his people: and of that which is left is this great store which
<br> 
<br>thou seest.
<br>11	Then Ezechias commanded to prepare storehouses in the house of the Lord. And when they had done so,
<br>12	They brought in faithfully both the first- fruits, and the tithes, and all they had vowed. And the overseer of them was Chonenias the Levite, and Semei his brother was the second,
<br>13	And after him Jehiel, and Azarias, and Na- hath, and Asael, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Jesmachias, and Mahath, and Ba- naias, overseers under the hand of Chonenias, and Semei his brother, by the commandment of Ezechias the king, and Azarias the high priest of the house of God, to whom all things apper- tained.
<br>14	But Core the son of Jemna the Levite, the porter of the east gate, was overseer of the things which were freely offered to the Lord, and of the firstfruits and the things dedicated for the holy of holies.
<br>15	And under his charge were Eden, and Ben- jamin, Jesue, and Semeias, and Amarias, and Sechenias, in the cities of the priests, to dis- tribute faithfully portions to their brethren, both little and great:
<br>16	Besides the males from three years old and upward, to all that went into the temple of the Lord, and whatsoever there was need of in the ministry, and their offices according to their courses, day by day.
<br>17	To the priests by their families, and to the Levites from the twentieth year and upward, by their classes and companies.
<br>18	And to all the multitude, both to their wives, and to their children of both sexes, vict- uals were given faithfully out of the things that had been sanctified.
<br>19	Also of the sons of Aaron who were in the fields and in the suburbs of each city, there were
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>men appointed, to distribute portions to all the males, among the priests and the Levites.
<br>20	So Ezechias did all things which we have said in all Juda, and wrought that which was good, and right, and truth, before the Lord his God,
<br>21	In all the service of the house of the Lord according to the law and the ceremonies, desiring to seek his God with all his heart, and he did it and prospered.
<br>
<br>Chapter 32
<br>And when these things had been duly celebrated, all Israel that were found in the cities of Juda, went out, and they broke the idols, and cut down the groves, demolished the high places, and de- stroyed the altars, not only out of all Juda and Benjamin, but out of Ephraim also and Man- asses, till they had utterly destroyed them: then all the children of Israel returned to their pos- sessions and cities.
<br>2	And Ezechias appointed companies of the priests, and the Levites, by their courses, every man in his own office, to wit, both of the priests, and of the Levites, for holocausts, and for peace offerings, to minister, and to praise, and to sing in the gates of the camp of the Lord.
<br>3	And the king’s part was, that of his proper substance the holocaust should be offered always morning and evening, and on the sabbaths, and the new moons and the other solemnities, as it is written in the law of Moses.
<br>4	He commanded also the people that dwelt in Jerusalem, to give to the priests, and the Levites their portion, that they might attend to the law of the Lord.
<br>5	Which when it was noised abroad in the ears of the people, the children of Israel offered in
<br> 
<br>abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil, and honey: and brought the tithe of all things which the ground bringeth forth.
<br>6	Moreover the children of Israel and Juda, that dwelt in the cities of Juda, brought in the tithes of oxen, and sheep, and the tithes of holy things, which they had vowed to the Lord their God: and carrying them all, made many heaps. 7 In the third month they began to lay the foundations of the heaps, and in the seventh
<br>month, they finished them.
<br>8	And when Ezechias and his princes came in, they saw the heaps, and they blessed the Lord and the people of Israel.
<br>9	And Ezechias asked the priests and the Levites, why the heaps lay so.
<br>10	Azarias the chief priest of the race of Sadoc answered him, saying: Since the firstfruits began to be offered in the house of the Lord, we have eaten, and have been filled, and abundance is left, because the Lord hath blessed his people: and of that which is left is this great store which thou seest.
<br>11	Then Ezechias commanded to prepare storehouses in the house of the Lord. And when they had done so,
<br>12	They brought in faithfully both the first- fruits, and the tithes, and all they had vowed. And the overseer of them was Chonenias the Levite, and Semei his brother was the second,
<br>13	And after him Jehiel, and Azarias, and Na- hath, and Asael, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Jesmachias, and Mahath, and Ba- naias, overseers under the hand of Chonenias, and Semei his brother, by the commandment of Ezechias the king, and Azarias the high priest of the house of God, to whom all things apper- tained.
<br>14	But Core the son of Jemna the Levite, the porter of the east gate, was overseer of the things
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>which were freely offered to the Lord, and of the firstfruits and the things dedicated for the holy of holies.
<br>15	And under his charge were Eden, and Ben- jamin, Jesue, and Semeias, and Amarias, and Sechenias, in the cities of the priests, to dis- tribute faithfully portions to their brethren, both little and great:
<br>16	Besides the males from three years old and upward, to all that went into the temple of the Lord, and whatsoever there was need of in the ministry, and their offices according to their courses, day by day.
<br>17	To the priests by their families, and to the Levites from the twentieth year and upward, by their classes and companies.
<br>18	And to all the multitude, both to their wives, and to their children of both sexes, vict- uals were given faithfully out of the things that had been sanctified.
<br>19	Also of the sons of Aaron who were in the fields and in the suburbs of each city, there were men appointed, to distribute portions to all the males, among the priests and the Levites.
<br>20	So Ezechias did all things which we have said in all Juda, and wrought that which was good, and right, and truth, before the Lord his God,
<br>21	In all the service of the house of the Lord according to the law and the ceremonies, desiring to seek his God with all his heart, and he did it and prospered.
<br>
<br>Chapter 33
<br>Manasses was twelve years old when he be- gan to reign, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem.
<br>2	And he did evil before the Lord, according
<br> 
<br>to all the abominations of the nations, which the Lord cast out before the children of Israel:
<br>3	And he turned, and built again the high places which Ezechias his father had destroyed: and he built altars to Baalim, and made groves, and he adored all the host of heaven, and wor- shipped them.
<br>4	He built also altars in the house of the Lord, whereof the Lord had said: In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever.
<br>5	And he built them for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the Lord.
<br>6	And he made his sons to pass through the fire in the valley of Benennom: he observed dreams, followed divinations, gave himself up to magic arts, had with him magicians, and en- chanters: and he wrought many evils before the Lord, to provoke him to anger.
<br>7	He set also a graven, and a molten statue in the house of God, of which God had said to David, and to Solomon his son: In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever. 8 And I will not make the foot of Israel to be removed out of the land which I have delivered to their fathers: yet so if they will take heed to do what I have commanded them, and all the law, and the ceremonies, and judgments by the
<br>hand of Moses.
<br>9	So Manasses seduced Juda, and the inhabi- tants of Jerusalem, to do evil beyond all the na- tions, which the Lord had destroyed before the face of the children of Israel.
<br>10	And the Lord spoke to his people, and they would not hearken.
<br>11	Therefore he brought upon them the cap- tains of he army of the king of the Assyrians: and they took Manasses, and carried him bound with chains and fetters to Babylon.
<br>12	And after that he was in distress he prayed
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>to the Lord his God: and did penance exceed- ingly before the God of his fathers.
<br>13	And he entreated him, and besought him earnestly: and he heard his prayer, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom, and Manasses knew that the Lord was God.
<br>14	After this he built a wall without the city of David, on the west side of Gihon in the valley, from the entering in of the gate round about to Ophel, and raised it up to a great height: and he appointed captains of the army in all the fenced cities of Juda:
<br>15	And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the Lord: the al- tars also which he had made in the mount of the house of the Lord, and in Jerusalem, and he cast them all out of the city.
<br>16	And he repaired the altar of the Lord, and sacrificed upon it victims, and peace offerings, and praise: and he commanded Juda to serve the Lord the God of Israel.
<br>17	Nevertheless the people still sacrificed in the high places to the Lord their God.
<br>18	But the rest of the acts of Manasses, and his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers that spoke to him in the name of the Lord the God of Israel, are contained in the words of the kings of Israel.
<br>19	His prayer also, and his being heard and all his sins, and contempt, and places wherein he built high places, and set up groves, and statues before he did penance, are written in the words of Hozai.
<br>20	And Manasses slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his house: and his son Amon reigned in his stead.
<br>21	Amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem.
<br>22	And he did evil in the sight of the Lord,
<br> 
<br>as Manasses his father had done: he sacrificed to all the idols which Manasses his father had made, and served them.
<br>23	And he did not humble himself before the lord, as Manasses his father had humbled him- self, but committed far greater sin.
<br>24	And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own house.
<br>25	But the rest of the multitude of the peo- ple slew them that had killed Amon, and made Josias his son king in his stead.
<br>
<br>Chapter 34
<br>Josias was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned one and thirty years in Jerusalem.
<br>2	And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the ways of David his father: he declined not, neither to the right hand, nor to the left.
<br>3	And in the eighth year of his reign, when he was yet a boy, he began to seek the God of his father David: and in the twelfth year after he began to reign, he cleansed Juda and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the idols, and the graven things.
<br>4	And they broke down before him the altars of Baalim, and demolished the idols that had been set upon them: and he cut down the groves and the graven things, and broke them in pieces: and strewed the fragments upon the graves of them that had sacrificed to them.
<br>5	And he burnt the bones of the priests on the altars of the idols, and he cleansed Juda and Jerusalem.
<br>6	And in the cities of Manasses, and of Ephraim, and of Simeon, even to Nephtali he demolished all.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>7	And when he had destroyed the altars, and the groves, and had broken the idols in pieces, and had demolished all profane temples throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem.
<br>8	Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had cleansed the land, and the temple of the Lord, he sent Saphan the son of Elselias, and Maasias the governor of the city, Joha the son of Joachaz the recorder, to repair the house of the Lord his God.
<br>9	And they came to Helcias the high priest: and received of him the money which had been brought into the house of the Lord, and which the Levites and porters had gathered together from Manasses, and Ephraim, and all the rem- nant of Israel, and from all Juda, and Benjamin, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
<br>10	Which they delivered into the hands of them that were over the workmen in the house of the Lord, to repair the temple, and mend all that was weak.
<br>11	But they gave it to the artificers, and to the masons, to buy stones out of the quarries, and timber for the couplings of the building, and to rafter the houses, which the kings of Juda had destroyed.
<br>12	And they did all faithfully. Now the over- seers of the workmen were Jahath and Abdias of the sons of Merari, Zacharias and Mosollam of the sons of Caath, who hastened the work: all Levites skilful to play on instruments.
<br>13	But over them that carried burdens for divers uses, were scribes, and masters of the number of the Levites, and porters.
<br>14	Now when they carried out the money that had been brought into the temple of the Lord, Helcias the priest found the book of the law of the Lord, by the hand of Moses.
<br>15	And he said to Saphan the scribe: I have
<br> 
<br>found the book of the law in the house of the Lord: and he delivered it to him.
<br>16	But he carried the book to the king, and told him, saying: Lo, all that thou hast commit- ted to thy servants, is accomplished.
<br>17	They have gathered together the silver that was found in the house of the Lord: and it is given to the overseers of the artificers, and of the workmen, for divers works.
<br>18	Moreover Helcias the priest gave me this book. And he read it before the king.
<br>19	And when he had heard the words of the law, he rent his garments:
<br>20	And he commanded Helcias, and Ahicam the son of Saphan, and Abdon the son of Micha, and Saphan the scribe, and Asaa the king’s ser- vant, saying:
<br>21	Go, and pray to the Lord for me, and for the remnant of Israel, and Juda, concerning all the words of this book, which is found: for the great wrath of the Lord hath fallen upon us, be- cause our fathers have not kept the words of the Lord, to do all things that are written in this book.
<br>22	And Helcias and they that were sent with him by the king, went to Olda the prophetess, the wife of Sellum the son of Thecuath, the son of Hasra keeper of the wardrobe: who dwelt in Jerusalem in the Second part: and they spoke to her the words above mentioned.
<br>23	And she answered them: Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: Tell the man that sent you to me:
<br>24	Thus saith the Lord: Behold I will bring evils upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, and all the curses that are written in this book which they read before the king of Juda.
<br>25	Because they have forsaken me, and have sacrificed to strange gods, to provoke me to wrath with all the works of their hands, therefore
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>my wrath shall fail upon this place, and shall not be quenched.
<br>26	But as to the king of Juda that sent you to beseech the Lord, thus shall you say to him: Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: Because thou hast heard the words of this book,
<br>27	And thy heart was softened, and thou hast humbled thyself in the sight of God for the things that are spoken against this place, and the in- habitants of Jerusalem, and reverencing my face, hast rent thy garments, and wept before me: I also have heard thee, saith the Lord.
<br>28	For now I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be brought to thy tomb in peace: and thy eyes shall not see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and the inhabitants thereof. They therefore reported to the king all that she had said.
<br>29	And he called together all the ancients of Juda and Jerusalem.
<br>30	And went up to the house of the Lord, and all the men of Juda, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the priests and the Levites, and all the people from the least to the greatest.   And the king read in their hearing, in the house of the Lord, all the words of the book.
<br>31	And standing up in his tribunal, he made a covenant before the Lord to walk after him, and keep his commandments, and testimonies, and justifications with all his heart, and with all his soul, and to do the things that were written in that book which he had read.
<br>32	And he adjured all that were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin to do the same: and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of the Lord the God of their fathers.
<br>33	And Josias took away all the abominations out of all the countries of the children of Israel and made all that were left in Israel, to serve the Lord their God. As long as he lived they
<br> 
<br>departed not from the Lord the God of their fa- thers.
<br>
<br>Chapter 35
<br>And Josias kept a phase to the Lord in Jerusalem, and it was sacrificed on the four- teenth day of the first month.
<br>2	And he set the priests in their offices, and exhorted them to minister in the house of the Lord.
<br>3	And he spoke to the Levites, by whose in- struction all Israel was sanctified to the Lord, saying: Put the ark in the sanctuary of the tem- ple, which Solomon the son of David king of Is- rael built: for you shall carry it no more: but minister now to the Lord your God, and to his people Israel.
<br>4	And prepare yourselves by your houses, and families according to your courses, as David king of Israel commanded, and Solomon his son hath written.
<br>5	And serve ye in the sanctuary by the families and companies of Levi.
<br>6	And being sanctified kill the phase, and pre- pare your brethren, that they may do according to the words which the Lord spoke by the hand of Moses.
<br>7	And Josias gave to all the people that were found there in the solemnity of the phase, of lambs and of kids of the flocks, and of other small cattle thirty thousand, and of oxen three thou- sand, all these were of the king’s substance.
<br>8	And his princes willingly offered what they had vowed, both to the people and to the priests and the Levites. Moreover Helcias, and Zacharias, and Jahiel rulers of the house of the Lord, gave to the priests to keep the phase two thousand six hundred small cattle, and three
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>hundred oxen.
<br>9	And Chonenias, and Semeias and Nathanael, his brethren, and Hasabias, and Jehiel, and Jozabad princes of the Levites, gave to the rest of the Levites to celebrate the phase five thousand small cattle, and five hundred oxen.
<br>10	And the ministry was prepared, and the priests stood in their office: the Levites also in their companies, according to the king’s com- mandment.
<br>11	And the phase was immolated: and the priests sprinkled the blood with their hand, and the Levites flayed the holocausts:
<br>12	And they separated them, to give them by the houses and families of every one, and to be offered to the Lord, as it is written in the book of Moses, and with the oxen they did in like manner.
<br>13	And they roasted the phase with fire, ac- cording to that which is written in the law: but the victims of peace offerings they boiled in caldrons, and kettles, and pots, and they dis- tributed them speedily among all the people.
<br>14	And afterwards they made ready for them- selves, and for the priests: for the priests were busied in offering of holocausts and the fat until night, wherefore the Levites prepared for them- selves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron last. 15 And the singers the sons of Asaph stood in their order, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Idithun, the prophets of the king: and the porters kept guard at every gate, so as not to depart one moment from their service, and therefore their brethren
<br>the Levites prepared meats for them.
<br>16	So all the service of the Lord was duly ac- complished that day, both in keeping the phase and offering holocausts upon the altar of the Lord, according to the commandment of king
<br> 
<br>Josias.
<br>17	And the children of Israel that were found there, kept the phase at that time, and the feast of unleavened seven days.
<br>18	There was no phase like to this in Israel, from the days of Samuel the prophet: neither did any of all the kings of Israel keep such a phase as Josias kept, with the priests, and the Levites, and all Juda, and Israel that were found, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
<br>19	In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josias was this phase celebrated.
<br>20	After that Josias had repaired the temple, Nechao king of Egypt came up to fight in Char- camis by the Euphrates: and Josias went out to meet him.
<br>21	But he sent messengers to him, saying: What have I to do with thee, O king of Juda? I come not against thee this day, but I fight against another house, to which God hath commanded me to go in haste: forbear to do against God, who is with me, lest he kill thee.
<br>22	Josias would not return, but prepared to fight against him, and hearkened not to the words of Nechao from the mouth of God, but went to fight in the field of Mageddo.
<br>23	And there he was wounded by the archers, and he said to his servants: Carry me out of the battle, for I am grievously wounded.
<br>24	And they removed him from the char- iot into another, that followed him after the manner of kings, and they carried him away to Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in the monument of his fathers, and all Juda and Jerusalem mourned for him,
<br>25	Particularly Jeremias: whose lamentations for Josias all the singing men and singing women repeat unto this day, and it became like a law in Israel: Behold it is found written in the Lamen- tations.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>26	Now the rest of the acts of Josias and of his mercies, according to what was commanded by the law of the Lord:
<br>27	And his works first and last, are written in the book of the kings of Juda and Israel.
<br>
<br>Chapter 36
<br>Then the people of the land took Joachaz the son of Josias, and made him king instead of his father in Jerusalem.
<br>2	Joachaz was three and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.
<br>3	And the king of Egypt came to Jerusalem, and deposed him, and condemned the land in a hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.
<br>4	And he made Eliakim his brother king in his stead, over Juda and Jerusalem: and he turned his name to Joakim: but he took Joachaz with him and carried him away into Egypt.
<br>5	Joakim was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did evil before the Lord his God.
<br>6	Against him came up Nabuchodonosor king of the Chaldeans, and led him bound in chains into Babylon.
<br>7	And he carried also thither the vessels of the Lord, and put them in his temple.
<br>8	But the rest of the acts of Joakim, and his abominations, which he wrought, and the things that were found in him, are contained in the book of the kings of Juda and Israel. And Joachin his son reigned in his stead.
<br>9	Joachin was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem, and he did evil in the sight of the Lord.
<br> 
<br>10	And at the return of the year, king Nabu- chodonosor sent, and brought him to Babylon, carrying away at the same time the most pre- cious vessels of the house of the Lord: and he made Sedecias his uncle king over Juda and Jerusalem.
<br>11	Sedecias was one and twenty years old when he began to reign: and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.
<br>12	And he did evil in the eyes of the Lord his God, and did not reverence the face of Jeremias the prophet speaking to him from the mouth of the Lord.
<br>13	He also revolted from king Nabu- chodonosor, who had made him swear by God: and he hardened his neck and his heart, from returning to the Lord the God of Israel.
<br>14	Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people wickedly transgressed according to all the abominations of the Gentiles: and they de- filed the house of the Lord, which he had sanc- tified to himself in Jerusalem.
<br>15	And the Lord the God of their fathers sent to them, by the hand of his messengers, rising early, and daily admonishing them: because he spared his people and his dwelling place.
<br>16	But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused the prophets, until the wrath of the Lord arose against his people, and there was no remedy.
<br>17	For he brought upon them the king of the Chaldeans, and he slew their young men with the sword in the house of his sanctuary, he had no compassion on young man, or maiden, old man or even him that stooped for age, but he delivered them all into his hands.
<br>18	And all the vessels of the house of Lord, great and small, and the treasures of the temple and of the king, and of the princes he carried away to Babylon.
<br> 
<br>
<br>19	And the enemies set fire to the house of God, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem, burnt all the towers, and what soever was pre- cious they destroyed.
<br>20	Whosoever escaped the sword, was led into Babylon, and there served the king and his sons, till the reign of the king of Persia,
<br>21	That the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremias might be fulfilled, and the land might keep her sabbaths: for all the days of the deso- lation she kept a sabbath, till the seventy years were expired.
<br>22	But in the first year of Cyrus king of the Persians, to fulfil the word of the Lord,  which he had spoken by the mouth of Jeremias, the Lord stirred up the heart of Cyrus, king of the Persians: who commanded it to be proclaimed through all his kingdom, and by writing also, saying:
<br>23	Thus saith Cyrus king of the Persians: All the kingdoms of the earth hath the Lord the God of heaven given to me, and he hath charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judea: who is there among you of all his people? The Lord his God be with him, and let him go up.

<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>In the first year of Cyrus king of the Persians, that the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremias might be fulfilled, the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of the Persians: and he made a proclamation throughout all his king- dom, and in writing also, saying:
<br>2	Thus saith Cyrus king of the Persians: The Lord the God of heaven hath given to me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he hath charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judea.
<br>3	Who is there among you of all his peo- ple?     His God be with him.     Let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judea, and build the house of the Lord the God of Israel: he is the God that is in Jerusalem.
<br>4	And let all the rest in all places wheresoever they dwell, help him every man from his place, with silver and gold, and goods, and cattle, be- sides that which they offer freely to the temple of God, which is in Jerusalem.
<br>5	Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Juda and Benjamin, and the priests, and Levites, and every one whose spirit God had raised up, to go up to build the temple of the Lord, which was in Jerusalem.
<br>6	And all they that were round about, helped their hands with vessels of silver, and gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with furniture, be- sides what they had offered on their own accord.
<br> 
<br>
<br>7	And king Cyrus brought forth vessels of the temple of the Lord, which Nabuchodonosor had taken from Jerusalem, and had put them in the temple of his god.
<br>8	Now Cyrus king of Persia brought them forth by the hand of Mithridates the son of Gazabar, and numbered them to Sassabasar the prince of Juda.
<br>9	And this is the number of them: thirty bowls of gold, a thousand bowls of silver, nine and twenty knives, thirty cups of gold,
<br>10	Silver cups of a second sort, four hundred and ten: other vessels a thousand.
<br>11	All the vessels of gold and silver, five thou- sand four hundred: all these Sassabasar brought with them that came up from the captivity of Babylon to Jerusalem.
<br>
<br>Chapter 2
<br>Now these are the children of the province, that went out of the captivity, which Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon had carried away to Babylon, and who returned to Jerusalem and Juda, every man to his city.

<br>68	And some of the chief of the fathers, when they came to the temple of the Lord, which is in Jerusalem, offered freely to the house of the Lord to build it in its place.
<br>69	According to their ability, they gave to- wards the expenses of the work, sixty-one thou- sand solids of gold, five thousand pounds of sil- ver, and a hundred garments for the priests.
<br>70	So the priests and the Levites, and some of the people, and the singing men, and the porters, and the Nathinites dwelt in their cities, and all Israel in their cities.
<br>
<br>Chapter 3
<br>And now the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel were in their cities: and the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem.
<br>2	And Josue the son of Josedec rose up, and
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>his brethren the priests, and Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, and his brethren, and they built the altar of the God of Israel that they might offer holocausts upon it, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.
<br>3	And they set the altar of God upon its bases, while the people of the lands round about put them in fear, and they offered upon it a holocaust to the Lord morning and evening.
<br>4	And they kept the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and offered the holocaust every day orderly according to the commandment, the duty of the day in its day.
<br>5	And afterwards the continual holocaust, both on the new moons, and on all the solem- nities of the Lord, that were consecrated, and on all in which a freewill offering was made to the Lord.
<br>6	From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer holocausts to the Lord: but the temple of God was not yet founded.
<br>7	And they gave money to hewers of stones and to masons: and meat and drink, and oil to the Sidonians and Tyrians, to bring cedar trees from Libanus to the sea of Joppe, according to the orders which Cyrus king of the Persians had given them.
<br>8	And in the second year of their coming to the temple of God in Jerusalem, the second month, Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, and Josue the son of Josedec, and the rest of their brethren the priests, and the Levites, and all that were come from the captivity to Jerusalem began, and they appointed Levites from twenty years old and up- ward, to hasten forward the work of the Lord.
<br>9	Then Josue and his sons and his brethren, Cedmihel, and his sons, and the children of Juda, as one man, stood to hasten them that did the work in the temple of God: the sons of Henadad, and their sons, and their brethren the Levites.
<br> 
<br>10	And when the masons laid the foundations of the temple of the Lord, the priests stood in their ornaments with trumpets: and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise God by the hands of David king of Israel.
<br>11	And they sung together hymns, and praise to the Lord: because he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever towards Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, praising the Lord, because the foundations of the temple of the Lord were laid.
<br>12	But many of the priests and the Levites, and the chief of the fathers and the ancients that had seen the former temple; when they had the foundation of this temple before their eyes, wept with a loud voice: and many shouting for joy, lifted up their voice.
<br>13	So that one could not distinguish the voice of the shout of joy, from the noise of the weeping of the people: for one with another the people shouted with a loud shout, and the voice was heard afar off.
<br>
<br>Chapter 4
<br>Now the enemies of Juda and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity were building a temple to the Lord the God of Israel.
<br>2 And they came to Zorobabel, and the chief of the fathers, and said to them: Let us build with you, for we seek your God as ye do: behold we have sacrificed to him, since the days of Asor Haddan king of Assyria, who brought us hither. 3 But Zorobabel, and Josue, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel said to them: You have nothing to do with us to build a house to our God, but we ourselves alone will build to the Lord our God, as Cyrus king of the Persians
<br>hath commanded us.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>4	Then the people of the land hindered the hands of the people of Juda, and troubled them in building.
<br>5	And they hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their design all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of the Persians.
<br>6	And in the reign of Assuerus, in the be- ginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Juda and Jerusalem.
<br>7	And in the days of Artaxerxes, Beselam, Mithridates, and Thabeel, and the rest that were in the council wrote to Artaxerxes king of the Persians: and the letter of accusation was writ- ten in Syrian, and was read in the Syrian tongue.
<br>8	Reum Beelteem, and Samsai the scribe wrote a letter from Jerusalem to king Artax- erxes, in this manner:
<br>9	Reum Beelteem, and Samsai the scribe and the rest of their counsellors, the Dinites, and the Apharsathacites, the Therphalites, the Aphar- sites, the Erchuites, the Babylonians, the Su- sanechites, the Dievites, and the Elamites,
<br>10	And the rest of the nations, whom the great and glorious Asenaphar brought over: and made to dwell in the cities of Samaria and in the rest of the countries of this side of the river in peace. 11 (This is the copy of the letter, which they sent to him:) To Artaxerxes the king, thy ser- vants, the men that are on this side of the river,
<br>send greeting.
<br>12	Be it known to the king, that the Jews, who came up from thee to us, are come to Jerusalem a rebellious and wicked city, which they are build- ing, setting up the ramparts thereof and repair- ing the walls.
<br>13	And now be it known to the king, that if this city be built up, and the walls thereof repaired, they will not pay tribute nor toll, nor yearly revenues, and this loss will fall upon the
<br> 
<br>kings.
<br>14	But we remembering the salt that we have eaten in the palace, and because we count it a crime to see the king wronged, have therefore sent and certified the king,
<br>15	That search may be made in the books of the histories of thy fathers, and thou shalt find written in the records: and shalt know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful to the kings and provinces, and that wars were raised therein of old time: for which cause also the city was destroyed.
<br>16	We certify the king, that if this city be built, and the walls thereof repaired, thou shalt have no possession on this side of the river.
<br>17	The king sent word to Reum Beelteem and Samsai the scribe, and to the rest that were in their council, inhabitants of Samaria, and to the rest beyond the river, sending greeting and peace.
<br>18	The accusation, which you have sent to us, hath been plainly read before me,
<br>19	And I commanded: and search hath been made, and it is found, that this city of old time hath rebelled against kings, and seditions and wars have been raised therein.
<br>20	For there have been powerful kings in Jerusalem, who have had dominion over all the country that is beyond the river: and have re- ceived tribute, and toll and revenues.
<br>21	Now therefore hear the sentence: Hinder those men, that this city be not built, till further orders be given by me.
<br>22	See that you be not negligent in executing this, lest by little and little the evil grow to the hurt of the kings.
<br>23	Now the copy of the edict of king Artax- erxes was read before Reum Beelteem, and Sam- sai the scribe, and their counsellors: and they went up in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews, and
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>hindered them with arm and power.
<br>24	Then the work of the house of the Lord in Jerusalem was interrupted, and ceased till the second year of the reign of Darius king of the Persians.
<br>
<br>Chapter 5
<br>Now Aggeus the prophet, and Zacharias the son of Addo, prophesied to the Jews that were in Judea and Jerusalem, in the name of the God of Israel.
<br>2	Then rose up Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, and Josue the son of Josedec, and began to build the temple of God in Jerusalem, and with them were the prophets of God helping them.
<br>3	And at the same time came to them Thathanai, who was governor beyond the river, and Stharbuzanai, and their counsellors: and said thus to them: Who hath given you coun- sel to build this house, and to repair the walls thereof?
<br>4	In answer to which we gave them the names of the men who were the promoters of that build- ing.
<br>5	But the eye of their God was upon the an- cients of the Jews, and they could not hinder them. And it was agreed that the matter should be referred to Darius, and then they should give satisfaction concerning that accusation.
<br>6	The copy of the letter that Thathanai gover- nor of the country beyond the river, and Sthar- buzanai, and his counsellors the Arphasachites, who dwelt beyond the river, sent to Darius the king.
<br>7	The letter which they sent him, was written thus: To Darius the king all peace.
<br>8	Be it known to the king, that we went to the province of Judea, to the house of the great God,
<br> 
<br>which they are building with unpolished stones, and timber is laid in the walls: and this work is carried on diligently and advanceth in their hands.
<br>9	And we asked those ancients, and said to them thus: Who hath given you authority to build this house, and to repair these walls?
<br>10	We asked also of them their names,that we might give thee notice: and we have written the names of the men that are the chief among them. 11 And they answered us in these words, say- ing: We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are building a temple that was built these many years ago, and which a great
<br>king of Israel built and set up.
<br>12 But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven to wrath, he delivered them into the hands of Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon the Chaldean: and he destroyed this house, and carried away the people to Babylon. 13 But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon, king Cyrus set forth a decree, that this
<br>house of God should be built.
<br>14	And the vessels also of gold and silver of the temple of God, which Nabuchodonosor had taken out of the temple, that was in Jerusalem, and had brought them to the temple of Babylon, king Cyrus brought out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered to one Sassabasar, whom also he appointed governor,
<br>15	And said to him: Take these vessels, and go, and put them in the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be built in its place.
<br>16	Then came this same Sassabasar, and laid the foundations of the temple of God in Jerusalem, and from that time until now it is in building, and is not yet finished.
<br>17	Now therefore if it seem good to the king, let him search in the king’s library, which is in
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Babylon, whether it hath been decreed by Cyrus the king, that the house of God in Jerusalem should be built, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.
<br>
<br>Chapter 6
<br>Then king Darius gave orders, and they searched in the library of the books that were laid up in Babylon,
<br>2	And there was found in Ecbatana, which is a castle in the province of Media, a book in which this record was written.
<br>3	In the first year of Cyrus the king: Cyrus the king decreed, that the house of God should be built, which is in Jerusalem, in the place where they may offer sacrifices, and that they lay the foundations that may support the height of threescore cubits, and the breadth of three- score cubits,
<br>4	Three rows of unpolished stones, and so rows of new timber: and the charges shall be given out of the king’s house.
<br>5	And also let the golden and silver vessels of the temple of God, which Nabuchodonosor took out of the temple of Jerusalem, and brought to Babylon, be restored, and carried back to the temple of Jerusalem to their place, which also were placed in the temple of God.
<br>6	Now therefore Thathanai, governor of the country beyond the river, Stharbuzanai, and your counsellors the Apharsachites, who are be- yond the river, depart far from them,
<br>7	And let that temple of God be built by the governor of the Jews, and by their ancients, that they may build that house of God in its place.
<br>8	I also have commanded what must be done by those ancients of the Jews, that the house of God may be built, to wit, that of the king’s
<br> 
<br>chest, that is, of the tribute that is paid out of the country beyond the river, the charges be dili- gently given to those men, lest the work be hin- dered.
<br>9	And if it shall be necessary, let calves also, and lambs, and kids, for holocausts to the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the custom of the priests that are in Jerusalem, be given them day by day, that there be no com- plaint in any thing.
<br>10	And let them offer oblations to the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his children.
<br>11	And I have made a decree: That if any whosoever, shall alter this commandment, a beam be taken from his house, and set up, and he be nailed upon it, and his house be confiscated. 12 And may the God, that hath caused his name to dwell there, destroy all kingdoms, and the people that shall put out their hand to re- sist, and to destroy the house of God, that is in Jerusalem. I Darius have made the decree, which
<br>I will have diligently complied with.
<br>13	So then Thathanai, governor of the coun- try beyond the river, and Stharbuzanai, and his counsellors diligently executed what Darius the king had commanded.
<br>14	And the ancients of the Jews built, and prospered according to the prophecy of Aggeus the prophet, and of Zacharias the son of Addo: and they built and finished, by the command- ment of the God of Israel, and by the command- ment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes kings of the Persians.
<br>15	And they were finishing this house of God, until the third day of the month of Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of king Darius. 16 And the children of Israel, the priests and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity kept the dedication of the house of God
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>with joy.
<br>17	And they offered at the dedication of the house of God, a hundred calves, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs, and for a sin offering for all Israel twelve he goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.
<br>18	And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses over the works of God in Jerusalem, as it is written in the book of Moses.
<br>19	And the children of Israel of the captivity kept the phase, on the fourteenth day of the first month.
<br>20	For all the priests and the Levites were purified as one man: all were clean to kill the phase for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and themselves.
<br>21	And the children of Israel that were re- turned from captivity, and all that had separated themselves from the filthiness of the nations of the earth to them, to seek the Lord the God of Israel, did eat.
<br>22	And they kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy, for the Lord had made them joyful, and had turned the heart of the king of Assyria to them, that he should help their hands in the work of the house of the Lord the God of Israel.
<br>
<br>Chapter 7
<br>
<br>Now after these things in the reign of Artaxerxes king of the Persians, Esdras the son of Saraias, the son of Azarias, the son of Helcias,
<br>2	The son of Sellum, the son of Sadoc, the son of Achitob,
<br>3	The son of Amarias, the son of Azarias, the son of Maraioth,
<br> 
<br>4	The son of Zarahias, the son of Ozi, the son of Bocci,
<br>5	The son of Abisue, the son of Phinees, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, the priest from the beginning.
<br>6	This Esdras went up from Babylon, and he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which the Lord God had given to Israel: and the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of the Lord his God upon him.
<br>7	And there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the children of the priests, and of the children of the Levites, and of the singing men, and of the porters, and of the Nathinites to Jerusalem in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king.
<br>8	And they came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, in the seventh year of the king.
<br>9	For upon the first day of the first month he began to go up from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month he came to Jerusalem according to the good hand of his God upon him. 10 For Esdras had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord, and to do and to teach in
<br>Israel the commandments and judgment.
<br>11	And this is the copy of the letter of the edict, which king Artaxerxes gave to Esdras the priest, the scribe instructed in the words and commandments of the Lord, and his ceremonies in Israel.
<br>12	Artaxerxes king of kings to Esdras the priest, the most learned scribe of the law of the God of heaven, greeting.
<br>13	It is decreed by me, that all they of the people of Israel, and of the priests and of the Levites in my realm, that are minded to go into Jerusalem, should go with thee.
<br>14	For thou art sent from before the king, and his seven counsellors, to visit Judea and Jerusalem according to the law of thy God,
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>which is in thy hand.
<br>15	And to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counsellors have freely offered to the God of Israel, whose tabernacle is in Jerusalem. 16 And all the silver and gold that thou shalt find in all the province of Babylon, and that the people is willing to offer, and that the priests shall offer of their own accord to the house of
<br>their God, which is in Jerusalem,
<br>17	Take freely, and buy diligently with this money, calves, rams, lambs, with the sacrifices and libations of them, and offer them upon the altar of the temple of your God, that is in Jerusalem.
<br>18	And if it seem good to thee, and to thy brethren to do any thing with the rest of the silver and gold, do it according to the will of your God.
<br>19	The vessels also, that are given thee for the sacrifice of the house of thy God, deliver thou in the sight of God in Jerusalem.
<br>20	And whatsoever more there shall be need of for the house of thy God, how much soever thou shalt have occasion to spend, it shall be given out of the treasury, and the king’s exchequer, and by me.
<br>21	I Artaxerxes the king have ordered and de- creed to all the keepers of the public chest, that are beyond the river, that whatsoever Esdras the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall require of you, you give it without delay,
<br>22	Unto a hundred talents of silver, and unto a hundred cores of wheat, and unto a hundred bates of wine, and unto a hundred bates of oil, and salt without measure.
<br>23	All that belongeth to the rites of the God of heaven, let it be given diligently in the house of the God of heaven: lest his wrath should be enkindled against the realm of the king, and of his sons.
<br> 
<br>24	We give you also to understand concerning all the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nathinites, and min- isters of the house of this God, that you have no authority to impose toll or tribute, or custom upon them.
<br>25	And thou Esdras according to the wisdom of thy God, which is in thy hand, appoint judges and magistrates, that may judge all the people, that is beyond the river, that is, for them who know the law of thy God, yea and the ignorant teach ye freely.
<br>26	And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the king diligently, judgment shall be executed upon him, either unto death, or unto banishment, or to the confiscation of goods, or at least to prison.
<br>27	Blessed be the Lord the God of our fathers, who hath put this in the king’s heart, to glorify the house of the Lord, which is in Jerusalem,
<br>28	And hath inclined his mercy toward me before the king and his counsellors, and all the mighty princes of the king: and I being strength- ened by the hand of the Lord my God, which was upon me, gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up with me.
<br>
<br>Chapter 8
<br>Now these are the chief of families, and the ge- nealogy of them, who came up with me from Babylon in the reign of Artaxerxes the king.
<br>2	Of the sons of Phinees, Gersom. Of the sons of Ithamar, Daniel. Of the sons of David, Hat- tus.
<br>3	Of the sons of Sechenias, the son of Pharos, Zacharias, and with him were numbered a hun- dred and fifty men.
<br>4	Of the sons of Phahath Moab, Eleoenai the
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>son of Zareha, and with him two hundred men.
<br>5	Of the sons of Sechenias, the son of Ezechiel, and with him three hundred men.
<br>6	Of the sons of Adan, Abed the son of Jonathan, and with him fifty men.
<br>7	Of the sons of Alam, Isaias the son of Athalias, and with him seventy men.
<br>8	Of the sons of Saphatia: Zebodia the son of Michael, and with him eighty men.
<br>9	Of the sons of Joab, Obedia the son of Jahiel, and with him two hundred and eighteen men.
<br>10	Of the sons of Selomith, the son of Josphia, and with him a hundred and sixty men.
<br>11	Of the sons of Bebai, Zacharias the son of Bebai: and with him eight and twenty men.
<br>12	Of the sons of Azgad, Joanan the son of Eccetan, and with him a hundred and ten men. 13 Of the sons of Adonicam, who were the last: and these are their names: Eliphelet, and
<br>Jehiel, and Samaias, and with them sixty men.
<br>14	Of the sons of Begui, Uthai and Zachur, and with them seventy men.
<br>15	And I gathered them together to the river, which runneth down to Ahava, and we stayed there three days: and I sought among the people and among the priests for the sons of Levi, and found none there.
<br>16	So I sent Eliezer, and Ariel, and Semeias, and Elnathan, and Jarib, and another Elnathan, and Nathan, and Zacharias, and Mosollam, chief men: and Joiarib, and Elnathan, wise men.
<br>17	And I sent them to Eddo, who is chief in the place of Chasphia, and I put in their mouth the words that they should speak to Eddo, and his brethren the Nathinites in the place of Chasphia, that they should bring us ministers of the house of our God.
<br>18	And by the good hand of our God upon us, they brought us a most learned man of the sons
<br> 
<br>of Moholi the son of Levi the son of Israel, and Sarabias and his sons, and his brethren eighteen, 19 And Hasabias, and with him Isaias of the sons of Merari, and his brethren, and his sons
<br>twenty.
<br>20	And of the Nathinites, whom David, and the princes gave for the service of the Levites, Nathinites two hundred and twenty: all these were called by their names.
<br>21	And I proclaimed there a fast by the river Ahava, that we might afflict ourselves before the Lord our God, and might ask of him a right way for us and for our children, and for all our sub- stance.
<br>22	For I was ashamed to ask the king for aid and for horsemen, to defend us from the enemy in the way: because we had said to the king: The hand of our God is upon all them that seek him in goodness: and his power and strength, and wrath upon all them that forsake him.
<br>23	And we fasted, and besought our God for this: and it fell out prosperously unto us.
<br>24	And I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sarabias, and Hasabias, and with them ten of their brethren,
<br>25	And I weighed unto them the silver and gold, and the vessels consecrated for the house of our God, which the king and his counsellors, and his princes, and all Israel, that were found had offered.
<br>26	And I weighed to their hands six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and a hundred vessels of silver, and a hundred talents of gold,
<br>27	And twenty cups of gold, of a thousand solids, and two vessels of the best shining brass, beautiful as gold.
<br>28	And I said to them: You are the holy ones of the Lord, and the vessels are holy, and the silver and gold, that is freely offered to the Lord the God of our fathers.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>29	Watch ye and keep them, till you deliver them by weight before the chief of the priests, and of the Levites, and the heads of the families of Israel in Jerusalem, into the treasure of the house of the Lord.
<br>30	And the priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver and gold, and the vessels, to carry them to Jerusalem to the house of our God.
<br>31	Then we set forward from the river Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month to go to Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon us, and delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way.
<br>32	And we came to Jerusalem, and we stayed there three days.
<br>33	And on the fourth day the silver and the gold, and the vessels were weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Urias the priest, and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinees, and with them Jozabad the son of Josue, and Noadaia the son of Benoi, Levites.
<br>34	According to the number and weight of ev- erything: and all the weight was written at that time.
<br>35	Moreover the children of them that had been carried away that were come out of the captivity, offered holocausts to the God of Is- rael, twelve calves for all the people of Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, and twelve he goats for sin: all for a holocaust to the Lord.
<br>36	And they gave the king’s edicts to the lords that were from the king’s court, and the gover- nors beyond the river, and they furthered the people and the house of God.
<br> 
<br>Chapter 9
<br>And after these things were accomplished, the princes came to me, saying: The people of Israel, and the priests and Levites have not separated themselves from the people of the lands, and from their abominations,   namely, of the Chanaanites, and the Hethites, and the Pherezites, and the Jebusites, and the Am- monites, and the Moabites, and the Egyptians, and the Amorrhites.
<br>2	For they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons, and they have mingled the holy seed with the people of the lands. And the hand of the princes and mag- istrates hath been first in this transgression.
<br>3	And when I had heard this word, I rent my mantle and my coat, and plucked off the hairs of my head and my beard, and I sat down mourn- ing.
<br>4	And there were assembled to me all that feared the God of Israel, because of the trans- gression of those that were come from the cap- tivity, and I sat sorrowful, until the evening sac- rifice.
<br>5	And at the evening sacrifice I rose up from my affliction, and having rent my mantle and my garment, I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands to the Lord my God,
<br>6	And said: My God I am confounded and ashamed to lift up my face to thee: for our iniq- uities are multiplied over our heads, and our sins are grown up even unto heaven,
<br>7	From the days of our fathers: and we our- selves also have sinned grievously unto this day, and for our iniquities we and our kings, and our priests have been delivered into the hands of the kings of the lands, and to the sword, and to cap- tivity, and to spoil, and to confusion of face, as it is at this day.
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>8	And now as a little, and for a moment has our prayer been made before the Lord our God, to leave us a remnant, and give us a pin in his holy place, and that our God would enlighten our eyes, and would give us a little life in our bondage.
<br>9	For we are bondmen, and in our bondage our God hath not forsaken us, but hath extended mercy upon us before the king of the Persians, to give us life, and to set up the house of our God, and to rebuild the desolations thereof, and to give us a fence in Juda and Jerusalem.
<br>10	And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken thy command- ments,
<br>11	Which thou hast commanded by the hand of thy servants the prophets, saying: The land which you go to possess, is an unclean land, ac- cording to the uncleanness of the people, and of other lands, with their abominations, who have filled it from mouth to mouth with their filth.
<br>12	Now therefore give not your daughters to their sons, and take not their daughters for your sons, and seek not their peace, nor their prosper- ity for ever: that you may be strengthened, and may eat the good things of the land, and may have your children your heirs for ever.
<br>13	And after all that is come upon us, for our most wicked deeds, and our great sin, seeing that thou our God hast saved us from our iniquity, and hast given us a deliverance as at this day,
<br>14	That we should not turn away, nor break thy commandments, nor join in marriage with the people of these abominations. Art thou an- gry with us unto utter destruction, not to leave us a remnant to be saved?
<br>15	O Lord God of Israel, thou art just: for we remain yet to be saved as at this day. Behold we are before thee in our sin, for there can be no standing before thee in this matter.

<br>Chapter 10
<br>Now when Esdras was thus praying, and beseech- ing, and weeping, and lying before the temple of God, there was gathered to him of Israel an ex- ceeding great assembly of men and women and children, and the people wept with much lamen- tation.
<br>2	And Sechenias the son of Jehiel of the sons of Elam answered, and said to Esdras: We have sinned against our God, and have taken strange wives of the people of the land: and now if there be repentance in Israel concerning this,
<br>3	Let us make a covenant with the Lord our God, to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the will of the Lord, and of them that fear the commandment of the Lord our God: let it be done according to the law.
<br>4	Arise, it is thy part to give orders, and we will be with thee: take courage, and do it.
<br>5	So Esdras arose, and made the chiefs of the priests and of the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they would do according to this word, and they swore.
<br>6	And Esdras rose up from before the house of God, and went to the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliasib, and entered in thither: he ate no bread, and drank no water: for he mourned for the transgression of them that were come out of the captivity.
<br>7	And proclamation was made in Juda and Jerusalem to all the children of the captiv- ity, that they should assemble together into Jerusalem.
<br>8	And that whosoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the ancients, all his substance should be taken away, and he should be cast out of the company of them that were returned from cap-
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
<br>tivity.
<br>9	Then all the men of Juda, and Ben- jamin gathered themselves together to Jerusalem within three days, in the ninth month, the twen- tieth day of the month: and all the people sat in the street of the house of God, trembling because of the sin, and the rain.
<br>10	And Esdras the priest stood up, and said to them: You have transgressed, and taken strange wives, to add to the sins of Israel.
<br>11	And now make confession to the Lord the God of your fathers, and do his pleasure, and separate yourselves from the people of the land, and from your strange wives.
<br>12	And all the multitude answered and said with a loud voice: According to thy word unto us, so be it done.
<br>13	But as the people are many, and it is time of rain, and we are not able to stand without, and it is not a work of one day or two, (for we have exceedingly sinned in this matter,)
<br>14	Let rulers be appointed in all the multi- tude: and in all our cities, let them that have taken strange wives come at the times appointed, and with them the ancients and the judges of every city, until the wrath of our God be turned away from us for this sin.
<br>15	Then Jonathan the son of Azahel, and Jaasia the son of Thecua were appointed over this, and Mesollam and Sebethai, Levites, helped them:
<br>16	And the children of the captivity did so. And Esdras the priest, and the men heads of the families in the houses of their fathers, and all by their names, went and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.
<br>17	And they made an end with all the men that had taken strange wives by the first day of the first month.
<br>18	And there were found among the sons of
<br> 
<br>the priests that had taken strange wives: Of the sons of Josue the son of Josedec, and his brethren, Maasia, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Godolia.
<br>19	And they gave their hands to put away their wives, and to offer for their offence a ram of the flock.
<br>20	And of the sons of Emmer, Hanani, and Zebedia.
<br>21	And of the sons of Harim, Maasia, and Elia, and Semeia, and Jehiel, and Ozias.
<br>22	And of the sons of Pheshur, Elioenai, Maa- sia, Ismael, Nathanael, Jozabed, and Elasa.
<br>23	And of the sons of the Levites, Jozabed, and Semei, and Celaia, the same is Calita, Phataia, Juda, and Eliezer.
<br>24	And of the singing men, Elisiab: and of the porters, Sellum, and Telem, and Uri.
<br>25	And of Israel, of the sons of Pharos, Re- meia, and Jezia, and Melchia, and Miamin, and Eliezer, and Melchia, and Banea.
<br>26	And of the sons of Elam, Mathania, Zacharias, and Jehiel, and Abdi, and Jerimoth, and Elia.
<br>27	And of the sons of Zethua, Elioenai, Elia- sib, Mathania, Jerimuth, and Zabad, and Azi- aza.
<br>28	And of the sons of Babai, Johanan, Hana- nia, Zabbai, Athalai:
<br>29	And of the sons of Bani, Mosollam, and Melluch, and Adaia, Jasub, and Saal, and Ramoth.
<br>30	And of the sons of Phahath, Moab, Edna, and Chalal, Banaias, and Maasias, Mathanias, Beseleel, Bennui, and Manasse.
<br>31	And of the sons of Herem, Eliezer, Josue, Melchias, Semeias, Simeon,
<br>32	Benjamin, Maloch, Samarias.
<br>33	And of the sons of Hasom, Mathanai, Mathatha, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jermai, Manasse,
<br> 
<br>
<br>Semei.
<br>34	Of the sons of Bani, Maaddi, Amram, and Uel,
<br>35	Baneas, and Badaias, Cheliau, 36 Vania, Marimuth, and Eliasib, 37 Mathanias, Mathania, and Jasi, 38 And Bani, and Bennui, Semei,
<br>39	And Salmias, and Nathan, and Adaias,
<br>40	And Mechnedebai, Sisai, Sarai, 41 Ezrel, and Selemiau, Semeria, 42 Sellum, Amaria, Joseph.
<br>43	Of the sons of Nebo, Jehiel, Mathathias, Zabad, Zabina, Jeddu, and Joel, and Banaia.
<br>44	All these had taken strange wives, and there were among them women that had borne children.

<br>Book of Nehemias
<br>
<br>
<br> 
<br>Chapter 1
<br>The words of Nehemias the son of Helchias. And it came to pass in the month of Casleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in the castle of Susa,
<br>2	That Hanani one of my brethren came, he and some men of Juda; and I asked them con- cerning the Jews, that remained and were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.
<br>3	And they said to me: They that have re- mained, and are left of the captivity there in the province, are in great affliction, and reproach: and the wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and the gates thereof are burnt with fire.
<br>4	And when I had heard these words, I sat down, and wept, and mourned for many days: and I fasted, and prayed before the face of the God of heaven.
<br>5	And I said: I beseech thee, O Lord God of heaven, strong, great, and terrible, who keepest covenant and mercy with those that love thee, and keep thy commandments:
<br>6	Let thy ears be attentive, and thy eyes open, to hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, night and day, for the chil- dren of Israel thy servants: and I confess the sins of the children of Israel, by which they have sinned against thee: I and my father’s house have sinned.
<br>7	We have been seduced by vanity, and have not kept thy commandments, and ceremonies and judgments, which thou hast commanded thy
<br> 
<br>
<br>servant Moses.
<br>8	Remember the word that thou command- edst to Moses thy servant, saying: If you shall transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations:
<br>9	But if you return to me, and keep my com- mandments, and do them, though you should be led away to the uttermost parts of the world, I will gather you from thence, and bring you back to the place which I have chosen for my name to dwell there.
<br>10	And these are thy servants, and thy people: whom thou hast redeemed by thy great strength, and by thy mighty hand.
<br>11	I beseech thee, O Lord, let thy ear be at- tentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants who desire to fear thy name: and direct thy servant this day, and give him mercy before this man. For I was the king’s cupbearer.
<br>
<br>Chapter 2
<br>And it came to pass in the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king: that wine was before him, and I took up the wine, and gave it to the king: and I was as one languishing away before his face.
<br>2	And the king said to me: Why is thy coun- tenance sad, seeing thou dost not appear to be sick? this is not without cause, but some evil, I
