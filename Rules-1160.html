<br>Democratic Republic of the Congo Relief, Security, and Democracy Promotion
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 109–456, Dec. 22, 2006, 120 Stat. 3384, provided that:
<br>"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
<br>
<br>"This Act may be cited as the 'Democratic Republic of the Congo Relief, Security, and Democracy Promotion Act of 2006'.
<br>"TITLE I—BILATERAL ACTION ON ADDRESSING URGENT NEEDS IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO
<br>"SEC. 101. FINDINGS.
<br>
<br>"Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>"(1) The National Security Strategy of the United States, dated September 17, 2002, concludes that '[i]n Africa, promise and opportunity sit side-by-side with disease, war, and desperate poverty. This threatens both a core value of the United States preserving human dignity and our strategic priority combating global terror. American interests and American principles, therefore, lead in the same direction: we will work with others for an African continent that lives in liberty, peace, and growing prosperity.'.
<br>
<br>"(2) On February 16, 2005, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency testified, 'In Africa, chronic instability will continue to hamper counterterrorism efforts and pose heavy humanitarian and peacekeeping burdens.'.
<br>
<br>"(3) According to the United States Agency for International Development, 'Given its size, population, and resources, the Congo is an important player in Africa and of long-term interest to the United States.'.
<br>
<br>"(4) The Democratic Republic of the Congo is 2,345,410 square miles (approximately ¼ the size of the United States), lies at the heart of Africa, and touches every major region of sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, a secure, peaceful, and prosperous Democratic Republic of the Congo would have a profound impact on progress throughout Africa.
<br>
<br>"(5) The most recent war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which erupted in 1998, spawned some of the world's worst human rights atrocities and drew in six neighboring countries.
<br>
<br>"(6) Despite the conclusion of a peace agreement and subsequent withdrawal of foreign forces in 2003, both the real and perceived presence of armed groups hostile to the Governments of Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi continue to serve as a major source of regional instability and an apparent pretext for continued interference in the Democratic Republic of the Congo by its neighbors.
<br>
<br>"(7) A mortality study completed in December 2004 by the International Rescue Committee found that 31,000 people were dying monthly and 3,800,000 people had died in the previous six years because of the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and resulting disintegration of the social service infrastructure, making this one of the deadliest conflicts since World War II.
<br>
<br>"(8) In 2004, Amnesty International estimated that at least 40,000 women and girls were systematically raped and tortured in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since 1998, and nearly two-thirds of ongoing abuses against women and girls are perpetrated by members of the security forces, particularly the Forces Armes de la Republique Democratique du Congo (FARDC) and the Police Nationale Congolaise (PNC).
<br>
<br>"(9) According to the Department of State, 'returning one of Africa's largest countries [the Democratic Republic of the Congo] to full peace and stability will require significant United States investments in support of national elections, the reintegration of former combatants, the return and reintegration of refugees and [internally displaced persons], establishment of central government control over vast territories, and promotion of national reconciliation and good governance'.
<br>"SEC. 102. STATEMENT OF POLICY.
<br>
<br>"It is the policy of the United States—
<br>
<br>"(1) to help promote, reinvigorate, and support the political process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in order to press all parties in the Transitional National Government and the succeeding government to implement fully and to institutionalize mechanisms, including national and international election observers, fair and transparent voter registration procedures, and a significant civic awareness and public education campaign created for the July 30, 2006, elections and future elections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to ensure that elections are carried out in a fair and democratic manner;
<br>
<br>"(2) to urge the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to recognize and act upon its responsibilities to immediately bring discipline to its security forces, hold those individuals responsible for atrocities and other human rights violations, particularly the rape of women and girls as an act of war, accountable and bring such individuals to justice;
<br>
<br>"(3) to help ensure that, once a stable national government is established in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, it is committed to multiparty democracy, open and transparent governance, respect for human rights and religious freedom, ending the violence throughout the country, promoting peace and stability with its neighbors, rehabilitating the national judicial system and enhancing the rule of law, combating corruption, instituting economic reforms to promote development, and creating an environment to promote private investment;
<br>
<br>"(4) to assist the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo as it seeks to meet the basic needs of its citizens, including security, safety, and access to health care, education, food, shelter, and clean drinking water;
<br>
<br>"(5) to support security sector reform by assisting the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to establish a viable and professional national army and police force that respects human rights and the rule of law, is under effective civilian control, and possesses a viable presence throughout the entire country, provided the Democratic Republic of the Congo meets all requirements for United States military assistance under existing law;
<br>
<br>"(6) to help expedite planning and implementation of programs associated with the disarmament, demobilization, repatriation, reintegration, and rehabilitation process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo;
<br>
<br>"(7) to support efforts of the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the United Nations Peacekeeping Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC), and other entities, as appropriate, to disarm, demobilize, and repatriate the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda and other illegally armed groups;
<br>
<br>"(8) to make all efforts to ensure that the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo—
<br>
<br>"(A) is committed to responsible and transparent management of natural resources across the country; and
<br>
<br>"(B) takes active measures—
<br>
<br>"(i) to promote economic development;
<br>
<br>"(ii) to hold accountable individuals who illegally exploit the country's natural resources; and
<br>
<br>"(iii) to implement the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative by enacting laws requiring disclosure and independent auditing of company payments and government receipts for natural resource extraction;
<br>
<br>"(9) to promote a viable civil society and to enhance nongovernmental organizations and institutions, including religious organizations, the media, political parties, trade unions, and trade and business associations, that can act as a stabilizing force and effective check on the government;
<br>
<br>"(10) to help rebuild and enhance infrastructure, communications, and other mechanisms that will increase the ability of the central government to manage internal affairs, encourage economic development, and facilitate relief efforts of humanitarian organizations;
<br>
<br>"(11) to help halt the high prevalence of sexual abuse and violence perpetrated against women and children in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and mitigate the detrimental effects from acts of this type of violence by undertaking a number of health, education, and psycho-social support programs;
<br>
<br>"(12) to work aggressively on a bilateral basis to urge governments of countries contributing troops to the United Nations Peacekeeping Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) to enact and enforce laws on trafficking in persons and sexual abuse that meet international standards, promote codes of conduct for troops serving as part of United Nations peacekeeping missions, and immediately investigate and punish citizens who are responsible for abuses in the Democratic Republic of the Congo;
<br>
<br>"(13) to assist the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo as undertakes steps to—
<br>
<br>"(A) protect internally displaced persons and refugees in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and border regions from all forms of violence, including gender-based violence and other human rights abuses;
<br>
<br>"(B) address other basic needs of vulnerable populations with the goal of allowing these conflict-affected individuals to ultimately return to their homes; and
<br>
<br>"(C) assess the magnitude of the problem of orphans from conflict and HIV/AIDS in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and work to establish a program of national support;
<br>
<br>"(14) to engage with governments working to promote peace and security throughout the Democratic Republic of the Congo and hold accountable individuals, entities, and countries working to destabilize the country; and
<br>
<br>"(15) to promote appropriate use of the forests of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in a manner that benefits the rural population in that country that depends on the forests for their livelihoods and protects national and environmental interests.
<br>"SEC. 103. BILATERAL ASSISTANCE TO THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO.
<br>
<br>"(a) Funding for Fiscal Years 2006 and 2007.—Of the amounts made available to carry out the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.), the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 [now Food for Peace Act] [7 U.S.C. 1691 et seq.] (68 Stat. 454, chapter 469), and the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.) for fiscal year 2006 and 2007, at least $52,000,000 for each such fiscal year should be allocated for bilateral assistance programs in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
<br>
<br>"(b) Future Year Funding.—It is the sense of Congress that the Department of State should submit budget requests in fiscal years 2008 and 2009 that contain increases in bilateral assistance for the Democratic Republic of the Congo that are appropriate if progress is being made, particularly cooperation by the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, toward accomplishing the policy objectives described in section 102.
<br>
<br>"(c) Coordination With Other Donor Nations.—The United States should work with other donor nations, on a bilateral and multilateral basis, to increase international contributions to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and accomplish the policy objectives described in section 102.
<br>"SEC. 104. ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO.
<br>
<br>"(a) Sense of Congress.—It is the sense of Congress that—
<br>
<br>"(1) the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo must be committed to achieving the policy objectives described in section 102 if the efforts of the United States and other members of the international community are to be effective in bringing relief, security, and democracy to the country;
<br>
<br>"(2) the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo should immediately exercise control over and discipline its armed forces, stop the mass rapes at the hands of its armed forces, and hold those responsible for these acts accountable before an appropriate tribunal;
<br>
<br>"(3) the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in collaboration with international aid agencies, should establish expert teams to assess the needs of the victims of rape and provide health, counseling, and social support services that such victims need; and
<br>
<br>"(4) the international community, through the United Nations peacekeeping mission, humanitarian and development relief, and other forms of assistance, is providing a substantial amount of funding that is giving the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo an opportunity to make progress towards accomplishing the policy objectives described in section 102, but this assistance cannot continue in perpetuity.
<br>
<br>"(b) Termination of Assistance.—It is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of State should withhold assistance otherwise available under this Act if the Secretary determines that the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is not making sufficient progress towards accomplishing the policy objectives described in section 102.
<br>"SEC. 105. WITHHOLDING OF ASSISTANCE.
<br>
<br>"The Secretary of State is authorized to withhold assistance made available under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.), other than humanitarian, peacekeeping, and counterterrorism assistance, for a foreign country if the Secretary determines that the government of the foreign country is taking actions to destabilize the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
<br>"SEC. 106. REPORT ON PROGRESS TOWARD ACCOMPLISHING POLICY OBJECTIVES.
<br>
<br>"(a) Report Required.—Not later than one year after the date of the enactment of this Act [Dec. 22, 2006], the Comptroller General of the United States shall submit to Congress a report on the progress made toward accomplishing the policy objectives described in section 102.
<br>
<br>"(b) Contents.—The report required under subsection (a) shall include—
<br>
<br>"(1) a description of any major impediments that prevent the accomplishment of the policy objectives described in section 102, including any destabilizing activities undertaken in the Democratic Republic of Congo by governments of neighboring countries;

<br>
<br>"(3) recommendations for—

<br>
<br>"(B) any additional bilateral or multilateral actions necessary to promote peace and prosperity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
<br>"SEC. 107. SPECIAL ENVOY FOR THE GREAT LAKES REGION.
<br>
<br>"Not later than 60 days after the date of the enactment of this Act [Dec. 22, 2006], the President should appoint a Special Envoy for the Great Lakes Region to help coordinate efforts to resolve the instability and insecurity in Eastern Congo.
<br>"TITLE II—MULTILATERAL ACTIONS TO ADDRESS URGENT NEEDS IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO
<br>"SEC. 201. PROMOTION OF UNITED STATES POLICY TOWARD THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO IN THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL.
<br>
<br>"The United States should use its voice and vote in the United Nations Security Council—
<br>
<br>"(1) to address exploitation at the United Nations Peacekeeping Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) by continuing to urge, when credible allegations exist, appropriate investigation of alleged perpetrators and, as necessary, prosecution of United Nations personnel responsible for sexual abuses in the Democratic Republic of the Congo;
<br>
<br>"(2) to conclude at the earliest possible date a Memorandum of Understanding relating to binding codes of conduct and programs for the prevention of sexual abuse and trafficking in persons to be undertaken by the United Nations for all countries that contribute troops to MONUC, to include the assumption of personal liability for the provision of victims assistance and child support, as appropriate, by those who violate the codes of conduct;
<br>
<br>"(3) to strengthen the authority and capacity of MONUC by—
<br>
<br>"(A) providing specific authority and obligation to prevent and effectively counter imminent threats;
<br>
<br>"(B) clarifying and strengthening MONUC's rules of engagement to enhance the protection of vulnerable civilian populations;
<br>
<br>"(C) enhancing the surveillance and intelligence-gathering capabilities available to MONUC;
<br>
<br>"(D) where consistent with United States policy, making available personnel, communications, and military assets that improve the effectiveness of robust peacekeeping, mobility, and command and control capabilities of MONUC; and
<br>
<br>"(E) providing MONUC with the authority and resources needed to effectively monitor arms trafficking and natural resource exploitation at key border posts and airfields in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo;
<br>
<br>"(4) to encourage regular visits of the United Nations Security Council to monitor the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo;
<br>
<br>"(5) to ensure that the practice of recruiting and arming children in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is immediately halted pursuant to Security Council Resolutions 1460 (2003) and 1539 (2004);
<br>
<br>"(6) to strengthen the arms embargo imposed pursuant to Security Council Resolution 1493 (2003) and ensure that violators are held accountable through appropriate measures, including the possible imposition of sanctions;
<br>
<br>"(7) to allow for the more effective protection and monitoring of natural resources in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, especially in the eastern part of the country, and for public disclosure and independent auditing of natural resource revenues to help ensure transparent and accountable management of these revenues;
<br>
<br>"(8) to press countries in the Congo region to help facilitate an end to the violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and promote relief, security, and democracy throughout the region; and
<br>
<br>"(9) to encourage the United Nations Secretary-General to become more involved in completing the policy objectives described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 102 and ensure that recent fighting in North Kivu, which displaced over 150,000 people, as well as fighting in Ituri and other areas, does not create widespread instability throughout the country.
<br>"SEC. 202. INCREASING CONTRIBUTIONS AND OTHER HUMANITARIAN AND DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE THROUGH INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS.
<br>
<br>"(a) In General.—The President should instruct the United States permanent representative or executive director, as the case may be, to the United Nations voluntary agencies, including the World Food Program, the United Nations Development Program, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and other appropriate international organizations to use the voice and vote of the United States to support additional humanitarian and development assistance for the Democratic Republic of the Congo in order to accomplish the policy objectives described in section 102.
<br>
<br>"(b) Support Contingent on Progress.—If the Secretary of State determines that the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is not making sufficient progress towards accomplishing the policy objectives described in section 102, the President shall consider withdrawing United States support for the assistance described in subsection (a) when future funding decisions are considered."

<br>Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 108–175, Dec. 12, 2003, 117 Stat. 2482, provided that:
<br>"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
<br>
<br>"This Act may be cited as the 'Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003'.
<br>"SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
<br>
<br>"Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>"(1) On June 24, 2002, President Bush stated 'Syria must choose the right side in the war on terror by closing terrorist camps and expelling terrorist organizations'.
<br>
<br>"(2) United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373 (September 28, 2001) mandates that all states 'refrain from providing any form of support, active or passive, to entities or persons involved in terrorist acts', take 'the necessary steps to prevent the commission of terrorist acts', and 'deny safe haven to those who finance, plan, support, or commit terrorist acts'.
<br>
<br>"(3) The Government of Syria is currently prohibited by United States law from receiving United States assistance because it has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism, as determined by the Secretary of State for purposes of [former] section 6(j)(1) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. App. 2405(j)(1)) [former 50 U.S.C. 4605(j)(1)] and other relevant provisions of law.
<br>
<br>"(4) Although the Department of State lists Syria as a state sponsor of terrorism and reports that Syria provides 'safe haven and support to several terrorist groups', fewer United States sanctions apply with respect to Syria than with respect to any other country that is listed as a state sponsor of terrorism.
<br>
<br>"(5) Terrorist groups, including Hizballah, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine—General Command, maintain offices, training camps, and other facilities on Syrian territory, and operate in areas of Lebanon occupied by the Syrian armed forces and receive supplies from Iran through Syria.
<br>
<br>"(6) United Nations Security Council Resolution 520 (September 17, 1982) calls for 'strict respect of the sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and political independence of Lebanon under the sole and exclusive authority of the Government of Lebanon through the Lebanese Army throughout Lebanon'.
<br>
<br>"(7) Approximately 20,000 Syrian troops and security personnel occupy much of the sovereign territory of Lebanon exerting undue influence upon its government and undermining its political independence.
<br>
<br>"(8) Since 1990 the Senate and House of Representatives have passed seven bills and resolutions which call for the withdrawal of Syrian armed forces from Lebanon.
<br>
<br>"(9) On March 3, 2003, Secretary of State Colin Powell declared that it is the objective of the United States to 'let Lebanon be ruled by the Lebanese people without the presence of [the Syrian] occupation army'.
<br>
<br>"(10) Large and increasing numbers of the Lebanese people from across the political spectrum in Lebanon have mounted peaceful and democratic calls for the withdrawal of the Syrian Army from Lebanese soil.
<br>
<br>"(11) Israel has withdrawn all of its armed forces from Lebanon in accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 425 (March 19, 1978), as certified by the United Nations Secretary General.
<br>
<br>"(12) Even in the face of this United Nations certification that acknowledged Israel's full compliance with Security Council Resolution 425, Syrian- and Iranian-supported Hizballah continues to attack Israeli outposts at Shebaa Farms, under the pretense that Shebaa Farms is territory from which Israel was required to withdraw by Security Counsel Resolution 425, and Syrian- and Iranian-supported Hizballah and other militant organizations continue to attack civilian targets in Israel.
<br>
<br>"(13) Syria will not allow Lebanon—a sovereign country—to fulfill its obligation in accordance with Security Council Resolution 425 to deploy its troops to southern Lebanon.
<br>
<br>"(14) As a result, the Israeli-Lebanese border and much of southern Lebanon is under the control of Hizballah, which continues to attack Israeli positions, allows Iranian Revolutionary Guards and other militant groups to operate freely in the area, and maintains thousands of rockets along Israel's northern border, destabilizing the entire region.
<br>
<br>"(15) On February 12, 2003, Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet stated the following with respect to the Syrian- and Iranian-supported Hizballah: '[A]s an organization with capability and worldwide presence [it] is [al Qaeda's] equal if not a far more capable organization * * * [T]hey're a notch above in many respects, in terms of in their relationship with the Iranians and the training they receive, [which] puts them in a state-sponsored category with a potential for lethality that's quite great.'.
<br>
<br>"(16) In the State of the Union address on January 29, 2002, President Bush declared that the United States will 'work closely with our coalition to deny terrorists and their state sponsors the materials, technology, and expertise to make and deliver weapons of mass destruction'.
<br>
<br>"(17) The Government of Syria continues to develop and deploy short- and medium-range ballistic missiles.
<br>
<br>"(18) According to the December 2001 unclassified Central Intelligence Agency report entitled 'Foreign Missile Developments and the Ballistic Missile Threat through 2015', 'Syria maintains a ballistic missile and rocket force of hundreds of FROG rockets, Scuds, and SS–21 SRBMs [and] Syria has developed [chemical weapons] warheads for its Scuds'.
<br>
<br>"(19) The Government of Syria is pursuing the development and production of biological and chemical weapons and has a nuclear research and development program that is cause for concern.
<br>
<br>"(20) According to the Central Intelligence Agency's 'Unclassified Report to Congress on the Acquisition of Technology Relating to Weapons of Mass Destruction and Advanced Conventional Munitions', released January 7, 2003: '[Syria] already holds a stockpile of the nerve agent sarin but apparently is trying to develop more toxic and persistent nerve agents. Syria remains dependent on foreign sources for key elements of its [chemical weapons] program, including precursor chemicals and key production equipment. It is highly probable that Syria also is developing an offensive [biological weapons] capability.'.
<br>
<br>"(21) On May 6, 2002, the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, John Bolton, stated: 'The United States also knows that Syria has long had a chemical warfare program. It has a stockpile of the nerve agent sarin and is engaged in research and development of the more toxic and persistent nerve agent VX. Syria, which has signed but not ratified the [Biological Weapons Convention], is pursuing the development of biological weapons and is able to produce at least small amounts of biological warfare agents.'.
<br>
<br>"(22) According to the Central Intelligence Agency's 'Unclassified Report to Congress on the Acquisition of Technology Relating to Weapons of Mass Destruction and Advanced Conventional Munitions', released January 7, 2003: 'Russia and Syria have approved a draft cooperative program on cooperation on civil nuclear power. In principal, broader access to Russian expertise provides opportunities for Syria to expand its indigenous capabilities, should it decide to pursue nuclear weapons.'.
<br>
<br>"(23) Under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (21 UST 483), which entered force on March 5, 1970, and to which Syria is a party, Syria has undertaken not to acquire or produce nuclear weapons and has accepted full scope safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency to detect diversions of nuclear materials from peaceful activities to the production of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.
<br>
<br>"(24) Syria is not a party to the Chemical Weapons Convention or the Biological Weapons Convention, which entered into force on April 29, 1997, and on March 26, 1975, respectively.
<br>
<br>"(25) Syrian President Bashar Assad promised Secretary of State Powell in February 2001 to end violations of Security Council Resolution 661, which restricted the sale of oil and other commodities by Saddam Hussein's regime, except to the extent authorized by other relevant resolutions, but this pledge was never fulfilled.
<br>
<br>"(26) Syria's illegal imports and transshipments of Iraqi oil during Saddam Hussein's regime earned Syria $50,000,000 or more per month as Syria continued to sell its own Syrian oil at market prices.
<br>
<br>"(27) Syria's illegal imports and transshipments of Iraqi oil earned Saddam Hussein's regime $2,000,000 per day.
<br>
<br>"(28) On March 28, 2003, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld warned: '[W]e have information that shipments of military supplies have been crossing the border from Syria into Iraq, including night-vision goggles * * * These deliveries pose a direct threat to the lives of coalition forces. We consider such trafficking as hostile acts, and will hold the Syrian government accountable for such shipments.'.
<br>
<br>"(29) According to Article 23(1) of the United Nations Charter, members of the United Nations are elected as nonpermanent members of the United Nations Security Council with 'due regard being specially paid, in the first instance to the contribution of members of the United Nations to the maintenance of international peace and security and to other purposes of the Organization'.
<br>
<br>"(30) Despite Article 23(1) of the United Nations Charter, Syria was elected on October 8, 2001, to a 2-year term as a nonpermanent member of the United Nations Security Council beginning January 1, 2002, and served as President of the Security Council during June 2002 and August 2003.
<br>
<br>"(31) On March 31, 2003, the Syrian Foreign Minister, Farouq al-Sharra, made the Syrian regime's intentions clear when he explicitly stated that 'Syria's interest is to see the invaders defeated in Iraq'.
<br>
<br>"(32) On April 13, 2003, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld charged that 'busloads' of Syrian fighters entered Iraq with 'hundreds of thousands of dollars' and leaflets offering rewards for dead American soldiers.
<br>
<br>"(33) On September 16, 2003, the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, John Bolton, appeared before the Subcommittee on the Middle East and Central Asia of the Committee on International Relations [now Committee on Foreign Affairs] of the House of Representatives, and underscored Syria's 'hostile actions' toward coalition forces during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Under Secretary Bolton added that: 'Syria allowed military equipment to flow into Iraq on the eve of and during the war. Syria permitted volunteers to pass into Iraq to attack and kill our service members during the war, and is still doing so * * * [Syria's] behavior during Operation Iraqi Freedom underscores the importance of taking seriously reports and information on Syria's WMD capabilities.'.
<br>
<br>"(34) During his appearance before the Committee on International Relations of the House of Representatives on September 25, 2003, Ambassador L. Paul Bremer, III, Administrator of the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq, stated that out of the 278 third-country nationals who were captured by coalition forces in Iraq, the 'single largest group are Syrians'.
<br>"SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.
<br>
<br>"It is the sense of Congress that—
<br>
<br>"(1) the Government of Syria should immediately and unconditionally halt support for terrorism, permanently and openly declare its total renunciation of all forms of terrorism, and close all terrorist offices and facilities in Syria, including the offices of Hamas, Hizballah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine—General Command;
<br>
<br>"(2) the Government of Syria should—
<br>
<br>"(A) immediately and unconditionally stop facilitating transit from Syria to Iraq of individuals, military equipment, and all lethal items, except as authorized by the Coalition Provisional Authority or a representative, internationally recognized Iraqi government;
<br>
<br>"(B) cease its support for 'volunteers' and terrorists who are traveling from and through Syria into Iraq to launch attacks; and
<br>
<br>"(C) undertake concrete, verifiable steps to deter such behavior and control the use of territory under Syrian control;
<br>
<br>"(3) the Government of Syria should immediately declare its commitment to completely withdraw its armed forces, including military, paramilitary, and security forces, from Lebanon, and set a firm timetable for such withdrawal;
<br>
<br>"(4) the Government of Lebanon should deploy the Lebanese armed forces to all areas of Lebanon, including South Lebanon, in accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 520 (September 17, 1982), in order to assert the sovereignty of the Lebanese state over all of its territory, and should evict all terrorist and foreign forces from southern Lebanon, including Hizballah and the Iranian Revolutionary Guards;
<br>
<br>"(5) the Government of Syria should halt the development and deployment of medium- and long-range surface-to-surface missiles and cease the development and production of biological and chemical weapons;
<br>
<br>"(6) the Governments of Lebanon and Syria should enter into serious unconditional bilateral negotiations with the Government of Israel in order to realize a full and permanent peace;
<br>
<br>"(7) the United States should continue to provide humanitarian and educational assistance to the people of Lebanon only through appropriate private, nongovernmental organizations and appropriate international organizations, until such time as the Government of Lebanon asserts sovereignty and control over all of its territory and borders and achieves full political independence, as called for in United Nations Security Council Resolution 520; and
<br>
<br>"(8) as a violator of several key United Nations Security Council resolutions and as a nation that pursues policies which undermine international peace and security, Syria should not have been permitted to join the United Nations Security Council or serve as the Security Council's President, and should be removed from the Security Council.
<br>"SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY.
<br>
<br>"It is the policy of the United States that—
<br>
<br>"(1) Syria should bear responsibility for attacks committed by Hizballah and other terrorist groups with offices, training camps, or other facilities in Syria, or bases in areas of Lebanon occupied by Syria;
<br>
<br>"(2) the United States will work to deny Syria the ability to support acts of international terrorism and efforts to develop or acquire weapons of mass destruction;
<br>
<br>"(3) the Secretary of State will continue to list Syria as a state sponsor of terrorism until Syria ends its support for terrorism, including its support of Hizballah and other terrorist groups in Lebanon and its hosting of terrorist groups in Damascus, and comes into full compliance with United States law relating to terrorism and United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373 (September 28, 2001);
<br>
<br>"(4) the full restoration of Lebanon's sovereignty, political independence, and territorial integrity is in the national security interest of the United States;
<br>
<br>"(5) Syria is in violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 520 (September 17, 1982) through its continued occupation of Lebanese territory and its encroachment upon Lebanon's political independence;
<br>
<br>"(6) Syria's obligation to withdraw from Lebanon is not conditioned upon progress in the Israeli-Syrian or Israeli-Lebanese peace process but derives from Syria's obligation under Security Council Resolution 520;
<br>
<br>"(7) Syria's acquisition of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs threaten the security of the Middle East and the national security interests of the United States;
<br>
<br>"(8) Syria will be held accountable for any harm to Coalition armed forces or to any United States citizen in Iraq if the government of Syria is found to be responsible due to its facilitation of terrorist activities and its shipments of military supplies to Iraq; and
<br>
<br>"(9) the United States will not provide any assistance to Syria and will oppose multilateral assistance for Syria until Syria ends all support for terrorism, withdraws its armed forces from Lebanon, and halts the development and deployment of weapons of mass destruction and medium- and long-range surface-to-surface ballistic missiles.

<br>"It is the policy of the United States to support the people of Zimbabwe in their struggle to effect peaceful, democratic change, achieve broad-based and equitable economic growth, restore the rule of law, reconstruct and rebuild Zimbabwe, and come to terms with the past through a process of genuine reconciliation that acknowledges past human rights abuses and orders inquiries into disappearances, including the disappearance of human rights activists, such as Patrick Nabanyama, Itai Dzamara, and Paul Chizuze.

<br>
<br>"In this Act:
<br>
<br>"(1) International financial institutions.—The term 'international financial institutions' means the multilateral development banks and the International Monetary Fund.

<br>
<br>"(a) Findings.—Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>"(1) Through economic mismanagement, undemocratic practices, and the private appropriation of public assets, the Government of Zimbabwe has rendered itself ineligible to participate in International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and International Monetary Fund programs, which would otherwise be providing substantial resources to assist in the recovery and modernization of Zimbabwe's economy. The people of Zimbabwe have thus been denied the economic and democratic benefits envisioned by the donors to such programs, including the United States.
<br>
<br>"(2) In September 1999 the IMF suspended its support under a 'Stand By Arrangement', approved the previous month, for economic adjustment and reform in Zimbabwe.

<br>"(4) In May 2000, the IDA suspended all other new lending to the Government of Zimbabwe.
<br>
<br>"(5) In September 2000, the IDA suspended disbursement of funds for ongoing projects under previously-approved loans, credits, and guarantees to the Government of Zimbabwe.

<br>
<br>"(2) Multilateral debt relief and other financial assistance.—It is the sense of Congress that, upon receipt by the appropriate congressional committees of a certification described in subsection (d), the Secretary of the Treasury should—
<br>
<br>"(A) direct the United States executive director of each multilateral development bank to support efforts to reevaluate plans to restructure, rebuild, reschedule, or eliminate Zimbabwe's sovereign debt held by that bank and provide an analysis based on reasonable financial options to achieve those goals; and
<br>
<br>"(B) direct the United States executive director of each international financial institution to which the United States is a member to propose to undertake financial and technical support for Zimbabwe, especially support that is intended to promote Zimbabwe's economic recovery and development, the stabilization of the Zimbabwean currency, and the viability of Zimbabwe's democratic institutions.
<br>
<br>"(c) Multilateral Financing Restriction.—Until the President makes the certification described in subsection (d), and except as may be required to meet basic human needs or for good governance, the Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States executive director to each international financial institution to oppose and vote against—
<br>
<br>"(1) any extension by the respective institution of any loan, credit, or guarantee to the Government of Zimbabwe; or

<br>
<br>"(2) Election or pre-election conditions.—Either of the following two conditions is satisfied:
<br>
<br>"(A) Presidential election.—Zimbabwe has held a presidential election that is widely accepted as free and fair by independent international monitors, and the president-elect is free to assume the duties of the office.
<br>
<br>"(B) Pre-election conditions.—In the event the certification is made before the presidential election takes place, the Government of Zimbabwe has sufficiently improved the pre-election environment to a degree consistent with accepted international standards for security and freedom of movement and association.
<br>
<br>"(3) Commitment to equitable, legal, and transparent land reform.—The Government of Zimbabwe has demonstrated a commitment to an equitable, legal, and transparent land reform program.
<br>
<br>"(4) Military and national police subordinate to civilian government.—The Zimbabwean Armed Forces, the National Police of Zimbabwe, and other state security forces are responsible to and serve the elected civilian government.
<br>
<br>"(e) Waiver.—The President may waive the provisions of subsection (b)(1) or subsection (c), if the President determines that it is in the national interest of the United States to do so.

<br>
<br>"(1) $20,000,000 is authorized to be available to provide the assistance described in subsection (a)(2); and

<br>African Conflict Resolution
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 103–381, Oct. 19, 1994, 108 Stat. 3513, provided that:
<br>"SECTION. 1. SHORT TITLE.
<br>
<br>"This Act may be cited as the 'African Conflict Resolution Act'.
<br>"SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF POLICY.
<br>
<br>"(a) Findings.—The Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>"(1) It is in the national interest of the United States to help build African capability in conflict resolution. A relatively small investment of assistance in promoting African conflict resolution—
<br>
<br>"(A) would reduce the enormous human suffering which is caused by wars in Africa;
<br>
<br>"(B) would help the United States avoid huge future expenditures necessitated by Somalia-like humanitarian disasters; and
<br>
<br>"(C) would reduce the need for United Nations intervention as African institutions develop the ability to resolve African conflicts.
<br>
<br>"(2) Africa, to a greater extent than any other continent, is afflicted by war. Africa has been marred by more than 20 major civil wars since 1960. Rwanda, Somalia, Angola, Sudan, Liberia, and Burundi are among those countries that have recently suffered serious armed conflict.
<br>
<br>"(3) In the last decade alone, between 2,000,000 and 4,000,000 Africans have died because of war. There were 5,200,000 refugees and 13,100,000 displaced people in Africa in 1993.
<br>
<br>"(4) Millions more Africans are currently at risk of war-related death. Looming or ongoing conflicts in Zaire, Angola, Sudan, Rwanda, and other countries threaten Africa's future.
<br>
<br>"(5) War has caused untold economic and social damage to the countries of Africa. Food production is impossible in conflict areas, and famine often results. Widespread conflict has condemned many of Africa's children to lives of misery and, in certain cases, has threatened the existence of traditional African cultures.
<br>
<br>"(6) Conflict and instability in Africa, particularly in large, potentially rich countries such as Angola, Sudan, and Zaire, deprive the global economy of resources and opportunities for trade and investment. Peace in these countries could make a significant contribution to global economic growth, while creating new opportunities for United States businesses.
<br>
<br>"(7) Excessive military expenditures threaten political and economic stability in Africa while diverting scarce resources from development needs. Demobilization and other measures to reduce the size of African armies, and civilian control of the military under the rule of law are in the interest of international security and economic development.
<br>
<br>"(8) Conflict prevention, mediation, and demobilization are prerequisites to the success of development assistance programs. Nutrition and education programs, for example, cannot succeed in a nation at war. Billions of dollars of development assistance have been virtually wasted in war-ravaged countries such as Liberia, Somalia, and Sudan.
<br>
<br>"(9) Africans have a long tradition of informal mediation. This tradition should be built upon to create effective institutions through which Africans can resolve African conflicts.
<br>
<br>"(10) The effectiveness of U.S. support for conflict resolution programs requires coordination and collaboration with multilateral institutions and other bilateral donors.
<br>
<br>"(11) African institutions are playing an active role in conflict resolution and mediation utilizing the experience of elder statesmen. Groups such as the All African Council of Churches have assisted in defusing conflicts. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has sought to address the conflict in Liberia by deploying an African peacekeeping force. The Southern African states have been working to prevent a crisis in Lesotho. The Intergovernmental Authority on Desertification and Drought (IGADD) has been engaged in attempting to resolve the conflict in Sudan.
<br>
<br>"(12) The Organization of African Unity, under the leadership of Secretary General Salim Salim, has established a conflict resolution mechanism and has been active in mediation and conflict resolution in several African countries.
<br>
<br>"(b) United States Policy.—The Congress declares, therefore, that a key goal for United States foreign policy should be to help institutionalize conflict resolution capability in Africa.
<br>"SEC. 3. IMPROVING THE CONFLICT RESOLUTION CAPABILITIES OF THE ORGANIZATION OF AFRICAN UNITY.
<br>
<br>"(a) Authorization of Assistance.—The President is authorized to provide assistance to strengthen the conflict resolution capability of the Organization of African Unity, as follows:
<br>
<br>"(1) Funds may be provided to the Organization of African Unity for use in supporting its conflict resolution capability, including providing technical assistance.
<br>
<br>"(2) Funds may be used for expenses of sending individuals with expertise in conflict resolution to work with the Organization of African Unity.
<br>
<br>"(b) Funding.—Of the foreign assistance funds that are allocated for sub-Saharan Africa, not less than $1,500,000 for each of the fiscal years 1995 through 1998 should be used to carry out subsection (a).
<br>"SEC. 4. IMPROVING CONFLICT RESOLUTION CAPABILITIES OF MULTILATERAL SUBREGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS IN AFRICA.
<br>
<br>"(a) Authorization of Assistance.—The President is authorized to provide assistance to strengthen the conflict resolution capabilities of subregional organizations established by countries in sub-Saharan Africa, as follows:
<br>
<br>"(1) Funds may be provided to such organizations for use in supporting their conflict resolution capability, including providing technical assistance.
<br>
<br>"(2) Funds may be used for the expenses of sending individuals with expertise in conflict resolution to work with such organizations.
<br>
<br>"(b) Funding.—Of the foreign assistance funds that are allocated for sub-Saharan Africa, such sums as may be necessary for each of the fiscal years 1995 through 1998 may be used to carry out subsection (a).
<br>"SEC. 5. IMPROVING CONFLICT RESOLUTION CAPABILITIES OF NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS.
<br>
<br>"(a) Authorization of Assistance.—The President is authorized to provide assistance to nongovernmental organizations that are engaged in mediation and reconciliation efforts in sub-Saharan Africa.
<br>
<br>"(b) Funding.—Of the foreign assistance funds that are allocated for sub-Saharan Africa, such sums as may be necessary for each of the fiscal years 1995 and 1996 should be used to carry out subsection (a).
<br>"SEC. 6. AFRICAN DEMOBILIZATION AND RETRAINING PROGRAM.
<br>
<br>"(a) Authorization of Assistance.—In order to facilitate reductions in the size of the armed forces of countries of sub-Saharan Africa, the President is authorized to—
<br>

<br>
<br>"(2) provide assistance for the reintegration of demobilized military personnel into civilian society through activities such as retraining for civilian occupations, creation of income-generating opportunities, their reintegration into agricultural activities, and the transportation to the home areas of such personnel.
<br>
<br>"(b) Funding.—Of the foreign assistance funds that are allocated for sub-Saharan Africa, $25,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 1995 and 1996 should be used for the assistance described in subsection (a), if conditions permit.
<br>
<br>"(c) Civilian Involvement.—The President is also authorized to promote civilian involvement in the planning and organization of demobilization and reintegration activities.
<br>"SEC. 7. TRAINING FOR AFRICANS IN CONFLICT RESOLUTION AND PEACEKEEPING.
<br>
<br>"(a) Authorization.—The President is authorized to establish a program to provide education and training in conflict resolution and peacekeeping for civilian and military personnel of countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
<br>
<br>"(b) Funding.—Of the funds made available under chapter 5 of part II of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [22 U.S.C. 2347 et seq.], such sums as may be necessary for each of the fiscal years 1995 and 1996 should be used for the purposes of subsection (a).
<br>"SEC. 8. PLAN FOR UNITED STATES SUPPORT FOR CONFLICT RESOLUTION AND DEMOBILIZATION IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA.
<br>
<br>"(a) In General.—Pursuant to the provisions of sections 3 through 7, the President should develop an integrated long-term plan, which incorporates local perspectives, to provide support for the enhancement of conflict resolution capabilities and demobilization activities in sub-Saharan Africa.
<br>
<br>"(b) Contents of Plan.—Such plan should include:
<br>
<br>"(1) The type, purpose, amount, and duration of assistance that is planned to be provided to conflict resolution units in sub-Saharan Africa.
<br>
<br>"(2) The type and amount of assistance that is planned to be provided for the demobilization of military personnel of countries of sub-Saharan Africa, including—
<br>

<br>
<br>"(B) a list of other countries and international organizations that are providing assistance for such demobilization.
<br>
<br>"(3) The type and amount of assistance that is planned to be provided to nongovernmental organizations that are engaged in mediation and reconciliation efforts in sub-Saharan Africa.

<br>
<br>(b) The United States recognizes the responsibility of all nations to protect their populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity, including when implemented by means of sexual violence. The United States further recognizes that sexual violence, when used or commissioned as a tactic of war or as a part of a widespread or systematic attack against civilians, can exacerbate and prolong armed conflict and impede the restoration of peace and security.

<br>
<br>(b) Participation in peace processes and decisionmaking. The United States Government will improve the prospects for inclusive, just, and sustainable peace by promoting and strengthening women's rights and effective leadership and substantive participation in peace processes, conflict prevention, peacebuilding, transitional processes, and decisionmaking institutions in conflict-affected environments.
<br>
<br>(c) Protection from violence. The United States Government will strengthen its efforts to prevent—and protect women and children from—harm, exploitation, discrimination, and abuse, including sexual and gender-based violence and trafficking in persons, and to hold perpetrators accountable in conflict-affected environments.
<br>
<br>(d) Conflict prevention. The United States Government will promote women's roles in conflict prevention, improve conflict early-warning and response systems through the integration of gender perspectives, and invest in women and girls' health, education, and economic opportunity to create conditions for stable societies and lasting peace.
<br>
<br>(e) Access to relief and recovery. The United States Government will respond to the distinct needs of women and children in conflict-affected disasters and crises, including by providing safe, equitable access to humanitarian assistance.
