<br>(b) Construction of Federal pavilion
<br>
<br>(1) In developing a plan under subsection (a)(3) of this section the Secretary of Commerce shall consider whether the plan should include the construction of a Federal pavilion. If the Secretary of Commerce determines that a Federal pavilion should be constructed, he shall request the Administrator of General Services (hereinafter in this section referred to as the "Administrator") to determine, in consultation with such Secretary, whether there is a federally endorsed need for a permanent structure in the area of the exposition. If the Administrator determines that any such need exists—
<br>
<br>(A) the Administrator shall fully document such determination, including the identification of the need, and shall transmit such documentation to the Secretary of Commerce;
<br>
<br>(B) the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Administrator, shall design a pavilion which satisfies the federally endorsed needs for—
<br>
<br>(i) participation in the exposition; and
<br>
<br>(ii) permanent use of such pavilion after the termination of participation in the exposition; and
<br>
<br>(C) the Secretary of Commerce shall determine whether the Federal Government should be deeded a satisfactory site for the Federal pavilion in fee simple, free of all liens and encumbrances, as a condition of participation in the exposition.
<br>
<br>(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, if the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Administrator determines that no design of a Federal pavilion will satisfy both needs described in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, the Secretary shall design a temporary Federal pavilion.
<br>(c) Authorization of appropriations for Federal pavilion
<br>
<br>The enactment of a specific authorization of appropriations shall be required—
<br>
<br>(1) to construct a Federal pavilion in accordance with the plan prepared pursuant to subsection (a)(3) of this section;
<br>
<br>(2) if the Federal pavilion is not temporary, to modify such Federal pavilion after termination of participation in the exposition if modification is necessary to adapt such pavilion for use by the Federal Government to satisfy a need described in subsection (b)(1)(B)(ii) of this section; and
<br>
<br>(3) if the Federal pavilion is temporary, to dismantle, demolish, or otherwise dispose of such Federal pavilion after termination of Federal participation in the exposition.
<br>(d) Requisites and temporary nature of Federal pavilion
<br>
<br>For the purposes of this section—
<br>
<br>(1) a Federal pavilion shall be considered to satisfy both needs described in subsection (b)(1)(B) of this section if the Federal pavilion which satisfies the needs described in paragraph (1)(B)(i) of such subsection can be modified after completion of the exposition to satisfy the needs described in paragraph (1)(B)(ii) of such subsection, provided that such modification shall cost no more than the expense of demolition, dismantling, or other disposal, or if the cost is higher, it shall be no more than 50 per centum of the original cost of the construction of the pavilion; and
<br>
<br>(2) a Federal pavilion is temporary if the Federal pavilion is designed to satisfy the minimum needs of the Federal Government described in subsection (b)(1)(B)(i) of this section and is intended for disposal by the Federal Government after the termination of participation in the exposition.

<br>(b) Investments by Secretary of Treasury in authorized obligations; issuance of obligations and special obligations; conditions of acquisition
<br>
<br>It shall be the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury (hereafter referred to as the "Secretary") to invest such portion of the Fund as is not, in the judgment of the Commission, required to meet current withdrawals. Such investment may be made only in interest-bearing obligations of the United States, in obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States, in interest-bearing obligations of Japan, or in obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by Japan. For such purposes, the obligations may be acquired (1) on original issue at the issue price, or (2) by purchase of outstanding obligations at the market price. The purposes for which obligations of the United States may be issued under chapter 31 of title 31, are hereby extended to authorize the issuance at par of special obligations exclusively to the Fund. Such special obligations shall bear interest at a rate equal to the average rate of interest, computed as to the end of the calendar month next preceding the date of such issue, borne by all marketable interest-bearing obligations of the United States issued during the preceding two years then forming part of the public debt; except that where such average rate is not a multiple of one-eight of 1 per centum, the rate of interest of such special obligations shall be the multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum next lower than such average rate. Such special obligations shall be issued only if the Secretary determines that the purchase of other interest-bearing obligations of the United States, or of obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States on original issue or at the market price, is not in the public interest.
<br>(c) Sale of obligations; redemption of special obligations
<br>
<br>Any obligation acquired by the Fund (except special obligations issued exclusively to the Fund) may be sold by the Secretary at the market price, and such special obligations may be redeemed at par plus accrued interest.
<br>(d) Credit to Fund of interest on, and proceeds from sale or redemption of, any obligations held in Fund
<br>
<br>The interest on, and the proceeds from the sale or redemption of, any obligations held in the Fund shall be credited to and form a part of the Fund.
<br>(e) Payments for implementation of programs and necessary expenses of Commission; appropriation of amounts; exceptions
<br>
<br>In accordance with section 2905(4) of this title, the Secretary shall pay out of the Fund such amounts, including expenses of the Commission, as the Commission considers necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter; except that amounts in the Fund, other than amounts which have been appropriated and amounts received (including amounts earned as interest on, and proceeds from the sale or redemption of, obligations purchased with amounts received) by the Commission pursuant to sections 2905(2) and (3) of this title, shall be subject to the appropriation process.

<br>§3101. Congressional statement of findings and declaration of purpose
<br>(a) Findings
<br>
<br>The Congress finds and declares that—
<br>
<br>(1) the United States Government is presently authorized to collect limited amounts of information on United States investment abroad and foreign investment in the United States;
<br>
<br>(2) international investment has increased rapidly within recent years;
<br>
<br>(3) such investment significantly affects the economies of the United States and other nations;
<br>
<br>(4) international efforts to obtain information on the activities of multinational enterprises and other international investors have accelerated recently;
<br>
<br>(5) the potential consequences of international investment cannot be evaluated accurately because the United States Government lacks sufficient information on such investment and its actual or possible effects on the national security, commerce, employment, inflation, general welfare, and foreign policy of the United States;
<br>
<br>(6) accurate and comprehensive information on international investment is needed by the Congress to develop an informed United States policy on such investment;
<br>
<br>(7) United States service industries engaged in interstate and foreign commerce account for a substantial part of the labor force and gross national product of the United States economy, and such commerce is rapidly increasing;
<br>
<br>(8) international trade and services is an important issue for international negotiations and deserves priority in the attention of governments, international agencies, negotiators, and the private sector; and
<br>
<br>(9) existing estimates of international investment and trade in services, collected under existing legal authority, are limited in scope and are based on outdated statistical bases, reports, and information which are insufficient for policy formulation and decisionmaking.
<br>(b) Purpose
<br>
<br>It is therefore the purpose of this chapter to provide clear and unambiguous authority for the President to collect information on international investment and United States foreign trade in services, whether directly or by affiliates, including related information necessary for assessing the impact of such investment and trade, to authorize the collection and use of information on direct investments owned or controlled directly or indirectly by foreign governments or persons, and to provide analyses of such information to the Congress, the executive agencies, and the general public. It is the intent of the Congress that information which is collected from the public under this chapter be obtained with a minimum burden on business and other respondents and with no unnecessary duplication of effort, consistent with the national interest in obtaining comprehensive and reliable information on international investment and trade in services.
<br>(c) Nonrestraint and nondeterrence of investment
<br>
<br>Nothing in this chapter is intended to restrain or deter foreign investment in the United States, United States investment abroad, or trade in services.

<br>§3141. Congressional findings
<br>
<br>The Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>(1) The United States Government collects substantial amounts of information from foreign owned or controlled business enterprises or affiliates operating in the United States.
<br>
<br>(2) Additional analysis and presentation of this information is desirable to assist the public debate on the issue of foreign direct investments in the United States.
<br>
<br>(3) Information collected from foreign owned or controlled firms by the Bureau of Economic Analysis has serious analytical limitations because it is largely collected on an "enterprise" basis that does not permit an adequate analysis by industry groupings.
<br>
<br>(4) Statistical and analytic comparisons of the performance of foreign owned or controlled businesses operating within the United States with other business enterprises operating within the same industry can be accomplished under sections 3101(b) and 3104(c) of this title, and under Executive Order Numbered 11961, without the need to collect additional information, by sharing with other authorized Government agencies the employer identification numbers maintained by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.
<br>
<br>(5) Public disclosures of confidential business information collected by the United States Government relating to international direct investment flows could cause serious damage to the accuracy of the statistical data base.
<br>
<br>(6) The Government Accountability Office may have limited access to Government data on foreign direct investment.
