<br>Editorial Notes
<br>Codification
<br>
<br>Section, as added by Pub. L. 115–282, is based on acts June 15, 1917, ch. 30, title II, §1, 40 Stat. 220; Aug. 9, 1950, ch. 656, §1, 64 Stat. 427; Sept. 26, 1950, ch. 1049, §2(b), 64 Stat. 1038; Pub. L. 96–70, title III, §3302(a), Sept. 27, 1979, 93 Stat. 498; Pub. L. 104–208, div. C, title VI, §649, Sept. 30, 1996, 110 Stat. 3009–711; Pub. L. 108–293, title II, §223, Aug. 9, 2004, 118 Stat. 1040; Pub. L. 115–232, div. C, title XXXV, §3548(a), Aug. 13, 2018, 132 Stat. 2328; Pub. L. 115–282, title IV, §407(b)(1)–(4), Dec. 4, 2018, 132 Stat. 4267, which was formerly classified to section 191 of Title 50, War and National Defense, before being transferred to this chapter and renumbered as this section. Prior to such renumbering and transfer, section 3548(a) of Pub. L. 115–232 amended section 1 of title II of act June 15, 1917, by substituting "the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating" for "the Secretary of the Treasury" in the first par. Subsequently, section 407(b)(2) of Pub. L. 115–282 directed striking out "of the Treasury" but could not be executed because of the amendment by Pub. L. 115–232. Section 407(b)(3) of Pub. L. 115–282 further directed striking out "of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating", which appeared in two places following the amendment by Pub. L. 115–232, but the amendment did not specify where the deletion should occur. The amendment was executed by striking out such phrase following "regulations to the Secretary" in concluding provisions, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.
<br>Amendments
<br>
<br>2021—Pub. L. 116–283 substituted "immediate Federal response, the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating may make, subject to the approval" for "immediate Federal response, the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating may make, subject to the approval" in introductory provisions and "authority to issue such rules and regulations to the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating. Any appropriation" for "authority to issue such rules and regulations to the Secretary. Any appropriation" in concluding provisions.

<br>
<br>WHEREAS, on February 24, 1996, Cuban military aircraft intercepted and destroyed two unarmed U.S.-registered civilian aircraft in international airspace north of Cuba;
<br>
<br>WHEREAS the Government of Cuba has demonstrated a ready and reckless willingness to use excessive force, including deadly force, in the ostensible enforcement of its sovereignty;
<br>
<br>WHEREAS, on July 13, 1995, persons in U.S.-registered vessels who entered into Cuban territorial waters suffered injury as a result of the reckless use of force against them by the Cuban military; and
<br>
<br>WHEREAS the entry of U.S.-registered vessels into Cuban territorial waters could again result in injury to, or loss of life of, persons engaged in that conduct, due to the potential use of excessive force, including deadly force, against them by the Cuban military, and could threaten a disturbance in international relations;
<br>
<br>NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 1 of title II of Public Law 65-24, ch. 30, June 15, 1917, as amended (50 U.S.C. 191) [see 46 U.S.C. 70051], sections 201 and 301 of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) [50 U.S.C. 1621, 1631], and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, find and do hereby proclaim that a national emergency does exist by reason of a disturbance or threatened disturbance of international relations. In order to address this national emergency and to secure the observance of the rights and obligations of the United States, I hereby authorize and direct the Secretary of Transportation (the "Secretary") to make and issue such rules and regulations as the Secretary may find appropriate to regulate the anchorage and movement of vessels, and delegate to the Secretary my authority to approve such rules and regulations, as authorized by the Act of June 15, 1917 [see Tables for classification].
<br>
<br>Section 1. The Secretary may make rules and regulations governing the anchorage and movement of any vessel, foreign or domestic, in the territorial waters of the United States, which may be used, or is susceptible of being used, for voyage into Cuban territorial waters and that may create unsafe conditions and threaten a disturbance of international relations. Any rule or regulation issued pursuant to this proclamation may be effective immediately upon issuance as such rule or regulation shall involve a foreign affairs function of the United States.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. The Secretary is authorized to inspect any vessel, foreign or domestic, in the territorial waters of the United States, at any time; to place guards on any such vessel; and, with my consent expressly hereby granted, take full possession and control of any such vessel and remove the officers and crew, and all other persons not specifically authorized by the Secretary to go or remain on board the vessel when necessary to secure the rights and obligations of the United States.
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. The Secretary may request assistance from such departments, agencies, officers, or instrumentalities of the United States as the Secretary deems necessary to carry out the purposes of this proclamation. Such departments, agencies, officers, or instrumentalities shall, consistent with other provisions of law and to the extent practicable, provide requested assistance.
<br>
<br>Sec. 4. The Secretary may seek assistance from State and local authorities in carrying out the purposes of this proclamation. Because State and local assistance may be essential for an effective response to this emergency, I urge all State and local officials to cooperate with Federal authorities and to take all actions within their lawful authority necessary to prevent the unauthorized departure of vessels intending to enter Cuban territorial waters.
<br>
<br>Sec. 5. All powers and authorities delegated by this proclamation to the Secretary may be delegated by the Secretary to other officers and agents of the United States Government unless otherwise prohibited by law.
<br>
<br>Sec. 6. This proclamation shall be immediately transmitted to the Congress and published in the Federal Register.
<br>
<br>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twentieth.
<br>
<br>William J. Clinton.

<br>[Provisions of Proc. No. 6867 superseded to the extent of inconsistency with provisions of Procs. No. 7757, 9398, and 9699, see Sec. 6 of Proc. No. 7757, Sec. 6 of Proc. No. 9398, and Sec. 6 of Proc. No. 9699, set out below.]
<br>Continuation of National Emergency Declared by Proc. No. 6867
<br>
<br>Notice of President of the United States, dated Feb. 25, 2020, 85 F.R. 11825, provided:
<br>
<br>On March 1, 1996, by Proclamation 6867, a national emergency was declared to address the disturbance or threatened disturbance of international relations caused by the February 24, 1996, destruction by the Cuban government of two unarmed United States-registered civilian aircraft in international airspace north of Cuba. On February 26, 2004, by Proclamation 7757 [46 U.S.C. 70051 note], the national emergency was expanded to deny monetary and material support to the Cuban government. On February 24, 2016, by Proclamation 9398, and on February 22, 2018, by Proclamation 9699 [46 U.S.C. 70051 notes], the national emergency was further modified based on continued disturbances or threatened disturbances of the international relations of the United States related to Cuba. The Cuban government has not demonstrated that it will refrain from the use of excessive force against United States vessels or aircraft that may engage in memorial activities or peaceful protest north of Cuba.
<br>
<br>In addition, the unauthorized entry of any United States-registered vessel into Cuban territorial waters continues to be detrimental to the foreign policy of the United States because such entry could facilitate a mass migration from Cuba. It continues to be United States policy that a mass migration from Cuba would endanger the security of the United States by posing a disturbance or threatened disturbance of the international relations of the United States. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national emergency with respect to Cuba and the emergency authority relating to the regulation of the anchorage and movement of vessels set out in Proclamation 6867, as amended by Proclamation 7757, Proclamation 9398, and Proclamation 9699.
<br>
<br>This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.

<br>Proc. No. 7757. Expanding the Scope of the National Emergency and Invocation of Emergency Authority Relating to the Regulation of the Anchorage and Movement of Vessels into Cuban Territorial Waters
<br>
<br>Proc. No. 7757, Feb. 26, 2004, 69 F.R. 9515, provided:
<br>
<br>By the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, in order to expand the scope of the national emergency declared in Proclamation 6867 of March 1, 1996 [set out above], based on the disturbance or threatened disturbance of the international relations of the United States caused by actions taken by the Cuban government, and in light of steps taken over the past year by the Cuban government to worsen the threat to United States international relations, and,
<br>
<br>WHEREAS the United States has determined that Cuba is a state-sponsor of terrorism and it is subject to the restrictions of [former] section 6(j)(1)(A) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 [former 50 U.S.C. 4605(j)(1)(A)], section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [22 U.S.C. 2371], and section 40 of the Arms Export Control Act [22 U.S.C. 2780];
<br>
<br>WHEREAS the Cuban government has demonstrated a ready and reckless willingness to use excessive force, including deadly force, against U.S. citizens, in the ostensible enforcement of its sovereignty, including the February 1996 shoot-down of two unarmed U.S.-registered civilian aircraft in international airspace, resulting in the deaths of three American citizens and one other individual;
<br>
<br>WHEREAS the Cuban government has demonstrated a ready and reckless willingness to use excessive force, including deadly force, against U.S. citizens and its own citizens, including on July 13, 1995, when persons in U.S.-registered vessels that entered into Cuban territorial waters suffered injury as a result of the reckless use of force against them by the Cuban military, and including the July 1994 sinking of an unarmed Cuban-registered vessel, resulting in the deaths of 41 Cuban citizens;
<br>
<br>WHEREAS the Cuban government has impounded U.S.-registered vessels in Cuban ports and forced the owners, as a condition of release, to violate U.S. law by requiring payments to be made to the Cuban government;
<br>
<br>WHEREAS the entry of any U.S.-registered vessels into Cuban territorial waters could result in injury to, or loss of life of, persons engaged in that conduct, due to the potential use of excessive force, including deadly force, against them by the Cuban military, and could threaten a disturbance of international relations;
<br>
<br>WHEREAS the unauthorized entry of vessels subject to the jurisdiction of the United States into Cuban territorial waters is in violation of U.S. law and contrary to U.S. policy;
<br>
<br>WHEREAS the objectives of U.S. policy regarding Cuba are the end of the dictatorship and a rapid, peaceful transition to a representative democracy respectful of human rights and characterized by an open market economic system;
<br>
<br>WHEREAS a critical initiative by the United States to advance these U.S. objectives is to deny resources to the repressive Cuban government, resources that may be used by that government to support terrorist activities and carry out excessive use of force against innocent victims, including U.S. citizens;
<br>
<br>WHEREAS the unauthorized entry of U.S.-registered vessels into Cuban territorial waters is detrimental to the foreign policy of the United States, which is to deny monetary and material support to the repressive Cuban government, and, therefore, such unauthorized entries threaten to disturb the international relations of the United States by facilitating the Cuban government's support of terrorism, use of excessive force, and continued existence;
<br>
<br>WHEREAS the Cuban government has over the course of its 45-year existence repeatedly used violence and the threat of violence to undermine U.S. policy interests. This same regime continues in power today, and has since 1959 maintained a pattern of hostile actions contrary to U.S. policy interests. Among other things, the Cuban government established a military alliance with the Soviet Union, and invited Soviet forces to install nuclear missiles in Cuba capable of attacking the United States, and encouraged Soviet authorities to use those weapons against the United States; it engaged in military adventurism in Africa; and it helped to form and provide material and political support to terrorist organizations that sought the violent overthrow of democratically elected governments in Central America and elsewhere in the hemisphere allied with the United States, thereby causing repeated disturbances of U.S. international relations;
<br>
<br>WHEREAS the Cuban government has recently and over the last year taken a series of steps to destabilize relations with the United States, including threatening to abrogate the Migration Accords with the United States and to close the U.S. Interests Section, and Cuba's most senior officials repeatedly asserting that the United States intended to invade Cuba, despite explicit denials from the U.S. Secretaries of State and Defense that such action is planned, thereby causing a sudden and worsening disturbance of U.S. international relations;
<br>
<br>WHEREAS U.S. concerns about these unforeseen Cuban government actions that threaten to disturb international relations were sufficiently grave that on May 8, 2003, the United States warned the Cuban government that political manipulations that resulted in a mass migration would be viewed as a "hostile act;"
<br>
<br>NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 1 of title II of Public Law 65–24, ch. 30, June 15, 1917, as amended (50 U.S.C. 191) [see 46 U.S.C. 70051], sections 201 and 301 of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) [50 U.S.C. 1621, 1631], and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, in order to expand the scope of the national emergency declared in Proclamation 6867 of March 1, 1996 [set out above], and to secure the observance of the rights and obligations of the United States, hereby authorize and direct the Secretary of Homeland Security (the "Secretary") to make and issue such rules and regulations as the Secretary may find appropriate to regulate the anchorage and movement of vessels, and authorize and approve the Secretary's issuance of such rules and regulations, as authorized by the Act of June 15, 1917 [see Tables for classification].
<br>
<br>Section 1. The Secretary may make rules and regulations governing the anchorage and movement of any vessel, foreign or domestic, in the territorial waters of the United States, which may be used, or is susceptible of being used, for voyage into Cuban territorial waters and that may create unsafe conditions, or result in unauthorized transactions, and thereby threaten a disturbance of international relations. Any rule or regulation issued pursuant to this proclamation may be effective immediately upon issuance as such rule or regulation shall involve a foreign affairs function of the United States.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. The Secretary is authorized to inspect any vessel, foreign or domestic, in the territorial waters of the United States, at any time; to place guards on any such vessel; and, with my consent expressly hereby granted, take full possession and control of any such vessel and remove the officers and crew and all other persons not specifically authorized by the Secretary to go or remain on board the vessel when necessary to secure the rights and obligations of the United States.
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. The Secretary may request assistance from such departments, agencies, officers, or instrumentalities of the United States as the Secretary deems necessary to carry out the purposes of this proclamation. Such departments, agencies, officers, or instrumentalities shall, consistent with other provisions of law and to the extent practicable, provide requested assistance.
<br>
<br>Sec. 4. The Secretary may seek assistance from State and local authorities in carrying out the purposes of this proclamation. Because State and local assistance may be essential for an effective response to this emergency, I urge all State and local officials to cooperate with Federal authorities and to take all actions within their lawful authority necessary to prevent the unauthorized departure of vessels intending to enter Cuban territorial waters.

<br>
<br>Sec. 7. This proclamation shall be immediately transmitted to the Congress and published in the Federal Register.
<br>
<br>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-eighth.

<br>
<br>WHEREAS the descriptions of the national emergency set forth in Proclamations 6867 and 7757 no longer reflect the international relations of the United States related to Cuba;
<br>
<br>WHEREAS longstanding U.S. policy towards Cuba had, at times, tended to isolate the United States from regional and international partners, constrained our ability to influence outcomes throughout the Western Hemisphere, and impaired the use of the full range of tools available to the United States to promote positive change in Cuba;
<br>
<br>WHEREAS the following descriptions accurately describe the national emergency with respect to Cuba;
<br>
<br>WHEREAS the United States and Cuba reestablished diplomatic relations and opened embassies in each other's capitals on July 20, 2015, and the United States continues to pursue the progressive normalization of relations while aspiring towards a peaceful, prosperous, and democratic Cuba;

<br>WHEREAS the United States is committed to supporting safe, orderly, and legal migration from Cuba through the effective implementation of the 1994–95 U.S.-Cuba Migration Accords;
<br>
<br>WHEREAS the Cuban economy is in a relatively weak state, contributing to an outflow of its nationals towards the United States and neighboring countries;
<br>
<br>WHEREAS the overarching objective of U.S. policy is stability in the region, and the outflow of Cuban nationals may have a destabilizing effect on the United States and its neighboring countries;

<br>
<br>WHEREAS the unauthorized entry of vessels subject to the jurisdiction of the United States into Cuban territorial waters is in violation of U.S. law and contrary to U.S. policy;
<br>
<br>WHEREAS the unauthorized entry of United States-registered vessels into Cuban territorial waters is detrimental to the foreign policy of the United States, and counter to the purpose of Executive Order 12807 [8 U.S.C. 1182 note], which is to ensure, among other things, safe, orderly, and legal migration;

<br>
<br>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 1 of title II of Public Law 65–24, ch. 30, June 15, 1917, as amended (50 U.S.C. 191) [see 46 U.S.C. 70051], sections 201, 202, and 301 of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, in order to modify the scope of the national emergency declared in Proclamations 6867, 7757, and 9398, and to secure the observance of the rights and obligations of the United States, hereby continue the national emergency declared in Proclamations 6867, 7757, and 9398, and authorize and direct the Secretary of Homeland Security (the "Secretary") to make and issue such rules and regulations as the Secretary may find appropriate to regulate the anchorage and movement of vessels, and delegate to the Secretary my authority to approve such rules and regulations, as authorized by the Act of June 15, 1917. Accordingly, I hereby direct as follows:
<br>
<br>Section 1. The Secretary may make rules and regulations governing the anchorage and movement of any vessel, foreign or domestic, in the territorial waters of the United States, that may be used, or is susceptible of being used, for voyage into Cuban territorial waters and that may create unsafe conditions, or result in unauthorized transactions, thereby threatening a disturbance of international relations. A rule or regulation issued pursuant to this proclamation may be effective immediately upon issuance if it involves a foreign affairs function of the United States.
<br>
<br>Sec. 2. The Secretary is authorized, to the extent consistent with international law, to inspect any vessel, foreign or domestic, in the territorial waters of the United States, at any time; to place guards on any such vessel; and, with my consent expressly hereby granted, take full possession and control of any such vessel and remove the officers and crew and all other persons not specifically authorized by the Secretary to go or remain on board the vessel, when necessary to secure the rights and obligations of the United States.
<br>
<br>Sec. 3. The Secretary may request assistance from such departments, agencies, officers, or instrumentalities of the United States as necessary to carry out the purposes of this proclamation. Such departments, agencies, officers, or instrumentalities shall, consistent with other provisions of law and to the extent practicable, provide the assistance requested.
<br>
<br>Sec. 4. The Secretary may seek assistance from State and local authorities in carrying out the purposes of this proclamation. Because State and local assistance may be essential for an effective response to this emergency, I urge all State and local officials to cooperate with Federal authorities and to take all actions within their lawful authority necessary to prevent the unauthorized departure of vessels intending to enter Cuban territorial waters.
<br>
<br>Sec. 5. All powers and authorities delegated by this proclamation to the Secretary may be delegated by the Secretary to other officers and agents of the United States Government consistent with applicable law.
<br>
<br>Sec. 6. Any provisions of Proclamations 6867, 7757, or 9398 that are inconsistent with the provisions of this proclamation are superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
<br>
<br>Sec. 7. This proclamation shall be immediately transmitted to the Congress and published in the Federal Register.
<br>
<br>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand eighteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-second.
<br>
<br>Donald J. Trump.

<br>
<br>Pub. L. 108–458, title IV, §4071, Dec. 17, 2004, 118 Stat. 3729, provided that:
<br>
<br>"(a) Watch Lists.—
<br>
<br>"(1) In general.—As soon as practicable but not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act [Dec. 17, 2004], the Secretary of Homeland Security shall—
<br>
<br>"(A) implement a procedure under which the Department of Homeland Security compares information about passengers and crew who are to be carried aboard a cruise ship with a comprehensive, consolidated database containing information about known or suspected terrorists and their associates;
<br>

<br>Findings
<br>
<br>Pub. L. 107–295, title I, §101, Nov. 25, 2002, 116 Stat. 2066, provided that:
<br>
<br>"The Congress makes the following findings:
<br>
<br>"(1) There are 361 public ports in the United States that are an integral part of our Nation's commerce.
<br>
<br>"(2) United States ports handle over 95 percent of United States overseas trade. The total volume of goods imported and exported through ports is expected to more than double over the next 20 years.
<br>
<br>"(3) The variety of trade and commerce carried out at ports includes bulk cargo, containerized cargo, passenger transport and tourism, and intermodal transportation systems that are complex to secure.
<br>
<br>"(4) The United States is increasingly dependent on imported energy for a substantial share of its energy supply, and a disruption of that share of supply would seriously harm consumers and our economy.
<br>
<br>"(5) The top 50 ports in the United States account for about 90 percent of all the cargo tonnage. Twenty-five United States ports account for 98 percent of all container shipments. Cruise ships visiting foreign destinations embark from at least 16 ports. Ferries in the United States transport 113,000,000 passengers and 32,000,000 vehicles per year.
<br>
<br>"(6) Ports often are a major locus of Federal crime, including drug trafficking, cargo theft, and smuggling of contraband and aliens.
<br>
<br>"(7) Ports are often very open and exposed and are susceptible to large scale acts of terrorism that could cause a large loss of life or economic disruption.
<br>
<br>"(8) Current inspection levels of containerized cargo are insufficient to counter potential security risks. Technology is currently not adequately deployed to allow for the nonintrusive inspection of containerized cargo.
<br>
<br>"(9) The cruise ship industry poses a special risk from a security perspective.
<br>
<br>"(10) Securing entry points and other areas of port facilities and examining or inspecting containers would increase security at United States ports.
<br>
<br>"(11) Biometric identification procedures for individuals having access to secure areas in port facilities are important tools to deter and prevent port cargo crimes, smuggling, and terrorist actions.
<br>
<br>"(12) United States ports are international boundaries that—
<br>
<br>"(A) are particularly vulnerable to breaches in security;
<br>
<br>"(B) may present weaknesses in the ability of the United States to realize its national security objectives; and
<br>
<br>"(C) may serve as a vector or target for terrorist attacks aimed at the United States.
<br>
<br>"(13) It is in the best interests of the United States—
<br>
<br>"(A) to have a free flow of interstate and foreign commerce and to ensure the efficient movement of cargo;
<br>
<br>"(B) to increase United States port security by establishing improving communication among law enforcement officials responsible for port security;
<br>
<br>"(C) to formulate requirements for physical port security, recognizing the different character and nature of United States port facilities, and to require the establishment of security programs at port facilities;
<br>
<br>"(D) to provide financial assistance to help the States and the private sector to increase physical security of United States ports;
<br>
<br>"(E) to invest in long-term technology to facilitate the private sector development of technology that will assist in the nonintrusive timely detection of crime or potential crime at United States ports;
<br>
<br>"(F) to increase intelligence collection on cargo and intermodal movements to address areas of potential threat to safety and security; and
<br>
<br>"(G) to promote private sector procedures that provide for in-transit visibility and support law enforcement efforts directed at managing the security risks of cargo shipments.
<br>
<br>"(14) On April 27, 1999, the President established the Interagency Commission on Crime and Security in United States Ports to undertake a comprehensive study of the nature and extent of the problem of crime in our ports, as well as the ways in which governments at all levels are responding. The Commission concluded that frequent crimes in ports include drug smuggling, illegal car exports, fraud, and cargo theft. Internal conspiracies are an issue at many ports and contribute to Federal crime. Criminal organizations are exploiting weak security at ports to commit a wide range of cargo crimes. Intelligence and information sharing among law enforcement agencies needs to be improved and coordinated at many ports. A lack of minimum physical and personnel security standards at ports and related facilities leaves many ports and port users very vulnerable. Access to ports and operations within ports is often uncontrolled. Security-related and detection-related equipment, such as small boats, cameras, large-scale x-ray machines, and vessel tracking devices, are lacking at many ports.
<br>
<br>"(15) The International Maritime Organization and other similar international organizations are currently developing a new maritime security system that contains the essential elements for enhancing global maritime security. Therefore, it is in the best interests of the United States to implement new international instruments that establish such a system."
